5575918,comment,5575277,5575277,9,0,kozlovsky,,,"Hi, I'm Alexander Kozlovsky, one of Pony ORM authors.\nI'll try to answer some questions<p>> why such an obsession with ""pure"" Python?<p>With this statement we are trying to say Pony is not just to offer some syntax sugar. The end goal of Pony ORM is to understand the semantic of each Python generator which can be translated to database query and then do translation accordingly.<p>The direct benefit of this is that generator query are more high-level then resulted SQL, and can be much easier to understand and refactor. The simplest example is an automatic converting of attribute path traversing such as grade.student.group.department.name to a minimal set of SQL joins. Pony also can use attribute path in reverse direction, from one to many, such as department.groups.students.gpa, which in this case resulted in a multiset of all gpa values for this department. Also you can see examples of query optimization in the documentation, for example when the subquery is converted to LEFT JOIN with GROUP BY, where it can give performance benefit.<p>There are more distant benefits of the semantic translation. In future, we plan to add support of denormalized database schemas. Such denormalization will take place on a physical level (i.e. in the database) while on the logical level (in Python) all queries and logic will remain the same. But first of all we are going to add the migration support.<p>Another future plan is to add support of MongoDB. This is a distant plan, but I think Pony architecture will allow this. After that, migration of PonyORM-based project from relational databases to noSQL and vice versa will be possible.<p>> An ORM like Django's offers a higher level of abstraction<p>I disagree with this. I think, any Django query can be written in PonyORM much more concisely, and there are easy-to-understand PonyORM queries which cannot be expressed in Django easily.<p>Also, Pony ORM completely eliminates N+1 select problem.",1366369181

First off ""insane"" is a completely non-precise term, and I strongly believe a clarification of psychological framework be made before the discussion actually begins. Let's stop wasting time on this. Let's stop throwing around ""type"" systems in CS but not in Psych, which are both supposed to be sciences.<p>I sent this to some developer (acting as a recruiter) for a prominent SF company during a bar run (he was looking for front-end devs not with 10+ startups under their belt but with someone they're looking to mold):<p>The Web is a hypermedia application. So we're building pretty much <a href=""http://schema.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://schema.org/</a> vocabularies implemented over models (Django, Rails, etc.) with hypermedia specs (front-end begging for more data in more stupid ways than anyone cares to document).<p>Look. You want kids who'll acclimate better than the Chinese or Russians to text editors like LightTable and who enjoy the pleasures of vim-seek.<p>And you want an actual Web, or at least people who have dreams which logically entail that such a thing is possible (dreams of mundane facts).<p>So what am I getting at? What are you dreams restricted by? Is it this or that job? What are you building? What am I building? And what why does it seem that we should be building these things, by our evolution? Demanding high-pay? Insane? What are you talking about? ""High-pay""? ""Insane""?<p>What does any of this have to do with the Internet Declaration of Independence? Why are you inheriting this psychological framework? Why haven't you consumed post-structuralism? Why is your Internet ""American""?<p>Again: ""Insane""?<p>That's in your headline. In your headline.

5575899,comment,5575144,5575577,6,0,kevingadd,,,"Do you even have any anecdotes to support this? I have literally never encountered an example of an employer proactively managing an employee's stress level. To suggest that an employer can somehow put employees at 'an optimum amount of stress' suggests a lot more understanding of employees than I think is possible in most scenarios.<p>I mean, yeah, we can spout platitudes all we want here. I agree that if you aspire to be a good employer, you should treat your employees well. But that's not the problem here: The example employee in the OP was a top performer who helped solve tough problems, and nobody seemed to suspect that anything was wrong until he snapped.<p>The problem is that workplaces are not designed to be able to identify an employee having problems with stress, let alone to actively manage it. I have never encountered a workplace that can do so effectively - some employers are better than others about things like work/life balance, etc. But the level of stress in your life is variable, and the level of stress being generated by your work is variable, even in the best of circumstances. It is difficult, if not impossible, for an employer to even understand how much stress you might be under outside of work.<p>For example, a lead artist at a previous employer got let go for getting into too many arguments at work. It was only at that point that we learned that he was having a really tough time because he was a single parent and his son was suffering from a severe, life-threatening condition. It's nice to think that if his supervisors had known they could have done something about it - maybe they would have - but from the outside it merely made him look like a bad employee. Maybe he wanted to keep his personal life private, maybe he thought he had it under control, or maybe they decided they had to set an example regardless of his reasons - but the point stands: Ultimately, it is up to you, not your employer, to manage your stress.",1366368814

5575895,comment,5573181,5574236,7,0,Silhouette,,,"You keep banging on this drum as if you're going to somehow name and shame big businesses for making perfectly reasonable business decisions.<p>Please understand that a web browser is just a software tool like any other. You don't install a web browser at your business so you can say you use some bleeding edge shiny. You install a web browser to get some useful job done. Much of the time, that involves accessing in-house systems. Some of the time, maybe it involves accessing the external WWW, perhaps to research or buy something. Supporting the latest browsers so everyone can spend even longer playing on-line games or posting on Facebook is, shall we say, not a business priority.<p>Now, please understand that perhaps the single most important attribute for most large businesses with significant IT operations and mostly non-technical staff is predictability. If everyone is running on a stable software foundation, then tools can be built on top of that foundation. If everyone is running the same version of their end user software, then help desk staff can provide canned step-by-step guides to doing things, or remotely access someone's machine to fix a problem or guide a user through a new process for the first time. If every server in a group is running the same operating system distribution then you only have to keep track of one set of security patches and apply them uniformly. And so it goes on.<p>In this context, it is entirely reasonable that businesses ""refuse to run modern browsers"". Your modern browsers do stupid things like <i>moving the goalposts every six weeks</i> (or every few months if you jump through special hoops to use a laughably named long-term support version). Your modern browsers include new technologies that <i>introduce security and privacy risks</i> we didn't have before. Your modern browsers <i>break backwards compatibility</i> and won't run the $5,000,000 bespoke CRM package on our intranet any more! And in most cases, your modern browsers <i>offer no business benefit</i> compared to the tried and tested tools already in use.<p>In short, while <i>you</i> may wish that everyone ran the latest shiny new browser, there are very good reasons why many big businesses don't. If you think the guys running IT for those places somehow didn't notice that there are other options or just can't be bothered to upgrade or suffer from ""intellectual sloth"" then you really have no idea how things work at that level at all.",1366368806

If your perspective is that of a maker/hacker then good work (which should be rewarded) is to make great things, things please people and improve their lives, and perhaps profit the company. If your goal is maximising profit for the company, sometimes good ideas will need to be canned or replaced by bad ones the customer wants, sometimes work will need to be stopped after much effort was put in, sometimes politics will override technical considerations. If your goal is maximising profit for the individual at minimal cost, you want others to do the work while you get the rewards, and neither the business nor other workers, nor their pet projects, are your concern - more fool them if they take the company propaganda as truth, believe they are living in a meritocracy, and don't realise the realities of workplace politics. From the perpective of a manager who has climbed the greasy pole to luxury while workers suffer horrible working conditions, who is the idiot?<p>I would argue that classifying people as idiots is not useful and obscures the real differences in outlook which produce this sort of friction. There are many other perspectives to work (not tied to specific roles like manager or programmer I hasten to add), and holding them does not make people idiots, in fact many others might view someone slaving away for a company in the misapprehension that they are improving the world as an idiot; both would be wrong. The best way to deal with this IMHO is to recognise that workplaces have a culture, which contains and controls many different aspirations, and if you find this culture toxic, you should change job if at all possible - it is very hard to change a company culture or the perspectives of other workers on their work. Also, work should not be your only passion if you want to remain sane.",1366367849

I love my job, but it requires a good deal of interaction with clients, which never fails to stress me out.  Combine that with relationship nonsense and a general vicious cycle of pain (due to an injury causing chronic pain) and depression, and it's led to a situation where I'm spiraling out of control.<p>After many years of being fairly stable, I started self-harming again and ending up in these obsessive thought loops, culminating in thoughts of death and (occasionally) suicide.  Now, I know myself well enough to know that I'm not going to commit suicide (I've been <i>far</i> worse than I am right now, and I've managed to pull myself away from that; I enjoy life entirely too much for suicide, even if things suck right now.  I still have hope for the future, and that's not something I see changing.), but this is obviously not healthy.  I know I need help, but I have a few problems:<p>Problem #1: I can't find a therapist I can actually trust and connect with.  I have serious problems talking to people in real life, so I attempted online therapy; every one I tried was a complete and utter waste of hundreds of dollars.  I don't know that I'd go so far as to call them scams, but I wouldn't feel bad about doing so.  Regardless, text-based therapy would make a <i>huge</i> difference for me, and I just can't find anything that Doesn't Suck (TM).<p>Problem #2: I've been looking at treatment facilities to just go there, disconnect from the world, and focus on getting better.  But I have a job, bills to pay (that can be dealt with by savings, assuming I have a job when I'm out), and responsibilities.  I know about FMLA leaves of absence, but that requires you (!) to disclose your illness to your employee; given the massive stigma around mental illness, I really, really dislike that option.  All of this, of course, means I feel even more pressure; even in treatment I would feel that pressure.<p>So, HN, what do I do?  Problem #2 would be awesome to solve, but problem #1 is the big one; without ongoing therapy, any help I get isn't going to be sustained.  I know there's a solution here, and I know I can get better.  I'm optimistic about the future for many reasons, and I want to stop feeling like the sky is falling every 15 minutes.<p>Sorry for threadjacking, and thank you all.",1366367434

Real learning. We drop tools to educate each other, to teach and learn. We really believe doing so is the key to producing good work faster, that works with the output of everyone else.",1366366326

Local press reports say that Boston police have\n  identified him as a suspect.\n\n  Mr Tripathi is described as a left-wing Marxist of \n  Indian Brahmin descent, whose father is a successful\n  software developer. His family set up a Twitter account\n  and a Facebook page last month to help the search for \n  him. Mr Tripathi was first identified as a suspect in a\n  crowdsleuthing exercise on the Reddit website.\n\n  The other suspect, who was wearing the black hat, has \n  been named as Mike Mulugeta.

ORMs are great for covering basic, repetitive queries, but there are times where it's not producing what you need. Of course you then loose the portability feature of ORMs, but I think this is acceptable. The biggest advantage for me isn't generation of SQL, it's mapping data back into your domain model/DTOs.",1366366069

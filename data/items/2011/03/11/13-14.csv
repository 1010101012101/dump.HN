Then I started doing other things with it than just coding, and it moved me to a whole new level.<p>I started writing text, stuff like my blog and emails, and suddenly a whole lot of extra commands started to make sense.  For example, block commands like '}' and ')', and formatting with 'gqap', and so on.  I was now doing really powerful stuff at the word, line, sentence and paragraph levels.  Before I could do 'cw' and be happy; I knew there was a 'cW', but who could be bothered.  Now I really understand and I can use all that without thinking.<p>Then I was able to take those new skills back to writing code, so my vim-fu when coding is so much more powerful.

As others have said the $5 is simply a push to do something that probably should have been done before.<p>In light of this I am personally in favor of simply taking the binary pkgs out of the xcode dmg, in pursuit of maximum compatibility and minimum duping, and general adherence to homebrew's stated project goals.<p>However this would obviously require some research as to the specific licensing issues involved, and some dialog with apple.

I am sure each person here has at least a few abandoned software projects that they either couldn't finish, didn't want to finish, or at some point later regret not finishing.<p>I would like to hear those stories, it would be interesting.<p>One of mine is I built a web based blogging application in 2002/03 which was supposed to kick MovableType's ass. I had beta testers with great product feedback, but just simply got distracted with another project, thought blogging would never be that popular, and just abandoned it. I even let the domains expire (one of the hosting domains was bloguser.com). I wrote a lot of code for that project, including Javascript in the text editor so you could select and make text bold etc.<p>The other was discovering the original IE 5.0 xmlhttprequest while working on a corporate intranet role (this was in 99-00 IIRC). I remember thinking 'this is awesome, literally every desktop app is going to be written as a web app, I should totally quit my job and setup a company to do web email, web word processor, etc. with fancy javascript'.

2313281,comment,2313092,2313092,0,0,_delirium,,,"For weather, which I find more natural depends somewhat on the climate. In Denmark, the celsius system seems quite natural, even as an American. Freezing being at 0 C is a reasonable reference point; below it is cold, above it is okay, >10C above it is warm, >20C above it is grilling on the beach. I find it a bit less natural in Greece, though admittedly it may be different if I had grown up there. The main awkwardness is that I find myself mentioning specific temperatures more often; it seems that the colloquial equivalent for an expression like ""low 70s"" is ""around 22"".<p>I don't have a problem with people using whatever they want, though. In scientific and engineering work I'd stick to C, but I don't see great benefits from consistency in daily life; it's not hard to approximately convert in your head. The way I usually do it is to start at an approximate reference point suitable for the climate, like 0 C/30 F or 20 C/70 F, and then have the F temperature be twice as far from the reference point as the C temperature. None of those numbers are quite right, of course, but it's easy in my head to say that 5 C = 40 F or 80 F = 25 C, which are 1-2 degrees off but close enough for discussing the weather.",1299851350

Rather, it's that people think they somehow have a right to use Twitter's services and accounts like they were their property. The same goes for people who build businesses on Facebook and every other monolithic site. I think users need to understand that they are on someone else's turf, and they are subject to whatever the company decides to do. There is no reasonable expectation of fairness, or of free speech for that matter.<p>That's why building a business on Twitter is foolish. I hear it's done successfully all the time, yet people have to understand this is a very shaky foundation. We're not even Twitter's customers. Advertisers are Twitter's customers.

That's like a tiny little asterisk point down at the bottom of your feature list.  The best thing about your project should be that it's useful for doing X.<p>I never got as far as finding out what X actually was, and why this was going to be better than the existing tools out there.<p>But I did learn what file format you save projects in.  Yikes.  Developers, stop talking about development stuff.  Nobody cares about the technical details.  Nobody cares about Open Source.  Talk about your <i>product</i>.",1299848970

2313162,comment,2313081,2313081,0,0,nupark,,,"This is silly -- these are just blind leading the blind questions. I guess I can provide some answers ...<p>- homebrew should just provide binaries rather than trying to bootstrap a compiler for everyone.<p>- Barring that, homebrew should wait and see if Xcode4 is free with Lion.<p>- A compiler isn't enough. You also need an assembler, linker, etc. Those can be found in Apple's cctoolz and ld64 projects.<p>- Headers are are also required. Those belong to Apple and are not freely redistributable.<p>- GCC 4.2 is still the default, not clang. Apple still builds the majority of the OS with GCC.<p>- Apple does modify the compiler. Look at PLBlocks (<a href=""http://code.google.com/p/plblocks/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://code.google.com/p/plblocks/</a>) for scripts that can drive an Apple compiler build.<p>- homebrew is learning why ""do not dupe"" is not viable when dealing with Apple in the longterm, and is going to just wind up being a less mature macports clone after going through a few more release cycles.",1299848758

In fact, I just received a notification that a new version was ready.<p>And up to that point Apple was slowly killing Java development on the Mac. Updates were less frequent and ages behind other platforms. And you only had one choice to get the JDK, Apple. At least with Oracle, it's assumed, updates should be arriving regularly and in line with other platforms.<p>Which is what Apple was saying all along when the controversy started.",1299848546

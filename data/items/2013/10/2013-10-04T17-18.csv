It is true that Apple spends a lot of time on visual design and polishing the limited set of scenarios to their complete satisfaction, but I don&#x27;t think is can be called perfect.<p>For example, first version of iPhone OS did not have copy-paste functionality. On a device that has keyboard with keys sized 1/4 of my fingertip size. Now try getting a long URL or email from one app to another in this setup. Perfect? Yeah, right.<p>Another iOS thing - it gained multitasking (for apps other than select few) only in the 4th version. For years we&#x27;ve been told multitasking is evil - right up to the point when they got to make it usable and then it suddenly became newesest bestesest thing ever.<p>Now we can look at hardware. Macbooks are extremely popular, but I&#x27;ve personally seen a number of Macbooks dying at 2 years of age from exactly the same symptoms (failure of graphics subsystem). It&#x27;s a reasonably nice piece of hardware, but perfect? No way. And it still doesn&#x27;t have docking capability, after all these years.<p>And those are just random things, if I tried, I probably could list dozens of deficiencies in Apple products. Both first and current versions. It doesn&#x27;t make them especially bad - all their competitors have their sets of faults - but let&#x27;s not buy into the &quot;perfect&quot; hype too much.<p>So I can attribute this &quot;perfect the first time&quot; myth to a definite success of Apple marketing, but, unfortunately, there&#x27;s little substance behind it.",1380909585

6496865,comment,6492781,6494970,3,0,hosh,,,"What makes someone creepy has nothing to do with the guy who comes off as creepy. Creepiness is an internal experience indicating that you (the person feeling creeped out) are uncomfortable and disturbed.<p>In this case, I would hazard most straight guys who read this article and feel disturbed are disturbed that someone can induce a state of homosexual attraction within them. Further, aside from the obvious fear of homosexual attraction, there&#x27;s also the empathy for women who are subjected to methods like this.<p>It&#x27;s easy to rationalize some form of this behavior as &quot;fair game&quot;. Would you still consider it fair game if you put yourself in that Marine&#x27;s shoes, or in a woman&#x27;s shoes, being subject to methods like this? Maybe, maybe not.<p>The sociopath sees his victims as an object, as something that he can play with and exercises his power. He gets off on being able to take a straight guy -- and I suppose, one idealized in the form of an ultra-macho Marine -- and seduce him, the power to turn him into something he is not. (Then kill him).<p>No one likes being treated like an object.<p>I&#x27;ve seen this kind of rationalization in many of the pick-up artist material, rendering the person into an object. Sometimes, the rationalization covers up their own sense of helplessness and impotency (&quot;Stop putting women on a pedestal!&quot; &quot;Some people are afraid of the power of these techniques!&quot;) But that covers up the main issue: there&#x27;s a particular shadow side to masculinity, where lust consumes the brain and the person who attracted you stops being a person and becomes an object to fulfill that lust. Further, it is related to another shadow side, that men want to feel that they have power over women and can conquer them. (And likewise, some women know this and exploit this emotional vulnerability).<p>There is some wisdom in the sociopath, in particular, being detached from being consumed by impulses and emotions. Sociopaths though, lack empathy. They lack the ability to feel as others do, and so will do some destructive things.<p>It&#x27;s entirely possible to use the methods from the PUA community with empathy (and perhaps, compassion) ... but you know, in order to do that, you first have to get in touch with your own emotions. Most men tend to be wimpy about going deep within themselves or surrendering to truth and wisdom.",1380909449

PGP-related questions were some of the most common help problems, on /r/SilkRoad, people would regularly mention not encrypting their address (ranked up there with early finalization for being incredibly frustrating for those of us who knew what we were doing), and the Atlantis CEO stated that like 90% of Atlantis users relied on the Atlantis-provided PGP encryption rather than encrypting it themselves.<p>> When people communicated with SR vendors, did they use email (where PGP might matter) or did they use the SR software?<p>SR had an internal message system, much like Reddit&#x27;s PMs. You would copy the public key off the vendor&#x27;s profile page on SR (or possibly from a thread on the forums), you&#x27;d ASCII-armored encrypt your address to the public key, and paste it into an address form field during the order process. You&#x27;d do the same thing for a regular PM.<p>> Did their forum software allow people to sign their posts?<p>Sure: ASCII armor, remember.

Drugs like cocaine, meth, heroin, etc, make you into an addict once you start taking them on a regular bases - and that happens quite easily.&quot;<p>Under the assumption that selling an addictive product is immoral.  Coffee shops must be the work of the devil himself, and it is immoral for a company to provide its employees with free coffee.  Video games are also very addictive, so you have just condemned the entire video game industry.  Social networking is addictive too, so you just condemned social networking (ironically, you may have even condemned <i>Hacker News</i>, the very site on which we are having this discussion).<p>Basically, your standard of morality is beyond extreme.<p>&quot;So a prescribed 5mg Desoxyn (dextro-methamphetamine) pill swallowed once per day for Narcolepsy is no different than the typical 100mg of crystal Meth put and smoked in a pipe to get wired for 24h?&quot;<p>No, but that is because you are describing the difference between <i>use</i> and <i>abuse</i> of a drug, which is not relevant to the question of whether or not drugs should be illegal.  It is also worth pointing out that pharmaceuticals are far less damaging <i>because of the regulations on their production</i> and that one of the biggest problems with black-market methamphetamine is <i>adulterants</i>.<p>Let&#x27;s put it this way:  would you rather have a meth addict get their drugs in regulated dosages and purities, or leave everything up to chance?  When my doctor asks me if, when, and how often I drink alcohol, I can give a meaningful answer <i>because alcohol is legal and regulated</i>.  Why shouldn&#x27;t a meth user be able to do the same?<p>&quot;Or a couple of Vicodin or Percs for pain in you back is no different than shooting black tar heroin?&quot;<p>In fact, pharmaceutical opiates are <i>more</i> habit-forming than heroin, due to their purity and the fact that they are basically <i>engineered</i> to be effective drugs.  That is why people wind up in this situation:<p><a href=""http://www.webmd.com/pain-management/features/prescription-drug-abuse-who-gets-addicted-and-why"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.webmd.com/pain-management/features/prescription-d...</a><p>&quot;The difference in effects between powder-cocaine insufflated and crack-cocaine smoked is so great that it literally feels like a different drug.&quot;<p>Likewise with injecting cocaine, which was once the common way to use the drug, versus drinking coca tea, which was the original way to use the drug.  This is like comparing beer to grain liquor; all you are doing is comparing one form of a drug with another form of the drug.<p>&quot;One of many counter-points to the &quot;it must always be a race thing&quot; argument.&quot;<p>The counterpoint to which is <i>the history of powder cocaine prohibition</i>.  Yes, powder cocaine was once legal in the United States, and then people started saying that black men who used cocaine would become more accurate with a pistol, impossible to stop with a shot through the heart, and prone to rape white women.  Don&#x27;t believe me?  Here is a New York Times article from the early 20th century:<p><a href=""http://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive-free/pdf?res=F60B14F7345F13738DDDA10894DA405B848DF1D3"" rel=""nofollow"">http://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive-free/pdf?res=F60B14F734...</a><p>(&quot;Negro Cocaine &#x27;Fiends&#x27; Are A New Southern Menace&quot;)<p>It is not just cocaine.  Marijuana was make illegal under equally questionable premises:  claims that it fueled black Jazz musicians, claims that it caused white women to want to have sex with black men, claims that Mexican vagrants were using it to corrupt the white youth, and so forth.  Heroin was made illegal to punish the German company Bayer, and people were told that opiates in general were part of the bad habits of Philipinos and other Asian immigrants.  You can look at the <i>Congressional Record</i> and see the <i>overt</i> racism that surrounded the early debates about drug prohibition, <i>debates that we have never revisited</i>.<p>When you look at the history of drug prohibition you will find racism and hand-outs to corporations.  That is because drug prohibition is and has always been about racism and corporate greed, never about public health (unless you care about the propaganda used to support it).  While people were (and continue to be) told racist nonsense to justify drug prohibition, corporations that benefit from said prohibition have lobbied hard in favor of it.  It should come as no surprise that tobacco, alcohol, and pharmaceutical companies are big contributors to &quot;The Partnership for a Drug-Free America&quot; -- they have enjoyed inflated profits as a result (the irony of a tobacco company pushing a message about the deadly consequences of marijuana or methamphetamine is off the scale).",1380909237

Banning drugs and thus enabling a black market in them means that people like that have a way to make money and create organizations dedicated to enforcing their will. Yeah, if we legalize drugs, they&#x27;ll try to switch to something else to maintain their gangs and lifestyle, but nothing is as profitable as drugs, so there will be much less money available to such organizations, and they&#x27;ll all either shrink dramatically or fall apart entirely.<p>It&#x27;s also about how money influences people. Some people are irredeemably criminal/violent, but I think they&#x27;re a minority. Most of the people in the market are probably following the money. They&#x27;re doing it to make money, and they&#x27;ll use violence if needed to preserve their market, but they probably don&#x27;t have any desire in general to hurt people. Take away the need for violence by making it legal, and thus delegating violence to the police, and they&#x27;d probably be perfectly happy to be relatively normal businessmen.<p>Then again, maybe they&#x27;ll just get involved in the Government instead :-/",1380908990

Children with ADHD have problems with inattention, distractibility, disorganization, impulsiveness, and overactivity. This study found that sunny regions with high solar intensity, such as the US states of California, Arizona, and Colorado, and countries like Spain and Mexico have lower prevalence of ADHD. An apparent protective effect of sunlight accounted for 34-57% of the variance in ADHD prevalence. The authors speculate that this may be related to sunlights effects on preventing circadian rhythm (biological clock) disturbances.

Reverse that statement and you&#x27;ve got my position. It&#x27;s very difficult for an average voter to figure out where the cash for his tax cut is coming from, but it&#x27;s crystal clear approximately how much disposable income they will personally benefit from it even if the indirect consequences are pretty hazy. It&#x27;s up to the government to figure out how to pay for it, and to balance that out against the desires of people that are really far more concerned about murder rates, welfare cuts or national debt rises.<p>By contrast this system asks voters to become technocrats and carefully predict the set of variable weightings that will allow the investors to pass legislation that reduces their taxes; that is if Big Capital doesn&#x27;t decide to bet on a policy proposal that uses the freed-up budget to reduce <i>their</i> taxes instead. Frankly, if an average voter can&#x27;t determine if they want the candidate that offers them lower taxes instead of the one that offers them better policing, they&#x27;re certainly not capable of choosing between the two candidates&#x27; proposed set of HDI weightings and calculation methodologies. Nor does anything in the proposed mechanism stop policy proponents sneakily attaching undesirable policies to desirable ones: in this case if you offered the banking system bailouts they&#x27;d probably bet big enough on the bill to allow it to pass even if it had subsidiary clauses mandating the execution of firefighters&#x27; firstborn.

Bear with me, I bore with you: Imagine that the story was of a sadistic straight rapist. The almost-victim must be completely uninterested in sex; if you cannot imagine such a level of purity, imagine a lesbian. Now imagine that someone comments on the survival story of this kind that she wrote using words like &quot;wonderful&quot;. Is that a normal reaction?

That is, sending something through the tor network means that it&#x27;s more likely that your traffic is going through a node belonging to a group that records everything than if your traffic randomly found a point to point route across the internet.<p>I don&#x27;t see how using the Tor network could make you <i>less</i> anonymous, unless as you point out, it&#x27;s use suggests a user&#x27;s greater likelihood of sending and receiving interesting information.<p>It hurts the system that exit nodes have been targeted for content that other users were responsible, but from how I have read, Tor can provide people meaningful anonymity that is difficult breach.<p>As an aside: What is the effect of such parenthetical statements? I think they just create a vague idea of uncertainty and fear. If there is a vulnerability, there has to be a mechanism, not just a sense of omnipotent government surveillance.<p>Maybe that mechanism is the probabilistic likelihood of an organization controlling a large portion of the Tor nodes&#x27; ability to identify users. Maybe it&#x27;s a flaw that has been surreptitiously put into the source code. I&#x27;m pretty sure more people who know would suspect the former as far more likely than the latter.

I&#x27;ve tried melatonin, but it is no substitute for for filtering blue light in my experience, and it tends to induce horrific, apocalyptic nightmares (granted, a night dreaming of EAS Emergency Action Notifications is better than no sleep at all).<p>I used to be an owl for years--decades. A regular 9-5 schedule seemed out of reach. All previous attempts quickly led to backsliding and accusations of moral failure. However, I found that an involuntary physiological response to artificial light in the range 460-484nm was involved.<p>This May I changed my environment by filtering out blue light after 8PM, turning off white lamps and turing on amber compact fluorescents. I&#x27;m asleep ~ 10PM and up usually ~ 5AM. This is now my regular schedule. It would have been inconceivable for me six months ago.<p>I use the following:<p>1. Inexpensive Uvex amber goggles from Amazon: <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Uvex-S0360X-Ultra-spec-SCT-Orange-Anti-Fog/dp/B003OBZ64M/ref=sr_1_2?s=hi&ie=UTF8&qid=1379337848&sr=1-2&keywords=uvex+amber+glasses"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Uvex-S0360X-Ultra-spec-SCT-Orange-Anti...</a> Wear them at least an hour or two before bedtime. I also have the considerably more expensive glasses from lowbluelights.com. In my experience, the inexpensive goggles work just as well, although the more expensive glasses filter more blue light.<p>2. I replaced most of the white compact fluorescent lights in my apartment with amber compact fluorescent lights <a href=""https://www.lowbluelights.com/index.asp"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.lowbluelights.com/index.asp</a><p>3.

Sometimes I forget to set the clock--now I don&#x27;t seem to need it.<p>Not to mention f.lux (pardon the paralipsis), though again, in my experience, filtering is necessary.<p>Concerning the scientific basis for the claim that blue light in the range 460-484nm suppresses melatonin production, here is one reference: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photosensitive_ganglion_cell"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photosensitive_ganglion_cell</a><p>Moral: Nagging and moralizing was both uninformative and ineffective.

They supplied finished, working solutions, which were really &quot;just&quot; high-quality versions of what the other guys did.  Eventually, services got so widespread (Lintel) that customers got less picky and Sun&#x27;s peculiar quality didn&#x27;t matter anymore.<p>However, that won&#x27;t be how Apple will die out (if they do...), because there is already a huge market of people with lesser quality standards than Apple (Android).  Instead, Apple&#x27;s threat is another company who takes the time to give extraordinary quality for novice users.  This isn&#x27;t happening right now, b/c everyone is fighting for the disruptive (low) end of the market.<p>So, Sun could have extended their business by diversifying to serve specific high-volume customer markets.  Java was an epic half-step.  They gave away their ability to add value to customers for nearly free, while focusing ever harder on custom unix hardware and software (UltraSPARC!).<p>If Apple wants to avoid a Sun-like fate, they&#x27;ll need to properly diversify beyond custom hw and sw and extend into the spaces of large customers where they can add value.  You see _some_ of this in their supporting multimedia Bitflingers, but they&#x27;ll need to incur much deeper and much more specifically into the multimedia and small office spaces.<p>Perhaps the Cyanogen corporation could morph into a &quot;luxury&quot; distro?",1380907124

Driving away from their HQ I left thinking how difficult consumer services were going to continue to be for them if they insisted on perfection before release. I still think of this every time I use Dropbox instead of iCloud, Sunrise instead of Calendar, Mailbox instead of Mail and so on. Even when I look at iMessage and wonder why the fastest growing apps are chat-related (dont tell me its just cross platform, I think Apple could have been way more aggressive with evolving and opening iMessage up).</i><p>Hmmm...when I use the aforementioned services, I have the <i>opposite</i> assumption...that Apple is not at all insisting on perfection before release...and is sometimes OK with substandard releases. It&#x27;s the <i>promotion</i> of these services  as being <i>perfect</i> that Apple seems to be better at...or at least readying these services so that in many/most use cases, they <i>seem</i> perfect to the casual end user.<p>But I think developers who have worked with iCloud, for instance, would argue strenuously that iCloud was not released in a robust state.<p>As another anecdotal point...buying an iPod 5 made me realize how perfection is not necessarily Apple&#x27;s goal, even in hardware. The previous iPod touch, and the iPhones, all had ambient light sensors...this was dropped in iPod 5...this seems like a minor feature but only if you don&#x27;t go in and out of buildings during the day. Unless I remember to jack up the brightness on my iPod before going out during the day, I literally will not be able to see <i>anything</i> on the iPod screen, unless I go back inside or the day gets darker. Moreover, switching the brightness has been moved out of the quick-nav and buried in Settings.<p>This is such a massive inconvenience that I can&#x27;t help but think that Apple was on deadline and for some reason, couldn&#x27;t fit in the ambient light sensor, and then said, &quot;fuck it, just ship it&quot;",1380907070

I&#x27;ve listened to quite a bit of his show (although admittedly very little from the past year or so) and he definitely demonstrates good knowledge. Listening to him talk, my impression is that he brings the security mindset[1] to the table, rare among snake-oil peddlers or charlatans.<p>I think one of the main problems is that people <i>in</i> a field are generally critical of people who translate that field to a wide audience. You see that play itself out over and over. And that&#x27;s what Steve does with his show, he tries to explain security to, more or less, laymen. And he only has an audio medium, which adds some difficulty. So, yes, he simplifies some things and this no doubt troubles a lot of security gurus.<p>Of course he&#x27;s made mistakes on the show. I can recall a few, but most of them were caught and corrected later. He doesn&#x27;t script it, so I&#x27;m sure you can find many examples of poor word choices or incorrect acronyms over the 300+ shows he&#x27;s done.<p>I <i>do</i> think he&#x27;s over-played the <i>practical</i> usefulness of some security products that he advertises on the show. I have experience with none of them (to my knowledge), but some of them just sound, to the trained ear, minimally useful. But, sadly, that&#x27;s audio content advertising for you.<p>From the link, we have statements like:<p>> For whatever reason, Gibson tries to explain the Metasploit project as a &quot;malware exploitation framework&quot;<p>OK, that&#x27;s a bad description. But he was describing Metasploit in passing using a description of Metasploit as it pertained to the subject at hand. And, if you read the actual transcript that they linked to, it <i>was</i> being used for malware exploitation. Seems like a silly nit-pick.<p>> You can&#x27;t simply raise the spectre of global spying and hidden rootkits planted by Microsoft without either proving or disproving the allegation<p>No. If you see something alarming, you totally can. He didn&#x27;t panic either.<p>> Steve said SSL connections are not susceptible to man-in-the-middle (MiTM) attacks? This is absolutely false.<p>Please. SSL/TLS has had vulnerabilities that allowed MITM attacks. They&#x27;re ad-hoc and eventually get fixed. You can&#x27;t just expect to MITM a random SSL connection. SSL is designed to be MITM-resistent, and saying &quot;SSL prevents MITM attacks&quot; is not in any way a bad description, especially when you&#x27;re communicating to laymen.<p>> Further, having a switch does not absolutely prevent sniffing traffic. The popular Dsniff tool lets you do this.<p>Yep, he got that wrong.<p>> Close Steve, CSMA stands for Carrier Sense Multiple Access.<p>Yep, he got that acronym wrong. But I decided to check the next show[2]...<p>> [Steve] Also, I mangled an acronym, and I hate when I do that, especially acronyms that I know so well.  I talked about CSMA, and I called it Collision Sense Multiple Access instead of Carrier Sense Multiple Access.  And it has a CD on the end which stands for Collision Detection. [...] So the real acronym for Ethernet is CSMA/CD, which is Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision Detection<p>So he switched a word in an acronym, then corrected it next episode. But they complained anyway. I couldn&#x27;t have scripted it any better to what I said above.<p>Those examples were skimmed from the first three links. The authors came across like they had a vendetta to nit-pick everything they could. They&#x27;ve blown their own credibility already as far as needless nit-picking, missing the forest for the trees, and not checking to see when he corrects his own mistakes (aka, doing their homework).<p>I&#x27;d hardly summarize all that as a &quot;fringe charlatan&quot;. He may be a bit fringe-ish, but I don&#x27;t see how he&#x27;s a charlatan.<p>[1] <a href=""https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2008/03/the_security_mi_1.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2008/03/the_security_...</a><p>[2] <a href=""https://www.grc.com/sn/sn-017.txt"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.grc.com/sn/sn-017.txt</a>",1380906978

I guess the climates of Boston and Stockholm might be roughly comparable, but Boston is actually on the same latitude as Rome).<p>So if you tell an American that something is almost at the Arctic circle, their intuition will tell them it&#x27;s a very rough and almost uninhabited place. You tell it to a Finn, and they&#x27;ll think that it&#x27;s where the fourth largest metropolitan area of the country is, or where you go for a comfortable ski holiday.",1380906167

If so, isn&#x27;t there a moral issue in allowing one person to have for free what another person had to pay for? (Unless you&#x27;re implementing some kind of &quot;pay what you can afford&quot; system.) Isn&#x27;t that theoretically &quot;stealing&quot;? What&#x27;s the solution?<p>> Renting of digital data is a stupid idea to begin with.<p>I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s stupid. I think it allows consumers flexibility; they can pay more and fully own digital content, or they can save money and pay less for temporary access.",1380906161

They are developing the &quot;cyberwarfare&quot; equivalents of weapons of mass destruction. This exploit delivery network goes so far beyond any legitimate purpose it might serve that it belongs in the same moral category as hydrogen bombs.<p>EDIT: The above is somewhat hyperbolic and unclear. The NSA&#x27;s capabilities may have legitimate uses. Similarly, there may be legitimate military uses for nuclear weapons. But building nuclear weapons creates the risk of worldwide nuclear destruction. Similarly, building this kind of highly efficient exploit system creates the risk of destroying all Internet security. The potential destruction far outweighs whatever good the weapons might accomplish. That is why I said they belong in the same category.",1380906111

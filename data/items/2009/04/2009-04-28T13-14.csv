583109,comment,582865,582865,0,0,Hoff,,,"The stack is a great huge implementation detail, and doesn't necessarily work the way you want it to.<p>With porting an operating system across processors or when performing significant changes and upgrades to an operating system and its interfaces, the details of the data and call stack and the thread stacks and register-passing and register spillage and all the other related ugliness can be (and often is) exceedingly platform-specific.<p>Adding applications dependencies on these details means your code can be somewhere between faster and less portable, or faster and non-portable.<p>Or your applications can pin the vendor in a corner by depending on a design statement that the vendor might now regret having made.  Whether that might provide or prevent a thread stack, or changes to the call frames, or stack randomization or otherwise.<p>I'm working in several areas where the vendors spend far, far, far too much time describing the internal details of their implementations.  Which is bad on several levels.  It can pin the vendor to the design; into choosing compatibility or choosing to break applications.  And it tends to obscure the information presented to application programmers with details that are less than relevant.<p>There's more here than strictly performance; there's also compatibility and maintainability, and stability and sustainability, and extensibility.<p>Absent specific reasons and whenever in doubt, the decision should be to present an opaque interface.

583087,comment,581050,582470,0,0,david927,,,"It's a term I made up.  It's actually part of a much bigger, more interesting subject: individual-society ""ology"".  Where the individual comes into contact with the rest of the people around them.  (Where psychology covers individual-individual, and sociology covers society-society relations.)  In other words, when you lie on the leather sofa, you would be asked, ""So how are the people down the street whose name you don't know?""  The people we pass on the street play a huge role in our lives.<p>You see, everyone chooses a strategy around their teens or even into their twenties to say why they are valuable, why they have a right to exist.  A woman might choose: sexy, smart, beautiful, motherly, etc.  And that becomes their identity.  So attacking that (call a smart person ""stupid"" and they'll light up) is attacking their entire identity, what they've chosen as their right to exist.  Have you seen a university professor in a tweed jacket?  There you go.<p>The framesets I mentioned are tied to that identity and defended with that same ""raison d'etre"" fierceness.  Information that violates the frameset, violates the identity strategy.  It's like you have all your money in a particular stock and someone is saying something negative about the company.  The more stake you have in that company, and the more fear you have of it crashing, the more unwilling you will be to be rational about what others may say.<p>Following the analogy, it might seem that diversifying is the answer: you're smart, but also into extreme sports and healthy, etc. That's not really the answer, though.  The trick is to get your money out of the stock market; you have to care as little as possible what people think.  Sound easy?  It's one of the hardest things you can possibly do.",1240926311

People complain of tight schedules that are almost impossible and no time to learn new tech.<p>Also the 6-month maternity leave for women has been reduced to 3 months now. A friend's wife who recently gave birth to a child, was told a strict ""no"", even when she said she would take the 3-month maternity leave and work at home for the another 3-months after which she would get back to her normal work schedule. (she then quit her job).<p>So where does Narayan Murthy's easy-work-schedule for women, ""we support women empowerment"" mean? He recently wrote a guest column on how Infosys supports women and told abt all the facilities they weren't even providing on paper.<p>Also another funny thing, just a couple weeks ago, I read an interview by Nandan Nilekani in which he said that Infosys won't be laying of any of their workforce (article headlined in the newspaper's business page). 3 days later they layoff 2600 and it's in a small column in the newspaper's business page.<p>People should rather look for some stuff from people like Guy Kawasaki, Sam Altman or whoever's done it. I often listen/read abt people who do it for their first time and talk abt their experience and how they did it. Each have their own way of doing it and the business is different and it's fun to know how the other guy did it.<p>[full disclosure: I'm from Bangalore too.

They will give employees one hour less than is required to give them benefits, then ask you to work overtime, they will reduce training from what was traditionally 1 month down to 5 days, they will move the call centre to whatever is cheapest and ultimately they will offshore the centre as much as possible.

5525519,comment,5521453,5521453,2,0,jyu,,,"Early in your career, there is a lot to learn. Being naturally curious and autodidactic seems like a necessary requirement, but having a good mentor can really supercharge how quickly you progress. A good mentor is someone very knowledgeable, hopefully 10x better than you at the things you want to learn, and also has a knack for teaching.<p>I am pretty early in my development career too, but I'd say that the most important thing is making sure you surround yourself with the smartest people that give you the best chance to get to your end goal. If you're interested in learning about TDD, go to a place that does TDD, and connect with people that do TDD. If you're interested in ember, hang out in the ember irc's, ping ember people, and try to build some small ember things out to the point where people can help you.<p>You need to decide your end game first, and then work backwards. As you interview and talk to people, you'll develop a set of deal breakers that conflict with your end game. Interviews are a two way street; you're filtering and interviewing them as much as they are you. If you want to see how current an employer's tech stack is, ask them what they're currently on, and the last things they've upgraded, how painful it was to upgrade. If you think you know more than their lead developer, then it's probably not a good place. Ask them about how their decisions get made, how projects get prioritized. Ask them questions to see how developer happiness plays into their priorities (e.g. I'd like to do some things in X which you guys don't use right now. How could we go about using X in a new project?).<p>There are a few beliefs you have that might be problematic. Programming and tech are tools at the end of the day, and are only one ingredient of many that end up creating a successful company. If you are looking for a tech focused company, look at the headcount breakdown (e.g. 10 people, 1 developer and 9 sales people vs 9 developers and 1 sales person).  Even more troubling, you seem to think your liberal arts degree is a disadvantage, and that a bad interview means you might not have the chops to make it. First and foremost, interviewing is most definitely a skill that improves over time, and bad interviewers ask a lot of things unrelated to the job. Even really bright technical people botch interviews all the time. (<a href=""http://steve-yegge.blogspot.com/2008/03/get-that-job-at-google.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://steve-yegge.blogspot.com/2008/03/get-that-job-at-goog...</a>). Secondly, life is long, and you are hardly defined by some subject you chose to study for 4 years. You live in a time where top notch classes and books and online learning material are readily accessible and cheap or free.<p>From what you've written, sounds like you're looking for a full stack developer position. Apply to a bunch of places, and try to interview at places you don't care about first. Reach out to companies and people that may or may not be hiring to chat with you. Work through CLRS, work through a CS curriculum, pair with people, and put all your assignments up publicly. Then when people question you about your liberal arts degree, you can show them evidence that you have covered a lot of CS topics and have a lot of CS knowledge.",1365605911

Then I had couple late nights when my sleep was in 5 hours bracket and it felt weird how good I feel, how wired I am during the day.

Data is getting pulled off disk, just not in a way that requires multiple copies.<p>How did you get this information? If that's the case, why did they not actually use the values (e.g. do something trivial like compute accumulated XOR or something). That would still show the advantages of the zero-copy design, but not ridiculously so.<p>It still seems highly suspicious. For example the benchmark with 100kb values runs twice as fast as the benchmark with 100 byte values?!<p>I certainly agree that the zero-copy design can be good, but these benchmarks are vastly overstating it to the point that the benchmarks are pretty useless. With these benchmarks it's impossible to know if that database is actually faster than the others. It could well be faster, but it could also be slower. To know that you need a fair comparison.<p>Note also that memory mapped designs have disadvantages as well. For example AFAIK memory mapping doesn't work asynchronously. You will block your threads, so you can't use lightweight threads or callbacks but you'll have to use heavyweight threads (which may limit concurrency and be expensive in general). Unless you implement your own OS of course (which interestingly some people are doing: <a href=""http://www.openmirage.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.openmirage.org/</a>).<p>> So basically you're saying there is no benefit here because you aren't used to systems that effortlessly support it.<p>I'm not saying there is no benefit, I'm saying that it's a bad idea to rely on it that way for 500mb because for it to work safely every component has to support the same.

Men had more economic security because they could work, whereas most women could not. Men have bodily security in ways women do not, esp. in regards to sexual assault and domestic violence.<p>> men had to work or they wouldn't find a women to marry<p>I think you have this backwards. Men didn't have to marry. However, since women at large could not work and support themselves, many had no choice but to be attached to someone who could work. Due to past stigmas about women were not married, this put women in a position where getting married was a near necessity.<p>> Women didn't have to work, as they could be supported by their husband.<p>Not only would women have little recourse but to marry someone, but women by far were expected to should domestic duties. That is a lot of work and is a full time job in and of itself.<p>> Of course, there's little proper scientific research on this subject, as ""women's studies"" start from their assumption that women had and have everything worse without really proving it.<p>This is blatantly not true. There is a ton of written and academic research work on gender, sexism, etc. and women's studies is a real academic discipline.<p>> The problem with saying that the men's gender role of more freedom but more responsibility doesn't take into consideration that some people prefer to have less freedom and less responsibility, while some women prefer to have more freedom and more responsibility and some less freedom and less responsibility (or at least prefered in the past).<p>Men are much more able to pursue the less freedom and less responsibility life, as you put it, compared to women because of how they are treated in society at large. Historically most women did not have the option for the less freedom and less responsible life since they would either be pigeonholed into domestic care or they would have been working poor.<p>> Even if we assume that men had better starting position in the past, that doesn't apply anymore. Young women are outearning and have more success in education.<p>This is plainly not true. Most women still earn less than their male counterparts. Further, women still suffer far more from domestic and sexual violence and have their bodies policed much more than men.<p>> True equality can only be reached through the abolition of gender roles for both men and women, not assuming that men need to ""man up"" and therefore saying that gender inequality is somehow positive and should exist.<p>Gender inequality exists right now, even without something like Lulu, and will continue to exist for the foreseeable future. Having an app that deals with one aspect of that reality is totally legit.<p>> You also made the claim about ""imbalance"". There's no imbalance in favor of women in Western countries.<p>Amazingly you say that there is no real research on women's studies, but then go on to conclude there is not problem at all.<p>> Men have just as much gender equality problems as women, but even speculating this is politically incorrect.<p>Ah yes, saying men have it as hard as women, which is demonstrably not true at a societal level, will summon the PC police.<p>> Here's a study o the subject: <a href=""http://granum.uta.fi/granum/kirjanTiedot.php?tuote_id=18450"" rel=""nofollow"">http://granum.uta.fi/granum/kirjanTiedot.php?tuote_id=18450</a><p>The summary of that study tries to use misandry and matriarchy seriously to describe the social and political condition of a western country.

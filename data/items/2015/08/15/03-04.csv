10064251,comment,10063107,10064222,0,0,tempestn,,,"Kudos for stating a taboo or at least unpopular opinion in a reasoned manner.  I do think that drunk driving should be a crime, because on balance I expect making it so does more good than harm.  There are certainly people who choose not to drive when intoxicated for no other reason than fear of being caught and punished.  That said, I agree with aspects of your point: it should certainly be a greater crime to be swerving around the road while intoxicated than to simply blow slightly over the limit on a breathalyzer with no other symptoms, and while it could already be charged as multiple offenses, I&#x27;m not sure that that&#x27;s often done in practice.  Also, I tend to lean against &quot;zero tolerance&quot; laws, where any BAC whatsoever is a crime.<p>Heck, you could even argue that a particularly good driver and/or someone with a high alcohol tolerance may be safer even when impaired than some drivers are unimpaired; perhaps then the oldschool impairment tests - walk in a line, touch your nose, etc., are fairer than the theoretically more impartial breathalyzer.  I&#x27;m not sure how I feel about that, but it seems like a reasonable argument at least.",1439610934

The idea is to be able to set policies for SMSes which are outbound and guard against potential FCC fines. The challenge is that one side of the communication is over an app and the other side is via generic texting. This is different from WhatsApp and FB Messenger where both parties communicating have the app installed. The main challenge here is to port an existing number to an app. So, if I text a number (XXX-XXX-XXXX), it is routed to the app so the policies can be applied. With Twilio, the app has to be assigned a new virtual number. Is there any service out there that can do this phone # mapping to an existing number? Also, what sort of infrastructure works for implementing use cases where you have generic texting on one side and app based texting on another?

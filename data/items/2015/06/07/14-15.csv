I think they serve a purpose with first time offenders or to secure testimony in cases where there are significantly bigger stakes. But some plea deals are just absolutely absurd and destroy the certainty of punishment. If people knew that there were guaranteed consequences I think we could reduce jail sentences to some extent. Instead we have increased jail sentences because we have increased the plea deals. What used to be a guaranteed 30-day sentence now has turned into 90-days because with the plea deal and good time the person will only serve the original 30 days.",1433689112

I will die with student loan debt and it’s ridiculous.<p>People who don’t understand the cycle of poverty in this country, like to throw around terms like “entitlements” or “self indulgence” or “lazy” and it’s bullshit.  Quit applying your situation to every other situation in existence.  If anyone in this thread is self indulgent, it’s you.<p>Colleges set you up for failure.  They are money making machines who whose main purpose is garnering new students at whatever cost.  Most are not interested in your success (in school).

9674818,comment,9673975,9673975,0,0,soyiuz,,,"I think the author misses the point. As far as I see it, Unix tools are optimized for one thing: the human user. If `ls` is bloated, it is only bloated from the system point of view. As a user, I only see a small command that is quick and consistent (to a reasonable extent) with other tools. I don&#x27;t need to know about 39 flags--that complexity is revealed with time, as I need to accomplish more complex tasks. For now, I only use and &quot;see&quot; two or three. And if more is needed, the program is small enough to be reasonably well documented. `man ls` perhaps with `grep` is all most people need.<p>This brings me to the second point. &quot;Streams of  text.&quot; Just like `ls`, streams of text are an optimal format/convention for humans. Many other things are better at being more compact or more efficient etc. But as formats and conventions proliferate, streams of plain text remain: readable and universal. Humans will ALWAYS be able to work with text. It is something that all humans kind of agreed upon--which cannot be said for any other formats or standards, which can offer various technical benefits at the expense of longevity, universality, and readability.<p>These two features (`ls` being relatively light and text streamy) leads to the &quot;bootstrapping&quot; effects sought after by the first generation of Unix developers. Learning about pipes and filters in one part of the system is applicable to all others. These tools scale with your level of expertise. They grow with you because despite the small quirks, there&#x27;s a remarkable consistency of interface: text! Consequently `ls` (along with many other core tools) is implemented in the same way across a staggering variety of platforms. It has survived decades of alternatives touted as &quot;better,&quot; &quot;faster,&quot; &quot;more usable,&quot; etc. etc. etc. That is the remarkable achievement of *nix / GNU etc. approach to creating human-centric software. As we architect ever more complex systems, we would do well to understand why and how Unix has endured, warts and all.",1433688416

Simply put, so much is played very fast and \nloose.  Fragile systems are sometimes built in haste on fragile foundations.<p>In say, electrical and building codes for houses (not engineering so much, but applicable), there are established standards for protection of consumers and standardization of work.  In software, usually these don&#x27;t exist - or they exist in small legal areas like PCI or HIPAA, and don&#x27;t really explain how the software is built either, but only some of the properties.  Not only do building codes exist, but the similar codes and standards exist for the parts the technicians install.<p>Rather than codify the practices of the craft that firm things up, everybody&#x27;s still trying to figure out what those practices are.  And maybe that&#x27;s ok.  Bridge building has been done for thousands of years, and software has been done for far less than a century.<p>We are still figuring a lot out.  Yet, at the same time, I don&#x27;t think we remember much from history, software that has &quot;nailed it&quot;, and analyze what works and doesn&#x27;t.<p>Software is also kind of not engineering because it&#x27;s an expressive medium to some, kind of an art, hence the application of &quot;craftsmanship&quot; frequently applied.  We are sometimes inventors, sometimes engineers, sometimes sometimes carpenters, sometimes plumbers.<p>These are all valid fields, but I do want for greater engineering rigor over the long haul.  I think it would make things less stressful.  But right now, we (as the people in the industry) are doing all these breadth first forays to figure out how software is built - sometimes getting stuck in local minima and maxima until we can upset an ideology enough to try something new - and that&#x27;s partly why it feels like it does.  We have a lot of people with different experience levels and different specializations, and often conflicting opinions, where sometimes none are clearly right or wrong.<p>On the other end, business also needs to change.  A bridge is never &quot;sold quickly&quot;, it is sold and then takes as long as it takes.  Electronics can be pitched heavily, but the cost of field replacement is so remarkably large it must be gotten right the first time.  However, software can quickly be replaced on the fly.  More so a problem if you are working on a .com than on firmware, the need for rigor is reduced and engineering deliverable is more controllable by the desires of the business side.<p>Ultimately, it&#x27;s still a remarkably new industry, and it itself is able to evolve quickly, as we are not realing dealing with the rules of chemistry, but rather conceptual ideas and logic.

If you asked an engineer who&#x27;s an expert at building bridges to then build a skyscraper, they&#x27;re likely to have estimates that are off-base. Meanwhile in the software world we say we&#x27;re Java developers or Ruby developers or Haskell developers are whatever. The field is only now starting to really mature to the point where we can start categorizing different kinds of software projects and specializing in different practices.",1433685727
9674631,comment,9672370,9673529,0,0,vannevar,,,"These are really good observations. If there&#x27;s a common thread, I would say it&#x27;s the intolerance for failure exhibited by managers who don&#x27;t understand software development. I&#x27;m not sure that intolerance would be lessened by another system, whether it be waterfall or kanban, or ad hoc. Prior to agile, when failure happened, it tended to happen in a big way near the end of the project. But if a project were two or three years long, as is common in software, everyone could move on to other jobs after having spent two or three years without having to report progress every day or demo features every two weeks. A couple years in one job is pretty typical nowadays. So in some ways it was a more comfortable environment for engineers.<p>Agile was introduced so that failure could be amortized and tracked. It makes the development process more transparent so that mid-course management corrections can be made and the corporate ship can be steered around the icebergs instead of running blindly dead into them. But in order for it to work, management must be tolerant of small failures. If it&#x27;s not, then scrum will become theater with failure swept under the rug, and you&#x27;ll be right back where we were, with failure becoming apparent only near product launch, when the iceberg suddenly appears out of the fog too late to avoid it.<p>Now, it may be a valid criticism that agile expects too much from management, that most software company managers aren&#x27;t competent enough to use it. But that pretty much says we&#x27;re all doomed anyway, regardless of what system (if any) is employed.<p>I&#x27;d be interested in your thoughts on why you feel kanban is better, since my impression is that it is essentially the same process but without sprint intervals.",1433685726

It is programatically superior (for scripting) but inferior as a CLI language.

With all its options, `ls` is still just about listing directory contents.<p>And that motto is still just a guideline, not an absolute rule. What makes the *nix shell great is that it follows that motto enough to be sensible and structured, but not enough that it becomes a burden. Just like a human language does.",1433685690

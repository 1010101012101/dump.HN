I wish you luck but I don't see a business model here. Interesting, yes, but how will you make money? I see only a few ways to make money:<p>* Advertising (recruiters being the likely choice)
* Selling your database to recruiters<p>What do you see that I don't see?<p>Good luck though - I hope it works out for you.",1215776383
243425,comment,243202,243202,0,0,underscore,,,"First: congratulations on getting far enough to feel comfortable sharing your work with us.<p>What sort of requirements do you have for email addresses? In help (/help.php) you say that users need an email address, but don't really go into specifics, which is fine. However, one of mine (message me outside the thread if you want specifics, I guess) failed as invalid when I tried to register.<p>The privacy policy (/privacy.php) mentions that users are encouraged to provide a corporate email address and (or?) linkedIn profile for verification. I didn't see any way to provide this when registering, nor do I see any way to provide this when I go to write a review. If you require this later (e.g., after I attempt to submit my review), it might be nice to say so somewhere. If not, it might be nice to remove that line from the privacy policy, at least until you add that bit of functionality, as it seems a trifle confusing, at least to me.<p>You're probably planning this already, but some sort of information on the number of reviews for a company in your company list would be nice (or a way to filter out companies that don't have any reviews).<p>Do you plan on encouraging users to give an overall rating in some easily displayed/read format for their employer (e.g.: the stars of coderific)? Most of the content, of course, is in the text, but I find myself missing the summary stars/number when skimming.",1215776255

I don't care if I have to use IE - I'm fine with that - and I use Windows 2008. I've saved this thread hoping that someone will come up with good suggestions :)",1215776091

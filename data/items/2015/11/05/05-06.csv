10511847,comment,10505299,10511004,0,0,Steuard,,,"Thanks for writing this. There&#x27;s a lot to think about here, but just for starters, your very first paragraph finally helped me to understand what failure of clarity on my part led to the hostility that we&#x27;ve been going back and forth with this whole time. So in the interest of improving that clarity, let me try to rephrase my original comment about crackpots to do a better job of conveying what I intended:<p>-----\nIf your mental model of &quot;the set of people who publicly discuss science&quot; doesn&#x27;t include &quot;There exist a whole lot of crackpots out there&quot;, your mental model of scientific discourse in our society is wrong. The odds of radical new ideas being crackpottery are far greater than the odds that some unappreciated genius has upended the well-tested laws of physics.\n-----<p>I&#x27;m not sure whether it was carelessness or generosity that led me to use the term &quot;the scientific community&quot; in a way that included those working at (or beyond) the far fringe of respectability. On reflection, I think that I&#x27;ve done them that courtesy before; I&#x27;m often careful to specify a label like &quot;mainstream&quot; when I intend a more narrow definition of &quot;the mainstream scientific community&quot;. My comment &quot;Believe me. I get their emails.&quot; was very much meant to refer to the non-mainstream theories that folks out there seem to regularly send to active physicists in any related field (not as a backhanded slap at the handful of professional peers and colleagues who occasionally write to me). So from my perspective, I haven&#x27;t made any shifts in intended meaning over the course of this conversation that would merit your signposts, but I can definitely see how my words could have given the other impression. (And now you get to judge whether I&#x27;m piling lies upon lies in a scramble to retract a broad insult to my peers, or whether I&#x27;ve been expressing a consistent belief system this whole time. Darned if I know any way to make that judgement easy for you.)<p>As for your broader points: One of the things that troubles me in the discourse between professional scientists and the public is that it&#x27;s painfully common for us to wind up disappointing the very people who are the most fervent supporters of what we do. This is no doubt a reflection of your UR-FACT. A scientist who gets gleefully excited about an unexpected discovery or a strikingly elegant theoretical model is still constantly aware of the tentative nature of science: her enthusiasm is a measure of how rare even the possibility of transformative progress can be. But when that enthusiasm spills over to the public at large (by whatever channels), most listeners don&#x27;t have the training and experience to recognize just how tentative the underlying idea inevitably still is. So when, nine times out of ten, the early promise of the discovery either fizzles or gets mired in technical details with no clear end in sight, the science enthusiasts in the public wind up feeling betrayed. (Even mundane things like the seemingly constant flip-flopping of nutrition warnings is a part of this.)<p>I don&#x27;t know how to fix this. As you say, it may be truly impossible, though I&#x27;d like to think that better early and ongoing education about the process and nature of science could help a little. But I think that&#x27;s what is behind my attempts to dial back the enthusiasm I see for this EM Drive work. What they&#x27;re claiming is something that so many of us long to be true! (I certainly wish it were, both for the thrill of the new physics to explore and for its impact on the future of humanity.) But this isn&#x27;t even a case where justified scientific enthusiasm has wound up being oversold to the public: the science here is just wrong, and the people directly involved in the work (or at least in publicizing it: <a href=""http://emdrive.com/faq.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://emdrive.com/faq.html</a>) seem to not even know the science well enough to recognize that it&#x27;s wrong (or if you were inclined toward conspiracies, they could be knowingly obfuscating its flaws with technobabble). It&#x27;s a case where it&#x27;s all but <i>certain</i> that a big chunk of the enthusiastic public is getting set up for a fall. This goes beyond the challenges of your UR-FACT: something is clearly <i>wrong</i> in how this piece of science is being communicated to the public.<p>And at that point, if I as an expert see someone selling snake oil (regardless of whether they believe in it themselves), don&#x27;t I have some sort of obligation to warn people not to buy into their so-appealing patter? The human cost here is clearly far less than the &quot;vaccines cause autism&quot; scam turned out to be, but they feel fundamentally similar to me. (As do the &quot;bomb detectors&quot; purchased at great cost by various government agencies in Iraq, as do the &quot;magnetized water&quot; devices that get sold to insufficiently skeptical farmers, as do...) Again, maybe you&#x27;re right and the cost in this case is a drop in the bucket of legitimate research, but isn&#x27;t one big purpose for society in training and supporting experts to ensure that there&#x27;s someone around who can police this sort of thing? (And, more philosophically, isn&#x27;t a big part of society&#x27;s purpose in supporting experts the hope that we&#x27;ll help to uncover and disseminate fragments of Truth, whatever that may mean?)<p>Clearly, we (and especially I, it seems) do a pretty poor job of it, if so, as illustrated today by the perennial popularity of this story. I really don&#x27;t know how I or we can do better (clearly today&#x27;s angle hasn&#x27;t gone over as well as the last one did). Maybe it&#x27;s all some sort of status-driven signalling, as you suggest, and my chatter about the public good is just so much self-deception. There may be value to the recommendation that you&#x27;ve made on that basis. But I&#x27;m not sure that I could live my life (or any life) with that framework as my premise.",1446702696

LXC can be locked down with capabilities, kernel namespaces, cgroups, and allow for quite fine-grained isolation. But the focus of Docker is more on use ability: the equivalent of asking a process to sit in the corner and stare at the wall. It&#x27;s an easy way to get a lot of unruly children to stop interfering with each other, if you have many corners. But they&#x27;re kind-a-sorta still in the same room. Not chained to their desks, not blindfolded.<p>But generally, docker doesn&#x27;t do all that much locking down - if you have the libc/code to do something in a docker container, you can in general do it. The layered fs is mostly like a chroot - it&#x27;s safe as long as the kernel is safe, and then it&#x27;s completely unsafe - if the kernel isn&#x27;t safe. The flip side of this is that if you write a program/daemon that works on regular gnu/linux, it&#x27;ll work (as long as you provide the needed library code) in a docker container. And docker helps focus dependencies, in particular <i>data</i> dependencies (the <i>other</i> tricky part of getting something to run in a chroot - where&#x27;s /etc/shadow? Where&#x27;s /etc/group etc)).<p>I&#x27;m sure we&#x27;ll see Docker move in a stricter direction, as more people are wrapping their minds around isolation -- apart from the running under same kernel, LXC <i>can</i> do more. And we have things like rkt with kvm backend that takes all the hard work put into containers and magically(ish) transplants that to work with minimal vms.<p>Docker did/do(?) one thing: it didn&#x27;t allow you to run Docker in docker (you need/needed to run a &quot;privileged&quot; container for that).<p>I&#x27;m not sure if that was as coherent as what you hoped for, but that&#x27;s sort of what I tried to imply wrt design tradeoff.",1446700739

Maybe I&#x27;ve accepted that a little force is unavoidable or perhaps necessary, but a lot is excessive and bad.<p>> In other words you&#x27;ve perverted the definitions of otherwise very clear words as to make this discussion entirely worthless.<p>One of the problems when discussing such things is that we sometimes make arbitrary definitions, which then determine the outcome we want, without taking into account the actual dynamics. So, if we start with &quot;force is bad&quot;, and believe that it is bad because, say, it restrict freedom, we can&#x27;t then arbitrarily define force to be particular uses of it, but we must define it to be all forms of restricting freedom. And how do we know what restricts freedom, i.e. what constitutes force? We need to study human psychology and sociology as it exists in practice. Otherwise, you have to explain why your definition of force is bad while mine isn&#x27;t.<p>> it was not the reactionary use of violence I was referring to. In theory, I have no problem with the use of violence in reaction to an offense on person or property<p>But whether you view it as reactionary or not depends entirely on your pre-conditioning. If you thought all property was shared to begin with, you&#x27;d view forcefully holding on to some property as your own as very aggressive and very much non-reactionary.<p>Imagine that your son decides to stop letting you into his room. He thinks that his room is actually his, while you know that the room is his only in a limited sense. I don&#x27;t think you&#x27;d view his use of force as a reaction, or your incursion as an offense at all.<p>Similarly, private property could just be a limited form of ownership granted to you by society.<p>> I&#x27;m not sure what your comments on restrictions of freedom have to do with the conversation as I have not called for unbridled &quot;freedom.&quot;<p>Well, when discussing values you have to define them. You implied that you view the use of force as bad, but &quot;no force&quot; isn&#x27;t a value. I assumed you believe it is bad because it restricts freedom. If you have other reasons to exclude force, please state them and explain why they only apply to your definition of force.",1446700706

(Git-related mental carnage has taken its toll on many urbit developers as well, alas.)<p>What you suggest reminds me of Lisp&#x27;s infamous &quot;M-expressions&quot;, but worse, because the lack of reserved words in Hoon is the most immediate tangible <i>benefit</i> of our syntax. We&#x27;re homoiconic, and syntax looks unambiguously like syntax (and is actually extremely regular).<p>It&#x27;s difficult to make the assertion that there really isn&#x27;t much of a learning curve stick in a HN comment, unfortunately - it&#x27;s based on experience learning the system myself, and helping others learn it on talk. It hasn&#x27;t been anything syntax-related that trips up people actually learning the language, certainly - it&#x27;s just something superficial that&#x27;s easy to comment on on websites, as we&#x27;ve all seen around Lisp or Perl or even Python (whitespace-indented blocks).<p>To answer you directly, runes are the tag in the tagged union that is the type of our AST, not any kind of identifier. (Perl would probably let you assign pieces of syntax to identifiers, of course...) For example, if you have the following Hoon:<p><pre><code>  |=  a=@\n  ?~  a\n    ~|  %decrement-underflow  !!\n  =|  b=@\n  |-  ^-  @\n  ?:  =(+(b) a)\n    b\n  $(b +(b))\n</code></pre>\nthe associated AST (a noun of type ++twig) is<p><pre><code>  [ %brts\n    p=[%bark p=%a q=[%axil p=[%atom p=~.]]]\n      q\n    [ %wtsz\n      p=[%.y p=~ q=~[%a]]\n        q\n      [ %sgbr\n          p\n        [ %dtzz\n          p=%tas\n          q=2.663.495.029.034.430.894.880.199.458.246.708.989.383.632.228\n        ]\n        q=[%zpzp ~]\n      ]\n        r\n      [ %tsbr\n        p=[%bark p=%b q=[%axil p=[%atom p=~.]]]\n          q\n        [ %brhp\n            p\n          [ %kthp\n            p=[%axil p=[%atom p=~.]]\n              q\n            [ %wtcl\n              p=[%dtts p=[%dtls p=[%cnzz p=~[%b]]] q=[%cnzz p=~[%a]]]\n              q=[%cnzz p=~[%b]]\n              r=[%cnts p=~[%$] q=~[[p=~[%b] q=[%dtls p=[%cnzz p=~[%b]]]]]]\n            ]\n          ]\n        ]\n      ]\n    ]\n  ]\n</code></pre>\n(To get this, I just ran ++ream, our compiler&#x27;s frontend, on that code sample.) It would be as simple as dropping in an alternate parser there that looked for, e.g., &#x27;if&#x27; rather than &#x27;?:&#x27;, which isn&#x27;t actually hard because our parser combinators are really easy to use. (The actual Hoon parser is very old and due for a cleanup, unfortunately, but conceptually is not very complicated.)<p>I wouldn&#x27;t endorse it myself, but perhaps in the future of the project someone will find it a useful thing to do and do it. It would definitely clash with the language&#x27;s design sensibilities in a way that &quot;use English&quot; doesn&#x27;t clash with Perl&#x27;s - Hoon is somewhat more picky (though, what language isn&#x27;t?).<p>Edit: I completely forgot that I was going to include a hypothetical version of the above with keywords. Here:<p><pre><code>  defgate  a=@\n  nil?  a\n    error  %decrement-underflow\n  dim  b=@\n  runtrap  cast-to  @\n  if  inc(b) == a\n    b\n  replace b with inc(b) in this\n</code></pre>\n(The keywords are silly, but please imagine better ones.)",1446700147

The root cause is basically what Matt&#x27;s post points toward: our userbase exploded. Our investment in support didn&#x27;t even come close to keeping up. Long-term, it&#x27;s critical that our support is not just adequate but excellent, and as a result fixing it has been one of our top priorities.<p>Our support is actually quite fast these days; we completely answer most questions in under 3 hours now. We just launched our chat beta for account questions this week, so you can ask urgent questions without figuring out IRC or hopping over to email, and we&#x27;re experimenting with things like phone support and help right inside your dashboard.<p>We&#x27;re going to keep working on this. Feel free to email me at michael@stripe.com if you&#x27;ve any follow up questions.",1446699714

10511706,comment,10508935,10511453,0,0,urbit,,,"I want to stick to ordinary American high-school math as I remember it.  I learned &quot;domain&quot; and &quot;range&quot; in high school.  I don&#x27;t know anyone who defines these terms as something different.  When I hear &quot;projection&quot; I actually don&#x27;t think of set theory, I think of linear algebra, affine transformations, etc.  If it would confuse me, I can hardly confuse others.<p>The distinction between a tree and a DAG is always a matter of interpretation.  From the programmer&#x27;s perspective, a noun is a tree.  From the machine&#x27;s perspective it&#x27;s a DAG, because we share pointers and use reference counts.  Either perspective can be misleading if you&#x27;re expecting to think in terms of the other.  If I saw the three-sentence definition of a noun, I&#x27;d assume it was acyclic, but others as we&#x27;ve seen above would assume it was cyclic.  This stuff is hard.<p>The probable future of this text is that we release all the chapters pretty much as they&#x27;re written, then edit it and turn it into a book.",1446699673
10511705,comment,10510512,10510512,0,0,devereaux,,,"Here is a simple usecase: I would like to use fastmail for their mail offer on my own domain, but not for their calendar and contacts. I need something to keep my google calendar and contacts in sync with icloud calendar and contacts, with bonus points if it keeps that in sync too with outlook calendars and contact. (By keeping in contact I mean 2 way sync)<p>I haven&#x27;t seen such a product yet. What I would like is to have this mix of fastmail + the calendar and contacts gmail accounts on ,y desktop computer, and another mix of fastmail plus the icloud contacts and calendar accounts on my ipad and have both synchronize their data. Fastmail makes sense because it&#x27;s better, but the contacts/calendar offering not so. Icloud has great sync features (push etc) for apple hardware, gmail for android, and it&#x27;s a pain when you don&#x27;t move fully to an ecosystem or another.<p>The closest thing I&#x27;ve seen is Nuevasync to add Exchange Activesync to regular gmail accounts, but I&#x27;d prefer leaving icloud sync in its own way on the ipad.",1446699644

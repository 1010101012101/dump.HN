OOP is a tool that allows to encapsulate some data and logic that go together. Functional programming doesn&#x27;t allow you much more than that.

8873674,comment,8873225,8873381,0,0,chriswarbo,,,"From my understanding, the author was complaining about the way default arguments mess up implementations of currying. If default arguments were included in the .length, then all existing currying implementations would carry on working with no modifications, they would just ignore the default values and require that we pass in values explicitly.<p>Let&#x27;s say we have these functions:<p><pre><code>    function getElem(arr, index=0) { return arr[index]; }\n    var curried = curry(getElem);\n</code></pre>\nIn a hypothetical world where default arguments <i>are</i> included in the length, we would have to supply them explicitly. That&#x27;s no big deal though, it&#x27;s just a potential inconvenience:<p><pre><code>    // Hypothetical, &quot;better&quot; semantics\n    var arr = [&quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;, &quot;c&quot;];\n    console.log(curried(arr));     // partially-applied function, *not* &quot;a&quot;\n    console.log(curried(arr, 0));  // &quot;a&quot;\n    console.log(curried(arr, 1));  // &quot;b&quot;\n</code></pre>\nThe ES6 semantics is worse because we <i>cannot</i> provide a non-default argument to a curried function:<p><pre><code>    // Actual, &quot;worse&quot; semantics\n    console.log(curried(arr));     // &quot;a&quot;\n    console.log(curried(arr, 0));  // Error: attempts to run `&quot;a&quot;(0)`, but &quot;a&quot; is not a function\n    console.log(curried(arr, 1));  // Error: attempts to run `&quot;a&quot;(1)`, but &quot;a&quot; is not a function\n</code></pre>\nThe reason this is particularly unfortunate is that one major use-case of currying is <i>to provide default arguments</i>! In other words, by adding default arguments to the language in this way, ES6 is breaking an <i>existing</i> mechanism for default arguments!<p>I would argue that currying is actually more general than default arguments, so if it&#x27;s a choice between one or the other, they should have added currying to the language instead of default arguments.<p>They&#x27;re not quite comparable, but you can think of currying as supplying default arguments &quot;dynamically&quot; (at the call site), whereas regular default arguments are supplied &quot;statically&quot; (at the definition site). For example:<p><pre><code>    // Give &quot;y&quot; a default value for everyone\n    var defaultMultiply = function (x, y=2) { return x * y; };\n\n    console.log(defaultMultiply(5, 7));  // 35\n    console.log(defaultMultiply(5));     // 10\n\n    // Don&#x27;t commit to any defaults yet\n    var curryMultiply = curry(function(x, y) { return x * y; });\n\n    console.log(curryMultiply(5, 7));  // 35\n\n    // Give &quot;x&quot; a default value, to act like defaultMultiply\n    var double = curryMultiply(2);\n\n    console.log(double(5));  // 10\n\n    // Give &quot;x&quot; a different default, which we can&#x27;t do with defaultMultiply\n    var triple = curryMultiply(3);\n    console.log(triple(5));  // 15\n</code></pre>\nI&#x27;ve implemented and used currying in JS, PHP and Python, and I found JS the most pleasant, specifically because it didn&#x27;t have default values.",1421068216

If you feel uncomfortable communicating in Chinese I can completely understand that (I spend a year in China without many previous Chinese skills) but it&#x27;s not a huge problem if it just happens here and there.

As a linguist, to me syntactic information is tree structures, syntactic categories, etc., and semantics is formulas in some (typically higher-order) logic. But for a lot of the NLP that I see, &quot;syntax&quot; is pretty shallow stuff like head words and POS tag contexts, and &quot;semantics&quot; is at best things like word vectors maybe dependency trees. These are very different. But maybe we&#x27;re thinking of different things! :)",1421067749

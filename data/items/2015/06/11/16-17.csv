We’ve implemented the per write request consistency levels and hinted handoff, ensuring that server reboots and short outages are quickly recovered from and consistency is restored.<p>What’s missing are anti-entropy, distributed queries, joining new servers to a cluster, and tools for replacing servers in a cluster. We’ll start development on some of these features in the 0.9.1 release cycle and more in the 0.9.2 cycle. They will be merged into releases once they’re stable and tested.&quot;",1434041982

9700816,comment,9695102,9696885,0,0,geebee,,,"Yes, that is true.  Memorization doesn&#x27;t necessarily mean rote memorization - for me at least, the algorithms are too complex to memorize by rote, I have to understand them to &quot;memorize them&quot;.  But yeah, if you are able to implement certain data structures and algorithms &quot;in your sleep&quot;, then this does imply, as you said, a kind of memorization.<p>I didn&#x27;t get past the technical interview at google or amazon, so you might want to take advice from someone else, but here&#x27;s what I think I&#x27;d need to pass the algorithm section of the technical entrance exam at google.<p>You must be able to do the following in about 5 minutes or less at a whiteboard with no errors:<p>1) print all permutations of a set\n2) build and print a binary tree (preorder, postorder).  \n3) create a hashing function\n4) quicksort and mergesort<p>(I&#x27;m leaving out linked lists, arrays, stacks and so forth because you won&#x27;t be able to do 2 or 3 without them anyway).<p>The reason you need to memorize these (yes, I&#x27;ll go ahead and use your word now, I agree with you that this is memorization) is that you can&#x27;t be dealing with how to implement these if you&#x27;re going to do enough in 45 minutes to pass the exam.  I think that these three things form the foundation for most variants on recursion, sorting, traversal, combinatorics, and so forth.<p>Next, you need to be able to identify when something is a variant of these algorithms and solve it very quickly at the whiteboard.  &quot;Cracking the coding interview&quot; is good practice for this, but in this case, I don&#x27;t think &quot;memorizing&quot; these questions and answers would be especially helpful, because you&#x27;re unlikely to get that exact question.<p>Here are a few of questions I&#x27;ve invented on the spot (not from my interview, not from cracking the coding interview) that you&#x27;d probably want to get close to solving in 45 minutes or so.  In other words, if a buddy wanted to apply to a top tech company and asked me to give him some practice, I&#x27;d give him 45 minutes at a whiteboard for each of the following questions.<p>&quot;In a binary tree with positive and negative integers, find and print all paths with a positive sum.  Now assume the tree is ordered, and make your code more efficient.&quot;<p>&quot;In an nxm matrix, find all sub square matrices with a positive determinant.&quot;<p>This might just be me, but I was kind of struck with just how much progress and accuracy you are expected to achieve at the whiteboard.  And like I said, I am kind of blown away that people are able to do this.  While I can pose those questions and develop a mental model for how to approach it, I just couldn&#x27;t solve them at a whiteboard in 45 minutes to anything approaching what I believe is the standard.<p>Again, whether this is a good way to filter people out isn&#x27;t something I&#x27;m discussing here, this is just my advice if you are planning to apply and want to be prepped.  Also, there will be more than just data structures and algorithms on the exam.",1434041563

As to how effective they can be, it all depends on how the org is structured. If it&#x27;s a product-centric organization (i.e. P&L rolls up under product and operating costs are charged back to the product org) then it can work pretty well. If it&#x27;s a functional organization (revenue rolls up through a sales org on a regional basis and is combined with costs at the corporate level) then there&#x27;s really no amount of management that will make it a good place for developers to work -- under the latter model, finance is running the company and you&#x27;re a pure cost center. The manager&#x27;s primary focus will be cost control, not product quality. That&#x27;s a bad situation to work under.<p>I agree with your second assessment, but it&#x27;s more of an issue with the consultoware business model than anything. Most consultoware shops start up thinking they&#x27;re going to get hockey-stick growth, but it turns out every implementation is super-custom and it ends up as a consulting business. Many companies fail to realize this has happened, and end up operating like a software company when they should be operating like a professional services company with hourly billing. Under a professional services model, if a customer wants a feature, you can quote them a price for developing and implementing it. Tech debt gets dealt with because it becomes a bottleneck for revenue growth when you can&#x27;t charge clients to add functionality.",1434041406

These folks have very little faith in the police and for good reason. The understanding that police are there to protect rich white people from poor black and Hispanic people has gotten less overt and less official since the 1960&#x27;s, but it&#x27;s still there to a degree, especially in the widespread practice of focusing resources on keeping violence in poor minority neighborhoods from spilling into higher income white neighborhoods.[1] And in any case historical practice has wiped out any trust that might exist between those communities and the police.<p>Here is the real question: how do you do community policing in the low-income black neighborhoods of Baltimore? How do you rebuild trust?<p>[1] As well as the practice of ignoring the deaths of gang members. Maybe they got themselves into their predicament, but you&#x27;re not going to build trust among their friends and family by treating their deaths as inconsequential, especially given the prevalence of gang membership along a wide spectrum of involvement.",1434041022

The concept is that a police service is ineffective if they do not have the broad support of the local community, and the police service should adapt to service the community they have (not the community they&#x27;d want to have).<p>If a bunch of gangbangers &quot;hate&quot; cops then that&#x27;s fine. But when the good law abiding citizens within a community lose faith in the police service, then that police service becomes ineffective since the community won&#x27;t help with the police&#x27;s core mission. Or to phase it another way, the police are an arm of the community, they aren&#x27;t a law upon themselves (in the figurative sense).<p>A lot of other countries do this, and it works well.<p>It is a completely different mindset. All law abiding citizens are now allies in this &quot;war&quot; rather than potential law breakers. You actually have police respond to legitimate community concerns rather than trivial things only the police care about (e.g. DUIs might be a big community concern as opposed to prostitution stings).<p>Honestly the first thing the US absolutely needs is citizen oversight of police (and police complaints).

Furthermore computing the step is extremely fast: you&#x27;re just doing a handful of min()&#x27;s. Even a single cache miss is going to completely dominate that, let alone a disk seek. What matters is that you don&#x27;t scan a 10 million word index, instead you want to prune your search to hit, say, 50 words in the index.<p>That&#x27;s just the step() approach. After that I described how to build the DFA, which gets you the same optimal linear time that you want which does not depend on the query string size.<p>Reply to other comment:<p>> Your DFA construction, while a bit incomplete (you don&#x27;t say how you do the transitions), achieves roughly the same thing as Levenshtein automata do. But you spend significantly more time to construct it. The point of the original paper was not to show that DFAs can be used to compute Levenshtein distance, but to show how to do it quickly and efficiently.<p>Why is it incomplete? You just follow the step() automaton and construct a DFA that does the same. Every time you hit a new state you create a new node in the DFA, and if you hit an old state you just point to a previously constructed DFA node. You can even do the DFA construction lazily.<p>> But you didn&#x27;t implement Levenshtein automata.<p>A Levenshtein automaton for a word W is a finite state automaton that accepts all words V within edit distance n from W. That&#x27;s exactly what I built. The point here is that you turn a 30 second search over the whole index into a 0.02 second search by pruning. If you can then optimize that to 0.015 by making the automaton more efficient that&#x27;s nice but you can hardly claim that what I did is not a Levenshtein automaton because it&#x27;s a bit slower (and it&#x27;s not even clear to me that it would be slower).",1434039786

(www.3D-Avatar-Store.com)  However, we&#x27;ve been unable to raise the financing to build a commercial, scaled infrastructure for video as input. So we built our current infrastructure for single and multiple photo input. It&#x27;s available now, as a web app and webAPI.<p>Our solution differs from this effort, as we use a neural net pipeline for multiple stages of the pipeline: a face finder, a facial feature finder, a 3D reconstruction &#x27;net, and then conventional C/C++ utilities to generate a rigged and ready for immediate use geometry and texture. A nice aspect of using neural nets is the ability to retrain our output &#x27;net to generate any geometry one wants. We currently generate 5 different types of avatars, with our most popular being a Fuse 1.3 compatible character that plugs right into the Mixamo auto-rigging pipeline.<p>Our system is trained on a data set of 300,000 laser scans of real people, plus dozens of photos taken at the time of scanning with each photo capturing a different angle, lighting condition, and type of camera lens.<p>A single photo does a remarkably good job. A single photo only take 0.5 seconds to reconstruct the initial geometry; for an online user the process is 3 to 8 minutes, depending upon prior experience, to create a fairly realistic full body Fuse 1.3 compatible character. We provide multiple editing interfaces, as users tend to provide a &quot;selfie&quot; (with bad perspective distortion) or a poorly lit mobile phone / web cam photo (with splotchy pixels). The multiple editing interfaces provide means of correcting the facial feature locations, and 3D deformations to correct for perspective distortion and difficult to recover features from a passport style image, such as the curve of one&#x27;s profile.<p>We&#x27;ve love to find a financial partner interested in developing our video input capabilities. The video-as-input &#x27;net has higher CPU requirements than the photo-as-input &#x27;net. It&#x27;s results are remarkable: it tracks 36 faces simultaneously per video feed, and can accept up to 4 HD video feeds. Each tracked face is reconstructed in real time, 25 ms per face, holding whatever facial expression the subject had at that moment.<p>No doubt, this paper is a great step forward. 3D Avatars are also a very tough market to crack, as people submit remarkable poor quality images, and you are messing with people&#x27;s visual identity. With actual photos people will say &quot;that does not look like me&quot;, and that self identification issue is compounded with 3D Avatars. Plus, people want them for free, and they are one of the most expensive digital objects to create.",1434039233

I was a provider of paid, private alternatives to ad-driven services. There were tons of us in late 90&#x27;s and many in early 2000&#x27;s. Almost all that didn&#x27;t switch to ads went bankrupt. Customers seemed to universally want more content/service/everything... for free (or near-free)... while being OK with being spied on & sold out. They also got what they asked for: more articles, games, search, socializing, videos, and so on than have existed in all of history. Huge benefits willingly obtained by giving up privacy and control to anonymous, greedy organizations at a cost they didn&#x27;t [and mostly still don&#x27;t] care to think about.<p>Apple, on the other hand, was fine with lying to customers about security (&quot;immune to malware!&quot;), building leaky clouds, suing those that put Mac OS on cheaper hardware, locking in users with software toolchain choices, keeping low income users out due to high prices, discriminating against competitors in App Store, and even charging for updates. <i>On top of that</i>, despite tens of billions in profit, they <i>also</i> sold customers out to advertisers. They are one of the least trustworthy companies in existence for privacy-conscious individuals.<p>So, Tim Cook is full of shit. Apple has enough profit to build inherently private/secure OS&#x27;s, toolchains, and services. This is obvious given that small to midsized firms with a tiny fraction of the money have outdone Apple in many areas of privacy and security by simply putting in effort. Most likely, Tim Cook is merely doing P.R. work to position Apple&#x27;s <i>image</i> (not reality) as more trustworthy compared to ad-driven services. Those services can&#x27;t do this because they&#x27;d go bankrupt by not invading privacy.<p>So, let&#x27;s rehash. Users have more cool and useful stuff than ever before due to ad-driven model. Users got there by repeatedly choosing to be spied on instead of paying or investing time in a private alternative. Apple&#x27;s past and current track record on privacy/security are terrible. They also do advertising, although not dependent like competition. Apple&#x27;s CEO says they believe in privacy/security despite them hardly practicing it. Conclusion: our situation is the from users&#x27; demand, their massive use of such services maintains our situation, a niche want private alternatives, and Apple is doing PR to make money off those people (while still selling them out).<p>Capitalism in action! ;)",1434039039

9700483,comment,9698404,9699644,0,0,adamtj,,,"This might be one of those situations where the simplest and cheapest way to figure out if something will work for you is to just try it for a bit.  You can always stop, but right now you&#x27;re at risk of data loss.  Perfect is the enemy of good, worse is better, etc.<p>Consider: Your current approach is basically to model the problem, evaluate the model, and then decide whether to use the service.  That approach seems to protect you from risk, but it really doesn&#x27;t.  As you&#x27;ve noted, there isn&#x27;t an existing model, which makes the modeling-first approach too expensive.  As a result, you don&#x27;t have backups, which is riskier that one or two months of abnormally expensive tarsnap service.<p>Your deciding factor is probably the long-term cost.  You can ballpark that by paying only a month or two and extrapolating.  That should relatively cheap in absolute terms.  Most numbers are not outliers, so you&#x27;re unlikely to be very surprised.  You would probably know already if you&#x27;re atypical in some way.  Even if it turns out you&#x27;d have an abnormally high cost, figuring that out by evaluating the service will be cheaper that building a model.<p>Perhaps you&#x27;re worried that the costs are fine right now but will grow too high over time.  If so, that&#x27;ll happen relatively slowly, over the course of a month or two at the fastest.  At worst, you&#x27;ll have to delete some backups or switch to a difference service.  That might be annoying, but it won&#x27;t be overly expensive and it&#x27;s unlikely to even happen.  If it does, at least you will have had affordable backups in the meantime.  Right now, you&#x27;re at risk.",1434038598

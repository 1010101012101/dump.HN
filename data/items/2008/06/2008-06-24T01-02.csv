225830,comment,224718,225826,0,0,pg,,,"One thing I tried (released yesterday) is more aggressive graying out of negative comments, in the hope that people wouldn't be so prone to downvote something they could no longer read.  I also increased the threshold for downarrows to appear.  Neither of those helped in this case, though.<p>So for now it's back to the drawing board-- or rather, vi.  I'll write some code to analyze voting patterns and see if there is some way sw could distinguish mean downvoting from e.g. the downvoting of trolls and spammers.",1214272607

My first choice of company was MicroProse, as they had a big UK office. I wasn't quick enough off the mark with them though, and got the standard ""too high demand"" letter.<p>Then I was in our career room, and found some random business listings book that had a small call-out for Cray Research. I put a letter together, thinking ""there's no way someone as cool as Cray would have spaces,"" and sent it off. A while later I received a response from a manager, who said (paraphrasing) ""nobody's <i>ever</i> asked about this before, we'd love to do it, but we'll have to figure out what you can do."" I was rather pleased :)<p>The UK office was mostly support, so I spent a day and a half with the hardware guys who gave me a tour of ECMWF (<a href=""http://www.ecmwf.int/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ecmwf.int/</a>) - they were an ongoing Cray customer, and always had the fastest hardware available from them - happened to be the C90 at the time, or ""the dustbin"". Then it was off to the software support team, who got my 16-year-old self drunk at the local pub (I doubt they knew my age) while hosting a Spanish sysop who was troubleshooting some benchmark results for his employer. The software guys let me loose on a couple of internal Cray machines ('forest' and 'wind') so I could write some quick C programs to see how they compared to the Sparc 5 on my desk. Finally, I sat on the helpdesk team for a day or two, where I fielded live questions from customers (""sorry, we don't support bounds checking in Fortran in your version of UNICOS, it's a known issue and will remain such"").<p>An amazing week. And yes, I still have the T-shirt ;)",1214269845
225792,comment,225355,225755,0,0,murrayh,,,"> Why would googlebot use a different header to pretend that it is a user in order to recieve a broken page? That would not benefit any party.<p>Well... it would benefit Google (and its users), because they could detect and punish cloaking. How would Google detect cloaking? A clerk examining the two served versions, or automagically comparing the two versions of served content? How smart would their comparing algorithm be? Could it determine that your site was not being deceptive? How would you write such a algorithm (and it better be generic, and difficult to exploit)?<p>Basically, I have no idea what the hell Google does and does not do, but I am scared (and ignorant) enough to always serve search engines <i>exactly</i> what I serve users.",1214269598

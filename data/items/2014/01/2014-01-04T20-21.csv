I would incur a significant time (=money) penalty for converting all my code to use it without a perceived benefit. I would have to get say a 30% speed increase or a 30% code # of lines decrease to get of my butt and start converting to Python 3.<p>I want to in principle, don&#x27;t get me wrong, but I just don&#x27;t have the time and money to do it, especially at the opportunity cost of not doing other product related stuff.<p>> * It&#x27;s slow (excluding pypy)<p>Don&#x27;t agree. Python is good enough for me. Point being &quot;slow&quot; and &quot;fast&quot; are just invitations for flame war without a specific benchmark or use case.<p>> * The C interface sucks (compared to something like Lua) and holds back language progress<p>As other post mentioned, try python cffi. That one is pretty good.<p>> * It can&#x27;t handle multicore well outside of multiprocess hacks (which are sold as &quot;the right way&quot; -- bullshit. Sometimes threads are useful).<p>Meh, this is often parroted. In what I do (network and server io stuff) threads work very well!<p>> * Explicit &quot;self&quot; is stupid and most people hate it. Javascript and Ruby are comparable languages, and neither of them need this while still having the exact same flexibility as python.<p>Completely disagree. This is a terrific feature. I hate implicit hidden defaults and assumptions. All the other langauges have an implicit this/self Python makes it explicit. That is a good thing in my book",1388868990

7012886,comment,7011228,7012834,3,0,corin_,,,"I may well be wrong about historical behaviour, but for at least a few years now (i.e. within my memory) it&#x27;s been the case - but you need to create a new instance, not just a new document. I.e. if you open a specific file, or do anything to start a new document from within excel, it will keep the same instance.<p>It&#x27;s still ridiculous behaviour, and drives me crazy because on a typical day I&#x27;ll have a minimum of 3 spreadsheets open (3 sheets I always need quick access to) and often 10-20, and it can be a real pain in the ass remembering which sheets are in which instance, leading to regularly needing to close a sheet, start a new excel instance, then re-open the sheet in that, whenever I want to look at it side by side to another sheet. And even more annoying, if I&#x27;m opening a sheet that&#x27;s an email attachment, I can&#x27;t just open direct from Outlook, I have to save it locally so I can make sure to open it in the correct instance.<p>There&#x27;s also this weird thing about how it thinks you want to shut down spreadsheets. I always forget which way is which, but sometimes it thinks you want to shut just the active sheet, sometimes it thinks every sheet you have open (in that excel instance). Just checked here and it doesn&#x27;t seem to be the case on my home PC (Office Professional Plus 2010), but it definitely does on my work laptop. I <i>think</i> it&#x27;s different behaviour between the X in the top right, double clicking the top left logo, and using alt+F4, I just can&#x27;t remember which is which. But any logic would say that if you&#x27;re showing multiple windows on the task bar, telling one to close doesn&#x27;t mean close the others, and I think this is essentially tied to the same issue with trying to view sheets side by side.<p>I&#x27;ve never had issues with Word as others mentioned, though - possibly due to luck with versions I&#x27;ve used, or maybe I just don&#x27;t have to compare two word documents side by side as often as I do with spreadsheets.",1388868950

Further, it is not a good example because Windows sucks.<p>* Google doesn&#x27;t employ every smart person ever.<p>* Google can&#x27;t actually compete. (ed note: in any field, or just against iOS and Fb?)<p>* My argument is like the argument that no one would supplant Windows.<p>* Given enough time, everything dies.<p>Points 2 and 3 are about Google. Let&#x27;s start there. You&#x27;re right that Google doesn&#x27;t employ every smart person ever, but then, who said they did? :) But there are a limited number of search relevance engineers, and finding enough to keep up with Google is a monumental, and maybe insurmountable feat. If you want to compete with Google, you will need to have a serious advantage that supercedes this. That is just a fact.<p>Point 3 is about competition. I&#x27;ll grant you that G+ is no Facebook, but Android is the most widely adopted mobile OS on the planet, and by a <i>huge</i> margin -- iOS is basically not even competitive, except for the top 5% of the market. Further, a billion smartphones will be bought this year, the most of which will be Internet enabled <i>Android</i> devices, and most of which will be bought in developing countries by people coming on the Internet for the first time. You tell me who&#x27;s forward thinking there, because when that market comes online, it will be huge. The fact that you mention this as being non-competitive indicates to me that you might not know what you&#x27;re talking about. :(<p>Point 1 is about the MS org. What can I say, OP, I work here, so maybe I&#x27;m not the best person to have this discussion with. But FWIW I <i>chose</i> this place over some much sexier jobs because the team I work with is arguably the best of its type in the world. There are bad neighborhoods, but the disparity between a good team in MS and a good team at Google is basically negligible. Also I think Windows is one of the great engineering feats of CS, so ... :| (Note that I still use UNIX at home.)<p>Point 4 is probably the result of confusion. I don&#x27;t think no one can compete with Google. Bing has 20% market share! Clearly we can. But I do think it will be hard to compete with Google on <i>search quality</i>. I don&#x27;t see how you can argue that.<p>And point 5 is obviously true but not relevant.<p>EDIT: Actually I now see your point 1 as saying &quot;MS couldn&#x27;t pull this off because they&#x27;re not a good engineering org, but someone else could&quot;. Maybe someone else can build a better search engine, but I think what MS has pulled off with Bing is a <i>monumental</i> feat.<p>For starters, we built the entire Bing stack from scratch. No OSS. No common platforms like the JVM. Nothing like that. We started from nothing, and invented the server infrastructure, the data pipeline, the runtime that would support the site, the ML tools, everything. The fact that the site runs at all is a small miracle, but the site does not &quot;just&quot; run: the most remarkable thing by far is that the quality of our tooling is quite incredible, generally an order of magnitude better than the OSS equivalents. For example, the largest deployment of an OSS NoSQL datastore seems to be a few thousand nodes. The small NoSQL cluster backing our MapReduce implementation is stably deployed on a cluster <i>an order of magnitude larger than this</i>. This is something you only really see at companies like Amazon, Google, or MS.<p>I understand that the consumer market is not something MS is strong at, but I am hoping this gives you a taste of the scale and quality of what&#x27;s happening behind the scenes. Happy to talk more about this if you drop me a line or skype me at `mrclemmer` :)",1388868567

7012840,comment,7012151,7012612,5,0,AJ007,,,"A market I have found very interesting is pen & paper role playing games. There has been an explosion of self-published content in the past three to five years. A good portion of it quite high quality, often coming from authors who previously had written titles for &quot;big&quot; publishers (Even in its glory days TSR was hardly a titan.)<p>The channels users are both finding out about these self published RPGs and purchasing them is not Amazon. Instead it starts with blogs, forums, Kickstarter, and Indiegogo, and is sold directly on the author&#x27;s website, through Lulu, and Drivethrustuff (RPGNow etc.)<p>I was pleasantly surprised to see Wizards offering old Dungeons and Dragons books on RPGNow. Other &quot;big&quot; publishers have been doing the same.<p>As an unknown underdog, you want scale and recognition over paltry margins. Amazon does this for unknown authors by providing mass market distribution. The author still needs to get some initial traction, but the author never loses sales because the consumer couldn&#x27;t find the book, or didn&#x27;t have time to travel to the store while he or she was ready to turn over money in exchange for an unknown book.<p>Bookstores and publishers are the losers here. They are middlemen who do distribution and scaling using methods from the pre-Internet era.<p>As more content becomes digital only it is hard to see retail stores faring well. That may be an understatement, considering that this trend has been well underway for a decade. For now I&#x27;m positive on the prospects for retail clothing stores.",1388868332

But the point is that a detecting corruption is a far different beast than detecting intentional collision attempts.<p>> If they&#x27;re really worried, compare file sizes too.<p>This adds nearly no security.<p>> Then compile the code and verify that the checksum on the executable is the same as before.<p>Compare the whole binary!  If you don&#x27;t trust a SHA1 on the source, trusting a SHA1 on the binary is merely moving the goalposts around.  This also requires deterministic builds - this isn&#x27;t the default or necessairly easy, but it&#x27;s possible and is the approach the TOR project takes at least: <a href""https://blog.torproject.org/category/tags/deterministic-build"" rel""nofollo"">https://blog.torproject.org/category/tags/deterministic-buil...</a><p>Alternatively, even without deterministic builds, compare the whole source tree!  The whole file must be read to compute the hash in the first place, so why not compare all those bytes?<p>> I just think it would be really hard to pull this off<p>And while I would agree with you on that point, the point I&#x27;m trying to make is simply that this has absolutely nothing to do with the fact that git attempts to detect accidental corruption -- the specifics are paramount!  While SHA1 is not the weakest cryptographic hash, it is not the strongest cryptographic hash either.  Git was not designed to focus on cryptographic security, and it was written by a programmer who is not a cryptographic security expert.<p>I would also stress that &quot;really hard&quot; is quite different from &quot;impossible&quot; (an in the general case, quite different from even &quot;unlikely&quot;.)<p>(That said, sneaking in a benign-looking backdoor through standard channels sounds way easier.)",1388867358

I&#x27;ve dealt with Unicode both with and without language support (in Python and elsewhere), and this is a pretty important feature.  I think that the world in general, and the Python world in particular, is better off with Unicode support in the built-in str class.<p>That said, other languages -- most recently and notably, Ruby -- have managed to make the Unicode transition without leaving much of the existing user base behind.  I realize that Python is often used in larger and slower-moving organizations than Ruby, and also has a more conservative philosophy.  Even so, perhaps they could have announced Python 2.8, identical to 2.7 in every way except that strings are now Unicode.  Then, after 1-2 years of everyone getting their Unicode house in order, we could have moved onto 2.9 or 3.0, and/or used the &quot;from future&quot; syntax.<p>There is no perfect solution, but it seems to me that by breaking so many things at once, we&#x27;re in a situation where everyone wants to upgrade, but no one sees the overwhelming benefit from doing so, and thus puts it off even further.",1388867070

7012683,comment,7012239,7012239,64,0,nostrademons,,,"This misses the point of why Python 3 was invented: Unicode.<p>Python 2&#x27;s string handling is broken in the presence of unicode characters, often leading to subtle errors that wouldn&#x27;t cause exceptions until far away from the place where the error was introduced, and oftentimes didn&#x27;t produce exceptions at all, just wrong data.  Strings were defined as sequences of bytes, and then provided a .decode method to convert them to a unicode object that stores them as a sequence of codepoints.  The problem was that a large number of libraries (including all of Aaron&#x27;s that I&#x27;ve looked at) used str as their internal string type, which meant they were storing a sequence of bytes in an arbitrary encoding but not storing the encoding along with it.  If you pass such a library a string in a different encoding, it will happily store it, manipulate it, and concatenate it with other strings.  If you pass such a library multiple strings in multiple encodings (like, for example, if you&#x27;re pulling data from multiple webpages), you will get garbage data that can&#x27;t be decoded in any codec.<p>Python 3 changes this so that str stores unicode codepoints and there&#x27;s a separate &#x27;bytes&#x27; type for uninterpreted bytes, and you are supposed to decode your bytes into strings at system boundaries.  This is recommended software engineering practice for anyone who builds large systems that have to interact with foreign-language text; however, a large number of Python developers work in English-only environments where anything they receive will automatically be ASCII.  They&#x27;ve never tried to track down subtly broken encoding issues; for them, the decode step is extra busywork that seems pointless.<p>The reason the Python2->3 transition has been so painful is that it involves a whole language ecosystem fixing <i>bugs</i> in their software, but the bugs are subtle enough that the vast majority of people doing the work will never have encountered them.<p>You can&#x27;t just use the &quot;from __future__ import python3_unicode&quot; support because this is a change to the semantics of an existing language feature.  In Python2, a string is a sequence of bytes.  In Python3, a string is a sequence of unicode codepoints.  What happens when a Python3 program calls a Python2 library with a string object?  Do you try to auto-convert the strings?  You can&#x27;t, really, because strings in Python2 don&#x27;t specify their encoding; you have no way of knowing which codec the Python2 library <i>meant</i>, because chances are they didn&#x27;t think about it.<p>The other major change in Python 3 - iterators everywhere - is similar, and it&#x27;s a recognition that an increasingly large proportion of the programming ecosystem lives in a world where async operation is important and many concurrent activities may be happening at once.  And I&#x27;m really glad to see Python willing to take on these challenges even with 5 years of short-term pain, because it shows a commitment to keeping Python relevant for the issues that 21st-century programmers will face.  An increasing number of software platforms will have to deal with non-English text; an increasing number will need to handle concurrent, event-based environments.  Without these changes Python would basically cede these areas to languages like Go or Javascript that have their unicode story straight and are well-adapted to async programming.",1388866322

Both should have a place in your toolbox, and to say that one is superior to the other is simply trolling for a religious war.<p>REST is not relegated to CRUD, and is being grossly misrepresented when it is said to.  SQL is a scripting language, not a RPC or REST API.  If you can make SQL into a RPC, I&#x27;d love to see it.  It must be absolutely nasty.<p>RPC is great for situations where you don&#x27;t necessarily need an answer, or the answer is so abstract that it doesn&#x27;t really relate to a specific resource.  The great thing about  RPC is you usually have something like a WSDL that many tools can use to generate your client code for you.  It makes it very easy to implement into your client project, but can be very brittle, as any changes to the WSDL will break the client.<p>REST is great for when your actions revolve around resources, whether they be actions or access.  Not everything needs to be relegated to the URL.  You can post or put just about anything in the body, including SQL if you were so inclined (please don&#x27;t ever do something like that).  The thing about this is you&#x27;re using the resource in the URL as context, so it&#x27;s a different way of modeling your API.  Though there is WADL and a couple of other standards for describing a RESTful service, none of them are well accepted and there is poor tool support for generating client code for you.  This is a disadvantage in that it forces you to roll your own code (which probably averages about 5 lines per call), but is an advantage in that you can easily follow a &quot;tolerant reader&quot; methodology which makes your client highly resistant to API breakage.<p>If you&#x27;re smart, you&#x27;ll use HATEOAS in your responses.  It may not be used by all clients, it&#x27;s up to them, but it does  allow flexibility if they do use it.  We&#x27;ve had great success with it at the Fortune 100 company I work for.<p>I agree that many people use REST as a marketing term and don&#x27;t fully understand it.  Those who do though are using it successfully and enjoy when the opportunity to use it for their project.  The important thing is to remember that both are important and not try to fit one into a hole that calls for the other.",1388865789

I’m iterating over 16,384 pixels every time you hit the button, and there’s no perceptable delay at all, at least on my Macbook.<p>You have a computer that can execute 3 billion synchronous instructions per second* . Suppose that javascript was extremely <i>in</i>efficient (it&#x27;s not), and required 10,000 machine instructions to iterate through the loop and set a pixel. The time to execute 10,000 machine instructions is about 50 milliseconds. I found that I didn&#x27;t notice a delay until about 200 milliseconds (modifying the code with a setTimeout function). Such excessive waste would not be noticeable to a casual observer (you can run randomized A/B tests on yourself to investigate this :) ).<p>The work that has gone into v8 is very impressive. Arguably, however, the sheer brute force power of modern CPU&#x27;s is more so. Don&#x27;t underestimate it. :)<p>* Give or take.

256470,comment,256069,256069,0,0,DanielBMarkham,,,"Not one of the better essays. Reminds me of somebody poorly channeling Chomsky.<p>Labels are nouns. That's all. Nouns have meaning based on how we use them. Guess what? Nouns are always imprecise. Language is slippery, my dear friends, as those of you who ever tried to write a system based on somebody else's input know.<p>So we're stuck debating and talking about things with words that flex a lot. That's why the #1 thing to do in a discussion, debate, or whatever is talk about terms. It sounds silly, but you have to say things like ""when you say 'cat', what exactly do you mean?""<p>As a political junkie, let me offer an example. Reagan rallied against ""tax and spend liberals"" -- folks who thought of solving problems from the top-down using government funds and power, instead of from the bottom-up. He was so successful, he inspired a lot of radio commentators who beat the ""liberal"" phrase to death. As of today, the best word that describes what ""liberal"" used to describe is ""progressive"", although there are many who are proud to still be called ""liberal""<p>The kicker is that ""liberal"" doesn't _really_ mean what Reagan used it for at all. It originally meant somebody supportive of free speech and action. Heck, as a libertarian, I am a classic liberal. We all probably are.<p>But most of us real people who live in the real world are stuck with messy words like these because humans are not machines. So we say wonderfully obscenely mushy things like ""as a liberal I'm not at all supportive of the current progressive agenda""<p>There's a reason the Lincoln-Douglas debates went on for four hours or more. Language is tough to do. It does not reduce to something like p or ~ q. Labels only shut you down if you're damn fool enough not to qualify the label as soon as its used. I'm just glad I'm not writing AI to figure all of this out.",1216982577

256466,comment,255451,255451,0,0,DanielBMarkham,,,"Assuming for a minute that this is a person who honestly feels these questions are off-limits (as opposed to just trying to crank up the old hit machine) I think the questions say more about the questioner than the questions themselves.<p>In certain circles all of these questions are on the table -- including a lot more obnoxious questions than he thought about. In certain circles a lot more questions are off limits (I'm thinking of the former dean of Harvard and his simple suggestion that ""Do the sexes learn differently?"" would be a provocative question. Poor schmuck)<p>I liked #1 the best, about evolving the human genome. The reason why is that it seems so logical at the surface -- if people can be ""bred"" like cats and dogs, why not breed them for qualities we all hold dear?<p>The coolest part of that question is that we immediately hit Godwin's law and end up where all internet discussions lead -- Nazis. And for good reason! They had the same ideas. (I won't go into trashing the entire notion. Too easy to do. I would add that most attacks on it are a lot more emotional than rational though)",1216981895

It's not only the challenge of the work anymore, it's the commitment everyone has made to each other. They stop being at work all the time because they're solving world hunger and start being at work all the time because -- it's home.<p>Doesn't happen all the time, but I've seen it more than once. I'm sure there are other scenarios that could play out.",1216981191

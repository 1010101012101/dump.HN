Obamacare is a part of it  - the law was full of bugs and nonsense like 1099 provisions, its implementation was the regular disaster and as always, it was massively oversold, underdelivered and took more money and produced less useful effects and more unexpected conseqences then planned.

What I think makes them impressive is staying power, long term endurance. They can weather a poor product, tweak it and get to good years after anyone is interested in talking about it. The backwards compatibility culture is part of that. They can keep up a steady pace uphill or downhill and get there. That&#x27;s impressive.<p>That said, I think Microsoft is very committed to a bunch of paradigms that are real losers. A windows machine, more than any of the &quot;computers&quot; that we have around us seem to be made for use by individuals under supervision and control of IT, in the school or office. I think that&#x27;s a loser paradigm. The &quot;personal&quot; part of computers is important. I think it works better, and that is relevant in education.<p>The paradigm is hard to kill because it helps them negotiate with school systems and work systems. Microsoft&#x27;s marathon endurance for dealing with persistent hairiness lets organizations maintain their fragile ecosystems of servers, applications, permissions and such. These might be necessary, but they also pressure Microsoft into building a &quot;faster horse&quot; (to butcher the Ford cliche).<p>Unless they can manage to put below median users in charge, I think they&#x27;ll ultimately lose the education market.<p>I don&#x27;t know who will &quot;win&quot; but I think there&#x27;s an inherent advantage to anything self sufficient and sell sustained, things that don&#x27;t require a &quot;roll out&quot; or where the roll out is small and contained.

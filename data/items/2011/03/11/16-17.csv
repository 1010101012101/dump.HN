They started developing two OS ecosystems that are totally different, and I think they sort of knew that eventually one would win out. I bet that Chrome OS is still in active development because Google isn't 100% sure of Android's future since it's still so young.<p>A Chrome OS netbook can cold boot in a few seconds, has a nice hardware keyboard, <i>excellent</i> user switching and cloud-based data storage. Chrome OS is far ahead of Android in terms of the ""ideal"" cloud landscape where your settings, data, and everything else is totally 100% okay even if you set your machine on fire and smash it with a hammer. Try smashing your Windows netbook and see what happens to your documents.<p>So I definitely think they've got a place in the market and I think they know that.

2313807,comment,2313534,2313773,0,0,Udo,,,"I disagree. The simplest thing an attacker can do is sniffing the local traffic. It's a passive job, they don't even have to crack or break into anything, and what they're doing is essentially undetectable. Encryption helps against this, but not against man-in-the-middle attacks, that's true. However, those attacks are much more difficult to pull off than sniffing. Especially if you exchange a cert with your server just once, as you do in SSH. I do believe denying users access to encryption out of a fear of man-in-the-middle attacks and instead defaulting them to a completely unsecured link was and remains a dick move.<p>In case it wasn't obvious: I love SSH because it doesn't rely on cert authorities and because it's ridiculously easy to establish a reasonably secure connection; it empowers users and server admins to no end. Is it exploitable? Yes! But I do believe it's difficult and far less likely than exploiting an unencrypted connection. And I'll say it again: denying users access to this basic mechanism was not a nice maneuver.",1299860247

Must support: iPhone, Android, Blackberry. Nice to have: iPad / tablets, Windows 7 Mobile, older feature phones.<p>Background: Google Web Toolkit (GWT) does not natively support mobile web browsers. GWT was adopted by our company for its cross browser support, our developers' familiarity with Java server-side development, our lack of in-house JavaScript/HTML/CSS mastery, and the relative immaturity of JQuery at the time (early 2007). Now, in March 2011, JQuery is mature and widely adopted, JQuery Mobile 1.0 is near, and the JQuery plugin ecosystem is thriving.<p>A few possible solutions:<p>Leverage our web app's GWT codebase with one or more of: GWT Mobile, gwt-mobile-webkit, PhoneGap w/ GWT, m-gwt. (I'd question the maturity of each of these.)<p>Create separate mobile pages/apps from scratch using JQuery Mobile and plugins. (This is unappealing as it looks like a ""full rewrite"".)<p>Create native mobile apps.

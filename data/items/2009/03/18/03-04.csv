If the kid across the street goes to fancy pre-school, he's going to get advantages you'll miss out on that will put him ahead of the game.<p>I just read Gladwell's ""Outliers"" this week and he talks at length about this very thing.<p>Here's how he puts it.  If you're in Canada and you were born just days after the cut-off for age group hockey, then when you're 10, you'll be 6-7 months older than a lot of the other kids on your team.  That makes a big difference at that age.  So you'll make the traveling team and the younger kids won't.  On the traveling team, you get better coaches, better equipment, better opponents.  So the gap between you and those other kids gets A LOT wider.<p>Five years later, you're maybe looking at the NHL while those other kids are sitting in the stands, because you got access to the better coaches, because you were born 6 months before them.<p>That's why the parents want to get their kids into the fancy pre-schools.<p>Outliers is an excellent book.

Politicians preferred to keep banks small, fearing the power of larger banks. You see, anti-capitalism and a populist distaste for financiers are nothing new.<p>Perhaps surprisingly, states that forced banks to be small were the hardest hit by bank failures in the Depression. The tiny, unthreatening banks did not have the margin of error to wait out the financial chaos. Meanwhile, places like Canada that allowed large national banking conglomerates avoided bank failures almost entirely.<p>Our recent crisis was very different from the Great Depression. Contrary to the 1930s, scale was often a vulnerability, and not an asset. However, the example of the Great Depression ought to drive home to us the danger of optimizing to the last crisis, lest we precipitate a new one in our rashness.<p>There is also danger in drawing simple, neat lessons from a messy crisis. Scale was not always our enemy. We must remember that several private firms were bailed out, not by public dollars, but by private acquirers. Wachovia's sale to Wells Fargo would have been legal under many of the world's regulatory regimes, and it was legal in the 2008 United States, but it would not have been legal in the 1998 United States when we still had anti-scale laws on the books. If those regulations were still in place, at least a few more large firms would have been at the government's door, hat in hand.<p>Populism is politically fruitful, but it can wreak havoc on an economy, and it is almost never thoughtful or well-informed. We ought to pause before giving in to its mellifluous rhetoric.",1237347614

521117,comment,520836,521107,0,0,brandnewlow,,,"One more thing.  And this is the idea that helped explain how this stuff worked.<p>If a school's admitting X kids, you have to completely forget about that number.  That number is meaningless.  There's a certain percentage of X that's just spoken for.  There are kids you have to admit to keep the school running and to meet all its institutional needs.  Once you figure out how many kids that is, subtract that from the number of kids you're supposedly admitting.  THAT number is your actual class size, the number of kids who get admitted by the full process, being pitted against one another.<p>I found my job made a lot more sense once I told myself I was working to admit X-Y kids rather than just X kids.  So when you hear about how low the admission rates are, realize that in reality, they're significantly lower due to so many spots being claimed in each class by legacies, minorities, athletes, geniuses, politicians kids, potential big donors etc.  These kids don't face the same process as everyone else.",1237347551

521107,comment,520836,521034,0,0,brandnewlow,,,"It is, by design, a black box process.<p>Colleges live and die by who they admit.  The elite admission process is designed to give them the largest selection pool possible and total control over who gets in out of it.  They hold all cards and will never give that up.<p>There are great advantages to this.  If you need 5 viola players one year.  You can take 5 viola players. No sweat. Those five kids will never find out that's why they got in, but that might have been the case.  Certainly, these are awesome kids.  But in a pool of 12,000 awesome kids, sometimes the viola swings the committee's vote.<p>If you need some kids from Western Michigan, you can take some kids from Western Michigan.  Maybe there's a donor there.  Or an influential alum who's mad that no one from that part of the state has been admitted in years.  Who knows?  These kids are jokingly called ""area adds.""  Again, these are great kids.  But their point of origin and perspective on it might just be the thing that swings the  vote in a sea of 12,000 awesome kids.  I'm fairly certain that's why I was admitted and I only think this because I spent two years admitting thousands of kids.  I was a strong applicant able to talk interestingly about my origins.  My grades and scores sure didn't show the firepower that the kids out east had, but they've gotta take someone from podunk Michigan now and then.<p>The top colleges are skeptical of all the standardized tests and most of the high school curriculums. This is both because of arrogance but also because they have data that the public doesn't.  Every year we'd get a very sophisticated, confidential briefing from the folks at one of the big companies that showed the latest trends in their data.  This was always somewhat shocking and fascinating, too.  I can't say much about it other than this: the kids you think would do well on the tests do incredibly well.  The kids you think will do badly, do very, very badly.  Across the board.  Everywhere.  No matter what.<p>The things that I couldn't handle, personally, were the minority admissions and the elite prep school admissions.  This is not because anything particularly underhanded or amoral or unethical was happening, but because the debates and arguments about how these cases should be handled simply required intellectual bandwidth that I didn't have.  I couldn't plot a course that would carry me through how to deal with these kids and didn't much feel like making the effort it seemed I'd have to make to do so.  There were times when it just seemed so unfair to admit a student with crummy grades and crummy test scores (relative to our applicant pool) because of her racial background.  But there were other times when I was so impressed by other qualities in a student's application that I fought for them harder than anyone.<p>I visited some scary high schools in Philadelphia one year and met a kid who'd been corresponding with the foremost authority on Bram Stoker's Dracula via e-mail, on his own. I told him I wrote my senior thesis about the novel and his face lit up.  I think mine did a bit, too.  It's not often you get to talk about your specialty with someone else.<p>This was an African American student at an inner city school.  All the teachers had been telling me all day that he was ""the one"" I needed to talk to, because it was so ridiculously apparent to them that he was sincerely, legitimately, maybe desperately trying to transcend his circumstances.  And now he's able to talk about the plot structure of Dracula with someone.<p>Sure enough, his credentials were average for the applicant pool, but he was as easy a case as any.  To speak to the audience here, he was hacking his social circumstances and we were interested in that.<p>So yes, it's very byzantine.  It's a mess.  You'd read applications for 7 days a week for 4 months all winter, annotating them, scribbling in the margins, knowing that very, very few of these kids were getting in.<p>Then you block out a whole month of sitting around a table eating catered food, sweeping across whole states worth of applicants in 15-hour days, debating, discussing, arguing, fighting over kid after kid after kid in committees of 5-6 people.  I always enjoyed that part, but we had one officer who would cry at some point almost every day during committee. She believed we were slamming the door on a lot of these kids.<p>Personally, I believe they'll do fine wherever they end up if they/re as good as they say are.  It'd be great to dump a bunch of resources on them so they can live ""the life"" for 4 years, but you can't celebrate every kid.<p>P.S. While I've got the floor and your ears about college admissions, I run the web's only independent directory of College Admissions Consultants at <a href=""http://CollegeConsultantReviews.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://CollegeConsultantReviews.com</a>.

The goal here is to advance the state of the art in browsers. Performance, stability, and security (in terms of process isolation) were and still are lacking in all other browsers compared to Chrome. This is very much about pushing the state of the web, not about gaining market share. Google Chrome delivers in this regards.",1237346246

That's really the single-biggest feature that I would love to see in Firefox.<p>If not for a few must-have plugins that keep me coming back to Firefox, and of course the lack of Linux support, I would have switched to Chrome the moment it came out on that single feature alone.",1237345708

Whether it technically won't work, or whether it will slow down the internet aren't the real issues, because someday, it technically will work and won't slow down the internet.<p>The real argument to make is that this is wrong because censorship is wrong, and because this is the thin end of the wedge of tyranny.  It always starts with child porn or terrorism, because everyone hates terrorists and pedophiles.  Once the government gets the capability, they just start taking more and more.  Even this article talks about blocking anti-abortion websites.  Abortion is one of the most important social issues today, and they're saying that we can't argue against the government position on the internet?  How will we ever make progress as a society if we can't talk about anything different than what we are doing today?",1237345470

It’s crucial to be INTERESTING – what knowledge do you have that others would be entertained by, but feeds back into your startup solving a challenge? Doing something better / faster?<p>SECOND : Contact blogs in your target market category and ask nicely to guest blog, use http://technorati.com/blogs/directory/ or http://www.alltop.com or http://www.blogcatalog.com to find bloggers. Just fill out their “contact us” forms, but write each one personally.<p>THIRD:  Write a 3 – 4 paragraph “article” giving your unique take on the problem you’re working on solving. Point out a flaw and how you’re working to correct it. Don’t be OVERTLY selling your company, but don’t let anybody miss the point that your start-up is solving that problem.<p>RESULTS: \nOur contact to post rate was for each 10 emails we got ~2 rejections, ~5 ignores, ~3 successes.\nFor each success we wrote a unique article. Same content, written for each audience specially though.<p>You now have PR friendly inbound links.<p>You now have curious visitors in your target market.<p>And if you’re lucky somebody truly useful will notice and repost.",1237345416

I greatly enjoy international films, and personally think that less gore makes it much more effective as a tool - take a look at Japanese horror on one extreme, and compare it to a Schwarzenegger movie. In Total Recall, a guy gets a pipe stuck through his head, and it has no effect on the audience. But it was what was - a fun, man's man action movie. If you produce for intelligent people, you can potentially get a lot of hardcore and intelligent fans. But that means needing to break from the formulas and execute well, neither of which are easy. The mass market stuff works for the mass market of course - so have a think on what you're going for. Maybe take a look at some enthusiast forums or communities - that'd be a smart place to first promote yourself. What are their expectations? What do they like? You can always sell out to the mass market later once you get popular :)",1237345395

I want 60fps with tons of elements on screen, I want to be able to tap into the OS and integrate with it. Our auto-tracing code would take advantage of all your computer&#x27;s cores. I even wrote my own custom text layout engine and now you can do some really cool things with it. I love the interactivity and fluidity of native apps.<p>You&#x27;re absolutely right that once you have the app, it&#x27;s yours to keep.

8446003,comment,8443841,8445795,0,0,Voodoo463,,,"This is an intriguing question, one I hope I might be able to shed some light on:<p>I am no good at starcraft, at least in comparison to those I play with, but I once was a grand master tetris player that played the world circuit for a time, and this is what I discovered:<p>Practice yields results. These results give you a rush, and you start to ascend, the more you play the better you play, the higher your score, or the better your results.<p>Now your opponents are more skilled, for they too have been going on the same cycle, and you find for every match you win, there is another you loose: 50 - 50 ratio.<p>This is where the gameplay gets interesting: if you want to advance you will have to realize some things.<p>Energy and time output. The further you want to advance the longer it will take, for example: going from the skills to achieve master tetris player rank to grandmaster in the world circuit was much more difficult than getting the skills to be of &#x27;master&#x27; rank.<p>What I learned when I plateaued as an advanced player at an advanced rank was that, in order to continue, I needed to unlearn everything I knew about playing tetris and relearn how to play the game from the ground up using my experience in the execution of the game and going from there; this got me to master, and when I hit master I also plateaued, and in order to get to grandmaster, I had to completely relearn how to play the game for a third time, at this point i had retaught it to myself 4 different times, each succeeding time with more rules, theories, and how to best capitalize on luck.<p>This is why I say: Practice yields results. Practice does not make perfect; perfect practice (I.E. that thing you learn once you reteach the art of play to yourself for the umpteeinth time) makes perfect.<p>If you have plateaued, I would recommend taking everything you have learned about the game up to now, archiving it for reference, but focus on coming at the game with a new perspective. A friend of mine plays MLG fps&#x27;s and destroys everyone he plays against outside of upper competitive gameplay, and he can&#x27;t aim. His aim is absolutely abysmal, but he makes up for it by knowing how fast his character moves in each of the maps, he has researched the button magnetism per game, he knows the distance from one place to another and calculates the resulting probabilities of death and luck; but generally he relies on plain trickery, solid reflexes and many hours of gameplay.",1413136603

I want the app to read my SMS, as it does something that I want with them; so I enable that feature.<p>2. I don&#x27;t want the app to read my SMS for whatever arbitrary reason that doesn&#x27;t matter and doesn&#x27;t need to be justified to anyone.

I have no experience programming for Windows (e.g., MFC, WinForms, WPF) nor Linux (GTK+ / Qt - I dabbled a bit many years ago but that&#x27;s about it).<p>2) Why not use a cross-platform toolkit? Fundamentally, a cross-platform app is at odds with our core value - providing the best user experience. In practical terms, this means we have to use the native toolkit for the platform. While it is true that you can use a cross-platform toolkit, the experience will never be as good as it can be. Moreover, not only do I lack experience with such toolkits, if we want to make a cross-platform app, we would want it to feel native on all major OSs. This involves an incredible amount of work and resources that we do not have.<p>It all boils down to the fact that we want to make the best app for the platform that we have experience with.<p>Hope that clarifies the reason why it&#x27;s Mac-only.",1413136131

Ebola spreads through contact with bodily fluids. Someone who not syptomatic (or in the early stages of their symptoms) does not produce much in the way of &#x27;extra&#x27; bodily fluids, so the risk is quite small in terms of casual contacts. It&#x27;s only when they become quite sick that they start produce massive amounts of infectious fluids, and that&#x27;s when healthcare workers are most likely to come into contact with them. In fact, the sicker they become, the more fluids they produce, and the more care they need...<p>> There are two cases as I see it. Either it&#x27;s likely that other people, non-health workers, have been infected. We just don&#x27;t know about it yet, or it has been decided that it&#x27;s not in the public&#x27;s interest to know. Or the protective measures are so bad, the disease so misunderstood or hard to protect against, that health workers effectively can&#x27;t protect themselves against the risk.<p>The third option (and the most likely one) is that people make mistakes. The protective measures work if used properly, but they have to be used properly _every time_. With half a dozen cases being treated in the US, I&#x27;m somewhat surprised we&#x27;ve only had one lapse leading to an infection so far. However, as long as the average number of healthcare workers infected per patient stays well below 1, we&#x27;ve got nothing to worry about.",1413135280

We will address this below. Briefly, however, the important points are that virus-laden bodily fluids may be aerosolized and inhaled while a person is in proximity to an infectious person and that a wide range of particle sizes can be inhaled and deposited throughout the respiratory tract.<p>> ...<p>> Modern research, using more sensitive instruments and analytic methods, has shown that aerosols emitted from the respiratory tract contain a wide distribution of particle sizes—including many that are small enough to be inhaled. Thus, both small and large particles will be present near an infectious person.<p>> The current paradigm also assumes that only &quot;small&quot; particles (less than 5 micrometers [mcm]) can be inhaled and deposited in the respiratory tract. This is not true. Particles as large as 100 mcm (and perhaps even larger) can be inhaled into the mouth and nose. Larger particles are deposited in the nasal passages, pharynx, and upper regions of the lungs, while smaller particles are more likely to deposit in the lower, alveolar regions. And for many pathogens, infection is possible regardless of the particle size or deposition site.<p>> It&#x27;s time to abandon the old paradigm of three mutually exclusive transmission routes for a new one that considers the full range of particle sizes both near and far from a source. In addition, we need to factor in other important features of infectivity, such as the ability of a pathogen to remain viable in air at room temperature and humidity and the likelihood that systemic disease can result from deposition of infectious particles in the respiratory system or their transfer to the gastrointestinal tract.<p>> We recommend using &quot;aerosol transmissible&quot; rather than the outmoded terms &quot;droplet&quot; or &quot;airborne&quot; to describe pathogens that can transmit disease via infectious particles suspended in air.<p><a href=""http://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2014/09/commentary-health-workers-need-optimal-respiratory-protection-ebola"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cidrap.umn.edu/news-perspective/2014/09/commentar...</a><p>> Here, we provide data on the stability and viability of MARV and ZEBOV in both liquid media and on a range of solid substrates at various temperatures, over time.

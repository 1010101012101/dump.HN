6088158,comment,6083432,6085665,1,0,diydsp,,,"I agree.  I don&#x27;t have a specific plan, either, but I have intuitions.  The key things we need to address are people&#x27;s natural spiritual and medical curiosity.  In another thread, someone pointed out some hackers hack to scratch an itch, not just for fun.  I believe the same can be said for needlepoint, carpentry and heroin.<p>We could make space in society for people to explore the parallel worlds.  Maybe a week per year research period.  \nMany users I know of all types of drugs take them just to <i>tolerate</i> their jobs.  We could somehow make work more tolerable.<p>We could make everyday life more fulfilling and have less stigma attached to exploring alternate states of mind.  We need to find a way to fit or shoehorn this stuff into our lives because we can&#x27;t eradicate it.  Perhaps this is the skill of the shamanic ritual and modern day music festivals...  to put boundaries of time and space around the exploration of this alternate states of mind.  We need to protect and shepherd people into safe places while they&#x27;re experimenting and keep them away from responsible areas like driving and machinery while they&#x27;re temporarily intoxicated.  We need to keep them productive even if they&#x27;re using.",1374551965

While I haven&#x27;t actually looked at financial statements for those businesses since they were way out of my budget, I&#x27;d get the occasional listing with numbers like that. Businesses like <a href=""http://www.bizbuysell.com/Business-Opportunity/Sushi-Restaurant-Very-Profitable/680488/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.bizbuysell.com/Business-Opportunity/Sushi-Restaur...</a> - nearly $700k in earnings in one year is not bad at all.<p>It&#x27;s up for debate how much the owner actually makes and how much of the sales goes unreported to the BOE, IRS, etc., but it&#x27;s within the realm of possibility.<p>Alternatively, absentee-own a franchise or series of stores for similar effect: <a href=""http://www.bizbuysell.com/Business-Opportunity/4-Unit-Five-Guys-for-sale-includes-Develoment-Territory/742279/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.bizbuysell.com/Business-Opportunity/4-Unit-Five-G...</a><p>> What makes your restaurant so succesful, isn&#x27;t that industry plagued with 80% shutdown wiyhin 5 years?<p>I can believe the failure rate is that high for brand new restaurants, but that is why you buy already established businesses instead. I also don&#x27;t think that number is too strange in the context of all brand new businesses. Think of how many startups fail. Imagine if there was a market for buying and selling &quot;matured&quot; startups - that&#x27;s basically how small business sales work. (Hopefully) all the bad ones will have died out already, the ones the owners are trying to flip as fast as possible before they die are dead obvious, and you&#x27;ll maybe be left over with a few sustainable businesses to choose from.<p>I think the only difference between running a restaurant and starting a startup is that there is no restaurant equivalent to winning the jackpot (read: selling your startup for mega bucks) and just keeping the business in the black is the norm (although, now that I think about it, I&#x27;m not sure how a lot of startups can even dream to accomplish that...).<p>As for what makes my restaurant successful? My takeover may have been this year, but it&#x27;s sat at the same location for decades (older than I am, even) and we have big servings and tasty fries. :D",1374551911

It&#x27;s interesting to note, though, the difference between extrinsic and intrinsic causal factors: the Black Death significantly increased real peasant wages and per capita wealth, likely helping the transition from a feudal to capitalist society through dispersing capital more widely.

According to the U.S., state-sanctioned terrorism is still terrorism, not legitimate military action, and a violation of international law. Therefore the U.S. maintains a list of &quot;State Sponsors of Terrorism&quot;, countries that it alleges engage in such unlawful tactics, either directly or via proxies.

If some community member in leaderboard started having secret extra marital affair, should it be on frontpage of HN? I think it should be left to community to decide. What I was trying to say is that lack of downvote button disables community to make this decision. When you have only upvote button, a small group of people can collude (knowingly or unknowingly) to push anything at the top very easily whether it reflects the general sentiment in community or not. I&#x27;m still not proposing HN should starting having downvote button. As a machine learning guy, I&#x27;m endlessly fascinated with collaborative filtering and this is interesting case for me how lack of downvote/dislike/negative ratings impacts relevance.",1374549538

6088030,comment,6085768,6087411,2,0,yk,,,"Sorry for the botched formatting (HN is for some reason not showing me a edit link :/ )<p>A quite interesting paper on the topic is McMonigal & al. [1], it is a bit technical but they discuss the Alcubierre warp drive quite nicely.<p>To elaborate on the second paragraph about special relativity, one way to define Lorentz transformations is, that they are the transformations which preserve the causal structure of Minkowsky space. On the other hand, the speed limit is a direct consequence of the Lorentz transformations. So the causal structure and the speed limit are directly related. To look again at the argument that a velocity larger than the speed of light implies causality violation: The moment you argue that a speed faster than the speed of light is possible, you implicitly change the meaning of causality. Then you use the Lorentz transformations to conclude that in on frame of reference event A precedes B and that event B precedes A in another. So you first deny the special status of the Lorentz transformation, just to go on and use Lorentz transformations. And my take on this is a strong maybe, the moment you start talking about local Lorentz invariance violation, anything goes. Perhaps there is causality violation, perhaps not, but this depends on your specific meaning of &#x27;causality&#x27; and &#x27;faster than light&#x27; and not very much on special relativity.<p>[1] <a href=""http://arxiv.org/abs/1202.5708"" rel=""nofollow"">http://arxiv.org/abs/1202.5708</a>",1374549401

A test that demonstrates amazing results is going to be more visible than the ones that demonstrate weak results.

Any legitimate brewing or distilling operation is being looked at from too many angles related to food regulations and taxes and OSHA and so on to be able to risk having undocumented workers make bathtub gin in a basement while killing off their competition.<p>From this, we can predict that outlawing porn, or making some kinds of porn illegal, will only serve to make the production of that porn a nastier, more illegal business which does more overall harm to society.<p>In short: Crime breeds crime.",1374548429

But I got a reply along the lines of &quot;too late, the patent has been granted&quot;. It turned out that the application was kept secret until it was granted, thus guaranteeing protection from any prior art not already known to the patent office employee assigned to that patent.<p>The &quot;new&quot; US patent laws require an application to be made public after 18 months, but there could be thousands upon thousands of older patent applications benefiting from the secret option.",1374548400

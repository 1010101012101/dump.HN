This will not work well with how I (and presumably many other folks) use git/hg/et al.<p>Namely, for every little project with writing (latex) or programming (in some language), I create a repo. Over the course of a given year, this means easily 50+ repos, some short lived, some that I use for quite a while. I do not want to be dealing with a sidepane of my repos unless i can toggle it to show just eg ""my 10 most recent repos"" or the like, which I don't think gitbox seems to presently offer that.<p>Also, I approve of the choice of having a 1 repo limit thing as the distinguisher  between with and sans license.<p>another question is: how do you plan to distinguish yourself from smartgit, which is the current / only gui'd paid osx git app?",1290880780

RIM has been doing a good job differentiating itself as a business solution. I don't they are going to die anytime soon, but they're slow pace of innovation, software updates are hurting their consumer market....but then again apple can come out with a phone with a broken antenna and expect to sell millions, RIM has a far more corporate audience, so they need to be careful how they expand. All in all, it may seem like rim is dying for a consumer perspective, but I think they may still have a chance, although with a smaller market share.",1290880761

What I find appealing is their attempt to solve the distributed sync problem.  That's useful, but adopting couchdb on all the clients doesn't make much sense. Microsoft's sync framework is moving to allowing full cross language / platform sync. It already allows two-way syncing odata feeds to the iPhone, android, windows phone, and pure javascipt. I don't see why I need build all my clients on couchdb directly to get this functionality. It seems like a nonstarter for 95 percent of use cases.",1290880606

The problem is, RIM's lost track of what they're doing.<p>If trying to beat the best, you have to play catch up to keep yourselves at a particular threshold of relevance. Unfortunately RIM's doing that poorly with some poor strategies (how many devices do they have right now?) At the same time, it looks like they're losing site of their core market, big business.<p>Big efforts from RIM have suffered from RIM rushing products out the door. Look at the Storm, arguably OS6 and the PlayBook. RIM's running themselves thin. If they can learn from this rough patch, I think they can make a case to lead again. But that's a big IF",1290880594

For example,mtgs series on QuickDraw GX is tedious in it's repetition, but if you skip that, it nicely describes a very much complete 2D Graphics system.<p>How to solve it.<p>The art of computer programming (volumes 1, 2, and 3). What helped here is that my public library had them, but they are nice to read, if you have the mathematical background (it definitely helps to read this in parallel with a study in number theory, combinatorics, etc)<p>Anatomy of Lisp.<p>The art of the meta-object protocol.<p>Out of the inner circle.<p>The Soul of a new Machine.<p>Unix Internals, the new frontiers.<p>Effective C++.<p>SICP.<p>More recently, I found the C# specification a page turner.

I've got IPv6 connectivity (via 6to4 and HE tunnel broker) for more than two years. All I remember is watching that dancing turtle, visiting Google search over IPv6 (once or twice, maybe, because typing ""ipv6.google.com"" is inconvenient and pointless), read Python docs and updated various GNU/Linux distros from IPv6-capable mirrors. Oh, the <i>only</i> really useful thing is the ability to directly ssh/scp into any computer at my home without constructing additional tunnels to overcome limitation of having a single globally-routable IPv4 address per 6 devices.<p>It's not like most ISPs can provide IPv6 support easily, but even those who can see no point in doing so. NAT64+DNS64 is resourcewise worse than classic IPv4 NAT. Some (lots?) of clients will experience all sorts of strange client-side bugs with IPv6-only connectivity.

It was a great language for several reasons: it was mostly imperative (meaning I didn't have to try to gasp objects right away; there were OO extensions, but I didn't have to use them initially), statically typed (meaning I <i>did</i> have to learn about interfaces and implementations), allowed for raw memory access (so you could learn about pointers and memory management) while having ""real"" arrays and strings (so you could learn these concepts and write basic programs <i>before</i> learning pointers).<p>Going from Pascal to C (at the age of 14) was easy for me, including dealing with the fact arrays and strings (as my handle suggests) are pointers (I know what pointers were and how to deal with them, while at the same time knowing what strings and arrays are for). Moving to C <i>was</i> a necessity, as I was finding myself writing far too much inline assembly without actually knowing assembly (Google ""Why Pascal is not my favorite language"" for the reason why), but it was much smoother than learning programming from scratch with C.<p>In college/university, the CS courses were all taught in C which, I think, gave me somewhat an unfair advantage over students who didn't program <i>before</i> coming to university (unfortunately, as a transfer student I was exempt from the ""great equalizer"" class which forced everyone to learn Haskell).<p>It's sad that schools these days face the choices of: teaching C which forces students to deal with issues tangential to what they're learning, teaching Java or Python which exclude <i>very important</i> aspects of programming and data structure implementation, or teaching a language which likely no longer even has a stable and widely available implementation but is more suited for the ""pedagogic"" role.

You will not find many Rubyists who say, ""Gee, I don't mind programming, but I can't relate to people who feel fulfilled by writing beautiful code.  I don't understand much about this language but what I understand seems to be enough to read and write code and get my work done.""  For them, the ""joy of Python"" is simply the absence of various forms of pain caused by the need to be overly intellectually involved with something tangential to their work.  It's like the joy of waking up on Sunday morning and going off to do something you really <i>want</i> to do instead of going to a cathedral and sitting bored surrounded by people who are transported by the beautiful stained glass, hymns, communion with God, and everything else you don't care about.<p>P.S.

I suspect that everybody else on HN signs in the choir as well.<p>Jeff Atwood once pointed out that he wasn't trying to write for his readers, he was trying to write for the millions of programmers worldwide who don't read any blogs at all.

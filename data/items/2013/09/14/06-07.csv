6384905,comment,6375144,6375144,2,0,aakashbarot,,,"Excellent question. \nI would answer this question from system perspective. What are the challenges faced by existing online learning solution.<p>There are problems with the learners itself and there are problems with existing solutions.<p>Problem with learner: \n1. Not being self Regulation<p>Existing Solution problems:\n2. Different mental make up of user but similar intervention for all.\n3. Challenges in Learning interventions discovery<p>Lets go in detail:\n1. Regulation results into failure of self discipline. We are conditioned to be externally regulated and not internally. Our current system have conditioned that there would be someone who will tell them what to do. Be our school system or our parents. They will prevent us from doing something wrong or tell us what is the right thing to do. What we need is to make students feel they are responsible for their own decision and action. When you feel responsible for your action, you take things seriously. You get self disciplined. (Learned partially from: Paul Kim)(Reports on not using system regularly or in a disciplined way)<p>2. Different mental make up. We all are wired differently, but the courses offered are from one perspective in one way only. Every learner has a different level of understanding, learning gaps, misconception and learning style (MI theory by howard garnder) But courses today treats them same way. There might be a student struggling to learn compare fractions because he doesnt understand LCM. System needs to first dissect a learner to understand what he needs to learn and how he learns best and then offer the most effective learning intervention. That brings me to the last point.<p>3. Learning intervention: How do we find the right intervention for the student. There are lots of learning content online. Lots of curated content also available. But finding the content that suits me is a painstaking process. I have to keep trying till I find the right content.<p>I hope you guys find this useful. \nYou can reach me at @aakashbarot if I can be of any help further.",1379141419

They don&#x27;t always turn up when you request them because the human drivers have motivations of their own.

Validating/upgrading firmware. Installing a minimalist kernel. Securing BIOS and IPMI. Taking an inventory of part numbers and identities to detect tampering at later stages. Locking down network access on the switch to the appropriate MAC address. Determining administrative access methodology and distributing appropriate keys or credentials. Testing.<p>Probably most servers today are automatically set up, and live in large scale server farms. They probably boot via PXE, using custom auto-provisioning code. Other than physically taking delivery of the unit and inspecting it and logging its presence in inventory, such machines are literally just plugged in and boot up. Probably most of them are preconfigured to PXE boot by the vendor.

6384870,comment,6384154,6384154,2,0,orionblastar,,,"I agree there is sexism in the STEM fields, not all organizations and not all men, but it does exist.<p>Pax&#x27;s comments sort of have a sexist tone to them, and I guess he was trying to joke or troll. One can say they are misogynist to an extent as well.<p>I don&#x27;t really see the value in a titstate or jerkoffmeter, it sounds like the sort of app that Reddit or 4Chan would make. I suppose someone has to make those sorts of apps for the &#x27;Frat Boys&#x27; out there or immature men to use as jokes, but usually you don&#x27;t give a demo of them to the public at a meeting with women and young girls present because it has male oriented adult themes border-lining on porn. To be quite honest most demos are not screened before they are given, so you never know if one comes up. This is why porno magazines are always behind the counter of a gas-station and then covered up so under aged customers and people who object to them cannot see them. It is just common decency.<p>I think the bigger issue here is how to hire women who have talent, skills, and experience in the STEM field for STEM careers and how to attract them to your organization to hire them. Doing stuff like Pax did just drives them away. Some organizations just hire women based on their looks, and then they end up with mostly untalented women who aren&#x27;t qualified for the job, but got hired to avoid discrimination lawsuits of a low ration of STEM women employees. Eventually the talentless women get found out when they cannot even do the basics of their job, and then management moves them to something they can do, like a blogger and write the blogs as a technical evangelist.<p>My sister has to deal with this, she knows over 7 different programming languages and has a lot of talent. The talentless women harass her because they are jealous of her skills and abilities, call her tomboy, lesbian and other names. This sort of thing is not blogged about, and these sort of women are turning into social bullies. Most of them lack any STEM talent at all, and are in it just for the larger paychecks instead of learning new skills and developing great innovations like my sister does. Men bully due to their egos, but women on the other hand, bully for different reasons.<p>It is sad because some women who make it to the top, use a &#x27;rope ladder&#x27; my sister claims, and then they pull the rope ladder up with them so no other woman can climb, and then they sabotage other women so they won&#x27;t find success and it hurts their organization. Again even that is not blogged about either.<p>My sister is a humanist, she is for equal rights for everyone. She claims feminists only support women, and want women to become superior to everyone else. That radical feminism took over in the 1960&#x27;s, and as a result told women not to take STEM classes or rolls because men will just cut them down and are all pigs. That this modern age is a humanist movement, and feminists seem threatened by that. Feminists attack humanists and atheists because they want equality for all. The feminists keep citing examples like Pax, for the real reason why more women don&#x27;t take on more STEM classes and careers, but Pax is in the minority of men and feminists keep making excuses to cover up that they are the main people telling women to drop out of STEM classes and careers by painting all men as pigs and apes by citing a single example like Pax, and then say all men are like that and &#x27;we need to talk&#x27;. But no, not all men are like that and it is unfair to keep saying that.<p>Feminists, some of them seem to suffer from a form of  misogyny and won&#x27;t admit to it. That needs to be blogged about as well. But nobody is brave enough to do that.<p>I would like to encourage women to take STEM classes and pursue STEM roles. To develop that talent, skills, experience and become like my sister and don&#x27;t let some name calling and bad examples drive you from where STEM can take you. <a href=""http://www.iseek.org/careers/womenstem.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.iseek.org/careers/womenstem.html</a>",1379139963

6384855,comment,6383038,6384029,24,0,Moto7451,,,"Apologies in advance, this will be part reply to your comment, part reply to the Cracked articles, and part rambling:<p>Seconded. I was very poor twice in my life. First while growing up, and then for a few years after the downturn (19-23 years old) where I was making 13K-17K per year (post tax/credits, benefits included), working full time, and putting myself through school. I had no financial aid due to having no contact with my parents (a corner case that is poorly handled by the government, try getting anything except loans without a FAFSA). Until two and a half years ago I probably spent only three or four years where I wasn&#x27;t poor by any standard.<p>Poverty is definitely something you need to live through to really understand. You can have compassion, commiserate, etc but not a true comprehension unless you&#x27;ve been there. Even then, I know there are levels of poverty I have no understanding of. One I personally experienced was trying to get some help at a free clinic and being denied because I wasn&#x27;t quite poor enough to qualify. I believe I needed to have a dependent of some kind at my income level. Living through that is something I can&#x27;t fathom.<p>Moving is definitely an interesting game. Most of the time I was poor as an adult I lived in a retail store front (that couldn&#x27;t be rented out, leaky roof, boarded up windows) for $300/month. When I started doing well enough (making more than 20K) to consider an apartment, I went in with three friends because the cost to just get into a place in LA is typically, at minimum, $2000. The lower rent apartments want first, last and deposit, while more expensive apartments just want first and deposit. It&#x27;s basically impossible to save up 1/10th of your gross yearly income, and it&#x27;s not like the money is guaranteed to come back to you.<p>Since you&#x27;re in a bad spot, and the landlord knows it - otherwise you wouldn&#x27;t be one of three people in a $1400/month two bedroom apartment, they will play games with you. We had broken plumbing that went unfixed. None of us saw our deposits back. The management company literally pulled down websites as I found phone numbers for people in their offices. For a brief, albeit melodramatic, moment I felt like the protagonist in a man v.s. the oppressive company/government/world movie where I had just caught them and they were trying to pull the curtains over their wrongdoing.<p>Since I was still working insane hours and going to school, the couple hundred dollars weren&#x27;t something I could chase after... which is really the sad thing. They knew I couldn&#x27;t afford to do anything about it. Being inexperienced doesn&#x27;t help. Yes I could have gone to the city, but I didn&#x27;t know that back then, and when everyone around you is in the same place, you&#x27;re often times short on experience. (I&#x27;ve since launched complaints after the fact - I&#x27;m not the first this has happened to ;). It&#x27;s in the city&#x27;s hands at this point)<p>Now that I&#x27;m doing a lot better, the Cracked articles really hit home. My personal poor habits from those articles is limiting myself to two/three pairs of pants and the paranoid bank account check habit. Even though I typically keep my expenses at half or less of my wages and I know the money is there, I won&#x27;t sleep that night if I don&#x27;t check my accounts every few days. When I was poor the next disaster seemed to be right around the corner. It&#x27;s really hard to shake that instinct.<p>Being able to really live has been very interesting. I&#x27;ve tried to do as much traveling as I can, something I could never do before. I find myself weighing every permutation of airfare (travel dates, airlines, buying separate round trips for multi city trips), just like I used to do once upon a time when figuring out how to buy a month&#x27;s worth of groceries in $60.<p>That said, I&#x27;m not immune to doing bad emotional math. I just got a bonus today and the same thought process ran though my head when I saw the amount deposited into my account. It&#x27;s hard not to. In fact, musing about it is enjoyable. Much more than being rational about it. Money brings out all sorts of emotions.<p>The problem I have with it is that I like roads, police officers, and all those expensive &quot;leach-feeding&quot; social programs I used to be a customer of; so I quell my irrational anger pretty quickly. Without inexpensive Community College courses I wouldn&#x27;t have gotten the necessary education or the connection I used to get my first paid internship ($15/hour almost double my previous job) which turned into my career.<p>Like the Cracked author mentions, yes there are terribly abuses of the money... but I believe the good outweighs the bad.<p>I don&#x27;t see any problem with paying that forward. I&#x27;m certainly not suffering doing it, even if I occasionally shake my fist at those &quot;Tax and Spend Commies in Congress&quot; for an irrational split second. In a couple years, with some luck and hard work, I&#x27;ll be making closer to the amount that poor unhappy retired couple from the WSJ graphic was making[1]... all the while dealing with my &quot;poor kid from North Hollywood&quot; mentality.<p>[1]<a href=""http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424127887323689604578220132665726040.html#project%3DWEALTH0105%26articleTabs%3Dinteractive"" rel=""nofollow"">http://online.wsj.com/article/SB1000142412788732368960457822...</a>",1379139586

I can see some women just taking random photos of men they don&#x27;t like and reporting them, and there is no appeal process. Also some men who look like other men will get a bad reputation. If a man wants to do something violent to a woman, this app won&#x27;t prevent it.

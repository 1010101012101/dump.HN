Most mutual funds essentially act like ETFs as a lot of them are focused on relative performance and not absolute performance. You should read the beginning chapters of Margin of Safety (if you can find the book) as it really helps to explain the mindset of a MF. To reduce expenses for active funds further will only exacerbate this.<p>If you want to outperform the market, however, you need to find a GREAT hedge fund that charges 1% management fee (at most) and an incentive fee...otherwise it doesn&#x27;t make sense to pay a flat fee to a MF and get just average performance.

But lawyers do specialize in this type of case at the city/state level, and it wouldn&#x27;t surprise me if there is a &quot;standard settlement&quot; scale that says what % of annual salary the employer is willing to pay to make the case go away (I know this exists for auto insurance cases because I used to have a client who was a stereotypical ambulance chaser).<p>But generally you&#x27;re right -- when you sue someone, only the lawyers win. At a minimum, a cursory background check would turn up the lawsuit and potentially damage your chances at getting another job. It&#x27;s the same as with whistleblower cases: you have to ask yourself if the injustice you&#x27;re trying to correct is so big that it&#x27;s worth potentially destroying your career (whistleblower laws promise huge rewards for exposing behavior but they can be very difficult to collect on and generally make you unhireable).<p>That said, if a specific company (like Amazon/Google are rumored to do) routinely does things like this, they could face a class action suit. Class action suits are a company&#x27;s worst nightmare because they are run by the lawyers -- who have every incentive to be as public as possible about the proceedings. Dragging a company&#x27;s name though the mud in the media is a good way to get them to settle on your terms, and the former employees aren&#x27;t at the forefront of the case so there&#x27;s little downside to it. It actually wouldn&#x27;t surprise me if we see a class action suit come out of this; this kind of treatment is common enough in the tech industry and there&#x27;s a lot of money on the table if a law firm can put together a case. But again, in a class action suit the lawyers keep most of the money, so ultimately they&#x27;re the biggest winners.",1440683702

I think this is a positive and<p>2) that stop order should almost never be used.  During the crash of 1987 stop orders were just coming into vogue as a sort of protection.  The ides with them is that they are sell or buy orders that are in the money but not entered onto the CLOB(Continuous limit order book).  Once the stock falls below their strike price, they spring into action and become orders to sell (or buy if you are stopping for short protection).<p>This has a downside of extending slides when markets go down because as markets fall stops get hit which adds to the selling which means more stops get hit, rinse and repeat.<p>Unfortunately this means that in a flash crash you&#x27;ll get stopped out of your position and when the market recovers you&#x27;ll wonder where your shares went.<p>Stop orders, just say no.

There are still very good grapplers with the last name Gracie of course, but the whole &#x27;worship us for we brought the light&#x27; (e.g. the &#x27;Rickson is 400-0&#x27; spiel, &#x27;we perfected JJ for 60 years&#x27; (yeah and then it took 2 years to break it, so what?) ) is undeserved. Even in UFC5 Royce had a hard time with Ken, Royce was broken after 36 mins but Ken came out smiling.<p>The thing with Americans is (saying this as a European, and as as someone who&#x27;s generally abhorred by the low kickboxing skills in the US) that they&#x27;re so pragmatic, and that that is much more to credit for the amazing development of MMA than the basics the Gracies brought in the 1990&#x27;s (although it cannot be assigned to one person of course, so it&#x27;s much more difficult to build a Hero story around it). Look at how much the techniques, the training, the professionalism, everything has improved since the early 2000&#x27;s, when people like Tank Abbott or Kimo actually were top level fighters. As soon as MMA took off in the US, it was all about &#x27;what wins the fights&#x27;. Whereas in Japan, and here in Europe as well, things were (are?) much more about &#x27;bushido&#x27; and &#x27;following what we&#x27;ve alway done&#x27; and all that nonsense which keeps people from improving. As late as 2007 or 2009, there were many &#x27;MMA fights&#x27; (which were usually just sideshows during kickboxing events...) where any blue belt BJJ player could step into the ring and win pretty much any fight in <30 seconds, because nobody had a clue about takedown defenses. The same way I submitted a judo black belt once in < 30s with a straight ankle lock because judo players don&#x27;t generally even know about leg locks. (Of course after I got him once, he didn&#x27;t fall for the same setup any more, and went on to destroy me in 50 different ways - not saying I&#x27;m such a great fighter here).<p>Again not sure where I&#x27;m going with this and my comment reads like a Sherdog post of the type that made me leave that site years ago, so I&#x27;ll just stop :)",1440683544

10129307,comment,10126805,10127948,0,0,rprospero,,,"Perhaps a bit of a different viewpoint, but one of the reasons that I keep coming back to Haskell is that it lets me refactor things things that I can&#x27;t in other languages.  Take the following C code:<p><pre><code>    char* response(messy* message) {
      body* b = message->body;
      if(b==NULL) {
        return NULL;}
      char** lines = b->text;
      if(t==NULL) {
        return NULL;
      }
      if(b->line_count < 11) {
        return NULL;
      }
      return t[10];
    }
</code></pre>
Writing all of those if statements grows tedious.  A lazier programmer could just drop them, but then the program would crash whenever the program received malformed data.<p>With Hackell, though, I can refactor out the if statements and get the following equivalent code:<p><pre><code>    response :: Messy -> Maybe String
    response message = do
      b <- body message
      lines <- text body
      lines `atMay` 10
</code></pre>
I want to be clear on a couple of points.  First, the Haskell code performs all of the same &quot;null&quot; and bounds checks that the C code made, so this is an apples-to-apples comparison.  Furthermore, this isn&#x27;t using exceptions, like a similar piece of C++ code might try.  There&#x27;s no stack unwinding and nothing can escape to contaminate the rest of your program.  Finally, this isn&#x27;t just a weird special case built into the language.  With a minimal amount of effort, I could have each failure return a unique error Code.<p><pre><code>    errorCode :: Maybe a -> b -> Either b a
    errorCode (Just value) _ = Right value
    errorCode Nothing code = Left code

    response :: Messy -> Either Int String
    response message = do
      b <- body message `errorCode` 1
      lines <- text body `errorCode` 2
      (lines `atMay` 10) `errorCode` 3
</code></pre>
I don&#x27;t know a way of doing that in any of the C style languages.  In those languages, you&#x27;re forced to add in another if statement every time your code touches message->body to ensure that you&#x27;re not going to segfault.  With Haskell, I can refactor away those if statements and I don&#x27;t have that code being duplicated all throughout my project.<p>EDIT: improved readability of errorCode",1440683255

This kind of thing is extremely dependent on culture. If you take an American with high emotional intelligence and plant them in Finland, they aren&#x27;t necessarily going to be able to read people the same way. It&#x27;s hard to imagine a case where this kind of thing isn&#x27;t a learned ability.<p>It&#x27;s like saying men are better at Algebra. Most people are capable of being perfect at Algebra with the right training and focus. It&#x27;s just a matter of moving numbers around in a very predictable way. Responding to people&#x27;s emotional cues is similarly something trainable, but because it&#x27;s cultural and more difficult to define precisely (and what isn&#x27;t less precise than math?), it tends to acquire a more mystical aura and lends itself to being defined as something gender specific when that might not really be the case at all. Maybe it really is, but we have no hard evidence either way, and any statistics about it have a high probability of being culturally biased.<p>In the long run, I don&#x27;t think that training new generations of people to respond to emotions will be any more effective than recording successful interactions and using the data to train computers to do the same thing. With a large enough data set, a good enough algorithm that can vary tone of voice in response to emotional cues is going to be more consistent than a large workforce doing the same thing. With humans, you&#x27;ll get more exceptional talents, but you&#x27;ll also get more really awful people, and with the state of the Internet, just one awful customer service experience can go viral and ruin a company&#x27;s reputation. Even if computers aren&#x27;t as good as the most exceptional people at responding to emotions, I think the jobs will tend toward the computers there too for the sake of protecting against those few employees who aren&#x27;t good, don&#x27;t care, or are just having a bad day and take it out on customers. There will still be high-end services where people care about being served by people, but for commodity customer service, computers will win within a few decades (and this applies to managing employees too, particularly in situations like scheduling, but I think middle management will be slower to switch for cultural reasons, since managers actually have some control over keeping their jobs).",1440682932

Running a store, developing a phone, building a house, designing a rocket to go to the moon, it&#x27;s all the same thing according to them. Getting info, negotiate, motivate a team, giving speeches, running projects, ... Some go further in this, and some hold up the idea that something like &quot;management science&quot; exists.<p>This directly leads to the second ridiculous belief, which causes a feedback loop : that they can hire other managers anywhere, absolutely no concern for what they did before, as long as they had slightly less &quot;reports&quot; (so they are &quot;promoted&quot; into their new position), for any management function.<p>Then, of course the second belief leads to negotiation, to trading business efforts for jobs. If you make my department look good (internally &quot;hire&quot; us as consultants because your financial performance is down the crapper anyway and we&#x27;ll hire you next quarter after your division gets nixed).

Companies are (were) started by mechanics, by engineers, by traders (ie. shop attendants), by software developers, sometimes by experienced investors, by ... The best companies were started by people who had the skills to do well in 2 different fields. Generally what happens is that at some point a deep and explosive conflict happens between these founders and some employees of their companies, and then someone is brought in to prevent this. In reality, this is normal. Meet enough people, raise the stakes high enough and you will clash very seriously with other people. And the bigger your company gets as a founder, the more is at stake, and the more people you will have to deal with. So a conflict escalating is a matter of time, but it is human nature to compensate : founders will bring in a manager to deal with this sort of thing, and then the job trading begins. As everybody who&#x27;s held a job at a large company knows, this does not prevent personality clashes, quite the opposite, but once this position trading starts, it is incredibly hard to stop.",1440682927

I don&#x27;t support the erosion of privacy, so it would be hypocritical of me to tar anyone with this brush, let alone everyone. Much of my family for instance believes in the &quot;I&#x27;ve got nothing to hide, so I have nothing to fear&quot; argument, but my perspective is &quot;neither did the Jews before Hitler&quot;.<p>> Some people, rightly, hold themselves and others to higher standards.<p>You cannot control the actions of everyone else, only yourself. Others will do what inspires them. What inspires them may or may not align with what inspires you. When it doesn&#x27;t, expecting them to abide by the rules you hold dear is only setting yourself up for disappointment.<p>> People even abide by the rules<p>Yes, when it serves their purpose. When it doesn&#x27;t, they either break the rules publicly, demonstrate to get the rules changed or break them privately to avoid judgment or being ostracized by partners, family, their community and hope like hell they don&#x27;t get caught.<p>Lines are drawn regarding all kinds of things. Let&#x27;s take just for the argument&#x27;s sake, speeding, or smoking marijuana, never downloading music or movies illegally - things that we can all agree, there are rules about, rules that (currently) define these activities as prohibited in many jurisdictions. Even though there are rules, and many people may argue they&#x27;re dumb rules about benign activities, there <i>are</i> still rules. Many break the rules publicly, voicing their defiance; many others break them privately and hope they don&#x27;t get caught. I&#x27;d say given your stance you never break any rules - even rules you consider dumb or counter to your own set of beliefs or don&#x27;t align with your interests; you always abide by the rules and you always fall in line with the wishes of your neighbour. Of course you don&#x27;t, nobody does. It&#x27;s human nature to question the rules and to find loopholes, and to bend them and/or break them when they don&#x27;t align with our interests. These rules, which <i>are</i> defined for the good of the masses, to maintain the status quo. But what happens when what&#x27;s good for the masses doesn&#x27;t align with what&#x27;s good for you? Do you put everyone else first or do you put yourself first? You put yourself first, you hope like hell you don&#x27;t get caught or called out; or you hope if you <i>do</i> get caught you get away with a slap on the wrist or that a reasonably competent lawyer could fight your case in court and help you avoid the charges.<p>For me to believe that you strictly abide by all the rules, without questioning human nature, and without understanding your set of circumstances, would be incredibly naive. There are many reasons people break the law, it&#x27;s not always cut and dry nor black and white. Most of the time it&#x27;s incredibly grey - to the point that billions of dollars every year are spent on lawyers to argue to put people in jail or keep people out of jail based on legal technicalities, loop holes and precedence set by previous circumstances; because <i>nothing</i> is black and white. If it <i>were</i> then <i>anyone</i> could go to court and defend themselves and no more lawyers would be required.<p>Some of those revered as the greatest people on earth shunned the rules to invoke great change. Some canonized as saints after the fact, but in their time considered rebels, misfits and, in some cases, criminals: Rosa Parks, Bob Dylan, Mahatma Ghandi, Einstein, Martin Luther King Jr., John Lennon, the lone protester at Tiananmen Square, Nelson Mandela, heck, even <i>Jesus Christ</i> - the son of man, shunned the rules and defied the status quo because of their beliefs - and many believe their rule breaking changed the world for the better.",1440682446

At any given price, at any given time, in an order book you can have more buyers at a price than sellers (or vice versa).  How do you decide tie breakers?  One common way is to do FIFO matching, this means that the participant that had an order in the longest gets filled before someone who had one in a shorter amount of time.  The higher your time resolution the less viable this gets.<p>Second, there is also a desire to get OUT of the market.  So as you process new information you realize that your current orders are riskier than you anticipated, so you want to cancel them.  The longer it takes you to cancel them the more risk you are exposed to.  In the case of market makers this risk will get passed on to their customers in the form of higher spreads and less liquidity.<p>Third, there is no 1 place where trading happens.  Trading happens in hundreds of venues around the world in just as many jurisdictions.

Violence was less of an option because the British government deliberately ensured that the locals were suppressed. Whereas in the U.S. the British were exploitative of the colonies, but they did not suppress the people (until the movement started); after all, those were their own people.<p>We did, in fact, have a violent movement,  in 1857, just that it didn&#x27;t work out too well.<p>I don&#x27;t think that &quot;Indians are less violent&quot; is really an argument to be made here.",1440680746

The Palacio itself is a gorgeous museum and theatre with a world famous folkloric dance company, too.<p>The 1999 movie Cradle Will Rock contains a retelling of the story of the mural and delicious visuals.<p>Of course Lenin was nasty and evil and Rivera&#x27;s politics were awful. Wise people don&#x27;t judge art by its creators&#x27; politics and personal lives. Rivera&#x27;s sense of progress, science, and respect for both the past and the joys of the machine age shine through the bad politics of the day to make this a brilliant piece in spite of its flaws.<p>(One of the flaws is that the Palacio isn&#x27;t designed for a mural and therefore has giant gorgeous marble columns impeding any view of the whole work at once; just step up close and enjoy it in pieces.)",1440680716

How many people in the mainstream media are talking about the underrepresention of women among Fields Medalists? The vast amount of attention is focused on jobs where the distribution of genius-level IQs,[1] is not relevant: programmers, CEOs, business executives, etc.<p>And speaking of Summers, it&#x27;s hilarious how people will cite him while ignoring his underlying point about aptitude distribution. Almost 40% of kids who have a 700+ math SAT are girls. Using Summers&#x27; reasoning we should see a lot more women in programming and engineering.<p>[1] This is leaving aside findings subsequent to Summers&#x27; comments that over time the disparity between men and women in IQ scores is narrowing.",1440680446

To be completely honest, it&#x27;s simply wrong to describe BJJ as such. Brutal is the last word I would use to describe it.<p>Jiu-jitsu lends itself much more to the preservation of the health of both combatants in a self-defense or sport scenario as compared to other martial arts. Certainly more so than striking based systems. I would argue that the main focus of any jiu-jitsu practitioner is to end the fight via choke. Look at sport jiu jitsu such as the ADCC or IBJJF. They aren&#x27;t gladiatorial. The injuries suffered in these contests are as severe as those in any non-combat sport such as soccer or baseball.<p>MMA on the other hand is by definition violent. The connection between MMA and BJJ is of course undeniable; the fathers of modern MMA are the children of the father of BJJ. However, they are VASTLY different things.",1440680431

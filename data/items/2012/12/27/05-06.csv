4972507,comment,4971002,4971002,2,0,thepainfultruth,,,"""capable of doing virtually everything Thunderbird, etc. can -- and in some cases more""<p>Dude, just no. Don't be one of those founders. Don't get drunk off your own Koolaid. I'm a heavy daily thunderbird user with 10 accounts and at this point in time, with this release, Thunderbird literally does everything better than Inky. Everything. From account setup, to available options, to information density, plugins, sorting collumn options, UI and collumn flexibility, customization, massive options, and about 35 other things. Email is broken not because it isn't pretty, it's broken because there's too much email, too much spam, and a lack of good threading. Common let's be honest, you made email pretty. You mac-afied it. Took out Spam filter and replaced it with Relevant/Not Relevant.<p>Your design, name, logo, URL are amazing.<p>However, Inky couldn't connect to my custom domain inboxes like support@mywebsitename.com and hangs on the ""discover settings"" page even after I specify the pop and smtp settings. Gmail works fine though. I'm sure you'll fix that quick so I'm not judging you on it.<p>Also, Inky has a bad case of the ""looks over functionality"" flu and ""hide everything off the screen and call it minimalization"" disease that's been going around. Information density is really low. Every message takes up too much space. With thunderbird my inbox fills up my whole monitor and I could skim through my entire inbox in 15 seconds. With Inky every little message takes up so much visual room it takes forever to check my mail. And everything takes more clicks than usual to complete. And clickable icons like checkboxes etc... are too small.<p>Not to mention, where is the spam button?<p>If you sing on your own merrits you'll always find fans, but when you compare yourself to Whitney Houston you're just asking for a backlash. Likewise, had you not compared Inky to Thunderbird you would have been fine.",1356587223

Your heart sinks...</i><p>I'm always happy to hear that a company values their employees, and takes a proactive approach to keep them happy.  I'm also surprised how little some companies do on that same front, and only scramble to analyze pay, work conditions, etc. <i>after</i> an employee has announced they're leaving.  By then it's too late.<p>One case that sticks out for me was a few years back when a brilliant lead dev I know left the company he was working for.  I knew the company's work conditions weren't favorable, he didn't have a job title worthy of what he was doing day to day, and after hearing the salary he was being paid (about half a typical market-rate salary at the time), my only question was why he hadn't left earlier.<p>So I think a lot of companies encourage their employees to leave without even knowing it.  Or even worse, they know they're shortchanging them on some level and gamble on fear or ignorance in hopes that said employees feel they're getting a fair deal.  I believe this to be the case with the example I cited above, and am glad the lead dev has since found a company with much better work conditions across the board.",1356586940

In that sense libertarianism isn't arbitrary because there's a goal that can be reasonably observed. Whether it's is a worthy goal is up for debate.<p>a) To a libertarian, force is bad for the same reasons rape and slavery is bad. It violates the preference of individuals by means of agression.<p>With that said, what principle do you hold that says rape or slavery is bad? Do you believe those principles are idealistic or unreasonable? Would you be willing to compromise those principles for 'the greater good' or some other abstract notion?<p>b) Who decides what's considered force? Typically the individuals involved. How do you decide if you're being raped? Do you call your congressman and ask if forceful sex is legal? If rape were legal, would rape cease to exist? If rape were socially acceptable, would it still be rape? Most libertarians would say yes because the ethics of action is not relative to legality.<p>If someone chose not to have insurance, they don't have the right to force you to pay their bill. You can just let them die. Like we're letting people of other poor countries die this second.<p>Now, I won't pretend that I have a formula for deducing whether an action is agressive -- but that doesn't make it less real. So why do you see libertarianism as a disease? Do you have a more consistent philosophy? Is there a specific idea that libertarians hold that is offensive?",1356584769

Those atrocities rivaled the Nazi's and they didn't have the excuse of antisemitism, they were just terrible people, for example: gang rape to death was the norm for a Chinese woman under Japanese occupation. (Read up on it sometime you <i>will</i> be traumatized but it's worth it)\nOnly the Italians can excuse themselves as not being any worse than anyone else in Europe at the time, who also handed over all their Jews to Germany for extermination.<p>To all those people who are claiming that only the leadership is to blame for the Holocaust, it takes a lot of man-power and planning to transport and kill 11 million civilians, this wasn't done by a small minority of the German Army or SS, even if the camps were administered by only SS, rounding up the people and stuffing them in cattle cars takes a lot of man-power.",1356584737

Apple reserves the use of this convention. Use by third parties could result in name-space collisions; they might unwittingly override an existing private method with one of their own, with disastrous consequences.

The Groupon's of the World are too labour intensive, and will keep the op costs very high.  You can't keep posting quality deals without someone having that conversation with the vendor.  As long as that's the model, the costs are going to be too high, and far from profitable.  The market is properly reacting to their business cycle.  Living Social the same.",1356584696

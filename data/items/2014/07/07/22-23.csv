Worse, some of them can even get votes by peddling the myth that the poor are the ones responsible for bleeding the working class dry. This is often accompanied by a &quot;fix&quot; that costs more than it saves, makes life even harder for those at the bottom, and sometimes even funnels money back into the party / official&#x27;s pocket (e.g. the urine test performed by a company owned by the official&#x27;s wife).<p>It&#x27;s voters that need to change, not social workers.",1404773970

8002089,comment,8001337,8001337,77,0,candeira,,,"I work at Monash University in Melbourne, Australia. Last year we moved our foundational course in data structures and algorithms from Java to Python, with great success. This is a course that used to be taught in C, then moved to Java. I tutored it as a Java course, and was in charge of adapting the tutorial (classroom exercises) and laboratory (programming assignments) materials when we started using Python to teach the unit.<p>The main content of the course hasn&#x27;t changed. Complexity, Big O notation, sorting and searching are introduced in the first two or three weeks. Students work through the usual implementations of arrays, linked lists, stacks and queues (both array and linked-list based), trees, heaps, tries, etc. All these data structures are explained first as chunks of data with external functions for the operations; then a second time as objects with methods for operations, once object orientation is introduced in week 5 or 6. Iterators are introduced as an abstract interface to list-, array- and tree- walking. Where relevant, we explain every operation twice, showing the iterative and recursive approaches. The course ends with two weeks of lower level work, where the students hand-compile pseudo-Python to working MIPS assembly.<p>The move to Python gained us, among other things, the freedom not to have to explain Java&#x27;s generics and access modifiers. Many of our students have never programmed with a text editor before our unit, and dropping them into the big boilerplate world of Java micro-management was not good for them or for the course. We used to spend too much time on syntax and other details (&quot;native types are like this, reference types are like htat&quot;) that we should have been spending on data structures and algorithms.<p>With Python, we even have time to explain idiomatic Python iterators and generators, and to discuss Python scoping rules (which come up again when we work on local variables in their hand-compilation tasks). So we still teach a bit of language-specifics, but we don&#x27;t feel we are shackled to have to teach them. Also, teaching them idiomatic Python is a good deed after spending the first three or four weeks in a not very idiomatic subset of Python where we maintain explicit indices, update them by incrementing or decrementing them manually, use while loops the condition checking on the index value, etc. as required by the course content.<p>I don&#x27;t have data on the results, because I was only the adjunct adapting the tutorial materials. The only difference I noticed was that students had less support from their IDE, and that some common errors (attempting to access attributes on None is the top one) that used to be picked up statically are now runtime errors, as expected. There didn&#x27;t seem to be any big problems from Python&#x27;s lack of lexical typing. Type errors are still caught, again by the runtime instead of the IDE and, if anything, this is a better exercise for students, since fixing them requires better understanding of what the program is doing.<p>If anyone is interested, I can ask the lecturer about the outcomes, but just from the fact that neither she nor anybody else teaching the unit has raised any issues the second and third times the unit was taught I can tell it&#x27;s all going smoothly.",1404773902

8002082,comment,8001337,8001994,2,0,Alupis,,,"Well, yes, sure... core programming concepts are the same regardless of language used and/or version.<p>However, from my experience, most students don&#x27;t venture off on their own until after becoming very familiar with a language. Not all students are experimental enough to hack on personal projects for fun or what-have-you. I&#x27;ve actually had a fellow student tell me the Java class file he emailed me for a project would only run on Java 6 since that&#x27;s what the lab had installed -- obviously wrong.<p>The point being -- students will intern what they are taught. They should be taught on modern versions/concepts so they intern modern ways of doing things. By teaching Python 2.x to students, you do them a disservice by teaching them the way Python &quot;used to&quot; do it... not how it &quot;does it&quot; now.<p>As an aside -- with all of the major Python libraries now ported to 3.x -- I see little to no reason anyone should ever learn Python 2.x, or use it (with the exception of the obvious legacy codebase support issue).",1404773817

8002061,comment,8001337,8001770,5,0,jarrett,,,"My take on Ruby vs Python is this:<p>While Python has a healthy web dev ecosystem, Ruby&#x27;s feels much larger to me.

So for web dev, I would consider Ruby the winner.<p>Python is the clear winner for scientific computing. That&#x27;s not really due to anything\ninherent in the language. It&#x27;s an ecosystem thing. If you were using Fortran before,\nyou might be working in a problem domain where Python dominates.<p>Both are excellent for miscellaneous scripting work. E.g. reading in a CSV file and doing something with each row; batch-processing a bunch of images; renaming 1000 files according to some ruleset; gathering some system data and sending nightly status emails.<p>In terms of syntax and features, they&#x27;re very very similar. Python has meaningful\nwhitespace, which you may like or dislike. (I think it&#x27;s good for enforcing proper\nformatting, but you&#x27;re free to disagree.) Ruby has multiple ways of expressing the\nmathematical concept of a function (methods, blocks, and procs), which has its pros and\ncons.

Yes, Hypercard was dead simple to get something useful actually working, but nobody would accept a web app that looked and behaved like a Hypercard app.<p>I think the author is right: there is a none-to-healthy culture of increasing complexity surrounding web development. But there is also a large amount of real complexity around it. Many of the complexities we deal with today are the result of attempting to put an abstraction layer over deeper, larger complexities. Unfortunately, few abstraction layers work without leaks, and those leaks add their own complexity.<p>With powerful browsers, APIs-as-a-service and single-page apps, we are almost to a point where the web itself has been abstracted. But, even with that, expectations are still incredibly high. Nobody wants to look at blocky, course web sites; they want beautiful, smoothly animated sites. And that takes complexity.",1404773365

And if you want one to remain within that distance, you need a bunch in completely different orbits, launched at different times, to maintain coverage.

And then there are domains, like climate science, economics, political forecasting, genetics, sociology, etc., where the underlying phenomena are very complex, data are noisy, and quite a wide range of models can be made to fit the available data. The latter sort of situation is becoming more and more common, as machine learning and statistical modeling are increasingly being applied to human behavior and other such messy areas that fall well outside the realm of &#x27;clean&#x27; physical laws. So I submit that subjective model choice is, in practice, a very important part of a statistician / scientist&#x27;s art.

The government used to be able to spur all sorts of economic gains that way, from huge dams generating cheap electricity to the interstate highway system. Now we vaporize $800 billion (ARRA stimulus program) and barely get anything for it.<p>The only thing in this category the government seems to be able to afford these days (other than lots of wasted military spending), is scientific research funding.<p>Another huge difference is that America has taken on truly massive liabilities, from public debt to entitlements, that did not exist in 1948. Those entitlement obligations alone will squeeze the government&#x27;s budget to death over the next 20 years. That leaves a lot less money for everything else.<p>As an economic burden, healthcare has become a huge portion of the economy and government spending compared to 1948, and will remain substantial no matter how they cut and squeeze costs in the coming years. That money can&#x27;t be spent on bridges, roads, electrical grids, research, etc. It also doesn&#x27;t help that Americans overall have been much less healthy in terms of diet in the last 50 or 60 years, contributing substantially to that increase in healthcare costs (helped by the government subsidizing things like sugar and corn, and promoting really stupid food pyramids).",1404772240

I&#x27;m not sure what other similar places do, but CMU splits introductory courses into 2 parts - 110, 112. 110 is the basic programming with gradual intro to OOP and stuff. 112 is where the datastructures come in - it&#x27;s a programming primer to implementing datastructures and algorithms, so to speak.<p>Here is the issue I feel goes unnoticed as most people place out of 110 and never take it - CMU moved both courses to Python. While this helped 110 in a way by making it more accessible, it also resulted in people getting out of 110 with far less OOP principles than they did before. On the other hand, python works great in 112 because you spend more time building datastructures rather than running into the wall with Java OOP layers over and over. It&#x27;s also cleaner so how a datastructure works becomes more transparent. But since the curriculum assumes OOP mastery from that point on, with no software engineering course required - I always wonder if replacing Java from 110 (a course for people with no coding background) was a mistake.<p>They put the transition to vote and Python won very clearly. But I always wished they continued 110 in Java (or shifted to Scheme, or anything that follows a stricter regime than python - so one gets comfortable with one way of abstracting problems, be it OOP or Functional) and taught 112 with Python. It probably isn&#x27;t worth even discussing given how few CS majors take the course, but it always makes me wonder why we needed same language for both courses.",1404772175

Targeting particular attack vectors is of course less than ideal, but if one receives a credible tip along the lines of &#x27;agent X will attempt to transport a &#x27;battery bomb&#x27; onto a US bound flight this month&#x27; then you can&#x27;t blame security services for trying to leverage that information.

As for Guantanamo bay, I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s an appropriate comparison. Most people held there were either captured in Afghanistan and a few kidnapped and subjected to &#x27;extraordinary rendition&#x27;, of them in the context of a hot war. I&#x27;m talking about people arrested on suspicion of terrorism, ie neither the Tsarnev guy in Boston nor any of the various would-be terrorists nabbed by the FBI over recent years have been sent to Guantanamo (despite calls for that some ultraconservatives).

Looking farther back, for several decades Britain dealt with its terrorism problem in Northern Ireland by removing the right to a jury trial for many offenses (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diplock_courts"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diplock_courts</a>) and for a number of years by internment (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Demetrius"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Demetrius</a> - note that almost 2000 people were held prisoner without trial, quite a few more than Guantanamo Bay ever held).<p>Now, I wouldn&#x27;t expect you to know all this - I grew up over there so it&#x27;s easy for me to cite examples.

I could dredge up a variety of examples from other countries in various stages of socioeconomic development, but since the UK shares a language and a common legal heritage with the US it seemed like the most obvious point of comparison. I stand by my argument that the US response to terrorism, while of questionable effectiveness, is not nearly as unusual as you seem to think. Indeed, in comparison with prior actions of the US it&#x27;s fairly mild, sad to say; consider the Japanese internment of WW2, or historical punitive campaigns that would be regarded as genocidal war crimes today, such as the Phillipine-American war of 1899-1902, or for that matter the Vietnam war.

So we don&#x27;t need everything to derive from Object in order to have vector<Object>.  There are definitely some areas where polymorphism is the most elegant solution/abstraction and the only place you have to be a little bit careful is around your performance bottlenecks.  What I mean is that if you&#x27;re looping through a bunch of objects and calling o->render() the actual virtual call will usually be minor vs. the work of rendering said object.  Also all these objects have a different implementation of render - right?  So I&#x27;m not sure what&#x27;s to inline (but I will read up your references).  If you&#x27;re AOT optimizing a scenario like this you&#x27;d probably want to separate out those objects and process them all in a group based on their type.  It&#x27;ll make your code suckier and less maintainable, you give up your nice abstraction, but faster.  This is something a compiler can&#x27;t do for you upfront because you would be essentially changing your design to get speed.<p>So honestly the performance of virtual functions in C++ isn&#x27;t something I&#x27;ve ever seen as a performance issue (which probably means my code isn&#x27;t very interesting ;-)",1404770830

People who tend to make the hiring and pay decisions are seldom those who understand the intricacies or value of good engineers. An engineer could make $500k a year, but the business case for why that is a good investment for the company has to be made, and that&#x27;s where it falls apart.<p>Most people capable of making that decision believe that somebody with a Harvard MBA is worth a particular sum because that&#x27;s what the market, their experience, their network, and conventional wisdom tells them. For that same person to believe that a top engineer with or without a strong pedigree is worth the same amount would require that person to understand a lot of details that few are willing to learn.<p>I don&#x27;t think this is necessarily a setback for all engineers- it just creates different but highly lucrative opportunities for those that are able to make the business case to those who write the checks. Instead of relying on your pedigree and the fact that the market at large widely agrees what certain pedigrees and jobs are worth a lot (which is what makes top schools and PE/IB jobs so competitive), you have to convince people of your value on your own.<p>Edit: To be less abstract- an example would be starting a tech consulting business in which you bill $200/hour. Not necessarily an easy task, but if you can show that you&#x27;re worth more than that to the business, you can convince them to pay you that much.",1404770592

8001787,comment,7999392,7999392,1,0,tgb,,,"> It&#x27;s also possible to allow tile rotation or mirroring. However, this complicates the nature of the edge constraint; with 90-degree rotation, the edge constraints on horizontals must be the same as the edge constraints on verticals. If mirroring (or 180-degree rotation) is allowed, the edge constraints must be internally symmetric. The advantage is that if rotation or mirroring are allowed, the minimum number of tiles needed decreases. (I haven&#x27;t done the math to explore how far it goes down; somebody should.)<p>Unless I&#x27;m mistaken, counting the number of tiles needed for a complete set when allowing rotations and reflections comes down to the classic necklace counting problem [1]. In particular, we have exactly 4 &#x27;beads&#x27; (i.e. edges in this case) and n colors (conveniently called colors in both theories). (Well, wikipedia&#x27;s notation actually would call these &#x27;bracelets&#x27; unless you didn&#x27;t include mirroring.) Wolfram Alpha [2] gives an enumeration of these numbers for the first few, namely:<p>2 colors : 6 tiles, 6 w/ mirrors<p>3 colors: 24 tiles, 21 w/ mirrors<p>4 colors: 70 tiles, 55 w/ mirrors<p>5 colors: 165 tiles, 119 w/ mirrors<p>(Disclaimer: I might have messed up the &quot;with mirrors&quot; numbers.)<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Necklace_(combinatorics)"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Necklace_(combinatorics)</a>\n[2] <a href=""http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=necklace+number"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=necklace+number</a>",1404770579

Most of the observed mining power continued mining through the first reward halving of Nov 2012. This is because miners have different operating costs. So the few that stopped mining actually caused a small difficulty drop (~10% IIRC), which made it a bit more profitable for those who continued mining, so the network stabilized at a slightly lower hashrate (before it continued increasing again in Jan-Feb 2013.)<p>This demonstrates that mining is an economically self-adjusting activity that can survive 50% drops in mining income. And the disappearance of the fixed reward in year ~2140 will NOT be an event where more than 50% of your mining income disappear overnight [2] so Bitcoin mining is economically viable forever, theoretically.<p>[1] <a href=""https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Controlled_supply"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Controlled_supply</a><p>[2] Fees currently average ~0.05 BTC/block. The fixed reward is 25 BTC/block today and decreases smoothly by halving every ~4 years, therefore it should reach 0.04882812 BTC by year ~2048 [1]. This means even assuming fees never grow beyond 0.05 BTC/block (eg. Bitcoin&#x27;s adoption stagnates), fees will already represent most of a miner&#x27;s income by year 2048. Subsequent reward halvings (0.04882812 BTC to 0.02441406 BTC in year ~2052, etc) will be insignificant compared to the income from fees. And the disappearance of fixed rewards in year 2140 will be an even less significant event. Fees will have already represented the majority of mining income for the previous ~100 years.",1404770575

358177,comment,358168,358168,0,0,jwilliams,,,"Great post! It points out up front that performance != scale.<p>The other scaling point is concurrency. You can't (for example) serially add features to a page. Eventually that page will simply take too long to render.<p>A lot of ""dashboard"" pages suffer from this problem. If you reach that stage you need to start thinking about decoupling features - using things like messaging.",1226216961

If you don't understand why it was important enough to the debian core team to bother with the effort of maintaining a forked version version of the browser; you are not able to comment intelligently on the topic.",1226216668

Most prefab home sites seem to just have pictures and a phone number, whereas she has detailed pricing and videos and testimony and talks a lot about sustainable design and self-sufficiency.<p>Her story sounds like a good one for the YC crowd too. She and her husband were looking for their own house and couldn't find anything they liked, so they designed their own home and the business just kind of took off from there. Classic case of 'building something people want', since they solved their own problem.",1226215882

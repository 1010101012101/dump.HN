Sure, some people would overarchitect because culture says so, but I think the more important thing is that Java doesn't give the developer ""other choices"". If you, for example, make the factorial function in Python, you wouldn't have to worry about integer overflow, because Python does that for you. Therefore, a Python equivalent would be (in theory) easier to understand. The fact that you have to wrap a class around the function is also an example of ""limitations"".",1296057525

I have bought 10 or 12 of their themes and the one reason I do it is because they never stop updating old themes. They have themes (like FreshNews) that they launched the company with years ago, and to this day it still gets regularly monthly updates to bring it in line with all the other themes.<p>This was something (as a customer) that I didn't expect and as a developer, I have a hard time figuring out how the maintenance cost isn't crushing their dev schedules (something like 30 themes total to maintain now).<p>BUT, this is exactly why I stuck with them and kept buying their themes as opposed to going to another strong alternative like Thesis. They just kept adding value.<p>From my customer-brain perspective, there was NEVER a point I felt taken advantage of, NEVER a point that I doubted my investment (short or long term) in using their product because they were clearly willing to stand right behind it in full support for the long haul.<p>You don't see this a whole lot... most folks release something (e.g. Mobile app, Web service, desktop util, open source project, etc.) and move on to the next big idea. The compulsive maintaining of all their company assets as they moved forward, regardless of what new opportunities came their way, was the only hook that mattered to me and has kept my wallet open.<p>Ignore the starry-eyed unicorn wording around WooThemes... that's not important (buy what works for you).

I wanted to return to a role where I would be closer to customers so I could see my work  benefit the end user first hand. I reasoned this meant joining a small product team as a developer or a larger team as a product manager. So I told the Google recruiter I may be interested in a product manager role, and may be a developer role if it was a smaller team.<p>I was flabbergasted when he told me ""Frankly, you have no chance of getting those roles at Google in the near future."" I have a Masters in C.S. from a top engineering school and classmates / ex-colleagues at Google in those exact roles, so I suppose this guy just wanted to hire me for the role he had been assigned, but what a shitty way of trying to do it!<p>May be this was an isolated incident.

I asked where he'd gotten the time machine.)<p>The second is that if you look at blog posts and the like from inside the Perl community, such as it now is, you get the impression that it's the kind of crowd that thinks they're smarter than everyone else because no one else gets their inside jokes.  Which comes from the top --- Larry Wall seems to think he's really clever when he justifies some of Perl's more dubious features by pointing out that natural languages do that too.

This is my first adventure in coding (my background is not CS). I started learning rails about a month ago via railstutorial.org. When I finished that, I felt the best way to continue learning would be to just build an app from scratch. I came up with this concept while observing how crazy the world had gone over WikiLeaks.

It took me about two weeks to code, doing just about everything for the first time. If you were to look at the code you could tell the sequence in which I did things by how ugly it is :).

My knowledge prior to this experiment was limited to HTML and CSS, I am now comfortable reading and writing rails code (though I find every day I have so much to learn!).<p>I do not know whether i will develop this further as it was really just a means to prepare me to work on some other (maybe commercially viable) projects.

If you are looking for a minimalist service, then it makes sense to go with Amazon SES. I work for JangoSMTP and we often have clients coming to us from other transactional email companies, because they needed more than what these companies offered. Deliverability is a major issue that comes up. You may be able to send out mass quantities of email, but without an experienced email marketing provider you may struggle to reach people's inboxes. Delivery is as much an art as it is a science, and it takes constant focus to stay on top. JangoSMTP offers the choice between sending via API or SMTP. With Amazon, you have to use the API. We also offer open and click tracking, as well as advanced reporting (Google Analytics, logging, etc.). If reporting is important to you, you will want to consider a service like JangoSMTP that is more advanced than Amazon SES.",1296054821

2143485,comment,2142664,2143384,0,0,roel_v,,,"True, it's a major pain to distribute software in object code form on Linux. The many package systems, moving target libraries, C++'s lack of a standardized ABI; they all make it hard. Originally my previous post had a long-winded ramble on the many evenings I wasted downloading the 25 or whatever many it were parts of WordPerfect, assembling them to the right places, fixing issues with libraries, ... It was most certainly not end-user ready, but the user base at that time was composed of people who could theoretically have managed the technical parts, but just weren't willing to pay (that includes myself).<p>But since you bring up Debian, they were the first with a fully functional and well-working package system that automatically downloaded packages etc., it worked (still does, probably) great. But the Debian community was ('is', maybe, I don't know the current state of affairs) so infused with the Free mantra that any for-pay software to be distributed through them would be politically unthinkable. Yes there are practical issues with distributing binaries that you can't recompile yourself and yes I know about non-free, but there is downright hostility to encouraging, fostering or even enabling a for-pay Linux software ecosystem in the Debian world (elsewhere too, it's just an example). I subscribed to some Debian mailing lists for a while 7 or 8 years ago, and on the non-technical lists most of the traffic seemed to be about if this or that package was Free enough to be worthy of inclusion in Debian! I mean it's OK, they all have the right to do what they want, who am I to tell people what not to. And one person isn't the next one and when there are 10 nerds in a room there are 11 opinions on <i>anything</i>, I know; my point is, let's stop claiming that Linux users would pay if only there was no DRM, or ease of use, or better quality, etc. etc.; let's just all face the facts and say that the culture is generally hostile to the idea of paying for software, that binary-only software is a second rate citizen, looked down upon to the point of contempt, and that no software company has enough cloud to change this.<p>All of the above is OK, if that's what people (other people) in large enough amounts want. Those who don't will go elsewhere, it's a (mostly) free world. But let's also be honest about the fundamentals. I've deluded myself for 10 years with the Free Software mantra and used the same tired arguments - we're being held down by The Man, next year will be the Year of Linux on the Desktop, there's real money to be made in support and training and customization, etc.; the reality is simply the opposite. (I guess that's why I'm railing so hard on this now, just like ex-smokers are the most obnoxious anti-smoking ""activists"" - I guess it's the self-loathing after a major disillusion of realizing you've been wrong on something you had strong beliefs about for a sizable amount of time :) )",1296054713

Android buyers today are the mainstream, many of whom are paying as much for their handset, and as much on their contract, as the iPhone equivalent. They are competitive choices, and there is no longer any clear demographic difference between buyers.<p>You don't sell 300,000+ handsets a day targeting the geek demographic. My brother and his girlfriend, who I thought were the pinnacle of the iPhone demographic, I was recently shocked to find got a HTC Desire Z and a Galaxy S, despite their other household devices being an iPad and an iPod Touch. I had no part in that decision as I keep my evangelism in the online world.<p>As an Android buyer I've only purchased three applications in my history with the devices: WeatherBug Pro, a top-rated racing game that I then returned, and NFL's Game Center.<p>Am I cheap? Quite the opposite: My steam catalog is stuffed to the gills, and all of my music is legally owned (on top of a rdio subscription).<p>I <i>want</i> to spend money on Android apps. I <i>want</i> Angry Birds to have a pay version so I don't have to worry about my kids accidentally clicking on ads during play.<p>So why don't I spend more?<p>Not only is the market app terrible (the lack of decent heuristics being the biggest deficiency), as a long-time Android booster I will openly say that the majority of Android applications suck just as strongly. It's getting better, but in general it's still quite a gamble if you're getting something decent or not, and I can't imagine the 15 minute window has improved confidence levels.<p>It isn't always the app's fault, either. The racing game I mentioned seemed decent enough, but the constant garbage collection of the platform made it a pause-filled, unpleasant experience. This, of course, is one of the things that the slow-to-come 2.3 release (remember when the purpose of buying the Nexus One was supposedly fast releases?) aims to solve.<p>I actually felt guilty returning that app because it wasn't really the fault of the app's developers, but it made it unplayable.<p>The NFL application I only bought after actually seeing it on the NFL.com webpage. I had found it in the market search previously, but didn't buy it because there is no guarantee that ""NFL Enterprises"" is actually NFL Enterprises, or if it's some guy calling himself that. The Market also needs, optionally, something like Authenticode/vendor verification. I would not in a million years trust a purported bank application independently discovered on the Android market because there are zero guarantees.<p>To link myself, I talk about the market here - <a href=""http://blog.yafla.com/Android_22_Engravings_and_the_Google_Nexus_One/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.yafla.com/Android_22_Engravings_and_the_Google_N...</a>, the core takeaway being that the Market needs the ability to link a third-party rating authority. The biggest incentive for people to go through the buying process is the comfort that what they're getting is worth it. The current user review system offers no such confidence, usually offering up nothing but petty grievances and obvious shill accounts of the author's friends.<p>I'll take the Android model over the Apple model any day of the week, but there is an even better medium that would be ideal.",1296054234

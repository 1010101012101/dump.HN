1003298,comment,1003121,1003282,0,0,jgrahamc,,,"I noticed that too, and what's weird is that's not at all how you should do it.  Since the char c[0] has zero size you can do sizeof on the struct so that you can do the malloc correctly.<p><pre><code>  struct thing {
    int n;
    char c[0];
  };

  int i_need = 16;
  struct thing * foo = malloc(sizeof(struct thing)+i_need);
  foo->n = i_need;

  for (int i = 0; i < foo->n; i++ ) {
    foo->c[i] = 'a' + i;
  }
</code></pre>
And if your compiler won't let you do char c[0] you can do char c[1] and either blow a byte, or do the calculation correctly.  Note that you have to be careful with this sort of allocation if you are on a machine that has certain alignment requirements (e.g. Sun).",1261151935

Because I've come to realize that in America, supporting things like health care reform and gay marriage get me tagged as left-wing, when in reality I suppose I'm closer to the right than I am to the left.<p>The right wing in America is batshit insane. I'm perfectly delighted to have them stay away from education. But regarding an actual conservative viewpoint, I find my professors tend to be pretty evenly mixed. I've got two or three this semester who're all for the free market and capitalism, and I've got two or three who'd prefer more government control over things. I don't think people from either side think gays shouldn't be allowed to marry, or that women shouldn't be permitted to abort, but again, I don't see that as left-wing. That's just common sense.<p>Perhaps there's <i>some</i> left wing bias, but I wouldn't go so far as to call it extreme. Furthermore, you can be a right-wing <i>student</i> in any of those fields and face no enormous barrier whatsoever, and that's what this is a discussion of. So I'd still argue that the computer science division has a more extreme cultural gap. (Further: Have you tried being a right-wing <i>computer science</i> major? I was talking to a guy at UMaryland and told him I was taking an advertising class and he accused me of ""raping and pillaging"" America. That's <i>way</i> lefter than you'd find in any other field, except maybe English, and English majors are mild-mannered.)",1261151753

For instance, standard punctuation would have me write: Please append the extension "".txt."" For clarity, I'd re-write: Please append the extension "".txt"" to the file. Much of this comes from the notion that punctuation resides insides the quote marks. But the rule comes from a practice fueled by function: the period and comma were the two most breakable tiles for printers, and having them inside another tile meant they were far less likely to break. I increasingly find myself quoting text exactly, and I place punctuation not in the original outside the quotation.<p>But I also use ""they"" as a first person singular gender-neutral pronoun: I don't know the author of that article, but they certainly did a good job.

But I wonder how exploratory they were in finding an answer since they both ended up with ""let's put e-ink in their hands with 3g and long battery life"".
---<p>First of all, the long battery life comes as a function of the e-ink screen. It's not a built-in design feature, it's an advantage of the technology that takes no charge to retain content on the screen. Secondly, who really uses the 3G on their ereader, and for what purposes?<p>3G is a way for the companies to push books to the consumers and a way for the consumers to pull books on the go. It's like a glorified USB wire that can transfer books to your device from anywhere.<p>Another thing to consider is the ""illegal"" market for books. Apple (and other music players) did luck out with the plethora of freely available music. How many of you would have your current portable music player if you had to pay for every song on it?<p>E-readers have no where near that advantage. To Amazon and B&N it might as well be about pushing books to consumers rather than pushing the device itself. Creating a network of people who have readers means being able to sell ebooks to them.<p>What will be interesting (at least for me) to see is the following:<p>What happens if publishers don't ""get it"" like the music industry didn't ""get it"". Things like delaying ebook releases to months after the print releases.<p>Will there be an increase in the consumption of public domain and other freely available books (CC, etc)? Will people care about these? How will authors get people to care about these?<p>As one of the comments here mentions, the best things these devices can do is the disappear in your hands so that they give you want you wanted to do in the first place: read. And occasionally check definitions without that being too distracting.<p>I think the challenges for ebooks lie in getting content from publisher to the consumers. The technology is not the problem here (or at least I doubt it is). Your person who thinks that the Internet is Google, or that the ""browser"" is search doesn't really care about the tech. Concentrate on the ""reader"" part of ""e-reader"", those are the problems worth solving.<p>On another note: I hope we don't ""Twitterize"" e-reading. Meaning creating an unnecessary service that comes with its own set of problems.",1261151564

Why target a market were an e-reader offer only a similar or worse experience than a book and is way more of an investment.<p>In my opinion they should have targeted the student or corporate market first, where the potential to save money and the need to work with the text is higher. Things like comments and annotations could be distributed via a ""social network"" to colleges, documents could be auto updated to reflect the latest version and so on. Might be for technology/pricing reasons though, as there's currently only one manufacturer that can deliver e-ink (afaik).<p>I also think that Google (Google books/docs, Android) is in a far better position than Apple to evolve the e-reader market.

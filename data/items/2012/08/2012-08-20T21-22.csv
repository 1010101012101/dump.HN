Not only do consumers have no use for that amount of bandwidth, typical hardware has trouble saturating a gigabit connection anyway.  Adding more unusable bandwidth isn't going to help.  Of course, for some crazy reason consumer hardware often has fiber <i>audio</i> jacks.  People are weird.<p>In core routers, the landscape is entirely different.  It's actually very easy to saturate a 40-gig connection coming out of a major interchange, and there are lots of BGP tricks to work around that.

I had trouble posting the first few times because I took the message to heart and didn't want to waste other people's time. But I quickly realized that other people didn't follow the same suggestion, which meant that I should ignore the message, and even interpret it as wrong.<p>Why is it wrong? For example, consider the second message. Suppose you haven't read all the messages in a thread because you've been on holiday for the previous few days. But a friend pointed you to a message in the thread which specifically mentions your name, asks ""could you verify this for me?"", and doesn't have any followups?<p>Why should your newsreader force you to read all of the thread in order to answer something which isn't in the rest of the thread? Yet the only option there is ""cancel"".<p>Furthermore, ""at least 10 seconds"" is completely wrong. People killthread, plonk people, and develop other ways to ignore discussions. Assuming 4 hours per day means people can handle at most 1440 messages. There are 276 comments already in this thread, but I expect most people sampled a few messages on each major branch, skimmed a bit, and perhaps did a text search to see if someone mentioned a key word.

That is simply unfounded in both theory and practice.<p>Second, cathedral vs. bazaar is not really about governance, but about architecture, and they are two separate power-structures, although most organizations, including FreeBSD, mingle them, to their own disadvantage.<p>We can argue if attempting M:N was a wise or a factually based decision, but that has nothing to do with cathedral vs. bazaar, certainly not in this particular case:  What happened was that M:N came first and that was that.<p>Only once it clearly transpired that it could not sustain its promises in practice (partly because every thread programmer assumed 1:1) did the actual decision making aparatus of FreeBSD kick into gear.<p>In Linux, (which is much more cathedral than FreeBSD) or OpenBSD (at the time even more so), that decision would probably have been executed practically instantly, but in FreeBSD which is mostly consensus driven, it took some time (and angry words etc.)<p>But overall the libkse vs. libthr saga has almost nothing to do with cathedral vs. bazaar, because architecture was not the driving force at any time during that saga.",1345499515

Our minimum spend is only $10 vs. $100 for Google; lower minimum brings in a group of people who want to get a ""quick read"" on an issue (e.g. ask 100 people an opinion on a new logo design or tagline)<p>2. Starting soon, we'll be offering advanced behavioral targeting.  For example, you could select a target audience of active young mothers, Honda car owners, or online shoppers.<p>3. We're allowing multi-question surveys (up to 4 questions).  Each respondent answers all questions in your survey, which enables cross-tabulation of responses (e.g. looking at how respondents who answered ""Yes"" to question 1 respond to question 3).  Google is currently focused on 1-2 questions at a time.<p>In the coming months, we hope to differentiate ourselves in other areas, in particular data quality.",1345499485

4409952,comment,4409157,4409157,5,0,iyulaev,,,"As a hardware designer I'm worried about this more and more. PCB technology hasn't really advanced all that much in the past ~10 years, although the line rates are going higher and higher. Back in the ~100Mhz days a 1ns edge was about 6 inches long in HR370-based circuit boards, which was long enough to barely matter. Now, at 10Gbps, your bits are half an inch long, and your high-end harmonics are on the scale of your via lengths. PCB design has gotten appreciably harder in the past few years as a result - maybe three years ago, when I laid my first 10Gbps traces, I remember thinking that this was bleeding edge stuff, and some of the techniques we used were pretty exotic for the time. Now, 10Gbps is run-of-the-mill and 28.05 is on the horizon (maybe even coming into town!). It seems like we've really taken up all of the slack in PCB tech and I wonder what will happen next. Maybe academia's optical dreams from the last millennium (silicon ICs with on-die/co-die optical xcvrs) will finally be realized. Without a revolution in the way PCBs are processed and designed I doubt we'll be able to push much past 28.05Gbps in copper.",1345499173

This is something that can, in theory, provide significant benefits over 1:1 thread scheduling, but in practice, is extremely complicated to implement and has fallen out of favor across the board: Solaris abandoned the approach in Solaris 9, and FreeBSD abandoned it in (IIRC) FreeBSD 7.<p>Concurrent to libkse, libthr was developed by David Xu, and was also included in the FreeBSD base system. It implemented 1:1 threading, is far simpler than libkse, and has replaced libkse as the default threading library.<p>I would argue that in this case, FreeBSD's cathedral model failed; M:N threading ideally would have never been attempted, and it was wasteful to attempt to implement two distinct threading libraries. However, considerable thought and expertise went into the work, and the work (and decisions around it) were not made flippantly or taken lightly.<p>It was simple a case where despite best intentions and best effort, the wrong choice was made. At the same time, in what some might call ""bazaar-like"", David Xu maintained libthr as an alternative. It remained there, ready for adoption as the default threading library, until such time as it became apparent that M:N via libkse was a dead-end.<p>This was a mistake, but no entity is perfect, and the success rate of FreeBSD's considered decision-making remains statistically high. In this case where something never worked, it was replaced with something equally well-considered and far more successful.<p>Moreover, compared to Linux's gross missteps with their threading implementations (including such gems as setuid() being thread-local as an implementation side-effect), libkse was a minor fender-bender.",1345497760

Apple might market their 300+ dpi Retina displays on the basis that people cant see the pixels any more, but in our experience working on a mobile-friendly site, thats only true for some people and under some conditions.<p>Meanwhile, the majority of web browsing is still done using devices with much lower pixel densities anyway, and on these devices extensive hinting and fine tuning can be necessary to get good results.<p>We have a very long way to go before we can just describe an icon or font design in vector terms and have it appear correctly on every device. As supporting evidence, I observe that many web fonts look terrible on a typical desktop or laptop display, with quite a few being literally illegible on Windows XP. Its trendy to blame that on Windows font rendering, and that is certainly a factor, but so is the reality that some of these fonts simply arent hinted and kerned very well at all.<p>Just serving high-dpi assets isnt a great fix, either. Aside from increasing the size of the download unnecessarily for users with relatively low-dpi screens, the scaling process often leaves awkward artifacts that wouldnt have been there in, say, an icon that was designed from scratch to target that sort of pixel density. Thats partly because of hinting, and its partly because you can completely change the design (simplifying it, for example) if the larger/higher-dpi version is too complicated to work well.<p>So for quite a while yet, were still going to have to produce and manually fine-tune assets at multiple sizes to get best results.",1345497204

My original post mentioned the truism that commenting was a crutch (which to a non-idiot doesn't mean that all commenting is bad, but that when someone is bad at writing <i>or</i> reading code they need to lean on comments in a negative fashion: No longer do they need to write clear, provable code, but instead can inject lots of comments that may or may not correlate with the reality reflected in the code (more often it does not). No longer do they need to understand what code does but instead can just hope and pray that it does something similar to the vague description at the outset).<p>Cue the chorus of hilarious quacks making their utterly stupid, Reddit-quality posts to try to sing with the chorus.<p>Give me a break.

You were developing for Android on Juno and now you're using GWT on Indigo.  The libraries aren't checked in, and also Bob built them himself because he wanted to patch the logging library.  The build system depends on ActiveState Python 2.5, it breaks in subtle ways if you use another distribution or version, but no one can tell you because they just all happen to have installed their copy when that was the latest.<p>[Remembered another one: we're using a library, but it's broken, and the workaround involves setting up absolute paths to a number of files in your user directory, and no one has a complete set of the necessary because we're all working on a different subset than you.]<p>A repo with dotfiles ain't gonna help you with any of that.  I suspect that these scenarios describe the vast majority of development environments by quantity.  It's a luxury to have your build environment be describable by a few text files whose location are known rather than bundled up in binaries, Windows Registry entries, and cargo-culted tribal knowledge. Yes, that's a horrible state of affairs, but to point the finger at ""new developers"" is to miss the point.",1345496643

As such, I grew up not liking kids very much - I thought they were obnoxious, loud, selfish little creatures.<p>Then, about 10 years ago, I met my now-wife and got pulled into her gigantic family, complete with dozens of nieces and nephews. Not really knowing how to interact with young children, I just talked to them like adults - not dumbing down what I said, making jokes and references that there was no possibility they would understand - I found it kind of amusing to talk to a child like that.<p>But, the funny thing is, they really responded to being treated that way. And, it was fascinating to see how they reacted to my comments and questions. A lot of times I would say something I thought was totally over their heads, yet they would inevitably furrow their brows, and come up with <i>some</i> kind of response - often showing an amazing level of comprehension. It was really interesting to see how a child's thought process works, and how it changes as they grow.<p>As a perverse revenge against someone who didn't like kids, they all grew fond of me. I guess they liked being treated as people instead of dumb little kids.<p>Epilogue: I actually grew to like children... or the mostly-well-behaved ones, anyway.",1345496588

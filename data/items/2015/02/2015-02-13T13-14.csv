I would argue that it is more beneficial -- from your point of view -- to read as much GPL code as possible.<p>Let&#x27;s stipulate that this hashing scenario (I don&#x27;t know much about it) is an example of a common algorithm that is the best way to solve a specific problem... it probably is.  The only way in the US to defend that premise legally is to go to court.  If the court decides against you, you have to lobby the legislature.  Is the process convoluted and costly to the point of being broken?  Probably, but this is how the the law comes to grips with changes in society, and there&#x27;s really no alternative if you want to live and work in the light of day.<p>> This solution, even if not directly copied, might end up in the code of the proprietary (and patented) product.<p>I and many others are deeply opposed to proprietary and patented software.  I (of course) understand you need resources to build software, but I think there are other ways to acquire those resources.  The vast majority of software that people use is open source, free software (Firefox, Chrome, Nginx, Apache, Java, PHP, .NET, Linux, Android, MySQL), and this has been amazingly great for society (admittedly mostly rich, western society though).  Can you imagine the cost of a browser if everyone had to license it and all the technologies contained therein?  PNG, JPEG, GIF, SVG, SSL, JSON, XML, 2D rendering, font rendering and layout, hardware accelerated rendering, JavaScript, JavaScript interpretation & JIT, DOM processing, CSS application, user interface toolkits, video codecs, audio codecs, network protocol licenses, memory management algorithms, blah blah blah.

There are massive practical differences between the NSA/government holding my emails/email data without my knowledge and Gmail&#x27;s black box that your average person takes it to be. The most important being: if Google decides to wrong me in any way pertaining to my data, I have legal recourse against them with the government acting as mediator in a civil case, and secondly, Google is pressured to act within the confines of law with what they do with my data -- they can&#x27;t discriminate against me if I&#x27;m searching for or sending emails about taboo topics. Should the government be holding email data, and should action be taken on that information (parallel construction issues aside), how do I go about finding recourse against the government?

Yes, but calling the sky green doesn&#x27;t make it so.

Since the light bulbs form a mesh network, the distance from the hub is not a problem as long as a light can connect to another. I would have never switched if we had to replace each light socket, even more because we are renting our house.

(Not linking to the code anymore since it&#x27;s out of date, but I remember thinking, that is some awesome customer service).  Other pluses: limited file storage you can access over webdav, a good history of communication with the customer including interesting blog posts, family accounts that allow you to share contacts and messages, and standards-client IMAP that means you don&#x27;t need a special app to read their mail; any IMAP client will do.

In particular, there&#x27;s no way to tell a client &quot;please stop&quot; when it is transmitting the request body.<p>So how most web applications handle request bodies that are too big is to either kill the connection (which to the client looks like a network issue) or patiently pipe the entire message to /dev/null before sending a response that indicates the message has not been processed (e.g. HTTP 413).<p>Unless I&#x27;m mistaken, this can be avoided if the client sends an honest Content-Length header, but this only works if the size is known in advance and the client is honest (you could submit an arbitrary number of bytes with a Content-Length header indicating something much smaller).<p>Because there is no clear way to distinguish a server aborting a request mid-body because of the size versus spontaneous existence failure, a client might misinterpret that and attempt to re-submit the same request later.",1423832980

In total, it&#x27;s O(N log N). The runtime is dominated by reading the input! The complexity of trial division and the brilliant AKS algorithm is the same from this viewpoint.<p>Even if you had an algorithm that did not have to convert to binary and could tell in time linear to unary represenation whether a number is prime, it would be interesting trivia but nothing worthy a Nobel prize.

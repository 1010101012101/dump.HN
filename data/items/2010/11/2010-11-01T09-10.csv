Let's say 12 which could give rise to a domain with ""dozen"" in it. Like Twitter, it won't be built because it ticks boxes or has a great business plan, but just because. Rather than Twitter's asymmetric following or Facebook's friending, all members of a clique may need to approve any new member, and it won't be done lightly. ""Is this person Sponge-worthy?"" [1]<p>It could be simplified to its core. Picture New Twitter now but even simpler, and flipped horizontally. Post/item on the left side, and then banter on the right. Maybe one of the crew posts a jacket they're thinking of buying, or the result of a game, or a new movie trailer. Chit-chat fills the right hand side until people lose interest and move on to other posts.<p>Editing to add: I run a basketball forum which is a free-for-all. Anonymous posting, etc. And I often wonder how my experience of it would change if I just locked it down to the best 12-20 contributors - might miss a few challenging viewpoints, but there'd be no spam, griefers, brainless posts, etc. Perhaps picture the aforementioned concept as a micro-forum based around a particular niche rather than necessarily a particular group of friends?<p>And again (still thinking): You pick niches of interest and are randomly lumped with 12-20 others for as long as the group lasts. As with online gaming, you can privately kick out griefers or passengers. Perhaps you can only commit to 3 groups (wine, NBA, travel) to ensure you don't spread too thin.

I can see an OS that is more restricted by default but software developers, designers and corporates simply won't accept heavy restrictions and will look elsewhere if the changes impact them.<p>Regardless though, it seems odd to me how worked up people are getting about something which is, at best, a prediction about something which might happen two or three years (at the earliest) down the line.<p>b) I love the idea that you might not allow a more locked down Mac into the house despite the implication that your family would enjoy and benefit from it.<p>Surely you judge each device on it's merits?

- Knowledge and Education is very deeply valued. Its a part of how most Indians think.

It's worth noting that all studies on the long-term effects of illegal drugs have to be done (by necessity) on people who generally, due to their lifestyle, are exposed to a myriad of products that are (potentially) harmful to their bodies, and for hardcore users, have other aspects of their lifestyle that expose them to risks (plainly put, drug users often use different kinds, drink, party and smoke a lot, and addicts are prone to being homeless and/or in prostitution, exposing them to various medical dangers).

1855827,comment,1854891,1854891,0,0,roel_v,,,"Meh, this has been going on since MDMA was put on banned substances lists across the world in the 1980's. Up until a few years ago, so-called 'smart shops' (in the Netherlands selling drug paraphernalia, 'coming down' products like vitamin pills and magic mushrooms before they were banned) would sell 2C-B which has been synthesized by Shulgin in the 1970's already, and documented along with MDMA, MDA, MDE etc. in  PIHKAL.<p>Drug legislation that I am familiar with (all of them Western European) is designed to cope with this process. There is usually a 'drug act' which prohibits all materials on a secondary list, and this list is then to be adjust by 'the minister' or similar, which in practice means that there is a ministry that can fairly easily (within a few weeks) add substances that are banned. It's cat and mouse, true, but the 'war' (between chemists and the government) had largely calmed down by the late 1990's. I guess when new forms of drugs come into vogue, that variations pop up, but these too will be driven into the margins in a few years. (typically after a while the processes for manufacturing become so difficult or dependent on expensive/hard to get precursors that it get out of reach for amateur chemists, at which the police call it 'good enough'.)<p>For those interested, the Uncle Fester books (<a href=""http://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Preisler"" rel=""nofollow"">http://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Preisler</a>) are readily available online and very interesting from a 'chemistry hacker' point of view (I don't know anything about chemistry but I still enjoyed reading them very much, for the 'underground glamour' aspect and the inventiveness. Don't take any of the legal advice in the books though, the guy may be a great chemist but on other things he has some strange ideas.).<p>As a side note, is this 'meow meow' really popular across Europe? I don't know much about it but it seems to me that it's only widely spread in the UK (then again I get all my information on 'the scene' from journal articles and government reports so I may just be lagging in information).",1288602731

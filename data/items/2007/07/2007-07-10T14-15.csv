If you do that then you really have 90% of the work already done for a basic recurring billing system.  ",1184078853

They should teach you about concepts, and perhaps offer some optional seminars or workshops interested students could use for learning a programming language of choice. <p>Frankly, a ""programming language"" degree from a university would devaluate the value of the degree in my opinion (ie if a student would get points for knowing a programming language). Might as well just go for Microsoft Certification.<p>I also don't see why they have to agree on a standard programming language for the whole CS department. Why not let each teacher do their own thing, and let the students decide (teacher insists on Pascal -> students won't attend the lecture). ",1184078747

Here's the situation: I and one of my coworkers have been working on a prototype for a startup that could easily be described as a conflict of interest. The startup is in the same industry as the company we work for. The idea involves referring business to companies like the one we work for. In one sense, we'd be driving business to the one we work for, but would also be driving business to direct competitors (hence the conflict of interest).<p>At some point, we will have to have a conversation with our boss. I'm trying to come up with a way to spin the conversation so that it could be a mutually beneficial arrangement. Ideally, it would be great if the company would seed fund us, although that is a very long shot. <p>As I stated above, in one sense it could be beneficial because our startup would be driving business to the company, but on the other hand, it would also be driving business to its competitors. <p>We aren't comfortable with flying under the radar as long as we can - so we either need to get out now or work on a prototype and when it's further along, have a sit-down with our boss. <p>Has anyone been in this situation?

My feeling is that the situation is simply different for Marc and Jason. Both of them are already rich, so they're comfortable aiming for IPOs/billion-dollar exits or bust -- just like VCs.

439477,comment,438831,439254,0,0,unalone,,,"You're fighting a straw man. I never said things weren't worthy of thought, or that there is shame in thinking about really stupid things. I said that I disliked the attention it was receiving on Hacker News. To take it to one extreme, while I'd never tell somebody that writing fanfiction was bad, I wouldn't nominate it for a Pulitzer. I wouldn't give the writer awards. I recall reading something wherein a fanfic writer was complaining that the lack of published fanfiction novels was ""censorship"" on behalf of publishers. Similarly, is it censorship for my to say I <i>don't</i> want awful, nonintellectual papers on Hacker News? No.<p>The problem with <i>your</i> statement (I won't call it awful) is that the flip side of intellectualism is that there are standards to be had. It means that while I can't deny people thought, I <i>can</i> choose to rebut the things that they say, which I attempted to do. I didn't just say ""Garfield, shit, censor."" I said, ""I dislike this, because it makes it look like analysis is merely bullshitting about really simple things.""<p>This article isn't thought-provoking. It doesn't teach anything unless you've never seen these comics before. Even now, I doubt anybody gets <i>anything</i> out of the article - all they get, they get from the comics. The article is fluff. By criticizing it, I wasn't denying high schoolers the right to critique! Far from it: I was saying that while high schoolers may not be smart or discerning in the crap they write, Hacker News is, and I dislike that so many people are voting up a crap story. There's no intelligent discussion coming up. The big talk is about whether or not Garfield Minus Garfield ripped off other things (which it did). People aren't discussion the fine art of comic craft, or <i>anything</i> interesting comics-related. This story's taking up a slot it shouldn't, and it's absolutely one of the worse Hacker News stories I've seen. It ticks me off because it's indicative of the community.<p>And for that matter, it ticks me off that you think it's right to bend and twist what I said. You make me out to be an intellectual Nazi. ""Send me a box of matches."" All the suggestions of censorship. I mean, come <i>on</i>. You've been here longer than I have, and still you see it necessary to respond so childishly?<p>It annoys me that this is what this site's becoming. And my original point was, calling <i>this</i> intellectualism is insulting the real intellectuals. It's like calling XKCD a physics teacher.",1232301341

439472,comment,439262,439465,0,0,pmjordan,,,"<i>Why are there no successful VC's that follow your and Matt's ""founders can reliably predict the future"" strategy?</i><p>Because you're assuming that I'm saying that all 3x valuation situations are the same. Obviously the founders (especially first-timers) will usually be much keener to exit at 3x than risk crashing and burning, because there's more on the line for them personally than for the VCs. And it's understandable that VCs (need to) protect against that, as it probably happens a lot.<p>However, the author (an investor himself) deemed this case sufficiently noteworthy to write about it. The impression I got wasn't that this was as clear cut a case as the usual ""hold out until 10x valuation"". But I suppose it comes down to the fact that we know very little about this specific case.",1232300926

439465,comment,439262,439449,0,0,gravitycop,,,"<i>the founders thought things were going to get worse, not better</i><p>This is speculation about the future. The market has tested its value, and the value must have been found to be poor, otherwise exit decisions would be based upon it. In other words, what the market tends to weed out is micro-management.

439457,comment,438871,439177,0,0,jjames,,,"I may have misstepped using the word pulp as it surely would be conflated with the genre.  I was using it in a more general purpose way.  I will (try) to refrain from that in the future.<p>Let me find another example which can't be confused with Shakespeare.  The Beatles wrote music to be enjoyed by the masses, popular music if you will in much the same way Vanilla Ice did.  I do assign one more value over the other simply for longevity of the it's presence in and impact on western culture.  I will let you guess which one.  There's a good reason I can assume which you will guess.<p>I hardly fault pulp (I tried) for aiming at culture.  I am simply rating its aim and potency.  What is PHP influencing?  How are PHP developers going to advance programming?  In 50 years will we be using it?  Will there be 30 newer programming langauages that picked up the choice bits from PHP?<p>It probably doesn't matter and definitely not for programmers today but in conversations evaluating the success or failure of languages these topics will be prime.",1232299128

The sounds occupy different parts of the spectrum - wind noise is pretty white, but more in the higher part of the spectrum. Engine noise is a very deep, black-ish noise. You can hear the difference between a jet in climb and approach - the former makes a much louder, deeper noise. The latter sounds just like a skydiver, incidentally - if you stay at a quiet drop zone, you'll often wonder if there's a jet somewhere high up in the sky.",1232298529

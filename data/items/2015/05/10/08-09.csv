9519364,comment,9518920,9519202,0,0,comex,,,"Although the video going viral is a bit much, in general, I&#x27;d view the humiliation as potentially giving a <i>positive</i> lesson to a 14-year-old.  Griefing (which I&#x27;d call obvious cheating a form of, though I don&#x27;t play GW2 and don&#x27;t know the exact circumstances here) is a really uniquely digital phenomenon, because you can go around pissing people off and laughing about it <i>without any real consequences</i> - at worst your account gets banned, and you can go make a new one - and with the separation of anonymity and limited chat tools making it easy to mentally dehumanize your targets.  Now, to some extent I think griefing can be funny, especially if honed to an art like in those YouTube videos; in the majority of games where the consequences of dealing with a griefer are little more than a few minutes&#x27; irritation, the people who get most annoyed sometimes need to chill out and remember they&#x27;re just playing a video game.  But it also gives the griefer a power trip in exchange for behavior that would be pretty anti-social if applied in the real world.  By making the griefer encounter a form of social judgement for their actions, rather than just a faceless &quot;you are banned&quot; screen, they&#x27;re giving them a taste of reality.<p>Also, there&#x27;s no such thing as bad press.  The player in question is now infamous for this video, which I bet they see as a silver lining at worst; more ego-boosting than the hacks themselves at best.<p>(I say this as someone who, in my early teens, was on the receiving end of a banhammer or two on sites I really cared about; I probably remember these instances relatively well because they invoked strong negative emotions in me, which I guess isn&#x27;t good, but they also made me introspect and resolve to be more mature in the future.  Never cheated in video games though.)",1431248399

9519357,comment,9518104,9518104,0,0,cgabios,,,"It sounds like it&#x27;s far too early and you would blow your chances with investors, and probably even angels.  If you could manage to take on experienced business co-founder, that might signal some validation that the venture might have legs.  But you&#x27;re not going to get very far in the jungle of business on a wing and a prayer alone, you need someone and/or advisors with experience.  If you could convince someone that has exited before, that would add to overall perception and validation.  If investment were absolutely required for a venture to survive, it often comes across as desperation and a red flag to investors that makes them wary of the founders&#x27; ability to manage money and contain costs... ignorance is no excuse when it comes to money.  That said, it is imperative for founders to track and minimize costs to demonstrate penny- and pound-wisdom to potential investors.  Demonstrating religious accounting hygiene may mean the difference between investment and non-investment (see also: Felix Dennis).<p>I hope your venture is successful and be sure to keep the team together and pivot into something else if the current thing doesn&#x27;t work out... good teams are hard to come by.

9519298,comment,9516217,9516217,0,0,Ericson2314,,,"I&#x27;ve used CLaSH over most of the pass year to do all my Verilog assignments (CS major doing EE electives), and also contributed a bit to the project, so figure I&#x27;d offer some insight.<p>For all you saying &quot;but sequential is the hard part&quot;. Yes functional programming is most clearly a smash-hit with combinatorial circuits, but CLaSH shines with sequential circuits too. Basically, time-varying nets are represented as infinite streams where the nth element is the value at the nth cycle. Registers are basically `cons`, they just &quot;delay&quot; the stream by one cycle, tacking on the initial value in front. To make complex sequential code you just &quot;tie the knot&quot; around the streams with `letrec`s -- which actually corresponds to exactly what the feedback loop looks like on the schematic. [Anyone that&#x27;s done FRP should recognize this ideom.] In this way CLaSH is both more high-level and more low level than Verilog/VHDL: clocks nets are derived automatically, but feed back loops are explicit.<p>Now if you are an electrical engineer, subsisting one tedious task (routing clocks) for another (programming without &quot;blocking assignment&quot;) might seem like no net gain. But us functional programmers are fluent at working with such fix-points, and abstracting both what we tie together an the knot-tying itself. The Moore and Mealy combinatorial are the tip of the iceberg -- examples that we hope will be more accessible to electrical engineers unfamiliar with functional programming.<p>For all you saying that &quot;the hard part isn&#x27;t working with the HDL at all, but lower level concerns like timing, layout, etc&quot;, I have two things.<p>First you are acting like HDL writing is not on the &quot;critical path&quot; of your development process, and thus of no concern. Well that&#x27;s not just true--you can&#x27;t have one engineer do HDL writing, one do layout, and one engineer do testing completely independently because there are some basic data dependencies here that linearized the development workflow. It may not be the component with the &quot;most delay&quot; but it&#x27;s still on that critical path, and thus improving it will yield at least some speedup to some extent. Automatic layout and timing analysis is great too, but unless you have a massive amount of computing power at your disposal, AFIAK you can&#x27;t get very far, so improving the HDL side of things might be the /best/ you can do.<p>Second, there is the development cost of finding all your bugs with low-level tools. Yes timing analysis is essential, but it&#x27;s not great in diagnosing the underlying problem. If you have lots of code that, well, isn&#x27;t very aesthetically pleasing, and you do all your debugging on FPGA or with timing analysis, I suppose just about all bugs look like timing issues. With CLaSH:<p>- You have far less code, and it&#x27;s more high-level, so just reading looking for errors it is more productive.\n - You can try out your code on the repl, seeing providing a stream of inputs and getting a stream of output. High level state machine errors (do you really nail this the first time with verilog?) are easily caught this way.\n - Because you have more opportunities to modularize your code, you have more opportunities to test components in isolation. Unit tests vs. System tests--y&#x27;all know the deal. The former is no panacea, but obviously it makes complete code/path coverage way more tractable computationally.\n - QuickCheck. I generate programs, run my single-cycle and pipeline processor for n cycles, see if they both halted and compare register/mem stage, otherwise throw out the test. I /suppose/ you could do this with C-augmented testbenches, but it would be way, way, way more code and effort. QuichCheck worked so well that I never wrote a test bench.\n - EVENTUALLY, with idris or [faking it with] dependent Haskell prove your circuit correct up to the synchronous model CLaSH is built around.<p>In practice I can say I honestly wrote and debugged programs all from GHCi (the Haskell REPL, so very much in software land), and saw them work first time on the FPGA. Where this didn&#x27;t happen was usually do to a black boxes, like megfunctions and other components on the dev board. Obviously my Haskell testing is of no use if I model them wrong in CLaSH.<p>Finally, it would be dishonest and misleading to not mention CLaSH&#x27;s downsides. CLaSH is designed assuming your circuit is totally synchronous (or purely combinatorial, but that&#x27;s the trivial case). I don&#x27;t know often this comes up in the real world, but in interfacing with the components on the dead board, I often had to do things that violated rigidly synchronous circuit design --- inverting my clock to get a second 180-degree-off clock domain, asynchronous communication with SRAM. [CLaSH supports multiple clock domains, but only knows about their relative frequency, not phase.] You can often still describe these circuit in CLaSH, but because it violates its synchronous model, it won&#x27;t understand them and neither will your Haskell-land testing infrastructure. Basically you loose the benefits that made CLaSH great in the first place. Fundamentally, I think true fixing these cases means designing a lower-level &quot;asynchronous CLaSH&quot; that both normal CLaSH and these cases can elaborate to. Trying to tack them on as special cases to CLaSH and it&#x27;s synchronous modle won&#x27;t fly.<p>But all is not lost, if you can contain the model-violation to one bit of code and give it kosher synchronous interface, you are all good. Write some Haskell to simulate what it does (need not be even in the subset CLaSH can understand), and make a Verilog/VHDL black box. CLaSH doesn&#x27;t help you with that module, but that module doesn&#x27;t pollute the rest of your program either. Most real-world designs are by and large synchronous, unless the world has been lying to me. So the quarantined modules would never form a significant part of your program.<p>That about wraps it up, ...hope somebody&#x27;s still reading this thread after writing all that.",1431246301

If you take 20 tenured professors doing research, who all understand some undergraduate level subject forwards, backwards, and upside down - they won&#x27;t all be equally good at presenting it.<p>So make the lectures another (paid for) source to learn from. Over time, they&#x27;ll only get better and better, with feedback. If that happened, there would still be a need for college as we know it. Students will have questions, need to do work to understand material, and need  feedback (grading) to grow. They would of course also benefit from working and learning with other students.<p>With this model, the best undergraduate college would be the one with the best TAs/&quot;professors&quot; (ones who did grading and explaining, but that was their focus.) If you value working with other students of similar intelligence and motivation levels, perhaps that&#x27;s where the selectivity/prestigiousness of the school might come in and provide that (but if you bother to respond, let&#x27;s not focus on that bit.)<p>I think that would make for a much better experience for all. Graduate school would still exist of course, and I&#x27;d imagine more research oriented professors would be happy to spend more time with their grad level students. Grad students would still be evaluated for admission to a program based on their mastery of the undergrad concepts - only under this system they&#x27;d at least ALL have the benefit of being lectured by the best qualified to do so.<p>Further, it would be far easier for prospective students to evaluate where they&#x27;d spend their four years after high school based on things like admissions rates from undergrad to top level grad schools, and/or job placement rates - as these would reflect just how good the TAs/course administrators were at aiding the students at mastering the subjects.<p>Perhaps people might respond to me along the lines of, &quot;umm, that&#x27;s pretty much what undergrad is right now&quot;, but it just wasn&#x27;t my experience. A majority (no, not all) of the professors seemed much more interested in their research, rather than teaching, i.e. burning through powerpoint slides and jetting.",1431246030

From what I understand, the long-standing rejection of this idea by gamers is a consequence of cognitive dissonance.<p><a href=""http://psp.sagepub.com/content/early/2014/01/22/0146167213520459.abstract"" rel=""nofollow"">http://psp.sagepub.com/content/early/2014/01/22/014616721352...</a>\n<a href=""http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022103113001595"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022103113...</a>",1431244865

At the same time, they are becoming more accepted by traditional merchants.  Perhaps the day will come when everyone uses bitcoin.<p>Given that, I have no doubt that the value of one bitcoin will steadily increase.<p>We are a long way from that maximum number, but my understanding is that it is getting harder and harder to mine each coin as time goes by.  That is, if you mine one coin today, it will be somewhat more difficult for me to mine another coin tomorrow.<p>If that&#x27;s really the case, then the value of bitcoin should grow quite a lot faster, as well as long before we reach the maximum number of coins.",1431244855

137118,comment,136970,137058,0,0,nostrademons,,,"My cofounder and I have been working on exactly this idea (web-based game maker, can share games on Facebook/MySpace, targetted at non-programming users) for the last 15 months.  Six months of that has been full-time work.  Other competition - folks with released products - includes <a href=""http://sploder.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://sploder.com/</a>, <a href=""http://www.gamebrix.net/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.gamebrix.net/</a> (they've got $500k in angel funding and 8 developers on it), and <a href=""http://www.mygame.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.mygame.com/</a>.  Both Sploder and GameBrix have been working on this for at least 6 months longer than us, so they've got at least 2 years of development behind their current releases.  I believe the FuzzWich guys spent some time trying to develop a game-making platform before they started their current idea, and I've heard of at least another half-dozen startups in stealth mode that're doing the same thing, though obviously I don't know the details.  So you're not the only one who's had this idea. ;-)<p>The problem is that ""a widget-based game maker"" does not let you create fun games for any reasonable definition of fun, and a system that does let you create fun games is probably too hard for ordinary non-programming users to learn.  Play around with GameBrix for a few minutes and then decide whether any of the games generated by it are stuff you'd be willing to show your friends.  And judging from the GameBrix screencasts, their builder isn't all that easy to use anyway.  Sploder's done a bit better - you can at least figure out how to use it in 5 minutes - but it gives you very limited customization.  It's more like a map editor for common strategy games than a game creator itself.<p>Anything more complicated than that requires <i>a lot</i> of both UI and technical discipline.  We've run into some really thorny technical issues when trying to develop a UI that's both flexible and simple to learn, and we <i>keep running into them</i>.  It makes me wonder whether the problem is even tractable, given the long history of attempts to solve it and the noted lack of success outside of specific domains (eg. GameMaker, Quake mods).<p>So that's what the view looks like from 15 months in.  I definitely still think there's <i>something</i> to this, otherwise I wouldn't still be working on it.  But be prepared for some really tricky technical issues - you'll want a top-notch technical cofounder, because otherwise you'll be pretty limited in what you can do.",1205524623

Design the 'comment module' for the large blogging platforms (blogger, wordpress, typepad, etc). Bloggers confirm their blog on the platform (to bypass captcha or similar) so a users comment goes directly into the blogs comment system.<p>2. Create a widget that an author can place on their site that pulls the comments from the server housing the comments. This widget would be placed directly below where ""normal"" comments go and would tie in as seamlessly as possible.<p>Could be a standalone service or it could be the next feed reader that takes a chunk out of GoogleReader (unless integration with gReader could be figured out).<p>Thoughts?",1205522872

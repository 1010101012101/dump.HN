3871333,comment,3871053,3871254,6,0,pmjordan,,,"I wish the Austrian tax forms were designed so that any intelligent person could fill them out. Most of the labels are unintelligible legalese gibberish plus a reference to  the relevant paragraph(s) in the tax code. Which of course is also legalese gibberish, just longer. Some of it you can just skip based on cursory scanning (""This seems to be about vehicles. I'm not trying to claim any vehicle-based expenses -> ignore). Some of it is not so easy. My first tax return took <i>days</i>, though at the time I wouldn't have had the money to pay an accountant, so it had to be done. Now I just fill in the same fields as the previous year, so there's not much point to hire one. They do change the forms in subtle ways to keep you on your toes but as a software developer you're pretty much off the radar of legislators in this country.<p>I even bought an introductory book on this stuff, but that too assumes you have an accountant and fluffs over the actual mechanics of filing. Grr!<p>One positive: at least you can do all of it online and the tax code is available as PDFs (thousands upon thousands of pages of course). It also checks simple invariants (e.g. it yells at you if fields A + B must be the same as fields C + D - E and they don't match) and calculates the total amount due.<p>Edit: Google Translate is trained using EU legal texts, so it does a good job on these forms. This is a translation of part of the VAT (sales tax) form you need to fill out once a quarter or once a month (depending on revenues) as a corporation or self-employed person:<p><a href=""http://imgur.com/a/V6LI1"" rel=""nofollow"">http://imgur.com/a/V6LI1</a><p>(no, it doesn't make any more sense in German, unless you're a lawyer or accountant, presumably)<p>Trivia: ""young wood"" in the second screenshot is an attempted translation of the town ""Jungholz"", an exclave joined to the rest of the country by a quadripoint[1], which gets the same sales tax rate as Germany, along with Mittelberg, which is not an exclave but only reachable by road via Germany. They apparently even used German currency before introduction of the Euro[2]. The stuff you learn when filing taxes!<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jungholz"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jungholz</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mittelberg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mittelberg</a>",1334998281

3871326,comment,3871076,3871076,5,0,ChrisNorstrom,,,"Very nice. Sleek and easy UI. I designed a to-do list a long time ago. 4 years, 3 developers, and $2,000 later the 2.0 version still hasn't launched. I learned a lot.<p>My recommendation is that deleting tasks needs to be a little easier. I hate those ""are you sure"" dialog boxes but on the other hand you don't want users accidentally deleting things. So do this: Make the user ""double click"" on the trash can icon to delete a task. That solves the problem elegantly.<p>There's 2 glitches. When I added projects then deleted the projects, their names still show up on the very left most panel. When I click their names nothing happens and I can't get rid of them. I had to refresh the page to get rid of them. When I click on mobile and then click the back button I get a red error message saying ""Error saving to server. Check Connection.""<p>In Firefox 11 for Windows 7 when you click the task boxes (which highlight blue) underneath the project's name the boxes change height slightly which is really awkward behavior. Setting overflow:hidden on the elements seems to fix it very nicely.<p>Color wise I wish it wasn't so grey. Too much grey can make a page look too cloudy and gloomy. Lighten things up a bit.<p>In the right panel, the tabs [Schedule | Charts | Help | Task]. Change ""Task"" to ""notes"". Otherwise it's confusing. And make the help tab the last one and the Notes tab (Task tab) either the 1st or the 2nd tab. The font-size used for them is also too big, use a font-size that's 95% of their current size. Also the tabs need some room to breathe, give the #tabs ul a padding:0 0 0 4px;. Also give #tabs ul li a padding:5px 8px 4px 8px;<p>Also you should show order and priority. There are 3 main panels. The left (project names) the middle (task list), and the right (schedule, charts, help, task/notes). In your css make the following changes: In #content #rightContainer get rid of the border-left, and add box-shadow:-1px 0 2px #666; and in #content #leftContainer get rid of the border-right and add box-shadow:-1px 0 2px #666 inset; It'll look much better because now it gives the app a slight 3D layered look. You could also do it in the opposite way (giving #leftContainer a box-shadow:1px 0 2px #666;) to emphasize the left panel first (which I think is more visually correct). It's just a little harder to do it this way because you'll have to create an inset box shadow for the right panel but because it uses tabs (with different divs on top) the inset box shadow doesn't show up unless you give ALL of the divs inside of it a box-shadow:1px 0 2px #666 inset; as well.<p>The button-links up at the very top (Sign up, Sign in, Feedback/help, mobile) should NOT be buttons but instead just links that are underlined. Get rid of the single ""sign up"" link and instead change ""Sign up to save your tasks"" to ""Sign Up to change your tasks, it's free."" and make the ""Sign Up"" part an underlined link. Change ""sign in"" to ""Log In"". And change ""header nav's"" padding to padding:2px 10px 0 0;<p>Make the changes and see if you like them.",1334997876

It says down the bottom to press ""enter"" to put in a new task, I added some notes, then clicked outside of the textarea field... then I pressed enter... yes, silly I know, but easy to make this mistake. Then I realised that the + inside the task creates a new task!<p>* Can't remove multiple tasks in one go - the popup makes this frustrating.<p>* the <-> is not working. Test case: add two new tasks to a project. I can't move the bottom one above the top one for some reason - it seems to move all the tasks/projects up and down...<p>* Add a new task - in the task tab, the textarea box is quite small. Click on another task, then go back to the newly created task - the textarea is the right size.<p>* If you click on add project, it is excellent that you have it says ""Enter a project"", but a suggestion is to not provide focus in the text area - the next time you click in there it clears the warning.<p>* If you add a subtask, then make increase the task size but move it outside of the window, then without releasing the mouse button drag it <i>above</i> the task, then some odd javascript loop starts occuring and my browser (Firefox 11) freezes until it asks me to stop the script.<p>* What do the checkboxes do?<p>* What does the text in the very left hand panel signify? Seems to be projects? I seem to be getting old ones appearing... duplicates sometimes.<p>* Why a seperate mobile view? You could use CSS media queries to achieve the same functionality.<p>* Is there any reason why there is a script tag after the end </html> tag?<p>* Can you split the js out of the page and into their own files?<p>Please take this as constructive feedback :-)",1334997477

3871270,comment,3868492,3869084,4,0,GeneralMaximus,,,"> <i>... and the trackpads on PCs all still suck at palm rejection and responsiveness while typing.</i><p>FWIW: this is not a hardware problem. This is an issue with trackpad drivers on PCs, which have been shit since the dawn of time.<p>I'm typing this from a MacBook Pro running Arch. It took me quite some time to configure the trackpad so that it was comfortable and half-usable. There's a driver for X called ""mtrack""[1] which handles clickpads (i.e, where the entire trackpad surface is a button) properly. It's a more configurable fork of the ""multitouch"" driver that comes with most popular Linux distros these days. It does tap-to-click, tap and drag, drag lock and multitouch just fine. mtrack's palm detection is better than most trackpad drivers, but still not perfect, which is why I ended up having to turn off tap-to-click entirely because I'd get accidental mouse input while typing even with the trackpad sensitivity turned way down.<p>Now my trackpad works great. I still can't use guestures, though, because (1) X has shitty guesture support and (2) the GNOME folks haven't yet added guestures to Shell. The situation will (hopefully) be fixed with a future release of X and GNOME. I did get some guestures working using an unholy combination of xbindkeys, xdo and a Python script, but it wasn't worth it.<p>If you're running Windows on your MacBook and using Apple's drivers, you're fine. OTOH, if you're using a non-Apple notebook running Windows and your trackpad vendor doesn't give a fuck about writing good drivers, you're totally and utterly screwed.<p>This same trackpad works flawlessly on OS X. Clearly, the folks at Apple have spent a lot of time analyzing trackpad input patterns and determined the types of input that should be ignored.<p>[1] <a href=""https://github.com/BlueDragonX/xf86-input-mtrack"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/BlueDragonX/xf86-input-mtrack</a>",1334995727

And those people are all on an easy-peasy all-you-can-eat plan; they are not buying individual shows. And HBO subscribers currently pay an average of something like $12 per month versus $8 for all of Netflix.<p>To me, that says that HBO would be idiots to fuck up their current cable relationships in hopes of building their own direct-distribution product. For now they can happily continue to sell the downloadable content to Amazon at the same time they release the DVDs.",1334995265

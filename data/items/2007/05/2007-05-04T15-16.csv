A MS/Yahoo combination is a play by MS to get immediate marketshare in search and other major online services so that it can allow it's MSN monetization engine to compete. <p>Startups shouldn't be looking to compete with the core businesses of Google and MS/Yahoo. They should (I think):<p>1. Invent a new service
2. Improve a service that sucks<p>I doubt PG funded anyone who claims they can build a better search engine. <p>There are some thing big companies can do and other things they can't (i.e. Justin.TV). ",1178293925

19416,comment,19188,19415,0,0,cwilbur,,,"Oh, and how much you'll pay is highly variable.  It depends on the job market where you are, and how saturated it is with competent web designers.  A ballpark of $5K-$10K is not ridiculous, though, depending on the amount of work.<p>And what if it fails to impress potential users?  Then your web designer wasn't very competent, because that's exactly the sort of thing he's supposed to understand about your audience.  A good web designer will bounce ideas off of focus groups and do usability testing, and then when the site goes live will conduct A/B tests. <p>Finally, the best way to make sure that the site doesn't impress potential users is to micromanage the web designer.  You need to ask him or her about the web analytics numbers, but if you insist on wordsmithing on every page and monkeying about with fonts and layout yourself, you might as well just do the site yourself.  (This is something I've seen repeatedly: the web site winds up being designed for and by senior management against the advice of the web designer, the potential users stay away in droves, and the web designer is blamed.)

19415,comment,19188,19242,0,0,cwilbur,,,"Web coding is not rocket science, but good web design is like good engineering.  Good tools will help, but knowing what to do will help a lot more, and that's what you pay the web designer for.  Saying ""with all the tools and stuff available to designers today, there is no reason a site should cost more than a few thousand"" is like saying ""with all the IDEs and stuff available to coders today, there is no reason a program should cost more than a few thousand.""  Programmers know that that's BS; web designers feel the same way.<p>Unfortunately, it's a lot like hiring a programmer in other ways -- the best designers will easily be ten times as good as the worst ones, and there's no necessary correlation between skill and rate.<p>So returning to the original question:  look at the web designer's portfolio.  Ask questions about web standards and (X)HTML compliance, usability, A/B testing, cross-platform CSS issues, readability, copywriting, audience.  A good designer will understand these things and be able to explain them to you in terms you'll understand.  Make sure you turn on your BS detector too, though, as a bad designer will try to baffle you with buzzwords.<p>And one of my favorite interview questions, when looking at a designer's portfolio, is ""Why doesn't Site X validate?""  The point is not to get the right answer, because there isn't one, but to figure out how the designer approaches these tradeoffs.  I've also never interviewed a web designer who provided a portfolio of only valid HTML and CSS.",1178293588

I looked hard at the MacBooks, but the glossy screen is a dealbreaker, and the keyboard isn't so hot either, so I'm holding out for a 12"" MBP.",1178292362

19396,comment,19355,19355,0,0,cwilbur,,,"The basic answer, unfortunately, is that when it's apparent that you need an attorney, you almost always needed to have one yesterday.  <p>Anything you expect to be legally binding, or that might wind up being dealt with in court someday -- such as incorporation, contracts, partnership agreements -- should be looked over by a lawyer.  You'll most likely save yourself time and money in the long run if you meet a lawyer and develop a relationship long before you think you need to -- because that way, when you do need a lawyer, you'll know who to turn to and your lawyer will have some idea of who you are.<p>

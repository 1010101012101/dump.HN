Both aspects can evolve significantly in a short amount of time unless control is asserted in one way or another to prevent this possibility.<p>I don't think it is a sign of success or failure that communities have evolved, but just simply that they have evolved.  I also don't think that every community wants to be boring eventually.  In fact, many communities exert intense control so that this doesn't happen (barriers to entry for new members, moderation, etc.).  It all depends on how it is set up, monitored, and controlled.  <p>Finally, I also don't think that wide adoption necessitates being boring.  Plenty of communities are heavily moderated/edited/whatever and still have a wide following.  Extreme examples are newspapers, movies, and tv shows.  Communities crop up around them, but most people have little control over what is published.  This is interestingly slowly changing though with TV shows and newspapers.  Comments on stories and online fan boards are starting to influence publishing, but it is still filtered in such a way that an attempt is made to keep it distinctly not boring.",1186166829

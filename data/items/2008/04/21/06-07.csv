However, since I grew up in the town where Digi-Key is located and once dated the daughter of a bodega owner, I must proceed.<p>First, bodega and convenience store owners don't order smokes from Philip Morris, they get all their stuff from various distributors. The stores themselves are usually locked into one distributor for junk food/smokes and another for liquor. Depending on how low you go on the convenience store food chain, often times the ""distributor"" is just a guy with a truck. Thus I'm not sure a good online business could be made aggregating the various prices of cigarette distributors.  A useful startup idea would be a location-based mobile app that would tell you which bodega nearest you carries the cheapest cigarettes. You could make it non-evil by selling ads for nicotine replacement therapy that you would have to click through before getting the price for a hardpack.<p>As far as Digi-Key goes, they aren't the biggest distributor of electronic components... maybe in the top 20, or maybe top 10. However,they probably ARE the biggest distributor that will sell small lots to hobbyists. They are also one of the major employers in a small town in a rural area that has had a flat economy for decades. The only other employer of note is the snowmobile factory. Most of the money in the area is made by landowners who are paid your tax dollars to not farm their land, or else grow sugarbeets, one of the least efficient ways of obtaining sugar. Since they would have had to pay the most, those same farmers voted against school improvement bonds every year I lived there...so I'm going to have to go with ""evil"" on stupid farm subsidies but  now I'm really digressing...<p>I'm going to have to vote ""not evil"" for Digi-Key. They know they are competing on price and are doing what they can to avoid losing business. If sales go south, they have to lay people off. Most of the employees don't have anywhere else to go find work. From my limited personal experience, there isn't a CEO caste at Digi-Key with golden parachutes who all stay rich whether or not the company does well. If they lose business, everyone gets fucked. I'm guessing they are cockblocking Octopart out of fear. This sucks for Octopart and is inconvenient for people prototyping electronics, but is it evil?<p>EDIT: what's really evil is that unknown or expired link error!",1208761070
169180,comment,168750,168750,0,0,tx,,,"I disagree. ""Web"" part is usually just the UI, exactly how the author views it himself. 10 years ago people did that in Visual Basic (yes, it existed for those who don't know and was even more popular), but ""heavy lifting in the back end"" has always been there, just as it is today, along with every imaginable data structure from CS available in some library or another.<p>This is why I don't see what's different. I had a boring VB-Forms job in 97 immediately upon graduation, just like I can have a boring Rails job today.<p>Speaking of optimization: We have plenty of hardware startups here in Austin, where cool guys code in C running under real-time OS and have 4-32MB of total RAM (without paging) with very limited libraries, I bet there are more jobs like this today that there were total programming jobs ""back in the day"", since number of devices you can code for is growing exponentially.

169173,comment,168636,168742,0,0,Prrometheus,,,"The idea that a corporation should be managed for the benefit of its shareholders, also known as ""fiduciary duty"", arose as a reaction to snake-oil salesmen of the 19th century who would sell interests in phantom companies and run off with the money. The advantage of such a principle is that it tends to be fairly clean cut and easy to judge when someone has violated it. If we allow managers to work by some other standard, such as balancing the interests of all stakeholders, it becomes very easy for them to find some weak justification for any wrongdoing or defrauding of their shareholders.",1208760670

Even the NERVA and ROVER systems seemed more viable and efficient. They too have many unsolved technical problems (how do you store the fuel while the lightbulb is not lit or what to do with engine abrasion on NERVA and ROVER) but those problems seem quite small when faced with the very idea of blasting a hundred nukes in someone else's ionosphere.<p>Still, an Orion launch must be something very cool.<p>Just my $0.02",1208759813
169160,comment,163552,163552,0,0,bmartyna,,,"It's pretty clear that VCs are more like hedge fund managers than their name would indicate.  Hedging, trend following, even arbitrage are more important to maintaining the IRR of the fund than developing innovative companies.  This is by necessity, rather than by preference, I imagine.  No Managing Partner will or should allow significant bets to be placed on the roulette wheel of technology, no matter how interesting or exciting, when the entire fund, and the livelihood and reputation of the partnership could be at stake.<p>A possible solution is to expand the availability and amount angel/seed financing available to entrepreneurs by an order of magnitude, or more.  This could be done by creating a quasi-public market (offshore, since the SEC wouldn't even consider it) that would allow individual investors to buy small pieces of early stage companies.<p>Individual small investors with a high tolerance for risk and a more certain knowledge of technology, innovation and particular industry sectors would form the basis for this new financing engine for startups. Companies would need to publish some kind of prospectus and they would also be rated by the number and quality of current investors, who would also be ranked.<p>This is not unlike the angel networks of today -- but would take the model to the next level by allowing millions of individual investors to participate in the $1,000 to $10,000 range in each venture.",1208759803

Just goes to show that if you can isolate a large subset of customers that are not being served very well even in a very crowded market (e.g. videos of presentations), you can do really well. Now show me a way of doing non presentation videos much better than youtube (yes, I did notice the mid-video user comments, good but not ground breaking!) and I'll be floored :)<p>Not to beat up justin.tv since they aren't really made for this kind of video but the contrast between the same video on justin.tv (or youtube) and on omnisio is just huge.

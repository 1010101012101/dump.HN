I think it's a tactic by the Right meant to be derogatory by implying that somehow only Obama wanted it or designed it. In reality, many people contributed to it and shaped it, and the majority of Americans polled wanted major health care reform and the majority of Congress passed it.<p>That said, the OA author made points I agree with that it seems unfair and inefficient to require businesses to perform tasks and provide services which are unrelated to their core business, and arguably should be the responsibility of individuals or the government. I hate the fact that businesses are involved in providing health care for employees, it seems horribly inefficient and out-of-place. Businesses should only pay cash to employees, ideally, since that is most efficient and the most transparent and ungameable. Employees should then get health care from the market and/or from the government.",1281383994

1589143,comment,1588688,1588688,0,0,JangoSteve,,,"EDIT: My notes below are mostly ""what if"" scenarios possible with this legislation. But I like this legislation and its intent by and large. These were just the most interesting things for me to comment on.<p><i>Fifth, we want the broadband infrastructure to be a platform for innovation. Therefore, our proposal would allow broadband providers to offer additional, differentiated online services, in addition to the Internet access and video services (such as Verizon's FIOS TV) offered today.</i><p>moultano already made one observation [1], I'll add that this point could get even stickier. Say Google partners with Verizon on their Google Health service to create a ""Health Channel"" service on Verizon, which ensures that subscribers get priority access to health information, you know, because that's important stuff, so it's in the consumer's best interest. And let's say it has enough of a differentiation from general internet access that the FCC allows it. Now, you've effectively prioritized Google Health over any other enterprising startups in the online health record space, which goes completely against the <i>intent</i> of this proposed legislation.<p>Ok, so maybe the FCC will have the foresight to disallow this type of additional ""service"". But I have trouble imagining any type of additional service that doesn't somehow encroach on this problem.<p>Furthermore, I have a little trouble with this bit as well:<p><i>The FCC would also monitor the development of these services to make sure they don’t interfere with the continued development of Internet access services.</i><p>So, if some communications company currently provides internet access, but then they find that the ""added services over IP"" space is more profitible than general internet access, it seems they have two choices. Continue pumping resources into their less profitible internet access service such that the FCC is content, or shut down general access completely and ONLY offer the differentiated services. Did I misinterpret this part?<p>And finally Part 7:<p><i>Seventh, and finally, we strongly believe that it is in the national interest for all Americans to have broadband access to the Internet. Therefore, we support reform of the Federal Universal Service Fund, so that it is focused on deploying broadband in areas where it is not now available.</i><p>Ah, there's where Google's agenda becomes apparent within this legislation (you know, in addition to the fact that they've always been publicly pro-net-neutrality). Of course, I like this part of their agenda, so more power to them.<p>[1] <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1588799"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1588799</a>",1281383806

Ultimately sold to people with oil and gas perhaps. There's only so many banking services they need for their petrodollars.<p>Involving ordinary people in manufacturing endeavors keeps them from committing crimes during the hours they are awake, and provides them with an income which supports industries such as services which are greatly dependent on volume of services provided. Services mentioned like firefighting and police and teachers depend on taxes which depend on income of the general populace, only a few of which are CEOs who live in ivory towers with gilded gates; or depend on volume such as tax preparation and retail sales. In either case you need the general population to be employed doing something. That something can be productive or not. If not productive, the economy collapses on itself as it finds itself unable to import things it needs because it has nothing of value to trade.<p>The gentleman made a comment that services jobs are being lost as well. Yes, but that is a direct consequence of the loss of manufacturing jobs which create actual goods of value using many people, who then are able to direct some of the income generated from goods creation to support these other secondary dependent industries.",1281383493

In surveys, most don't understand they are not clicking a regular link in their browser, which is exactly the way Google likes it.<p>3)  End users aren't actually charged money (they pay with attention), so there is no need to pay customer support drones to deal with disputes over 3 cent line-items, like there is if you e.g. have disputes between workers and clients on Amazon Turk.<p>4)  Prices are computed by Google automatically in real time, which means vendors don't need to try to maintain revenue maximizing price points for Chilean visitors using Firefox to an article about dog washing.<p>5)  Google's micropayment service solved the marketplace chicken-and-egg problem by Google using it on their own page first -- one of the most popular on the Internet, letting buyers sign up for Google, and then let other publishers use it on their pages and automatically tap into the buyers already signed up by Google.<p>This ridiculously successful service probably sucks all the life out of the market for sub-$1 micropayments.

1589005,comment,1587748,1587748,0,0,jmcentire,,,"This is a ridiculous article.  By ignoring the reality and focusing on only a small aspect of the economy, the author attempts to covey the idea that the current tax structure is not only bad for business, but bad for employees.<p>The author suggests that his company pays $74,000 to get $44,000 into his employee's, Sally's, pocket.  The tone used implies that the other $30,000 is purely a waste.  The key point conveniently ignored, however, is where that $30,000 goes.  He mentions the abstract ideas of state and federal taxes, unemployment insurance, disability insurance, Medicare, and Social Security.<p>If we assume the author would be happy eliminating all taxes and insurance payments, we're left with a range of possibilities; he wants Sally to have between $44,000 and $74,000.  Considering the article's purpose is to suggest he's not hiring because he doesn't believe Sally is worth $74,000 and we can eliminate the high-end (let's take of the top 10% and put Sally's max at about $66,000).<p>Starting from the $44,000 figure.  $7,322 of that would have to go toward a supplemental system for Social Security.  It's not government backed and Sally has to spend time managing her investments.  As we've all recently learned, even without making any mistakes herself, she stands to lose a lot of money if the stock market fails.  $1,712 would be spent on supplementing Medicare.  The $12,000 in benefits would have to come from somewhere, in this worst-case for Sally, we'll take it out of her pocket.  Without paying taxes, Sally must pay however much the privatized school charges her.  She must pay the privatized police force to protect her.  She must pay the privatized fire station in case there is a fire.  She'll pay tolls for every road she uses to get to and from work.  I'm sure the author enjoys the ability the company has to lay off workers, so Sally will have to put back some money in case she becomes suddenly unemployed or temporarily disabled.  That's $275 for the author today -- but Sally wouldn't have the benefit of a collective pool of funds, so she'd have to build up a buffer very quickly.  So far, we're well above $21,309 not counting the costs to which we've failed to attributed any value (police, fire, roads, schools, et cetera).  Let's assume those and associated services currently provided by the government are a very reasonable $8,691 per year (many private schools would be beyond Sally's reach).  Whereas the author would save $30,000 to put the same $44,000 in Sally's pocket, just to maintain her standard of living today, she would need to easily spend that $30,000 out of her own pocket.  Whereas the employer might then be willing to hire someone, Sally wouldn't be willing to work.  Well, actually, she wouldn't have any choice but to work or die.<p>What about the magnanimous author who'll now pay Sally $66,000?  Well, she'd bring home $66,000 and immediately spend $30,000 to pay for all the gaps that taxation left.  Which means she'll effectively receive $36,000.  That sucks for Sally and distills the author's argument down to:  he wants to place the burden squarely on the shoulders of the workers so he can save money.<p>Obviously any employer will only spend as much on an employee as they make from having hired that employee.  So, either Sally creates $74,000 in wealth or more OR she doesn't.  That's the bottom line.  Stop trying to blame taxation when the reality of the proposed system merely punishes the employee to the additional benefit (beyond the value already created by the employee for the company) of the employer.<p>Also, please note the multitude of public services I failed to mention which are supported with taxation.  Research, universities, military, postal services, social services, public health, water, sewage, oversight and regulation...  Without these, Sally's standard of living would likely be much worse than it is today.",1281380830

I certainly didn't until recently and now I'm a convert.<p>Why GI is a big deal is simple: if you eat a lot of high GI foods your spike your blood sugar levels causing all sorts of issues from mood swings to hunger.<p>For me simply paying a little more attention and eating more low GI foods has had a profound effect on my well being. I find I'm more focused and centered mentally and emotionally; I never have mood swings from 'bottoming out' - aka running out of fuel and <i>needing</i> to eat. This use to cause me a lot of stress with my gf and my ex (they have told me in the past they worried about when I would be hungry next because I'd become irrational and argumentative).<p>I think it's easy to think something like the glycemic index is just a new 'fad' diet type of thing. I know I use to think only people with diabetes had to worry about GI. But what I've found is that it is a hugely beneficial thing no matter who you are.<p>Final thought on this - if you really don't think there is anything to the whole GI thing, next time you are hungry eat 8-10 almonds (maybe mix in some raisons or cranberries - they are high GI but together the overall 'load' is low) and see how quickly your hunger vanishes and your mood levels off. This isn't for 10 minutes either; I then have enough time to really think about lunch/dinner and make a really good choice instead of eating whatever is laying around because I'm 'starving'.<p>Anyway, I lost around 35 pounds in the past 2 month using this 'trick', but I also workout 5 days and get out and hike, play hockey and generally try to be active when I'm not coding.",1281380756

Or, in the cholesterol-speak most people understand, ""carbohydrates increase cholesterol."" It's counterintuitive, but carbohydrates increase LDL substantially, far more than any fat.<p>Carbohydrates increase blood sugar.
Eggs don't increase blood sugar, nor do chicken, raw almonds, onions or green peppers. But a bowl of oatmeal will send your blood sugar skywards.<p>Carbohydrates make you fat.
Carbohydrates, whether in the form of wheat flour in your whole wheat bread, sucrose in your ice cream, fructose in your ""organic Agave nectar,"" or high-fructose corn syrup in your dill pickles. They all provoke de novo lipogenesis, or fat formation. They also stimulate insulin, the hormone of fat storage.<p>Carbohydrates cause glycation.
High blood sugar, like the kind that develops after a bowl of oatmeal, triggers glycation, or modification of proteins by glucose (blood sugar). This is how cataracts, kidney disease, and atherosclerotic plaque develop. Small LDL is 8-fold more glycation prone than large LDL, providing a carbohydrate double-whammy.""</i><p>I also recommend Good Calories, Bad Calories, by Gary Taubes, which is a well documented indictment of our common wisdom regarding nutrition (ie, things like the preposterous food pyramid).

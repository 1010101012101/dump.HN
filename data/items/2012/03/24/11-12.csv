I think this fits well with lesson 5:<p>In lesson five I teach that your self-respect should depend on an observer's measure of your worth. My kids are constantly evaluated and judged. A monthly report, impressive in its precision, is sent into students' homes to spread approval or to mark exactly -- down to a single percentage point -- how dissatisfied with their children parents should be. Although some people might be surprised how little time or reflection goes into making up these records, the cumulative weight of the objective- seeming documents establishes a profile of defect which compels a child to arrive at a certain decisions about himself and his future based on the casual judgment of strangers.<p>Self-evaluation -- the staple of every major philosophical system that ever appeared on the planet -- is never a factor in these things. The lesson of report cards, grades, and tests is that children should not trust themselves or their parents, but must rely on the evaluation of certified officials.

C# programmers aren't used to magic: they're used to compilers telling them about typos. Convention over configuration is nice, but it's essentially the concept of dynamic typing translated to frameworks. It fits badly in a statically typed language.<p>I'd have much preferred ASP.NET MVC to have less magic and, for instance, decent, controllable, IDE-supported and compiler-guarded routing.<p>Example: in an action method, parameter <i>names</i> are mapped to URL parameters. This is horrible, I should be able to change the parameter name in any method without calling code being affected. Or, when this is not the case (e.g. when C# 4's named arguments feature is used in calling code), I want a compiler error saying that calling code can't find the parameter anymore.<p>In ASP.NET MVC, I get neither of those things. I might have as well gone Ruby all the way, then.<p>In short, it's brittle.<p>Compiled languages have pros and cons, but if you're compiling anyway, <i>please</i> use all the pros to the max. APS.NET MVC doesn't, and that's a shame.<p>It's still a nice enough framework, but it screams ""missed opportunity"", much like all those Java libraries that were ported over to C# back when .NET was new.",1332589628
3749128,comment,3746222,3748606,4,0,camuel,,,"ZeroVM is not a lightweight container so all the above doesn't hold. ZeroVM doesn't use any ""syscall firewalling"" techniques. ZeroVM efficiently emulates new hardware platform just as XEN/KVM.<p>Now let me address your concerns one by one:<p>1. (Host) Kernel exploits cannot happen as no syscalls to host OS are allowed. ZeroVM app doesn't even have such a concept as host OS.<p>2. DoS attacks impossible on host OS as there are no access to host OS. The interface between ZeroVM application and ZeroVM itself is specifically designed to be impossible to DoS attack. It consists now of 4 functions. Setup and exit are callable only once during lifetime of app. Message queue read/write could be repeatedly called but the it intentionally designed to be synchronous, so throttling mechanism could be transparently implemented.<p>3. We intentionally haven't hacked NaCl validator as it the only component in the system that guaranties security. Google established 5-6 digit monetary prizes for any exploits in Chrome/NaCl and heavily invest in security. For many customers it is enough.<p>4. No one asserted that ZeroVM is mature and right now it is not! So this piece of advice is correct. If you need security now for production usage - KVM/XEN is the only way to go.<p>5. OS security... So much work was done to secure OS from outside... not from inside. I would appreciate description how it is easy to lock-down OS process in multi-tenant sense. Also when you start ""syscall firewalling"" and draconian restriction it would be very hard to program such as system. Just think for a moment. You take the whole syscall list, for every syscall you decide on restrictions (I haven't found any document on web on that). Now how you work with such API? How you enforce yourself before you issue a syscall, what to do when third-party code is causing violations? Syscall API is not built for such draconian capping....",1332589574

It does <i>not</i> matter that Pearl Harbour happened on Dec 7 1941, what matters is <i>why</i> the Japanese attacked, how it came about.

It means that not working is more important to you than doing things right.<p>Again, I'm not going to expect a contractor to work over-hours, at least not without paying. And I understand separating work from personal life. I'm the first one asking for that. It's very important that anyone who work have a great life balance. It makes better people, better work quality, better work environment.<p>What are you trying to achieve by putting this on your front-page ?

Covariant arrays (which C# presumably adopted for the sake of Java programmers) moves an easy, and obvious, compile time type check to runtime.  The type inferencing in C# is very weak relative to ML/Haskell.  The type syntax is generally more lighweight in ML/Haskell as well.  For example a function that takes a list of some type ('a) and returns the head of the list if it exists or None if it doesn't looks like:<p>val hd : 'a list -> 'a option<p>Of course, all if this works in unison with other type functionality that is far more lightweight in ML than C#.  The function above is only really so succinct because I have powerful variant types and pattern matching on them.  I think they go hand in hand because using an option-type is somewhat useless if I don't have something like pattern matching to access its state.",1332587289

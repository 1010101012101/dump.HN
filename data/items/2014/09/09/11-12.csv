Move your hand. Move. Your. Hand.&quot;<p>Productivity hacks are nice tricks to get you over a little resistance sometimes. But for really bad blockings, nothing beats just sucking it up and doing the work. I can&#x27;t always get the perfect cup of coffee. Sometimes I&#x27;m forced to work with unfamiliar tools. Occasionally, I might not even have my desk available, say nothing about it being clean and uncluttered.<p>That said, one of my favorite productivity &quot;hacks&quot; is to take a long train ride. Amtrak has free wifi and coffee in business class, the seats are large and comfortable, and lunch is pizza and beer. Airplanes don&#x27;t do it for me, I think because I&#x27;ve never been on one with free wifi, they are uncomfortable, and most of the places I&#x27;d be traveling to are only two or three hours away. I take the train any time I&#x27;m traveling on the east coast.<p>Semi-related to that, I also accompany my wife on her business trips. Since she will already have a hotel room paid for, I use the wifi while she&#x27;s working in a helicopter somewhere. I get a ton done during the day and then feel absolutely no guilt about kicking off at 5pm and doing nothing for the rest of the night but sit and drink with my wife.",1410263888

It is possible to run as root without causing a global disaster.<p>> Is there any more information available on how this is achieved?\n+1 to this remark, currently unanswered. Is the &quot;NEVER RUN AS ROOT!&quot; mantra from modern Linux practices, or has it been that way since the mid-90s? After nearly four years of using Fedoras, I&#x27;m getting better about remembering what operations require root privileges, but I&#x27;ll still grumble every time I have to enter the root password to do something as trivial as mounting a flash drive on someone else&#x27;s computer.

Generally speaking, we expect smaller companies or firms with lower levels of bureaucracy (not always the case) to move quicker, so one should apply to those last since they can usually be more agile.<p>Once in the interview process, you can try to expedite some interview processes while slowing down others. So you might ask one company to push an interview up and another to push an interview back. Once an offer is about to be presented, asking questions can help delay a bit as well - you could ask all your questions at once in an email if you want a speedy reply, and you could ask questions in a live meeting or call (that requires scheduling) if you want to buy yourself a few days.",1410263629

You seem to be very confused about how UW co-op works.<p>Firstly, since you seem to be going at this from a CS academic angle - CS students are not required to join co-op, and can get a traditional 4-year CS degree without finding a single internship, ever.<p>Only engineering disciplines are required to join co-op, and for good reason - traditional engineering (mechanical, electrical, chemical, etc) have academia and industry practically fused at the hips. An engineering education without industry experience frankly doesn&#x27;t make sense.<p>More than that though, a UW co-op student has 6 internship semesters in their degree program, out of which the student must be employed for 5 of them. This means all students get a &quot;freebie&quot; if they don&#x27;t have an internship - whether voluntarily or involuntarily.<p>There is no scenario under which a student will fail &quot;within four months of joining uni&quot; - absolute worst case scenario they spend their freebie term.<p>For CS students the absolutes worst case if you are unable to find internships repeatedly is leaving the co-op program, and losing nothing academically.<p>> <i>&quot;My UoW friend failed a year due to this stupid requirement, in most other universities it will not be an end to your stay if you fail to get a job within the first 4 months.&quot;</i><p>I suspect there&#x27;s more to your friend&#x27;s story than you know. At UW it is most certainly <i>not</i> the end of your stay if you fail to get a job for your 1A term in Stream 4/4S (i.e., within the first 4 months).",1410263339

8289642,comment,8289273,8289610,1,0,luckyisgood,,,"It depends whether every web dev / web agency should do this. If the agency grows big enough to hire an administrator (in-house or outsourced), and the agency is capable of adding value to the hosting service, then why not. Customers love to get everything at one place, but you really need to be able to resolve issues. For example, if the agency serves as a glorified email forwarding service between the hosting provider and the client, then there is really no value in this, the agency is only wasting clients&#x27; time, and the client would be better off dealing with the hosting provider directly.<p>In my experience, small agencies (up to 20 people) usually cannot afford or justify giving substantial resources to web hosting. My agency is now fairly small (five people), and web hosting is so complex and fast-growing, that we decided not to deal with it. We found a good partner a few years ago and we refer some of our clients to them. Some of our clients do pay hosting to us, but it&#x27;s more of an application hosting type of service (they rent apps from us and pay annually). We have our own dedicated server on which we only allow websites we&#x27;ve developed ourselves. This is a legacy thing: we&#x27;ve been doing that before and we&#x27;re still billing some of our past clients for app hosting, but stopped selling any new web hosting.<p>If I was starting an agency from scratch today, I would steer away from web hosting and let the specialized partner handle that for my clients. There are simply too many things that could go wrong if a small agency does not have the necessary expertise. One wrong step and you can lose a six-figure client over a $10 domain. And since there are too many things to keep up with in your core business (web development), your time is better spent learning about your core business, not about the web hosting business.",1410263050

The skills taught in such programs instead are about destroying value by trying to milk everything as much as possible, i.e. maximize profits at any cost. This results in dumb short-term thinking - do everything possible to maximize profits this quarter, who cares if the customers leave next quarter.

8289580,comment,8289576,8289576,1,0,exratione,,,"In recent years a growing network of supporters of longevity science has emerged in the Bay Area entrepreneurial and venture community. It is a highly networked environment, and visible signs such as the Health Extension meetings are really just the tiniest tip of the iceberg. It is no accident that the SENS Research Foundation and its coordination of rejuvenation biotechnology research is based in the Bay Area: venture capitalist turned philanthropist Peter Thiel was one of the early high net worth donors to SENS research, and folk in the software engineering community have always made up a sizable fraction of the donors and supporters of first the Methuselah Foundation and then the SENS Research Foundation after it was spun off as an independent organization. Medicine is engineering, and aging is an engineering problem asking for a solution: this is something that is perhaps more clearly visible to people who have written code for a living at some point in their careers.<p>Which is not to skip over the fact that there is a thriving medical biotech venture community in that part of the world as well. It just doesn&#x27;t get as much press, and the people involved have historically tended to be just as conservative and quiet about the prospects for treating aging as the rest of the life science research community. Sometimes change must come from the outside, which is exactly what happened in this case.<p>Before funding SENS research the Methuselah Foundation initially focused on the Mprize: a research prize aiming to spur the research community into doing more work and speaking more publicly about efforts to extend healthy life span and produce rejuvenation in the old. At the time the prize launched, the silence of the research community and their unwillingness to push the boundaries, educate the public, and get on with treating aging was a real issue and a cultural roadblock to progress. That this state of affairs has changed dramatically is due in no small part to the efforts of the Methuselah Foundation and the networking that took place as a direct consequence of the existence of a research prize.<p>In a different world the Mprize might still be generating press and progress even today, but it was hampered by an unfortunate happenstance of research, in that one of the first methods discovered to extend life span in mice was so effective that it has yet to be surpassed or even matched, more than ten years later. It is hard to have a contest when there are no new winners emerging on a short enough time frame to interest the public. For my money, I&#x27;d wager that producing mice that live longer than growth hormone receptor knockout mutants won&#x27;t happen without the implementation of SENS rejuvenation treatments, ways to extend life by repairing damage (and thus reversing aging) rather than slowing the progression of damage (and thus slowing aging).<p>Nonetheless, the Mprize was a successful vehicle to produce change in the aging research community: this is the interesting thing about research prizes, that they don&#x27;t have to achieve their stated competitive goals or even look like they worked as a contest in order to produce the desired outcome, a revival of effort in a specific field of research and development. Success is all about networking and attention, which in turn leads to fundraising and greater activity where before there was little. The Methuselah Foundation still runs the Mprize, but is presently focused on speeding up organ tissue engineering through the New Organ Prize: working to ensure that patient-specific organs built from stem cells exist soon rather than twenty years to thirty years from now.<p>So perhaps this leaves a space for a next generation of research prizes in longevity science, and it turns out that folk in the Bay Area venture community think that is the case - and if there is one thing that these people are good at, it is networking, the lifeblood of a research prize initiative. So take a little time to peruse the Palo Alto Longevity Prize and note the panoply of advisors and research teams signed up to compete. The actual details of the prize are of technical interest, especially since they lean in the direction of supporting repair over slowing aging, but they are far less important than what is taking place behind the scenes as a result of this initiative.",1410261769

8289549,comment,8289273,8289273,5,0,bdunn,,,"Like many others have said in this thread, it&#x27;s hard to make any meaningful dent in your profit from being a middle-man between your clients and who&#x27;s hosting their sites.<p>I&#x27;m a fan of bundling — which sounds a bit like what luckyisgood was getting at.<p>Every consultant wants diversified and/or recurring revenue. This is why just about all of us inevitably create (or try to create) products of our own. Eventually, many consultants get wind of the idea of retainers, which can have the predictability of SaaS but without needing to build and market software first.<p>The issue arises with how most consultants put together retainers. It&#x27;s usually something like &quot;I&#x27;ll sell you in advance 20 hours a month of my time for $2000.&quot;<p>Here&#x27;s the problem:<p>Any first grader can figure out that you&#x27;re effective hourly rate is $100, which is probably less than your real rate — but hey, it&#x27;s a retainer and it&#x27;ll relieve your need to always be selling, so that&#x27;s OK for most.<p>Since you&#x27;ll be making $100 an hour on this retainer, your income potential becomes constrained (you&#x27;re now on the hook for 20 hours a month @ $100/hr) and the client knows what your hourly rate is. &quot;Brennan, I need more this month. I&#x27;ll pay you $2500 for 25 hours&quot; or &quot;Can I just pay you $100 an hour when I need you?&quot;<p>And this is where the retainers of a lot of the consultants I&#x27;ve talked with go south, and the relationships sour.<p>A better approach (which is something patio11 and I talked about during an event we hosted last year) is to instead sell bundles — which could include your time, and hosting — and make these bundles really tricky to divide.<p>I could sell a client on:<p>- Hosting<p>- Backup management<p>- Framework / security updates<p>- A/B test experiments and management<p>- Up to 20 hours of upgrades and modifications<p>Now it&#x27;s not so easy to divide the invoices I&#x27;m sending my clients monthly by X.<p>And I could charge... $5000 a month for that. Or whatever would make it so that my client gets both the peace of mind they&#x27;re looking for (smart guy managing hosting, backups, security issues, etc), a product that&#x27;s becoming more valuable (running a/b tests, analyzing their funnels, etc), AND a pool of time for me to do whatever random updates they need.",1410261109

So it&#x27;s not just a signal of being &quot;top 3&quot; it&#x27;s a signal of being good.<p>[There are other reasons why VCs chose not to do follow-on, such a conflicts-of-interest, disagreements on valuation, etc. but any other VC you speak to will ask you why your seed investor isn&#x27;t following-on]<p>Founders will often take money from seed-only funds or will take money from several multi-stage funds in order to mitigate the signalling risk.",1410260924

This is the killer feature.  There are limits but its faster than other brokerage accounts to get money in and out of your brokerage accounts.<p>Depending on how much money you have in your combined BOA account + Merril Edge accounts.  They will give X number of free trades a month. The highest is 100 free trades a month.<p>If you have over 100k combined (brokerage + checking + savings), they upgrade you to preferred rewards platinum.

This forces the EU Commission to keep a low profile and stick to conservative answers on any independence question.<p>You have to realize that there _is_ a risk that some member states can block a fast track accession to EU for iScotland. For instance iScotland could have to go through a 3-5 years roadmap and audit until the standard 12 points for accession are cleared (vs a best case, unprecedented 12-months fast track to the EU).<p>As I see it, this is the biggest risk for iScotland. Even with EU Parliament on your side, member states have influence and power that could slow down the process, and expose the new country to a tough start. I hope the Yes wins, but I hope the win doesn&#x27;t get ruined with unrealistic expectations.<p>Wikipedia has a nice sum up of the complexity of this thing: <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Future_enlargement_of_the_European_Union#Scotland"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Future_enlargement_of_the_Euro...</a>",1410260419

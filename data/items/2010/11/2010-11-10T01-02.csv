1888827,comment,1887995,1888132,0,0,quaesitum,,,"Facebook is being completely two-faced about this. They're obfuscating the situation by turning this into a matter of ""Google-owns-mail,"" whereas ""Facebook-owns-contacts"". In other words, Facebook's stance is that users own contacts in Facebook, meanwhile users own email addresses in Gmail. The truth is: all this really boils down to is email addresses and nothing else. If you said, ""No duh!"" to that last sentence and you're still siding with Facebook, re-read that last sentence again and think about it. Let me explain.<p>According to Facebook: Facebook can get email addresses from Google, but Google cannot get email addresses from Facebook.<p>Huh, does this sound fair?<p>I see the gears in your are head turning, stop thinking about this as a matter of ""Gmail users own email"" vs ""Facebook users own contact lists.""<p>That Facebook argument is fallacious because it's a lot like saying, ""If Google were to deal drugs, it'd be okay for Facebook to acquire said drugs from Google. On the other hand, it would be oh-so-bad for society if Facebook were to sell drugs, when they're actually in the matchmaking business."" Whether or not it's morally reprehensible to distribute drugs, at least one's stance on the matter should be consistent. Don't insult a user's intelligence by turning this into a matter of business and occupation, which is what they're doing. This is a matter of email-contacts between parties A and B, and nothing more.<p>I don't think Google is as open as they COULD be, but they have a long history of doing a helluva lot better job than Facebook.",1289353453

There's absolutely no way to enforce that.<p>Facebook saying that they are honoring user's settings is a false sense of security, because your address is accessible to me via my email program, that's how I was able to give it to facebook.  I can still use your email address I already had for any purpose.<p>The only people their policy protects is people you friended on facebook without using email address book integration, but that's not the topic here.<p>I suppose if the false sense of security gets people to use your website, you can exploit that, but that doesn't mean you can actually enforce it.  And somehow I doubt people's email addresses being exposed via facebook is going to keep the majority of people from using facebook: everyone already gets spam, and most people don't know how to track how an email address ends up in spamming lists.  Facebook may already be selling email addresses to spammers and most people would never know.<p>It's actually in facebook's interest to <i>sell</i> email addresses rather than expose email addresses to third party apps that contact you via facebook, because third party apps that contact you via facebook reflect badly on facebook's other (maybe legit) emails that come from facebook's servers/domains.",1289353452

Even up through the first half of the 20th century, they insisted they were being held down as the explanation for their much lower income levels relative to white Protestants. Then came 1960. JFK was elected. If one of your group can get elected president, there's no more need for excuses. Since 1960, Irish Catholics have grown more and more like white Protestants. Both have almost the exact same income distribution now. Catholic church attendance has plummeted since 1960, asymptotically approaching Protestant church attendance.

There's a definite tradeoff between short-term savings with no equity but high flexibility vs. long-term savings with equity and permanence.

question, but I'll try give you a concrete example.<p>(Disclaimer for others: I'm Nick's coworker, so I know more about him and what
he can easily do.)<p>I contribute to Mercurial.  There are two parts of Mercurial that could use
some help from a frontend developer.  The first is the Mercurial website
itself: <a href=""http://hg-scm.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://hg-scm.org/</a><p>The code for the site is on BitBucket: <a href=""http://bitbucket.org/segv/hg-website"" rel=""nofollow"">http://bitbucket.org/segv/hg-website</a><p>If you want to improve it, it's as simple as forking, making your changes and
sending David a pull request. The site uses Jinja templates, so you shouldn't
have much of a problem with them (Nick works with Django every day, for those
of you that don't know him. Django templates and Jinja templates are very
similar.).<p>Mercurial also has a built-in web server whose templates need some serious
love.  The code for those is here (the gitweb, paper, monoblue, etc
directories): <a href=""http://www.selenic.com/repo/hg/file/tip/mercurial/templates"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.selenic.com/repo/hg/file/tip/mercurial/templates</a><p>Mercurial's templating language is pretty much a huge clusterfuck for web
development.  We've been talking about replacing it with something else but it
hasn't happened yet.<p>There are two big, huge, ugly problems with both of these options.  The first
is that as a frontend developer you need a designer to tell you what to
implement, unless you've got some aesthetic sense yourself.  I know Nick can
design fairly well, so that's not an insurmountable issue.<p>The other problem is that you'll inevitably encounter people with different
design tastes than your own, and your contributions might not ever be accepted
because they don't like them!  Design-by-committee is a Sarlac pit of good
intentions, angry words and ugly results, but unfortunately that's the attitude
of many programmers toward the projects they contribute to.<p>Even though these programmers may have websites that look like they crawled out
of 1998, their opinions on frontend and design work hold a lot of sway because
they contribute to the guts of the project. I don't think that's a good thing,
but I'm trying to be realistic here.<p>With backend code it's much easier to justify your patches -- who's going to
argue when you send a patch and say ""this improves performance by 20% according
to these benchmarks and passes the entire test suite""? Frontend code (and
design) is much more difficult, and the results (rejected patches) can be
disheartening.<p>My advice is to do a few things, in order:<p>* Talk to the project's community through IRC or mailing lists, and tell them
  that you'd like to redesign and reimplement the frontend-related stuff in the
  project.  If they're not at all receptive, move on to another project.<p>* Find a contributor and talk to them.  Make a friend.  They'll be useful to bounce
  ideas off of and can help you when you get stuck on something backend-related.<p>* Find a designer to work with so you can make something beautiful that is hard to
  reject.<p>* If at <i>all</i> possible, make your contribution pluggable.  For example, instead of
  modifying one of the theme's in Mercurial's core, create your own theme.  That
  way people can try it out easily before it's merged into core.<p>* Submit your patches and be prepared to argue for your design against the guy that
  thinks all websites should span the entire width of your browser window.<p>Good luck!",1289351419

It doesn't explore all of the emotional connotations of owning something durable, and overweights certain experiences from the point of view of the author, when this cannot possible apply to a population of people.<p>Finally, as Russ comments - it's wrong to sneer at the purchase of a handbag or BMW - the person might be spending their money on a combination of quality product and brand, but once you start getting into the argument of purchasing x is right, and purchasing y is wrong-  you're arguing simply from a relative point of view. As long as the transaction was not done under duress, where is the problem? My neighbour spends all his money on sailing.  I find it a waste of money, but he clearly gets enjoyment from it.  Who is right?  Is it remotely possible for me to suggest that buying a sailboat is wrong?  Wrong to who?  As compared to what?  Free choices are just that.<p>Owning a house in a falling market may seem like a foolish position, and for many, perhaps it is.  But that goes to assume that the person owning a house does it for purely financial reasons, which, again, is wrong.  Another neighbour of mine is an old lady in her 80's who owns her house and lives by herself.  By any object measure she'd be better off selling the house and both investing and spending the considerable cash that would generate.  But she enjoys her garden and the memories of a house that once contained her husband and family over the span of 40 years.  Is she wrong to hold this position?  Financially perhaps, but perhaps the currency aspect means very little to her in comparison with pleasure of her little piece of land with a house on it. She could sell her house, rent a nice retirement apartment and afford a around-the-world cruise.  A rental-is-best mindset would recommend this view.

Almost universally, they spent more time writing proposals, calling meetings, soliciting approvals, and gathering input than they did working on actual solutions. Not surprisingly, they accomplished very little and had a hard time keeping up with the demanding schedules of a startup.<p>Within a big company, it would be easy to mistake all of this bureaucratic churn and superfluous paperwork for progress and hard work. In a startup, it becomes obvious to all that it is anything but progress.",1289350954

A couple of follow-ups, if you don't mind:<p>Where did the acquisition lie on the talent-/product-acquisition spectrum?<p>Also, how did those perverse incentives seep into the former start-up's culture? Was it a result of working closely with people already at the acquiring company who bought into the system? Were the executives at the acquiring company directly to blame?

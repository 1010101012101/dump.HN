6443135,comment,6442359,6442549,64,0,shailesh,,,"Kind of agree with you <i>and</i> OP, so let me add to the discussion with the caveat that YMMV etc. Some of these points may overlap with comments by fellow HNers in these threads.<p>In any organization as a prospective customer, there are three forces at work that matter to a consultant: users, decision makers and finance folks. Ideally, the decision makers appoint a dedicated person (or team) who mediates users and finance guys to create a coherent road map for the system to be built. What tends to happen in practice is a combination of chance, human errors and conflicts in priorities.<p>To survive, we must understand ourselves as consultants, the terrain and the opposing forces (anything that prevents money getting deposited in the bank).<p>Consulting is a business => the individual consultant must shoulder quite a lot on himself:<p>* Advertising himself<p>* Finding work<p>* Meeting prospective customers<p>* Writing proposals<p>* Closing the deal<p>* Writing a contract<p>* Defining the scope of work<p>* Nailing what is to be done and what is to be avoided<p>* Constructing components of software<p>* (In worst cases) baby-sitting customer&#x27;s devs / ops<p>* Testing his modules<p>* Getting money in his account<p>So, when we talk with customers, there is inherent pressure in closing the deal versus precisely defining everything. Icing on the cake: back of the mind, you might worry about milkman&#x27;s bills and the birthday gifts to be brought for your kid&#x27;s friends. Always have a good runway: six months seems optimum. Technically, even three months should suffice, but it is insufficient for the edge case when these three things hold true simultaneously:<p>* You&#x27;ve to walk away from a customer in the middle of a project, <i>and</i><p>* Dry sales pipeline, <i>and</i><p>* Unexpected crisis at the personal front: very close friend in need of money for surgery etc.<p>God be with you.<p>Now, back to the main track. The key is to first understand the priorities of stakeholders. The contradictions are easier to grasp once we put ourselves in the individual&#x27;s shoes:<p>* [Convenience] The users want everything including the kitchen sink,<p>* [Accountability for the risk] They want it yesterday but won&#x27;t commit to it on paper since you&#x27;re in early sales stage,<p>* [Cost] The finance folks want stability and the most economical price,<p>* [Availability] The decision maker prefers to spend the least of her time to be spent on this activity, except when it&#x27;s her pet project.<p>These roles may be played by different people or the same person.<p>Again, we don&#x27;t have to agree, but acknowledge that things are meant to be imperfect. Most people are actually decent and rational. Now, somehow, the consultant must figure out a good path. To begin, he should have a good handle on:<p>* The industry in which the customer operates, e.g. BFSI, Energy, online marketplaces, food, fashion etc.<p>* The nature of the market: oligopoly, crowded, emerging et al.<p>* The level of Govt. regulation: HIPAA? PCI?<p>* The customer&#x27;s position: among top tier, mid-size, small firms.<p>* Customer&#x27;s customers: helps to track the wind.<p>* Standard pain areas in the market.<p>* How customer&#x27;s competition and partners survive the pain, specifically the differences among the customer&#x27;s approach and the competitor&#x27;s ones.<p>* The financial health of the customer: if possible, try to talk with their existing suppliers in other arenas (e.g. the guy who supplies printer cartridges, the cleaning lady etc.).<p>Based on that, assuming  we&#x27;ve landed a hot lead, say that we want to convert it to money. There will be a lot of conversations over the phone, e-mail, chats, face to face;  what is to be left out of those conversations is really context sensitive. The important parts are:<p>* What problem we&#x27;re going to solve for all stakeholders?<p>* How we&#x27;re going to solve it?<p>* Communicating our approach and progress on a timely basis.<p>* Improving Vulcan skills: like money, expression of anger is a great servant but a terrible master.<p>I leave out the details on the development process, since it depends on the individual.<p>Here are a few things which worked for me marvellously in certain contexts and doomed in others:<p>* Setting expectations by explaining the cone of uncertainty in the estimation process. Always be prepared for some customers, who deliberately mislead you that they don&#x27;t understand the mumbo-jumbo, projecting ignorance as a shield so that they can ruin you on payments. Mostly you should refuse such customers, unless you&#x27;re in an extreme crisis on multiple fronts.<p>* Writing use cases for the modules / systems I was supposed to work. Most customers say that they don&#x27;t want any time spent on &quot;documentation,&quot; to which I reply that writing a document is not &quot;typing&quot; but &quot;nailing the thoughts to deliver higher quality work.&quot;<p>* Creating mock ups using sketching tools (even Excel/LibreOffice can be good enough, if one is pressed too much for time) in the absence of UX designers on the team.<p>* Writing test cases before writing my code. Helps to ease the integration.<p>* Optimizing lazily: progressively refining the artefact (document / mock up / test / code).<p>* Knowing the expected value of each task: \n    (amount of money * satisfaction * improvement in reputation) / (e-mail tennis * stakeholder&#x27;s understanding of requirements * payment latency * time spent)<p>Finally, reducing it to just one sentence: be nice, believe in yourself and humanity, be multi-dimensional and please heed Guy Kawasaki&#x27;s advice about reading voraciously and omnivorously.<p>Edit: formatting.",1380093629

That means that if I&#x27;m tracking clicks, I very well may be losing a good deal of data.<p>The alternative is to hijack the click event, wait for say 100ms, and then load the new page via JavaScript, but that also break the <i>open in a new tab</i> functionality.<p>In other words, there are no good options to track external click events via Google Analytics and still give users complete control over where the links go.<p>The best option I could come up with is to always open external links in a new tab, because that way the click handling code always has time to run.

There&#x27;s only one problem: your $1,000 investment in Next Big Thing Inc. is <i>not</i> going to be worth $1 million. The data is very clear: most individual angel investments lose money, and overall, the type of returns angel investors see on their overall portfolios all but rules out the idea that there are 1000 baggers out there.[1]<p>In short, it sounds like you&#x27;re looking to hit a Major League home run with a tee ball bat. If you&#x27;re searching for massive returns, you need to look at markets in which you can make much more highly leveraged bets. Many of these, like CDS, are inaccessible unless you have tens of millions of dollars to play with, and that&#x27;s at an absolute minimum.<p>By the way, regarding public markets: if you had invested in the right equities over the past five years, you could have produced better returns than most angel investors without taking on anywhere near the risk. Obviously, picking the right equities to invest in is easier in hindsight, but so is picking the right early-stage startups to invest in.<p>[1] <a href=""http://techcrunch.com/2012/10/13/angel-investors-make-2-5x-returns-overall/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://techcrunch.com/2012/10/13/angel-investors-make-2-5x-r...</a>",1380093177

It is applied maths and science.  If you build a bridge, you can use physics and maths to pretty much prove that it will handle a particular weight/load and so forth.  Software development is rarely like that, and even if you are writing software for an engineer and therefore you could argue that you can prove the calculations the system is generating, it is really the problem domain that is engineering but the way the software is put together is not so easy to prove.<p>Secondly, I think the term actually does us a disservice.  Software development requires intuition, craftsmanship, pragmatism, determination, adaptability, artistry.  It also often requires understanding human nature, empathy for users, being able to learn and understand endless problem domains, an eye for the aesthetic.  All of these things aren&#x27;t generally required for traditional engineering disciplines.",1380092523

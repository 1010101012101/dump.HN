They were logic errors; the attacker used Google features in ways they were not expected to.<p>The first was a GET request, not POST. Images have fairly lax cross domain restrictions. So while the attacking website can't see the image loaded from Google they <i>can</i> detect when the image doesn't load. Google was returning a non-200 response code for images the user can't see.<p>The second wasn't a traditional XSRF.

In every case I looked at (around 10 or 15 I think) I saw comments that were either sincere but not adding too much value (mediocre, let's say) or sometimes just not in agreement with popular opinion.<p>The really screwed up thing is that I've looked through the comment and submission histories of obvious spammers and I saw a guy with about 132 spam submissions with an account about as old as mine (almost 200 days) and his account wasn't banned. It seems that you can disagree around here but only to a point.<p>I get that maybe some are afraid of diluting the community but by being so overly sensitive you can really be doing everyone a disservice. Lately I feel like I have to watch out for the karma police. The guys who downvote anything that disagrees <i>too much</i> even if it's totally rational and put in as nice of terms as possible.

Do you agree that this definition should be somewhat symmetric?<p>Note that the payroll tax extension package that passed the House did get some Dem votes.

3355159,comment,3353593,3354900,21,0,jcr,,,"Paul, please don't get me wrong, but I would like to politely point out\nthe exception; job posts from YC companies <i>do</i> get preferential\ntreatment in rankings on the front page. It's a known fact, and since\nabsolutely everything here is paid for by you and/or YC, no one has any\nright or room to complain about YC funded companies getting some\nadditional exposure on their jobs posting. It's fair to consider the YC\ncompany job postings as a small advertisement supporting the site.<p>Considering the crap that Patrick (patio11) and Google received about\nmixing advertisements with results in (intentionaly?) confusing ways, it\nmight be better to put the YC company job ads in a different location\n(top of the page, un-numbered and time limited to 24 hours or so) just\nto make the intent and separation more clear. --It's just a thought.<p>Your handling of the AirBnB fiasco was stellar. You let the negative\nstory posts stay on the HN, and you allowed them to be up-voted to\ninfinity and beyond. The thing most people don't realize is ""Why the\nstories eventually started to decline in rankings, and why they declined\nso quickly?"" --The reason is people like me; those who got tired of\nseeing the font page loaded with derogatory speculation and opinion\nabout AirBnB, and decided to 'flag' all of the submissions. Though I\nhave no proof, I'm certain I'm not the only one to be annoyed to the\npoint of flagging all the nonsense.<p>The most recent HN Troll happened this morning, namely the HTTP LoLCats\ncrap. It made it to the #2 spot on the front page (possibly #1 for a short\nperiod). I was impressed that in the 17 comments, there were no ""This\ndoesn't belong on HN"" posts, so a lot of people were smart enough to\njust silently hit the 'flag' link. I just finished checking, and the\nHTTP LoLCats submission was nowhere to be seen in the first 360 results.\nHad the HTTP LolCats submission still been on the front page after I got\na few hours of sleep, I may have logged out of HN and never returned.<p>It's fantastic to know you have voting-ring detection functioning to\nsome degree. It's a great way to prevent spam in all of it's various\nforms. Without knowing the code you're really running (secret sauce and\nall that), I can see one potential problem; Since the HN moderators are\nfrom the ranks of the YC funded company founders, their participation on\nHN is most likely weighted differently. In other words, the friends\namongst the YC founders not only constitute a voting-ring of sorts, but\ntheir actions/votes on HN may have more weight. With human beings\nwanting their friends to succeed, there is really no way around this\nissue, technical or otherwise.<p>Though I have no special weight or privileges here on HN, I openly admit\nto voting up and rooting for some of the YC funded companies that are\ndoing great things. A more direct way to say it is, I'm also part of the\n""problem"" of YC funded companies getting preferential treatment. Maybe\nI'm a terrible person for wanting them to succeed, but then again, maybe\nI'm only human, like rooting for good people doing great things, and\nmaybe there are plenty of other normal humans like me around here.<p>A lot of people, including Zed, only notice the very real\ninconsistencies, but they don't understand the fundamental and technical\ncauses of the inconsistencies. You did address Zed's point, but you are\nessentially defending a non-issue.<p>EDIT: Seeing this post get down-voted is disheartening. It tells me that\nthere is something definitely wrong, and the cause could be me, or HN, or both, but I don't know for certain.",1323927692

One can even use it as an interactive 3D front-end for a substantial Python script. That is, let the script create and manipulate the objects, and just use Blender to view what is happening. In Blender 2.4 it was possible to keep a script continuously animating the scene, something I found tough to make happen after the 2.5 overhaul.<p>Blender 2.4 also let scripts create UI components, such as entire control panels to influence the running script.

You'll be surprised (or not) to know quite how disjointed and hacked together their internal systems are. Every music company merger results in years of hacks in getting data from one set of archaic systems into another. Of course, the same software could also be used for managing other media, such as film, tv etc - there are small companies that have done very well supplying custom software to entertainment companies \ne.g <a href=""http://www.ecteon.com/products-overview"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ecteon.com/products-overview</a>",1323926647

Then at some point the additional sizzle of proposed offensive tactics against Wikileaks got added. (In the most infamous presentation, the word 'Themis' is not mentioned.)<p>So to say ""[t]he Wikileaks-offensive project was known as Team Themis"" is begging the question.<p>My concern is whether Palantir as a corporation ever meant to endorse or participate in the specific 'dirty tricks' sizzle.

If you do something that you enjoy and are passionate about, it becomes hard to pull away from it; hence, you'll get further on it.  Set up small goals and milestones while for you to accomplish during the project.  I try to break things down in a hierarchy, where I am looking at goal in a monthly, weekly, and daily perspective.  These are not hard deadlines, but they give me metrics of success, and its ok to adjust these as the project matures.<p>* You will have to deal with the ADD, or you will not get anywhere, speaking from personal experience.  In my case, I hit walls and managed to work around them.  But sometimes new and easier things came along, and then I would pursue those interests.  Unfortunately, when I did this, the work I did got tossed, and I started back at square one on the new stuff.  Don't be me.<p>* In general, I begin an idea that may not be great or novel, but I try to build on it, iteratively, add new concepts or features to it.  This process heavily depends on the project though.  Generally, as I work along these lines, I am bumping into random problems that need to be solved or need a better solution. (this advice point may not be strong).<p>* Don't be afraid to fail.  Failing is half the battle.<p>Hope these four points help.",1323926083

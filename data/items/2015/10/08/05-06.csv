Consumers won&#x27;t want to stomach the price tag and professionals are already accustomed to their DSLR&#x27;s, and in most cases have significant investment in specific brand and/or lens type with a lot of expensive glass.<p>Professionals don&#x27;t care about the bulkiness of their cameras, they care about the performance and flexibility. DSLRs have 20+ years of development in terms of speed, durability, flexibility and the raw image processing power that the giants have spent decades perfecting (lots of work on DSPs).<p>How many pictures can it take in burst mode? How long does the battery last? Can I use my suite of existing lenses with this?<p>Sorry to say this camera, while unique and technical marvel, has an uphill battle from the business perspective. It&#x27;s interesting from a niche perspective but I don&#x27;t see it becoming a huge success financially for them, which is unfortunate because many talented people probably worked on this.",1444283934

The North Korea comparison is extremely useful, seeing as Cuba and North Korea are among the third world nations with the least widespread public Internet connectivity over the last 20 years. They&#x27;re also both ruled by Communist dictatorships and have been for many decades. They both have extraordinarily low median incomes, among the lowest on earth in fact. Cuba is better off than North Korea, that&#x27;s well understood.<p>Cuba should be equated to North Korea, for decades they&#x27;ve been in the same tier of economic development and the same tier of Internet access.

They can map random physical pages into one nice, contiguous virtual space, and the only thing that matters is fragmentation in the virtual space. Since a each process gets its own entire 4GB virtual address space on a 32bit system, fragmentation nearly becomes a non-issue.<p>This is also why I suspect that they were mapping their virtual address space using block translation instead of a page table - if they had a page table, even in one process, it shouldn&#x27;t have been a big issue since the virtual address space is many times larger than the available physical ram on the 360/PS3/Wii. The other possibility is that much of their RAM needs to be accessible by the GPU, for which fragmentation <i>is</i> an issue.",1444283310

Maybe I just don&#x27;t understand game development very well, but I don&#x27;t get why some of the problems they had in the post-MMU era even existed.<p>1) Memory Fragmentation - why? This seems like it would only be a problem if they ran their entire game in the same virtual address space.<p>2) Subsystem A corrupting Subsystem B&#x27;s RAM - once again, wouldn&#x27;t one run the sim code in one address space, the rendering in another, etc. and have strategically shared pages for them to transfer data back and forth?<p>It really seems to me like the idea is &#x27;yeah, we had virtual memory, and it was great, but we didn&#x27;t really use it&#x27;... Granted, they put guard pages on some allocations, but that&#x27;s akin to using supercomputer to solve your family budget. Lots of power available, but using it in a trivial way.<p>I acknowledge that there&#x27;s some cost to a context switch, and that the 2005 generation used PowerPC with its fairly cache-inefficient hashed pagetable (poor locality), but the benefits of having a hard wall in memory between major system functions is immeasurable (I&#x27;m guessing that on PPC, they just set up a few Block Address Translation registers and called it &#x27;good enough&#x27;).<p>Then again, I come from a safety critical background .. we make aerospace code, so it&#x27;s developed using the methods described in the article about &#x27;the right stuff&#x27; that was up a day or two ago.  We&#x27;re really fond of having really hard walls between every resource we can (memory, CPU time, I/O bandwidth, FS bandwidth ... you name it) for major system functions. I realize that in game programming most of those walls aren&#x27;t practical (due to performance impact) or necessary, but the memory one is fairly cheap and incredibly helpful.<p>PS - if you&#x27;re wondering, we prevent memory leak problems by just disabling dynamic allocation post-boot, which happens on the ground. Our stack utilization is also required to be statically analyzable, which means that you can&#x27;t do things like recursion. These limitations make the design of some algorithms extremely painful, but what other software have you ever heard of that can truthfully claim 0 memory leaks, guaranteed. We also do 100% code coverage (at the machine language level), 100% decision coverage, static and dynamic worst-case timing analysis, etc. etc. etc. Look up &#x27;DO-178B&#x27; or &#x27;DO-178C&#x27; if you&#x27;re curious about what&#x27;s done and why safety critical stuff is insanely expensive. More recently we&#x27;re throwing in fuzzing for good measure, but fuzzing doesn&#x27;t turn up a whole lot in extremely thoroughly tested code that&#x27;s been reviewed line-by-line by dozens of engineers (and is subject to strict design limitations).",1444281776

Everything else is replaceable.<p>I just bought a cheap Seagate Backup Plus 4TB last year. I think it was $130. Then I just let Time Machine do it&#x27;s thing. So that&#x27;s 2 copies of the important stuff.<p>Then $50 annually for Backblaze. I&#x27;ve got no real use for Dropbox and it costs twice as much for less storage. I could totally see using it in a media company. That&#x27;s just not a problem I have. I pretty much never need to share a personal file that&#x27;s too big for iMessage (photos/videos) or Email (spreadsheets). Anyways, that&#x27;s a third copy.<p>Then I&#x27;ve got iCloud to share photos/music/videos on our Family Sharing. That&#x27;s a fourth copy.<p>So everything is pretty much always in sync. Wether it&#x27;s my wife&#x27;s iPad, my laptop, either of our phones, etc.<p>Into the second year it&#x27;s cheaper than just having Dropbox alone. But the best part: It takes... I dunno. 10 minutes of one time setup effort. You don&#x27;t have to know anything but how to click &quot;Next&quot; or &quot;OK&quot; in a wizard, and it&#x27;s zero maintenance. Nothing to baby-sit.<p>And it&#x27;s a little slow, but if I really need an individual file off Backblaze, I can get it. Just takes a couple minutes to use their web based backup browser and selectively download something. I&#x27;ve had to do that a total of one time though.<p>Beyond that setting up a new machine for me for development is just pulling my .bashit theme, installing homebrew, installing IntelliJ, running brew install sbt git and I&#x27;m pretty much good to go.

Does this come down to not being able to get around pauses in garbage collection?<p>That is one reason. But if you watch OP&#x27;s video, you&#x27;ll see a lot of other reasons. In particular, games frequently have their own allocators & memory management. This is one reason why it might be hard, inconvenient, or impossible to use Java or C#.<p>That said, a lot of gameplay logic these days is actually written in a scripting language like Lua, and C++ is used for lower level systems like rendering & physics.<p>> In 2015, starting from scratch, where is C++ needed?<p>The main question is: &quot;starting what&quot;? For most web dev, you&#x27;d be crazy to start with C++. For the internals of a game engine, like unreal or unity or a competitor, C++ is probably the only sane choice. Also anything embedded. I guess Arduino & others are getting interpreters now, but C/C++ (notably minus the crazy kind of stuff in the video) is the easiest way to start.<p>I used to do hobby projects in C++, mainly graphics & image processing. My reasons were I knew it, it compiled to very fast code compared to anything else, and it was often the easiest way to interface with whatever open source libraries I needed.<p>These days most libraries are available in your favorite scripting language, and the performance can be good if you pay attention. I don&#x27;t personally have a reason to use C++ anymore, even for hobby projects that need high performance.",1444280635

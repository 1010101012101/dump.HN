10030703,comment,10015100,10015100,0,0,tripzilch,,,"> That means &quot;the rules are a little different,&quot; said Stan Black, chief security officer for Citrix in Fort Lauderdale, Fla. For example, he&#x27;s bringing his schedule printed out on a piece of paper so he doesn&#x27;t have to turn on his cell phone to check it.<p>> &quot;And they&#x27;re all staying in the same hotel,&quot; said Steve McGregory, director of threat and application intelligence for Ixia, a security firm in Calabasas, Calif..<p>> Jon Miller, vice president of the security firm Cylance in Irvine, Calif., doesn&#x27;t see the hacking at Black Hat as malicious so much as simply intellectually curious. But he still turns off Wi-Fi and Bluetooth on his phone and only logs on to the Internet from his hotel room using a virtual private network.<p>Ok I get it, it&#x27;s a hacker&#x27;s con, with hackers hacking hackers. If you don&#x27;t want your phone hacked, don&#x27;t bring it to Blackhat. &quot;It&#x27;s to be expected&quot;, right?<p>But isn&#x27;t also a little bit insane?<p>What about the people working there? Hotel staff, catering, nearby bars, shops, etc. Do they get debriefed about security countermeasures like this? Or are they left to their own devices? (or should I say &quot;0wned devices&quot;)<p>Do the hotels use computers? Do they get help protecting their systems from damage? How do they manage to get their systems back into a safe and stable state for the rest of the year for when, you know, the place isn&#x27;t swarming with people for whom &quot;the rules are a little different&quot;.<p>Sounds to me the waiting staff will be the ones with the least protected phones, attracting the &quot;intellectually curious&quot;. I&#x27;m just thinking of these additional scripts available, not the exploits, but the ones designed to slurp data after a way in has been found. They are targeted at the common types of accounts/usage, facebook and gmail, automated email digging, further escalation to ID theft, etc. Most security researchers/consultants know of these tools but they never <i>really</i> get to use them in their day job, because usually you don&#x27;t have to follow an exploit all the way through to begin protecting your client from it. But now, <i>they&#x27;re on Blackhat!</i> And the rules are a little different! Finally!<p>And even after all the hackers leave, the exploit&#x27;s still in your phone.<p>Perhaps I&#x27;m being a bit hyperbolic here, but grant that it is a pretty crazy situation and I&#x27;m actually curious, how do the local people working there deal with this?<p>Imagine going to a gun convention and being advised to better prepare by wearing a bulletproof vest, because &quot;the rules are a little different&quot; there :)",1439139541

I feel like this theme of &quot;be good to yourself; you deserve it&quot;, &quot;sorry not sorry&quot;, and &quot;you don&#x27;t need anyone else to make you happy&quot; falls only on the ears of those who are already far too absorbed in themselves.<p>It&#x27;s peculiar because (at least in my experience), I&#x27;ve found that the people who actually <i>need</i> to read articles like this are those who already give too much of themselves to other people, yet secretly wonder if they are too selfish.  Whereas those who <i>are</i> too selfish read these articles and think, &quot;Hey that&#x27;s me!  I need to quit letting other people walk all over me.

You can have as many semantic building blocks as you like. My current tool belt contains, among the others, a generic high performance imperative backend, generic functional backend, generic typing engine (which easily include various Hindley-Milner implementations as well as simple type propagation forms), generic lazy functional, generic Prolog and Datalog - these are the low level semantic building blocks which can be mixed together in any proportion.<p>On top of them there is a large hierarchy of high level building blocks, which include, for example, generic optimisation components (e.g., IR-agnostic SSA-based optimisations), generic parsing frontends, data representation and transformation languages, and many more.<p>> But it&#x27;s entirely unclear to me why semantic models should easily combine without creating unintended behavior.<p>Why would they?

Then you are the one deciding what&#x27;s good for the others, not the recipients.<p>I think it&#x27;s very tempting, and that&#x27;s why people should take extra precautions not to do it.<p>> Politicians simply think voters would vote them out of office if they increased foreign aid at the expense of making substantial cuts<p>(Assuming you avoid those $5K in taxes.) This is pretty much an age old question whether it is morally acceptable to steal a loaf of bread to feed a starving person.<p>What I am saying is that it is morally acceptable, but only as a kludge. What you really should strive for is a society which doesn&#x27;t face these moral dilemmas. Likewise, I consider charity only a kludge. It can do good, but can be done far better.<p>> If a person legitimately wanted to become better than they are, how should they go about it if not through generosity of spirit and action?<p>Assuming &quot;honestly wanted to become better&quot;, I think do three things:<p>1. If you want to be generous, do it through your own work (that you do for living). That means do not cheat your customers, or even maybe decrease your price. And it implies not trying to gain power or cheat other people in order to do good - that&#x27;s often a delusion.<p>2. If you think your work doesn&#x27;t have an impact it should, change your job.<p>3. Alternatively, to help other people, help them get the more equal political and economic power in having their own say about what their needs are (so they can better share resources). (This also carries a lot of risk and is more helpful than trying to figure out how to cheat on taxes. What I am really saying: Subterfuge is allowed if other people benefit, not you - so it&#x27;s OK to break the laws and norms regarding point 3, not 1.)<p>All of them are very hard to do, because it&#x27;s very hard to be honest with yourself and not to think you can do better if you actually become a middleman.

I certainly enjoyed the experience, and working with the families that would ultimately end up occupying the homes we were building was a unique and memorable experience.<p>I understand the economic principle of comparative advantage, and I felt like this was economically an inefficient way to provide housing to low income Hungarians. I&#x27;m not an experienced carpenter, and I could have easily paid for three real carpenter&#x27;s to work in Hungary in my place by simply donating the income I would have generated by working at home at my ordinary job rather than traveling to Hungary myself. In a technical sense, I was hurting rather than helping the overall world economy by not doing what I was best at. Knowing all this ahead of time, I was skeptical of this voluntourism trip that a friend of mine had talked me into.<p>Working in Hungary for ten days, with the group of around twenty other people from the USA, gave me time to reflect on my decision to take on the volunteer work. I still believe that it isn&#x27;t an economically efficient way to build the houses--we were amateur builders. However, \nwhat my simple economic thinking about the trip didn&#x27;t account for was the more emotional impacts that the volunteering had on the participants and beneficiaries. (One of the requirements on the recipients of the homes is that they work on the home being built for them too until it is finished.)<p>The volunteers in the group all seemed to have a very positive experience doing the work. It was satisfying to see the progress we made, it was satisfying to work with a team of interesting people of many different backgrounds, it was fun to take meals together and socialize in the evenings together, and it was heart warming to meet the clearly grateful families that would end up in the houses. These, to some extent narcissistic, rewards seem to be a key factor in the success of Habitat for Humanity: <i>people like doing it and keep going back</i>.<p>I&#x27;ve been dragged to many charity events, dinners, galas, auctions, runs, walks and so forth. I don&#x27;t really enjoy them, but the experience of working in Hungary despite the commitment of time and expense was something I&#x27;m glad I did.<p>Furthermore, there were other important effects. I discovered that at first, when Habitat had first arrived at the town, the people there wondered why the workers from the US couldn&#x27;t find jobs in their own country; they didn&#x27;t understand that people would volunteer rather than be paid to build homes. Volunteering to help others apparently wasn&#x27;t common in this previously communist country. Seeing volunteers working on these homes in these communities led some of the locals to pitch in too.<p>Finally, another benefit was the prolonged exposure to the people in the community. We took swims at lunch time in the very nice community swimming pool which seemed to be the town&#x27;s main source of day time recreation, and we hung out with the locals in the evening in a local pub that we could walk to. Everywhere we went people were friendly and would make an effort to come up to us and talk. I think it gave us a very positive view of the people of Hungary and them a positive view of us and the United States as well.",1439137053

It is structured, and dense with information. It meets all the criteria of an intelligent transmission. Evolution and experience offer a variety of paths to follow, branch-points in the flowcharts that handle such input. Sometimes these signals come from conspecifics who have useful information to share, whose lives you&#x27;ll defend according to the rules of kin selection. Sometimes they come from competitors or predators or other inimical entities that must be avoided or destroyed; in those cases, the information may prove of significant tactical value. Some signals may even arise from entities which, while not kin, can still serve as allies or symbionts in mutually beneficial pursuits. You can derive appropriate responses for any of these eventualities, and many others.<p>> You decode the signals, and stumble:<p>> <i>I had a great time. I really enjoyed him.<p>> Even if he cost twice as much as any other hooker in the dome—<p>> To fully appreciate Kesey&#x27;s Quartet—<p>> They hate us for our freedom—<p>> Pay attention, now—<p>> Understand.</i><p>> There are no meaningful translations for these terms. They are needlessly recursive. They contain no usable intelligence, yet they are structured intelligently; there is no chance they could have arisen <i>by</i> chance.<p>> The only explanation is that something has coded nonsense in a way that poses as a useful message; only after wasting time and effort does the deception becomes apparent. The signal functions to consume the resources of a recipient for zero payoff and reduced fitness. The signal is a virus.<p>> Viruses do not arise from kin, symbionts, or other allies.<p>> The signal is an attack.<p>> And it&#x27;s coming from right about <i>there.</i>",1439136313

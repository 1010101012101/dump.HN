250916,comment,250704,250704,0,0,cturner,,,"I'm working for (somebody else's) startup at the moment and happy with my positioning there, but I've got thoughts coming from a number of these.<p>> 1. A cure for the disease of which the RIAA is a symptom.<p>I built songseed.com with the intention of creating a community for artists (perhaps with careers in other fields) who care about the music and aren't hypnotised by the Big Lie that artists get the sign and then make lots of money (something that happens successfully very visibly when it happens but so rarely that it's an extreme statistical oddity).<p>I'm obviously sending the wrong message in the way that I promoted it, because I found artists to be not very receptive at all to the idea of them giving away their music. IP is a big thing to take on as well. It's basically protection of the educated elite at the expense of consumers in general, and musicians are therefore very likely to be part of the grouping that benefits from it. (this isn't the language I use when discussing it normally - the about page covers that)<p>Some feedback has focussed on the basic and not particularly pretty UI. My theory is that content is king, and that craigslist never needed fanciness, and I hate javascript where plainness will work.<p>Then I got stuck because I couldn't find a cofounder I was happy to work with who was interested in it and I'm not very effective when I have to work in isolation. I also found that the dayjob I'd been doing in the meantime had landed me in another spot I'm quite happy with (software messaging and foreign exchange banking - I'm interested in both fields) and so I've neglected songseed.<p>> 2. Simplified browsing<p>I've been working on something to do with this just today. I have a feeling that Apple are going to create a platform on the back of Safari, and we have the new MS and Adobe thin platforms coming through. I've been playing around an idea for a while of creating a browser interface but one that doesn't require HTML or Javascript or DOM use for writing applications. I'm getting closer to realising this. I'm currently chipping away at the idea of an interface that works and is quite nice in the browser, but where you can develop an equiv. rich client frontends for it.<p>> 7. Something your company needs that doesn't exist.<p>Yet another thing I'm working at. Basically all document production systems you get at the moment suck because they don't handle styles well, except Microsoft Word which sucks because it's so heavy (offers features that allow people to do damage). This is quite incredible given how core document production is to what we do with computers.<p>Anyway - long story short - I've recently made a release of what I've been working on there at songseed.org. Lot of work to do yet. I want to develop a locked down word frontend to the engine.<p>> 17. New payment methods<p>Two thoughts:<p>- some sort of system that allows you to buy bonds on one-off contracts happening in a liberal country like switerland which would allow you to engage in contracts your gvt wanted to restrict you from engaging in<p>- some sort of trading system that mixed FX with a whole bunch of wacky synthetics to allow you to easily take positions on things which are normally more complicated. This would be interesting. FX APIs are a developed field as well so there's lots of software liquidity that you could hook into to get started.",1216503982
250915,comment,250704,250888,0,0,Alex3917,,,"Interesting concept. I actually interned briefly at CBORD a couple summers ago. One interesting thing I discovered was that small community colleges with cafeteria management systems took great pride in them. For example, several schools featured their systems on the school’s homepage. It's almost as if they believe that giving students a card to swipe to get into the dining halls is what makes one a real college. I don't really have any specific ideas, other than that you should play off the social status aspect at the lower end of the market. I know people selling software to colleges normally think first about the Ivies, but realize that your product is going to be one of the things that the smaller colleges get really excited about. I wouldn't be surprised if some of them actually started talking your product up on their campus tours.",1216503867

They have to rent a large amount of space in a high demand building for a weekend and feed everyone who comes.<p>Think about it this way: a medium sized wedding reception in a nice hotel can cost around $20,000. That wedding reception takes up one large room and lasts less than five hours. Now imagine taking up that entire floor of the hotel for 96 hours. It won't be cheap.",1216503138

250897,comment,250824,250824,0,0,mdasen,,,"Google's AppEngine is NOT a good option for a startup today and may never be a good option for most startups.<p>Today, there is no service level agreement; there is no way to buy more capacity; the service has rigid standards that can be unreasonable for many applications.<p>I like the idea of AppEngine for both reliability and scalability, but today it offers neither.  It has seen a good bit of downtime and it's limited to small sites (5 million page-views a month).  Without those two things, what does it offer?  Nothing that you couldn't do better on another host.<p>Probably more important are the rigid standards you must adhere to.  File uploads are capped at 1MB.  Someone tries to upload a photo larger than that and it just fails.  Likewise, the datastore isn't flexible.  Your advantage as a startup is that you don't have to worry about scalling to 100 million users at launch.  You can use things like database joins to make your development faster.<p>Not only that, but the AppEngine can't handle this simple SQL:<p>select * from articles where author_id in (:mike_id, :adam_id) order by date desc<p>Why?  Because you must order based on the first filter in the where clause!  Now, that's an important restriction when you're dealing with a petabyte of information.  It's just a handicap when you're a startup.  There are restrictions all over like this - restrictions that make sense when you're storing information for hundreds of millions of users.<p>Basically, AppEngine forces you to scale your app from day one.  That means that you loose your main advantage that you as a startup have against large firms.<p>And it just isn't that hard to set up a server.  Install Apache and a SQL database and start coding!  It's a lot easier than AppEngine's restrictions.",1216502075

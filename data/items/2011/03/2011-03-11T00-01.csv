Can't content farms be thought of as spam?  And, if so, don't the same techniques for spam identification apply, especially the ""mark as spam"" button in Gmail?<p>[Conjecture and speculation below as there's no evidence Google is going to modify search results based on users' blocking propensities, but I think the possibilities are worthy of consideration.]<p>I wonder how this scheme could be gamed?  Consider how one might game spam filters to cause a target's future mailings to end up marked as spam.  To hit a high-volume target, one would have to cause a ton of email addresses under his control to be placed on the senders distribution list.  Then, when messages arrived, he would mark them all as spam.   Although the total percentage of the sender's mailing list comprised of the bad guy's email addresses might be small, this technique would still be effective because the percentage of ""activist"" recipients required to flag any sender as a spammer is so low (at least I'm told).  To address this problem, Google could certainly apply schemes similar to those used to identify click fraud.  Such countermeasures would require the bad guy to make his attack appear more organic.  Have there been actual instances of such denial-of-service attacks?<p>With a similar strategy, could, say, an anti-abortion group enlist its membership to banish pro-abortion groups' websites from search results?  What if members were instructed to search for phrases like ""How to get an abortion"" and block Planned Parenthood, etc.?  The difference between websites and email lists is that the owner of an email list has direct control and could take countermeasures like changing mail servers, etc.  Also, large bulk mailers (MailChimp, etc.) generally have good relationships with large email box providers like Google and can therefore plead their clients' cases directly to a responsible person.  How would pro-abortion groups get attention from Google if their site rankings dropped due to such grassroots organizing?  Would Google be able to identify this as an orchestrated effort?<p>How would the behavioral patterns of pro/anti-abortion activists be any different than this forum's treatment of Experts Exchange?  Google will observe that one small segment of its userbase blocks the site in high numbers but another segment, when searching for the same terms (MySQL failure XYZ) click on Experts Exchange results?  Wouldn't users actually seeking information on how to get an abortion recognize the name ""Planned Parenthood"" and click on those same results which were blocked by activists?",1299804203

In house construction the electrician is contracted and will never be the one who'll wire you a new plug 10 years down the road when the house is already on it's 2nd owner. For commercial the wiring is already in conduit and done to blueprints. Why would a commercial electrician have incentive to document where every wire is, when there's already blueprints saying where every wire is.<p>Just an FYI I work in construction, and have done many jobs. I've worked full-time as an electrician and currently as a siding installer (moved country). On the side or through renovation work I've done: plumbing/gas, drywall/plastering, baton-insulation, roofing, framing.<p>Beyond a foreman's job the internet and smartphone devices are useless. Again a sole-operator (how I worked as an electrician) would gain benefit as you're foremaning your own jobs, which is where real-time ordering would be beneficial. I work with a company now and my being able to real-time order is irrelevant as we have a warehouse manager and the companies only deliver once a week to us. Anything beyond our siding materials, we get from home depot (AKA insta-delivery).<p>As an electrician I'd have rather had info on <i>why</i> a previous electrician had wired it that way. That takes more figuring out than the 5 minutes tracing the wires (unless you're chasing through a drywall ceiling, FYI that's where I first picked up plastering skills).",1299803955

That said, Xcode/OSX gives me the spinning beach ball of death at least as much as I get a crash to desktop in W7 and far, far more often than I get a BSOD in W7. The idea that windows crashes a lot is a myth hanging around from before they went to the NT kernel in XP.  Granted, it's a myth that was well earned in the Win 3.1/9x days, but still.  
The reality is all the major OS vendors (I'm including Canonical here) have reduced crashes to maybe a once a week occurrence or better.  Hardly an issue anymore.<p>As for the polish comment, it's really a matter of what you're used to and strictly a matter of opinion, but I find Xcode a nightmare to navigate compared to VS2010.  Sure, Xcode is shinier and looks better, but the UX is far superior in VS2010 (again, just my opinion).  I'm very much looking forward to a single window interface in Xcode 4.3.<p>As a developer, the killer aspect of OSX to me is the full blown *nix environment paired with high level commercial apps (like Xcode, photoshop, garage band, etc.).

My key point is that even if Intel can match (or beat) ARM from a technical standpoint (e.g., clock speed and energy efficiency), the company may still get disrupted due to ARM's unique business model. ARM's business model provides a benefit for OEM customers in the areas of cost, customization, and supplier-customer relations.<p>I recognize that it's not just ARM's business model that poses a threat; the threat stems from a combination of ARM's business model, its current technical advantage (in energy efficiency), and trends in computing, with a shift away from PCs (and the Wintel standard) to connected devices running Android and iOS. To your point, the shift away from the Wintel standard has significantly reduced the barriers (i.e., backward compatibility) to the adoption of the ARM architecture for OEMs.<p>(Note, ARM's recent ""rapid rise"" in the processor market is illustrated, in part, by the company's stock market performance, with a market cap that has grown about 5x over the last two years.)",1299803876

Apple is in no way preventing anyone from developing for Mac at this point since XCode 3.6.5 is still available for download and installation by any users of OSX 10.6 (Snow Leopard), and as evidenced by the availability of the iOS 4.3 SDK for XCode 3.6, they are not forcing anyone to upgrade to the new IDE just to develop for their various platforms.",1299803267

At the time XML was hot so Oracle, Microsoft, IBM raced to add native XML handling to their databases. It was going to be the next big thing. Possibly even bigger than big.<p>XML was really hot then and many other sins were committed in its name (e.g. SOAP).<p>Trust me, the ridiculous inefficiency of XML wasn't lost on developers working on XML technologies 8 years ago. Coming up with a more efficient binary XML format is easy. Microsoft had its version (if not several of them) and other companies had theirs.<p>The real problem was: politics prevented people agreeing on a standard so no standard emerged.<p>There was an eruption of creating standards based on XML (SOAP, XML Schema, XQuery).

Yeah, that's what happens when you develop OSS for windows.

Right now, I need to stabilize closures, finish the standard library, write more tests and optimizations.
I saw a comment saying: it looks like clean. Well it's different in 2 ways, LinearML is strict and every object is linear. In most languages (Clean, ATS, etc ...), linear types are used to encode side-effects, as an alternative to monads. This is not the case here, in LiML, every object is linear! sharing has to be explicit. This leads to 3 interesting properties:
1) message passing is cheap (no need to copy)
2) most operations can be done ""in-place"", which is normally not true for a purely functional language. This allows better caching.

They've been doing ARM processors with the exact same business model for the past 20 years.<p>The reason they're successful today is simply because they have superior technology in an area (power consumption) that is important for a quickly growing mobile markets.<p>Arguably ARM was a better architecture than x86 from the beginning but it didn't matter: after Windows/x86 got majority of the market share, the switching cost for a different processor were too big and Intel was doing a good job driving x86 in ways that mattered for that market (performance).<p>Only when a completely new market emerged (for PDAs, iPods and cell-phones) that was free from requirement to support legacy code, ARM found it's place because it delivered one thing much better than Intel with their existing line of x86 processors: power consumption was dramatically lower. It also happens that this was a core requirement for mobile devices.<p>We can't go back in time and see how ARM Holdings would hold up if they were doing their own manufacturing as well, but in my opinion the business model has a minor impact on their current success.<p>The most important thing is that they have a product that is superior to competition.",1299802090

2311378,comment,2309990,2311254,0,0,nostrademons,,,"The comparison isn't between straight-C vs. straight C++.  It's between C with a good glue language (say, Python or Lua) vs. straight C++.<p>If I want a linked list in Python, I do:<p><pre><code>  frobs = ['foo', 'bar', 'baz'].

The equivalent C++ is:<p><pre><code>  vector<string> frobs;

The reason people like these multi-language solutions is that Python or Lua is <i>much</i>, much more productive than C++ (as in, many times more productive), and yet the most programs have only a very small core that needs to run fast.  You can write that small core in heavily-optimized C, making it quite a bit faster than kludged-together C++, and then write everything else in Python.

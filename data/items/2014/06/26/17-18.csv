The default &quot;Int&quot; type should be part of that system.<p>You can then add Int32/Int64 or maybe IntNative to get to the built-in processor types, which then have built-in processor behavior, and possibly arithmetic overflow traps as an extension.<p>The current defaults are just nuts, IMHO.",1403805569
7950815,comment,7915748,7921504,1,0,monstrado,,,"Yes, the HBase scanners in Impala are not very fast, and we know that. This is an area that needs improvement to maximize parallelism, but as of right now there are a bunch of things on the Impala roadmap that takes priority (disk-based aggregations/joins, window functions, nested data, order by without limit) to name a few.<p>As for Parquet, that file format is not designed for streaming, but instead is like you mentioned, it&#x27;s meant for converting large datasets that you plan on running analytics on. Queries against data in parquet is _fast_, like really fast...I&#x27;ve seen queries go from 200 seconds down to 5 seconds by just converting the dataset to Parquet from text.<p>Concurrency in Impala is actually pretty good, and has always been a design goal from the beginning. I wouldn&#x27;t compare Impala to Vertica or other analytical databases just yet, there&#x27;s still a lot of room for improvement, but concurrency in Impala is much better than the other SQL on Hadoop engines (Hive, Presto, etc), and we&#x27;ve demonstrated that on our latest rounds of benchmarks.<p>BTW #1 - As I mentioned, HBase support Impala is pretty minimal at the moment, but still works fine for ad-hoc queries over small key spaces.<p>BTW #2 - hehe! I&#x27;ll let our marketing team know :P<p>BTW #3 - I&#x27;m not sure what you mean here, I&#x27;ll ask around to see if someone knows.<p>Thanks for your kind words!

7950756,comment,7950495,7950635,4,0,RogerL,,,"Also, he states that &quot;Lines that fit our data better will result in lower error values&quot;. Strictly speaking, that is not true. The error function is a mathematical model for reality; the result is a &#x27;best fit in a linear least squares fit&#x27; sense only. I.e you are fitting your model, not necessarily reality - what the data represents.<p>Sure, that is all implied in the article, and I don&#x27;t believe that the author is confused at all by this point. But I witness so many people just running a linear regression, claim it&#x27;s &quot;optimum&quot;, and go on to conclude grossly incorrect things. So I think it is worth stressing (repeatedly), that this is &#x27;optimum&#x27; only in the very strict sense of minimizing your error function.<p>Let&#x27;s take a problem I am working on at the moment - tracking an object in flight. The data is noisy, but in a complicated way. Yes, you have the typical Gaussian measurement noise, but then you also have outlier measurements that have nothing to do with the object you are trying to track. Blithely applying least squares unduly weights the bad measurements because of the distance squared amplifying the influence of points that lie far away from the real trajectory. I could run gradient descent on the data (we tend to use Levenberg-Marquardt), but boy, the output will not model reality very well. It&#x27;s optimum, but it is also wrong.<p>So, for my data, the sentence should read &quot;Lines that fit our data better will result in higher error values&quot;. Well, the relationship is more complicated that that, but you get the idea.<p>I&#x27;m not dismissing the article (I liked it), just discussing the next steps you have to start thinking about. If you know you have linear data with Gaussian noise you&#x27;ll get a meaningful minimum using this approach. If that is not true, then do not trust this to give you meaningful information.

My job was to receive all the reports from the ground and fan that info out thorough the HQ and our higher ups/sides.<p>The HQ was processing things like medical evacuations, support fire missions, contact reports. The way it was done was very inefficient, frustratingly so. For instance, a medical mission would go like this.<p>A unit would report an IED strike with critical injuries. The unit would pass a MEDEVAC request by radio to their company -> batalion -> brigade HQ (us). We would then be the dispatch center for the helicopters and synchronization of airspace and hospital and all.<p>When the request would come in, it would typically be ~30s to 1m after the actual strike. I would yell at an airman that would get up his chair, walk to the center map and with his rule, measure the distance in miles between the hospital landing pad and the strike. He would then compute ETAs and for the helicopters based on various parameters. He would then ask the helicopter HQ to send a chopper on site. He would then slowly type a message in a proformat, post that in the channel. That&#x27;s ~5m later.<p>When I was there, I&#x27;ve picked up VBA (VB for Applications), the macro system behind Excel.  I didn&#x27;t even know what a programming language was back then.<p>This 5min latency in sending the request to choppers, and giving back ETD/ETA info to the unit on the ground would result in people dying off their wounds, or staying in dangerous/exposed locations longer than strictly necessary (waiting for chopper ETAs).  This 5min latency was putting people at risk and killing folks.<p>So I wrote a tool to automate this man&#x27;s job, in VBA. I picked up the language on site and reduced that latency to ~15s.  Being the canadian army, they don&#x27;t give medals but I got this:<p><a href=""https://s3.amazonaws.com/antoine.im/AIR+WING+COMD+COMMENDATION+-+LT+GRONDIN+-+Aug+2010.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">https://s3.amazonaws.com/antoine.im/AIR+WING+COMD+COMMENDATI...</a><p>Then, I wrote tools to automate many other parts of the HQ, like a database to handle multiple concurrent critical incidents or a tool to manage airspace for fire missions.  Then I realized I liked this programming thing much more than running around with guns. Then I came back to Canada and started a degree in software engineering. Then I&#x27;m here today.",1403804520

So please allow me to refocus the discussion to the context of the original article. The article said:<p>> To redress the balance a bit, philosopher of physics Wayne Myrvold has asked some physicists to explain why talking to philosophers has actually been useful to them. I was one of the respondents, and you can read my entry at the Rotman Institute blog. I was going to cross-post my response here, but instead let me try to say the same thing in different words.<p>So in the context of the original article, &#x27;philosophers&#x27; are clearly those individuals who hold philosophy degrees, have offices in the philosophy department, etc. You know, those individuals that people usually think about as philosophers. This is the context I was answering in.<p>You argue that a good scientist should think about philosophical questions that have to do with the nature of his research, and not just about concrete scientific problems. I completely agree. I also agree that when a scientist engages in this activity he is doing philosophy and not science. Therefore, I agree that doing philosophy is important (and in fact necessary) for doing good science.<p>I do not think that science and philosophy are competing in any way, and I apologize if I gave this impression. My question of &quot;what have philosophers given physicists&quot; is entirely in the context of the original article, which tried to claim that it is a good idea for physicists to talk to philosophers (the official ones, yes?). I am simply asking for evidence that it is indeed a good idea for these two groups of people to communicate.<p>I hope these comments put us on common ground. We both agree that good things happen when scientists engage in philosophy, today. My question is what good comes of philosophers engaging in philosophy, today. If you like, we can broaden this question well beyond science, and ask -- what concrete positive things have philosophers (the official ones!) contributed to humanity in the last 100 years?",1403804119

In other words, its a really simple way to deploy X identical instances of an entire service/application. If <i>any</i> component in that instance of the application is non functional the container is dead and you route requests to a different container.<p>The problem with the &quot;one process per Docker instance&quot; logic is you need a great deal more service discovery logic as a result. There are a bunch of projects/methods to simplify this but at the end of the day it adds complexity to operations. Instead of a single health check to monitor, you have X containers to monitor.

The standard algorithm uses back-propagation to compute the errors associated with each layer of the network, and then the &quot;learning&quot; step shifts each parameter in the direction of those errors - just like gradient descent).<p>[0] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_regression#Least-squares_estimation_and_related_techniques"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_regression#Least-squares...</a>",1403803067

I like how you highlight the drawbacks of different types of visualizations and demonstrate that different visualizations can have different goals, and offer creative solutions for both.<p>One nitpick with the maze visualizations though. I found that the maze color flood animations have the same issue that you mentioned sorting has: animations are frustrating to watch because you have to wait and then rely on memory to recognize patterns. Specifically, I found the color scale rotation was much too fast to see large patterns, and even small patterns were too dense to be able to trace backwards after the maze had been fully colored.<p>I have an idea for an alternate visualization: Only show the fully colored maze (no intermediates), but vary the color rotation length over time from frame to frame. You&#x27;d be able to see color rippling through the maze and be able to follow the ripples over both large scale and small scale features.",1403802206

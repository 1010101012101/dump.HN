2222978,comment,2220133,2220133,0,0,Mikushi,,,"Interesting, but let's be honest for a second, in 99.99% of the cases, a classic Apache+mod_php will be well suited. You could count on your hands the number of sites that require a setup that needs to handle 12,000req/sec and more.<p>If you need to speed things up, reduce the memory footprint, i'd recommend using APC or eAccelerator, and put something like Varnish or Squid in front. As well as ditch stuff like WP or Drupal, might be nice and easy to use, but the code behind it is just a disaster if you want something fast and optimized. 
Use extensions like XHProf or Xdebug to profile your code, and find the bottlenecks and memory eating functions.<p>Stop blaming Apache/PHP, they both have defaults, but in most of the case, the default is in the code.",1297799990

But having a special command for this, and for other use cases, makes Redis somewhat less general. What I mean is that if we consider every added feature a cost (complexity cost, not development cost), why don't instead add a feature that allows for a use case currently not covered?<p>Btw there is an interesting pattern so you actually need to rarely send the LTRIM. Imagine this: you want a list to save the user timeline, you are interested only in the latest 100 messages. So for every entry you can LPUSH+LTRIM. But after all you can just LTRIM 10% of the times. Your list will fluctuate in length between 100 and 110, but as you access things using LRANGE the additional elements wil not create any problem. So the cost of the LTRIM, while already very very small, can be made 90% smaller with this simple trick.",1297799256

Currently, we have 2 solid contenders in the mobile market - Android, which is encumbered by lawsuits from a 750 lbs gorilla (never mind the 500 lbs) Oracle, and iOS, which is plagued by the departure of its iconic founder, Steve Jobs, whose presence and vision is what made Apple's redemption possible. Steve may be with us for some time longer, but eventually he will either retire or pass, in which case, doubts remain about whether Apple can maintain its innovative/technical edge.<p>The good thing about Linux is it is owned by no one, yet it is above everyone else. This is good for _you_, all of the posters here, who own a mobile phone/device/PDA/tablet/etc.<p>Mark Shuttleworth and Canonical has jumped on the Ubuntu on Wayland wagon too - and guess what MeeGo is based on? Yep - Wayland. It will breathe new life into Linux by giving a low-level, efficient display server that will supplant X windows, and establish a new legacy for the next 10-20 years of Linux being the premier mobile/desktop/server OS.<p>THAT is where you want to be going - into a future where no one owns the operating system, and it has become a commodity, and it has a solid GUI, much like OS X (or Windows, let's be honest, which has a top notch GUI), and a gazillion C++ or Java or whichever applications on it.<p>If Nokia Plan B happens, which I have no doubt it will, Nokia can succeed where Microsoft continues to fail - to recapture the hearts of developers by giving them C++, Java, Objective-C - any language, available on the mobile phone/tablets.<p>MeeGo is going to provide the default GUI shell for most if not all of Nokia's phones, but they can create a platform that is welcoming to ALL developers of all facets with knowledge of all languages, by leaving room for this on the MeeGo tablet.<p>There's no technical difficulty in being able to run either DalvikVM or native C++ or Objective C or heck, even Python or JAva apps on a MeeGo/Linux platform - it can all be designed in such a way where it supports both.<p>My point is, by providing the freedom for devs to do what they do best, on an OSS platform, Linux, and giving them a top-notch GUI API (Qt) w/bindings for various languages (dynamic ones for rapid dev), they can rise into a very dominant position in the next 5-10 years, and be a worthy competitor, and perhaps even carry the torch of iOS and Android, if the other two come to a sudden death because of lawsuits or health problems of its founders.<p>I am _super_ excited and thrilled that Nokia wants to make MeeGo its top platform, and in my view, you ought to be too.",1297799001

2222834,comment,2222454,2222767,0,0,TomOfTTB,,,"On ""B"" I have to say that's just character assassination and anti-intellectual character assassination at that.  It's perfectly acceptable from an intellectual perspective to admire some aspects of a person while disliking others.  Rand's philosophy was one based around rational self interest.  Rand's point seems to be that Hickman was the epitome of self interest yet was not rational (since it's not rational to turn the state against you by committing brazen crimes).  So she wasn't admiring the man she was admiring one aspect of the man.<p>Maligning a person for expressing this kind of thought is anti-intellectual because bad people do occasionally have good ideas along with their bad ones.  If you're dedicated to the intellectual pursuit of broadening your mind you have to be able to identify those ideas and admire them despite the despicable nature of the person who came up with them.",1297798537

It's positively criminal.<p>I understand the sentiment, but I don't think that kind of hyperbole advances the debate in any useful way. Obviously Microsoft are under no legal obligation to support an operating system first released many years ago and when two successors have been out for a while now. It may be <i>commercially</i> sensible for them to do so, but that depends on many other factors beyond the preferences of the web development community.<p>> Do you know what it's like to target IE8 with a web app that was built for a modern browser?<p>Yes, I do that for a living, on multiple projects, and so far I have encountered no serious difficulties in doing so. What problem(s) have you found with running ""a web app that was built for a modern browser"" on IE8?<p>> It has been a good... forever since MS has been a proper team player when it came to working well with websites that run on all other browsers with minimal modification.<p>So people often seem to say, yet I find very few portability/compatibility issues with running my web apps on any recent browser. I was surprised to find that in the last problem that did arise, it was actually IE that was compliant and Chrome and Firefox that were implementing non-standard behaviour. And as I noted before, IE is one of the only major browsers that <i>hasn't</i> been playing silly political games with blocking useful video-related technologies lately.<p>> This is closer than we've ever ever been in the past to having a remotely sane reality.<p>I guess we just have very different points of view, perhaps born of different real world experiences. In my world in 2011, we are closer than we have been for many years to the hell of IE vs. Netscape, everything working differently in every browser, and having no stable target for development. As I see it, the blame for this lies almost entirely with Mozilla, Google, and to some extent the standards bodies, not with IE.",1297798479

Its opponents can buzz in even if they are not completely sure that they have an answer (or they simply might be faster than Watson). It’s important to note that it is only possible to buzz in after the question has been read out. (Someone behind the stage flips a switch or something like that. Lights indicate that the buzzers are open for the humans, they are locked out for a few hundred milliseconds when they press the buzzer too early, Watson never buzzes in prematurely.)<p>I would like to know whether it is possible to beat Watson to the buzzer even if you and Watson both already know the answer. Watson has probably better reaction times but humans can anticipate when the host is finished reading. That probably depends highly on the consistency of the person behind the stage flipping the switch and opening the buzzers.<p>Here are some stats from the first round: Watson was the first to buzz in 16 times (with two wrong answers). It was above its buzzing threshold and didn’t manage to buzz in seven times. (It would have been wrong three times if it had made it to the buzzer first.) It was below its buzzing threshold six times. (The remaining one is the daily double which Watson got correct.)<p>This needs to be in a table. Numbers in brackets indicate wrong or potentially wrong answers:<p><pre><code>  Confident & first:  14+(2)
  Confident & beaten:  4+(3)
  Not confident:       6
  Daily Double:        1
</code></pre>
Edit: Some think that Watson’s (probably) superior reaction time gives it an unfair edge. I don’t really agree because fast reactions are simply a part of the game but I can sort of see the point that it’s not really about reaction times. We already know that computers can be better than humans when it comes to those.<p>I propose the following modification: One of the contestants who manages to buzz in in the first 100ms (the human reaction time) is randomly selected, buzzing in after those 100ms works as usual.

Funny, I just e-mailed some friends about how Apple was starting to get a bit of the stink of Evil about them.<p>As I read your comment, I was struck by how Apple does everything in a very one-size-fits-all fashion (Mac -> no window menu; iPhone -> home screen is a list of apps; subscriptions -> one revenue model).  There's a rich set of monetization schemes out there and Apple might offer a range of monetization models.  Apple could use an affiliate fee style model where App maker pays Apple $X for each subscription+.  Then Apple could just use the eCPM or expected revenue to rank search results (App gets a lot of subscribers and pays a healthy CPA, they get ranked higher).  App makers would then need to figure out how much $$$ to pay Apple for an install.  This could also apply to free apps [...but we've seen the harm that causes elsewhere].<p>Then Apple could add simple hosting/management fees for hosting an app's content.<p>+ I've been fairly heavily involved in the affiliate/CPA space, so know the kind of unpleasantness the model can bring, but am fairly confident that Apple could work around it.<p>[ed: formatting]",1297797573

2222751,comment,2221831,2222671,0,0,Silhouette,,,"> Out of curiosity: what's the ""right direction"" you think IE is taking? Stability over incremental updates? Or something else?<p>Well, yes, I am in favour of a certain level of stability over lightning-fast development. No-one who is actually developing web sites can use all the bleeding edge stuff the day it's released anyway, and releasing functionality changes every few weeks just means yet another round of reading release notes and blog posts to make sure nothing is about to break. I would far rather have a new version released, say, every 1-2 years, with a clearly defined set of new major features, and with every major browser implementing those new features at roughly the same time and <i>in the same way</i>. This is, after all, the point of standards. (Security patches can be released ASAP of course, but shouldn't change any functionality anyway.)<p>More than that stability, though, I feel that the IE team is focussing on better support for important technologies that are out there <i>right now</i> and experienced by real people and not just geeks and web designers who like the shiny new toys. For example, while Google, Adobe, Apple, and Mozilla are having a big pissing match and actively dropping support for various things, IE will be happily running Flash, H.264 in an HTML5 video tag, etc.<p>Along similar lines, recent versions of IE have dramatically improved both JS performance and standards compliance, so most arguments about IE being slow or needing things like CSS hacks are out of date anyway. Moreover, Microsoft have much improved their handling of security issues in recent years, and as I mentioned before, IE has long since moved to running tabs independently. I've been shopping on-line for a lot of networking components recently, and while Firefox has been my default browser for a while, I've been getting awfully tired of waiting around because one of the 20+ tabs I opened to compare products/prices was loading slowly and locking up the whole browser.<p>Apparently I've gone into super-verbose mode today so I'll stop there. Basically, I do think IE's approach to releases is more practically useful and sustainable, but I also think the IE team is focussing their efforts on technologies that are in widespread use today, while some of the other browser teams seem more preoccupied with bragging rights about trendy-but-currently-worthless new ideas and politics, neither of which ever did much to help real users trying to get real stuff done.",1297797548

Even outside a studio, a photographer has a lot of control over all of the variables.  Weather is about the only thing they don't.<p>To reduce photography to such extremes is akin to saying coding is pretty much typing.  By the time that happens, a lot of creativity has already been spent.",1308963506

""<p>Thats a fine objective for _some_ software. Twitter clients should be like that, the majority of what email clients or web browsers can be like that.<p>It's possible (probable?) that fully featured project management software can't be like that. There's too much external system level understanding required to expose everything the user needs to know about how and why to use the system in optimal ways to be able to encode it all in beautiful UX/UI.<p>Try and work out, as an exercise, how you design a UX/UI for a git client that'll allow a cvs or subversion user to ""pick it up with ease"". Some things ""just don't work that way"", and I'm reasonably sure project management, at least at medium and large scale, require user training (whether formal or self-trained-via-google, or through many iterations of trial and error).",1308963456
2694566,comment,2687950,2691958,1,0,jholman,,,"Your ""thin-layer"" analogy sucks.  I propose one instead that I think is about 10000+10 times better.<p>How about instead we take your 10kloc of code, and replace every char with a randomly-chosen char with the same rough shape (""w"" => ""w"" or ""m"", ""l"" => ""1"" or ""l"" or ""I"", etc).  And we publish that.<p>The new product has some interesting properties.  Information-theoretically, the new product has less entropy than your code, so it cannot be converted into your code.  It doesn't do what your code did (like let you recognize Miles Davis if you didn't already know it was him).  On the other hand, it's clearly derivative, because it uses _exactly_ the same whitespace, and the same line-lengths.  If you hold printouts of both of them side-by-side, from far enough away, you can't tell which is which... but if you get up close enough the difference is obvious.  One is obviously a technically-detailed work that had some specific requirements and took a lot of skill, the other is obviously and evidently less so (but still took a LITTLE skill, or at least effort).  If someone already knows the original, the derivative will call it to mind, but if they don't, the derivative is uninteresting.  The derivative clearly is a comment on the original, because otherwise it wouldn't exist.<p>Actually, I think I've got a pretty tight analogy here.<p>Why on earth would you be pissed off?",1308963409

Suppose you have a case in which the defendant has either specifically disclaimed ownership of the safe in question or disclaims any knowledge of the combination or has flatly refused to either confirm or deny ownership of the safe or knowledge of its combination on fifth amendment grounds.  I'm no lawyer, but I suspect the standard procedure in such cases is that the judge issues a warrant that permits police to access the contents of the safe and no burden is placed on the defendant to do anything at all.  Rather, because they have a warrant for the contents of the safe, the police are entitled to open it and they do just that, using a locksmith or mechanical means to force it open.  The analogous situation with respect to encrypted data would be that the police are welcome to crack the encryption themselves by whatever means they deem appropriate, but the defendant isn't required to do their work for them.",1308963354

In the Valley vested/exercised shares are equity, common stock, a true ownership stake in the company (see next paragraph, I'm not utopian about that means). Here, he lost his right to the stock after he vested and exercised. _No_ stock! That is profoundly at odds with industry practice that I just don't know where you are coming from in suggesting it's normal.<p>Standard tech industry practice does, true, allow insiders (at the time of the liquidity event) to play a variety of games to screw common shareholders. Generally, though, the bigger the event in $ terms (and this is big) the less legal room you have to play these games. For instance, as others have pointed out, you can low-ball the offer price but offer ""retention bonuses"" to current staff. And VCs always have their preferences. But if you keep these things on the safe side of the law, they are less and less impactful as deal size increases. I'd love to hear of a commonly employed mechanism that washes common to zero in a multi-billion dollar deal. I doubt frankly that it exists.",1308960252

You obviously have the ability to pull together data on all apps and comprehensively shut them off for passing some numeric ratio.

It's not a showstopper, but since this is your idea, I'm curious whether you think it needs to be addressed and, if so, how you'd go about it. Isn't part of the experience at a nice restaurant that you have a wait staff that knows the menu inside and out and can make recommendations? If you effectively have 4 menus that are all changing relatively frequently, it seems like you're asking a tremendous amount of the wait staff, which is either going to drive up your labor cost or make it nearly impossible to find waiters? After all, if you're able to familiarize yourself with 16 new menus a year to the point that you know how every dish is prepared and what compliments what, you can probably do something with more social standing. Do you see this as a problem?",1308960089

3164918,comment,3164434,3164809,6,0,matdwyer,,,"LOL - Again, I don't even focus on quality - our scans are 7 each, done in auto-feed scanners. I'm not talking technical at all, if it looks good, if it is a reasonable duplication of the original, then I'm good with it.<p>I'm saying that from my tests, doing the same photos with DSLR, point and shoot, auto feed, and high quality (epson 10000xl, creo, etc) then viewing on monitor, reprinted, ipad, etc. that there is a significant jump between the scans and the pictures. It is very noticeable, and 9/10 people that I talked to weren't happy with it (after seeing better options as well)<p>I'm sorry if I'm offending people here - I'm a gadget nerd first and I think it is cool. I've said that like three times. I just don't like how it is positioned as replacement of scans - if a user is expecting something that is better then what the service is able to deliver, they will be disappointed. Maybe I'm in the minority on that thinking",1319741996

Someone needs to look at how well Scribblenauts <a href=""http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/scribblenauts-remix/id444844790?mt=8"" rel=""nofollow"">http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/scribblenauts-remix/id4448447...</a> is doing on iOS vs. DS as an example. This affects the casual market for DS. Why spend $250 (can't believe they launched at that heinous console-level price) to play casual games?<p>Beyond that though, is terrible timing and business decisions on Nintendo's part. Remember the DS Phat? The 3DS actually sold really well initially relative to the DS phat.   What did well before were titles like Mario Kart, Tetris, and Jump Superstars in Japan timed during peak season with the release of the aesthetically pleasing DS Lite + the convenience of the r4. Then Nintendo went ahead and released 2 new versions to annoy customers. Now they release a 3DS and expect early adopters? Their main titles come now during the holidays and we'll see how well the system sells before making a firm opinion.<p>Additionally they're shelling tons of cash on Wii U whose innovation is nowhere near as revolutionary as the Wii. I demo-ed it @ E3 and there's simply nothing but a tech demo to showcase anything worthy of hype.<p>So, I think they've realized their mistakes. And it's not surprising at all that they've projected an annual loss. Also, 1st party games ported out? Never, I don't know why people keep bringing that idea up.",1319741882

Fact is, there are some of us who just don't have the extra cash to jump in (having spent it on an iPad, now irritated we can't do development for an otherwise awesome platform). Sure we could buy an old Mac Mini for a couple hundred bucks (monitor, keyboard, etc aside), but for that price we could be online with this service for 10 months! we also get the chance, for just two digits, to try out iOS development without getting a POS used box for hundreds of dollars which will go unused if maybe iOS isn't our thing after all.<p>I'm literally selling blood to buy a MacBook Air just for iOS development. It's taking a while...yet for 2% of that cost I can start tonight.

3164842,story,,,12,26,goshakkk,"15 year-old needs your advice",,"TL;DR<p>I'm a 15 year-old geek and developer from Belarus (think of it as of Russia). I care about perfect code and perfectness at all.<p>Let me tell something about me. I started coding when I was, I remember, 9. My first language was PHP (now I hate it though).<p>Some time later I started learning Python, in the hope to know more, and be more educated. That time I already knew I gonna be a developer. No other way. I kept myself being educated by new and new things about python, and actually about the web and computers. I learned many things, like linux system administration, the power of command line, etc. Most of all, I think I started seeing the life a brand new way.<p>Then, when I was in a search for something even better than Python (which, honestly speaking, amazed me a lot), I met Ruby. Well, I abandoned python and digger deeper in Ruby. I explored some part of big ruby world. I realized that Ruby is exactly what I want and what my perfect-aware nature need.<p>I learned Rails, then I learned MongoDB, and so. Pretty neat. Everything seemed cool, but I realize now I think I know many thing, I feel unwillingness to learn something new. I became too lazy and procrastinated, that's true.<p>But from time to time I feel new energy to learn something new, to make the world better. I do some research on what to build or what open source project to join but I end up with absolutely nothing.<p>As I told before, I gonna work at some IT company when I reach 18. Well can I ask you to give me some tips?<p>I doubt what open source project to join. HN suggested me before to help one of my favorite project to become better. I have many favorite projects. Some of them are complex and some of them are easy. While going to projects' pages at github I looked up Issues in a hope to see some feature requests. But most of issues was bug reports or pull requests. I didn't want to work on bugs, I wanted more to add new features. And again I ended up with nothing. Can you give me links to some interesting Ruby open source projects? Or suggest me ideas on what to build?<p>Another question is how can I minimize distraction and procrastination, get rid of laziness, become more productive and keep myself interested in learning new things and in self-improvement? Because I feel I have much power, but I do nothing with it. I waste it and my time.<p>Also I have some thoughts on my future. I have several options. First of them is to reach 18, move to San Francisco, Toronto, Vancouver, Melbourne, <any other city name> and work for an IT company. I have several companies in my mind, but most of all I feel desire to work at Github. Another option is to start studying at the university, Berkeley, Stanford, <any other university name> first, and then work for a company. Personally I think education now means nothing for a developer. But I'm wondering if studying is really worthy and can give me some excellent knowledge in Higher Math, AI, etc. So which option should I choose, what's your opinion?<p>Maybe I also should get rid of my perfectionism?<p>Thanks in advance.",1319741180

Hypotheses are <i>just hypotheses</i>. They can be wrong! They can be really wrong! The data will surprise you sooner or later.<p>Here's a hypothesis: If you put up this chart instead of the one that is there:<p><pre><code>  2GB:              $9.95 per month
  100GB:            $19.95 per month
  200GB plus Teams: $13.25 per month per user, min 5 users
</code></pre>
Here is what might happen:<p>A. On the margin, people with very small companies will tend to buy more Teams subscriptions.<p>B. However, that effect may be partially canceled out by the large companies that are subliminally turned off by a page that mentions only monthly pricing, not other kinds of pricing. Monthly pricing is great for individuals with credit cards, but company purchasing departments can work... differently. It might in fact be much easier to buy a year at a time than a month at a time just because of the administrative overhead and the culture of purchasing departments, and you'll absolutely have to use purchase orders and invoicing and get approvals, and if the vendor isn't set up for such a thing the whole process will be a huge ball of red tape, and gosh look at the time let's go out for lunch and talk about Dropbox tomorrow, or maybe next month...<p>C. Meanwhile, some of your potential 100GB customers will be <i>furious</i> that they are being charged so much money! They will stomp their feet and emit furious tweets and threaten to hold their breaths until they turn blue unless they get the $13.25 price.<p>D. And other potential 100GB customers will look at this and say ""hey, bulk discount!"". And they'll figure out how to band together with four trusted friends, and pull together a year's worth of cash at once, and buy a Teams account instead, and <i>whoops</i> now Dropbox is making less money on one Teams account than five 100GB accounts.<p>...and thus I wouldn't be too surprised if the results of A/B testing say: Leave the pricing page as it is.<p>...or, maybe Dropbox didn't actually test this page, and the more-straightforward hypothesis is actually the one that is right, and they could make even more money by switching to all-monthly pricing. ;)",1319741045

From the site:<p>""Todays troops often confiscate the remnants of destroyed documents in war zones, but reconstructing them is a daunting task. DARPAs Shredder Challenge calls upon computer scientists, puzzle enthusiasts and anyone else who likes solving complex problems to compete for up to $50,000 by piecing together a series of shredded documents. The goal is to identify and assess potential capabilities that could be used by our warfighters operating in war zones, but might also create vulnerabilities to sensitive information that is protected through our own shredding practices throughout the U.S. national security community.<p>Presently, a variety of techniques exist for reconstructing shredded documents including manual assembly, fully automated (computerized) algorithms and hybrid operator-assisted approaches. DARPA hopes to gain new insight into which of these or other innovative techniques are quicker and more efficient, and, whether the wide availability of high resolution photography, communication and crowd-sourcing strategies offer unexpected advances.<p>The ability to reconstruct shredded documents will potentially yield information that may save lives or offer critical information about an adversarys plans, said Mr. Dan Kaufman, Director of DARPAs Information Innovation Office. Currently, this process is much too slow and too labor-intensive, particularly if the documents are handwritten. We are looking to the Shredder Challenge to generate some leap-ahead thinking in this area.<p>The Shredder Challenge is composed of five separate problems in which the number of documents, subject matter and the method of shredding is varied to present challenges of increasing difficulty. To complete each problem, participants are called upon to provide answers to puzzles embedded in the content of reconstructed documents. The overall prize awarded depends on the number and difficulty of problems solved.<p>Registration is open to all eligible parties at www.shredderchallenge.com, which provides detailed rules and images of the shredded documents for the five problems. The twitter hashtag for this event is #shredderchallenge. Participants are encouraged to build teams using the event forum and to monitor www.twitter.com/darpa_news for the latest news updates.""",1319740992

Google Apps is wonderful for this, so I made an account there.<p>But I can not just ignore my old account, as I still get email sent to the address (I forward it) and I used the Google Talk functionality for my Jabber needs. Also, I bought my first Android apps with my old account, so they are linked to it. That means that I have to use my old account as the first one on any Android device, or I can't download my apps again.<p>What I would wish for is this: Have services that can be linked to any identifier/email, and shared between any number of them, so I could, for example, have two sets of email (one private, one business), but just one of GTalk, G+, Feedburner and Analytics.<p>I know that implementing this on top of the current system might be hard.

A variable would be a reference to a singularly defined property, such as a color or border style, not a hook to an entire list of properties. Certainly it could be used as a variable: that is, defining a class with a single property and hooking to that. But let's assume it's being used as a variable, why not write something like this?<p><pre><code>    .data { 
        font-size:11px;

I've inherited .magic into .data without sacrificing the ability to use .magic and .data by itself. As long as you keep your CSS classes semantic and disperse them intelligently into the markup, it's really not an issue of making large scale changes with minimal effort. Of course, in practice, this isn't always the case, but I think adding more ways to inherit properties will increase complexity more than help write good styles.<p>I think the outcry for these features is a symptom of a poor understanding of the cascade and the language. There are much larger issues I'd like to see addressed, like the wide adoption of layout definitions which has better rules for defining vertical positioning and more fluid widths, both of which are pretty nightmarish without resorting to tables.",1319739509

The jerk probably believes that the average day to day Muslim is part of the problem. Who is right? That's a factual question about the world. And if it turns out, for whatever reason, that the jerk is right and you are wrong would you then change your mind? Would being a jerk then be justified? Or would you still choose the non-confrontational route and avoid giving offense? Is your <i>true objection</i> that only the Muslims leaders are the problem or is it a mere rationalization for politeness and civility?<p>(Questions are rhetorical. I'm not defending the sexism in the FOSS world, nor do I judge you for being tolerant.)",1319738894

But that doesn't make iOS software free, either.<p>That is my point. They both have restrictions. RMS designed the GPL on purpose so that a third party is not able to place additional restrictions. Apple designed its devices so users can only install Apps by agreeing with the EULA first. One of them must relax the restrictions - which one depends on your ideology alone. I tend to side with RMS here<p>> RMS isn't complaining that Apple dissallows GPL software. He's complaining that they dissallow redistribution of the software on the device even where the authors desire it to be redistributable.<p>Eat your cake or have it. With a permissive license, you can install wherever you want, at the expense of ""freedom"" (for some definition of). Get a strong copyleft license and you cannot install it on some devices, but it will be forever ""free"".<p>I feel it is shortsighted to blace the blame solely on Apple, while ignoring the ideological war as a whole.",1319738887

There are definitely different cultural biases among human beings about whether environment of development matters most or ancestral lineage group matters most in making distinct human individuals more or less alike for the social purpose of grouping them by some commonality.

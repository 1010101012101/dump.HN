Some of my other designs (<a href=""http://mushpot.net/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://mushpot.net/</a>) weren't so well-received by HN..<p>It was just dumb luck (plus aesthetic help from my wife) that the box graphic came out as well as it did. I made it in OmniGraffle (mac drawing program), and I just kept playing around with the splines until I liked the shape. I'm just a programmer, so I tend to go with the simplest, bare-bones designs I can get away with.",1240388419

573665,comment,572943,573643,0,0,coffeeaddicted,,,"Well, yes - I have seen Unity 3D and as it exist already a little longer it certainly has already a few nice examples. But what I'm interested is more - why should O3D be outdated? Is there anything in their way of technology that would prevent doing 3D graphics as seen in Unity?<p>Also they seem to aim at rather different targets. O3D is about creating an open webstandard. Unity3D is a proprietary 3D engine that can run as plugin on some platforms (windows+mac). O3D has to be at a low level to succeed - basically offering a way for web-programmers to access the 3D capabilities of graphic cards with tools which they know (javascript). Unity 3D is an excellent engine with a real nice price, but it doesn't look like a tool for web programmers but like a tool for desktop programmers which want to have their desktop applications also running in a browser.",1240387390
573664,comment,573127,573598,0,0,jbert,,,"Seconded. That apache process is chewing cpu, is it spinning in an inf loop internally to userspace? No, strace shows it repeatedly doing backend conn/op/disconnect - aha!<p>Another trick in this vein is/was to use 'pstack' to pull a C backtrace from a looping process. If you do that every second for 10 secs, you'll probably find where the process is looping. As a bonus, it also acts as a poor-man's-retroactive profiler (process X intermittently takes 30s to handle it's job instead of 2s - watch for one and when it happens, strobe the process with pstack to see what it's up to). Can be used in production, no need to deploy profiling build and run for ever to catch problem, etc.<p>(And a variant of this trick for interpreted languages is to hook an unused signal (SIGUSR2?) in your language to say ""dump me a perl/python/etc backtrace to the log file"". Assuming the loop is in your app code this will give you a language-level backtrace if you strobe the process with the signal)<p>NB1: pstack doesn't do anything which scripted gdb couldn't do, it's just more convenient<p>NB2: pstack is unavailable on 64-bit arches?<p>NB3: pstack needs some symbols to work with in the binary, which probably won't be the case with your system apache+mod_xxx",1240387383

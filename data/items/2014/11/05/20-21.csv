8564217,comment,8563711,8563711,0,0,pdkl95,,,"There might be value in having an image[2] [container?] file format that is <i>explicitly</i> incompatible with EXIF and other metadata. This includes not having any kind of &quot;comment&quot; field or free-form data such as JPEG&#x27;s &quot;APP1&quot; location where the EXIF data is stored. It would specify only height, width, ppi, gamma, and some <i>enumerated</i> bitfields to identify the pixel format and any <i>necessary</i> compression options (i.e. lossy/DCT vs DEFLATE).<p>Even better, it should have some sort of self-checksum of the entire file, so it is harder (but not impossible, unfortunately) to extend the format beyond the original spec.<p>This would make it far simpler to encourage better behavior: the average person isn&#x27;t going to bother if you tell them to run exiv/exiftool. Instead, saying &quot;Normal image files are not safe! Only upload $SAFE_FORMAT files!&quot; will get at least some people to strip the files, and those that don&#x27;t should at least get a more useful sense of what is safe/risky.<p>In the (very hypothetical) future, once the format was used, it would even be possible to for browsers to explicitly deny upload of JPEG/PNG/etc or they could auto-convert other formats.<p>Security doesn&#x27;t work when it relies on complicated methods that <i>won&#x27;t actually be use in practice</i>, so changing the format of stuff that <i>is</i> used might be necessary.<p>[1] the same idea would obviously apply to audio/video/whatever files",1415221164

8564203,comment,8557958,8557958,0,0,tuxidomasx,,,"Wow, so many insightful comments here. I&#x27;m a black engineer and can relate to a lot of what was said in the article. However, I learned early on not to compromise myself to try to fit in. Instead, I knew the importance embracing one&#x27;s cultural community and always sought out like-minded and like-cultured groups with which to associate, as was suggested by Woodson in the &quot;Mis-Education of the Negro.&quot;<p>Upon entering the workforce, it was much harder to find that sense of community, so I started a black social network in my spare time so that I could still have that exposure. During the day, the only other black person I saw at my job for 6 years was the janitor. And I had a better relationship with him than the people I actually worked with...<p>My perspective is that it&#x27;s much more enjoyable and easier to thrive in a culturally homogeneous environment. And that it&#x27;s challenging to be a token member of a culturally diverse environment.<p>A decade of being a minority in technology has crystallized my opinion on the matter; I don&#x27;t believe that taking a homogeneous group and tossing in a few minorities is the best way to embrace diversity.<p>Instead, I am a proponent of encouraging the creation of a diverse set of culturally homogeneous groups. And yes, I realize that what I&#x27;m suggesting is basically segregation. The difference is subtle, but all the issues Erica lists in her article can be addressed by this shift in diversity strategy.<p>To paraphrase: As a black person, I would rather be part of a  mostly-black team/company than be one of the few black faces in a mostly-non-black team/company.",1415221046

Measles was a common cause of febrile seizures in the United States before the disease became rare due to the success of the vaccination program.\nDuring a febrile seizure, a child often has spasms or jerking movements and may lose consciousness. Febrile seizures usually last only a minute or two.\nThey are most common with fevers that get up to 102°F (38.9°C) or higher, but can also occur at lower temperatures or when a high fever is going down.\nFebrile seizures often result in a visit to an emergency room for the child and can be very frightening for parents and caregivers. However, most children who have febrile seizures recover quickly and have no lasting effects.</i><p>Which implies to me that the problem is MMR can cause a fever, and fevers can result in febrile seizures.<p>You should think <i>really</i> hard before trading off this risk for the increased risk of measles and mumps.  Rubella I&#x27;m not so sure about (I think the #1 reason for that is to protect pregnant women).",1415220938

I&#x27;m actually looking for a diary solution at the moment, so I&#x27;m your target user.<p>What are you trying to achieve with this? Why would people use this instead of a) keeping a private pen & paper diary, b) using one of the well-known blogging platforms? Not a criticism - I want to understand exactly what the use case is.<p>For my purposes (private diary solution), I&#x27;m trying to figure out if anything digital could ever be as good as the offline experience - just getting a nice LeuchtTerm notebook and putting pen to paper.<p>Because: why do I want to write a diary? For me, a diary is catharsis, and the process of writing helps me force clarity. It&#x27;s also a personal project that will delight me later on, once I have enough material to browse through.<p>So, what could a digital solution offer me that&#x27;s better? Indeed, two of the most important features of a diary are made worse by this solution: I&#x27;m dubious of your privacy standards (are entries saved in free text?), and it&#x27;s less personal to me. Organisation features (e.g. tagging) are of no interest at all - I want my diary to be a massive end-to-end mess that I can only dip in and out of, not &quot;search by tag&quot;. Finally, if this was ever going to work for me, the design would have to really stand out - e.g. something super minimalist, absolutely no frills.<p>Sorry if some of this is disappointing to hear!

Chrome has been somewhat of an utter disaster with clipping and based on the current demo, still is (things flicker in and out randomly).

You can start an asynchronous job via `jobstart(&#x27;name&#x27;, &#x27;prog&#x27;, [&#x27;arg&#x27;...])` which will return a job id. You can send data to the job via `jobsend(id, &#x27;text&#x27;). Every time the program has some output available, it will trigger an autocmd to let you process it. (This happens synchronously.)<p>We have refactored some of the code base using modern coding standards, which makes it more hackable. Some of these systems have become more efficient by, for example, using pipes over temp files.<p>We accept upstream patches in order to stay on top of vim, so I hope that no one will ever not use neovim because of a feature lacking (aside from a GUI--see below).<p>neovim creates a socket for each instance that external programs can communicate with, allowing one to write a plugin or extension in any language, providing it has a msgpack implementation. These plugins may eventually control things like the GUIs, spell checkers, syntax analysers, allowing nvim to become more focused, like a micro-kernel.<p>As of right now, many people have switched without having any real problems.",1415218863

This is true, it&#x27;s cultural. Some of their practices prefer manual and repetitive work over a style which requires a drawn out preparation involving planning and automation. If you&#x27;re paying $15/hr for highly skilled labor, that can make sense.<p>The other is racial, the belief that can become a part of that work culture, where people who do not work like that are inferior workers. Given the rarity of Indian work culture and cultures similar to it, it&#x27;s still cultural, but more racially limited. Someone of Asian descent, used to working in sweatshop style conditions, sees someone who doesn&#x27;t look like they&#x27;re used to it, and they assume the non Asian is an inferior worker, then it&#x27;s racial. It&#x27;s anecdotal, but I&#x27;ve been on the receiving end of both unspoken and spoken racism, veiled as cultural differences, about how North Americans are lazy and cheat their employers.<p>That said, I&#x27;m typing this out well aware of how this looks. It&#x27;s important to note that I know not all Indians are like that. It&#x27;s just a hard habit for people who spent 5, 10 years working long hours like that to break, and it&#x27;s not always easy for them to look at a worker creating equivalent output with different methods in less time and say &quot;yeah, that person works as hard as I do.&quot;",1415218021

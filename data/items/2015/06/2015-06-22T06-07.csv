The basic problem is we have more good scientists than the funding to support them - when the success rate of grants is less than 15% then the pressure gets extreme and also sorts of bad behaviour results.<p>As a bit of an aside grant reviews were apparently brought in initially to help scientists avoid working on bad areas. The idea was that everyone would get funded who put up a reasonable grant and they just wanted to help screen out the bad ideas so people didn’t waste their time.<p>We have since twisted this into the current system where we try to determine which of the top few percent of grants are the best. Of course the whole ranking process is so noisy that it is little better than chance for anyone in the top 25%.<p>A much better system would be to rank the grants as worth funding or not and then put all those worth funding into a lottery to choose who gets funded. At least this way even the losers would know they were on the right track and they were just unlucky. It would save an enormous amount of grantmanship and other activities that are the antithesis of everything science should be about.",1434956137

Other examples: Java for Android, Objective-C for iOS (Swift now).<p>You are worried by a framework monoculture, Rails dominating Ruby. That has no parallel in the JavaScript world. Other examples: iOS development dominating Objective-C and Swift?<p>The common worry is that monocultures harm their environment (JavaScript harming the web and Rails harming Ruby).<p>Given the success of Rails and the JavaScript-based Web one wouldn&#x27;t say any of those type of monocultures are bad for making money (and look at real monocultures in agriculture and animal farming) but farming teaches that if you don&#x27;t have enough diversity you are exposed to problems.<p>Being able to program the web in many different languages would be both good (pick the tool you like most) and bad (example: &quot;sorry, I can&#x27;t take over this webapp because it&#x27;s written in OCaml and I only do Ruby and Elixir, find somebody who knows OCaml&quot;) but not different from what we always did when developing for the desktop and the web server. Both did well. If we&#x27;re heading there we&#x27;ll cope with that (customers will stick with the &quot;big&quot; languages, as usual).",1434956002

They offer free classes on everything from breastfeeding to being a new dad. Heidi Murkoff has a corny but valuable and informative video series on YouTube where each week she tells you what&#x27;s going on with the baby. It&#x27;s good to watch each week with the wife, and her book has sold a zillion copies. 2 books I have are &quot;what to expect when your wife is expanding&quot; by Thomas hill and the other is &quot;be prepared-a practical handbook for new dads&quot; by Greenberg and Hayden. As far as your wife&#x27;s and baby&#x27;s nutrition, her doctor should prescribe what they need.

Some of them are written by people who have never even had children. Best advice I can offer:<p>1. If you find a problem, fix it. Don&#x27;t worry too much about it occurring to start with. Most of them don&#x27;t. Google is your friend here but stick to scientific solutions, not fad ones.<p>2. Don&#x27;t get embroiled in political parenting campaigns like &quot;breast is best&quot; and all that. Just do whatever is comfortable.<p>3. Regarding prenatal nutrition, don&#x27;t control it. Let her eat what she wants. Cravings are there for a reason. If you control it too much, a shrivelled rag will pop out without any extra body fat. Children get sick and need some extra incase they lose it. My other half lived on mixed grills and roast chicken and to quote our doctor, our children are abnormally well.<p>Edit: Couple more...<p>4. If you are sensitive to minor gore or bodily fluids, start trying to shake this now. They make regular appearances and you don&#x27;t have time to get iffy about it.<p>5.

Plan for sleep interruptions and discuss with your partner how you might manage sleep disruption so you both get <i>some</i> sleep rather than both of you getting next to none. Realize that nappies need to be changed a lot, you will get stains on your lush carpet and stuff will get broken. The amazing highlights you might already be imagining might make up 5-10% of the experience of having children - the other 90% ranges from the boring/mundane to the maddening/frustrating/despair inducing. Hopefully that 5% will outshine the rest, and for many people it will, but realize it won&#x27;t be all peaches and cream. And be prepared for CHANGE. In your life, your partners life, and especially in your relationship. You live by a whole different set of rules now, and special time together (just you and your partner), let alone time to yourself, may become a distant memory for a few years. Your partners body will change, and may never see its pre-baby days, your sex life will be hit and miss for a long time, and there is in fact a whole lot of stuff that will never be the same again. Be prepared to accept and deal with this change, and learn to love it.<p>Be realistic, and develop strategies to deal with the reality of having a second full-time job. I think this whole space is ripe for &quot;lifehacker&quot; style innovation, so go for it.

9756558,comment,9755683,9756326,0,0,atmosx,,,"I will give a Greeks view, backed by some facts, then I&#x27;ll express my opinion about what happened in Germany. Greece was never asked to take any burden. It was exploited and it&#x27;s still being heavily exploited because it&#x27;s politicians allowed this. Modern Greece is a protectorate. It has always been like that. It&#x27;s political class has always acted as a low-level lackey more than anything else. Of course the population is to blame too, but with so much misinformation receive by the tightly controlled media (Press Freedom Index says Greece is 99th bellow Kyrgyzstan and Gabon - no offense to these countries) by a small oligarchy, it&#x27;s only natural that the average Greek doesn&#x27;t really know what&#x27;s happening.<p>SOME FACTS<p>The &quot;bail-outs&quot; Greece received where the largest ones, but they were never meant to help Greece. They were made in order to save German and French banks. Less than 10% from the money received so far stayed in Greece. These money were issued in order for Greece to pay high-yielding bonds to Franco-German banks, until these banks were able to dump their bonds to the ECB. Basically they made a private debt (held by bankers) public (now is held by the ECB and by extension by EU tax-payers.). The result for Greece was that the public debt rose and sacrifices went largely unnoticed.<p>The German&#x27;s gov choice for a Greek technocrat PM was, Loukas Papademos. He acted as a middleman between the Simitis government and Goldman Sachs. Isn&#x27;t that a weird choice, from a country who accuses Greece of false statistics? I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s weird.<p>Christoforakos was not extradited to Greece[1] from Germany. I&#x27;d say that this again is a weird choice from someone who is taking a &quot;moral&quot; stance towards Greece, wouldn&#x27;t you?<p>I think Germany exploited Greece in every possible way, like getting paid for non-working submarines. Bribing politicians to get corporate contracts, etc. Add to that 1945 (second WW) German atrocities to all that, which is a theme revived by far-right and far-left political and social groups and you see the pictures. Some say that WWII doesn&#x27;t matter, but I&#x27;d say that it&#x27;s hard to swallow for people who saw their entire families annihilated and they&#x27;re still alive[3].<p>You could say that in the end of the day, it&#x27;s Greece fault. But that&#x27;s partly true. Greece has it&#x27;s own faults, of course, who doesn&#x27;t? But in many situations, it was never given a real choice, because in the bigger picture, Greece &quot;matters&quot; way more than it would be optimal.<p>Also here, we have to understand, that Greece has 400 years of Turkish occupation that left an incredibly strong cultural sign. Greece is literally a mix between western and eastern culture and this is something that takes many generations to change.<p>By all means, Greeks work more hours on average than any other European[4]. Yet they are mostly seen as &quot;lazy&quot;. Again that&#x27;s not the EU&#x27;s fault. Greece has a prime minister who literally took a tour of around Europe stating that &quot;Greeks are lazy, tax evaders&quot; (George Papandreou).<p>ABOUT GERMANY<p>Angela Merkel&#x27;s 2009 victory was largely based on the promise that &quot;Greeks will pay&quot; for their &quot;bad attitude&quot;. This &quot;hate speech&quot; (she literally called Greeks &quot;lazy&quot; among other negative terms) let to the largest CDU victory in their history. And she delivered, I mean Greece has already collapsed, the only who doesn&#x27;t know are people getting informed from the TV.<p>At the same times - as other people noted - German exports boomed. Unemployment in Germany became record low, because having countries like the PIGS inside the EU drove the EURO exchange rate down and Germany exploited the situation. It even borrowed money to Greece with a &quot;lower&quot; interest rate (which morally speaking, it&#x27;s like raping a dead woman.. but anyway).<p>After SYRIZA came to power, populist German media (mainly Bild, but not only) fueled the feeling that &quot;Greece is a household of people who party day and night and pass the bill to them&quot;. Merkel found herself against the wall because IMHO she would very much like to end this crisis with a debt-restructing and a New Deal for Greece... Because the numbers are not that big and ultimately the Euro is very positive for Germany, but how do you explain to your voters that you were lying all these years? That&#x27;s impossible. Every time Merkel (it&#x27;s Brussels but the quarrel is perceived between Germany and Greece mostly) gives away something the opposition attacks, every time she stands &#x27;firm&#x27; she risks finding herself in uncharted waters bringing Greece closer to default.<p>In the end of the day the problem was never financial. The problem is/was political. SYRIZA is in the same position: If it blinks it looses the majority overnight, if it doesn&#x27;t it will have to manage an extremely difficult situation (at least in the short-term, but will it survive?).<p>[1] <a href=""https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Christoforakos"" rel=""nofollow"">https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Christoforakos</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/10895239/Greece-sues-for-7-billion-euros-over-German-submarines-that-have-never-sailed.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/10895239/Greece-su...</a><p>[3] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distomo_massacre"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distomo_massacre</a><p>[4] <a href=""http://www.theguardian.com/news/datablog/2011/dec/08/europe-working-hours"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.theguardian.com/news/datablog/2011/dec/08/europe-...</a>",1434955061

The other is maintaining a healthy weight. Your wife isn&#x27;t eating for two, she&#x27;s eating for 1.1 or so. Although the crave-induced trips to the ice cream shop are fine for movies, being overweight is associated with complications during pregnancy and delivery. Not a doctor, this is just what I read as I read up on this during my own wife&#x27;s pregnancy.<p>Early child rearing is pretty damn basic. Feed the kid as much as they will eat. Breastmilk is best, but formula is better than not having enough. They sleep better when well fed, so it can make the first few weeks a lot less hellish if you have some formula on hand if your wife&#x27;s production isn&#x27;t up yet. There&#x27;s not anything else to it for at least 15 months from where you are now, so I wouldn&#x27;t sweat those details yet. You&#x27;ll have more than enough to deal with between now and then.<p>To err on the side of cautions, minimize the use of TV screens in the room where the baby is hanging out, even as background noise.<p>Hospital-grade breast pumps are more than worth the $90 rental fee.

I&#x27;m not saying I&#x27;m an absolutely stellar father or anything (contrary to the &quot;Best dad ever&quot; shirt I received for Father&#x27;s Day), but my son is very bright and healthy, and always seems happy to see me so I figure I must be doing something correctly. I might be a bit overprotective, but I&#x27;m okay with that.<p>One thing: I don&#x27;t know how much you tend to bring your work home with you, but that has to stop between the time you get home, and the time your child goes to bed. This was a tough one for me, since children aren&#x27;t nearly as intellectually stimulating as programming or reading - that said, I&#x27;m a much happier person for it.  I still read and program in my spare time, but only once the little one is asleep.<p>Also I found any books recommended to me to be absolutely worthless. Not saying there are no good parenting books, just that I haven&#x27;t read any.<p>Finally, congratulations! The fact that you&#x27;re already concerned with doing a good job tells me you&#x27;ll probably be a great dad. Like I said, just do what feels right :)",1434953239

I don&#x27;t think they fully appreciate just how long it will take them to meaningfully affect US oil production.<p>Saudi Arabia is an autocratic top down government with a bunch of lucky-sperm drones of the royal family welding absolute power. Saudi Aramco has a monopoly on Saudi oil production. That&#x27;s their mindset in this &quot;oil market battle&quot;.<p>But there isn&#x27;t a US shale oil monopoly or oligopoly that can respond rationally to this &quot;escalation&quot;. Instead, there are dozens of medium size oil companies in North America, and hundreds of smaller ones. It&#x27;s a highly fragmented industry. They&#x27;re all in competition with each other to acquire and develop the best oil and gas properties.<p>All those companies have CEOs that are well compensated, both in cash and in stock. The CEOs have all reached the pinnacles of their long careers. They like getting paid for drilling holes in the ground. The companies all have directors that are well paid to show up to a few board meetings a year.<p>Are these shale oil producers all going to decide to fold their hands against Saudi Arabia? Are they going to dissolve their companies, shut them down, walk away? Hell no!<p>With current low interest rates, many of even the most indebted shale producers have been able to roll over their obligations to 2020 and beyond. And even if a company fails, there will always be another that will quickly pick up the assets at a bargain price.<p>In the long run, US shale oil production will slowly decline as depletion exceeds investment. And various expensive &quot;conventional&quot; oil developments run by the US majors and the multinational oil companies will be delayed or cancelled. But that will take many years.<p>Things could stay &quot;interesting&quot; in the oil patch for quite some time.",1434953196

The learning for those engineers is to develop an understanding of how good is necessary, and how good is ideal.<p>If you find yourself rewriting your code a lot, consider using a technique that Pixar uses for making digital films which is they work on them on sections until they are &quot;good enough&quot; and they put that part aside with the label &quot;Good enough, could use improvement&quot;, until they get everything in the can, now the film is completely &quot;done&quot; but all of the sections can use improvement. They order those sections from most impact to least and start working through them. At any point they could just print the film and ship it, but the longer they work the better it will get. Often there are other parts of the pipeline that have to be aligned and so they will get a chance to knock off a bunch of improvements before it actually ships.",1434952953

Here is what helped me:<p>1. talking with my manager more<p>We have perf reviews every 3 months, and the review has 1-2 month delay. I recieved in spring a report that my perf in winter was mediocre. And then I recieved in summer that my perf in spring is worse. And I didn&#x27;t think it detiorated, so I came to him and asked &quot;Hey, how  did it get worse past quarter, because I thought I am getting better at this.&quot; And he told me about concrete project that he thought shold have taken a week or two and took month. And that after I finally finished it, the rest of my work-pace this quarter looks better.<p>2. identify the problem with your manager<p>For me it was, that I am able to get stuck on a task for a several just reading all the error logs without asking others for help. I know that some other team-mates had similar problem, so we introduced daily standups and more over I do my best to track whether I am trying to get unstuck more than one hour and if so, ask around for help.<p>3. I kinda embraced it<p>Everybody on the team knows that I am the one with wife and a kind that gets stuck on his work often :-) So, on meetings I allways ask after I have new task &quot;Who should I bug if I get stuck?&quot; and they know, that I am at work at 8 am sharp, but hell or high water at 5 pm I am already playing at home with my 1y old :-)<p>So, just talk about this with your manager.

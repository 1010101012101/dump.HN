What good is a fixed time period if you&#x27;re willing to extend it just because one company can&#x27;t pull their shit together?<p>As for the Kaminsky DNS bug, it was leaked more than a solid week ahead of the time he intended to release it. Sure, patches had already been released, but how about if other companies had said, &quot;We need a full month to test this patch prior to rolling it into production.&quot;? They would have been putting themselves at risk. Mind you, this bug was simply an extension of an earlier flaw - too small a range of transaction IDs, and some DNS projects (`djbdns` comes to mind) had already mitigated it (ostensibly fixing the root cause as opposed to the symptom). Had the other vendors mitigated that flaw in a similar fashion (they had almost a decade since djb pointed it out), they would not have been vulnerable. However, there was no looming deadline, so few of them even noticed until an actual attack was possible (as opposed to fixing issues as they come up).<p>What happens if someone leaks the bug early? Or if a malicious adversary discovers the bug at the same time? The whole idea of these deadlines is to force security bug fixes to be released ASAP, taking precedence int time and importance over all else.<p>Deadlines can&#x27;t be adjusted just so MS can screw around for longer doing nothing. If it&#x27;s really taking them more than three months to fix a bug and release patches, perhaps they need to rethink their priorities and dedicate more resources to the task. And perhaps we need to seriously reconsider our dependence on their products.",1421400708

That may seem like a bit of hyperbole, but go back and look at things like the invention of the transistor or the internet. Nobody perceived fully how impactful either of those things would be though they&#x27;ve transformed the lives of billions and spawned trillions of dollars in economic activity. If reusing rockets becomes feasible, and there&#x27;s every reason to believe it will be, then it will lower the costs of spaceflight by one to two orders of magnitude right off the bat. And that will vastly accelerate our investment, colonization, and exploration of space and kickstart a positive feedback loop of growth in activities in space (from infrastructure like GPS and commsats to human presence) spurring investment in improving space and launch systems which then increases activity levels (due to increasing capabilities and lower costs) which then spurs improvements, and so on. Ultimately culminating in mankind becoming not just a multi-planet species but a space faring civilization no longer confined to either the Earth or even this Solar System.

Just as your car has maneuverability without power steering, and your car has braking capability without ABS. But the grid fins increase the maneuverability a great deal at low cost, which is why they are used. They make it far more likely that the rocket can successfully hit a landing spot during a re-entry. So even though they add some weight and add some cost and add some complexity to the system they still increase the chances of recovering the multi-million dollar rocket hardware, which is a big win.<p>And the hydraulic fluid running out affects the impact velocity because the terminal trajectory of the rocket was controlled based on the assumption of having the grid fins working. When they stopped working they put the vehicle in a situation that was no longer controllable given the remaining capabilities of the rocket. If the power steering goes out on your car in the middle of a turn that&#x27;s much worse than if you didn&#x27;t have power steering at all, and could result in a crash.",1421399559

The concept of nations and of common humanity are abstractions to most of us on the level of idols or ideals.<p>As rulers have known since time immemorial: nations must be whipped into existence with all the tools of propaganda and religion. It must be clear to citizens that there are fearsome punishments for traitors and dissidents. And simple symbols must, through ritual and repetition; be imbued with mystical powers commanding allegiance.<p>And the economy as an abstraction of the economic health of the citizens is a tool of propaganda and of class war. When the owned media celebrate the economy, they are often performing a triumphal flourish for the ownership class; while the working class is being mugged.<p>Thus has it always been. But that is starting to change. All affinity groups can make themselves heard these days. The tools of media creation are so common that most adults carry them on their person all day long in the wealthier parts of the world. And those who have dreamt that they were the rulers are frightened by this. They seek to enclose the internet commons and drive us back into the feedlots of broadcast style media where the owners of the means of media production are the only ones heard.<p>People of the Internet; now is your time. Talk to each other. Create your own measures for the health of the economy. Ask the big questions. Are people being housed and fed? Is public health and hygiene being maintained at an adequate level?\nIs everyone you know free from the fear of starvation, homelessness and violence?\nHow about everyone who knows everyone you know?<p>By talking to each other; we render those who would arrogate to themselves the title of rulers, irrelevant.",1421399302

It&#x27;s not too late to revert course, but overfishing and pollution (acidification, in particular) have already changed our marine ecosystems, and they will continue to do so. Great diversity has been lost, while jellies and other more primitive lifeforms used to less hospitable conditions are now thriving.<p>The bizarre tragedy comes, in part, from the dilution hypothesis: it&#x27;s commonly accepted that the oceans are <i>really big</i>, so big that they can withstand our meddling. While the oceans are big, they&#x27;re neither that large nor are they totally homogeneous: there are many marine ecosystems, all of which are fragile. But most of these marine ecosystems are still large enough to change slowly -- too slowly to be immediately noticed by laypersons.<p>The slowness of change in the marine ecosystems makes environmentalism a politically difficult platform: good policies do not yield immediately measurable positive results, and while the threat is grave, it is creeping sufficiently slowly for action to be continuously procrastinated.",1421399005

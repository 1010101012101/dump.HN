Since one often write those words in conjunction, it is easy to mix the endings up. If you're then a non-native speaker and don't run spellcheck on your code, you might end up writing 'lenght' and 'heigth' quite a few times, I know I did :)",1326571187

The only politicians and companies that can be trusted when they say that they oppose SOPA are the ones who opposed it from the start. If normal citizens hadn't started the SOPA awareness campaign then SOPA would have been passed already.  The rest of these people are just jumping on a bandwagon to save themselves some bad publicity.<p>People need to realize that every single politician who decided to oppose SOPA only after the public applied pressure is a liar. These people supported SOPA with full knowledge of what it would do to the internet. The Obama administration has a ton of people who got to where they are because of the entertainment industry lobbyists. The next administration will too.",1326570875

By the time I've laced up my shoes, I'm in the workout mindset.<p>Really, vI know I can trick that part of myself. Trying to swallow a bitter pill whole is difficult and can be counterproductive to positive reinforcement that will get you to go again. Break down that commitment into pieces and the initial energy threshold is a hell of a lot lower.

It stops being a matter of ""I better see some results for all my trouble.""<p>Without the self-guilt trip you'll be reinforcing a positive feedback loop, which is the only sustainable way you're going to get in shape--if you enjoy doing it.",1326570833

Louie Simmons, the single biggest name in gorilla-style competitive power lifting, will tell you that 45 minutes is the max length of any smart training session.<p>But you cant spend the first 15 minutes watching CNN from the treadmill and the last 15 warming down.

[...]<p>The whole trick to athletic training  and this is true for everybody from bodybuilders to marathoners to noncompetitive athletes just in it for health, or even vanity  is timing each subsequent workout so it hits the middle of that so-called supercompensation peak, when a muscle has already bounced back even stronger than before but hasnt yet returned to baseline. [...]<p>It can be hard to believe a true strength coach the first time he tells you that by pressing and dead-lifting on even days, squatting and doing chin-ups on odd days, avoiding all other exercises, and adding a little to the bar each time, youll be stronger than youve ever been in only a months time. Thanks to the fitness industry, were so conditioned to equate sophistication with complexity  and to think weve got to work each body part  that our gut just says, No way; that cant work. But it works like magic, and the entire body hardens up in unison.<p>Finally, keep it simple; understand that variety is overrated. Variety does stave off boredom  its fun to mix in new exercises all the time  but a guy who hasnt trained in a long time, if ever, will get stronger faster on the simplest program of squats, dead lifts, and presses, three times a week.""</i><p>[1] <a href=""http://www.mensjournal.com/everything-you-know-about-fitness-is-a-lie/print/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.mensjournal.com/everything-you-know-about-fitness...</a>",1326569916

What blocking means is quite obvious; monetizing means that we put ads in front of the video and share the revenue; tracking means no ads are shown, but the owner can access analytics about the video (how often it is uploaded, how many people watch it, where from, and so on). You can read more about it here: [1].<p>As you may imagine, this system changes the incentives for copyright owners. When they decide to block some video, all they achieve is making some YouTube uploader unhappy. If they decide to monetize, on the other hand, they start <i>making money</i> from the upload, and the clip becomes, effectively, a marketing tool for their product. If you, say, watch clips from a TV series on YouTube, that may be a signal that you like the series and will eventually watch it on TV or iTunes. What is more, uploaders try to select clips they find interesting and think other people would like to watch so this in some way turns YouTube into crowdsourced advertising.<p>(Disclaimer: I work as a programmer at Google and I work on YouTube.)<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/t/contentid"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/t/contentid</a>",1326569770

NinjaVideo.net's sole purpose was to host high-quality unlicensed content, they would feature the unlicensed content, and it was clearly what was driving traffic to their website. If you never saw the site, just take a look in the internet archive:<p><a href=""http://web.archive.org/web/20100104054215/http://www.ninjavideo.net/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://web.archive.org/web/20100104054215/http://www.ninjavi...</a><p>Their frontpage was basically a list of links (the administrators curated and posted these links, complete with graphic banners like this: <a href=""http://web.archive.org/web/20100104054215im_/http://i47.tinypic.com/20zqp1g.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://web.archive.org/web/20100104054215im_/http://i47.tiny...</a>, and captions like ""the DVDRip is here!!! Enjoy"" and ""here's a Screener for you"") to stream whatever new content was on TV that night, or whatever movies had recently been released (sometimes even before they hit theaters). By simply taking a peak at their forum it was pretty clear that the administrators of the site had a relationship with the ""uploaders"" and commissioned them to upload the unlicensed content to megaupload where it would then be streamed in high-quality using the ""NinjaVideo Helper"" (basically a java applet that pushed megaupload content to the DivX web player). I'd venture to guess any DMCA takedown notices would be forwarded to /dev/null.<p>The clearest difference, imo, is that YouTube allows users to upload content (content can be uploaded without the owners of the site ever seeing it). NinjaVideo did not allow users to upload content, the owners added pages which allowed you to stream content hosted on megaupload (for any video to end up on NinjaVideo, the admins had to add it).",1326569312

Implementing the legislation OTOH may or may not stop piracy quicker, at the cost of a lot of collateral damage.<p>If lawmakers absolutely must legislate something, I'd propose to make laws that remove barriers and obstacles to implement those ""legitimate alternatives"". For example, set up globally centralized licensing to break down geographic barriers, or an official way to figure out from who you need to license a  song, a movie, code. Basically remove every obstacle between  the consumer and the licensor. If that happens, I'm willing to bet that piracy will be a fraction of the problem it is now.<p>But yes, you'll never eliminate it completely - but I think that even the most strident pro-IP people realize they'll never be able to banish all piracy from this world.",1326568742

There are other forums but last I checked adrforum.com is the most pro complainant as well as the least expensive (check, that may have changed but you won't find it for $9.95 or anything..). So if you need a lawyer to handle you need someone who specializes in this (you can write to me for suggestions). The cost for that is going to be in addition. That's if they take the case at all. The best ones might not take the case if they don't feel they will win because it will hurt their win rate.<p>""The current owner has yet to do anything with the domain.

That means they have to spend money and time. If the name isn't important they might just ignore the filing. In some cases when the filing is ignored the complainant gets the name by default. But not in every case. Sometimes the panelist(s) don't do that.

3464978,comment,3464484,3464484,1,0,radarsat1,,,"I actually kind of like the GIL.  It allows me to write threaded code in a ""lazy"" way sometimes, when I don't want to take the effort to do it properly.  (e.g. implementing a message queue using a simple list, using a global bool or int as a state flag.)  Even though it's not using the correct structures for these things, it sometimes allows to prototype a simple threaded approach quickly, and at least be sure it won't cause weird clashes in the interpreter.  When I want to later port it to a proper solution, I'll switch to the multiprocess model which forces you to use queues and other IPC mechanisms instead of shared data structures-- this is more effort, but usually worth it, if not for efficiency then for robustness.  But for one-off scripts and little proofs of concept it can be nice to just carefully share some variables and know with some assurance that you're not going to break anything in the run-time. That's not to say that transactional memory wouldn't be welcome, but sometimes the GIL allows a certain pragmatism in a prototyping scenario.<p>In Python, threads are ""enough"" to implement event-based concurrency, as well as asynchronous I/O and calling out to long-running C functions for number crunching.<p>Beyond that, the main reason to remove the GIL and allow true multicore parallelism is purely for efficiency reasons.  The catch is, if I'm serious about efficiency, I probably won't be using Python.  Or at least porting only my CPU-intensive functions to C.<p>Of course, if PyPy eventually provides Java-like speeds, maybe it makes sense to go this route, as Python could start to be depended on for efficiency, so the gains of true parallelism would be visible.  But removing the GIL from CPython seems kind of pointless, since the interpreter has so much overhead regardless.",1326568433

The Internet provides us with a means to share information quickly and cheaply, with a wider audience than ever before, and it allows anyone from a single person working alone to a global business to contribute that information initially.<p>But some things are <i>not</i> changing. Good content does not create itself. Most of the time, the best content is not created by hobbyists working in their spare time, either. We've been trying this experiment for a while now, and everything from Open Source software to self-published books paints a very clear and consistent picture: while there are the occasional gems, most of the work simply isn't very good by professional standards.<p>Creating the most informative, useful, interesting or entertaining content usually involves a lot of hard work. Often that work is done by a whole network of people with specialist skills. Often that work is not particularly enjoyable or glamorous. Often that work is not done by people who are going to reap vast rewards if the product is a hit, but rather by people paid a relatively low wage for their efforts. Still, the people doing that work have rent to pay and mouths to feed and interests of their own to support.<p>Now, I will be the first to agree that modern copyright laws in many jurisdictions have gone way too far in some respects. That is harmful to consumers, because it prevents them from doing otherwise reasonable things (or punishes them if they do those things anyway). IMHO, it is also harmful to businesses, because any law that loses the support of the public by going too far also loses any useful impact to the extent that the underlying idea is reasonable.<p>But a lot of the nay-sayers in this debate seem to see only the free side of this situation. They see that the marginal cost of distribution is now near zero, and conclude that everyone should be entitled to good content for free because it's out there anyway. They ignore, deliberately or out of ignorance, the often very high fixed costs associated with creating good content in the first place, or they decide (within some ethical framework that I have never understood) that it's OK for other people to contribute to that cost but they don't have to themselves. Then they rationalise their position with the kinds of excuse I mentioned before.<p>If this trend continues, we will develop an entire generation with a horribly damaging entitlement culture, and unless a viable alternative economic model develops sooner rather than later, content production will become a race to the bottom and good content (by today's professional standards) will become one of those mythical things we explain to our grandchildren starting with the words ""When I was your age..."".<p>This is not inevitable. All it takes to stop it is near-global standardisation on a fair economic framework that promotes the creation of good content. Whether that is copyright or something else is an interesting question. But as long as we confine the debate to a black-and-white ""Big Media Bad, Cheap Freeloading Good"" or ""Cheap Freeloading Bad, Big Media Good"" result, no real solution is going to get anywhere and we're just going to see a continuing arms race between commercial content producers and freeloaders with increasingly absurd penalties hitting the players on both sides when they lose.",1326568127

On the other hand, in the video linked in the article, he never actually claims to have written the questions.  He only says that he ""creates"" the exams (though, granted, his phrasing is a little misleading).  Again, as someone who's written exams before, I think creating an exam based on a publisher's bank of questions is a legitimate way of writing an exam.<p>As usual, I suspect the real truth of the matter is quite a bit murkier than is being presented by either side.<p>[1] Test banks and solutions manuals are frequently only made available to professors, so if the materials were obtained by pretending to be a professor, I'd definitely consider that cheating.",1290193064

Between all the bullshit in his article, what he's really saying is this: let's pay less for health insurance by transferring more costs to the individual.  I suppose you might support this if you're so deluded as to think lots of people are going to the doctors office because they're bored and have nothing better to do than have time consuming, often humiliating, uncomfortable to painful procedures and tests performed on them on a schedule that's extremely inconvenient.  OTOH, those of us whose heads aren't firmly buried up our assholes think that people mostly try hard not to go to the doctor or hospital because the experience sucks, and so the way this Dave asshole is trying to save money is by discouraging <i>you</i> from getting health care you need by making it cost more.<p>ps -- people who don't straightforwardly acknowledge that health insurance isn't insurance, it's group cost pooling, are idiots who should be ignored in the health care debate.  It's not insurance and shouldn't be because we can tell that in certain cases people will cost a lot of money to treat.  Insurance would leave them out in the cold.  Societies with integrity or conscience treat people anyway.  Compare to insurance -- if you build a house in a flood zone on the florida cost, you should probably be told hell no -- no company will sell you insurance.  If all the women in your family get breast cancer, we should still give you health insurance for when you get breast cancer.",1290191718

It's inevitable.<p>To be honest, I don't actively seek projects to work on at all. Every single one of my ideas has come from a problem, large or small, that has affected me personally. The idea in the front of my mind right now is so vivid that it has kept me awake at least 2-3 nights a week for the past 8 months. And it's not even complicated or revolutionary, per se. I'll even share - it's a note-taking app, like Evernote. I am learning how to code for the sole purpose of realizing this project.  If that's not passion, then I don't know what is. Sure, plenty of my ideas have already been implemented in some shape or form, but there's always room for improvement. That's how the world works. Google didn't invent search. They made it better. Apple certainly wasn't the first to build a smartphone. They just made it better.<p>“Our entrepreneurial motivation is not confidence, it's an insatiable desire to improve.

The fear after 9/11 cause many to reconsider what was reasonable encroachment on civil liberties. Everyone has an opinion on this. Mine is that it was seriously misguided and has resulted in egregious abuses.",1290189668

Would the administration implement the layoffs?  Classic agency problem.<p>Even if its exposed, the administration is part of the bureaucracy that furthered fake work along in the first place.  ie created fake groups and projects and ""moats"" in order to make it look like management was doing a great job and that a lot of ""work"" was getting done",1290189635

Yeah, the problem I think in most of these type of large systems migration choices is that they view only two discrete states, the present state and the target state -- and then try and build and plan for all contingencies. Some of the smarter ones try and define the target state primed to become the next present state with an eye towards a new target state, but in practice I don't think this style of thinking works very well.<p>In the Soviet example, they were looking at the present state of Japanese manufacturing capability and shooting for <i>that</i> as a target, while the Japanese were improving it every minute of every day. There is no goal in Kaizen, all that matters is the process of improvement. It's a very Zen way of looking at the world that I think thankfully is finding it's way into more modern principles of iterative development (it's amazing how ever-present Kaizen is in Western management training -- but I never got the impression that any of the texts really ""got it"", instead it's lots of discussion of studying it and trying to figure out how to adapt these two state processes to Kaizen principles without ever understanding the continuous nature of it).",1290189605

This only applies for being tried in NJ for the same crime.<p>No, because this wasn&#x27;t a prosecution under NJ law, it was a prosecution under <i>federal</i> law, in which the violation of NJ was an <i>element</i> of the offense. So double jeopardy prevents any further <i>federal</i> prosecution for the same offense, but doesn&#x27;t prevent prosecution under state law of NJ or other states (even though the court here found NJ law did not apply, federal circuit court precedent on <i>state law</i> questions is not binding on state courts.)",1397231967

7573655,comment,7572870,7572870,1,0,Snail_Commando,,,">One lesson of this tale is that capitalism doesn’t really work when it relies on the profit motive alone. If everybody is just chasing material self-interest, the invisible hand won’t lead to well-functioning markets. It will just lead to arrangements in which market insiders take advantage of everybody else. Capitalism requires the full range of motivation, including the intrinsic drive for knowledge and fairness.<p>Alternatively stated: &#x27;Capitalism, as we understand it, requires that market actors are enabled to realize the full spectrum of net-benefit desires. That no (intrinsically good) class of human desire should be inherently privileged relative to others. That intrinsic market biases which select for certain classes of motivation place an &quot;invisible tread&quot; on those that market machinery is not aligned for; the antithesis of the &quot;invisible hand&quot;.&#x27;<p>Under the assumption that capitalism is the best means of organizing and maximizing societal utility and productive output, people can look at the world through the &quot;market bias/full spectrum motivation&quot; filter and <i>still</i> walk away with remarkably disparate philosophical outlooks on capital market organization.<p>It&#x27;s troubling (or exciting, depending on your outlook) that Economics is such a young field. The optimist would say that there is so much to be discovered. The pessimist would say that our entire meta-organizational mechanism for the human species is predicated on a precarious understanding of emergent systems; an understanding with a high intellectual center of gravity. That it&#x27;s wrought by a legacy where positive and normative statements are considered, or at least perceived, to have the same scientific (or effective) impact within the field, and by extension, society. Not only are these types of understanding often traded pound for pound, but this legacy provides higher dimensional vectors of debate. A dimension that may (or may not) have any bearing in reality or analogue in effect. Often, these vectors are political, hardened by moral absolutism.<p>Statements like: &quot;Capitalism requires the full range of motivation, including the intrinsic drive for knowledge and fairness.&quot; and &quot;One lesson of this tale is that capitalism doesn’t really work when it relies on the profit motive alone.&quot; give us a skein of understanding of societal condition. On a surface level, they seem to be predicated on positive knowledge of market failures. However, by the vary nature of Economics in its current state, we cannot know how well founded these statements are. Market machinery, organizational dynamics, philosophical market doctrine have all evolved in a universe where positive and normative statements of understanding have historically had the same molecular weight.<p>The systems, taken whole, are inherently untestable. That is not to say Economics is doomed as a science. As a species, we are just barely figuring out how to remove our own biases from our understanding of emergent systems. There lies ahead a bright future for Economics. Perhaps some future Adam Smith will yield a <i>Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica</i> of behavioral economics-unearthing the underlying axioms of rational and irrational action in markets. Or perhaps some future son or daughter of ours will discover some novel underlying geometry to (or approximation of) chaotic systems, allowing our species to further unveil one of our oddest creations. Perhaps further integration with high horsepower computational machines will enable us to develop more experimental means of validation and understanding.<p>I suspect one thing is certain, any framework of understanding which values normative understanding as equal to or above positive understanding will likely end up at an intellectual local maxima. To put it melodramatically: we may argue over the rations as the lifeboat sinks. Did I say local maxima?<p>Of course, I have normative beliefs. Normative outlooks are inherent to the human condition. They are our attempt to abstract, approximate, and process information from systems that we do not yet fully understand. But I worry that my normative beliefs will delude me into thinking that my philosophy will help those in need, those for whom the market has failed, when I am in fact harming them. This is also to say that all normative beliefs aren&#x27;t necessarily bad. There are some that most people will agree with. If anything, this furthers the need to develop a positive understanding at the foundation of those beliefs. Imagine how much worse off we would be as a species if we dusted our hands and decided that there &#x27;should&#x27; be four elements, a universal aether, lobotomy, and a moral stance against vaccination.<p>For what it&#x27;s worth to this tangential rant, I really enjoyed this article.

Not having used Uber, my understanding based on articles is that it does not work like an order book at an exchange, where the price is determined by where buy and sell offers cross. Instead, Uber basically dictates the price, and then whoever is happy with that price will be matched. Correct me if this understanding is wrong.<p>What this means is that, as a first approximation, it is Uber that sets the price, not &quot;the market&quot; (whatever that is). Obviously, Uber still needs to take into account how both drivers and passengers react to the prices, but those are second order effects, and the resulting price is quite likely to be different from what you would get with a neutral platform that simply matches order books.<p>In the end, I guess this all boils down to the truism that &quot;the market&quot; does not exist.

I don&#x27;t really think so.<p>Let&#x27;s take another <i>outage</i> that happened this year to the Nobel Committee: This year&#x27;s Nobel Prize for the economics went to three economists, Eugene Fama and Lars Peter Hansen from Chicago (I hope Friedman rings a bell) and a third guy called Robert Shiller from Yale.<p>The thing is that the first two are renowned neo-liberals. They took the Nobel prize for their theory called EHM[1], which states that the <i>markets always now better</i> and to make a long story short &quot;all you have to know about a product, it&#x27;s written on the price tag&quot;. Which is of course is not true. Fama was the guy who made the 2008 wall-street meltdown possible. A meltdown that tax-payers still pay and will pay for the years to come. So does really this guy who had a prominent role in loosing financial restrictions which led to the 2008 crisis really deserves a Nobel? Are his theories real? I believe the result is there for all of us to see: Hardly, if the state has to intervene to save the <i>financial market</i> then apparently, is not as efficient as Fama thought it would. It does not <i>auto-adjust</i>.<p>The third guy though is famous for stating the exact <i></i>OPPOSITE<i></i> from the first two! Which is that the market doesn&#x27;t regulate NOTHING (otherwise moody&#x27;s, S&P and many others would be out of business today, giving triple A&#x27;s to Lehman&#x27;s products till Lehman crashed). Robert Shiller has become famous in economic circles by consistently disproving professor&#x27;s Fama&#x27;s theory!!! It&#x27;s insane!<p>So why did they gave a nobel to two guys who say <i>something</i> and a guy who became famous by disproving the first two??? I mean it must one or the other right?<p>Welcome to the beautiful world of economists (and not economics).<p>PS: I studied economics in Milan (Bocconi) from 1999 to 2003 but had to go home (change country) due to a health problems. Didn&#x27;t like it much though...<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficient-market_hypothesis"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficient-market_hypothesis</a>",1397231668

But they might feel like distributing the limited cab supply based on luck is more fair than based on who will pay the most.",1397231066
7573556,comment,7572981,7573342,9,0,barnabee,,,"This is in line with what I&#x27;ve seen in London - suffice to say it&#x27;s easier and cheaper to get a car around London than it&#x27;s ever been, the only people losing out are the black cab drivers who used to profit from what amounted to a monopoly on certain journey types.<p>Specifically:<p>1. Black cabs hailed on the street have a set (very high) price, only pre-booked cars can be cheaper. Uber and others are &quot;just in time, pre-booked&quot; services and so cheaper. Here, Uber and others are creating competition and improving the functioning of the market.<p>2. Uber have at least 4 (popular, at least with people I know) competitor apps in London - Hailo, GetTaxi, Kabbee and Addison Lee. All do similar things with their own take (Hailo finds black cabs with their extortionate prices and supposedly better service, Kabbee is an aggregator for many local and often very cheap minicab companies - but with highly variable service levels, GetTaxi I think is similar to Hailo and Addison Lee is a private car firm who employ a lot of drivers and have been around since long before Uber). All are vying for customers and responding to the competition with deals and pricing improvements - another sign of a healthy market.<p>3. The algorithms appear designed to find the most profitable sweet spot at any given time to keep prices as high as possible while minimising spare capacity - that&#x27;s sensible and how any company should (and do) act. Even if it&#x27;s irritating when surge pricing is in play, it&#x27;s completely reasonable.<p>I have 4 of the above taxi apps installed and pick the best one for each job - which often turns out to be Uber, so good for them.<p>Bottom line - you can never rely on one company to create a competitive market but if anything, the attention and lobbying Uber has brought to the sector seems to have created a fairer market and benefited consumers.",1397231062

Using nationalism and patriotism as a means to sell toys? Sure.<p>I can&#x27;t agree with the Transformers as much. I don&#x27;t recall anything specifically stating they were in America other than suggestions in the dialogue. With redubbing the show could have been placed just about anywhere only limited because of the appearance of the main human characters. I believe there was a British version as well. I could agree that maybe the Reagan administration co-opted Transformers for their own use (much like they did with the Star Wars name but I doubt Lucas was a government propagandist) but you seem to be suggesting that the Transformers exists for the benefit of Reagan&#x27;s Star Wars program. That&#x27;s the bit I&#x27;m curious about because I just don&#x27;t see that. It seems too conspiracy theory to me. My reasoning is that Transformers was a part Japanese effort and originally based off existing Japanese toys. It was essentially a Japanese company entering the US market. To say they were propaganda for the benefit of the US government is a stretch to me.<p>I agree with the stereotypes, but I would say they were more of the typical good vs evil stereotypes. Just because they matched the good vs evil actors of the day doesn&#x27;t necessarily mean they were created with that in mind. That seems some form of bias to me.<p>The reason the Autobots didn&#x27;t have energy issues like the Decepticons was because they weren&#x27;t attempting to conquer. They only required what was needed to survive. The Decepticons were gathering resources to destroy the Autobots on the planet, conquer said planet, and then return to Cybertron to finish the war. Works for me. I think it was the major plot point in several episodes.<p>I disagree with your final statement. There are many modern examples of more-or-less the same themes of good vs evil with similar stereotypes, archetypes, and plots. It&#x27;s just a lack of interest or failure in connecting them to modern events.<p>I just don&#x27;t buy the propaganda for government benefit in the Saturday morning cartoons from my childhood.

She had converted to Judaism, never went to BJU, and still she held that belief because of the moral panic in the 80s. It&#x27;s amazing to me how easily some people will accept a moral position on something they know nothing about simply because someone else told them they should.<p>I actually got her to play D&D with me. It was interesting. We sat down and set up the game, had little tokens for our characters (it was the starter set), and dice and all of that. We selected our characters, entered the dungeon, and were promptly killed by the first orcs we came across. We stopped playing after that, but I think it opened her eyes to the misconceptions she had of the game.<p>BJU would go into K-Mart and demand they stop playing certain radio stations because the students couldn&#x27;t shop there if they played rock music. They also caused a shitstorm when they tried to expel some students for holding hands when walking across campus because one was black and the other white, and this was in 2001. I even had a guy in my high school get into their weird religious beliefs trying to tell us in Biology class that the world was 3000 years old and the devil put dinosaur bones there to test us.<p>This is similar to the moral panic that happened around pokemon and harry potter in the 90s, and the daycare rape panic that happened in the 80s. It seems like moral outrage is a way that some people band together and identify.<p>It&#x27;s still happening now, my university I went to is being attacked for giving a summer reading book that is about a lesbian. People are viciously attacking faculty and alumni from the university, and the state legislators have even taken to fining the schools for it.",1397230540

That&#x27;s much much more than $1k. So there&#x27;s a strong financial incentive / golden handcuffs to keep you there for at least 1-2 years, even if you are unhappy!<p>After the 2nd year, the financial incentive of staying is still there in form of the large stock grant (which has grown due to their stock price rising) that you&#x27;ve been promised and waiting on for a long time.<p>I can see someone rationally and happily taking the incentive after the third or fourth years and quit (i.e. after they&#x27;ve done damage to the work environment as an unhappy/unmotivated employee, and no longer have to give a fortune back to the company)... but before then, I doubt it&#x27;ll change the behavior of any currently employed, overworked, over-paged, under-paid, under-appreciated software engineers.<p>Who this policy might affect though is future hires, and their perception of Amazon. People who have a choice between offers from MS and Amazon for example. They might consider this an interesting policy and assume that it would have improved employee morale at Amazon even though it&#x27;s common knowledge that Amazon has terrible work life balance, etc.<p>I should also note that the Zappos policy makes a lot of sense to me, but this is very different from that, as is the employee culture of Zappos from Amazon.",1397230489

So clumsy that often when custom allocation logic is required, standard containers are not used at all and custom containers are built instead. For example, EA has used a custom STL-esque container library to avoid memory allocation pressure in console and PC games.<p>> For example, you could have written equivalent logic that allocates odd_numbers on the stack or from a special memory pool.<p>But this example does not require any allocation space at all.

In any event on the family based side, which has a larger allocation than the employment based, it is Filipinos and Mexicans who face the longest waits, not Indians and Chinese.

And that&#x27;s just when they don&#x27;t anticipate increased revenues. If they anticipate $120k greater revenue versus expenses next year the stockholders can give themselves $120k worth of raises.<p>If there&#x27;s long term revenue streams, the stockholders can hire on family as consultants, enter the company into leasing agreements with companies that they own, and basically take anything that could be profit out of the company and it&#x27;s all perfectly legal and common for closely held companies.<p>The reasons are that the tax situation of the stockholders of a closely held company is pretty much the same either way, but any assets of the company can be taken via lawsuit against it, while the personal assets of the owners are protected via limited liability.<p>None of this is to say that these things are necessarily running through the stockholder&#x27;s minds. But not being a stockholder pretty much places any future revenue subject to the good will of the stockholders and it is not uncommon for people to make self interested choices when real money is involved.<p>BTW, being a minority stockholder doesn&#x27;t really change much absent an operating agreement which governs the way in which profits, bonuses and salaries are determined and getting that is unlikely.<p>Good luck.",1397229663

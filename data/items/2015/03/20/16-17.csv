People making a lot, but having to spend a lot, working in the Bay area, NYC, DC, LA, etc. etc., don&#x27;t have the options of keeping their salary and moving to a Cleveland suburb for the lower cost of living.<p>Even if there were enough jobs for people do it, they wouldn&#x27;t pay enough.<p>They are essentially getting a premium salary because they have to pay a premium COL. It&#x27;s not really a choice because the premium salary only comes if you work on the premium area.<p>So it&#x27;s not really accurate to call a developer who make 130k in Palo Alto &quot;upper class&quot; and call a developer who makes 70k in Arlington Heights, IL middle class.

What would we expect to see different between the societies, 1 minute, 1 day, 1 year afterward? Would there be any difference? Any new wars or suffering?<p>The only reasonable outcome in which the dust specks would be worse would be, admittedly, if there&#x27;s a non-negligible portion of the population that, as a result of getting the dust speck while operating machinery or doing something important like surgery, ends up making some terrible mistake that causes lasting harm to someone or themselves. In that case, the outcome is &quot;hey, some huge number of people got maimed or killed, so the torture of one is OK in comparison.&quot;<p>But my thought is that your line of reasoning would still be held even if all 3^^^3 people were given the dust speck when they are sitting alone in their room away from any potentially-dangerous objects.

Ever since Apple moved to unibody construction, their laptops have a build-quality that most laptops don&#x27;t even come close to. The ones that do cost just as much, if not more. That&#x27;s not the main reason I&#x27;d recommend a Mac though.<p>I&#x27;ve been using Linux in some form or another for just about as long as I&#x27;ve been using a computer. However, my Linux skills didn&#x27;t really take off until I bought a Mac. OS X is Unix (literally, it&#x27;s certified as a Unix OS). I found that when I was dual-booting Windows (this was before desktop virtualization), my primary cognitive investment was in learning to solve problems in the environment where I &quot;lived&quot;. I used Windows most of the time, and Linux for things like Apache and an ftp server that I used to share files with friends. The problem was, I only learned Linux while I was using Linux.<p>When I switched to OS X, my environment became more consistent. OS X isn&#x27;t Linux, but it shares a lot of similarities. If you buy a Mac, you&#x27;ll have a bash shell in both of your environments. You&#x27;ll use similar tools like package managers and command line utilities like grep, sed, and awk. You&#x27;ll solve little day-to-day problems with bash scripts, and generally become more comfortable with the terminal. This will translate to skills that you can use when working with Linux servers.<p>The other thing I would recommend is that you use virtualization rather than dual boot. Dual booting has a high switching cost. You have to shut everything down and reboot the computer in order to switch environments. Given the power of laptop computers today, virtualization is a great option. Free virtualization software like VirtualBox gives you everything you need to spin up Linux virtual machines, which you can experiment with, and even trash, without consequence.",1426867988

A $250k/year DINK couple should most definitely have very much to their name.<p>The only reason people could ever trick themselves into thinking $250k is merely middle class is because they assume that one simply must own a huge home to be middle class. This is a notion which I challenge. The middle class has never predominantly owned homes in major cities. The vast stretches of middle America have long been and continue to be the haven of the middle class, and this DINK couple should be able to buy a ranch home in that haven for cash.<p>This &quot;middle class&quot; family with the $2M home and the $250k income could sell that home, move to middle America, get a ranch home for < $200k with $1.8M left over, and retire, never working again. They probably have investments and retirement savings on top of the home, but even completely ignoring that they could get a $70k annual income just off 4% of that $1.8M. That already puts their passive retirement income above the median HHI in the US. And that&#x27;s ignoring social security, which when they come of age soon they&#x27;ll be able to draw at the maximum possible amount.<p>They&#x27;re not going to do that, though, because they enjoy the power, status, and income of living in the heart of one of the nation&#x27;s richest and most powerful industries and working for its top companies.<p>They paint themselves as victims, like they&#x27;re doomed to live in a horrid one-story home. They <i>chose</i> that. They prefer the perks of living where they are over the perk of having a huge house in a cheaper part of the country. The fact that they were even able to make that choice makes them not middle class.<p>Whether they&#x27;re &quot;upper class&quot; is another discussion. One can easily see various tiers in the upper class, with this family occupying the lowest one and billionaires on the highest rung.

It&#x27;s going to cost $x per core or host or something.  You&#x27;re going to build it,  you&#x27;re going to market it and you&#x27;re going to sell it.  Maybe there will be a free community edition to help market it.  I don&#x27;t know, but that&#x27;s the rough outline of the story.  Hopefully PHP is still really popular in 2 years...  Long lead time, product, then presumably you&#x27;ll know how to market and sell it.  Maybe my cold meds are fogging things, but that&#x27;s kind of ugly but it seems almost palatable,  these guys build compilers, without Pypy it&#x27;s super ugly.<p>Alternatively you could position it like a technology company.   This seems a lot more compelling, these guys have a great track record of doing great technology.  They&#x27;re doing legitimate cutting edge compiler stuff, routinely delivering it, routinely making improvements..  Tackling hard problems (like the GIL) and making headway.  If you&#x27;ve got technology to make unchanged php 2x to 10x faster, you can&#x27;t tell me there isn&#x27;t a market for that, Facebook is building that for themselves.  I&#x27;m sure Yahoo and others would be interested.  There are existing php accelerators on the market.   Plus, you&#x27;re only funding the development team so it&#x27;s a bit more inexpensive.  What you need is like a VC backed by Facebook or Yahoo one of those interested parties already looking at this stuff or a VC with the right kinds of connections with other tooling companies that might be interested in buying this kind of technology.  With their track record, it seems like a fairly safe technology play, they just need to find the right investors.   Now asking them why Pypy doesn&#x27;t accelerate certain types of code would be part of the process,  perhaps understand their strategy to avoid that problem with PHP would come up.",1426867596

From my perspective, &quot;torture vs dust specks&quot; doesn&#x27;t seem to be a thing you can just &quot;shut up and multiply&quot; on, because the impact of torture vs the impact of a dust speck seem fundamentally different. To me the negative impact of pain is not just the sensory experience on a purely linear scale, but the effect it has on a person&#x27;s life even afterward. It seems an overly simplistic model to put it on a linear scale, when there seem to be negative experiences that we easily &quot;bounce back from&quot; and others that we don&#x27;t.<p>When measuring the negative impacts of a speck in the eye, regarding its impact on any individual&#x27;s ability to achieve their goals in life or forget about the discomfort in the future, I have trouble seeing how a dust speck is anything but zero in those regards.",1426867251

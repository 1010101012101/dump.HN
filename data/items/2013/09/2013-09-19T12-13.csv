Most time isn&#x27;t spent programming anyway -  programmer time is spent:<p><pre><code>    a) fixing broken stuff that should not be broken
    b) trying to figure out what problem the customer actually wants solving
    c) writing experimental code to test some idea
    d) googling for some obscure fact that is needed to solve a) or b)
    e) writing and testing production code
</code></pre>
e) is actually pretty easy once a) - d) are fixed. But most measurements of
productivity only measure
lines of code in e) and man hours.
...
I&#x27;ve been in this game for many years now, and I have the impression that
a) is taking a larger and
larger percentage of my time. 30 years ago there was far less software, but
the software there was
usually worked without any problems - the code was a lot smaller and
consequently easier to understand.<p>Again in the last 30 years programs have got hundreds to thousands of times
larger (in terms of code lines)
but programming languages haven&#x27;t got that much better and our brains have
not gotten any smarter. So
the gap between what we can build and what we can understand is growing
rapidly.",1379595511

The idea was to repel untalented third-party developers from the console, and hence tighten the quality of third-party games. However, his plan backfired and merely increased the number of poorly developed games for the console. As a result of this, the Nintendo Gamecube was to take a step in the other direction, and provide an easy, smooth and intuitive programming environment for game developers.[6][9]&quot;<p>It would have been interesting to see Yamauchi-san carry on through the Wii and Wii U/3DS eras -- what would he have done differently than Iwata?

People hire someone based on something shiny they see on Dribble, and they get something shallow and shiny as a result.<p>However, in my case, there was actually a lot more thought about the feel I wanted to the logo to project than you give us credit for. My company is about making predictive modeling easy, for people who are non-programmers.  I wanted a look that was friendly, accessible, futuristic and high tech. I did spend a long time explaining to Ty Wilkins, my designer, what my business was about, and the feel I wanted to project.<p>We eventually decided that&#x27;s we go with a mid-century &quot;Tomorrowland&quot; version of futuristic, as a way of combining the friendly with futuristic. The robot came out of that line of work. Since 50&#x27;s robots were intelligent, it gets at prediction.<p>I think if you showed it to people they would come up with words like friendly. Eventually, I changed the name of the website to be Predictobot, to have a stronger tie in with the logo.<p>I did try hard not to be a back seat designer, since that&#x27;s why I was hiring Ty.  So the overall form of the robot is entirely his. The circle behind the antennas is to echo the &#x27;50&#x27;s TV antennas.  The orange is a warmer, friendlier color than more typical logo blues and greens.<p>So maybe I&#x27;m being naive, but I do think that we went through a good process of thought, that led to a solution that fit the brief. It wasn&#x27;t just &quot;give me something that looks good&quot;.<p>People do seem to connect with it. I don&#x27;t hand out a single business card without getting a comment on how they like my logo. It represents what <i>I</i> wanted to project for my one person business.

Hunt (1842), which settled that unions were legal in the US, dealt with the journeyman shoeworker Jeremiah Horne, who charged less than what the Boston Journeymen Bootmakers Society required.<p>It was legal for him to charge less, but then the Society would have called for a walkout. The master of the shop &quot;would not wish to lose five or six good workmen for the sake of one&quot;, so fired Horne instead.<p>So we have a union which is effective even against a shop of 10 &quot;boot developers&quot;, as it were.<p>Why do you think that unions are only effective in large factories?

So zBase is a direct competitor to Couchbase which is what Membase became.<p>One of the main advantage of zBase / Membase / Couchbase compared to many other NoSQL data stores is their strict consistency model (compared to eventual consistency in Riak for example).<p>This means that with a zBase/Membase/Couchbase cluster, if client A writes a new value to a key in the cluster and client B reads from the same key immediately afterwards, client B is guaranteed to (immediately) see what client A wrote.<p>While in eventual consistency models, client B might see the old value in that case (could be because the change might not have propagated to all servers in the cluster yet). If client B tried to read again a few minutes later he might then see the new value from A.<p>Strict consistency is required in a lot of applications such as game servers (which is why Zynga needs it).<p>For use cases that are more read-heavy, like holding the contents of a news website, eventual consistency is good enough.",1379593828

I love Android, and will probably never move back to iOS, but after having seen an actual phone with iOS 7 all my scepticism about the new UI disappeared. It&#x27;s a very beautiful UI. I was right there though laughing at the ugly icons (which I still think are ugly) thinking iOS 7 was a disaster until I actually looked at a phone and swiped around.<p>It&#x27;s weird. The iPhone 5s seems to be without a doubt the overall best phone out there. The low light camera, the processor, all that stuff blows me away, but yet I don&#x27;t want one.

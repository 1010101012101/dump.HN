5963407,comment,5962257,5962257,3,0,dobbsbob,,,"There was a worldwide fallout from the American&#x27;s setting up &#x27;Free Speech Zones&#x27; that all our supposedly free countries tried to imitate to squash dissent.<p>Even with constant stories in the media about how angry the corporate serf population was with blocking traffic in the morning for Critical Mass rides &#x27;Why can&#x27;t they do this on Sunday afternoon when nobody is around?&#x27; they were unable to set up these freedom crushing zones as the supreme courts ruled them unconstitutional, so instead they passed laws creating emergency national security buffers around consulates and government buildings, and in various high end retailer and business district areas that were designated emergency response routes, and a freedom killing law banning face masks during protests. Islamic protesters were solely blamed in the media for this new law, even though none of those protests were violent, and none of them were even protesting the government they were going after foreign consulates. The real threat of protesters with masks was anti austerity protests that turned into riots. They all started wearing masks when peaceful protesters attending anti austerity marches had their faces plastered all over the media while some pundit ran a slash piece about &quot;lazy protesters&quot;. Some of them were fired from their jobs once their face was in the media, of course not because of protesting but for some other minor reason so the company wouldn&#x27;t be sued. Some were also targeted by extremist right wing groups and had their houses lit up by molotovs.<p>When they did this every propaganda pundit was on the media arguing &#x27;Why do you have to hide your face if you aren&#x27;t a criminal?&#x27; and the serfs let it be passed with standing ovation because of Islamic boogeymen and the handful of anarchists that rioted. National security was a concern, the freedom zones and identity concealment had to be enforced.<p>This lasted for a few years until even the corporate serfs with total apathy towards anything the government was doing to squash dissent started being arrested or denied entry while attending major events like the Olympics or G8 zones wearing hats, scarfs, or even sunglasses as they were declared &#x27;identity hiding&#x27;. So many people defied the national security zones the police were unable to arrest them all then finally the party who brought in the law was tossed from office, the police chiefs quietly resigned with full pension for squashing human rights, and the identity law and security zones were repealed by the supreme court.<p>Now they are back to promoting these free speech zones and identity hiding laws again, claiming they are necessary to prevent two opposing political rallies from meeting each other on the street and starting a riot and to prevent vandals. They also want all protests to submit their entire strategy/plan of action to the police for approval first (yes, police approval) and of course the new police chief swears up and down he has no cares at all about crushing dissent he only wants an orderly population to prevent costly overtime and traffic problems. Nothing to worry about. They already swooped in and arrested the leaders of a Critical Mass ride who submitted fake protest routes to the police but they successfully sued for false arrest, so now they want a permanent law.<p>The same media pundit hacks are back on the air ranting at the lazy and entitled population for protesting and causing their commutes to be delayed. The exact same disinfo mocking identity concealment is being played out like these laws didn&#x27;t already all go to hell a few years ago.<p>If at first you don&#x27;t succeed, keep trying to squash dissent because the media has limited memory and of course isn&#x27;t talking at all about the first time they tried to do this and failed.",1372532240
5963406,comment,5962657,5962657,4,0,tptacek,,,"There are two widespread misconceptions about quantum attacks on cryptography. The first, which you avoid, is that it&#x27;s devastating to <i>all</i> cryptography; quantum attacks make some brute force searches faster, which would be a reason to consider AES256 rather than AES128, but do not directly threaten typical block cipher cores.<p>The second misconception is that quantum attacks ruin all public-key encryption. But that&#x27;s also not true. What&#x27;s actually true is that the most widespread public-key algorithms are mathematically <i>very</i> straightforward and are thus maximally exposed to quantum algorithmic advances. That implicates RSA, the classical DLP algorithms like DH, ElG, and DSA, and most probably their EC variants.<p>But there are many public-key algorithms that are not as mathematically straightforward as RSA or DH. McEliece is an example of a public-key system that uses binary error correction codes as a trapdoor function; lattice crypto uses the closest vector problem instead. These systems are all pq-crypto candidates.<p>It&#x27;s likely that if the day comes where, say, quantum IFP solutions can start addressing numbers larger than 21, we could swap RSA out of TLS for a pq public key system.<p>In the meantime, moving aggressively to pq public key is silly. We have a hard time just getting sites to use TLS at all, let alone TLS with forward secrecy. The post-quantum candidates we have now are significantly slower than RSA. A push for pq crypto today would harm security more than help it.",1372532226
5963405,comment,5962493,5963237,3,0,graycat,,,"Common problem.  E.g., how to &quot;aggregate&quot; data
in astronomy?  For a simple first cut answer,
work hard, get a lot more data, work hard,
have some good ideas, get a lot more data,
work hard, etc.  So, for astronomy, use
spectroscopy to identify the elements in the
star.  Use the brightness of the star and the
red shift.  Get empirical distributions of
various characteristics of the stars and
begin to guess that stars go through stages
and where the distributions are low the
stages are short.<p>So, start by observing, getting a lot of data,
and being just descriptive; economics
didn&#x27;t and still doesn&#x27;t do nearly enough
here.  Then look a little deeper
and start to make some sense of it;
economics has done next to nothing
here, necessarily so since they
didn&#x27;t get a good grade in the
first grade with the descriptive work.
For something with a little promise,
e.g., Leontief&#x27;s work , they don&#x27;t like
that and regard it as not 
acceptable in Economics Club.<p>So, with such work, in astronomy 
get HertzsprungRussell diagrams.
<i>Nice</i> progress.<p>Now, continue:  Take what is known about
weights in the periodic table and observe
that if press together two deuterium 
atoms to make one helium 4 atom, then
lose some mass and, thus, get some energy.
Keep this up across the periodic table
and see that iron has the least such
energy.  Observe that can keep 
pressing light atoms together to get
heavier ones, e.g., carbon, oxygen,
..., iron and get off energy.  Do a lot of
model building of the reactions in the
centers of distant stars.  Check with
the data, e.g., the HertzsprungRussell diagrams.<p>Eventually come up with a well tested, apparently
quite solid, model of stars.  A <i>lot</i> work,
bright ideas, spectroscopy, expansion rate of
the universe and red shift, nuclear physics,
etc.  Didn&#x27;t say it was easy.<p>Much the same in other fields of science that
have been successful.<p>So, if economics wants to copy that
<i>methodology</i>, then they need to get
their hands on more data.  Then, say,
they need to look at the <i>flows</i>
that, intuitively, appear to be
generating the data.  I know; I know;
too soon want a lot of curves on
<i>propensities</i>, and will have a tough
time there.  Not guaranteed to be
easy.  But neither were the other
sciences that were successful.<p>My view of academic economics is that they
sit in small, dark rooms with the doors
closed, hope for a single stroke
success comparable with E = mc^2 in
physics, dream up <i>models</i>, essentially
of imaginary economies, hope, but not
get very far.  So, they don&#x27;t want to
do the first, observational, low level
grunt work of data collection and
basic description that astronomy,
chemistry, biology, etc. did.<p>There have been suggestions that the
Princeton econ department has two
halves with one half, then with
Bernanke, the more <i>empirical</i>.  If
so, good for the Fed and the US
since we will be less likely to be
stuck with crack pot ideas from
&quot;defunct economists&quot;.<p>A danger here:  So, with such work
with imaginary economies, some
to be defunct economist makes a lot
of absurd assumptions and finds some
<i>optimal</i> solution -- maybe he
studied some linear programming
(Kantorovich, Solow),
Kuhn-Tucker theory (Arrow), Lagrange
multiplier theory (Debreu),
or dynamic programming
(Samuelson).  Then, seeing a real
economy and an opportunity for
fame, status, prestige, tenure,
lots of undergraduate co-eds for
secretaries, he takes the solution
from his imaginary economy and
says that that is what the real
economy <i>should</i> do.  Bummer.
Good way to kill tens of thousands
of people from unemployment,
busted homes, street crime,
infant mortality, drug abuse,
suicide, etc.  Incompetence
is a bad thing; incompetent economists
are really ugly things.<p>Your point about unemployment is an example:
Early on I looked at it and asked,
where the heck is the definition, that is,
the empirical or <i>operational</i> definition?
Next, one level deeper, what the heck are
we really counting?  E.g., might we be
partitioning the data in some way that
would be <i>better</i>?  So here what do we
want for <i>better</i>?  Sure, we want something
that can help us with <i>reductionism</i>,
that is, clear <i>causality</i>.  But the
actual unemployment data is so poorly
defined and so &quot;aggregated&quot; that our
hope for anything <i>causal</i> is just
smoking funny stuff, like the astronomers
calling stars just points of light and
not looking deeper with spectroscopy,
the periodic table,
nuclear physics, etc.<p>Finally I understood what the <i>empirical</i>
economists intended to do with data such
as <i>unemployment</i>:  They just said,
it&#x27;s a measurement; hopefully it is done
in a consistent way month by month;
we agree we don&#x27;t have a good definition
and that the data is too aggregated and
has basic problems in measurement,
but we just take the data as it is;
with the data, we will do just empirical
statistical modeling.  Then, recognized or
not, they have essentially given up
making unemployment data an input
to anything reductionist, causal,
or scientific.  Suckage.  Meanwhile
academic economists are driving
late model cars, and millions of
people are suffering from unemployment
likely for no very good reasons.
Suckage.",1372532183

The real problem is the abuse, not the topology of the Net/Web.<p>That is, even if we all ran our own email servers, etc., the government could work with the ISPs to protocol-sniff or otherwise hook into our communications if it had the will. At the end of the day, data must be put on the wire (or in the air). Outlaw encryption above NSA-crackable standards (as they did for exported browsers/software) and away they go. This is not to mention wireless carriers which must be centralized to some extent. At the end of the day, it is not a very practical matter for many of these services to be decentralized, especially for those who are not tech savvy.<p>And, yes, we could try to evolve technologies which decentralize more of these services for the masses. And, we can hope that endpoint encryption wouldn&#x27;t be outlawed (in fact, as we now all know, the NSA now claims the right to hold on to encrypted communications indefinitely as it attempts to crack them), but this is not unlike the cat-and-mouse between virus writers and antivirus companies. Stronger encryption would be cracked, data would traverse some centralized conduit, and the government would get the information.<p>The problem here is not the topology of the network, but the government&#x27;s intent and its frank violation of our privacy, period. We are a nation of laws, and the government should be constrained, not by the limits of technology, but to the law itself and to both the letter and spirit of our Constitution.",1372531421

If all you want is X Mb/s and you can accept it at a place convenient for the ISP, prices are well under $10 per Mb/s per month. That is, a 100Mb/s bidirectional handoff will cost you significantly less than $1000.<p>Now, a 7Mb/750Kb connection? The return bandwidth can&#x27;t be shared, so that gives you an idea of the contention ratio: about 1:10. The ISP is overselling their bandwidth ten times. This is probably reasonable for a consumer ISP. On the other hand, their cost for that bandwidth will be substantially under $7/month. The rest of the cost is going towards actually getting it to you, running a few services, customer interaction, and keeping everything repaired. Those other costs are relatively fixed -- it doesn&#x27;t matter how many megabits you&#x27;re buying, it costs the same per person -- but over-differentiating the prices seems to make sense to the marketing departments.<p>Pray for a sensible fiber provider, and in the meantime, don&#x27;t let your local government abdicate its role in regulating telecom services.",1372530926

And this error causes economic models to discount the role of these unlikely extreme events.<p>The Black-Scholes model effectively models stock prices as Brownian motion. This boils down to a single assumption: stock prices are the buildup of lots of very small INDEPENDENT random events (with FINITE variance) that occur over short times periods; this leads straight to Brownian motion. Brownian motion is indeed continuous; however, it is nowhere differentiable with probability 1. Because of the assumptions of finite variance and independence, the CLT tells us that returns will be normally distributed. So here, people pretty much agree that it&#x27;s always these assumptions of independence that cause these models to predict poorly.<p>This is totally different from chaos theory. First of all, chaotic systems are not necessarily complex. Here&#x27;s a chaotic map with a &quot;nice little formula&quot;:<p><pre><code>  f : [0,1) -> [0,1)
  f(x) = 2*x (mod 1)
</code></pre>
While this is chaotic, we can understand much about this map. For example, each application produces an entropy of 1 bit (see entropy of dynamical systems...). So this is a map that &quot;produces randomness&quot; in a way. This is philosophically nice, because probability theory itself doesn&#x27;t at all explain how randomness comes about.",1372530223

There are lots of little factors each doing their own thing with no shits given for the greater economy (or theory). Yet we can still make statistical generalisations that are useful in many cases. We can also design and manage monetary and financial systems that allow for unprecedented levels of human wealth and complexity. We aren&#x27;t quite sure precisely how these work, hell economists can&#x27;t figure out what the traders and bankers are up to half the time, but we do know where we cross from solidly-footed theory to still-debated hypotheses (even if nobody else cares for the delineation). None of this means that we can fix financial storms, though we have gotten much better over the decades. Neither does it prevent bankers and traders from innovating at the brink of theory.",1372529685

It happens to work on the same frequency bands that wifi uses, but their experiments did not actually use wifi hardware at all and actually used USRPs. Getting off the shelf wifi hardware to do the same would require firmware and drivers that allow raw access to the radio signals, which no cards I know of come even close to.<p>Additionally for their experiments they needed at least five antenna, so even if it were going to happen with phones you&#x27;d probably need more than just two.",1372529482

Android tablets might still defeat the iPad, but for now that's just talk.<p>What Google has done is provide an OS that let's the 'disintegrated' market show up at all, and achieve volume through low pricing and wider availability.  This is a huge achievement, because without them the other manufacturers would be lost.  That said, even if there had been no Android, could Apple have sold more iPhones? They seem to be selling them as fast as they are able to make them.<p>I suggest that major advantages will be conferred on whoever achieves greater synergies across the ecosystem of devices (i.e. makes devices work better together).<p>So far, neither platform has a decisive advantage here.  The question is, who is better positioned to move forward?<p>Google, who don't have a completed tablet story, are stumbling with TVs, and are struggling to contain fragmentation on their phone? or Apple, who have the Phone and Tablet well under control, are well on their way to bringing the desktop into the picture, and have a smoothly improving TV story?<p>If I were Google, I'd be trying to counter this using the Web and the Cloud - which we see them doing with things like Cloud Print, but it's not obvious how strong their strategy is yet, especially since they can't easily roll out new capabilities to their existing users.  That said, they could end up with a trump card (e.g. mobile payments).<p>The game is levelling up, and we have yet to see either side show their cards let alone stop the other in its tracks.",1301770616
2400656,comment,2399714,2399714,1,0,farout,,,"here are the three that within in a month you should be able to write some sweet apps quickly.<p>1. Head First Rails
I first poohed this book but I had read 7-8 other books adn still was confused so I thought what the hell.
I did each project several times and started making changes. Totally awesome especially the ajax integration parts. This is when I could actually make my own simple apps in less than a week.<p>2. I loved Agile Programming book - totally awesome. Not enough apps though. Great explanations. Gentle exposure to Ruby.<p>3. beginning novice to professional for ruby. I love this book. It is just plain fun. Good examples. I totally had fun with this. Peter is totally totally awesome - I wish he would write every tech book!!<p>Now you have the grounding, start making and asking questions.<p>What killed me was the UX/UI stuff. Then a friend suggested CSS Mastery book and using blueprint this got me clued in. Now I was not paralyzed. It was so awesome to see an app created in literally minutes.<p>I loved RoR - I miss it terribly. I disliked the community. Fanboyish. It was like being in all male high school with everyone thumping their chests and no help.<p>I still miss it very much. Whenever I code I first think in RoR then do it in php. My background was coldfusion, c#asp.net, java, etc. I need something dumb simple and php does the trick. And the people are nice and there are tons and tons of example to do anything. Also I needed something that is simple to deploy and maintain. Yeah yeah -RoR is easy to deploy - my first deployment took me several hours. Whereas php was minutes. In terms of sys admin and performance and optimization, I rather deal with php. As DBA, I do not really want an ORM. BTW when you feel good with RoR - check out Enterprise Rails - wow - good stuff on performance and optimization.",1301770615

2400635,comment,2400071,2400071,1,0,cletus,,,"I'm not sure why anyone bothers to read let alone make these predictions. Last week's was how WP7 would overtake iOS phones within a few years, the basis of which seemed to be to replace Nokia's Symbian numbers with WP7 units. Yeah, in-depth research there.<p>Frankly I'm more willing to bet money on Nokia fading into irrelevance.<p>Message to Elop: if someone needs to pay you billions of dollars to do something, it's probably not a good idea, especially when that other party will be getting most if not all of that money back in licenses anyway.<p>Another fallacy with such ""analyses"" is that they assume static goalposts. To me--and I suspect to Apple--smartphones are no longer what matters. In this sense they're much like the MP3 market. Sure, Apple dominates that market but it's just not of primary importance anymore.<p>The real prize isn't smartphones (IMHO), it's tablets. A tablet is much more of a general purpose device than a phone. I use my phone for calls, messages, checking my email and the maps/directions. I use my iPad for Web browsing, reading, research, watching movies, playing games and, well, basically <i>everything else</i>.<p>I think Android got a real leg up in the phone market because if you give someone a phone that makes and receives phone calls and SMSs then you've given most people what they need most of the time. Not everyone (with a smartphone) is into buying apps, music and other digital content on or for their phones.<p>Tablets strike me as different because that ecosystem is <i>far</i> more important. The availability of digital content, the suitability (eg hardware consistency) as a game platform, etc all advantages that are going to be extremely difficult to match anytime soon (IMHO).<p>Apple sold 15M iPads in 9 months last year. This year predictions are running at 40-50M (if not more). We'll start to get a better idea of this when Apple releases their earnings report in late April (and a much better picture in July).<p>I would put the competition for the iPad at <i>at least</i> 1-2 years behind the iPad and I'm not sure what'll happen first: 100M iPads (likely by the end of 2012 easily) will have been sold or 10M of <i>everything else</i>.<p>Back to the phone market: I think this is actually a reasonably conservative estimate in that I believe in 5 years it quite likely there'll only be two games in town (meaning with >10% market share), being iOS and Android, so I fully expect Android to have 45% of that.",1301770140

With Napster it was literally just start the program and point it at your music folder. People don't see it as ""fair"" that you can click twice and be doing the same crime as someone who methodically collected all the DVD copying hardware, bought disks, made the copies, found distributors and systematically created a business whose purpose and intent was completely clear.

Where is the ""accountability and reliability"" in your newspaper's classifieds? You think some editor at the Star Tribune is double-checking that that muscle car being advertised isn't actually a bucket of bolts?<p>The dominant ""mechanism"" or thought process I see getting thwarted on Craigslist is that since time-immemorial, classified ads (and really, ads in general) operated by the ethic of ""Here it is, if you don't like it then you don't have to buy it (also: shut up)."" Craigslist inverts this relationship and puts the power into the readers' hands: ""You don't like getting flagged? Feel free to post your ad on some other website."" This, I feel, is the most political thing that Craigslist has done: instead of forcing readers to overlook bad ads, it tries to motivate sellers not to write bad ads in the first place. That so many here are angry about having gotten flagged off in the past tells me that they were doing the bare minimum in writing their ad anyway. Good riddance, I say. It's not like Craigslist will die without whiners complaining about them.<p>By and large the people most frustrated with their Craigslist posting experience are those who just barf out a self-serving ad and expect the invisible hand of Adam Smith to protect their ""right"" to get $1200 for a Britney Spears ticket.<p><i>it seems like the user base is 50% there to flog newbies, and 50% there to make wrong statements.</i><p>If this was your experience, I'd look to the attitude of the person asking for help.

Plenty of those programmers work from home and don't have bosses, or they work for bosses who stay well away.<p>5. <i>Flipping burgers</i>. Unless you're a creative chef then flipping burgers <i>is</i> beneath your dignity, in the long run. Eventually this will come to be acknowledged by most people, just as having servants is no longer cool. The sooner we get robots to do the flipping, the better.<p>6. <i>Don't blame parents</i>. Plenty of hang ups are passed from parents to their children via anti-rational memes.  I would agree that we shouldn't <i>blame</i> our parents for this. (Blaming is the opposite of problem solving.)<p>7. <i>Tidiness and bills</i>. People shouldn't worry about tidiness, which, like shaving and personal grooming, isn't intrinsically very important. Ditto spending money on extra cars, expensive clothes and holidays, live sporting events, doing up houses, school fees, etc. Combating lice is a parental responsibility. Stop herding children into schools -- that would probably help!<p>8. <i>Grades</i> haven't been abolished just yet, although I think they ought to be, because they don't measure anything useful, and they cause a lot of upset.<p>9. <i>Eight hours work every day</i>.

The American culture has not been favorable to intellectuals socially, at least in my life time, 36 years. I believe most people tend to gravitate to what is socially acceptable. Also there is a sense I get from the political media, that intellectuals are to be demonized. Intellectuals generally seem to speak of complex problems, with complex solutions. Which are a hard sell in a form that seems to live off the 30 second sound clip, not to mention any ideological conflicts. And then there is the part where being an intellectual is hard work, it takes dedication, sometimes a complete lifestyle to gain, and maintain. Something that you'd have to put down the remote control, get off the sofa and go get. Its an up hill battle, TV, which is the most powerful form of dispersing to the people, what their culture is and thus, what they should be doing, to maintain their social status, is easy to do, more so than learning about a topic. Also the people making it, want to do what ever it takes, to make sure you keep watching instead. Then the people through ratings, tell the producers what they want to watch. So it is rather easy for this process to spiral out of control. The race to the bottom if you will. The internet has changed things a bit, it brought fame and glory to some smart people, the innovators and the builders, but I would still wager the vast majority is still tied up in social networking. Recently getting a twitter account I've noticed whats on TV tonight, seems to trend quite often.",1301767647

2400516,comment,2398782,2399965,2,0,noss,,,"That comparasion came to my mind as well. One problem with the prostitution law was that prostitutes now had to go into hiding, since their customers wanted to be more discrete. This led to an advantage for those working with trafficking, their prostitutes were outside society. Althought, I don't know any numbers on how prostitution changed because of this. I can definitely see how it would from above reasoning though.<p>For bribes, I can not think of something similar happening. The receiver of bribes typically offer a service they can't go underground with.<p>I've had my own thoughts about how to deal with the prostitution issue, where the goal is to look out for the prostitutes: Make prostitution legal; but only with prostitutes that can display proof of a recent health check and meetup with some social worker. That would of course end up becoming a government prostitution-permit-in-disguise, which together with the whole ""make prostitution legal"", would make a pretty though pill for the political climate in Sweden.<p>It would however give the social agencies and the police a better overview of the ""registered"" prositutes and their situation, so the police can put their resources into fighting prisoned trafficking victims (which I consider to be much more urgent and important), and the social agencies can identify social problems that led the registered prostitutes into prostitution and what keeps them there.<p>All in all, this might be a very swedish way to think about it, turning it into a tax paid government program.

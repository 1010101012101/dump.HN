1238576,comment,1237484,1238179,0,0,lutorm,,,"I'm not sure what you are arguing here. What would a world look like without simplification? You want people to remain in complete ignorance until they are judged at some point to be ""ready"" to learn the complete truth about something? That seems like an absurd viewpoint to me.<p>Besides, your comment ignores the fact that people, in the absence of explanations (right or wrong) will <i>make up their own model of how things work</i>. That model is just as hard to unlearn as an incorrect view they may have been taught by an instructor. In fact, they are probably harder to unlearn because they are based on the persons own experiences.<p><i>All</i> learning involves correcting and building on earlier concepts, there are no ""<i>tabula rasa</i>"". What is important is that people confront and integrate their own preconceptions as part of learning.<p>The National Academies Press book ""How People Learn: Brain, Mind, Experience, and School"" is a good, accessible introduction to these concepts. It's on the web at <a href=""http://www.nap.edu/html/howpeople1/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nap.edu/html/howpeople1/</a>.<p>This is a relevant passage: ""A logical extension of the view that new knowledge must be constructed from existing knowledge is that teachers need to pay attention to the incomplete understandings, the false beliefs, and the naive renditions of concepts that learners bring with them to a given subject. Teachers then need to build on these ideas in ways that help each student achieve a more mature understanding. If students' initial ideas and beliefs are ignored, the understandings that they develop can be very different from what the teacher intends.""",1270300563

1238574,comment,1238195,1238195,0,0,jdietrich,,,"If I could make a point on the subject of cameras, the market definitely isn't polarising into cameraphones and big SLRs. The most important thing that's happening in digital photography at the moment is the blurring of the line between SLR and compact camera and between stills and video.<p>Samsung, Panasonic and Olympus are attacking the incumbent duopoly of Canon and Nikon by building cameras that have interchangeable lenses like an SLR, but use an LCD viewfinder instead of a bulky and complex mirror and prism. By substituting complex mechanical and optical parts for electronics, the smaller players rob Canon and Nikon of much of their competitive advantage.<p>Further up the food chain, Canon and Nikon are making great efforts to take on Panasonic, Sony and JVC (and even Panavision and Arai) by leveraging their optical expertise to offer a lower-cost alternative to professional camcorders and even 35mm movie cameras.<p>I find it very interesting that in the compact digital camera market, the megapixel war is almost entirely finished - almost all marketing is now done on the basis of ease of use, low-light performance or novel features like face recognition or panorama modes. The cameraphone is certainly supplanting the digital camera at the low end, but the digital camera is also supplanting the camcorder.<p>In spite of what many might regard as a fatal blow from phone cameras that effectively cost nothing, the market for digital cameras is thriving because people are taking and sharing more and more photographs. I think we have a great deal to learn from what is going on in the digital photography market.",1270300471

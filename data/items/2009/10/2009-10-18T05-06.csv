888035,comment,887656,887828,0,0,jrockway,,,"I don't think anyone is ""bashing"" anything.<p>C++ has a weird niche.  It's as fast as C, but is as high-level as Java... at first.  It has exceptions, it has multiple inheritance, and it has ""methods"" (though C++ doesn't call them this, for some reason).  This makes it the perfect language in many people's minds; fast and expressive.  Unfortunately, the stuff that makes it fast is on all the time at the cost of making every function a potential foot-gun.  (I can convert an integer to a pointer at runtime!  I can remove ""const"", too...)<p>When you are writing code that needs to execute quickly, you don't want to do anything that's not related to the task at hand.  You want to shovel bits into the CPU as quickly as possible.  This means using native, unboxed types, not checking preconditions before every operation (""why would the preconditions ever not be satisfied?""), using trickery like integer-to-pointer casts, etc.  C works this way, and lets you write code that runs very quickly.  C++ works this way too.<p>The other half of a C++ app, though, is the complex glue code.  Most sections of a ""real application"" are complicated, but they don't execute often enough for speed to be too critical.  That's where you want safety; lots of self-checks, boxed types that don't let you misuse them, etc.  There is a lot of complexity to manage, and a team of programmers can't do it; so you want your language and runtime to help you out.<p>Unfortunately, C++ doesn't help you out; you are expected to write the non-time-critical sections of your application they same way you write the critical sections.  Ignore types, manage your own memory, skip polymorphism for speed, etc.  Those are all the default behaviors, and they make it hard to write reliable code.  (It is really worth overwriting random memory just to avoid a single comparison between an array's length and the index you are referencing?  In a video decoder, yes.  In the drop-down menu where the user picks the kind of TPS report to send, probably not.  But guess what the default behavior is.)<p>The failure mode of C++ is also quite severe.  In Java, flaky code that doesn't work just returns the wrong answer or dies.  In C++, flaky code that doesn't work can corrupt other parts of the program randomly, and it can even allow malicious users to inject arbitrary code.  There is no failure mode; the program keeps running incorrectly until something is so utterly wrong that the OS or machine kills the program.  (""Segmentation fault (core dumped)"".)<p>So basically, if you're using C++ correctly, for speed-critical sections of your application, you could just do it in C; and if you're using it for applications, you would be better off with anything else; Java, C#, Common Lisp, Haskell... all much better for higher-level code.  You probably won't notice the runtime speed difference, but you probably will notice the lack of random crashes because your off-by-one bug overwrote some global state...",1255844444

Let's say there exists Clojure code and Java code in the same project. The Clojure code depends on the Java code in one direction and then the same is true in the opposite direction. Given that compiling Java and Clojure require separate and different compilation steps, how would circular dependencies be resolved ? e.g. A class is defined in the Clojure code that references Java classes(yet to be compiled) and the same is true for the Java code referencing classes defined in Clojure(yet to be compiled).

888027,comment,887605,887753,0,0,evgen,,,"> The reason databases are statically typed is because that saves storage space and processing time<p>The problem with this argument is that when I can slap several TB into every node in my db cluster the storage cost issue is basically moot. When it is cheaper to buy ten small boxes than one beefy server the processing time and query optimization issue also starts to come into question.  At some point soon, and we may have already passed that point, the cost of centralizing db queries through a small number of expensive, highly tuned servers necessary to maintain the pillars of the RDBMS model will be outpaced by the benefits of abandoning both optimizations in favor of being able to use a small, cheap fleet of boxes running a distributed database.<p>The tradeoffs that were made several decades ago when the RDBMS and SQL ascended to their current dominance may have made sense at the time, but a lot has changed since then.  You may try to delude yourself into thinking that there are ""scalability problems a NoSQL system is going to run into that RDBMS solved 20+ years ago"" but given the fact that almost all of these systems were designed with an eye on under what conditions RDBMS failed and in light of decades of research into distributed systems and scalability that did not exist when SQL/RDBMS emerged I find it hard to believe that there are scalability problems that RDBMS solved that NoSQL systems will run into.  Hell, most of them were designed to solve specific scalability failures in big data systems where RDBMS fell over and died.",1255844007

888024,comment,887743,887743,0,0,dkokelley,,,"I think people are splitting hairs between SEO and SEM. SEO is what good web developers should have done. It's proper formatting, crawler accessibility, et cetera.<p>SEM, on the other hand, is link-building, keyword targeting, PPC campaigns, <i>quality content</i>,  et cetera. Basically, anything designed to manipulate behavior towards visiting your site.<p>SEO is perfectly understandable as a legitimate business provided it is services defined as above. It's just about making sure that the technical aspects of your site are in order. Still, I believe that this segment is shrinking, as search engines are getting better at understanding the sites and developers are getting better at optimizing their sites in the first place.<p>SEM is where the debate should be taking place. For lack of a better definition, SEM is about 'tricking' people into visiting your site, or otherwise 'gaming' the system. Those words might not be the best, but I hope their point is taken. (Note: 'Trick' could be read 'manipulate' or 'encourage'.) Quality content 'tricks' people into visiting your site. Link-bait titles 'trick' people into clicking. Back-links 'trick' Google into ranking you higher, which in turn 'tricks' others into clicking on your results more.<p>Point of order: I am not a professional web developer, and I don't sell or know personally anyone who sells any sort of SEO/SEM services.",1255843831

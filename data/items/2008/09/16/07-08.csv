I'm not suggesting folks here are a couple of paychecks away from being homeless, as I assume we're all of at least average intelligence and have some savings, good health insurance, and don't consider debt a fun hobby...just that we're all pretty spoiled, and we all probably have some expenses we wouldn't hang on to if our own personal revenue took a dramatic turn south.<p>But, I agree.  I hope that folks who work in volatile industries (like finance, or our very own home turf, technology, to give another example) are thinking ahead when times are good, and have an understanding that times will not always be good.  (You guys who missed the first bubble know that, right?  We will see another crash in tech.  Don't imagine human nature is so dramatically different this time around, or that enough of the folks who experienced the first one are still around and taking part to impart wisdom to prevent it from happening again.  It'll look different, because it won't be played out in the public markets, and the names will mostly be different...but it'll come, and not every high flying Web 2.0 company will survive it.)",1221551353

Although that would help for a while, it would soon be undermined. Capital markets are a prisoner's dilemma.  If everyone behaves, everyone wins, but there's just too much incentive to misbehave and win spectacularly at the expense of others.  With so many people playing, it seems impossible to avoid.<p>Unfortunately, 80 years, four generations, is just long enough to forget the lessons from last time.",1221549672

305530,comment,305515,305515,0,0,andr,,,"1) Jobs are investment banks and asset management are not risk free and not conservative. There is almost zero job security and - as seen - you won't know you were fired until the day you are. With small startups CEOs will communicate things much better and you can usually see things coming. Case in point, Lehman UK had a fairly succesful business, however all their cash was pooled in Lehman US. So on Sunday they got a call that their cash was no longer available, so they had to put a profitable business in administration.<p>2) They are not risk free, because your bonus depends on your performance (not in all segments, but in many your performance is directly measurable in money). No one cares about salary - it's all about the bonus.<p>3) You do gain a broad skill set working in finance. It probably looks very narrow and simple from outside, just like programming would look to a non-programmer.<p>4) On one hand, in a startup you create something tangible and in finance you are just a glorified broker. On the other hand, startup valuation is very chaotic and many startups would not exist if there were no bubbles. In finance it is very clear what you and your company are paid for and how much it costs.",1221548828

It's going to be be sited on the wall of the old bank opposite Kings College Chapel - anything quiet and unassuming in such an austere location would be lost.  Garish is good.<p>I was lucky enough to get a preview of the clock in operation about a month ago - guided by the clockmaker himself.  Two things stand out in particular.  First, the sound.  The clock has a really satisfying mechanical whirr and clunk.  A satisfaction that you just don't get by building software!  Second, the LEDs.  Bright blue LEDs mark out the hours, minutes, seconds. and they do so with sweeping movements across the clock face.  These sweeping LEDs are exactly that - LEDs that sweep.  It's not an array of LEDs that get turned on-and-off around the face, it's just some LEDs on a bar that is swung round mechanically.<p>Come and see it next time you're in Cambridge.  It's mounted behind bullet-proof glass on the wall of the bank.  There's even a special audio system so that you can hear the 'tick'!<p><a href=""http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?f=q&hl=en&geocode=&q=52.203852,0.117524&ie=UTF8&t=k&z=16&iwloc=addr"" rel=""nofollow"">http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?f=q&hl=en&geocode=&#38...</a>",1221548733

Did it really require experimental verification to show that meta-programming in C probably wasn't a good idea?<p>I find this sort of argument in general a bit straw-man-ish.

305527,comment,305349,305381,0,0,eelco,,,"The main problem is that both SQL and HTML are often simply represented by strings.  The programmer has to keep track herself to make sure everything is escaped and unescaped at the right moment.<p>The point is that you can use Haskell's type system to get guarantees about and keep track of escaping.  It's really light-weight to add new types.  Also, dynamic typing would probably mess this up.<p>Still, all this mainly comes down at the shoulders of the library designer.  But, looking at some of the available libraries (such as Text.XHtml) this works really well.<p>In the case of Text.XHtml the easy/default case when using a string in HTML is that it's escaped. When you want to 'parse' a string to HTML you'll have to be explicit.  That makes it really hard to 'accidentily' forget to escape HTML.<p>The way I look at Haskell's type system is that it's a great tool for easily enabling 'safe' programming.  It won't work automatically, but it gives you the opportunity to let the type checker take care of guaranteeing that everything will work as expected ;)",1221548588

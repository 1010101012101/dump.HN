113150,comment,112215,112650,0,0,jksmith,,,"No, you can computer more for less because of utility computing examples like Google. And I didn't say that having something that provides computing power in the home will go away, just that the value of you sitting down with your IBM PC-AT and running Lotus 123 will go away. When you claim that the desktop is better than the web, you had SETI@Home in mind?<p>And it is all about efficiently using computing power -- this will change your view on developing applications for the better. The sooner you accept that the web is a better path, the sooner you'll figure out to make web apps better, and we'll all appreciate your work.",1202690124
113149,comment,113057,113057,0,0,a-priori,,,"As someone who's been working in a ""stealth mode"" startup for the last few months, I can relate. It wasn't my idea to work this way, but my partner insisted. The reasoning is that there's two parts to the business and the other part, the non-technical one, won't be ready for public consumption for a while yet. Disclosing it now, when we won't be ready to fully launch for a relatively long time, could be disasterous. As mechanical_fish said, we'd lose a lot of perfectly good hype.<p>Mind you, I'd love nothing more to be able to answer people openly when they ask, ""so what are you working on anyways?""",1202689954

113146,comment,113018,113018,0,0,airhadoken,,,"For the purpose of commentary, let's assume that you're actually creating a product for the public.  1.0 means that this is the first point at which you're confident that the product reflects your vision for a first release.  It is feature complete (for all the features you haven't pared down or pushed back), and all of your known bugs from the beta period have been addressed.<p>Notice that I said ""known bugs from the beta period.""  If you haven't had a beta period, you're having one now -- you're not at 1.0.  I align with the traditional camp that considers beta software to be on a feature freeze.  They may not work right yet, but they're implemented.",1202689917

113144,comment,112973,112973,0,0,cawel,,,"My conclusion from the article: advertising in general will slow down, but not as much as in previous recessions, because of internet advertising growth (which arguably lags behind compared to offline advertising). Those are not too far-fetched speculations...<p>As a side note, when having a look at the GDP/ad spending graph, it's quite impressive to see how those 2 are correlated. The ad spending curve is (almost) always an ""exaggeration"" of the real GDP one!",1202689679

113139,comment,113057,113057,0,0,nostrademons,,,"Most are not.  I've been amazed at how much various startup founders have been willing to share.<p>Most, however, are selective as to who, what, and how they reveal.  If you've met a few times with a startup founder and gotten to know them, they'll tell you a lot about their future plans.  It's great to get feedback, after all.  You're expected not to blab that info about, but that's why they bothered to get to know you before telling you stuff.<p>There's no point to indiscriminately spewing your vaporware all over the Internet.  If you don't have a demo or UI for people to react to, you probably won't even get good feedback, and it'll lessen the impact when you actually do launch (case in point: Arc).  But if you <i>do</i> have something for people to react to, or you have people in a similar space that know your target market, you can gain quite a bit from sharing your idea.",1202689095

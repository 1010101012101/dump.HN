If it didn&#x27;t already matter which Verizon peering point they were using then it wouldn&#x27;t matter if any particular one was congested because Cogent could just dump the traffic on a different one in a different city.<p>Is your point that Level 3 isn&#x27;t a <i>Tier 2</i> network but Verizon is? Obviously Level 3 is going to peer with Verizon somewhere in Greater Los Angeles and Verizon would carry the traffic from there to Long Beach or whatever. But then you would seem to be suggesting that the Tier 1 network should be paying the Tier 2 network.<p>> Verizon isn&#x27;t a fake T1, it&#x27;s a real honest to goodness T1.<p>The Tier 1 network they own is not fictional, it is only not relevant. The traffic for Verizon&#x27;s customers in Los Angeles is not delivered to Verizon in New York.",1414544368

8524840,comment,8523550,8524389,0,0,ANTSANTS,,,">they will tell you that x86&#x27;s register-starvedness and anisotropic instruction encoding are huge losses.<p>Eh, not sure I buy that. Since at least the Pentium, x86 implementations have had very fast stack variable access compared to contemporary RISC architectures, practically treating some number of bytes around the stack pointer as registers. As Linus points out, everyone architecture has to confront this problem anyway sooner or later because some stack access is unavoidable; the x86 implementers just had to confront it sooner because of their ISA had half or less of the registers of the RISC architectures. So while of course it&#x27;s better to keep everything in registers if possible, I&#x27;m sure that the old Lisp compilers would have performed reasonably well on x86 if they&#x27;d tried instead of throwing their hands in the air and saying &quot;we can&#x27;t do it!&quot;<p>And the &quot;anisotropic instruction encoding&quot; makes so much sense that ARM adopted it (in a much simplified fashion) with Thumb-2. Fixed width instruction encodings waste a lot of space because the common operations need 2-3 more bytes than they ought to, and because absolute addresses and constants above a certain size must be loaded from an indirect access to a location close by the instruction stream, instead of just being inline with the instruction. Instead of 1 byte of instruction + 4/8 bytes of data/address, you get 2-4 bytes of instruction including relative address + the 4-8 bytes of data you wanted to access in the first place. All this adds up after a while, and at some point, the waste of code cache hurts more than the more complicated ISA.<p>I love 68k too (which had a somewhat &quot;anisotropic instruction encoding&quot; itself, by the way), but let&#x27;s give credit where it&#x27;s due: it took a lot of engineering talent and confidence (&quot;RISC is the future!&quot;) for Intel to prove that CISC chips could beat RISC chips on performance. It might have never been possible for Motorola to overcome their management problems and infighting to progress 68k at the zenith of RISC hype.",1414544303

8524833,comment,8510237,8510237,0,0,JackK,,,"Tenderloin is a district inside of San Francisco.  Urban and probably higher crime than what you want.  Rockridge is essentially Oakland.<p>Concord is safe but hot.  Good BART commute to the city, tho (one train).  Same with Walnut Creek, but more expensive than Concord. Another city like Concord would be Pleasant Hill.  Many parts of Alameda are nice, but you might be pushing your budget, and some parts are like Oakland (to be fair, the Oakland hills are beautiful, but likely outside your price range).<p>I&#x27;d look at Fremont, which is in the South East Bay Area, is cooler than Concord, and at the end of another BART line that goes directly to The City.  Fremont also has strong Asian and South Asian communities.  There are a wide variety of ethnic markets for those otherwise-hard-to-find foods, utensils, and spices and a wonderful selection of restaurants that have great food but aren&#x27;t too fancy for weeknight dining.<p>Public transportation in the Bay Area is concentrated in the larger cities and along the BART line, tho.  If you are more than a few blocks away from BART in the East Bay, you can expect to need a car, and are likely to need a car to go grocery shopping as well, due to the sprawl of suburban living that also makes it lower crime and quieter than The City.  Many suburbs are large enough that it might be easy for a wife to become practically housebound without access to a car.  Every place she might want to go might easily be too far to reasonably walk.<p>If you look at a map, Sacramento is way too far, though I have seen some people try to car commute from there.<p>Oh, and don&#x27;t expect to drive into the city!  Parking is a nightmare and very expensive.  It&#x27;s really easy to get towed or have your car damaged (or stolen) there as well.  Best to expect to ride BART to a downtown SF job coming from the East Bay, and to use a car to get to BART, because the more suburban parts of the East Bay have unreliable bus service that tends to be ~ once an hour and not on time enough to use for work commute.",1414544190

It also seems to have been reduced back to 160mg.<p>A few of the &quot;Pure Zero&quot; variants seem to have (or had) a ludicrous quantity of caffeine.  If I have any complaint (well, other than that a 16oz can doesn&#x27;t have 2 servings worth!) it&#x27;s that I don&#x27;t know that the caffeine should really differ between them; one might not expect what seems to be simply a different flavor to differ markedly.  My solution to that has been to read the ingredients.<p>> Even at 240mg it&#x27;s equivalent to or less than a cup of medium strength regular coffee. And not close to Espresso.<p>Coffee varies but generally speaking if one goes by the &quot;serving size&quot; on an energy drink it&#x27;s typically on par with coffee: \n<a href=""http://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/ip9ia/ive_been_warned_by_various_people_that_energy/c25k08j"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/ip9ia/ive_been_w...</a>",1414544148

Both the economics and the performance. And when it comes to processors design that has to respect many physical limits (wire delay, transistor behavior, ..) tuning process knobs will gain you much more than tuning architectural knobs. I think in the end process technology wins this fight.<p>The reason we haven&#x27;t seen competitive Intel products is that they just haven&#x27;t cared about power for like ever. Their company is built for speed. Their income is from performance sensitive markets. All these power sensitive markets were pretty new and until recently -- pretty inconsequential in terms of revenue. Their process is not tuned for this. But I guess now that all these power sensitive users are starting to want more performance maybe Intel can rely on some of its strengths.<p>When you have a massive company like Intel it takes time to change directions. I honestly think by the time Broadwell or Skylake comes out you will start to see Intel power-competitive in the low performance segments.",1414544125

8524821,comment,8523421,8523853,0,0,millstone,,,"> Ideally, a computer keyboard would be able to directly send both an arbitrary number of named control functions, and arbitrary unicode text (either as full strings or as code units one by one)<p>You&#x27;re right about how the input stack is tangled up, but wrong about the ideal state. The keyboard is absolutely not the right place for this sort of intelligence.<p>No keyboard has 100k+ keys, so Unicode input is fundamentally a UI problem. Look at the enormous number of Chinese input methods, all of which need to cooperate closely with the GUI to work. Or heck, how do you type é? On OS X, you can either press option-e followed by e, or press and hold e, and select from a popup menu. These both require integration with the OS and GUI, and cannot be handled by the keyboard itself.<p>Even setting aside Unicode input, we still often need to know which keys were pressed. I&#x27;m programming a FPS game - what happens when the user presses the 2 key? If it&#x27;s on the number row, it should select weapon #2; but if it&#x27;s on the numpad, it should move the character backwards. So it&#x27;s not enough to know the key&#x27;s character; I need to know which physical key was pressed!<p>The layered approach you describe is confusing and error-prone, but it&#x27;s necessary, because software needs to act at different levels. Some software wants very high-level Unicode text input, while others need to know very fine-grained keyboard layout details. All of the data must be bubbled up through all layers.",1414544108

Smartphones and mobile devices have enabled people&#x27;s <i>lives</i> to be much easier. Not more than 10 minutes ago I just determined the optimal route to a meeting, factoring in real-time traffic (measured by phones) and overlapping mass transit lines. If I&#x27;m late or my meeting partner isn&#x27;t there (&quot;there&quot; being a location determined by ratings on Yelp&#x27;s app, as the meeting was scheduled via my phone during another meeting), I have instant access to him and vice versa. Just the first example that comes to mind.<p>There are, literally, dozens of expensive devices that have been replaced by free/inexpensive smartphone apps in the past few years, to say nothing of smartphones enabling us to do things we never even thought of a few years ago. In 2014, it is possible for the middle class to take timelapse aerial video from a drone and edit/upload/share it remotely via phone in a matter of minutes. I cannot imagine what will be possible in a mere two years, when apps have replaced even more expensive things and enabled us to do things heretofore unconsidered.",1414543531

8524727,comment,8520142,8522662,0,0,rayiner,,,"Taibbi&#x27;s use of facts leaves much to be desired. In writing a book, he has the luxury to weave together strands from different sources, leaving it to the reader to make all sorts of inferences. A prosecutor, however, is restricted by an evidentiary framework that allows certain facts to only be proved by certain sources, and allows juries to make only certain inferences.<p>Here&#x27;s a pretty neutral take on the facts: <a href=""http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/12/11/us-hsbc-probe-idUS..."" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/12/11/us-hsbc-probe-idUS...</a>.<p>This stuff makes for good reading, but let&#x27;s break it down through a legal lens. There is nothing illegal about your banking services being used to deposit the proceeds of illegal activity. It almost certainly happens all the time to every bank. In fact, no bank executive could say with a straight face that they don&#x27;t have a generalized knowledge that their services are used for money laundering. What differentiates legal from illegal conduct, on the part of the bank, is nothing more than what the bank knew about the nature of the money deposited in specific transactions: <a href=""http://www.swlaw.com/assets/pdf/news/2011/09/26/MoneyLaundering_Denney.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.swlaw.com/assets/pdf/news/2011/09/26/MoneyLaunder...</a>. The crime requires the government to prove that the defendant had knowledge that the deposits were proceeds of illegal activity.<p>Viewed through this lens, the facts are much less compelling:<p>> Despite the known risks of doing business in Mexico, the bank put the country in its lowest risk category<p>The mens rea is knowledge, not negligence. To be relevant here, the &quot;known risks&quot; would have to be so blatant that ignoring them would amount to willful ignorance of specific illegal deposits.<p>> which excluded $670 billion in transactions from the monitoring systems, according to the documents.<p>This might provide a motive for the alleged crime, but it&#x27;s much stronger in a case for negligence than in a case for money laundering. Moreover, HSBC&#x27;s selection of controls probably excludes trillions of dollars of transactions in places like the U.S. or Canada. This fact by itself doesn&#x27;t tell you anything other than that the bank has an incentive to implement as few expensive controls as it can get away with.<p>> Bank officials repeatedly ignored internal warnings that HSBC&#x27;s monitoring systems were inadequate, the Justice Department said.<p>First, &quot;repeatedly ignored&quot; is a characterization, not a fact. Second, HSBC was not legally required to implement this particular controls. Third, for this fact to be relevant, the warnings would have to make the problem so apparent that ignoring them amounted to willful blindness to specific illegal activity.<p>> In 2008, for example, the CEO of HSBC Mexico was told that Mexican law enforcement had a recording of a Mexican drug lord saying that HSBC Mexico was the place to launder money.<p>This sounds really compelling, but it&#x27;s really not very strong legally. First, you have evidentiary issues. An anecdote about a recording of a comment by a Mexican drug lord isn&#x27;t going to get admitted as evidence that drug traffickers actually used HSBC to launder money. It&#x27;s hearsay. Second, it doesn&#x27;t refer to specific deposits of illegal proceeds, nor is it so compelling as to prove that failure to act on this knowledge amounts to willful ignorance as to specific illegal deposits. Third, you have to prove that the parent company knew anything about all of this.<p>> Mexican traffickers used boxes specifically designed to the dimensions of an HSBC Mexico teller&#x27;s window to deposit cash on a daily basis.<p>This is legally irrelevant unless you can prove that: 1) anyone who mattered at HSBC actually knew what shape these boxes were and why; 2) that failure to act in light of this knowledge amounted to willful blindness as to specific illegal deposits.<p>> At times, only one to four employees were responsible for reviewing alerts identifying suspicious wire transactions. When HSBC processed bulk cash, a business it calls Banknotes, only one or two compliance officials oversaw transactions for 500 to 600 customers, the Justice Department said.<p>This is again more relevant to a negligence claim than a money laundering charge. Does this evidence go to prove that HSBC had knowledge of specific illegal transactions?<p>The &quot;drug trafficker&#x27;s boxes&quot; fact is a great example of the difference between a narrative in a book and an actual prosecution. Taibbi can state it as a fact and let the reader draw all sorts of conclusions. But as a prosecutor, you must:\n1) Find someone with personal knowledge of the shape of the boxes; this guy is likely a drug trafficker and thus not a very sympathetic witness;<p>2) Find someone with personal knowledge who can testify that HSBC had actual knowledge of the boxes and appreciated the significance of the shape;<p>3) Justify taking HSBC&#x27;s knowledge of the shape of the boxes + HSBC&#x27;s knowledge of the widespread nature of their use, and from that inferring that HSBC knew specific deposits were the proceeds of illegal activity.",1414542848

But now that we have scaled up and have all the teams in place, &quot;too much money&quot; is probably even a 1 percent premium.  In other words, if we moved to a commercial solution now it would be because we actually SAVE money over using our own pods.  That shouldn&#x27;t be impossible - a commercial operation could make their profit margin out of a variety of savings, like maybe their drives fail less often than ours do because they do better vibration dampening.  Or since this is &quot;end-to-end cost of ownership&quot; if the commercial system could save half of our electricity bill by being lower power then they can keep 100 percent of that.<p>We have a simple spreadsheet that calculates the cost of space rental for datacenter cabinets, the electricity pods use, the networking they use, the cost of all the switches, etc.  It isn&#x27;t overwhelmingly complex or anything.  It includes the cost of salaries of datacenter techs with a formula that says stuff like &quot;for every 400 pods we hire one more datacenter tech&quot;, stuff like that.\nHopefully if we went to a commercial built storage system we could increase the ratio like only hire one more datacenter tech every 800 pods.

We&#x27;ve reached the same point we did with laptops a few years ago where making hardware more powerful doesn&#x27;t improve the user experience much.

For x86, ebp (rbp in 64 bit mode) is used for this purpose, and a stack frame looks something like this:<p><pre><code>  var_2 at [ebp-8] <-- top of stack, lowest address (yes this is counter-intuitive)\n  var_1 at [ebp-4]\n  return_address [ebp] <-- ebp points here\n  arg_1 at [ebp+4]\n  arg_2 at [ebp+8]\n</code></pre>\nNo matter how much data you push onto the stack in local variables (even variable length structures eg with alloca or variable length arrays in C), the parameters are always accessible at positive offsets from ebp while the (fixed-size) local variables are at negative offsets.<p>Without a frame pointer, parameters must be accessed relative to the stack pointer instead. Disadvantages of this include:<p>Both parameters and local variables are at positive offsets in comparison to esp, so it&#x27;s harder to tell the two apart.<p>The offsets can change throughout the function as variables are pushed and sometimes popped from the stack, making analysis even more difficult.<p>You can&#x27;t allocate variable width structures on the stack because then the compiler would not know at what offsets the parameters/variables would lie.<p>And it&#x27;s not even necessarily a performance win either, because x86 uses longer instruction encodings for sp-relative addressing vs. bp-relative addressing.<p>x86_64 and most RISC architectures don&#x27;t have this problem, there are enough spare registers that the negatives of -fomit-frame-pointer outweigh the positives.",1414541145

I read at some point recently farmers have moved to crops such as pistachio nuts which have high margins, but take something like 1 gallon of water per nut.<p>And water usage in rich areas actually increased year-over-year, which is infuriating.  We had rain throughout the winter, and even a couple of summer showers recently which is rare, and if you look at Crystal Springs reservoir, the water levels don&#x27;t look as bad as some of the pictures you see on the news.<p>So I think this is more a case of demand vs supply.  What hasn&#x27;t increased however, is our water rates.  Places in Hillsborough, a rich area of SV, use in excess of 300 gallons per day to water their lawns, vs other areas.  I personally have stopped watering my lawn down to zero, and my property is a big patch of dirt now.  I think there should be a tax on people who want to water their lawn during these times, because it&#x27;s so unimportant.  For a household of 2 adults and 2 kids, we use less than 85 gallons per day, and my water bill is $15/month.",1414541002

Yes the growth of mobile is explosive and, in some cases, it&#x27;s displacing older technology. But for a lot of use cases small touch screen devices are simply inadequate. It&#x27;s probably true that a lot of people that used to use desktop or laptop computers just to check email and Facebook have shifted that activity to their phones and tablets. But its equally true that these devices are still really only good for quick, informal communication and browsing. Despite the best efforts of Apple and Samsung to persuade us otherwise, tablets are lousy for getting real work done.<p>So we find ourselves in the ironic situation of a domain that is experiencing almost unprecedented growth but in which almost nobody is making money except Facebook and the vendors of what are essentially gimmicky slot machine games. My take on this is that the market for richer desktop/laptop software isn&#x27;t going anywhere soon. People that need to edit complex spreadsheets, compose scores for films, analyze genomes, and render 3d effects need real computers.

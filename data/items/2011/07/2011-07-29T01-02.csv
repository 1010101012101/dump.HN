2819844,comment,2817090,2819767,2,0,timsally,,,"> Where do you draw the line on pharmaceutical marketing?<p>The line is pretty straightforward. No marketing to patients of any drug that requires a prescription whatsoever. The reason why these medicines require prescriptions is because they are more serious than aspirin or sunscreen, so it's an easy and reasonable line to draw. Marketing to doctors is fine (i.e. the market actors who have the base knowledge necessary to make reasonably informed decisions). There are plenty of policy arguments to be found on why direct marketing of pharmaceuticals is not a net win. There's a reason why it only happens in the United States and New Zealand.<p>> If you are seriously worried about a highly educated segment of society being misled by a simple numerical trick like the one you describe, there must be no hope whatsoever for humanity if the only people we can trust to watch commercials are people with a Ph.D in stats.<p>The same arguments were made about predatory lending agreements and similarly misleading financial mechanisms. Society has come down in large part against these things, rejecting the idea that the consumer is wholly responsible to educate themselves. Marketing with law schools is a serious problem and the ABA is currently under investigation by several senators on this issue.<p>> If someone has not become well acquainted with the sorts of semi-misleading things mentioned in ads by the time he/she is an adult, something is seriously wrong, and the sort of paternalistic society needed to protect this person from him/herself is unacceptably oppressive to everyone else's freedom.<p>Sounds great on paper, but like most arguments of this type it doesn't hold up. In reality you've got people with average college educations going up against PhDs in finance, economics, psychology, etc. Companies can afford to pay these people huge salaries in order to increase sales, while the consumers are just regular people who get home after a hard days work and don't want to spend the balance of their free time on figuring out how the business execs are trying to trip them up.  The bottom line is that in this country and others companies don't have the absolute freedom to represent their product how they want. As a practical consideration consumers don't have the time to educate themselves to the proper level and so regulation stops companies from taking advantage of consumers.<p>The argument that typically comes back is nanny state, etc, etc, etc. But I find it telling that it is only the people with the ability and education to combat predatory practices that make this argument. In reality America is composed of a diverse set of people, some with education, some without, some native speakers, some not. Some regulation to protect everyone who otherwise would trample the average citizen because of greed is the right thing to do.",1311904594

2819840,comment,2818349,2819620,2,0,scott_s,,,"What I meant was, ""it's fixed <i>somehow</i>"". I assume the original reasoning for why code is copyrightable is that when I write, say, a book, that is copyrightable. Code is written down just like a book is, so it follows that copyright will apply. I'm not saying that's the legal reasoning. I'm saying that was probably the initial gut-reaction to why copyright should apply to code, and the legal reasoning came afterwards.<p>I have spent time with the various forms of IP, and I feel I have a pretty good grasp of what copyright is. I can't correct any misconceptions unless you point them out - although I have a feeling it's more that I did a poor job of expressing myself.<p>Attempt the second: with non-software inventions, you can have a copyright on the documents that explain how to build the invention. You can have a patent on the invention itself. Software can be both copyrighted and patented. You object to this because it's the only instance we have of something that can be both copyrighted and patented - it's a unique exception. I responded to this objection by pointing out that software is also unique in that what you use to describe exactly how to make the invention is the invention itself.",1311904484

2819836,comment,2818517,2819246,1,0,wes-exp,,,"Limiting software patents only to ""non-obvious"" ones sounds good in theory, but I suspect it breaks down in practice. Most software patents are written up in ""mumbo jumbo"" language, to use the term from the recent piece on This American Life. If you're a patent examiner, working under a backlog, and every day trying to wrap your head around obfuscated nonsense that doesn't even make sense to the original ""inventors"", are you really going to do complete diligence to determine obviousness? For that matter, is it even possible to determine?<p>I think it would be simpler just to eliminate software patents entirely. You can cherry-pick maybe one or two examples of <i>possibly</i> beneficial software patents (e.g. public key encryption as you mention), but for the most part software patents have been economically destructive. And further, even stuff like RSA would most likely get created without patents anyway, because that stuff tends to come out of academia where many researchers would be happy just to have some influential papers. I doubt profit motive is really even a significant factor.",1311904353

Yet very, very few cancers have been cured by targeted drug therapy, and even if a drug helps a patient survive six or nine more months, cancer cells often find a way around it.</i><p>I'm not really liking a lot of what the article says but I liked the above quote.  Personally, I tend to think most cancers probably have a viral origin.  Virii, like the ones that cause warts or cold sores, are well known to insert themselves into cells and thereby create ""growths"".  Off the top of my head, I don't know of anything else which is known to do something similar.  And we know human papilloma virus plays a role in cervical cancer (which is why so many women get annual pap smears).",1311903540

If the function returns nil or false, then assert raises an error, and the error message is used as the error in the assert. For example:<p><pre><code>  > = assert(io.open(""hello""))

The argument is whether the software alone should be patentable.<p>The software by itself is NOT a timer.  The timer's software is only the idea of the timer; it is the instructions, the observation of which allow the physical timer to function.  There must still be a physical timer -- an assembly of physical parts that follows programmed instructions to provide a function.  That entire assembly is what should be patented.<p>The bare idea of the timer -- the steps that the timer takes while it's working, should not be patentable.  That's what the article is proposing.

Let me go back to the actual issues here as I see them.<p>You seem to be arguing that writing software is basically a creative process which is the same as producing literature and music but software is fundamentally different in that it  goes beyond aesthetics. Software is not normally used to produce an expression / statement about life / culture or someone's emotional state etc but is used to process data in such a way as to have a functional and measureable impact.<p>Here's a question for you.  Your competitor has patented a ""solution"" which basically the same as yours and is now sueing you for infringement how would copyright and / or trade secrets help?""?<p>Here's another question. Why is a software patent special? As opposed to one based on expression of a solution to a problem in terms of, say, electronic circuitry?<p>Let's say that your wish is granted and software patents are made illegally but hardware patents are still legal how would we stop companies like Apple and HTC ""gaming"" the system by tying the software to physical devices so that they become hardware patents?<p>I'm not sure I have all the answers but making software patents a special case just feels wrong and is likely to have so many legal loopholes as to be worthless ?<p>The patent system as currently practiced is broken. That much is clear.  It was supposed to be about promoting innovation and the spread of knowledge. Instead it seems to really be about granting monopolies. But until the law is changed companies have to apply for patents if only to protect themselves against attack.<p>We need fundamental changes to the patent system which applies to ALL patents.",1311901269

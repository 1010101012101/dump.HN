It allows for even more expressive code. Instead of tests, you write your types, and your program is an executable proof that your type holds. Quite mind-boggling, and very awesome. Of course, these languages are currently only suited for academic use, but I suspect they will inspire other languages.",1289408379

Of course, JavaScript is going to be in almost any job posting that's web-related, even if it's not true hardcore JS coding. Perl is used heavily for development automation, so it's also going to have a big showing, even if it isn't the core language. You'll also tend to see lines like ""Previous scripting experience with Perl, Python, Ruby a plus"" for Java postings.<p>If it could be monetized, doing more sophisticated data mining into job postings for actual popularity trends would be awesome, especially with a decent granularity. It wouldn't be difficult to train a supervised ML algorithm with a set of keyword-tagged job postings with weights as to how significant a certain set of skills would be used at a job for a certain job posting.",1289408311

1890956,comment,1889720,1890599,0,0,jamii,,,"> How did you train your search engine?<p>I used some pretty simple techniques: one bayesian filter to filter jobs from other posts in mailing lists etc, one bayesian filter to score jobs based on keywords. Both filters were trained by feedback from the console ui. The main problem is excluding site-specific keywords that distort the scoring (eg if a site with mostly crappy jobs includes its own name in the listing then even the good jobs will score low by association). A lot of job sites have manky markup so I also had a different scraping script for each site to extract text. All in all its only a couple of hours work. I've been thinking recently about extending it  and adding a simple web ui, since finding freelance work is pretty time consuming.<p>> What sort of collaborative filtering techniques?<p>I didn't have any specific in mind but there are plenty of good machine learning books that cover different tecniques. If you don't already have a background in maths then 'Programming Collective Intelligence' is a good book to start with. 'The Elements of Statistical Learning' goes into a lot more detail but requires some basic maths.<p>> Would love to chat further via email.<p>Email is in my profile.",1289408144

Later on, she'd bat at the pages, trying to imitate our page-turning. The only difference between a book and a chew-toy was that we'd compliment her on reading and point out when we were reading too.<p>If you don't think you'd want to make a big deal about reading to your child, then don't fake it.

We would point out colours of shapes, and praise our daughter when she got the colour right. Now colours are extremely significant. I.e. every object must be described as (colour, name). I wonder what the result would have been if we'd started with some other property.<p>She also <i>has</i> to have us roll up her pants when wearing boots, because <i>once</i> we mentioned that she should roll up her pants so she wouldn't trip.

Most mainstream programming languages are still in their infancy, being nothing more than glorified assembly.<p>The future will be more about declarative programming - write down a mental model of the program, and the language/compiler will do the rest. A simple restricted example is SQL - you write what data you want and the optimizer figures out the best ""program"" for the query, using even genetic optimization in the case of PostgreSQL.
Another example is data binding - you write down what data connects to what part of the GUI, and the framework figures out what to update and when.
The problem with SQL, data binding etc. is that they are not tightly integrated into a general purpose language, and do not have clear theoretical underpinnings.<p>A good language will have simple, compact theories and abstractions as general as possible to reduce the mental baggage necessary for programming - instead of remembering hunders of special cases, you should only work with a couple of general constructs.<p>Optimizers for these languages will have to be far more advanced - remember state between compilations to reduce the impact of whole program optimization, have advanced specialization and type checking capabilities using abstract interpretation etc.<p>Data models will have to grow too - they will have to be high-level and low-level at the same time to cope with the onslaught of data. The semantic web provides a fairly universal data model with RDF/OWL, but this again could be simplified and abstracted. A data model should also have the capability to specify the physical layout of the data down to the bits, but also at the higher level, such as distribution between disks and machines.

I think anyone that has experienced the full life cycle of an enterprise level web app can relate to this article.<p>The good news for the author is it gets better. The bad news is this takes time, a lot of time.<p>Disclaimer: It was a long article, so I skimmed it instead of reading in its entirety, but here is some general advice none the less.<p>Advice (from a front end guy):<p>1) Stick to what you know, and sprinkle in new stuff as you go. (Just get something working)<p>* If your a backend programmer, go balls out on this part of the app.  For the front end, keep the code entry level.  Use tables, embedded CSS, and case specific JavaScript (for example a jQuery light box) when needed.<p>2) Start using jQuery or MooTools pronto (solves that pesky browser compatibility issue)<p>* If you haven't started this yet, do so as soon as possible.  Don't worry about creating an entire JS framework until you are very comfortable with jQuery or MooTools.  This will save you many hours of bug fixes on code that you are going to have to rewrite anyways.<p>* I prefer MooTools because of the way the code is structured.  They have a function called Class() which gives you the ability to Extend or Implement (to a certain degree) other MooTools classes that you create.<p>3) CSS oh no, I feel bad for you.<p>* CSS is a complete shit show when you are just starting out.  Keep it entry level with fonts, colors, images, backgrounds, borders.  If you get stuck, solve it with JS or embedded styles and fix it later when you have a better understanding of CSS.<p>* Also, avoid padding where possible and stick to using margins.  This will save you box model complications.<p>4) CSS floats warning, if you must<p>* If you end up using floats, don't forget your lil buddy, the div.clear hack.  This kind of works like a line break.<p>* div.clear {
  clear: both;
}<p>* <div class=""floatLeft"">stuff</div>
<div class=""floatLeft"">more stuff</div>
<div class=""clear""></div>    <-- (I know it feels dirty introducing a seemingly unnecessary element to the DOM, but hey, it WORKS!!)<p>5) Be ready for a long UI/UX journey<p>* It takes time to get cozy with this stuff, but when you do you will feel like a geeky rock star.  It is a lot of fun when you get to the more advanced UI/UX stuff.  Enjoy every little UI/UX mile stone along the way, they are fun.  You will feel like you are programming at a turtle's pace, but a few months from now you will look back and think ""Look at all the cool stuff I can do!""<p>6) Good Luck!",1289405335

You don't hold it in your hand or religiously carry it in your bag. You don't rely on it for communicating with people. It doesn't give you access to any new information or ideas. You interact with it for maybe a few minutes a day. You can't create new things with it. The admiration for personal technology is a lot closer to the reverence musicians hold for particular brands/models of instruments which is based on their build quality, their unique sound, their design, and many other intangible details.<p>The connection people might feel to Jobs is probably based on the simple human experience of relating to people with similar ideas/views or the relationship people have with someone who influences their own way of thinking. I feel a deep personal connection with most of my favorite authors and musicians though I've never met most of them. You could easily marginalize them as people who have accomplished little more than putting words on paper or sound waves on tape but I would not agree with that at all because of the experiences I've had with their words & sounds.",1314309558

2926597,comment,2925609,2926579,3,0,Yoric,,,"There are common points. However, Opa goes much further than Gwt (and its toolchain supersets) in terms of automation, concurrency, distribution and security.<p>Automation: by default, you do not have to give the compiler any hint as to whether code should be compiled towards the client, the server, the database, etc. The compiler solves all of this automatically, inserting whichever Ajax/Comet calls wherever needed. You can, however, provide annotations for optimization and/or security purposes.<p>Concurrency/distribution: at its heart, Opa is based on an actor model (although you do not need to use actors for simple applications). This actor model lets you connect easily clients, servers, etc. or subsystems through a very simple paradigm.<p>Security: every Ajax/Comet call inserted is checked for a number of criteria. In particular, the structure of messages is checked automatically, entry points generated dynamically for one single client can only be used by that client, etc.<p>Note: I'm one of the authors of Opa.",1314309458

2926591,comment,2926432,2926432,1,0,dredmorbius,,,"As a kid, studying science, I found myself frequently frustrated by the topical and, I felt, irrelevant inclusion of biographical details of various scientists in discussions of physics, chemistry, biology, and mathematics.<p>To my young mind, the scientific facts were independent of <i>who</i> discovered them, and this was an unnecessary distraction.  ""Just the facts, ma'am"" would have been my preference.<p>In my dotage, my view has changed.<p>First: each of these scientific facts was discovered by a person, or more usually, teams of people, sometimes working together at one place and one time, but often at a remove in both dimensions. It's a social process. It took a long time for me to realize that these weren't simply dry words on a page or facts in a class.<p>Second: each individual's insights often grew from experiences and thought processes specific to them. Understanding the circumstances helps understand (and sometimes explain) the insights (it also occasionally provides clues as to weaknesses of the conclusions as well).<p>Third: we're social animals and remember things in a social context. Once the _dramatis personae_ do become established in our minds, it adds another layer of interconnectivity for recall of facts.<p>Fourth: as I came to interact with the world as an adult and met people I'd read about (or read about people I'd met), I came to appreciate that these weren't some two-dimensional cartoons or gods, but real people, much like myself, and knowing and understanding them could help me not only understand their work but to further it myself. It's the rare week now that I don't see something in my news feed that doesn't have a direct personal connection.<p>So: while I'm certainly not a fan of all things Steve and Apple (though I make very heavy use of his NeXT interface, in fact, as I type these words), I recognize that he, as a man, with his background and inspirations, created Apple, and drove it through two distinct periods of phenomenal growth and development.  If he copied, he copied from the best, and improved in the copying (usually).  He has a clarity of vision and a view of the ideal to which any physical and technological instantiation is at best an approximation, but repeatedly he's blown all existing models out of the water, and created whole new paths of development and advancement.<p>For this I can indeed bow to the man.",1314309325

(i) you need a proper keyboard, (ii) you need a proper dev environment, and (iii) interpreters are forbidden and you are not root anyway.<p>Try to do <i>anything</i> on the iPad.  You need an App.  And since you can't write one yourself (at least not on the iPad), you have do download one that passes through Apples moral filter (no sex but war is okay, so much for ""peace and love"").<p>It's not like you <i>can't</i> create with the iPad.  But the thing is not a general purpose computer to begin with.  It wasn't meant that way.  Apple optimized ease of consumption, and for that they sacrificed everything that got in the way, including creation.<p>I'll slightly amend my phrasing: for production, <i>compared to a general purpose computer</i>, the iPad is worth next to naught.  And Apple likely doesn't care, though it would be bad PR to admit it.<p>Now if Apple suddenly gave you the root password, that would be another story. My argument would be limited to the form factor, which isn't such a big issue (just put your iPad on a docking station).",1314309261

Overall, if money is the goal, get a job as a waiter; it will probably pay better.<p>OTOH if your book is among the first on a topic of current interest and doesn't suck you can do alright.<p>It can be a lot of work.  For the VB book I needed to spend some time researching some W3C specs and making sure I had some technical details correct, but much of what else I wrote came from an application I had already written, so it was fairly easy to write about.   For better or worse it gave me a falsely rosy picture of book writing. :)<p>The Ruby book, though, ended up being more work than I expected; documenting a language's behavior is more detailed than describing an app in that language. (Sadly, many language tech books suck because the authors don't actually know how the language works and fall back on loose, often incorrect, assumptions and analogies.)<p>A book can help build a reputation, get you speaking gigs, and in assorted ways contribute indirectly to income, so book sales alone may not tell the whole story.  But it's pretty unpredictable.  Books get canceled; hot topics fade away.  Maybe you or a coauthor really cannot write.<p>If you're not innately excited about the idea, or don't feel confident in your tech writing skills,  you might do well to hold off.  Maybe write some blog posts, gauge reader interest, and test market the idea of a book.",1314309198

I am not a member of the core dev team for this language, and have not contributed to the standard library. However, I feel like at some point you have to give yourself some credit and say ""yes, I do have the expertise to advise other people on this topic"".<p>I know we have quite a few published authors floating around on HN who will have experience in this situation, and i'm sure would have faced something similar when writing their first book. When did you feel comfortable putting your experience on a page? When did you feel confident that your experience would be valuable to other people?<p>At this stage i'm looking to turn down the offer because I don't think I can honestly say that I am an authority on the topic for the proposed book. The way I see it, someone who is writing a book should be an active member of the community at the very least, but i'm more of a lurker. Aside from being active they should also have some recognition within the community, which generally comes with activity and contribution to such a community. For me, the other edge of this sword is that people often become authorities by publishing a well-written pieces of literature that the community feels are valuable.<p>Is there some critical balance between having valuable experience/knowledge, and simply believing in yourself enough to take up an opportunity like this?",1314307441

2926457,comment,2925609,2926322,4,0,hbbio,,,"Fully agreed that current web programming is complex and that was the driving force behind making Opa.
What might not be clear in the presentation of Opa is that it's not some new glue on top of existing components.
It's instead a whole new, clean, technology for writing and running web applications.<p>And given that the language is statically typed (with inference in most cases, so it's easy for the programmer) with first-class web values, the whole point of Opa is that the compiler knows quite a lot about your application when generating the binaries. The typing system determines wether part of the code will run on the client side, on the server side (or both) for instance. This mechanism is very different from Ruby on Rails for instance, although both approaches share the goal of making the programmer's life easy.<p>Building RESTful services is exactly where Opa excels. Have a look at <a href=""http://doc.opalang.org/index.html#_hello_web_services"" rel=""nofollow"">http://doc.opalang.org/index.html#_hello_web_services</a> and the following chapter.",1314306815

Took a CS Introduction to Functional Programming course at university, taught using Clean, a pure and lazy functional language developed at the university. Most of their research currently is related to iTasks (see <a href=""http://wiki.clean.cs.ru.nl/ITasks"" rel=""nofollow"">http://wiki.clean.cs.ru.nl/ITasks</a>) which also does web apps, but focused on workflows. As a web dev however, it totally stripped the layers between model and browser, which is actually the harder part most of the time where the customization happens, and became this (all too simple) mess of models and functions. It was too early stage software too, various server bugs in the built-in HTTP server, and lacking JS/frontend implemantation. Only one of the 15 weeks needed iTasks, which was a good thing, for students and TA sanity.",1314306601
2926447,comment,2926314,2926314,1,0,byoung2,,,"This is like the software side of an idea I had maybe a decade ago.  My idea would be to modify workout machines with sensors.  Think of those Nautilus type pulley machines.  You would swipe your card (magstripe, RFID, barcode, etc) when you sit down (start time recorded).  Then you select the weight you want to lift (weight setting recorded).  As you lift, various sensors would record the time per rep, range of motion, speed, etc.  The idea would be that you don't have to waste time writing in a log, and the computer could capture data that you couldn't (like the fact that your last 4 reps only had 85% extension, vs your first 2 which had 98%).  With sensors on all the machines in a typical gym (weight machines, treadmills, elliptical, etc.), you could get a full picture of how your workout went.  Plus you could see how you progress over time. The challenge would be to get a big gym to allow you to wire up all of their machines, or work with a manufacturer to get them to include these sensors.",1314306587

(Of course, I'm only talking about functions from values to values here, not about functions from types to types and so on.)<p>Whether bob is a function or not will of course depend on its type. For instance, consider the following definition for f:<p><pre><code>    f = (+ 5)
</code></pre>
Then yes, bob will be a function, with type Num a => a -> a. On the other hand, if you decide to define f as<p><pre><code>    f = take (10^10) $ [1..]
</code></pre>
then it won't. The distinction here is determined entirely at compile time: it's about what type a particular value has.<p>> Therefore, ""f = sum [1,2,3,4,5,6]"" and ""f = 21"" are completely conceptually equal.<p>Right. They're both values of some concrete integer type.",1314306326

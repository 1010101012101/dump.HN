217106,comment,216846,217066,0,0,abl,,,"I believe MSFT improved upon this since - you can call stored procs through an ObjectDataSource.  So, as long as you have your tiers set up right, you could just rely on CRUD in the db back-end.<p>You know, maybe they are using mono for .NET on Amazon..which is not the road I want to take - too much setup, maintenance, and uncertainty.<p>The shared hosting comes with a drawback - most of these shared hosts are black or white - either all linux or all windows. If I want to run php scripts, or a C++ process, I am stuck - unless I go with a VPS or dedicated, which brings up the cost to $50+, at which point one might as well go with Mosso or EC2..<p>Btw, if anyone wants to split Mosso with me, please PM me.",1213386926

Maybe easier said than done though....<p>With Google Sites for example, users are clamoring for features, in fact there seems to be a consensus on which lacking features are most important, yet no word or ETA's from Google.. I got a response back regarding the premium edition of Google Sites, seems like the only premium feature available now is that each user gets extra 500MB disk space..

So these microscopic worlds each change when a quantum event occurs?  If they can change, then why not think that there's only one world, which changes when you measure something?  It's a lot simpler and seems to handle everything that this theory does.  Of course, if they don't change, then we're in a microscopic world with a precise configuration at any given moment, and every observable has a value, and Einstein was right, and we wouldn't observe Bell's inequalities.  But we do, and anyway, the whole reason we postulate this stuff is because we think that things <i>in our world</i> (you know, the one I'm sitting in, microscopic or otherwise) actually evolve according to the wave function.<p>BTW, if your picture is Bohmian mechanics, then you only need one world, where every particle has a well-defined position all the time, and these evolve according to the wave function.  These different possible histories are epistemically possible because we don't know what region of the wave function the particle currently inhabits.  But that's not a continuous infinity of worlds, microscopic or otherwise, unless you're just using the word ""world"" that way.",1213386353

For me, the most valuable thing was learning that this was an actual field with a name, which gave me a starting point for self-study.<p>Also check out <i>Computational Geometry in C</i>, Second Ed., by O'Rourke.

Especially if you're good. ""John Smith the ruby/python/design expert"" is a perfectly legitimate way to be known. It's easier than ""Smith Software, the small expert ruby/python/design house"", IMO.<p>I know 10-20 independent programmers and designers in my area, and in every single case, I think of them by their personal names. I'm sure they all have some LLC name, but in most cases, I don't know what it is. Even if they put it on their business card, I'm more likely to refer them to someone as an individual (""I know this good designer - Mick Jones - you should talk to him"") rather than by a company name (""I know this good design shop - Compelling Solutions - you should check them out."")<p>I think this changes when you grow beyond 2 full-time folks.

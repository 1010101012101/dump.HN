10765425,comment,10763151,10763151,0,0,jcrawfordor,,,"I wonder about the applicability of this status code to &#x27;friendly&#x27; blocking. In my workplace, as in many others, we have a web proxy that blocks certain requests for security or policy reasons. I would like it if the vendor implemented something like this for its capture page, as it&#x27;d make it easier to identify where requests are blocked and why in various logs. In particular, user-agents could tell the user when a request is blocked for this reason, which would be more robust than the HTML message it returns and would make help-desk operations a lot easier - &quot;this thing doesn&#x27;t work and I get a browser notice about blocking,&quot; instead of &quot;this thing doesn&#x27;t work&quot; and then having to dig through logs.<p>Just a thought about applications for this beyond the obvious (but less common in the US) state censorship - it can be seen as a technical help for making sure security and policy controls are clearly communicated to machines as well as people, which makes it easier to figure out when those controls are overbroad.",1450569431

I wasn&#x27;t alone in getting drawn in by the research papers.<p>I went to Sun and learned how a kernel could work and could perform and the allure of Mach, for me, started to wane.  Reading the mach code made it worse, especially compared to the Sun code.<p>All these years later, I remain underwhelmed.  Linux has a nicer VM system, performs better, and is more readable.  Not Sun level readable by any stretch, but better than my memory of mach (which, to be fair, is in the distant past).<p>If someone can point to actual real world data that shows Mach to be better performing on the same hardware I&#x27;d be interested in seeing that, I tend to think that&#x27;s not possible.<p>If you want to see what a real microkernel done right looks like, go look at QNX before they added the POSIX conformance.  You have 4-5 people logged into an 80286 doing work.  Very, very light weight and well done.  They were the only guys that understood what the &quot;micro&quot; in microkernel meant.  I remember Dan Hildebrandt telling me that the microkernel easily fit in a 4K instruction cache (it pretty much had to, it didn&#x27;t do much so you needed some space for whatever it was dispatching).",1450569344

10765378,comment,10758888,10765155,0,0,brandonbloom,,,"Thinking in data & functions just takes some practice. Traditionally imperative code can often be reimagined in terms of reducing over a command sequence, or interpreting some more sophisticated representation. The benefits for implementation, testing, debugging, refactoring, etc can be massive.<p>Consider your chain of examples for &quot;Upload something to S3, if X then call some web service, otherwise log and call something else, etc etc etc.&quot; You could represent this as a sequence of steps which could be interpreted by a central side-effecting loop. Let&#x27;s call it an &quot;action plan&quot;, in this case for your &quot;upload&quot; operation:<p><pre><code>    (defn upload-plan [req]\n      [{:action :upload\n        :file (get-in req [:params :doc])\n        :max-size 2000\n        :name :doc}\n       {:action :notify\n        :message (fn [state] (get-in state [:data :doc]))\n        :target [:somebody]}])\n</code></pre>\nNow you can process this plan centrally:<p><pre><code>    (defmulti take-action (fn [state {:keys [action]}] action))\n\n    (defmethod take-action :upload ...)\n    (defmethod take-action :notify ...)\n\n    (defn execute [plan]\n      (let [{:keys [status]} (reduce take-action {:status :ok, :data {}} plan)]\n        (when (not= status :ok)\n          (log &quot;omg!&quot;))))\n</code></pre>\nWhile this is initially a tad more verbose, there&#x27;s great reasons to do this sort of thing.<p>For example, now have a central place to mock all side effects! You could substitute a different execute method during testing, or automatically log the &quot;action&quot; object that failed.<p>More importantly, you can develop each of your &quot;plan&quot; functions independently. You can reuse them, re-order them, etc.<p>You can also do hypotheticals, for example: &quot;Which plan would cause less network round trips?&quot; can be answered before committing to a plan.<p>You can _record_ plans. Instrument your execute method to record and save plans to a file, then you can just check them right in as test cases.<p>You can optimize plans. If five different functions all notify the same target of the same thing, your central execution method can filter subsequent calls. Or you could separate your &quot;optimization&quot; from your &quot;interpretation&quot; and you can ask &quot;After accounting for idempotence, which operations will be performed?&quot;<p>The list goes on and on...",1450568559

Quoting from <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trials_registry#Creation_and_development"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clinical_trials_registry#Creat...</a> :<p>> For many years, scientists and others have worried about reporting biases such that negative or null results from initiated clinical trials may be less likely to be published than positive results, thus skewing the literature and our understanding of how well interventions work.[2] This worry has been international and written about for over 50 years.[3] One of the proposals to address this potential bias was a comprehensive register of initiated clinical trials that would inform the public which trials had been started.[4] Ethical issues were those that seemed to interest the public most, as trialists (including those with potential commercial gain) benefited from those who enrolled in trials, but were not required to “give back,” telling the public what they had learned.<p>> Those who were particularly concerned by the double standard were systematic reviewers, those who summarize what is known from clinical trials. If the literature is skewed, then the results of a systematic review are also likely to be skewed, possibly favoring the test intervention when in fact the accumulated data do not show this, if all data were made public.<p>This is public information, and (quoting <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ClinicalTrials.gov"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ClinicalTrials.gov</a> ) &quot;A 2013 study analyzing 8907 interventional trials registered in ClinicalTrials.gov found that 23.2% of trials had abstract-linked result articles and 7.3% of trials had registry-linked articles. &quot;<p>To be truly anonymous would mean hiding this link, which would be a backwards step.",1450568357

You had single-server Unixes like Lites and OSF/1 (the latter sold commercially by DEC as Tru64 UNIX), plus multi-server systems like Mach-US, MASIX, MK++ (for high assurance) and GNU Hurd.<p>In the late 80s, the Open Software Foundation (OSF) was founded as a consortium of seven major tech companies spearheaded by DEC to standardize Unix in response to AT&T and Sun&#x27;s adoption of SVR4. They adopted Mach as part of this and ended up extending it to add locksets, semaphores and resource ledgers. MkLinux was then a joint effort in 1996 by Apple and the OSF to both have Linux on the PPC and exploit Mach features in the single-server emulation.<p>As such, the history is convoluted.

Even outside of that organization, more than a minute for a report is usually pretty much a non-starter.<p>The problems I&#x27;m referring to have nothing to do with a BI guy implementing complicated logic; this is just a part of the job description. Let me quote the section where it becomes clear that there&#x27;s a huge problem.<p>> The main database was IBM DB2 9.7 on RHEL and it had about 3 months (800GB) of data in it (we pruned it nightly). We had a &quot;reporting&quot; database that was postgres 9.3 or 9.4 (can&#x27;t remember). <i>It was the same schema</i> but was never pruned. It had about 15 billion rows total and about 5TB of data. About 700GB was indexes. The same query when ran on DB2 took 12 hours, on postgres (5x more data) it took 24 hours.<p>Emphasis is mine. They&#x27;re reporting on an OLTP schema. The reason that the query is many pages long, and that it takes 24 hours to run, is because the CTEs are being used as in-line ETL. Their &quot;reporting&quot; database is nothing of the sort, it&#x27;s just a replica of their operational system.<p>That poor BI guy is either out of his depth and doesn&#x27;t know how or is simply not allowed to build the appropriate solution.

The TLDR is that the olive oil business is equally pretentious and deceptive as other &quot;artisanal&quot; foods.<p>My wife an I attempted to start an olive oil company last year selling French extra virgin oil we make at our friend&#x27;s olive farm in Provence.. If you think the artisanal chocolate industry is full of deception and lies.. allow me to introduce to you the wonderful world of olive oil. Our production cost for 1 liter was almost double the retail cost of so-called high-end &quot;Italian&quot; extra virgin olive oil you&#x27;d buy at Whole Foods -- which basically means it is nearly impossible to source actual, 100% extra virgin olive oil at the prices they&#x27;re being sold for at the stores, there are some exceptions -- a few oils out there are actually the real deal. But a high percentage of grocery store oils aren&#x27;t what they claim to be (even at Whole Foods-type stores.)<p>Through a quirk of Italian law, oil that is bottled in Italy can be labeled &quot;100% Italian&quot; -- so there is a huge amount of inferior oils being passed off as both Italian and Extra Virgin and being priced accordingly, despite it being nearly impossible to wholesale Italian-grown, Italian made extra virgins at the price they&#x27;re selling it for. That&#x27;s even accounting for economies of scale.<p>My favorite label-scam is when I see &quot;First Cold Pressed.&quot; Absolutely zero oil you buy at grocery stores is ever cold pressed. Pressing actually creates inferior oils. Olive oils are extracted in large centrifuges. They haven&#x27;t been &quot;pressed&quot; in probably a generation, but &quot;First Cold Centrifuging&quot; doesn&#x27;t sound as &quot;artisanal.&quot; Producers know good and well they aren&#x27;t pressing anything, yet they (correctly) figure that that particular wording is going to attract a customer who imagines images of an old dude dumping fresh olives still moist with dew into a large, wooden handled press to squeeze out oil just for them. Basically your stereotypical hipster-type that wants to opine about the importance of &quot;hand&quot; crafting. I know probably a dozen olive oil producers here in Provence and every single one of them hand-craft their oils using state of the art, stainless steel equipment in spotless production facilities. Some of this facilities are located in a converted barn, but that idyllic image of the &quot;craftsman&quot; using &quot;traditional&quot; methods is just a myth. Though, playing off of those ignorant imaginings means that companies, using the right wording, can charge champagne prices for malt liquor.<p>I suppose if we just took Tunisia or Turkish oils, bottled them as French oils, put a ultra-premium price on it -- and grew some beards and distributed out of Brooklyn, we might have been more successful.<p>My point is that the artisanal and premium food business is rife with deception.

In the article their existence is taken as an accepted fact; it just talks about how to protect oneself from them.<p>You&#x27;ve reached a strange conclusion here. Mass shootings (and other types of mass killings) happpen. Taking responsibility for your personal safety is simply prudent. You, individually, can probably not prevent all or even one mass shooting from occuring (perhaps, if you are very lucky, you could stop ONE mass shooting in your lifetime). You can, however, make sure you are prepared to keep yourself safe from mass shootings and other dangerous situations.<p>The fact is, we haven&#x27;t taken a serious look at the causes of mass shootings. It&#x27;s a difficult problem with no clear solutions.<p>Gun control advocates muddy the waters further by blaming the attacks on the availability of guns, even though there is ample evidence that guns only turn the phrase &quot;mass killing&quot; into the phrase &quot;mass shooting&quot;. The term &quot;mass shooting&quot; itself is largely political. We don&#x27;t talk about &quot;mass burnings&quot; when people are killed with arson or &quot;mass poisonings&quot; when people are attack with poison gas.",1450566424

10765246,comment,10764268,10765044,0,0,eslaught,,,"Regent actually sits on top of a C++ runtime library called Legion[1] that supports very similar abstractions (tasks, regions, dynamic discover of dependencies, etc.). Unlike most runtime libraries, Legion was intended from the beginning as both a compilation target, and as something users could write to directly. So we do actually have experience building it both ways.<p>The advantage that Regent has over a C++ library like Legion is that the language can embody the abstractions we want to provide. With C++, there is always an impedance mismatch between how we want people to think about programming, and what C++ forces us to do. C++ code is more verbose, and the C++ type system doesn&#x27;t capture all the invariants that the programming model requires.<p>Regent code is also a lot more amenable to static analysis. In Legion, if the system needs to know some property of the program, the user needs to supply that information. (And we&#x27;re forced to trust whatever the user says---there&#x27;s no reasonable way to statically analyze arbitrary C++ to validate what they&#x27;ve given us. At best, we can check those properties at runtime, but that isn&#x27;t always feasible either.) In Regent, many of these sorts of things can be analyzed automatically, reducing the number of moving parts users have to think about. This is only possible because we&#x27;ve thought very carefully about what abstractions we need in the language---the type system is already on the edge of what is decidable, so adding anything more would make analysis intractable.<p>To be sure, C++ has its advantages too. Some users will simply never accept a new language. So, that&#x27;s why we&#x27;re doing both. And for those who prefer to stick with C++, that&#x27;s always going to be an option.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://legion.stanford.edu/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://legion.stanford.edu/</a>",1450566260

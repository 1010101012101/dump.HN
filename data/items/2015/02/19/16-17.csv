I know about the ETFs, but I&#x27;m a little puzzled by all the acronyms and variants: is there any <i>One Sacred Book</i> for the bare basics and jargon?<p>2) I can watch it on a daily basis, for up to <i>1 hour</i> distributed throughout the day.<p>3) I&#x27;m new to this world, so I have no favorite source. <i>seeking alpha</i> seems a good suggestion, the best I&#x27;ve found so far. I fully agree with you on twitter.<p>4) I know the meaning of the individual numbers, yet I feel overwhelmed when it comes to connect the dots and decide. What data or pattern do you look for when trading?<p>5) I would have <i>very little</i> to invest at first, <i>the equivalent of 1000$</i>. Given enough money, I would opt for a diversified portfolio. Is it foolish to start with such a small amount?<p>6) I guess I&#x27;ll have to try both methods and find the right mix.<p>7) Basically any event that 1 <i>sets my target apart from the competition</i> and anything that screams 2 <i>&quot;I&#x27;m going to be here X0 years from now!&quot;</i>. It could be an acquisition, changes in the Law, new production and/or distribution processes. To put in a cheesy way, it&#x27;s like looking for the one butterfly that will cause the tornado.<p>8) Diversification. However, I don&#x27;t know much outside of <i>tech</i> or what happens in YCombinator. I mainly follow TechCrunch et similia.<p>9) I&#x27;ve yet to think about it, but I&#x27;ll keep in mind all the great advice you wrote.<p>Yesterday I discovered Investopedia. The tutorials and stock simulation make it an incredible website for beginners like me.

9075027,comment,9070496,9072110,0,0,camgunz,,,"The web is a great distribution platform for one subset of applications (news, email, social, etc.) and a bad distribution platform for basically all others.  Pixlr is a great example; GIMP will do everything Pixlr does, faster, and without a network connection (yeah load time is bad, but that&#x27;s a GIMP-specific problem).  GIMP doesn&#x27;t have to pay any money, other than hosting (which an asm.js application also would have to pay) to distribute their app.  I can use GIMP without downloading it every time.  I can also continue to use GIMP if/when its developers decide to give up.  When Pixlr&#x27;s developers give up, it&#x27;s gone for good.<p>I also think pouring millions of man hours into a transpiler and JavaScript engine optimizations is probably the least efficient and most convoluted way to take advantage of the web as a distribution platform.  I think the way this should all be framed is, &quot;it would be better if browsers supported a lower-level bytecode, or more languages, or both, but that&#x27;s politically impossible to achieve, so we have asm.js&quot;.  That&#x27;s the only thing that makes sense to me here.",1424364562
9075026,comment,9073917,9073917,0,0,Iridiumkoivu,,,"Sounds like you want Debian or Debian-based distribution. I recommend you&#x27;d try vanilla Debian first because it gives you only what you want when you want it. No extra BS.<p>If you did like older OS X (10.6) you&#x27;d probably want to at least try Elementary OS which is essentially a Ubuntu on steroids and without the Canonical&#x27;s BS trying to attain the polish of OS X. I would stay away from Mint as much as possible because it&#x27;s not well optimised distribution in my opinion.<p>Even if you choose Ubuntu, you can always replace the complete desktop with something else. For example you can have Ubuntu without Unity. In fact many people do run Ubuntu with Gnome 3, KDE 4, Enlightenment e17, XFCE, CDE, or something else.<p>If Linux isn&#x27;t your thing you probably might want to also check out what FreeBSD (or PC-BSD) camp has to offer. It might be little bit more familiar for you. And if you really want, you could run Darwin with XNU kernel and have a free and open source system which is made out of the same blocks that form the core of the OS X.<p>iTerm is pretty handy on OS X. There are lots of terminal applications out there for GNU/Linux. E.g. Gnome Terminal is pretty damn good and does wrap the text. But that doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;s the only one out there.<p>As for Alfred... there are several different similar &quot;Quicksilver&quot; replacements. I&#x27;d suggest that you check Gnome-Do. But again it&#x27;s not the only one out there. You might also find it funny and useful to use something like Guake Terminal which is Quake&#x27;s console stylish terminal that you can access by pressing tilde.<p>I&#x27;m giving you Gnome programs but KDE has its own completely equivalent programs too.<p>If you&#x27;re new to GNU/Linux you probably want to start with KDE or XFCE. (Disclaimer: I&#x27;m using XFCE because it&#x27;s flexible and small.) You probably might find the kind of polish OS X offers in Gnome 3 but it requires quite a bit of tuning to &quot;feel good&quot; as a DE.",1424364552

I then back up the encrypted backups to Crashplan.<p>I tried other stuff (especially duplicity), but they just didn&#x27;t work very well for me. Restoring encrypted backups with duplicity was especially slow and annoying and even using the duply frontend it was rather fickle.<p>Bacula has some disadvantages though... for one it is a bit complicated to get working. It&#x27;s partitioned into multiple daemons, each of which handles a different task and which can be on different machines. This makes it flexible, but also makes the configuration more complicated. It also works best if you have a central backup server that can run the director and storage daemons 24/7. You can set it up to work all on one computer and just dump to a &quot;dumb&quot; storage drive, but it is really designed to work with a central server.",1424364533

9074735,comment,9070496,9072053,0,0,camgunz,,,"1. The point I was making is that a lot of asm.js proponents argue that compared to PNaCl, asm.js isn&#x27;t a binary blob, and is easier to examine and modify.  While I agree this is true, I&#x27;m not sure how much it matters; it&#x27;s still very hard to read and work with Emscripten-generated asm.js code.  You can write it by hand for improved readability, but that&#x27;s not a lot of fun either.<p>I disagree that asm.js isn&#x27;t trying to implement &#x27;<script type=&quot;text/lua&quot;>&#x27;, and is only interested in unseating Silverlight/Flash.  Alon Zakai argues for asm.js becoming the bytecode format of the web, and advocates for compiling the runtimes of other languages to JS using Emscripten.<p>2. I read about PyPyJS a while ago, the way it works is by compiling the PyPy interpreter into JavaScript using Emscripten.  I don&#x27;t think you&#x27;ll ever see TerraLang ported because it relies on LuaJIT.  AFAIK, every large user of asm.js uses Emscripten, because asm.js is such a bear to work with manually.  That&#x27;s fine, but to me (again), lock-in is lock-in.  I&#x27;d be really surprised to see a non-LLVM solution crop up.<p>3. I think &quot;runs&quot; implies some level of acceptable performance.  Try running asm.js code in IE, for example.  Even in browsers that have a lot of optimizations (asm.js-specific and not), performance varies between 1.5x-2x of Firefox&#x27;, and 3x-4x of native code (<a href=""http://arewefastyet.com/#machine=29&view=breakdown&suite=asmjs-apps"" rel=""nofollow"">http://arewefastyet.com/#machine=29&view=breakdown&suite=asm...</a>).  This is still impressive theoretically, but pragmatically that&#x27;s a huge performance hit.  It&#x27;s also important to remember these are very current browsers on very current platforms, and you&#x27;re assuming a lot of other things, a fat network pipe to download a huge JS blob among them.<p>For example, I could run a PlayStation emulator on my phone and barely get a proper framerate.  If you put this same emulator in asm.js using Emscripten, it would run half as fast at best (in Firefox), and we haven&#x27;t addressed all the other problems with HTML5: skipping audio, high latency on input (mouse, controllers), networking performance, etc.<p>Or for another example, let&#x27;s say I can play Call of Duty 5000 on my new PC at 60 FPS.  Handwaving a lot, let&#x27;s also say I can play Monster Madness on the same PC at 30 FPS, because of the 50% drop due to asm.js.  But let&#x27;s also say I bought a laptop a couple years ago that runs CoD 5k at 30 FPS, but Monster Madness runs at an unplayable 15 FPS.  You can argue, &quot;just run the native version!&quot;.  But at that point, why am I bothering with asm.js at all?  To avoid installations?  While that can be important, I&#x27;m not sure it&#x27;s worth millions of man hours and dollars.<p>(I know Monster Madness is nowhere near as demanding as a hypothetical Call of Duty 5000 would be, but I hope you get the point I was trying to make)<p>To summarize, asm.js enables zero-install, sandboxed, cross-platform applications at a huge technical price (even though you&#x27;re technically installing the app every time you load it up, caching excepted of course).  I&#x27;m not at all convinced we can&#x27;t achieve the same goals in a much simpler way.<p>---<p>Finally, we haven&#x27;t even begun to discuss the security implications of running untrusted software that can be modified in transit.  I know it&#x27;s kind of a rabbit hole (computers aren&#x27;t born with all the software you need installed, it has to come from somewhere).  But I do think when we&#x27;re talking about communications applications, banking applications, the potential insecurity of zero-install apps is troubling.",1424361917

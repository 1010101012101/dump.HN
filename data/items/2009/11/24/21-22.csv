On the one hand, learning to use a fancy development tool effectively takes time and effort, and that's time and effort that often can't be used to understand what's going on under the covers. And then you're stuck learning about the inner workings anyway when something fails to build with some kind of vague error message.<p>But in the long run the automation provided by high-level development tools makes for more productive programming, and the time spent learning to use them is usually paid back handsomely.<p>My advice would be to do a few projects using little more than command-line tools (and no project templates), but then don't get stuck in a rut and <i>do</i> take the time to learn how to automate things and generally make your life easier with higher-level tools.<p>With debuggers in particular there are classes of bugs where logging (or worse, Response.Write/echo/puts debugging) is pretty ineffective: if an integer is being interpreted as a string where you expected a number, printing out the value in a log file doesn't give you much insight into what's going wrong.",1259098638

I have seen some theoretical algorithms, but they seem unlikely to perform well with classical databases. Also, the books usually don't mention how to handle incremental growth of the data set. Suppose I use a standard k-means clustering algorithm, it seems unreasonable to shift thousands of nodes around just because of one new entry (and with a classical db, that would be a lot of writes).<p>I almost suspect there is no way around creating custom solutions - like attempting to keep useful parts of the data in memory. For inserting new entries, I suppose the existing nodes could be updated by and by. I hope that at least some of the algorithms react benign to being twisted (for example in k-means there is a lot of variability in how to define distance and attraction).<p>Does a graph database like neo4J even help much?

I'd more like to hear suggestions on what we should do next...<p>Background:<p>As a project to learn Objective-c we decided to remake an old flash game we'd made several years ago that had been popular at the time. The game is basically ""simon"" (remember the flashing lights sequence) but tapping CGI bikini covered women on their behinds, in the memorised order. As you go through the game you win various awards which are represented as playing cards with photos of women in bikinis on them.<p>We've been rejected for several reasons over the last 5 months, some of which were without ANY given reason, others for reasons where one may disagree with them but you can at least see where they are coming from. (e.g. tapping women was considered violence aginst women, so we changed it to a feather tickling them, which was also considered derogatory - we now have a set of drums in front of each and they just dance to specific ""beats"")<p>Having gone through all of these rejections including one reviewer who called us and told us that if we changed it from the feather tickling to drums then we would almost certainly get approved, we have now been rejected again. This time because one or some of the award cards can be seen as ""objectionable content"".<p>The images we use are all PG13 at the absolute worst, but we've rated the app at 17+ in the app store. As usual there are apps already out there with far worse images but that isn't really an argument we can put to anyone.<p>An email back to the review team asking which cards were considered objectionable was met with a copy and paste from the T&Cs (Section 3.3.14).<p>As this project was a learning experience that has led on to other work and projects it's not been a complete loss and we never expected to get rich from it, but it has been a frustrating experience (one we've not had with our other apps, all of which are non-adult themed.)<p>We're staying positive and looking at the options\nDo we:<p>a) keep trying to appease the different reviewers we get assigned who have different levels of judgement. We feel like we are working in the dark though.<p>b) just take out all the awards, leaving a game that TBH isn't unique and certainly not worth selling<p>c) try selling via a jailbreak site such as cydia, might this harm our relationship with Apple down the line?<p>d) Put large semi-sarcastic ""censored"" text over each image and release it as a free game?<p>e) Not waste any time on it and ditch it?<p>f) something else?<p>Thanks for any input",1259098366
959991,comment,959552,959552,0,0,amalcon,,,"Some types of RPGs do have another attraction, that appeals to the ""Master"" style:  they give you a single system, and steadily tack options onto it.  While your character does improve as a result of this, if the game is well-designed, the difficulty remains roughly constant or increases over the course of the game.  This gives you the opportunity to master aspects of the system in more manageable chunks.  That is, it takes a complex system that would normally require a tutorial, and spreads the tutorial out over the whole game.<p>FPS/RPG hybrids often have this, the most notable I can think of being Deus Ex (Bioshock is a passable example, but nowhere near as complex in the endgame).  Action and strategy RPGs have this if played in a certain way, though most of them are just really easy to begin with.  Roguelikes have this in spades.  The combat in pen-and-paper dungeons and dragons can have this.<p>Console-style RPGs like the Final Fantasy and Dragon Quest series usually don't have this.  MMORPGs usually don't have this as such; rather, they usually have two almost independent games (beginning-game and endgame).",1259098352

One thing we'd like to have on our site is a news section where we can cover breaking news that we feel is relavent to our readers.<p>Are there proper guidelines for sourcing where you find the news you are covering.  For example, if I find out about a news article via another news site, can I go to the source and bypass giving credit to the place where I found the post?<p>I've noticed on engadget that they provide two source links.  One call ""via"" that covers the blog that posted on the topic and one called ""source"" that goes to the core article or press release.  I'm wondering why engadget would give attribute to the ""via"" and not just post the source.  Maybe these were tips sent to them and they decide to give credit to the blogs that gave them the tip.<p>Any guides on this topic is appreciated.",1259097123

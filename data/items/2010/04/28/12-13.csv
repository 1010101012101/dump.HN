A total of 19,605,052 shares were offered at a price of $85 per share.[27] Of that, 14,142,135 (another mathematical reference as √2 ≈ 1.4142135) were floated by Google and 5,462,917 by selling stockholders. The sale raised US$1.67 billion, and gave Google a market capitalization of more than $23 billion.[28]<p>So - assuming the market established a price of $110, and the sold at $85. Google lost out 14,142,135 x $20. Now $280M is not to be sniffed at, but for a company with a market cap of $23,000M it's little over 1% of it's value.  Given the shares had risen 25% on the opening day, 1% is not really material.<p>Given that the company was cash flow positive, the difference between raising $1.67B and and $1.93B of would probably not have any operation affect on the business.",1272459376

Of course they were joined by the Investment Banks who really like that 7% standard IPO fee and felt threatened.  And the press to whom everything is either an epic success or huge failure.<p>As a first, the deal also had many technical issues which lead to the August pricing and fed the negativity.<p>Anyway, the key win was that anyone (even a tiny investor like me) could buy in the IPO.

I know I was certainly guilty of this when I was working in Delphi, less so nowadays. \n(And if Raymond Chen's stories are any indicator, developers in general are too lazy to RTFM at all, why would they bother looking for any guidelines for a low priority task.)<p>If you develop a desktop app on your company's time, your boss will find a million more important things to do than to make sure keyboard accelerators work, make sense, or are configurable. If you do it on your own, you will probably find a different million of things to improve, like the main number crunching loop. After all, you're coding it primarily for yourself so why do you care what Alt-W or Ctrl-U do in your app, you use the mouse. Maybe if you publish it, you'll get some feedback from users and you fix it, but it's more likely that they'll just decide it's ""no more limited than that other tool"" and you'll never know that it is a problem for them.<p>Not to mention there are varied GUI toolkits available depending on the programming language you use, each with its own style - Borland's VCL, especially with its button graphics which stand out to this day; MFC; wxWidgets... each with their own idea of how things should be handled. And there's OwnerDraw, giving the more ""hardcore"" coders another chance to shoot themselves in the foot by allowing the application to draw the control as it saw fit, which of course means they cannot take advantage of the new Windows common controls themes.",1272458514

Timing worked in my favor - her contract wasn't renewed by the company she was working at when I got permission to hire two contractors.  I had been staying in contact and gently recruiting her for a couple of months.  She became unexpectedly available, she called me up and we brought her in immediately.  I know a handful of great hackers and I've pretty much added her to the group.<p>I was socially connected to the other person and knew he was smart and committed.  I wasn't sure if his tech skills would be too rusty (he had been working on software outsourcing business development, working with overseas dev shops for an app outsourcer here), but I knew he'd work twice as hard as anybody else.  Plus, he's the kind of guy who spent time learning Vietnamese when he was working with a Vietnamese software shop remotely.  How can you doubt that someone willing to go that far just to make sure that communication is good?  It's been a real win with him as well, he's picked up the medical research side of things much better than I have and has more than exceeded what I expected from a technical perspective.<p>My role is a little weird.

But it does seem true that with a great mentor and lots of practice, many people will achieve greatness regardless of what their ""IQ"" score might be measured that week.",1206161920

Coming out it is hard to get a legitimate job, and they've learned more criminal skills while in prison.  It's much easier to just go right back into the criminal lifestyle, a vicious cycle.<p>However, a concern I have with this program is that gang members can bring their criminal connections with them into business.  In times of tough competition they may be tempted to use these connections.",1206161319

143107,comment,142441,142441,0,0,skmurphy,,,"Save your money and cut your personal burn rate. This takes maximum advantage of your ""great salary"" in the best way possible. If you are working on a good team in a ""pocket of excellence"" in a decaying organization either your team will help to revitalize and reverse the situation or you will be overwhelmed by the slow failure of the larger organization. Have a plan now for how you are going to exploit your success (whether in follow on projects with the same team at the firm or in doing something new) and a risk mitigation plan for how you will judge that the project is not going to succeed (or be overwhelmed by the decline of the company). If smart colleagues are leaving your team for better opportunities then it's unlikely the team will succeed. There is a lot of value in seeing a project through to launch (and volume) but you have to be careful to avoid the ""monkey trap"" of a good salary and the natural inertia of continuing to work on what you've been doing.",1206159783

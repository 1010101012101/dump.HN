Subtract several years for when that essay was written, then subtract ten years for when the statement is set in, and you'll encounter a different world.<p><i>Today</i> there's no great reason not to write your desktop app in PyQT or Clojure or on top of XULRunner. (Although I'd point out that surprisingly few people have noticed this!) ViaWeb was born into a different world. I didn't do much desktop programming in the 1996 timeframe, but you did not have many choices, especially if you were a student that couldn't drop ~$1000 2009-dollars into a programming language environment. (Now my new supercomputer-laptop costs less than that and superior environments are free. Vive la progress!) A couple that weren't C and, as it turns out, all doomed to be unsupported within a few years anyhow, like Delphi. I talk about 1996 because it's when I got into the game; the essay is a talk given in 2001 which means ""ten years ago"" is 1991.",1242226610

If you like things compressed horizontally, set your tab width to 2.  If you want things really spacious, set it to 8.  Spaces don't give individuals the option to tailor for their preferences.<p>There are two non-trivial issues in this debate though:<p>1) mixing spaces and tabs is undeniable evil.  Everyone on your team needs to conform to one or the other.  (And since I like spaces, everyone should use spaces ;-). )<p>2) In a layout-based syntax like Haskell's, you cannot set your tab width willy-nilly.  The syntax defines a tab as equivalent to 8 spaces.  Vary this in your editor at your peril.",1242226594

The correct question is, ""How much do I trust the pharmaceutical companies and all relevant regulatory agencies?""<p>And the answer is... not entirely. That would be stupid. On the other hand, they <i>do</i> in fact conduct drug trials, and so far I have not had a prescription for the mega-profitable drugs, so I'm not overwhelmingly concerned about whether or not they cheated with their antibiotic tests. I haven't needed an antidepressant, cholesterol medication (which I'm unconvinced actually help), or anything else that might actually be a problem. (And at this point I wouldn't touch a weight-loss pill; evidence would suggest at this point that whatever it takes to fool the body into losing weight when it wouldn't otherwise is virtually certain to mess with your heart, which is one of the prime reasons for losing weight in the first place.)<p>The question is some sort of binary ""trust open source or trust the evil commercial interests!"". It's actually ""do I trust a possibly flawed system that still uses science, or am I so concerned about it that I'm willing to switch over to a system that can't afford to do science at all?"" Some science is, all else being equal, better than no science at all.<p>""But I guarantee you that if a person is suffering from an illness and cannot afford the drugs for treatment, they'll be willing to try any sort of chemistry that may help.""<p>Only if they are in a situation that can't possibly get worse. I support the aggressive deployment of possible cancer remedies in the cases where we can tell somebody has a week to live, for instance, which our government won't do. Very little can go wrong that is worse than doing nothing. But drugs can have arbitrarily bad side effects that only emerge for a small set of people, and throwing more drugs into the mix will only increase that number. And, best of all, while doctors know about the standard drug reactions, they'll know nothing about your home-grown concoction.<p>Example: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toxic_epidermal_necrolysis"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toxic_epidermal_necrolysis</a><p>Installing something on my hard drive is radically, radically different than installing something into <i>me</i>.",1242226270

My favorite piece of advice:<p><i>Many successful app vendors are trying to create APIs that will enable other developers to extend their products. This is the right idea, but the implementation is often off-target. Many of the app companies I talk to are trying to make their APIs into the business equivalent of an operating system, with developers coming to them and living entirely within their private ecosystem. A warning sign is when a company uses a phrase like, ""(insert company name) developer network"" to describe its offering.</i><p><i>The wave of the future is not turning an application inward into its own little walled garden; it's opening the application outward so it can be mixed and matched with other functionality in the metaplatform. If you have the best drawing program in the industry, you should be asking how you can also become the best drawing module in the metaplatform.

Not much different than an XML file sitting beside of a script, except that<p>1) it's more DRY because for external files to <i>say</i> something about a construct in code there is repeated information, i.e. <route><to><class>Foo</class><method>bar</method></to><from><method>GET</method><url>some/url/here</url></to></route>,<p>2) because you're using the PHP language to specify metadata about a PHP construct refactoring is easier, i.e. change the name of a function and you don't have to go update your routing somewhere else,<p>3) having the metadata inline with code turns out to be mentally lightweight once you get over the initial shock of seeing metadata in a comment.",1242224645

Later you can use the empirical distribution you encounter in the wild.<p>First, the distribution is useful for running simulations of your placement algorithm(s).  Also without a distribution your are limited to analysing worst-case-scenarios.  With a distribution of inputs you can also take a look at the distribution of outputs that your method achieves.  Suppose you measure the quality of your output with a single number, than you can look at certain quantiles - like the median outcome. Or the 95%-quantile, that will be closer to the worst case scenario, but not as pathological.<p>Second, to give an extreme example: Say you'd know everything about the coming demands, then you no longer had to use an online algorithm.  But even much more limited knowledge will help you prepare for the future.",1242224594

I've long been looking forward to presenting my own app in HN but since were based in Berlin, Germany expect a butchering of the English grammar in my posts :)<p>SquadMail les you create email folders and invite others to them. The folder content is continuously synced among all collaborators. SquadMail works 100% server-sided so you dont need any downloads or software installation, you can use it with every email client (incl. Gmail) and it takes no more than 15 seconds to get started!<p>But besides shared cloud space theres a ton of really cool things you can use SquadMail for that Id like your opinion on:<p>1) All folders get their own email address. You could for example open a folder Newsletters and use that folders address for all your subscriptions. That way you never have to give a  third-party advertiser your real email address, all newsletters come directly sorted into their folder and when you dont want to get the newsletter anymore you can simply remove the sender from the collaborator list. Also, how about adding friends to the folder so you guys have something like a common newsletter reading room :)<p>2) When you cant access your private email at work and auto-fwd is not an option just open a folder called for example Portal and add both email addresses. Make sure your private email automatically sends a copy of all incoming messages to Portal and youre ready to go!<p>3) SquadMail stores replies in the same folder as well if you want than (otherwise uncheck the tickbox in the folder settings). Imagine you and your roommate look for another person to move in with you. Simply put the folder email address in the add and now both of you can reply to incoming emails and see what the other on wrote, when meetings are set up and so on.<p>4) The app also provides the easiest way of setting up platform independent group email. Some friends and I share a folder for funny stuff. Whenever one of us finds something good he sends it to funmail<i></i><i></i><i></i><i></i>@box.squadmail.com everyone gets it. Since the stuff will never end up in your main inbox it also works for everything NSFW :)<p>At https://www.squadmail.com/login/register?auth=HKNS39fGqsD you can directly register for the app without an invite.<p>Looking forward to your feedback and questions!<p>All the best,<p>Phil",1326456344

3460201,comment,3457930,3460128,2,0,cookiecaper,,,"I suppose ""unmaintained"" was incorrect, I probably should have said ""not well maintained"". I was going off of the notice on the HPN-SSH website at PSC: <a href=""http://www.psc.edu/networking/projects/hpn-ssh/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.psc.edu/networking/projects/hpn-ssh/</a>, which has a large bold header that repeatedly says that updates are ""delayed"" because all funding for the project is gone and there are no interested sponsors. So while not technically abandoned, the project is apparently ""on the ropes"" and further updates are questionable.<p>I usually use SSH on my local network too, but I usually max out the capacity of my disk in transfer speed anyway (gigabit network, but disk max read/write is ~30MB/s sustained), and there are definitely some fairly simple alternatives to local SSH usage if it's not fast enough in a particular situation (which I haven't encountered personally).<p>Of course, this doesn't mean HPN-SSH is useless, but its utility may manifest only in a small number of cases, making continued interest in maintenance or funding unlikely.",1326456215

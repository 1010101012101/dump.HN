12051,comment,12010,12010,0,0,Stuzo,,,"PayPal or Google Checkout are both good ways to start out with.   But depending on the volume of transactions and the amount of control you want you may want to go with your own merchant account.  They are not hard at all to set up.  Talk to your current bank to see if they have an arm that deals with merchant accounts.  Most banks that offer business accounts either have their own or partner with a third party to provide the services to customers.  Note that you will need an SSL certificate if you go with a merchant account.  Id recommend VeriSign ( they will also most likely end up being your Payment Gateway if you do decide to set up your own merchant account).  Their SSL certificates are a bit pricy, but the most trusted name in the business.   You want to make sure you get a low processing fee (percent of the transaction that the bank ends up taking  shoot for under 2% and a low per transaction fee (shoot for 20 cents or lower  hard to find).  After a lot of shopping around, we ended up going with Bank of America.  Best of luck!  ",1176324165

12049,comment,12010,12010,0,0,elialfordj,,,"I've researched both paypal and authorize.net pretty thoroughly. For starters, I ended up with authorize.net. To first compare features though: Paypal offers what I believe they call the ""paylink"" feature. This is where the user is redirected to a paypal site (off of your own website) to make their purchase. The good thing about this for retail driven commerce is that it will interface well with a shopping cart system. I believe it either has no monthly charge or a very minimal one (also you won't need your own SSL). Above this, both companies have an API (or an application programming interface). To use Paypal's API you need to subscribe to their ""payflow pro"" program. This is about $40-50 mo. Authorize.net has API integration for about $30 I think. But then you need a merchant bank account which you can get through them for another $10. For those who aren't familiar, through an API you can set up a payment system that is built into your own site, which relays the data to the payment gateway. This is obviously the best option for serious merchants of any kind.<p>When accepting credit cards you'll also need a SSL (Secure Socket Layer) or in other words a secure connection (https://). I think they will actually allow you to use their api without that but it's definitely a horrible idea. There are a few major providers of this service, and they range in price significantly. www.InstantSSL.com or ""Comodo"" as they call themselves, has a pretty decent mid range SSL encryption package for about $100 a year. Godaddy.com has one that's like 19.99 or something ridiculous. The issue with SSL providers is simple. You can bet that they are all perfectly secure. The issue is really in browser recognition. The worst thing ever for an online merchant is to loose credibility, and what's the fastest way to appear disreputable - """"this site may not be secure, internet explorer recommends that you leave it immediately"" or what ever that error says. This happens when a browser doesn't recognize the security certificate. To be safe, go with a provider that you can guarantee is trusted by all the major browsers (even old versions).<p>Also - one last piece of advice. When subscribing for a SSL certificate make SURE to turn your domain anonymity off temporairly while you subscribe. Otherwise they'll put you through an endless ""verification"" process that involves multiple faxes and endless bureaucracy!!!

12042,comment,11947,11947,0,0,cwilbur,,,"Sometimes I really regret the computer science major.  The things I learned were right, but the credential was wrong -- it basically certified me as sufficiently trained to work in IT cubicle hell.  (It was really a math degree at its core, and it made me a problem-solving generalist, which is not what Industry wants.)  I considered dropping it, but it was so easy to do what I needed for the additional credential -- it was a matter of two classes I wouldn't otherwise have taken.<p>I regret not recognizing the intensely political nature of my masters' degree program before it was too late to do anything about it.  I've thought about going back to a different school, getting the PhD, and trying to scale the ivory tower, but I don't think the payoff I can realistically expect is worth the investment.  It's not like a PhD in Renaissance music theory makes you any more employable in the ""real world,"" and academic positions are few and far between, and there is so much of a surplus of good professors that some of the best are eking out a living teaching as adjuncts at community college.",1176322891

Once you've put in a little bit of work getting these elements together you're good to go. It also allows you to add additional pages, auto page number, import images... you name it.

Although Linux is making significant rounds for servers in the corporate world Microsoft is still the office PC leader. web 2.0 will never break into this coporate niche just due to the flow of information out of the secure office. However this is not to say the application can not come IN house. This is how they must be sold to corporations. That and the price of training new hires on the linux based platform with web apps.<p>If enough companies train enough people then the ""we use microsoft because everyone knows it"" excuse will be out the window.

For some reason, python seems to be the perfect fit, and I have a new sense of desire to code.

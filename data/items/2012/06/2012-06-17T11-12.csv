4122720,comment,4121698,4122685,1,0,DanBC,,,"Okay, I make a clear distinction between community up / down voting, and owner moderation.  I should have been clearer.<p>Don't worry about the down votes.  They are frustrating, but anyone on HN knows that you occasionally get a random down vote. By themselves they're usually meaningless.  Yes, people should really either engage in the debate and not down vote, or not engage, and down vote, and explain if needed.  (Personally, reasons for down voting should be restricted to ""this comment does not belong here; it adds nothing to the discussion"".)<p>I think there's general agreement about voting on HN - up vote things that are well written, even if you disagree.  Don't down vote just because you disagree.  Down vote things that add nothing to the discussion.  Flag spam or other blatantly harmful stuff.<p>But all of that is separate from the issue of trusted people within HN locking threads, deleting threads, deleting posts, changing titles, banning users, etc.<p>> <i>No insight and no accountability = bad moderation practices.</i><p>I honestly truly disagree with this.  Strongly.<p>It's really simple to say ""Here are a list of rules.  Don't break them or we mod your posts"".  But when Bob starts skirting the rules there can be huge flamewars.  Bob says he clearly wasn't breaking any rules, mods say he was, other people jump in saying that he wasn't and the mod is dumb and has made a bunch of similar stupid decisions, then other people jump in and say that maybe Bob was a bit close but he does so much good that we can make an exception for him, then other people leap in and say it's a stupid rule anyway.  Meanwhile, this thread is getting so much attention that the real stuff of the forum is being ignored.  New users are not interested in that stuff.  The thread creates an unpleasant atmosphere which is noticed by other people.  Now whenever Bob replies to someone who's a mod there's suspicion that Bob is just flame-baiting.<p>Anyway, I'm doing what I hate, so I apologies to everyone on HN.

Since each time we used the word we would be training our brain to discriminate between color input patterns whose differences are not stark. Colors with no labels would not get many opportunities to be learned, but for the called out colors, on each use it would strengthen the connections between which ever set of associated neurons.<p>Language is not the only thing to train this difference. Hobbies and jobs should be able to as well. I suspect artists and photographers perceive subtle color gradations better than non artists; audiophiles, dancers, and musicians can pick out tempo and pitch much more readily, blind people can pick out echo patterns, engineers perceive catastrophic corner cases where normal people see an idea and a botanist sees a whole world where I just see grass and trees.",1339931927

Some places do offer bug bounties, and of course you have the usual ZDI, pwn2own etc. that you can go through, but from my own personal experience I've been ignored, threatened with legal action and dragged into a quagmire of free IT support because the manager handling the bug won't let me speak to a developer and doesn't understand the bug amongst other things.<p>On the other hand, finding a bug isn't hard, but developing a reliable weaponised exploit that works repeatably against multiple targets can be a heck of a lot more work.<p>My own personal view when it comes to disclosure is 'finders keepers'. It's my bug, I found it. It's not worth my time weaponising it to sell on the black market and it's too high risk for me personally to be associated as being active in it, it's only worth weaponising to the point where I can use it in future on pentests and help customers implement workarounds.<p>> The sellers are willing to inflict damage on everyone else so they can benefit.

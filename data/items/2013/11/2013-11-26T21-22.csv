You see, domain registration becomes addictive, when you get an idea, you are so convinced that it would work and it will make you rich (probably) over night. I&#x27;ve fallen for this trap too, I registered some top notch domains in a span of 2 years, amounting to a total of ~50+ domains because of that sudden impulsive urge - &quot;Oh, it&#x27;s available! I should register it ASAP!&quot;<p>Contrary to popular belief, there is (in my personal experience) not much (monetary) value for domains as the registrars and the others might want you to believe. I registered some really short, cool names that were estimated by &#x27;domain experts&#x27;/appraisals estimating some of my so called premium domains for $1000&#x27;s of dollars, yet in the end, I had to pay money to domain marketplaces (like GoDaddy) to list my domain for sale, only to discover that the demand isn&#x27;t just there at all. A few scammers contacted me about their domain appraisal and brokerage services and that was just it. And unless you have a really really valuable domain that has some actual traffic in it, this is not worth investing your money in.<p>So, I just let the domains expire one by one. At first it was kind of painful, but after two painful years and after losing $1000+ dollars, I can tell you that when you have the actual product ready, the domain will be the least of your problems.",1385503173

It&#x27;s not a fallacy - if you have reason to believe your currency will be worth more tomorrow, you shouldn&#x27;t spend it unless you absolutely have to.<p>On the other hand it makes a lot of sense for vendors to <i>accept</i> BitCoin for the very same reason. If you are a vendor, why wouldn&#x27;t you want to accept something that could appreciate in value 10-fold, 20-fold tomorrow? Unless, of course, you instantly convert it into dollars.<p>This is why BitCoin will eventually be useful as a currency. This produces a network effect. More vendors will accept currency because it is so valuable so the currency will become more and more useful to consumers as time goes on. The value of being in the network is enough of a reason to join the network, until some plateau is reached.<p>I don&#x27;t think BitCoin will be particularly useful as a currency until it stabilizes in value.

Even family and friends , it&#x27;s difficult to watch someone manage their pain with pot and videogames or TV and not conclude they&#x27;re they&#x27;re just being deliberately useless and that you should withdraw support &quot;for their own good&quot;.<p>People argue that if you can play games then you can do menial office work, but unskilled office labor pools generally don&#x27;t tolerate you taking a ton of sick time because you need to spend all day curled in a ball crying, drugged to sleep for pain, or because you&#x27;re pooping five times an hour. The job market is such that they can just hand your job to someone healthier, and they usually will without considering the labor law of their jurisdiction, you could challenge that but its probably a waste of time. If you can keep them, these jobs probably also don&#x27;t include health coverage.<p>This is where the later phases of will ACA become valuable to you, but until then and otherwise (say if its opponents finally manage to kill it), if you have no money or health coverage its pretty fucking hard to get a diagnosis. For pain, if you can&#x27;t pay much for a doctor you get to spend 90% of every appointment just trying to convince your doctors that you&#x27;re not a junkie. For anything behavioral, that end of the care market seems to mostly either be a joke where they shrug and throw prescription samples at you or a nightmare where they try to hospitalize you.<p>Even with a diagnosis you are not likely to be deemed eligible. Then you get to argue your case which requires finding a litigator willing to bet you&#x27;ll win and some years.<p>Some assistance you&#x27;re just automatically not eligible for if you&#x27;re attending school, with the idea that you&#x27;d instead use the financial aid systems specifically in place for that situation, not considering that maybe aren&#x27;t eligible because your parents make too much, or they refuse to even file taxes so you can prove what they make, or even in the case that you&#x27;re independent if past health issues affected your grade average too harshly.<p>Doing all of this yourself (because you have zero social support because friends and family all think you&#x27;re just lazy or a druggie) with your condition is difficult to say the least.<p>Meanwhile you&#x27;re vagrant because there&#x27;s nothing in place to help you unless and until you win your case(s) for eligibility or wrongful termination, or for getting things stricken from your education record.<p>And that&#x27;s if you&#x27;re even fully educated on what your options for care are. Many people just don&#x27;t know how to begin seeking free mental care, free clinics or that they could try to find a lawyer that would help them seek SSDI, some are homeless and have no phones internet or mail, some of them are single parents doing everything they can just to continue to have jobs, others have behavioral problems and wrongly perceive that these options will fail so can&#x27;t generate the will to try them.<p>Sure, the US has nets, but they&#x27;re not so big that you don&#x27;t have to aim for them as you&#x27;re falling.<p>I guess there&#x27;s a logical position that you could hold that the people in those situations don&#x27;t matter: if they can&#x27;t even help themselves why should we help them, if it&#x27;s impossible to distinguish them from lazy people then we shouldn&#x27;t help them lest we increase opportunity for fraud, but I reserve the completely subjective opinion that such a position is terrible and irresponsible.",1385501656

There are all sorts of solutions that could be implemented to both increase availability of medicine while still offering consumer protection.<p>Yes, PhDs make mistakes, but that wasn’t the point of the Vioxx reference.  Vioxx was a <i>fantastic</i> pain drug that worked for some people when nothing else would.  And that drug was taken away because Vioxx might increase the risk of heart attack.  While this may sound fine to you, it was devastating to many people who would have preferred even a large risk of heart attack rather than living with the pain eliminated by Vioxx.

6804345,comment,6803059,6803636,2,0,ChuckMcM,,,"Perhaps surprisingly I think we agree.<p>Your anecdote, and the original article, have the same form. Allow me to abstract it a bit and tell me if I screw it up.<p>We have in one hand a &quot;job&quot; which has some set of properties associated with it; Hours needed to do it, responsibilities,  tools, and environment in which to do it. And we have this independent variable, compensation.<p>Now lets take your anecdote first and change the conditions in a wild way in order to reason about it. Let&#x27;s say that nothing in your anecdote changes <i>except</i> that instead of &#x27;beer money&#x27; it was &quot;$100,000 a week&quot;.<p>That is an extraordinary amount of money per week for someone to make would you agree? If without a &quot;stake in the company&quot; would you have looked back fondly on your time there? Along the lines of &quot;it was a crazy work schedule with people who were clueless but man the money was sweet.&quot; ?<p>What I&#x27;m trying to demonstrate is that there is a &quot;value&quot; received when working somewhere. It is more complex than just &quot;cash&quot; it has elements of ownership, cash, people, tools, location, and mission.<p>I&#x27;ve hired consultants that their bottom line was cash per week. They had a goal of some amount of cash by some point in time and they could be sorting pennies by minting date all day long and be fine with it if it met their cash flow goal.<p>I&#x27;ve known people continue to work on stuff after the company ceased to exist because it was something they were really committed to getting done.<p>I have come to conclude that the value someone gets from doing a particular job is a deeply personal thing and unique and made up from a variety of factors some of which I can control and some of which I cannot. When people are reasonably self aware about what it is they value they can make good choices about what compensation they would need to work somewhere. And those values can <i>change over time</i>.<p>So back to your anecdote, when you started the job it met all your compensation needs (beer money, decompressing) after a while it didn&#x27;t (no equity, no health insurance, poor predictability of pay), perhaps because once you had &quot;decompressed&quot; you were once again thinking about the future and the relative value of things like health insurance rose in your list. I knew a guy who fell in love with the girl of his dreams and she was constrained to living in Livermore, a 2 hr commute to the southern part of the Bay Area. You could not pay him enough to stay in his job, he changed to a job in Livermore. The values changed over time.<p>So let&#x27;s get to where we disagree, the characterization of the Penny Arcade job as a &quot;set up&quot;.<p>For me, the term &#x27;set up&#x27; implies fraud. And yet the terms of the job are very clearly spelled out in the job listing. Given that level of clarity I have no trouble believing that they would be as forthcoming in person as well (but could be wrong there). You and I can read it, &quot;If you want equity you need not apply&quot; or as Chris read it &quot;PA isn&#x27;t interested in sharing any <i>wealth</i> with you.&quot; and in both cases forewarned is forearmed. But they already said they wouldn&#x27;t and presumably people who value equity will, in fact, not apply (or at least ask if that is a possibility prior to applying)<p>So end of the day. I don&#x27;t agree Penny Arcade is being misleading or &#x27;setting someone up&#x27; to be exploited. While I can understand that someone whose value equation isn&#x27;t met by what they are offering would consider themselves &quot;exploited&quot; if they were forced into that sort of labor contract.

You can&#x27;t really run away from the trial forever, hide behind the &quot;presumed innocent&quot; doctrine, and say it makes you a saint.

Lying about using a condom potentially exposes your partner to myriad health problems, in addition to unwanted pregnancy. So no, it isn&#x27;t equivalent to lying about using the pill - lying about the pill doesn&#x27;t change your risk of contracting HPV, HIV, etc.<p>If a woman lies about using birth control, and she does conceive, she&#x27;s either going to have an abortion (which is physically and psychologically traumatic), or go through pregnancy and birth.

(I could prove it using just what I remember from a couple of semesters of undergrad signal processing courses.)<p>Of course a <i>low</i> sampling rate can result in errors, but what the sampling theorem says is that we can calculate exactly how high a rate we need to always perfectly reconstruct signals in a given band.  This doesn&#x27;t change just because your signal is constructed from many component signals.<p>Of course, if you think the math is wrong, then you have an easy way to disprove it:  Construct a counterexample out of &quot;many waves interacting&quot; and show that the resulting signal isn&#x27;t perfectly reconstructed as the Sampling Theorem claims.

People would often tell me in interviews/appraisals that it didn&#x27;t matter how good I was at my job, the most important thing was my ability to communicate.<p>There&#x27;s an increasing pressure to socialise everywhere - from open-plan offices and group nights to ever more frequent team meetings.

They&#x27;ll ask pointed questions in the interview process that will expose any lie on your CV. Do you need to be a &quot;Do-Everything Rock Star&quot; to do the job? Not likely. Do they want someone who will work their ass off for less than industry standard pay? Probably. Will it really be that hard? Probably not. They&#x27;ve survived for 15 years without a dedicated resource. While the job posting may speak of an incredibly intimidating position, I sincerely doubt that the person that gets it will be up all night troubleshooting complicated python scripts. \nI get that it&#x27;s super cool to shit on Penny Arcade. It drives a lot of traffic to website and sometimes they deserve the vitriol. If they were a start up promising a new social media blah blah blah bullshit I&#x27;d have a big old hate hard on too. They&#x27;re not. They&#x27;re an established 15 year only internet media company that&#x27;s looking to bring talent in house. The expectations of the job posting are absurd for sure. I think it&#x27;s only meant to weed out fan boys that run their own CounterStrike server and think they could be the PA IT guy.",1385499601

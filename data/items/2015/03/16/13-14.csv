I guess that&#x27;s where my biggest pain point going from sql first to writing my classes is getting the tables to validate and map properly. It&#x27;s been a little time consuming being new to the ecosystem trying to get my sql (postgres) to map to JPA Entity classes going in reverse. Going from Entity classes to SQL you don&#x27;t have this issue because the tool is writing the SQL for you (not saying this is the best approach) so without this a tool for debugging Entities would be handy to get up to speed faster when using Flyway or another SQL first approach.",1426514388

9211397,comment,9210274,9210274,0,0,jerf,,,"Further insights I got from machine learning:<p>1. There is a mathematically determinable maximum rate of learning. In the real world, this often comes up at small scales, and once you start learning to see the world through a machine learning lens you can see people routinely making enormous leaps off of data that not only doesn&#x27;t support the leap, it literally is mathematically incapable of supporting it. As the amount of data scales up this starts mattering less, and the dominant factor becomes the fact that as humans, we actually aren&#x27;t all that great at pulling learned truth from large amounts of data, though some of this is also that the universe is pretty darned noisy and if we <i>were</i> &quot;good&quot; at it, we&#x27;d learn an awful lot of untrue stuff. (If that sounds like a description of the current reality... no, I mean <i>orders of magnitude</i> moreso than today&#x27;s real science problems.)<p>2. The maximum rate of learning is heavily dependent on two things: The ability of the agent to control input into the environment, and the latency of the feedback. First, it has been well established in both theory (machine learning mathematics) and fact (various psychology experiments with cats in very strange visual environments) that active learning is radically faster than passive learning. Passively sitting in a room and listening to someone attempt to present facts is perhaps not the worst approach to teaching, but it&#x27;s definitely radically suboptimal.<p>Second, latency is <i>huge</i>. Trying to learn from a latent signal is intrinsically harder than a less latent one, and it has absolutely nothing to do with willpower or moral fiber... it is intrinsically, mathematically, irreducibly more difficult. The maximum speed of learning continues to increase all the way down into the sub-second response times.<p>The amount of learning that can even <i>in theory</i> be done under the &quot;listen to a lecture, two days later get quizzed on it, receive marked-up quizzes back a week later&quot; model is <i>shockingly low</i> compared to what is theoretically on the table. If I were in the educational startup field, my near-number-one priority would be <i>speed of feedback</i>. I would literally be happy to hear from one of my programmers that the yes/no feedback on the arithmetic drilling went from .5 to .4 seconds. (If you can get your hands on it, try Big Brain Academy or any of its brethren that have the arithmetic drilling in it, and imagine just how much faster you could have learned basic arithmetic with this incredibly responsive tool around when you were a kid. Reminds me, my oldest is getting near where I ought to be pulling that back out....) Between what&#x27;s on the table with lower latency and integrated spaced repetition, there ought to be almost unbelievable gains on the table for anyone who can put this all together into the right package. (The aforementioned &quot;Big Brain Academy&quot; line of games being the closest I&#x27;ve seen. Latency for putatively &quot;educational&quot; games is often just <i>awful</i>.)<p>On that note, if you are in the educational startup space, it behooves you to take a machine learning course. Whether or not you are able to apply the code techniques themselves, the insights about learning itself will more than pay back your time. And, frankly, I&#x27;m virtually desperate to see someone get this right soon.<p>(On a sidenote, I&#x27;m open to people&#x27;s suggestions about such programs that do take latency into account for elementary school age children. Most real-world programs seem to go in <i>exactly</i> the wrong direction and assume that the children are not discriminating, so who cares anyhow, let&#x27;s not spend money on quality software, and the result is slow, slow, <i>slow</i>... agonizing. My feeling is that if we learn from Big Brain Academy and keep things moving along, the mere act of learning itself can feel good enough to keep most users engaged just fine, and that if you make learning boring, no amount of graphical frippery, loud noises, or encouraging-sounding recorded sound clips of people saying &quot;very good&quot; can make up for it.)",1426514034

So what security benefit would that bring?<p>If you want to protect a legitimate web page from malicious daemons, those measures won&#x27;t help you either: I can simply download your legitimate daemon, extract the TLS private key and generate a valid certificate for www.dropboxlocalhost.com myself - or I just install a custom root CA certificate and use my own private key.\nBut I don&#x27;t think defending against the latter scenario is very useful anyway: Either the &quot;malicious&quot; daemon has been purposefully installed by the user, in which case blocking it would be against user interests, or it is part of a malware.

Wikipedia lists is under you cognates as &quot;Used regardless of the genders of those referred to&quot; (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/You"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/You</a>). In Britain it seems <i>you lot</i> has similar usage. The gender neutrality seems to be well-established in common usage, e.g. see the top answer answer to this ESE questions and the comments (<a href=""http://english.stackexchange.com/questions/11816/is-guy-gender-neutral"" rel=""nofollow"">http://english.stackexchange.com/questions/11816/is-guy-gend...</a>).<p>We should understand that languages change, certain idioms and usages which were a bit objectionable in the past may change in meaning and vice versa. I think <i>you guys</i> represent the former.<p>It may hurt gender-based sensibilities of some but many languages have build in defaults that use the masculine form, a well-known example is French where (from <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender-specific_and_gender-neutral_pronouns"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender-specific_and_gender-neut...</a>):<p>In French: Vos amis sont arrivés — ils étaient en avance (&quot;Your friends have arrived – they were early&quot;). Here the masculine plural pronoun ils is used rather than the feminine elles, unless it is known that all the friends in question are female (in which case the noun would also change to amies and the past participle would change to arrivées).<p>I am always a bit surprised by the emphasis put on gender neutral language, esp. in the US, it is usually pointed that this is sexist and may lead to many of the gender imbalances. Yet other languages where this is is even more prevalent does not seem to place that much emphasis, e.g. French (<a href=""http://french.stackexchange.com/questions/836/given-the-lack-of-a-gender-neutral-pronoun-in-french-how-should-one-refer-to-so"" rel=""nofollow"">http://french.stackexchange.com/questions/836/given-the-lack...</a>). I do not speak French, my question to native speakers is: are there similar efforts in French to rid the language of sexism? According to Wikipedia L’Académie française does not quite support such movements (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender_neutrality_in_languages_with_grammatical_gender#French"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender_neutrality_in_languages_...</a>).",1426512892

Most developers consider it &quot;free&quot;. In practice, it isn&#x27;t. It is entirely possible for the value to exceed the cost, but developers rarely make a sensible decision... they just account the costs as zero and go grab the library, and often don&#x27;t even notice what they&#x27;re paying, and <i>certainly</i> don&#x27;t notice what they&#x27;re costing the team.<p>(Bear in mind we&#x27;re talking &quot;stdlib&quot; vs. &quot;grab a library&quot; here, so NIH-syndrome is not currently on the table.)<p>And you&#x27;re also really prejudicing the discussion, and indeed probably your own mental visualization, by speaking as if every Go program is a budding &quot;command-line catastrophe&quot; waiting to happen, when in fact <i>BY FAR</i> the most common case is that your program takes zero command line parameters, and the <i>vast bulk</i> of the remainder is five or fewer with no complicating factors like &quot;modes&quot; or something.

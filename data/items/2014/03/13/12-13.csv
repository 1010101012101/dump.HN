I&#x27;ll keep this as short as possible...<p>Agile works fine for teams that embrace it. It&#x27;s going to work totally different from team to team. The real point is to find the process that works best for your team to deliver software that meets the customer requirements and budget. Agile for a team of 1 or 3 is not the same as agile for a team of 10 or 100.<p>Agile tends to fail in two places and they are both communication related. First, developers give terrible estimates because of pride. They don&#x27;t think through the problem, they don&#x27;t consider complexity, and they want to look awesome so they ALWAYS over promise and under deliver. That makes them look bad and destroys confidence in the project because it&#x27;s dishonest.<p>Second, managers will take estimates and turn them into deadlines because that is kind of their job and they are doing the best they can with the bad information that developers give them (see bad estimates above). A good PM needs to really push their team for real esteems. Poor estimates lead to poor communication because when things go badly, nobody wants to send up the signal flare for help or tell the boss that the project is not going to hit the deadline. This is often compounded when the client decides to firedrill a feature or bug fix mid sprint, and the manager doesn&#x27;t push back and say that it is going to push everything else back.<p>The best estimates are the ones that are the most honest, not the shortest.<p>Between the bad estimates and the poor communication that comes out of it, there are plenty of times that &quot;Agile&quot; goes wrong, but it&#x27;s not agile&#x27;s fault. It&#x27;s your fault. It&#x27;s your team&#x27;s fault. It doesn&#x27;t work if you aren&#x27;t willing to continuously tweak and reevaluate the process until it fits your situation. That means doing retrospectives and making improvements based on them.<p>Continuous improvement makes agile work. A stagnant process is doomed to failure as requirements and resources change over time.",1394713009

The people who become research doctors working on curing cancer have very, very hard lives, and most aspiring cancer curers never get to do any actual curing.

In fact, for some perverse reason, our society seems to feel that the most trustworthy process for handling real, major problems like cancer research is to erect the highest possible barriers to entry, throw even the survivors out of the field at every least opportunity, and then place absolute trust in the few who survive this winnowing process.<p>The concept that treating everything serious as a tournament-structured winnowing process <i>might</i> have <i>some</i> negative impact on the ability of our research institutions to actually treat and cure cancer does not seem to occur.",1394712806

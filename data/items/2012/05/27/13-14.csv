4030101,comment,4028976,4029265,5,0,T-hawk,,,"Code can be 5% of a business, while the entire software part is a much higher proportion.  The software concern of a business encompasses way more than just coding: testing, environment building and maintenance, source control, backups, security, and much more.  Realizing that the actual executable code is such a small part of delivering a software product is a really important step in maturing from a code-monkey programmer to a capable software engineer.<p>Your watchmaker analogy is actually a pretty close parallel to software.  The mechanical functioning guts (executable code) of the watch, the gears and ratchets and springs and all, probably are about 5% of the business.  But the entire watchmaking concern, from supply of materials to fashioning the face and wristband to final assembly and inspection, encompasses much more.",1338127007

4030095,comment,4029891,4029976,10,0,sp332,,,"Historically, the ""cloud"" was a symbol drawn on network maps to show the part of the network you don't care about. So you'd draw some servers over on one side, and a line going through a cloud to indicate a bunch of routers and stuff, and then the line would go to some clients on the other side.  Your ISP is a ""packet routing as a service"" cloud provider. After a while people started asking, if we can put network routing in the cloud, why not other kinds of computing? So the idea started to take shape: instead of just asking the ""cloud"" to route your packets to servers that would send back computations or stored data, you can ask the cloud for the data directly. Again: the cloud is just the part of the computer/network that you don't have to care about to get your job done.  Google docs: you don't have to care about the disks your data is on. Amazon: you don't have to care about the CPUs your programs run on. None of those are perfect implementations but they're close enough for marketing departments :) A better example is the Kademlia DHT: just throw a hash into the network and you get data back. Much cloudier! :)",1338126802

Totally different industry...but here are a few thoughts that might help you.<p>Interactivity - Right now the site is fairly passive. I think you would produce more engagement with the site if you allowed users to interact with the site. Maybe something like the ability to guess the next song in a quiz type fashion. Then, they get a score they can share across social networks. Or, some kind of voting mechanism that tracks your viewers opinion of the song/video.<p>Personalization - You will have a much greater chance of someone sharing your content across social networks if they can personalize the content and make it say something about themselves. You could think about giving the ability to the users to drag and drop the videos so that it changes the order in which they are played. Then, they might be able to  share it in their social circle and say this is the order they think the songs should fall.<p>I realize these are feature suggestions that might take a significant amount of time, but building in features that drive the marketing is a great way to grow.

4030082,comment,4027851,4028119,2,0,davidlumley,,,"Have been playing for five years.<p>The game itself revolved around PvP. Combat drives the market, which drives production, which creates ships, which get destroyed and so on and so forth. Because of this, EVE has the best economy I've ever seen in an MMO.<p>Solo and small gang PvP is quite fun and what I spent most of my time doing, but some other people enjoy being a small cog in the big machine and flying as part of the large alliances.<p>The two things I find frustrating about EVE are:<p>1) The players. As you lose your ship and anything it had when it gets destroyed people are motivated to win. This results in a large proportion of PvP involving you and your ten friends against one poorly fitted player. For the past few years this has been what the majority of combat has been like. It's certainly possible to win when outnumbered (my corporation Genos Occidere is known for it) but at the end of the day most people like to win and will do whatever they want to - even if that makes the game less fun than it could be.<p>2) CCP are horrible at communicating.<p>CCP, the company which develops the game tend to be very bad at communicating with the player base about issues, or approach things very heavy handedly. Last year there was a large scandal involving micro transactions where the majority of EVE players felt like people were going to be able to pay for an advantage in game. Instead of addressing the concerns, CCP went silent until an email from the CEO was leaked which showed his disconnect with the fan base.<p>Eventually an apology was issued, but many people felt insulted and treated like sheep. Proper communication about what was really happening (small cosmetic transactions) would have made people a lot happier.<p>Similarly, my alliance has been banned from competing in this years ""Alliance Tournament"" despite being last years winners due to poor communication from CCP.<p>At the end of the day EVE is a great game, and there is a lot of depth to it but it is not for everyone. My advice is to get some friends and take a look at the trial, it's enjoyed best when you have people there to help you through the hardships of space.",1338126212

Obat Herbal Jantung Koroner adalah salahsatu Obat herbal yang baik dan aman untuk di konsumsi serta tidak menimbulkan efeksamping dan ketergantungan bagi yang mengkonsumsinya.<p>skilas kita bahas tentang jantung koroner :<p>Penyakit arteri koroner (coronary heart disease) ditandai dengana adanya endapan lemak yang berkumpul di dalam sel yang melapisi dinding suatu arteri koroner dan menymbat aliran darah.\nEndapan lemak (ateroma atau plak) terbentuk secara bertahap dan tersebar di percabangan besar dari kedua arteri koroner utama, yang mengelilingi jantung dan menyediakan darah bagi jantung. Proses pembentukan ateroma disebut ateroklerosis.\nAteroma bisa menonjol ke dalam arteri danmneyebabkan arteri menjadi sempit. Jika ateroma terus membesar, bagian dari ateroma bisa pecah dan masuk ke dalam aliran darah atau bisa terbentuk bekuan darah di dalam permukaan ateroma tersebut.\nSupaya bisa berkontraksi dan memompa secara normal, otot jantung (miokardium) memerlukan pasokan darah yang kaya akan oksigen dari arteri koroner. Jika penyumbatan arteri semakin memburuk, bisa terjadi iskemi (berkurangnya pasokan darah) pada otot jantung, menyebabkan kerusakan jantung.\nPenyebab utama dari iskemi miokardial ada;lah penyakit arteri koroner. Komplikasi utama dari penyekit arteri koroner adalah angina dan serangan jantung (infark miokardial).<p>Obat Herbal Jantung Koroner :<p>Obat jantung Koroner yakni obat herbal Ace Maxs yang terbuat dari perpaduan antara dua herbal yang mempunyai khasiat yang sangat baik untuk pengobatan berbagai penyakit. yakni terbuat dari ektrak kulit manggis yang mengandung zat xanthone, sejenis substansi kimia yang mampu menetralkan radikal bebas yang ada dalam tubuh, tepatnya darah yang berpusat di jantung.

Alpha was originally designed to always lie between zero and one, which for compositing makes sense. For scatterplot colormapping, not so much:<p>If you create a plot with opacity alpha, and which puts N points on top of each other, the remaining 'transparency', that is, the resulting opacity is<p>1 - (1 - alpha)^N<p>This is an exponential, which has the unfortunate feature that it's flat for most of the regime, and then spikes in a relatively short scale. The spike is where we get color differentiation (different opacities get different colors). That's bad: color differentiation should be uniform across the scale.<p>I'm pretty certain Mathematica doesn't do this right either, because it's a pixel-based technique that requires frame buffer manipulation. Instead of rendering with the usual blending operation, you do everything with additive blending, compute the maximum overdraw, and then color-scale linearly.",1338125344

When taxes started rising, IKEA moved to greener pastures, and so did its founder. Ingvar Kamprad has been living in Switzerland since 1976. Guess why. I could go on and pick your list apart piece by piece, but will content myself with your most egregious piece of disinformation: Skype. As any hacker should know, the software was created by Estonians and acquired by the two ""founders"", Friis (a Dane) and Zennstrom (a Swede). They were nowhere near Sweden when any of that happened. They met in Denmark, where Zennstrom had moved to work (he wisely left Sweden even before graduating, did his last year in the US) and were both living in the Netherlands at the time. Last time I checked, Zennstrom, the closest thing to a Swedish Skype connection, lived in London and managed his holdings through holding companies in various low tax jurisdictions, which, needless to say, means not Sweden.",1338125275

4030048,comment,4029632,4029776,3,0,AnthonBerg,,,"Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu is really interesting. Started a training course two weeks ago. It's quite the full-body workout - sore muscles after every session. Core muscles, arms, legs, back. Sparring really makes primal instincts kick in, so there's never a motivation problem. Everyone's exhausted after an hour session, and it's the good kind of exhaustion. Very intense and varied experience. BJJ was explicitly designed to minimize the advantage of larger and heavier opponents, so it revolves around technique to a significant degree. Therefore, sparring with someone way bigger than you is completely different from sparring with someone much lighter; Both are incredibly entertaining. Best session I had was against a female partner, probably 15cm and 15kg lighter. She had a very keen sparring instinct and easily outmanouvered me. Felt the quick intellect behind every move. Amazing experience. Something in it that's missing from the average modern life ...<p>Climbing is the One True Sport for me though. Do try it! The climber's physique is quite attractive and confidence-inspiring. There is a minimum of technique that I hope people will be aware of. I don't want to make it seem complicated though, it isn't.<p>In the climbing process itself, the minimum technique is this: Become efficient. Get a feel for your balance on the wall, make stable triangles on the holds to free the fourth limb to go to the next handhold/foothold, and use larger joints/muscle groups rather than smaller; Most people's instinct tells them to to pull the body up with upper-arm strength, but generally one can keep the arms straight and use legs, waist, torso, or shoulder muscles to gain elevation.<p>And climbing is not a trivial load on the body. One can climb injury-free, but this does require a minimum technique or form. Always warm up, always perform the proper stretches (about 8 main forms of stretches, takes 10 mins or so after practice and really kickstarts the post-exercise well-being). Listen to pain: Usually, pain comes from imbalance in the muscles, or tendons or cartilage not being ready yet. Back slightly off and learn the quite simple exercise designed to put that joint and that muscle group back into balance. Climbing stresses tendons and cartilage, which by nature strengthen and heal slower than muscle.",1338124979

You start thinking: If I can do this with software, I can do it with OTHER STUFF. And then you drift away from code and software entirely, as you realise your new entrepreneurial skills can be put to better use in other areas.<p>It's a huge thing to stop being a programmer, when you started out thinking it was the only path open to you career wise, and that you would be in the software business in one form or another for your entire career.

Thus you get to know what you leave behind and what you get into.<p>* if you try to delete a branch not yet merged into another one (i.e., your changes would be lost), Git warns you and asks to use a different switch (-D rather than -d),<p>* and the last line of defense: in normal configuration, Git stores history of all operations on HEAD (whatever is the current branch) in .git/logs/HEAD. If you remove or lose any branch or changeset you were working on by a mistake, you can easily find it in the log and git-checkout it (or git-cherry-pick or git-merge).<p>At any rate, you can easily push your temporary branch to some other repo once in a while -- to have it thus backed up . You can easily remove it from the other repo once you are done.<p><i>> What if you remove the branch and nobody has any idea where change 'x' came from or why?</i><p>I describe that (the sense of changes) in the commit message.<p>In my experience, branch names are somewhat ephemeral.

It also aims to be modern, with support for networked and multicore computing. Finally, it is intended to be fast: it should take at most a few seconds to build a large executable on a single computer. To meet these goals required addressing a number of linguistic issues: an expressive but lightweight type system; concurrency and garbage collection; rigid dependency specification; and so on.

4030028,comment,4029715,4029863,6,0,dmdeller,,,"> What if you make a mistake and remove a branch that you didn't want to remove?<p>In Git, a branch is just another name, like an alias, for a specific commit. Think of it like DNS, where the branch is the domain name and the commit is the IP address.<p>'quick-fix' => d34db33f<p>When you commit to a branch, it just updates the name to point to the new commit. The new commit points to the old commit, that one points to its previous one, etc., until you reach the beginning. It's a linked list.<p>When you 'delete' a branch, you're just deleting the alias named 'quick-fix'. You're not deleting the commit, d34db33f, or any of the other commits that it points to (assuming that d34db33f is still pointed to by other commits, i.e., you merged it into master or another long-lived branch). You can get it back again at any time:<p>git branch quick-fix d34db33f<p>This will create a new branch named 'quick-fix' that points to the commit d3adb33f - the same commit the previously deleted 'quick-fix' branch was pointing to - which effectively restores the branch exactly as it was before it was deleted.<p>A merge is just like any other commit, except it points to two parent commits instead of one.<p>I usually suggest to new git users that if they're really afraid of losing track of old branches, they can make them into tags after deleting. A tag is really just a read-only branch; it's an alias for a commit that you can't add new commits to. Once the user gets more comfortable with git, they usually don't feel the need to do this any more (since, as above, you can always just get the branch back by looking at the history - in practice, you almost never need to do this).",1338123648

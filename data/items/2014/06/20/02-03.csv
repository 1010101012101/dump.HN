To give their preferred services priority and/or different rates over those offered by competitors or others is something that goes against common carrier principles which seem to imply (to me at least, maybe that&#x27;s wrong) that there are minimum performance guarantees. T-Mobile currently enjoys common carrier status and as such should attempt to emulate a dumb pipe as much as possible lest they get the regulatory eye of Sauron pointed in their direction.<p>I highly doubt they will risk that just for laughs, so likely this is simply a pilot of sorts.",1403232995

However, the way I&#x27;ve most frequently seen the statutes applied has been that 101 is applied broadly -- only used to exclude things like laws of nature -- whereas 102, 103 etc. have been used to judge the actual &quot;quality&quot; of a patent. To me, that also makes technical sense, but as you said downthread, that&#x27;s more a personal aesthetic preference than anything grounded in the actual language on the books.<p>Edit: however, my original point regarding the opinion was, the SC did not just say this fails 101 because it&#x27;s not new, but they went on to say that &quot;long prevalent&quot; practices (i.e. prior art) can make something &quot;abstract&quot;. This, to me, simply makes no sense.",1403229685

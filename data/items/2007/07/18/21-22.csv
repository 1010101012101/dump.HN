If you're going to be cheap and unhealthy, be that way sensibly.",1184795600

35099,comment,35015,35056,0,0,byrneseyeview,,,"""The equity value is not just based on ""here's some money for X cents on the dollar"" X it has to go beyond that.""<p>Uh, no it doesn't. Equity has value, and so does what you get when you give up value. When you're like for like, emotional attachment doesn't make sense.",1184795490
35098,comment,34973,34973,0,0,motoko,,,"Speaking of ""Hungry"":<p>> If you must live on a diet of Lean Cuisine, try the Swedish meatballs.<p>I don't understand this part. Eating healthy isn't much more expensive than eating poorly. Why sacrifice your health and risk your mental abilities by eating crap? That seems like a stupid investment.<p>If you want to cut back on food bills, lose the energy drinks... especially Red Bull. That's my personal experience.<p>Also, fruits, vegetables, breads, nuts... these things can be eaten at your desk while you work.",1184795314

These kind of behaviors will drastically reduce the amount of people that will want to work with you or help you.<p>I work with MDs and PhDs on a daily basis, analyzing their technologies for their start up companies.  By far, I am much more willing to put in extra hours for friendly people than those that cram down my throat how much better they are than me.",1184793284

Allowing dogs at the workplace is a secular decision, viewing them as profane is a religious ones.<p>\nThis argument is without legal grounds. Restaurants serve food that is not kosher, they are not being shut down for discriminating against Jews. Restaurants serve beef, despite offending those of the Hindu faith. Legally these are not grounds for religious discrimination. Neither is allow dogs in the workplace... and other companies have done the same for decades.",1184792591

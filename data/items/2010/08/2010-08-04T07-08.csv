I had a job and I was still at university, while he didn't and had a wife and a newborn daughter, so I thought he was committed enough. I was wrong because he had backing from his parents that are quite wealthy.<p>After some months in which I was the only one that made some work (website design), bringing some money in the company while he was losing time with the excuses like ""I'm  not ready and I don't want to ruin the company reputation (he was the sales guy), he decided that it was better to split our paths. I ""sold"" my part of the company to him and after one year he closed it full of debts.<p>From then on I always found myself in a better position doing things alone. They say that the weight is to much to endure for one single founder, but I don't think so. I was always able to endure everything. If you have friends or relatives or a partner in your life, you are never alone. If you need their support, it does not matter if they are in your venture or not.",1280908684

But the system is designed for everyone.<p>How many people in your class didn't know the capitals? How many couldn't write a formal letter? How many couldn't solve for x? I'm sure majority of HN thought this was trivial, but many others need this, and the only way they can learn it is through repetitive, boring, tedious tasks.<p>It would be more helpful if schooling allowed everyone to excel in whatever they wanted to, but the fact is we still need a basic understanding of everything. Yeah, it's easy to subscribe to the romantic view that doodlers will become great artists, but the fact is being a great artist and knowing differential calculus are mutually exclusive. She has a very black or white view of the educational system. She half expects this magical school system that would transform her into this creative genius if she just demands it loudly. She seems afraid of failure, she doesn't want to work hard for it.<p>If it weren't for these boring tedious tasks, I would've never known about the works of Shakespeare or how cells multiply and many other things I would've never considered studying for, but later found really interesting. The educational system isn't meant to be a one shop stop for your enlightening. It's meant to show you what's possible, what doors you can take. Then you can walk through any door - work on whatever excites you, whatever interests you.",1280908650

It's a fact that people learn more effectively by doing, not sitting in a classroom memorizing and theorizing.  It only makes sense that most information needs to be placed into contexts for it to be any useful whatsoever (or stick in the first place), and school eliminates any context in most cases.  Math is the perfect example of this.<p>Other than for the reason that you may appear ignorant in random social settings with mindless/pointless conversation, why do we have to learn all the math that we do, history, literature, chemistry, biology, etc.?",1280907663

The discoveries possible with 1800-vintage equipment are mostly already made, so now we have to spend orders of magnitude more to learn <i>anything</i> new.

(and the liberals complained... even though it was the most progressive tax cut of my lifetime. Not the whole package, of course, but mailing everyone the same flat three hundred bucks.  For me, that was a pretty small tax cut... but for some people that was almost a 100% tax cut.)  why couldn't that happen again with larger cheques? The republicans are no longer restraining it; naked Keynesisim seems to be the order of the day, at least when the economy is in the toilet.<p>If we see significant deflation, the government /will/ take action to prevent it.  What and how effective that action will be is anybody's guess... my understanding, though, was that Ben Bernanke has mentioned this ability to print money to avoid inflation before.<p>Anyhow... I'm not saying that we will see big inflation, just that it seems quite reasonable for a layman to see a /chance/ that we will have inflation at some point in the near future.  hedging some against that chance, I think, is a rational thing to do.",1280905690

There were times where jails ruled the parties, but now these days are over and Linux has a number of great virtualization solutions like KVM or Xen while there is no much progress on jails.<p>Also, for some reason it's not very popular in enterprise despite of API and ABI stability, i.e. one could hardly find enterprise products like e.g. IBM WebSphere available on FreeBSD. One probably could use Linux ABI support but I'm not sure how reasonable that is.<p>I used to work at ISPs few years back and FreeBSD was very popular in this circles. At one place we had FreeBSD running on absolutely all servers and in other one we had only one RHEL box which was a requirement for some VoIP billing.<p>About two years ago I moved to a software development organization which is quite close to enterprise and virtualization and I've seen 'live' FreeBSD only once and the folks are going to migrate to Linux in the near future (I don't know what their reasons are though). And that's quite sad because I really like FreeBSD.",1280905235

23668,comment,23640,23654,0,0,Xichekolas,,,"Yeah, I figured that might be the reaction, but to use an idea of Warren Buffet's, YC News has a natural competition 'moat' in that it's backed by YC itself... why would you go to another startup news site? Unless Sequoia starts it's own news site, I think YC News is safe. I know I come here because I know the content will be reasonably related to what is going on at YC, not because I think the moderation system is the greatest thing since sliced bread.<p>On the other hand, if it uses the same system as Reddit or something, I could see the reluctance, since Reddit gets to fight it out with a bunch of other sites and doesn't really have a natural monopoly.",1179772288
23667,comment,22959,22959,0,0,orlick,,,"Cool site.  I co-founded a startup that was doing a very similar thing in 2002 (it failed).  Here are some ideas that will hopefully make your site successful.<p>- Start off with a really niche site.  For example: Vegan food in Portland, Oregon.  It's the niches that sites like Citysearch aren't serving very well.<p>- Don't code any more features.  Spend the next 3 months on marketing.  Making this site successful is an exercise in savvy marketing, not programming.<p>- No one cares about keeping track of restaurants they visited.  Everyone cares about going to good restaurants.  Same features, different message.<p><p><p>",1179772271

The 1st ammendment says that freedom of expression cannot be denied. Copyright law says ""ok, temporarily, this expressed idea is off the table, so that the author will make more.""<p>Schultz could sell his copyright for more money, sure. But how does that benefit anyone else? He was already given the right to publicize Snoopy -- a right that not all societies enjoy. In exchange, he would have to realize that his monopoly was short-lived.<p>The way Jefferson saw it, once an idea is expressed, it's not just yours anymore -- it's in my head, too. Obviously you don't own what's in my head. So with copyright laws, we're saying that the 1st ammendment does not apply, temporarily: you may know the song, but you can't sing it, even though we've now taken away your freedom of expression. That can only be short-lived, or we may as well withdraw the 1st ammendment. And it's not as if Schultz created Snoopy in a vacuum; he was influenced by other comic strip artists, and he certainly did not invent the form. Did he owe them money? Did he owe society money for allowing him to blast his drawings out to us without explicit permission?<p>(I've always wanted to say something to Lars from Metallica. During the Napster thing, he said, ""They didn't even <i>ask</i> us. They just took our songs."" To which I'd say, ""yeah, Lars, but you never even asked <i>me</i> before you made your crap songs impossible for me to avoid. If I leave my house, there's your shitty music. And you never even asked."" There are two sides to this coin, and it's remarkably convenient for copyright ""owners"" to forget that.)",1179772252

C++ contains everything in C, and has a lot of handy higher level constructs. You can deal with the specific idiosyncrasies of pure C later, but can get started quickly with C++. <a href=""http://tinyurl.com/26cjz9"" rel=""nofollow"">http://tinyurl.com/26cjz9</a><p>If you don't have any background in programming, or don't really know that you want to learn C or C++ specifically, I would recommend starting with Python. C++ is good if you know that you want to write systems software, or need to interface with C/C++ libraries. If you're just looking to learn to code, then learn Python. kyro said that he enjoyed learning from the free ebook ""How to Think Like a Computer Scientist: Learning with Python"". <a href=""http://www.ibiblio.org/obp/thinkCSpy/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ibiblio.org/obp/thinkCSpy/</a>",1179770877

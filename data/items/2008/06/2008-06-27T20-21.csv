230157,comment,230149,230149,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"Yes, it will make it harder for acquirers to integrate your technology.  But it'll be hard, regardless.  It might even take a near-total rewrite.<p>Then again, you probably don't want to make it easier for an acquirer to negotiate your price down based on more and more aspects of the software that are harder to integrate--there will be some due diligence after the letter of intent is signed, and you'll want them to find that the technology is far better than they'd expected rather than far worse.  I'd suggest pretty strongly making sure everything you do is abstract enough to roll on other platforms without too much pain.  For BigTable, just make sure you don't do anything that won't move to Hadoop+Hbase reasonably easily, for example.  Authentication...abstract it out.  If you support OpenID, too, you'll be able to roll out anywhere.<p>Sure, Google is not evil, but no reason to trust your entire business to a potential competitor or a potential acquirer that might like having that kind of advantage over you in the negotiations.",1214600054

It was a really handy server for testing TLS implementations with big complex certificates. It was also sort of illegal, having both a common name and subject alt. names.

You have billions, you can afford to get a certificate issued for more than a year at a time guys!)<p>Anyway, you should really only be warned in the event of domain name mismatch.

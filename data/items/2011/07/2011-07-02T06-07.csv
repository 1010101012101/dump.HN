2721201,comment,2720937,2720937,3,0,jorangreef,,,"To the developers, are you using this with your own friends? Make it more of a hack for your own use (like your own CB radio or something) and see what happens. At the moment, the copy on the front page does not seem ""real"" enough, like it's written for your friends. It seems more like ""strategy copy"" or something you'd tell a VC. A penny for every ""easiest way"", ""discover"", ""location"", ""around you"".<p>In the interest of reducing sign up friction:<p>1. There's no need for a ""Repeat Password"" field. If a user types the wrong password, they can always use a ""Change Password"" link later.<p>2. Asking for an ""Email Address"" would be better than asking for a ""Username"". You kill two birds with one stone. Most people can remember their email address(es) but I know I don't remember the different usernames I use. Allow users to add multiple email addresses and sign in with any of these.<p>3. Ideally, you could make it that a user only needs to give you their email address to sign up.<p>4. Is ""Sign Up"" really the best copy to use on the first button you want a prospective user to click? What's the information scent there? What's the promise of value? What's the end result of signing up? Be more creative.<p>5. Things like COPPA, privacy policy etc. can go somewhere else.<p>Finally, what's your intention with ShoutFast? What's your motivation? Why are you doing this? Get your motivation right and the methods will follow. Don't worry about getting the methods right or cargo-culting. Just worry that you have the right motivation. Spend your time thinking about motivation and everything else will fall into place.<p>Well done on launching!",1309589823

I have a feeling the IE team is targeting WebKit as their competition and not FF.<p>I haven't liked IE best since IE5, long time Firefox user from Phoenix 0.4, but I'd really suggest trying out IE10, it's pretty much on par with FF4 stock from everything I've seen. I still really don't like that it doesnt handle tab closing properly (IE10), but I see that FF5 finally handles tab closing half way decently.

It probably is already too late to implement my proposed solution anyway. The domain system in place right now has evolved to such a state that the .com domain has a monopoly over the domain system. The .com has been ingrained in the mindset of most internet users as the end-all be-all due to the unrestriction and initial web registration mind share. This is now being taken advantage of by domainers. They purchase thousands of domains, in the hopes of profiting off of a lucky few. Who gets hurt in all of this? The others. John can't get the name for his blog, Amy sees her cake business's name is taken, Kevin has to buy ICantFindADotComDomainNameSoIBoughtThis.ly. Why? Because domainers aren't thinking of the external effects of their actions and just want to make an easy buck for themselves, manipulating the system to their sole benefit. In short, Pure Greed.<p>This supply shortage of decent .com names is only going to get worse as internet usage increases. My hope is, as this continues, that .com domains become of less value and internet users become more comfortable with alternative TLDs.<p>Summary:<p>Domainers are of no help to society.

It unifies things nicely and this approach is one of the reasons why extension development in Chrome can be made so intuitive for people already experienced with web technologies.<p>Regarding the slow performance of FF lately: I remember some months ago I had this situation where I was trying to debug a JS powered upload progress bar I was working on which relied on AJAX calls to update the length of the bar and it just wasn't updating or it would update once, then nothing until the very end when it would shoot to 100%. Watching in Firebug, AJAX calls were being made but seemingly nothing was coming back. I was stumped, I tried everything I could think of, until by chance I tried turning Firebug off and bam! My upload progress bar started working perfectly. JS in Firefox with Firebug on top of it was slow enough that the multiple AJAX calls needed by the upload progress bar weren't working properly anymore.

You might consider that a passion for learning or exploring, which I certainly think you could argue is stronger in some people than in others.  But, nobody is born passionate about a career or profession or job. (And yes, passion contributes mightily to success.  But it doesn't precede success, which was the point of the post.)<p>Having seen a lot of people try to find their passion, it's become pretty clear to me that it takes action.

But I'm serious. It really helps.<p>1) When you learn, say, the C Major chord, make a new card that says ""play the C Major"", with the answer being the fingering chart for that chord. It will then keep track of how well you remember that chord and ask you to play it less often as you get better and better at remembering it.<p>2) When you learn to play a particular song, set up a card to remind you to play it. The answer to this one should probably just list what book + page number to find the song. (That's just for the early stage when you might not remember it at all.)<p>3) Finally, set up a Seinfield chain ( <a href=""http://lifehacker.com/281626/jerry-seinfelds-productivity-secret"" rel=""nofollow"">http://lifehacker.com/281626/jerry-seinfelds-productivity-se...</a> ) for the task ""practice my guitar"" where the task is simply to work through the guitar flashcards for the day (there's often surprisingly few of them).  \n<a href=""http://www.joesgoals.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.joesgoals.com/</a> is a particularly good tool for something like this.<p>Good luck with your foray into the world of music.

1050110,comment,1049961,1050074,0,0,prosa,,,"That is a reasonable argument. (You'd make a great banker!) However, realize that in today's world the message coming from banks is spend-spend-spend.<p>Furthermore, a huge amount of overdraft fees comes from the practice of auto-enrollment in overdraft protection. If consumers need education, having transactions go through at the point-of-sale despite having an empty bank account is a recipe for trouble.<p>Last, is the issue of check ordering.  (Considered a ""courtesy"" by most banks!)  Today, most banks clear all debit card purchases (and checks) at the end of the day, after sorting them from largest to smallest.  The idea is to run your account into the red as quickly as possible, saving the small $1-5 charges for the end.  This simple greedy algorithm (no pun intended) maximizes the number of overdrafts.  The typical rationale is ""big checks tend to be rent and other important payments, which you would prefer to clear under any circumstance"" -- laughable when the majority of overdrafts are on small, card-based debits.<p>So while I agree with you that consumer behavior needs to change, the people that need to save and not spend are exactly the ones that banks are (intentionally) targeting, and they have gotten exceedingly good at doing so.  Check order policies and automatic enrollment in OD protection only complicate the issue.",1263390520

1050108,comment,1049961,1049961,0,0,zoba,,,"I feel like there is a lot my bank could be doing but isn't.  Most of it relates to technology.<p>First, I think a decent web interface for my money would be nice.  The bank wont let me have 20 checking accounts, but it would be nice if I could have the appearance of that many accounts in a web interface.  One account for bills, one account for the new computer I want to buy, one account for food, one account for random transactions (i.e. where my debit card pulls from).  Then, when my direct deposit paycheck comes in, I want to be able to have it automatically be split up into these bins.  I do all of this mentally any way, but if I could see it on screen then it would make things much easier.<p>I also want there to be text message alerts for things, especially overdraft.  I got $720 in over draft fees for spending something like $150 last fall, this is absurd!  If they had sent me a text message or email, or anything I wouldn't have had to skimp on Christmas presents.  Of course many will say ""this is how they make their money: fees.""  I would reply, ""this is capitalism: have a better service and make your competitors bend to your will, or let them go bankrupt.""<p>I have come up with other ideas on what a bank could do, and would like to be updated if anything happens with this.",1263390473
1050106,comment,1049895,1049895,0,0,tedunangst,,,"I tried.  No, really, I tried.  Back when the whole etherpad is dead thing happened, I spent about a weekend trying to write a clone in Erlang.  Erlang seemed a perfect fit for a comety backend server.<p>First off, I found info saying that yaws wouldn't work because it has hard coded timeouts.  Then I found erlycomet.  But none of the samples worked.<p>Moving on, I found nitrogen.  This was the one true diamond in the rough.  It works, it has real documentation, and it's pretty well designed, at least according to my one day experience in erlang land.<p>Side note here that both these projects use mochiweb, which is like the new hotness apparently.  But documentation for mochiweb?  Ha, forget about it.<p>Once I got the basic page up, I decided to go with couchDB for a backend.  You'd think that with couchdb also being written in erlang, there'd be some good client libraries, but the situation is pretty much a clusterfuck.  erlang_couchdb was the best I found, except none of the examples in the README actually worked.  And there's not much in the way of documentation.  The main problems stemmed from there being different ideas of what should represent a document.  Some functions used a pattern like {json, { wawawa }} others used a pattern more like [{json, [wawawa]}] and so on and so forth.  The document get and put operations used different forms!  put(get) crashed!<p>Primary conclusions I drew:<p>1.  erlang web development is just too immature yet.  Half the libraries you need are just random code dumps in github or google code.  There's piles and piles of blogs and articles like this that tell you all the choices, but don't do much to explain why you'd want one or the other.  Piecing it all together is very frustrating.<p>2.  erlang as a language has the lethal combination of dynamic pattern matching.  Pattern matching in a static language like ocaml?  Awesome.  Dynamic types in language like python/lua?  Qualified awesome.  Those features together?  MOST ANNOYING THING EVER.  Everytime my app (and by my app, I mean the example code I was running) crashed with a ""oops, I didn't find the right pattern"" error, it was unfuckingpossible to determine who/what/why was at fault.<p>It's not the syntax or the functionalness or the strangeness of erlang that killed me.  It was dynamic pattern matching and the difficulty of figuring out what went wrong.  I'm avoiding it like the plague from now on.",1263390433

There were some quite prominent columnists who insisted that the North was misunderstood, that they weren't committed to continuing to develop weapons, and that the various tactics used by both administrations were really what was at the root of the North's belligerence.<p>Sometimes pleas for perspective can be good, and sometimes they can all be so much noise. I'm not going to characterize this piece, but I'll note that there is a great similarity between how NK was covered with nukes and how China is being covered with CyberWarfare.<p>I find it disconcerting.",1263389083

These fees are almost entirely driven from checking behavior of Americans earning less than $50K a year.  You would be shocked at how frequently overdrafts occur for a customer with a low balance.  These fees can add up to hundreds of dollars a year on average for low balance customers.  In fact, they are among the primary reasons why ""Free Checking"" is an attractive offer for big banks.  (Hint: it ain't really free.)<p>There is serious congressional concern about the inherently predatory nature of overdraft fees.  However, with Dodd's impending departure from the Senate it appears that the banking lobby will prevail in avoiding legislative restrictions.",1263389048

1050048,comment,1049961,1049961,0,0,imajes,,,"This is cute. I like the tenacity of what you're doing here.<p>Thing is, it's entirely impossible. To start a bank you need capital to leverage your deposits. That's anything from 10-30%, so to have a liability of $1000 you'll need $300  in capital reserves just to keep within the rules. Then there's the insurance you'll need to buy on the risk you take, and the other ways you'll need to turn profit - otherwise, why will i invest in you (with retail deposits?)<p>As jacques said, credit unions are a simpler step- but even simpler are lending groups where everyone pitches in money and then everyone takes a turn in being able to borrow from the pool. I can't quite recall the name of these structures, but they are on wikipedia- NPR's Planet Money podcast covered them a few months ago. (which, if you are in any way interested in this stuff, you should listen to back-to-front).<p>But i don't think it's the banking that's the problem.<p>If you have a bunch of money - liquidity - then it's easy to move it around to ensure you're covered. Then you don't get hit by charges. In fact, most systems (wells fargo included) do this by default now, and you don't even have to care. You can realize then that cashflow is the lifeblood of small biz, and if you have it, everything is great. If you don't, you're screwed.<p>The bottom line might seem to be that it's hard to be financially stable when you're starting out/contracting/consulting/low paycheck, whatever. There are two ways of dealing with this: making a strict budget and keeping to it (boring) or deferring your care till you make enough money to just buy that debt off - in which you risk bankruptcy and other nasty things.",1263388502

If you don't want to worry about overdrafts, check your balance in the morning, write down the amount, and don't spend more than that. Or pay for everything in cash from an ATM and use the ATM to double-check the balance first.<p>As for the $26 overdraft charge, do you know how much it costs the bank? Do you know that it makes a difference if it's only a $1 overdraft? If you don't know the industry, how can you propose to change it?

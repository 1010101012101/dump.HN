The effective recovery time was insane, and not to mention the pain/temporary disability (also insane). An inpatient stay wasn't even offered, but in hindsight it shouldn't have even been optional.<p>By contrast, an unrelated abdominal surgery a few years later, despite being a much more involved procedure, had a much faster recovery.

I obviously exaggerate the incompetence of such implants. However, let's look at this way. Let's say that I'm an 8/10 for the role (9/10 is where I'm headed, 10/10 is best in the world). No VC is going to risk his investment on a 3/10; that's a 5-point drop. But a 7? A 6 whom he owes a really big favor? A 5 who he seems to think is a 9 because of the 5's superior social skills? Quite likely, yes. The VC would rather have a personal friend at 7-level competence than me at 8. And while 8's and 9's are really rare, 6's and 7's aren't uncommon, and the VC has plenty of 5+ in his network.<p>I know that I'm really solid at a lot of things. I also know that, while my level of talent may be rare and high, ""close enough"" is not rare for most purposes. I can't afford to kid myself and underestimate the competition. And to be frank about it, there are a lot of roles in which a 6 and an 8 are interchangeable.<p><i>The fact is that often the lead developer who builds the first version of a product does not have the skills and experience to be the CTO as the company grows. The first salesperson may well not be ready to build a sales team. The accountant might not have the breadth to be a CFO.</i><p>I'm sure that's true, taking a pragmatic approach, but I also think that's often used as an excuse to throw people under the bus.<p>Often, the short-term compromises and stress levels cause a situation where good people end up ineligible for the top roles. The guy who pissed off 2/5 of the team by pushing what turned out to be the right decision has too many enemies to be CTO, and the person who built the original system under extreme time pressure is ineligible for VP/Eng because the system is starting to strain.<p>That happens, and some of it's inevitable, but if someone's going to be hired above me, I want it to be <i>with</i> my consent and voluntary abdication. I'll gladly step down if it's the right thing to do; but I prefer having a say in how it happens. Otherwise, you might as well just fire me.",1370357872

(To the extent that you think you can find a private company that can and does use coercion, I object to that too.)<p>Even as a liberatarian, I'm happy to say some things are well worth the coercion. But it should <i>never be forgotten</i>, because otherwise people <i>do</i> start thinking it's just free money that has no other concerns whatsoever, and start spending it stupidly. We know this by simply looking around at political discourse, to the point that I almost wonder if you're dissembling when you claim that nobody thinks this way. Look harder. We should never forget that social spending is a cost/benefit question that never has zero costs.<p>I actually personally find it a bit bizarre that people find this an objectionable statement. Realizing that money is not free and should be spent on worthwhile things to account for the coercion should lead to <i>better</i> spending. Defending the proposition that we shouldn't be so concerned about the costs is a recipe for producing less efficient spending, as always happens when costs are misjudged. The fact that this sort of thing has been politicized ought to lead you to wonder who is politicizing it, and what they're hiding behind it.",1370357779

Control over who you associate with and what you pay attention to. What can you do with TV or a newspaper? Turn them off or throw them away; at best you can scan through them while trying to avoid content (including ads) not relevant to you.<p>There are other alternatives though; take HN for example. It's not unfiltered, but it definitely gives you more (and most likely more relevant to your interests) stories. Aggregators such as HN, ./, et. al have been <i>far</i> superior to anything I've ever experienced from TV or newsprint. Much more relevant, much more in depth, much more accurate (not a high bar to beat), and most importantly, filtered to <i>my</i> interests (who gives two sh<i>ts about the Hiltons or the Kardashians?).

Sorry, but if I wanted to work at a company where people could be hired above me without me having a say in it, I'd take the $200k+ hedge fund job and wouldn't touch your startup with my worst enemy's dick. This is how talent sees it. Accept it or fail at your own peril.<p>Job titles don't matter for fuck-all early on, but companies tend to have a weird dynamic. For a long time, titles don't matter and they're <i>so</i> inconsequential that they're never used (business cards are blank on the title line). Sure, someone might be ""Chief Revenue Officer"" but the only people who even know he has that title are the CEO and Board. When titles are inconsequential, you hurt yourself by bringing them up. So don't. The title is something you have, for later on when you need it, but not something you use-- at all. It just sits there for later purposes.<p>So, in the early stages, while it's important to <i>have</i> titles, I will agree that you shouldn't explicitly ""use"" them much. For a 10-person startup, they don't mean <i>anything</i>, operationally, except for where a person will be when they start to mean something. Through this, they motivate talented people to stick with the company even when things get painful.<p>And then... the company gets to a point where titles <i>do</i> matter and, by that time, I better fucking have one. Unless you can convince me that your company will <i>never</i> have job titles, in which case I don't want to be ""that guy"" who brings them into existence.<p>OP seems to support the idea of an early employee taking a pre-emptive hit (""Engineering Director"" instead of ""VP/Engineering"" or ""CTO"") so other people can be plugged above him, often without his consent. This is because the real perk of being a VC is being able to hand out executive positions in other peoples' companies to your underachieving friends. Fuck that. That's bullshit.

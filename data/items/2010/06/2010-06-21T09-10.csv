1448358,comment,1448338,1448342,0,0,_delirium,,,"Hmm, I guess my understanding of hacker norms, at least in the communities I've been in for some years, was that there was no particular requirement to ask permission before building derivative versions of stuff, and generally you should assume it's allowed and encouraged, though credit is appropriate (and generally more prominent credit than this asciimo site gave). There's a half-dozen or so Hacker News repackagings that never asked pg's permission before going live, for example (e.g. <a href=""http://hacker-newspaper.gilesb.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://hacker-newspaper.gilesb.com/</a>).<p>So I'd definitely agree credit was poorly given, and this guy's motives probably aren't good either, but ""code theft"" seems a bit silly.

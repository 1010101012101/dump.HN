Not necessarily the BEST USE of time at a given moment, but dedicate some time to refresh the code with better tools, better syntax, better libraries, etc is a excellent way to move forward.<p>For a related sample, with obj-c I move to ARC ASAP, and plan to introduce the syntax literals as soon as possible. I certainly move the whole app codebase to python if exist a cheap way -and still 100% interface compatible to the coccoa-api - as like move js->coffescript for sure!<p>Is masochist persist in a old way just because is harder. Like when some refuse to upgrade the same language codebase to improve things (for example, I will move to LINQ, Lambdas, parallel code, async in C# as I move along) <i>IF</i> the change provide some advantage - reducing lines, better API, more performance, better clarity, etc -<p>I tough constant -but careful- refactoring of a live project is very healthy.<p>Is better doing it when the project is moving, that wait until a major event happend in the industry -like what happend to my competitors, still on .NET 1 / VB Classic- and suddenly, your move is damm hard, too costly, and you have no skills in the ""new thing"".<p>I certainly think something that replace or massively fix JS (including, a better JS) will be very usefull.<p>If is ok to move from inline styles to CSS, and from HTML to HTML5, then move from JS with issues related from years of hacking-along-design to anything else, like CS, is a good effort.",1347577125

I used to be shy also, but for different reasons (I stuttered pretty badly when I as young). I can say for certain that opening up and truly connecting with people makes a big difference in life satisfaction.<p>If you haven't read it, a good starting point is Dale Carnegie's classic 'How to Win Friends & Influence People"".<p>Beyond that, take small steps to connect with people. Here is a first big step IMHO: start smiling more and projecting happiness. It attracts people to you. Even more, psychologists have found reason to believe the act of physically smiling improves your mood. Fake it til you make it.<p>Here are a few others: start making eye contact with people on the street, smile at people on the street, start saying hi to random people (the waitress, the person working the cash register, co workers), make random small talk with strangers (about anything! you have nothing to lose really), etc.<p>All the small steps will slowly add up, and over time, you will find yourself connecting better with people, making  more friends, etc.<p>Good luck!",1347576530

Some parts of CLOS (method interceptors) have also made it to Java in forms of AOP (and in fact the author of AspectJ is one of the authors of CLOS) -- which provides ""magic"" for Java frameworks such as Guice.<p>While I also hate to Biblethump, but Alan Kay has also spoken very favourably of CLOS despite CLOS not being message passing. If you prefer, you can think of CLOS as a ""meta OO"" which lets you implement different OO behaviour including message passing.<p>Back to Clojure deftype and defrecord do provide encapsulation, by the way: in types with :mutable-unsyncyronized fields can <i>only</i> be accessed via self/this pointer.<p>I do agree that Clojure's protocols/multimethods aren't a full blown CLOS, but they could (sensibly) be called a form of OO (even if it's a form OO that differs greatly from Java and C++)",1347576287

4519024,comment,4518954,4518954,3,0,kls,,,"The life of a developer goes through several phases, generally over-engineering is one of them, then generally comes clever, many times developers never get past clever and start to confuse it with elegance, but clever code is not by itself elegant, the mark of elegance is simplicity, when code is simple it becomes elegant, when it is simple and clever it is elegant. But if you have to choose between one or the other choose simplicity. Code that even a novice can see the beauty in the simplicity of it (and understand it) is where true elegance lies. It takes a true craftsman to take something complex and make it simple. That it what we do every day, we take complex processes and simplify them via automation and association. When one realizes the same principle applies to the development of their code, they then start down the path of writing truly elegant code.<p>Simple code is decoupled, simple code does not have tight dependencies, simple code is well organized and simple code does not rely on too much abstraction. If you strive to achieve those few things you will be a better developer than a significant portion of your peers.<p>decoupling code allows you the ability to extend the system without having to go back and modify existing code.<p>Avoiding as many tight dependencies as possible allows you to change portions of the code base without having the ramifications of those changes leak out into other areas.<p>Well organized code allows new developers to find what they are looking for, it helps document itself. Part of good organization is adhering to standards and best practices.<p>Relying too much on abstraction means that you can't see a complete picture of the code without understanding multiple layers. Abstraction, when used properly, allows you to reuse code which is a good thing, but it comes at a cost, it sacrifices conceptualization. Too much abstraction and the system or a portion of it cannot be easily conceptualized in the mind. It also creates tight dependency among components that sit on top of abstracted layers. It should not be avoided, but no problem can be abstracted away, if the code in question cannot be reused there is no reason to abstract it, rather componentize it into discreet blocks, so that it can be conceptualized as a black box.",1347575889

I don't think the fact that stimulants... stimulate is controversial: it's just side effects of stimulants are also well known. Of course, some stimulants are more socially accepted than others: no one calls me a junky and an addict, even though I run to the coffee machine every morning lest I experience (non-trivial) withdrawal syndroms (headache, excessive sleepiness).<p>Racetams appeal as they (seem to) have no known side effects -- which is that part that sounds too good to be true. As far as I understand the mechanism is such: poor absorption of choline (either due to lack of choline in diet or issues with choline receptors) creates cognitive impairment; racetams and choline ""fix"" this impairment. That isn't controversial.<p>However, what I don't know (and what tokenadult doesn't know) is what affect racetams and choline have on healthy individuals. In other words, is the money spent on months' supply of choline and *racetam simply better spent on French press, a good grinder, dark roasted beans, and a gym membership?<p>I don't know and I'm curious to see some studies. Note: I am not saying that folks shouldn't experiment with racetams, it's just they can't know a-priori it will have the advertised effect. OTOH if you are not short on money, there's nothing wrong with experimentation: the Placebo effect alone could be worth it. It's just you have to draw the line between ""someone on the Internet reported did X and experienced Y"" and ""X implies Y is a scientific valid conclusion"".<p>Of course the worst scam is energy drinks: a cup of coffee costs less and tastes better than five hour energy -- and I am at a loss at how a five hour energy could do something that coffee can not.",1347575225

You use it to run the JIT compiler and have Windows cache the output so that it can be reused instead of regenerated every time the program is run. Compared to a real AOT, it has several technical limitations, including:<p>1. You can't distribute native code. The usual workflow is that you deploy bytecode assemblies, and run ngen during installation to get the machine code into the local machine's native image cache.<p>2. You're still dealing with a two-phase compilation.  This implications for what kinds of compiler optimizations are possible.<p>3. For the paranoid, having to still distribute bytecode means that your binaries are still easy to decompile.<p>On the other hand, it also has some technical advantages. Generating machine code on the client machine makes more processor-specific optimizations possible, for example.

If I recall correctly, switching a bit will cost at least ln(2)kT energy, or about 3<i>10^-21 joules at room temperature. According to Wikipedia[1], FM signals are minimally 10^-18 watt. If we have about a hundred antennas and assume a somewhat larger signal strength, we could thus viably use 10^-15 watt. Sadly, that will only allow us to switch 400000 bits per second[2], not nearly enough for any meaningful computation, let alone communication. Notice that I'm not talking about storing a few hundred thousand bits, I'm talking about switching them from 0 to 1 or vice versa. Adding two numbers will probably switch dozens of bits. And that is with equipment operating at the limit of what is possible by the laws of physics. So likely we'll end up a few factors thousand lower. A few hundreds of bits per second is probably enough for some RFID like system, but not for anything useful.<p>1: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orders_of_magnitude_(power)#attowatt_.2810.E2.88.9218_watt.29"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orders_of_magnitude_(power)#att...</a>\n2: <a href=""http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=1+bit+%2F+%28ln%282%29+*+boltzmann+constant+*+300K+%2F+%2810%5E-15+watt%29%29"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=1+bit+%2F+%28ln%282%29+...</a>",1347573923

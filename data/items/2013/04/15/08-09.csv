An implicitly deflationary currency comes at a cost, and that cost is the entire economy based on that currency. It stifles growth and activity compared to an implicitly inflationary currency. Which costs the individual a little over the short-term but benefits the entire economy as a whole. The end result being that economic growth spurred by the activity of people trying to avoid loss due to inflation more than makes up for that loss.<p>In the time since 1950 the US dollar has inflated by a whopping 840% (a factor of 9.4x), but the per capita GDP has grown by an even more impressive 3200% (a factor of 33x in nominal dollars), or 250% in inflation adjusted dollars.",1366015881

I'm in grad school, and the inability to focus is becoming a huge problem.  It takes so much work to get <i>into</i> something.  On rare occasion, I'll be able to get into what I'm working on and then I can focus non-stop for 10-12 hours, but it's near impossible to just sit down and get 30 minutes of work done on something.  Even those 10 hour sessions require an hour or two to get started.<p>I am looking for advice beyond the normal ""minimize distractions"".  My best attempt has been to go into a plain, featureless room without windows and use a software program that blocks any time-wasting internet site.  But I just end up staring at the wall, thinking about other things instead.  Or if I start reading a textbook, I'll just fall asleep or read the same line over and over again.<p>I'm not sure exactly what the cause of this is.  The bad thing is that the stuff I need to work on is mostly things I'm really interested in (research) although some of it I am not so interested in (classwork).  It's very frustrating, and it doesn't feel like it falls in the ""normal"" range of focus issues anymore.  I'm quite certain it's not ADD, because I didn't really have this problem when I was younger.<p>Any help would be greatly appreciated.

5550316,comment,5548976,5549891,1,0,tzs,,,"> Yeah, who guessed that federally incentivized lending would make the cost of something go up?<p>I have not seen any convincing data to support the idea that this had anything to do with college costs increases. Looking at tuition costs at top private schools, costs have risen pretty steadily for at least the last 90 years. I didn't see any obvious difference between pre and post Federal loan program eras.<p>(I looked at private schools because public schools are often highly influenced by what is going on in their state government. For instance, if a state is having a budget shortfall, one of the things they often due is cut college funding, and the colleges make that up with tuition increases).<p>People who assume that Federal loans are responsible for high college costs seem to be assuming that college costs follow ""normal"" market rules. That is a questionable assumption, for if the college marked did follow those rules, then college costs would actually be much higher than they are now. Good colleges turn away students, and so if they were in a ""normal"" market, they would be raising prices to the point where they are just able to fill their seats.",1366012986

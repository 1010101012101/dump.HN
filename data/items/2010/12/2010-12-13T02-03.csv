Lisp is a programming language. Microsoft has other products in the category of programming languages. The ones it has pushed — Visual Basic, C# and (to a lesser degree, since it's NIH) C++ — have all been tremendously successful. This is because Microsoft has a monopoly on Windows dev tools and APIs that it can exploit to get developers using things. This monopoly is less useful for pushing Zunes.<p>And to try and argue that Java is unsuccessful because it isn't used in set-top boxes? I don't even know what to say to that. The fact that Java's successes were in other domains than the one you hand-picked for your comparison does not somehow make them disappear. You may as well say that C was never very popular because no Ruby on Rails apps were ever written in it.<p>The fact is that Lisp has not had any major backers since the AI craze fizzled out. If a Lisp had received the same kind of support as Java, C#, Objective-C or JavaScript, the language landscape might very well look quite different.",1292208820

1998940,comment,1998574,1998574,0,0,Mz,,,"In my teens, I had a boatload of academic awards.  There was a lot of social expectation (pressure) in terms of me Being Somebody Someday.  I passed on a status-y scholarship, dropped out of college, and did the wife and homemaker thing for a couple of decades.<p>As a teen, I fixed my dad's back.  He had been bedridden for short periods about every other year due to his back problems. When I was 17, he was so bad, for the first time ever he was unable to make it to the bathroom a few feet from his bed.  They got him a bedpan. I spent 2 weeks using intensive gymnastics stretching techniques to get him back in normal range of motion, modified the doctor prescribed exercise sheet, and spent 6 months doing daily massage.  He threw out the ""corrective shoes"" they had prescribed. His back problems never came back.<p>With that experience, I seriously considered going in to medicine.  At 17, while filling out my college applications, I had two majors I was considering:  Physical Therapy or Geology.  I interviewed an actual physical therapist and discovered it wasn't what I was envisioning.  So I put down Geology for my desired major.<p>Years later, I enrolled in an environmental studies program.  In many colleges, such programs grew out of the Geology department or something closely related.  And then I had a major health crisis and spent a year at death's door. Doctor's told me ""People like you don't get well"".  I've been getting well for some time now -- which I don't think would be possible had I gotten some kind of medical degree because I would have the same training and thinking of the people who claim I can't get well.<p>So, I've done something pretty amazing.  And it mostly isn't welcome news in online communities for folks with my condition.  I get accused of being a liar, a charlatan and a snake-oil salesman.<p>I don't know if I want to Make My Mark.  I don't feel I have anything to prove to anyone.  I didn't get well to impress anyone.  There is apparently no money in trying to help others who are suffering horribly and dying.  There is not only no money but I get routinely kicked in the teeth and very few people are at all interested, so all this crap isn't even accomplishing anything.  So I spend a lot of time wondering if I should bother to keep trying to find a way to more effectively share information about how I got well or if I should just leave these hostile people to their dire fate while I go off to make money rather than my mark.<p>I don't have any answers.  I wish you well in your journey.",1292206452

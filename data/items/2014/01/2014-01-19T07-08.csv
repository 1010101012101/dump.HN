Or about a million other things.<p>And it&#x27;s funny Chrome is trying to prevent apps from doing that, when they themselves do the same thing: In Windows, pinning to the taskbar is supposed to be user-only. But Chrome circumvents that and pins anyways, actively avoiding user preference. (And they drop an icon on the desktop, without asking.)",1390118347

An app which is not just some behavior added to that core architecture is not capable of becoming a part of the web. It&#x27;s a ghetto of single-purpose data, exactly like the client/server apps from the 1980s, only this time with a deployment model that gets it past gatekeepers in IT. It shouldn&#x27;t be called a &quot;web app&quot; simply because its installer is delivered via HTTP, and people working on such projects ought to be aware that the network they&#x27;re building is <i>competing</i> with the web for content while being far more hostile to hacking and mashups.",1390118056

7083763,comment,7083512,7083666,29,0,hdevalence,,,"I was referring more to isolation in two related senses:<p>1. A technical sense: Canonical has a significant amount of distribution-specific software that has very little adoption outside of the Ubuntu ecosystem. Examples include:<p>* their own version control system, bzr (which I think has now been essentially abandoned in terms of development, and other than a few GNU projects never saw much uptake at all);<p>* their own desktop shell, Unity, which to the best of my knowledge has never been properly packaged for any non-Ubuntu distribution; their own display server, Mir, whose development is the subject of much controversy, and which has been rejected for well-founded technical reasons that have probably already been discussed at length on HN;<p>* their own init system, Upstart, which was initially adopted by other distributions, who then abandoned it in favour of systemd due to its fundamentally flawed design (for instance, there is no way to 100% reliably keep track of a process&#x27;s children and the dependency resolution runs backwards, meaning that some configurations can cause hangs).<p>2. A social sense: Canonical&#x27;s relationship with the rest of the Linux ecosystem has soured (beginning, in my opinion, around 2009-2010, but as a gradual thing, it&#x27;s hard to pin down) to the point of outright hostility. In my opinion, most of the responsibility for this lies with Canonical&#x27;s poor communication with others. There&#x27;s a very detailed history of some events from 2009-2011 that you can read here [1] detailing their relationship with GNOME.<p>The culmination this year has been disgraceful personal attacks by Mark Shuttleworth on people who raise technical criticism of Canonical&#x27;s software. I expect that more will follow whatever the fallout of Debian&#x27;s systemd decision is.<p>The two are obviously related. The big problem is that there&#x27;s (again, in my opinion) very little community appetite for contributing to Canonical&#x27;s software. And why would there be, given that in order to submit patches for Ubuntu Touch, I need to give Canonical permission to relicence my code under any proprietary licence they choose? At that point, it&#x27;s not a community contribution, it&#x27;s just working for Mark Shuttleworth for free.<p>Does Canonical have the software engineering capability to maintain a bunch of stuff (an init system, a display server) that&#x27;s really unrelated to their problem (making awesome products for users) and still be able to take on Android at the same time? I don&#x27;t think so.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://bethesignal.org/blog/2011/03/12/relationship-between-canonical-gnome/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://bethesignal.org/blog/2011/03/12/relationship-between-...</a>",1390117351

I&#x27;ve been reading Egor&#x27;s blog for a while now, and it just gets better and better, and I think the writing is getting much easier to follow as well.<p>But I do wish someone would start writing a &quot;super-verbose-homakov.blogspot.com&quot;. I can see the magic, but I&#x27;d love just a bit more hand-holding, and discussion about detecting your own versions of these types of bugs, and proper layers of mitigation.<p>0) The &#x27;name=...&#x27; payload...<p>- is the &#x27;SID&#x27; literal, or is that replaced by a real session id? (see below)\n- the <a href=""https://"" rel=""nofollow"">https://</a> url, assume that came from MtGox when creating the payment button?\n- &#x27;payment[cancel]=cancel&#x27; : assume egor had to figure out to put that there? how did he figure that out? what is happening by putting that there?<p>1) Setting cancel URL to javascript:eval(name)<p>- so do you fix this exploit by blacklisting this kind of cancel URL?\n- would a blacklist even work reliably?\n- can you protect window.name anyhow?\n- just like innerText prevents XSS for display strings, is there an equivalent we can use for URLs to know they are inert?<p>2) Put your payload in window.name and redirect to..<p>- if I google &quot;window.name xss payload&quot; there are plenty of links\n- like this gem from 2008: <a href=""https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=444222"" rel=""nofollow"">https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=444222</a>\n- I can understand this technique could work in an iframe, how does this work across a redirect?\n- does it matter how exactly the redirect is triggered?<p>3) User is supposed to wait 5 seconds..<p>- I have no idea what this is telling me, is this some MtGox implementation quirk?\n- Maybe user is checking out from attacker&#x27;s site using the payment button and this is a timeout during checkout?<p>4a) Get some guest SID with server side...<p>- server side, as in server hosting the page with the checkout button?\n- the point here is you need a valid SID to insert into the payload in place of &#x27;SID&#x27;?\n- assume you have to keep it valid, fixating to an expired session is useless, right?\n- if mtgox doesn&#x27;t allow a session to float between ip/user-agent, it&#x27;s not perfect (e.g. Wi-fi hotspot, spoof agent of victim) so is it worth storing that data with your session IDs and expiring if it ever doesn&#x27;t match?<p>4b) our cookie shadows original SESSION_ID because more specific Path-s are sent first<p>- &quot;shadows&quot; is a great way to describe this, like that term!\n- does fixation always use shadowing? can you fixate with other techniques?\n- does shadowing always mean multiple copies of the same cookie are sent?\n- should servers be looking for unexpected duplicate cookies sent from the client in each request?\n- if the cookie also had a signature (server-side HMAC, secret key), would that definitely prevent shadowing?<p>5) Close the window.<p>- Huh?<p>6a) Someday user logs in<p>- Logs into what, Gox?\n- They have to come from your malicious page, right, for window.name payload to be there?\n- So should this say, someday user tries to buy your alpaca socks?<p>6b) Your server script should run cron task every 5 minutes, checking if SID is still &quot;guest&quot;<p>- in other words, checking with the fixated SID if mtGox thinks you are logged in?\n- also probably updating your window.name payload as session times out and such?<p>7) Describe how mt.gox fixed it and how you would have fixed it?<p>Another thought, if the victim was already logged into Gox when they click your checkout button, their cookie is changing to your guest SID, so they get logged out. Probably only 1 in 1000 would even raise an eyebrow though.<p>Oh, signing doesn&#x27;t matter because of course attacker is grabbing a perfectly valid and signed cookie from you in the first place.",1390116092

7083721,comment,7083109,7083547,11,0,mekoka,,,"> tl,dr: this encourages single-page apps which will be the death of the web.<p>The first sentence of the &quot;Web Apps&quot; section is <i>Web ap\u00ADpli\u00ADca\u00ADtions are not doc\u00ADu\u00ADments</i>. This is a motto that I believe a lot of people who think the way you do should take pause and reflect upon.<p>After years producing web apps, I came to the conclusion that non-js web apps are some of the craziest ideas ever. The browser without js is a tool to consume and, to some very minimal extent, produce documents. I consider most non-js apps on the browser to be huge hacks at best, that do what they can to circumvent the shortcomings of that technology. And heaven knows that shortcomings are a dime a dozen (lack of http method on anchors, limited to GET and POST, to only name a few).<p>If you do embrace building apps with js, then you need to stop thinking in the document-oriented paradigm, otherwise you&#x27;ll be making some unnecessary  compromises at the expense of your end users, and you&#x27;ll be making your life harder as a developer. For instance, some actions that the standalone or native version of your application does with a single click might require 3 or 4 user interventions on the browser version, simply because you wish to remain true to some dogma.<p>A while back I&#x27;ve embraced the idea that web apps aren&#x27;t documents. It freed me as an app developer to make choices that were otherwise unthinkable in a previous mindset. My APIs make more sense, my interfaces are more intuitive and my users are the happier for it.",1390115873

Actually, a keyboard with editing commands  (for cut, past, word select ... the basic VIM / emacs commands) and special keys along with a mouse and voice input could be optimal.<p>Programming is a special case, but I think programmers can cope. The languages might have to change. IIRC, C still uses the &quot;;&quot; instead of newlines, because that was optimal for punch cards, but more modern languages often don&#x27;t.<p>Most people just want to churn out emails and tweets, though.<p>The big issue is, people use much more complex grammar than when they write. It&#x27;s fine if you&#x27;re listening (since the human brain is really good at parsing spoken words), but reading what the average person will produce on a speech recognition system will be brutal.<p>Example: It&#x27;s amazing how people speak - they use split phrases, and they have long run-on sentences; often with embedded subclauses; which go on and on and are really quite complex but then they trail off when they forget what they were talking about. Oh yeah, I think it was how speech recognition is might have unexpected consequences or something.",1390115828

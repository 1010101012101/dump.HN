True enough, but some people are good at execution and some people are good at ideas. During the execution phase you're going to need more ideas, probably, to get past your MVP and on to a fully rounded product. Reminds me of the postings the other on Word of Goo - the idea was simple, implementing it was quite hard but additional ideas were added all along the way: things that transformed the product.<p>Ideas possibly are ten-a-penny, good ideas ...? Great ideas restricted to a specific market segment, they've got to be even more rare. PageRank was a good idea, sure without implementation it's nothing, without the idea there's no implementation though.",1250768788

Patents take an AGE to process so he's right you do need to be considering an application fairly soon; but if you stop pushing your sales forward and another company happens to start selling the same tech first THEY have a right to the patent too - and you might have a fight :)<p>Sell first, patent right after. Profit.<p>(if your not in the US - thr UK for example - things might be a bit different, you can get a patent a little more easily here)",1250768290

So, you pick Team A.<p>Is the fact that you picked it a useful predictor of whether Team A or Team B would have succeeded in the marketplace, and to what extent?<p>The usefulness of this type of selection is about 0%, and has the dramatically impeding side-effect of wasting Team B's time.

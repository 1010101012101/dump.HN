So if you run a simulation of a brain, does any 'thinking' happen?""<p>Of course it's just word games.  But it is equally word games to say that a machine 'thinks'.  We use thinking to describe certain processes that happen in human brains, so to say that machines 'think' is really just a sort of metaphor.<p>And if you think this is overly pedantic when discussing the possibility of the Singularity, consider this question.  If someone told you that your brain could be 'uploaded' into a computer and run as a program that for all intents and purposes would be 'you' except much smarter and immortal, would you be willing to go through with this process if it were irreversible and your current brain were destroyed as part of the process?<p>Just what is 'you' anyway?",1188230286

46998,comment,46981,46997,0,0,bmaier,,,"I think the place where business people in startups get a bad name is when you have ""salesmen"" with almost no technical understanding filling ""business development"" roles.  <p>The startups that succeed seem to be the ones that look at the process from a ""best available athlete"" standpoint.  In other words they hire the most intelligent people available and let them morph into the roles themselves.",1188227925

46996,comment,46981,46981,0,0,bmaier,,,"> They aren't systems thinkers.  They are the business equivalent of a bench researcher that simply pours blue stuff into green stuff, watches to see if it turns yellow, and then informs his boss of the result.  In both science and business, most people aren't actually innovating.<p>Hypothesis:  I think that this is the most important thing to a startup, regardless of whether you can write code or not.  Startups need systems thinkers and innovators on the code side as well as the business side, people who can grasp a problem and come up with unique solutions.  You can find these people no matter their background and this trait is likely quite tied into creativity in all its forms.",1188226812

""var"" or no ""var"" gets you local or global scope. Done. Want a constant? Make a global variable and don't change it. Want to really make sure its unchangeable? Make an accessor function.<p>Scope in JS is very simple to understand and quite versatile once understood. Adding more layers of complexity does <i>not</i> help.<p>One of the strengths of js is that <i>every thing is an object</i>(almost). So the bit about ""no more need to abuse objects as dictionaries"" is a bit odd. Since most things are objects, you get the power to treat functions, types, literals, etc in interesting ways.<p>One of the strengths of object literals is that you <i>can</i> use them as dictionaries. obj.foo === obj['foo'].<p>I love getters/setters and some other improvements like strict mode. However I am very much against what seems like an unnecessary cluttering of the language without fixing some of the long standing problems like ==/===.

I'd reckon that someone you see as ""naturally inclined"" has simply encountered problems before that lend themselves to abstract in a similar way as these new problems they face (algorithms, architecture, speaking Japanese).<p>If you believe my paradigm, then you start to realize that not only is your mind extremely flexible, but that by focusing on a varied set of similar problems, you can start developing a framework to pick up more skills faster, and thus develop that ""natural inclination"" in the field you practice.",1328903800

I need you to work for slave labor wages for the next six months, if you don't you are going to be pilloried and your reputation destroyed, no one will ever work with you ever again, you may not be able to find future employment.<p>How about it?""<p>The situation arises when you haven't covered all of the possibilities. Generally the one over looked by Kickstarter participants is the 'wildly successful' one. The dilemma is as follows, to make one of something by hand might take an hour of your time. If you are going to make 10 you might create a couple of frames or something to hold parts to make it go more smoothly so it takes three or four hours, to make 100 might involve some slightly more elaborate frames and all weekend. Now if you've priced your kickstarter such that you 'make' a couple of dollars on each unit, then you've spent your weekend making a hundred widgets and you've got $200 to show for it. If you need to make 10,000 things get more complicated. You can invest in more sophisticated jigs and holders (that eats into your profit), or more sophisticated machinery (that eats into your profit), or more help (that hugely eats into your profit) So you still 'make money' after making 10,000 but its like $2,000 over 6 months, rather than $200 over a weekend. I suspect you could find better work for $350/month. However if you had priced your widget such that you could make money building 10,000 of them, well then you're golden because you've included the cost of paying for tooling at a small factory nearby and having <i>them</i> make the widgets.  Now the second 10,000 are like 'free' since you've already got the overhead of setting up manufacturing paid for. The downside is that at the higher cost your Kickstarter might not fund that many.<p>Its just a cautionary tale for would-be kick starters to think though the various scenarios and internalize what each scenario would mean to them and then price out accordingly.",1328903432

We hadn't invested too much time or money on branding.

We came up with something better.  Although there wasn't any concrete grounds for a serious legal case (I think our names and branding were different enough) a rethink of the branding actually forced us to come up with something more relevant to our proposition.<p>Thanks to those who answered my query on Ask HN - it proved to be a quick and useful way to get advice.<p>:)",1328902921

While the root cause was never a GC bug, the GC would make it dramatically more difficult to figure out what the real problem was.<p>The closest we had to an actual GC bug was a leak involving a data structure containing a list of IP addresses that was incorrectly interpreted as containing pointers.  It took forever to figure out what had happened, since the issue only appeared if you worked with a specific set of IP addresses--and even after we had a replication case, the GC made it extremely difficult to determine why memory was growing rapidly.  The fix was simple once we identified the precise problem--flag that memory as ""atomic"" (i.e., guaranteed not to contain pointers)--but finding the precise data structure that was holding memory live was a nightmare.<p>We eventually ran into a slow memory growth issue that we couldn't figure out.  After much debugging, one developer became fed up with the situation and tore the GC out.  It took him about two weeks to produce a version of the codebase that leaked less than the GC-enabled one, and another couple weeks to eliminate virtually all memory leaks.  We continued to find minor leaks for another several months, none of which were difficult to correct.  (We used a debugging malloc library that flagged leaked memory on exit, so we always knew exactly where the leak had originated.)<p>Not only did the GC-less version leak less, it used about 40% less memory.<p>I would strongly recommend against using the Boehm collector for any long-running processes.

This isn't due to short-comings in the visual quality of games.  It's the believability of the physics of the video game world and the behavior of its inhabitants.<p>Play any 3D video game on the market and it's almost guaranteed that you'll see blatantly unphysical things happening.  In most games, your own character will move in ways such that parts of his body and clothing appear to magically pass through each other without interaction!  Run up to a wall and you'll either be stopped by an invisible force or parts of you will go into the wall like it was nothing, or both!  Jumping and running and fatigue are almost never even remotely realistic.<p>As bad as physics are, the behavior of the other creatures and beings you encounter is usually much worse!  Even the best RPG's have dialogue and interaction that would be absolutely baffling and weird if encountered in any other setting.  Here's a humorous video most Skyrim fans out there have already seen that illustrates the problem nicely.<p><a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEMD28MMtNg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YEMD28MMtNg</a><p>The next major leap in video game fidelity is not going to be graphics.  Quite frankly, they're good enough now that you can suspend disbelief.  It's the way things move, interact, and how game creatures behave that really needs to improve.  Yes, in ten years Crysis is going to seem hilariously bad, but it won't primarily be because of how a static screenshot looks.  In fact, I bet in ten years you'll be able to look at a screenshot from Crysis and say, ""Gee, that looks pretty good actually!"", but when you try to play the game it will feel very primitive.<p>In the near future I think we're going to see games devoting a lot more processing power to simulating the physics of the environment.  We're going to see greatly improved motion capture technology for video game actors bringing much more realistic facial expressions to video game characters.  The most difficult task ahead is getting video game creatures and character to behave realistically when they're <i>not</i> reading from a script.  That's going to be much harder and will likely take much longer than a decade to perfect.<p>Incidentally, with video games taking increasingly large amounts of money to develop and now being viewed as a form of art, I wonder if more attention will be made to not just preserving them for the future, but making them upgradeable to utilize the future's technology.  e.g. Already we're seeing modding communities springing up to improve various aspects of obsolete games years or even decades after their developers abandoned them.  What would happen if video game companies started planning for future re-releases?  i.e. Spend some extra time when coding games such that people ten years in the future can easily rip out an out-dated graphics engine or AI behavior module, replace it with something more modern, and then re-release the game for another hit of profit.<p>This would be, for video games, similar to the advent of home video.  Before home video came along, old movies were trash in a film canister as far as the producers were concerned.  Most movies, once they'd had their theatrical run, were done making money.  Now movies that are a hundred years old can make people money!  People do currently play old video games, but on a relatively small scale since the difference between Pong and Skyrim is a <i>lot</i> bigger than the difference between ""Battleship Potemkin"" and ""Inception"".   When you look at all the wonderful design, art, and acting that goes into a game these days, it seems like an incredible shame that the current state of video game physics should render the whole works primitive inside of ten years.  I think the economics of the video game business have reached the point where these assets are too expensive to just throw away on the video game equivalent of a ""theatrical run"".  I think companies are going to start saving stories, performances, artwork, etc. and then release new versions of games in a decade or two.",1328901263

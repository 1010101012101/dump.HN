9609070,comment,9608422,9609032,0,0,AlwaysBCoding,,,"Swift is awful to use in practice.<p>It once took me 24 hours to parse a JSON response into a Swift object. In ruby you can get a ruby object from JSON by calling JSON.parse(data)... that&#x27;s it. It takes one second. In Swift it&#x27;s a nightmare, it can take you a full day. Who the hell has time for that? Startups are all about speed, who wants to waste a day trying to parse JSON when it&#x27;s a one-liner in literally every other language ever made.<p>I also hate using mutable objects for my data model. Swift allegedly solves this with Structs but they&#x27;re really hard to use in practice. Want to pass a struct through a Notification? Too bad, needs to inherit from NSObject so guess you&#x27;re stuck using mutable objects?<p>Swift might be a well designed language from an academic standpoint. I have no idea, I&#x27;m new to programming. But I can say for sure that it&#x27;s horrible to use compared to other languages that I&#x27;ve used in production (Ruby, Clojure, Javascript).

Open sourcing a product can be a very smart move - it gives certainty of supply, and encourages other enthusiasts to share the building of it.<p>Back in the day, silicon chip makers would allow their competitors to make copies of their chips so that consumers would know that if either company went bust they still could procure the chips they needed to build their products.

I think only Steve Jobs style keynote addresses really use presentation software well, but that&#x27;s far too much effort for most instances.<p>On the other hand, there&#x27;s definitely some merits to the format. It forces people to be concise and boil their commentary down to the essential insights. It lets people use structure more in their text: nested bullet points, different font sizes, dedicating a whole slide to one statement, etc. It also lets non-textual elements take equal prominence. It prompts readers to think about the implications of a statement for themselves rather than just skimming sentences. Basically it gives people more flexibility than just writing a report or an email. I can see why they are popular.<p>I do think better training so people could emulate Steve Jobs if they wanted to would be very welcome.",1432694983

9609042,comment,9608422,9608970,0,0,AlwaysBCoding,,,"JS->iOS is the way of the future, beacuse increasingly you can get to Javascript from any language. So for example, if your backend data system is built in Clojure you can get to Javascript via ClojureScript which is a Clojure->Javascript compiler. If you wanted to build a web application off your data model you could use your Clojure data model on the front-end, the final HTML produced is just some web rendering of that data model.<p>Traditionally if you wanted to build an iOS app off the data model, you would need to hire an iOS developer who knows XCode/Objective-C to build a separate application that communicates with your backend through some REST/JSON combination. But with React Native I can just take the ClojureScript components that I&#x27;m already rendering on web and give them alternative renderings that target iOS native, because it&#x27;s all just Javascript/React, and build my app that way. It&#x27;s much easier for the person who created the initial domain model to build native components in the exact same workflow without missing a beat. iOS native is just a rendering target for your Javascript component just like web is, and you can code it in any language that can get to Javascript.<p>In a sense you&#x27;re just building one application, and making it work natively anywhere, instead of building multiple decoupled applications. I am literally betting my future on this being a better way to build mobile applications, I&#x27;m sure that it is. The biggest barrier to making it work is the staggered release cycles you need because of the app store approval stop gates, but hopefully that will get cleaned up in the next couple years.",1432694889

Even within the United States, all political parties other than our own grant to government the right to regulate the lives of individuals and seize the fruits of their labor without their consent.<p>We, on the contrary, deny the right of any government to do these things, and hold that where governments exist, they must not violate the rights of any individual: namely, (1) the right to life -- accordingly we support the prohibition of the initiation of physical force against others; (2) the right to liberty of speech and action -- accordingly we oppose all attempts by government to abridge the freedom of speech and press, as well as government censorship in any form; and (3) the right to property -- accordingly we oppose all government interference with private property, such as confiscation, nationalization, and eminent domain, and support the prohibition of robbery, trespass, fraud, and misrepresentation.<p>Since governments, when instituted, must not violate individual rights, we oppose all interference by government in the areas of voluntary and contractual relations among individuals. People should not be forced to sacrifice their lives and property for the benefit of others. They should be left free by government to deal with one another as free traders; and the resultant economic system, the only one compatible with the protection of individual rights, is the free market.&quot;<p>&quot;Libertarians support free markets. We defend the right of individuals to form corporations, cooperatives and other types of entities based on voluntary association. We oppose all forms of government subsidies and bailouts to business, labor, or any other special interest.

It is a significant amount of work. From a standing start --- without preexisting contracts to feed me leads on new work, for instance --- it&#x27;s a <i>tremendous</i> amount of work.

It is an entirely artificial language, based on Pashto and Farsi if I recall correctly, that was imposed some 200 years ago by the British Raj  as a political decision to submit the local population.<p>To clarify: Urdu is primarily Hindi, Arabic, and some Farsi. I don&#x27;t speak any of those languages, but from what I understand, those are the primary components. Pashto is a more minor one. which has had an influence on the language due to the large number of native Pashto speakers in Pakistan.<p>Also, most of what you said is correct, but to anyone reading this, that Wikipedia page is unfortunately rather misleading. It&#x27;s not exactly <i>wrong</i> because Hindi itself is so heterogenous that it should honestly be considered multiple languages. But it says that Hindi and Urdu are mutually intelligible, which is misleading. Really, a more accurate statement would be that &quot;some speakers who identify their language as Hindi are able to understand Urdu&quot;. Many Hindi speakers[0] would not be able to understand Urdu; many have difficulty even understanding other Hindi speakers.<p>For example, most of my family speaks fluent Hindi[1]. However, none of them can actually understand Urdu <i>except</i> the ones that also happen to speak Arabic (because they lived in Arabic-speaking countries for a few years). It&#x27;s like how English speakers may be able to pick out some German words, but not actually understand the language when spoken, whereas learning Dutch might help them bridge the gap.<p>This is similar to the situation with Arabic, which we treat as a single language, but is actually a spectrum of many different languages that are partially (but not always completely) mutually intelligible. It&#x27;s hard to explain this by analogy to English speakers, unfortunately, because English dialects are relatively homogeneous by comparison[2].<p>[0] and I&#x27;d be willing to venture most, though it depends <i>very</i> much on which regions and religions you survey<p>[1] Again, to be precise, this means that they use the name &quot;Hindi&quot; to refer to the language that they speak.<p>[2] which says more about what we classify as &quot;English&quot;, which is a political decision rather than a linguistic one, which brings us back to the original point all over again.",1432692816

In March of 2014, I started to learn making iOS apps (previously making Windows 8 apps) and have been learning as much as I could about it since then.<p>Last month, I decided to attempt to get a WWDC scholarship by creating an app about myself. I noticed they said they would be giving financial aid to certain situations, so I thought I wouldn&#x27;t have to worry about paying for plane and hotel expenses. A couple weeks later and a lot of work, I finished the app and submitted it to the scholarship. A couple more weeks roll by, and I receive a scholarship from Apple!<p>Now that I&#x27;ve received a ticket to WWDC, I started asking Apple about the financial aid they said they were offering and explained my situation of how I wouldn&#x27;t be able to go unless I got aid, and...<p>They said they couldn&#x27;t help me out this time. The last chance I have left is looking for a sponsor(s) to help me pay for travel expenses to go to WWDC.<p>I was wondering if anyone on HN or any websites, companies, etc that would like to sponsor me so I can go to WWDC?<p>The cheapest ticket from Denver, Colorado to San Francisco, California is $333. The place to stay can range from $350 total (AirBnB) and $125 a night/$750 total (split hotel room with other WWDC scholarship winner). Also, my brother has to come with me since I am a minor. The total cost of the trip comes out to $1016-$1416<p>Thank you for reading this. If you would like to help out or sponsor me, you can reach me at aeip@live.com or just comment below :)<p>I&#x27;ve set up a GoFundMe right here: http://www.gofundme.com/vk9dek",1432692470

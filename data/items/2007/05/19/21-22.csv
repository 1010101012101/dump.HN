23286,comment,23284,23284,0,0,master54,,,"I created a 7 months old startup that is growing well. Not fantastic but ok. Now i'm looking for someone to be the CEO. <p>He wants 50% equity, if he could get VC funding based on a high company valuation, say USD 20 million (which i think is really high for my startup). If he can't reach the target, then he'll settle for less.<p>Is this fair? I put in the hard work for this past 7 month. All the idea is mine. now he wants to be on the same level as me, just because he can get funding based on high valuation.<p>If not, how much do you think he should get. Considering that he's being hired in an important position - CEO.<p>How much did Pierre Omidyar give Jeff Skoll?",1179610303

If you want more control over the plane, then you will need to pay.  You might be able to fly for free if you can demonstrate that your flying skills will draw a large audience.\n",1179610133

23283,comment,23266,23266,0,0,yubrew,,,"that's a really interesting idea.  the biggest questions i have are....\n1. how much will it cost?  for equipment, sensors, etc?\n2. is anyone willing to pay for it?<p>If you don't want to ask anyone in particular, you can ask yourself other feasibility questions like:\n-how heavy will it be?  will it affect the flight of the plane?\n-how much do current planes cost?  how does that compare to the cost of adding a camera device?\n-how many people fly planes?  how many planes do they have?\n-how often do people crash planes, and why do they crash?  how expensive is it to fix?  how does this cost compare to a camera that could prevent a crash?<p>my initial guess is that there is no feasible business model there, but what if you twist your idea around a bit?  such as sharing videos of airplane flights? and modifying video equipment so that it could be installed on model airplanes?  that could potentially be useful.",1179609915

That said, if some people are saying they don't get it, you should do something about that.",1179609599

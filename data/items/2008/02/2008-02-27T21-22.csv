It gives you an api for free and there are plugins/gems that you could modify to fit into the semantic web.<p>BUT, I don't think this 'semantic web' is ever going to be achieved. Most of the big players want you to give the information to them. Sure they give you an API, but it's against the terms of service to take your data out(Youtube,Facebook). I think when those barriers break we could get closer to it, but how are they going to make money?<p>Maybe I am wrong.",1204149481

125019,comment,124763,124763,0,0,nickb,,,"HTML >> Flash.<p>Personally, I absolutely LOATHE flash/flex only sites. They behave horribly on the usability side, lack simple stuff like 'back button' and text sizing, and they task/heat up the CPU like you wouldn't believe (especially on a Mac).<p>Flash has a purpose on the web... you can use it for various widgets that are impossible to do in HTML (say, recording and playing video and playing back animations and audio). But I'd never use it as a general presentation layer.",1204149095

Since it varies from platform to platform you better pick the one you are going to use (Postgres, mySQL, etc.) -- Don't fall into those ORM which hides the database behind a ""nice"" api. for programming I would suggest you Python.
The best place to start is by looking at <a href=""http://webpy.org"" rel=""nofollow"">http://webpy.org</a> which is a compact yet robust web framework in Python.<p>good-luck",1204148411

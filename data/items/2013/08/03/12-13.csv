People think it wont have and effect on them, so they just ignore it.

The conspiracy theories are not completely off regarding that about half of the authors of the ADD/ADHD sections of the DSM-IV were paid by pharma companies [1].<p>That does not change the fact that ADHD is a dysfunction of the brain where the regulation of Dopamin and/or Serotonin does not meet the requirements of the environment.<p>I think it rather tells us something about the diagnosis which isn&#x27;t handled very carefully in many cases, especially for children. A proper long term validation of symptoms and evaluation of treatment methods should be a starting point, not a standardized set of questions and a recipe at the end of the session. Behavioral therapy can sometimes be as effective as drug use but it is not even considered most of the time.<p>Without extended knowledge of the topic the public almost has to think that ADHD is a fraud. It&#x27;s nothing one can see as a broken leg and the media only reports about Fraud and instant subscriptions to children that might not even have ADHD.

Literally. The original name for it was the &#x27;grave&#x27;, proposed in 1793 but it fell victim to the French Revolution like its creator, Lavoisier. So begins the tale of the most unusual SI unit. The kilogram is the only base unit with a prefix in its name, and the only one still defined by a physical artifact, the international prototype kilogram or IPK.<p>But the problem with this definition has long been apparent. The IPK doesn&#x27;t seem to maintain its mass compared to 40 similar cylinders minted at the same time. The goal is therefore to eliminate the kilogram&#x27;s dependence on a physical object. Two main approaches are being considered to achieve this end: the Avogadro Project and the Watt Balance.<p>The Avogadro project aims to redefine Avogadro&#x27;s constant (currently defined by the kilogram -- the number of atoms in 12 g of carbon-12) and reverse the relationship so that the kilogram is precisely specified by Avogadro&#x27;s constant. This method required creating the most perfect sphere on Earth. It is made out of a single crystal of silicon 28 atoms. By carefully measuring the diameter, the volume can be precisely specified. Since the atom spacing of silicon is well known, the number of atoms in a sphere can be accurately calculated. This allows for a very precise determination of Avogadro&#x27;s constant.<p>Special thanks to Katie Green, Dr. David Farrant, the CSIRO, and the National Measurment Institute for their help.

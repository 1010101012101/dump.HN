Under the premise that the employee will have to do all the work required for the company's success, give his full. The company expects the employee, to take the risk of loosing money through lesser monthly salary and loosing out money on stocks(which happens if the company doesn't do well), but yet not sacrifice even a atom worth work in effort.<p>And yet when the company is successful, now the company feels it has rights to dump the employee and deny all the compensation for work, risk and lesser monthly pay.<p>And all this for what? Because you suddenly realize that somebody whom you had promised to pay is getting big money. And you feel out of your own self elitist attitude that he doesn't deserve it, then you decide to dump him so that you can pocket money instead.<p>Seems like classic tissue example to me.

The purists would claim that Tea Party is about small government, like the Occupy movement purist would claim that it's about restoring bank regulation. But at this point both movements, being more or less leaderless, have grown wildly beyond the confines of the people that started it.<p>Like #Occupy, the Tea Party IMO has become an easy label and an easy rallying cry for whatever ails you. What started as a movement for small government has also attracted economic reformers, people who don't like taxes, freedom of speech activists, McCarthyan anti-communists, social darwinists, and yes, plenty of racists too who just aren't very happy about that black guy. Go look at what people are carrying and yelling at Tea Party rallies, and you'll see plenty of all of the above.<p>Similarly, go look at an Occupy rally and you'd have trouble telling what they stand for, even approximately. We have economic reformists, anarchists, environmentalists, black bloc hooligans, people who want to lynch all bankers, anti-corporate types, <i>militant</i> anti-corporate types... Some people want corporate power reigned in, an equally large contingent seem to just want the end of capitalism.<p>Both movements are really just a sea of disparate interests groups trying to pretend they represent some kind of unified voice.",1321000883

These are shares that employees have already been paid. This payment is contingent upon the employee continuing to work at the company. Zynga is in effect blackmailing these employees. They are telling them ""Give us this money we promised you, or we'll fire you.""<p>The idea behind putting together a plan to keep early employees highly motivated is that you all work hard to grow the company, and in return for the risk and hard work you stand to make a lot of money. That's the whole idea behind tech startups. To grow the company and then tell these employees they don't get the rewards promised them the entire time they have worked there is ridiculous. It violates the entire idea behind vesting shares, which if it is unclear, is that you have already earned those shares. It's merely a matter of when you gain access to them.",1320999391

3223847,comment,3220819,3223774,5,0,grellas,,,"It is very hard for a company to prove willful failure to perform duties when an engineer is actually executing on assigned projects, or at least attempting in good faith to execute. Engineers who have contractual protection against termination without cause are usually well-protected against arbitrary terminations on ""non-performance"" grounds and the company has to do a lot more than loosely assert (in ""he said / she said"" fashion) that someone's performance comes up short. Moreover, in most cases, the contract clause will specify that, in order to effect a termination on this ground, the company must give notice to the employee specifying why the performance is inadequate and give the employee a window within which to cure any defects in performance. This makes it doubly difficult to terminate someone on non-performance grounds because the charges have to be detailed and there will always be an argument about whether any deficiencies were cured if the employee is actually trying to perform all assigned duties. The company can try to document such cases all it wants but will normally hold a losing hand in trying to prove ""cause"" on that ground in such cases.<p>The Zynga cases are different, however, because the employees being squeezed in those cases are almost certainly pure at-will employees who have no contractual protection against being terminated without cause. Without the contractual protection, such employees can be terminated for pretty much any reason in the normal case and, if ""non-performance"" is cited as the reason, the company does not need to prove anything to back this up. ""Non-performance"" in such cases is often nothing more than a label used to rationalize a decision made on who knows what ground (e.g., on the ground that the company just wants to get someone's potentially valuable stock back before it vests).",1320998538

I agree that auto recommendation would be a 'plus' but as for search, when I want to find something I would use their normal interface (much faster).",1225086307

344881,comment,344595,344718,0,0,walterk,,,"Logic is good, but in my experience, it's virtually impotent in the face of intellectual dishonesty (and this is a great list). If the person you're arguing against is so invested in their opinion that they're unwilling to seriously consider the possibility that they might be wrong, then your appeal to logic, no matter how clear or rigorous, will fall on deaf ears.<p>But more important than even logic, in my opinion, is sense, which is the stuff on which logic is based. But it's also the basis for much else that makes up what we call ""judgment"", which relies on considerably more than the exercise of good logic.<p>After having my ideology overturned many a time, from conservatism to socialism to objectivism to liberalism, I've learned that the best intellectual policy is to simply assume that even your most strongly held beliefs are wrong, and attempt vigorously to prove it.",1225085643

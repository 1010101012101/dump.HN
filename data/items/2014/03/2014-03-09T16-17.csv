7368946,comment,7367855,7368341,2,0,alan-crowe,,,"My home made one that I got working in 1981. A friend had built a machine around a 6800 and I had used the 6800 during a vacation job at Ferranti. The single index register of the 6800 was a pain. One was always swapping indexes between X and RAM. Should I build a 6800 machine and suffer? The 68000 was being talked about and was going to be a lovely machine for assembler programmers, somewhat like the IBM360. But that could be a long wait for a processor which might be beyond my budget at first.<p>So I went with the 6809. It was enough of an improvement over the 6800 to be bearable and available and reasonably priced.<p>(The 6502 had two index registers, which was nice, but they were 8 bit, and I had ambitions to write a Lisp for my machine and would certainly want 16 address registers.)",1394384388

7368944,comment,7365507,7368293,7,0,pdonis,,,"<i>I think it&#x27;s very important to make people comfortable with the idea that they often make mistakes and their thinking is not up to par.</i><p>I don&#x27;t think &quot;comfortable&quot; is the right word here. People who feel comfortable with failure will continue to fail. It&#x27;s important for people to understand that they will make mistakes, yes, and that they should not be stopped by it--they should try to do better next time. But to me that&#x27;s the exact opposite of feeling &quot;comfortable&quot; with making mistakes; making mistakes should make you feel <i>uncomfortable</i> until you&#x27;ve figured out how to not make those mistakes again.<p><i>Her way is to inflict guilt</i><p>I don&#x27;t think &quot;guilt&quot; is the right word here either. She is expressing disappointment, but it&#x27;s disappointment with what the person did, not with who the person is. &quot;Guilt&quot; implies that she is saying they&#x27;re a bad person, and she&#x27;s not; she&#x27;s saying they could have done better.<p><i>Why not just focus on the thought process and try to detach emotions from it</i><p>Because the emotions are what motivate a person to do better.<p><i>At one time this someone won&#x27;t be there</i><p>True; and what happens then will depend on how well the person has internalized the <i>emotional</i> drive to do better. That won&#x27;t happen if the only coaching they&#x27;ve gotten is dispassionate commentary on their thought processes. If nobody expresses disappointment when they make mistakes, they won&#x27;t learn to be disappointed with themselves when they make mistakes, so they won&#x27;t care about doing better.<p><i>If you act like the woman from the article people will avoid you</i><p>But that doesn&#x27;t seem to be happening; the woman&#x27;s students don&#x27;t seem to be avoiding her, they seem to be taking her criticisms seriously and improving their game.",1394384370

Add cross-references and people could really check their undestanding of the license text they&#x27;ve read.<p>Actually, I was hoping this would be exactly that resource, and that is why I asked in another comment about whether there&#x27;s any legal backing behind this project.  Because if somebody is going to write an elaborate guide to some license, it&#x27;d better be good, and not based on common misconceptions.",1394384296

When will they upgrade?<p>I don&#x27;t know how much this will hurt MS with its core users. XP is largely kept alive by users in the East, not the West, and by businesses. The businesses will either pay for additional security or upgrade, and many of the users in Eastern countries don&#x27;t pay for XP as it is, so what exactly is MS risking here?<p>MS needs to move on. There is no money in continuing to support a 13-year-old OS.

The United States already has the infrastructure in place (the Interstate Highway system) to make self-driving cars a quite feasible means of long-distance, point-to-point transportation. The United States cities and towns in the central part of the United States are largely where they are because they are along historic railroad lines, but the railroad lines in my region of the country are increasingly being turned into rails-to-trails dedicated biking and walking paths, which I can take on very long trips from my immediate neighborhood, and except for the parts of the United States where there are already a lot of train users (notably the Northeast Corridor), there is not likely to be much increase in consumer demand for train rides, no matter how great the government subsidies supporting them.<p>China has rushed ahead in high-speed rail development, at the cost of human life[2] and corruption,[3] but the United States has no need to follow this example. We will mostly be taking long-distance trips here by plane (as we already do) or by car (as we also already do, except with self-driving becoming more and more commonplace). There isn&#x27;t any particular need in the United States to build new high-speed train lines.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.wired.com/magazine/2012/01/ff_autonomouscars/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.wired.com/magazine/2012/01/ff_autonomouscars/</a><p><a href=""http://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424127887323808204579085271065923340"" rel=""nofollow"">http://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB1000142412788732380820...</a><p><a href=""http://www.wired.com/autopia/2014/01/safety-self-driving-car/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.wired.com/autopia/2014/01/safety-self-driving-car...</a><p><a href=""http://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424052702304428004579354520148991170"" rel=""nofollow"">http://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB1000142405270230442800...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2011/12/29/world/asia/design-flaws-cited-in-china-train-crash.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nytimes.com/2011/12/29/world/asia/design-flaws-ci...</a><p><a href=""http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2012/10/22/121022fa_fact_osnos?currentPage=all"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2012/10/22/121022fa_fact_...</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jul/08/liu-zhijun-sentenced-death-corruption"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jul/08/liu-zhijun-sent...</a>",1394383554

If there were some government policy by which all Americans could be made filthy rich (ignoring the intrinsic impossibility of that), I don&#x27;t think anyone would consider that a realization of the American Dream either.  The dream assumes that money is a central value in society, of course, but maybe that&#x27;s because things like inner peace, being a good person, and deeper notions of happiness haven&#x27;t historically been explicitly constrained in so many human societies the way the ability to accumulate money has.<p>Out of curiosity: if Americans are prototypically self-motivated and desire to make money, push the frontier, explore, and invent, and that Europeans don&#x27;t (as a culture) dream of those things, do Europeans have widely shared dreams?

A law was passed in India called the &quot;Foreign Exchange Regulation Act&quot; in 1973 with the aim of regulating payments and foreign exchange. It contained language that was extremely restrictive for any foreign investments, by all foreign entities including Indian citizens living abroad.<<<<p>I&#x27;m pretty sure that you have misunderstood the law. Here&#x27;s a report prepared by a group at the University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign in 1987;<p>&quot;&quot;&quot;During 1977, IBM was asked to withdraw from India due to its unwillingness to comply with the Foreign Exchange Regulation Act (FERA) of 1973. Earlier, IBM commenced operations in India in 1952, with long term objectives of growth and increasing market share in the world com- puter and information systems market through an improved competitive stance. During a period of 25 years, IBM made total profits of approxi- mately U.S. $5 million on a total investment of $8 million. Total remittable profits, at the time of phasing out its operations in 1970, were approximately $10 million. These profits included a net asset value of approximately $5 million.<p>This poor performance was largely attributed to several factors, including compensation of approximately $7.5 million paid to employees and assets sold at less than book value. Other factors included a high rate of effective taxation of 80% to 85% as well as low rates of depreciation on equipment. IBM-India operations constituted only 0.06% of IBM Corporation&#x27;s total business. IBM&#x27;s activities in India during this period and the events leading to the IBM-India withdrawal are summarized in Appendix A.<p>During this period, the Government of India (GOI) alleged that a large number of foreign-owned and foreign-controlled corporations operating in India were making excessively high gross revenues and before-tax profits. Further, the repatriation of large amounts of capital by the multinational corporations constituted a serious drain on India&#x27;s scarce foreign exchange reserves. The GOI contended that the multinational corporations were using monopolistic power to stifle competition in the Indian market. In addition, the multinational corporations, according to the GOI, gained favorable rates for large financial credits, thereby competing with domestic firms for scarce capital. Finally, the GOI per- ceived that the multinational corporations were transferring obsolete technology or current technology of minor importance for developmental purposes.<p>Surveying the industrial scene, the GOI found that most foreign direct investment had occurred in the consumer goods sector. These ventures yielded high rates of profit and required simple technology which could be furnished by domestic entrepreneurs.<p>Based on these findings, the GOI formulated its own priorities with regard to the country&#x27;s development. With an abundance of natural re- sources and a large supply of low-cost skilled labor, India provided the multinational corporations with a large, untapped market and opportunity to enhance their international competitiveness.<p>Taking stock of its developmental priorities and increased bargaining strength, the GOI formulated its desire to influence the course of foreign direct investment in India. The primary objective was to ensure that foreign direct investment in India would fall in line with the nation&#x27;s developmental priorities. The means adopted to achieve this objective was the Foreign Exchange Regulation Act (FERA) legislated on January 1, 1974.<p>Foreign Exchange Regualtion Act— The FERA affected all foreign companies with foreign equity exceeding 40 percent. According to FERA, four levels of foreign equity participation were permitted.<p>First, all trading companies engaged in purely commercial activities as well as manufacturing enterprises utilizing &quot;non-sophisticated&quot; technology, were required to reduce their foreign equity to 40 percent.<p>Second, &quot;high technology&quot; companies, utilizing &quot;sophisticated&quot; technology and/or engaging in &quot;special&quot; activities, as designated by the GOI, were permitted to retain a foreign equity holding of 74 percent.<p>A third intermediate level of 51 percent foreign equity was established for multi-activity companies engaged in both sophisticated technology fields and other commercial and trading activities.<p>The fourth level of 100 percent foreign equity was permitted only in those instances where foreign firms were engaged in purely export activities.&quot;&quot;&quot;<p><a href=""https://www.ideals.illinois.edu/bitstream/handle/2142/28913/changingmultinat1332nega.pdf?sequence=1"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.ideals.illinois.edu/bitstream/handle/2142/28913/...</a><p>That sounds like an equity grab to me.<p>>>> b. This was not initially a concern, but became a huge problem during a 21 month period between 1975-77 when a state of emergency was declared in India [[following the assassination of the then Prime Minister]] edit: incorrect attribution, emergency was declared, but the prime minister was assassinated a few years later.<p>c. The law was fixed/made more flexible in 1993, and foreign investments immediately started returning. <<<<p>The assassination in of itself was a result of an intense power struggle in the Indian state. It&#x27;s not so hard to look at it and see that these people needed additional revenue and decided to pressure successful companies to get a cut of their business. You can call that market protection if you want or attach any other label, but the fact is that they saw (from their perspective) a potential source of revenue and they flexed their muscle to get a slice of the pie. It backfired and they had to drop the changes they made to get people back on the table.<p>>>> d. The act was repealed in its entirety in 1998. <<<<p>The protections were enshrined elsewhere. The only thing really changed was that now the Indian market was large enough and that the power players were willing to make nudge-nudge-wink-wink exceptions for much smaller fee.<p>>>> e. The issue mentioned in the article revolves around a complaint being made to CCI and as &quot;a complaint filed with CCI cannot be withdrawn&quot; there is no choice but to investigate.<p>f. The $5B amount is baseless and pure conjecture with no source/comment from either the Competition Commission of India, Lawmakers or Google. <<<<p>I&#x27;ve said nothing about the amount or the complaint, just that such shenanigans aren&#x27;t out of the ordinary from the Indian power players.<p>>>>Strangely there are very few to no parallels over here. It definitely does not warrant a statement as broad as India is just not a good place for anyone (other than its citizens perhaps) to do business.<<<<p>So a country where you have to get a permit for doing every small thing and there&#x27;s a bribe associated with each permit is a good place to do business?",1394383402

Yes, the FTC is satisfied for the efforts in the US market -- but Google is not just in the US. Even if many of your decisions don’t reflect that, your service impact other cultures. Google realised that early on, and considers how Indians search (in several languages) write (with many alphabets) give directions (using visible facades rather than map-inspired cardinal points); LibertyMail, Duck Duck Go, Open Street Map don’t take that into account nearly enough, and if you want a billion person to have the luxury of not facing a ‘take it or get off the internet’ monopoly… That decision, as imperfect as it is or excessive as it might come of, needs to be defended.<p>Corruption? Do you really think that’s a point to be made without proof? Just because… you don’t know of India but you have prejudice about that?<p>Threats of leaving? Really? Because that’s exactly what all Google engineers of Indian descent want to say to their family in India: you know, there are commenters on Hacker News who think that the country where I received the education that lead me to be SVP is such a backward cesspool that they’d rather strike out the entire sub-continent where I grew up and where the people I love and for whom I work all live… Google invests in incredibly creative ways to offer connexion to remote places, ethnographers to understand what services they need and how to design them, because having more people on-line is their only hope of growth, and you’d think they would react out of spite, and throw that away?

In the &#x27;early&#x27; days (I started in 1999) I sort of fell into it.  I was burnt out and walked out of a job.<p>Networking got me 2 consulting client, and things just ballooned from there.  I fell into it accidentally and learned a lot of hard lessons along the way.<p>In the early days I did a lot of fixed fee projects for small businesses.  On some projects I made tons of income; and on other projects I put in a lot of unpaid time [due to me incorrectly bidding the project and/or improperly  handling change requests.<p>I tried my hands at podcasting with a sponsorships model ( <a href=""http://www.theflexshow.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.theflexshow.com</a> ).  That made ~$30K throughout its&#x27; life.  Even though I had a huge audience for the size of the market, no one was trying to sell anything to that market.  I make ~$30K or so throughout its run and gave away a bunch of sponsorship in exchange for other services.  Not bad; but not enough to pay the bills.<p>I took the profits from the consulting business and pumped them into a product business selling advanced components to Flex developers ( <a href=""http://www.flextras.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.flextras.com</a> ).  I did this full time, stopping all consulting.  The business was, in essence, a failure.  It generated $10K per year which is a nice side income; but not a &quot;pay your bills income.  The business was slowly growing, until some Adobe PR mishaps killed executive confidence in the Flash Player as an application development platform; which killed our sales.  It was generating about $10K per year and was growing.  But, that is not enough to pay the bills.  I shut it down and open sourced all the code.<p>Now; I&#x27;m back to consulting, however the bulk of my clients right now are hourly as opposed to fixed fee.  This is very profitable because many clients just keep renewing contracts and giving me work.  However, it is the least bit satisfying because there is no defined end point and it feels like I&#x27;m just churning my wheels to kill time.  Sometimes it feels like clients are creating just enough work to keep me busy so that I&#x27;ll be there when they really need me.<p>Despite having multiple ongoing clients; it doesn&#x27;t feel like I&#x27;m a business owner because they are paying for my time, explicitly.  That isn&#x27;t scalable in any way.<p>I&#x27;m prepping to launch a book under the Nathan Barry&#x27;s &quot;Authority&quot; model which will teach Flex Developers how to program in AngularJS.

I asked my newsletter if anyone was interested in reviewing a pre-release copy and I got 20+ responses which is a significantly higher response rate than usual.  If the early interest is any indication; more people will read my book than ever bought a Flextras component.<p>I&#x27;ve also dabbled with a in Mobile Game ( <a href=""https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=air.com.igorKnots.magondaMaze"" rel=""nofollow"">https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=air.com.igorKn...</a> ), a recording studio (not online), and a CD duplication business (not online).

There are many ambiguities not covered by simple bullet point descriptions. Ask yourself, why are licenses long in the first place?<p>I defer to the IT / Digital Legal Companion, by Gene K. Landy, an actual lawyer:<p>&quot;The Myth of the Two-Page Contract<p>... Many times a client has brought us a complex multiyear distribution deal and wanted a &#x27;simple two-page agreement.&#x27; Sometimes, they even ask for a one-page deal! The ostensible goal is to cut down negotiation time. But for most negotiated deals, it is a myth that adequate contracts can be short in this way. If the lawyer tries to comply (and we have tried), the result will almost always be to make the deal ambiguous.\n...\nManaging complex deals full of contingencies with as imprecise a tool as the English language is tough enough; it is not prudent to try (or force your lawyer to try) to make agreements more risky than they have to be.&quot;<p>The sentiment could not be more clear: all that legalese is in the agreement for a reason. &quot;Simplifying&quot; licenses into bullet points does not adequately capture their content, and it is a huge UI fail to make people think that it does.<p>Let&#x27;s start with the site&#x27;s treatment of GPLv3. You get a few bullet point labels about e.g. source code disclosure plus a three-sentence summary. &quot;GPL v3 tries to close some loopholes in GPL v2.&quot; Oh, really, what are those loopholes? No discussion of code signing, patent rights, affero vs. non-affero, among many other issues.<p>Even the bullet points themselves do not adequately capture nuance. That the GPLv3 allows commercial use is technically true, hence the label &quot;commercial use&quot;. However, what isn&#x27;t mentioned is the fact that the GPLv3 separately prohibits practically every known business model for profiting from software.<p>These ambiguities are not minor issues; they are fundamental.

A quotation from one of the expert sources sums up the conclusion: &quot;&#x27;It’s still too early to draw definitive conclusions,&#x27; Dr. Cho said. &#x27;And antibiotics remain a valuable resource that physicians use to fight infections.&#x27;&quot; A couple years ago, a participant here shared a data chart from <i>Scientific American</i> that appears to no longer be at the original source but which has been mirrored[1] at the website of the journal <i>Nature.</i> The data chart points out that all-cause mortality has been steadily decreasing at all ages during my lifetime throughout the developed world. This is roughly the time span covered by the interesting article kindly submitted here. If human intake of antibiotics (which, after all, in many cases are &quot;natural&quot; substances emitted by fungi to guard against being destroyed by bacteria) has increased, as surely must be the case, it doesn&#x27;t seem to be hurting us much.<p>On the specific issue of body weight, &quot;normal&quot; weight ranges for a given height were defined years ago on the basis of statistics on weight distributions in the general population. Oddly, current mortality and morbidity statistics tend to show that the persons with longest expected lifespans are not persons with &quot;normal&quot; weight as defined by body mass index but rather persons who are (slightly) &quot;overweight.&quot; (This is however, most true for &quot;overweight&quot; persons who have good cardiovascular fitness.[2]) So if today&#x27;s population in developed countries weighs more than populations a generation ago, the issue to look at is how many people have shifted from underweight to normal weight, how many from normal weight to overweight, and how many from overweight to obsesity. Obesity is definitely harmful to health. Moderate physical exercise, the kind I get by substituting walking or bicycling to do errands for driving, is surely good for pretty nearly everyone, independent of other lifestyle factors. But it has yet to be shown that antibiotic intake in the current amounts experienced by human beings in the developed world is harmful. There has been investigation in the last decade or so of the hypothesis that some antiobiotics may be protective against heart disease,[3] for instance, although maybe not all antibiotics have the same risk-benefit profile.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.nature.com/scientificamerican/journal/v307/n3/box/scientificamerican0912-54_BX1.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nature.com/scientificamerican/journal/v307/n3/box...</a><p><a href=""http://www.pinterest.com/pin/195977021257786739/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.pinterest.com/pin/195977021257786739/</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20118386"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20118386</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC387430/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC387430/</a>",1394380892

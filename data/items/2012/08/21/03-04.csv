4411101,comment,4407204,4408537,1,0,hboon,,,"If it's referring specifically to code, I think yes, maybe if we put enough developers/teams in <i>separate</i>, locked rooms, they might eventually come up with the same implementation. But this is assuming they are providing code (solution) to solve an already-defined app (problem). And if we think about copying code, it is the source code that is being copied. Do we agree that copying code is wrong?<p>For design (again, referring to visual, UX, UI, etc, and not to software architecture design), the problem is how to make X better, e.g how to make interaction with a screen better [1]. And the solution is the design - we use fingers instead of stylus.<p>I'm thinking this out loud as I'm answering. So, it appears to me that what I am saying is, you can copy the problem (app or say UX issue) to be solved but you shouldn't copy the solution (be it code or design).<p>> Also, you probably copied someone at some point anyway.<p>I feel like going into this might be a digression so I'll try to keep this short - a specific example, when I was building my first iOS app, there was a competitor that was starting to be very well received. I'd like to say that I took note of what they did right and give my own twist to how to solve the problems which they saw important to solve. And I have specifically steered away in cases where it look like I couldn't come up with a better version, even if the replacement I had to use was not as good - a particular example was I have not to this date implement pull-(release)-to-refresh verbatim using any of the off-the-shelf OSS components in my app despite the original inventor giving permission to do it. So I do walk the walk.<p>Or maybe I did copy. But even if I smoke, I can still take the stand that smoking is harmful.<p>[1] I'm specifically referring to focusing on a finger/touch-based experience vs. using a stylus. I'm not claiming that Apple is the absolute first to do it since I had often used my thumb/finger instead of my stylus when I was using my Treo, but this is a good example of someone innovating.",1345521555

The only thing I'd change, looking back, is that having got that first job I allowed myself to get stuck. I was doing one kind of work using one set of tools and even though I got good at it and made money at it, it constrained me mentally. A lot of programmers fall into this trap. It's insidious because you don't know you've fallen into it. Something ends up having to shock you out of it and that is not a good place to be.

4411085,comment,4407808,4408207,3,0,wallflower,,,"> Anyway, Edwardss theory is that bad drawers dont look at the thing itself and draw its shape, they translate reality into abstract concepts first and then draw what that concept visually looks like.<p>This is so true.<p>By squinting one of your eyes (looking through only one eye) you can approximate the 'upside down' effect pretty remarkably.<p>Drawing is all about the relation of shapes to each other. Portrait drawing is too - but has the additional constraint of very little tolerance for off-by-one errors. Everyone is particularly attuned to facial recognition - lines that are off by even a millimeter or a fraction of an inch (by position or more generally - the angle) - you notice that. It is the difference between a portrait that looks like someone, a portrait that looks like someone else (but not her).<p>If you want to get better in portrait drawing and don't have the luxury of a live model posing for you, don't draw from pictures. Draw from live TV (like a newscast where the poses are relatively static but still fluid).<p>I've been taking a progression of art classes for just over a year now. A year is actually a long time in art class world. Really enjoying the escape from coding. It rocks because you lose yourself (like when you are on a focused coding tear). Have gotten much better yet have still so far to go. Have plateaued many times.<p>In my Portrait Drawing class, the thing that stopped me most was trying to draw what I thought the eye/nose looked like and actually drawing what it looks like. My internal model of what the eye/nose looks like is flawed because I lack experience. As an aside, if you look at other people's portraits of the model - there is usually part of the portrait that resembles them.<p>The professor was amazing. She could take a blank piece of paper and in 15 min. create the person's portrait, capture their essence. If she worked on it more and more, it got even better. But she got the basic essence in a very short time. She didn't make mistakes in positioning - like most of us in class did (we did get better by the end of the course) - to draw fast - you need to draw very accurately and with confidence. Mistakes can be corrected, up to a point.<p>If you don't draw the eye as it really looks, you can easily end up with something that looks like an egyptian mummy. There is a very clear orbital socket that needs to be shaded/drawn - without that the eye isn't an eye. Shading is so, so important.<p>Adding the little stuff to your drawing - like adding a little more shading to the half/side of the pupil that is on the dark side (away from the light) makes a difference. By itself, it doesn't add up, but it makes it look better - when adding all the other little stuff.<p>Now, drawing in public (e.g. someone's portrait for money in 15 min.) is a whole different ballgame. At least, starting with a controlled environment (precise teacher feedback) is a start. I believe the key is to have the basics down (and basically do a Mr. Potato Head from your experience drawing the basics)",1345521150

There will be so much data that unless it is indexed and collated in real-time, it will be impossible to perform queries to sort through mountains of un-indexed data. I think computers will become more like intelligent agents, bringing things that require immediate action to our attention and filing/organizing everything else for our later consumption.<p>There are already services, such as News.me and Prismatic, providing these services for Twitter.

This is the essence of the problem of Epistemic Asymmetry, according to which I can't even know if <i>you</i> are an experiential thing. Yes, of course, you look and act like one, but it's perfectly logically consistent with all of my experiences of you (and utterly, <i>a priori</i> impossible to disprove) that you don't. (Aside: if you have trouble with this notion, do some reading on zombies  and I don't mean the shuffling, groaning undead that like to eat brains. A web search on ""Chalmers"" and ""zombie"" should get you started.)<p>It might help in understanding the conclusion I've reached, to talk about how I got here. See, to my mind, no-one has yet satisfactorily answered Descartes' great question: How can I know that my experiences are at all reflective of an antecedent reality? His answer was to pull the biggest <i>deus ex machina</i> of all time, and asserted that reality is ""real"" because, well, God. That's a cop-out, if you ask me, and hand-wavy at best. So I'm left, philosophically speaking, stuck at solipsism. And, frankly, that sucks.<p>In the alternative, I have to look at the data available to me through my experiences, and try to draw some kind of meaningful conclusions from it. The first datum I examined is that all the people I interact with have an external appearance that's similar in form and nature to the thing I see when I look at myself (assuming we first posit that they actually exist, experientially or otherwise, and that my experiences aren't the product of some vast sim in which I'm trapped; if that's the case, it's game over already and there's not much point in playing). So maybe the other people have an inner, experiential nature, too. If so, what's special about people? Don't other animals, in keeping with their forms and natures, act in a way that suggests they're experiential, too? Maybe they are. So what's special about animals?<p>Follow that train long enough, of course, you end up in a bit of a <i>reductio ad absurdum</i>. You can cut the problem off by drawing some arbitrary line somewhere that says, ""Things on this side of the line are experiential, and things on the other side aren't,"" but where can you meaningfully draw that line without access to the ""inner state"" of the things immediately on either side of your line? And what is it about those things on the one side that makes them special and privileged enough to be experiential, but not the others?<p>Following, instead, the principle of positing the fewest number of entities in my attempt to dig my way out of the solipsist hell that Descartes left me in, it seems least arbitrary and hand-wavy to posit that <i>everything</i> in the ""external world"" of which I have an experience might also somehow have an experience of its own. It's as arbitrary a place as any to draw the line, but unlike every other place, it doesn't require explaining why the line happens to fall <i>there</i> and not somewhere else. Moreover, it cleanly solves the question of how it is that <i>meat</i> can <i>feel</i>. It can, because <i>everything</i> can.<p>Please note, that's not remotely to suggest that the experience a moss has, let alone a rock, or a lone hydrogen atom, is qualitatively anything like the experience I have. How can they be? The nature of my experience is the product of absolutely squillions of different interactions of all the constituent particles, atoms, cells, organs, systems and structures that make up the vessel in which I have my experiences, each having their own individual experiences of being that part of the vessel. And it's likely some of those interactions are more directly relevant to the nature of my experience than others. My femur, for example, probably has less bearing on what it feels like to be me than my spine, but it's absolutely a factor in the complex interplay that gives rise to the whole thing.<p>But again, at the end of all that searching  and this literally took me <i>years</i> of pondering, mulling, barking up the wrong tree, false starts, and starting over from first principles  it's the least arbitrary answer I can find, it posits the least number of things in the universe (only one: experiential stuff, otherwise known as ""matter""), and seems to me to neatly address some absolutely huge, and eternally open questions.<p>So, yeah. It's only a theory, but it's the best one I've got, and it beats the hell out of solipsism.<p>EDITS: there were many.",1345518412

4410939,comment,4410658,4410658,7,0,barrkel,,,"Here's my crazy crackpot theory for solving the password problem.<p>Users should have a handful of passwords, in the old security-level style; everyday sites use a short simple password, email a level up, banking a level up again.<p>But the passwords should not be entered directly into sites. Instead, they should be hashed by a browser feature / plugin, roughly equivalent to bcrypt(password + user-specific-salt + site DNS name). The output of this process is what gets provided to sites. Not all sites will accept the full entropy of bcrypt or similar, so there needs to be a central registry tracking acceptable mappings from the output of bcrypt to the input of a site's password. There's also an issue around sites that share accounts across different top-level DNS names - Amazon in particular - that can also be handled by the same central registry technique.<p>This way, there is no list of passwords to worry about backing up, losing or handing over to third parties - everyone should be able to remember two or three passwords. There is no Javascript vulnerability like you see with bookmarklets for things like SuperGenPass. Every website sees a unique and specific password, even if the same underlying password is used by different people.<p>The only thing you need to worry about is your browser getting completely owned, so that the memory space of its extension mechanism is accessed by remote websites. But if the attacker has that level of control, it's not unreasonable to think he has control over a third party password manager too.<p>What it doesn't do well is revocation and renewal of a password. It also has a single point of failure - if someone somehow gets access to your underlying password, and knows the mechanism and salt, they can open a whole lot of boxes. This, of course, is why I'm a crackpot: I can live with that.",1345518037

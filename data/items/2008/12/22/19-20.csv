Everything \nfrom the script to the casting was voted on, presumably by \nthe same lunkheads who turned Digg into an extension of \nApple marketing interspersed with unfunny comics and left-wing \ncommentary. It’s a process scientifically designed to produce a \nfilm that’s mediocre for its budget range, which apparently was \nsomewhere in between what a student film normally costs and\nmy monthly car insurance payment.</i><p>First of all, the process you've outlined in your post is <i>not</i> the process used on Massify.  Massify users voted for the story, not the screenplay.  The winner did not direct the movie, he served as a producer and got a small role in the movie.  What he did get to do, however, is sit in on the production and participate, work with the screenwriters to flesh out the story, etc.<p>Furthermore the budget for the film was way beyond the cost of a student film and your monthly insurance car payment combined.<p><i>Don’t get me wrong, it’s neat the way the process worked, but I \nguess I’m unable to see the value in coming up with a novel way \nto produce more cinematic detritus. Hollywood regurgitates this \ncrap 10 times a year, except (judging from the trailer) with more \npolish. They don’t need crowd sourcing to add to the dung heap.</i><p>It's painfully obvious you've had little to do with film, like ever.  Do you really believe most films are the work of a single individual?  Movies have been crowd sourcing since before the internet tubes.  The only thing Massify changes is who gets let into that particular crowd.<p><i>Don’t get me wrong, it’s neat the way the process worked, but</i><p>How can you call the process neat when you haven't the faintest clue how it works?<p><i>I guess I’m unable to see the value in coming up with a novel \nway to produce more cinematic detritus. Hollywood regurgitates</i><p>I'm not exactly sure our process is that novel.  All we've really done is put a web interface on the same mechanic and opened up who can participate, nothing more and nothing less.<p><i>In fact, the one thing the movie industry has going for it is \nthat it’s still much more meritocratic than most of the rest of \nAmerica. A good script is a good script, no matter who wrote it,</i><p>Again, you write with authority but it's obvious you aren't a student of film history.<p>I'd argue your points more, but discourse on the web is futile, specifically when there is a risk that the OP will be shown to be clueless and pedantic.",1229975723

406804,comment,406536,406536,0,0,markessien,,,"I think your site is excellent, your idea is good, and you can easily build this into a real business. So I'll give it to you straight, mix and match what you like.<p>If you are serious about turning this into a real business, there are some things you absolutely have to do:<p>1. ""Dashboard"", ""routines"" and ""workout"" show me the exact same page<p>2. Video is cool, but I'm not going to watch it because it's so linear. I just want one particular feature, and I don't have the time to sit and watch 10 minutes or whatever of video to find out if you have that feature. (I don't know how long the video really is, because it's not written till I push play, which I don't want to do)<p>3. Content is king. If you want to make a site, you need to struggle for every single user! Getting linked from techcrunch is an utter waste of time, because they are not your target user. Your target users searched google 40.000 times today for your site. If you had 5.000 pages of content, you'd get a percentage of those searchers. And easy way to start is by making your routines public<p>4. All you're interested in is one user. You need to continuously examine the flow of that one user - when he hit your page right up until when he signed up. Do you know EXACTLY where he clicked and what he was looking for? If you don't, it's like having a car factory, and you're not sure what steps the assembly line goes through to product a car<p>5. I have an iPhone, and your app actually sounds interesting to me. But there are no screenshots and no description of what this iphone app could do. So I'm going to close your site and forget about it instantly<p>6. Go to delicious.com/popular/fitness for inspiration<p>7. Categorize your users. I don't know the natural \ncategories for fitness, but maybe something like ""people who want to lose weight"", ""people who want to body build and are doing it regularly"", ""skinny guys who want become somewhat muscular"". For each category, look at your site again. Does it seem attractive? Are this category of interest to you? Then examine each category - which is the most profitable?<p>8. Remember that any idea you have is just an idea, and you don't know if it works. If you implement it and it works, this does not mean it was right. For example, let's say you have the idea that green may be the best color to encourage people to sign up. You change the color to green, and you have 5% more sign-ups. You'll sit back and feel satisfied that your idea worked. Big mistake, because red may have caused 50% more sign-ups. So when you have an idea or hunch, make sure you test the alternatives, even if it seems to you that they won't work.<p>That's all I got for now. Good luck!",1229975573

It makes sense that over the long haul, a more diverse ecosystem of publicly traded companies makes for a more resilient economy and more opportunities for small investors to make profitable investments.<p>Of course, the current tanking of the stock market all around the world, by no means only in the United States, might suggest that small investors need to know that the ecosystem does have selection pressure for transparency and accuracy of corporation statements to investors. I appreciate the replies by various participants here on how Sarbanes-Oxley has a different cost burden for new, smallish start-ups as contrasted with established, large public companies.

406783,comment,406359,406713,0,0,ryanwaggoner,,,"Reminds me of Zeno's paradox about Achilles and the tortoise:<p><i>Achilles is in a footrace with the tortoise. Achilles allows the tortoise a head start of 100 feet. If we suppose that each racer starts running at some constant speed (one very fast and one very slow), then after some finite time, Achilles will have run 100 feet, bringing him to the tortoise's starting point. During this time, the tortoise has run a much shorter distance, for example 10 feet. It will then take Achilles some further time to run that distance, in which time the tortoise will have advanced farther; and then more time still to reach this third point, while the tortoise moves ahead. Thus, whenever Achilles reaches somewhere the tortoise has been, he still has farther to go. Therefore, because there are an infinite number of points Achilles must reach where the tortoise has already been--he can never overtake the tortoise.</i><p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zeno%27s_paradoxes"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zeno%27s_paradoxes</a>",1229974931

I think the title should be changed to reflect that, as I almost didn't bother reading it.<p>I've slowly but surely gravitated away from using exceptions over the years, for different reasons than the author lays out (though I recognize some of what he's saying from my own experience).<p>I think the reason exceptions became popular is actually a psychological one: they are easy for the programmer. (I mean the programmer throwing the exception, not the poor sod who has to deal with it, which may be the same person of course.) You hit something you don't want to deal with? Just throw it. It's like the kids' game Hot Potato.<p>Ultimately, users pay the price for this evasion of responsibility, since they end up with a system that behaves erratically in cases that don't fit the happy path and is hard to understand. In the worst case, the exceptions are just thrown all the way up and the user ends up having to catch the hot potato. (Edit: you can generalize ""user"" here to include any programmer writing code that calls the original code.)<p>What I think is going on here is that programming is hard enough without error handling, and error handling makes it  harder still. Good error handling models are dependent on the specifics of the program in question - they need to fit the contours of the system and of the domain itself. This is hard, so we don't want to do it, and since we can get away with deferring it, we do.<p>If you take a look at the author's examples, the code snippet he describes as ""not bad"" is the only one that attempts to handle the error in place. It's also the ugliest and by far the most complicated-looking. But the complexity is latent in all the other examples too. It's just deferred.",1229974001

Eventually somebody prominent gets screwed, they make a big stink about it, and the government regulates them as if they were public.<p>This is basically the story behind investment trusts, mutual funds, and hedge funds.  Back in the 20s, everybody put their money into investment trusts.  They got screwed by the Great Crash, so the government put all these restrictions on public investment vehicles (can only invest in stocks & bonds, can have no more than 1.5% of assets in any one security, etc.) and the trusts were reborn as regulated mutual funds.<p>Then people realized that because mutual funds were so regulated, they were leaving money on the table, and all these alternative asset classes like commodities, timber, derivatives, venture capital, etc. were ripe for the taking.  So they created a new class of investment vehicle, hedge funds, without the regulations but only open to people who supposedly know what they're doing.<p>Now ordinary people are investing in hedge funds indirectly, through funds-of-funds and pensions, and they're getting screwed.  So there're calls to regulate hedge funds now.<p>Financial markets treat regulation as damage and route around it.  Unfortunately, they sink many suckers in the process and create demand for new regulation, and so on.",1229972680

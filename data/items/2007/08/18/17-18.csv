After having helped various startups, I launched GeniTeam in 2006 to provide dedicated software engineers to help entrepreneurs develop products with bootstrapping. Over the years, my own startup has gained momentum and helping promising startups based in North America, Netherland and Israel. <p>GeniTeam Business Model:-\nMany people come across innovative idea but fail to materialize it for lack of resources. The barriers for high tech startup are high for huge upfront investment requirement. Hence, many people seek funding from venture capitalists, by giving up significant amount of equity or give up idea for lack of access to funding. GeniTeam provides an alternate to such entrepreneurs by allowing them hire virtual team members with GeniTeam, at fraction of cost to help entrepreneurs materialize their dreams. The dedicated virtual team members are hosted with GeniTeam in Lahore, Pakistan and whose growth is linked to growth of startup. The time difference allows entrepreneurs to monitor and instruct virtual team members in evening and generating cash flows for startup by doing consulting or job in day time. <p>How my faith strengthened on business model:-\nThe company's business model has evolved out of my personal consulting for CambridgeDocs, an XML conversion company. I worked single handed from my home in Pakistan, to help the startup expand its product line. During my consulting, I refined ""virtual team"" model and build the confidence to expand virtual team in Pakistan. After 6-8 month of successful work, the company decided to start its offshore operation in Lahore, Pakistan. This strengthened my faith on my business model, as most of the engineers working with CambridgeDocs were graduates of Massachusetts Institute of Technology, USA. After establishing and training initial resources for offshore office, I started helping multiple companies. Over last 3 years, I have refined the processes for virtual team and created few more success stories.<p>Does GeniTeam take Equity:-\nWe only take equity if we invest with the startup. Our resource cost is pretty nominal, and hence startup's generally don't need to share equity. The partnering startups are free to change vendor or quit us, if they wish. They also have an option of acquiring virtual team to own the startup team. <p>Then how does GeniTeam make money:-\nGeniTeam primary cash flows are through product development. GeniTeam is working on ""Team Room"", ""Multiplayer Mobile Games over GPRS"", and online tutoring application, developed in rich internet applications. In future, GeniTeam would like to help startups refine ideas and develop marketing plans.<p>Is GeniTeam a traditional outsourcing company?\nOur philosophy is radically different from traditional outsourcing companies. GeniTeam believes in building partnerships with startups, and growing with them. GeniTeam is serving niche high tech startup segment, not catered by traditional outsourcing companies. Distinguished by vision, our model allows partnering companies build and retain expertise X as they could do by hiring resource with them. <p>How can people manage people from 10000 miles away?\nThis is the most frequent question I hear on sales. I believe internet has revolutionized our lives, and also the work environments. With such changes, virtual team and virtual office have become reality. However, the processes to manage virtual team are slightly different and require enhanced communication and reporting techniques. It requires almost 1 to 2 months, to fully reap the benefits of virtual team. I personally believe, it really worth investing time and few bucks in idea.<p>\nHow to Contact GeniTeam?\nPlease visit www.geniteam.com to know us more and contact us at sales@geniteam.com for details.<p><p>",1187459503
43831,comment,43799,43827,0,0,cperciva,,,"I have to disagree with your assertion that the soundest field in CS is graphics.  My field is algorithms (in particular, numerical and algebraic algorithms): I describe a problem, describe an algorithm, prove that the algorithm works, prove the algorithm's running time, implement the algorithm, and then write a paper saying ""look, my algorithm is faster than that other guy's algorithm"".  What could possibly be sounder than experimental results backed up by rigorous mathematical proof?<p>As for picking a supervisor vs. picking a university -- I agree with this with one very small caveat.  If you don't need any supervision -- by which I mean that you've done independent research before and have a good idea of what research you're going to be doing as a graduate student -- there's really no need to pick a supervisor.  My supervisor, Richard Brent, is one of the greatest people in my field in the world; but this was entirely coincidental, and in my time in Oxford I probably saw him an average of once every three or four months.  I could have been at the University of Timbuktu (if there is such a place?) and received adequate supervision; the greatest benefit Oxford provided to my research was to open doors for me -- it's amazing how many people pay attention to an email which starts ""I am a doctoral student at Oxford University"".<p>One final remark about supervisors: If you're planning on applying to do a doctorate and there's a particular professor whose research interests you, you should absolutely contact them; if you're planning on applying to do a master's, please don't.  There are far too many wannabes with no research experience entering master's programs to have a personal dialogue about one's research with every one of them.",1187458951
43830,comment,43822,43822,0,0,nostrademons,,,"This is true, and an astute observation.  It's also unavoidable - or at least one of the better alternatives.<p>Everybody has their own ideas of how things <i>should</i> be.  In a society of 300 million people, that means 300 million different ideas.  There will be some overlap, but obviously they won't <i>all</i> think the same things - then they'd <i>really</i> be brainwashed.<p>Unfortunately, there's only one way that things actually <i>are</i>.  So somehow you've got to condense the myriad of different cultures, beliefs and desires into a single reality.  Governments have relied on various ways of accomplishing this:<p>1.) Kill everyone who doesn't agree with the ""official"" culture.  Eg. Rwanda, Bosnia, Stalinist Russia, Nazi Germany, U.S. conquest of Native Americans<p>2.) Kill the most vocal proponents of alternate viewpoints, enough to terrorize the remaining citizens into keeping with the party line.  Eg. modern Russia, several South American governments, apartheid South Africa<p>3.) Convince the population that eternal damnation awaits anyone who disagrees with the party line.  Eg. the Catholic Church<p>4.) Split the population into many little populations, each of which can have their own reality.  Eg. former Yugoslavia, former Soviet Union, American Civil War, Roman Empire.  Problem with this is that each sub-state <i>still</i> wants to impose its reality upon its neighbors, so you often get continual warfare until one gobbles up the others.<p>5.) Convince a majority of the population that they really agree with you.  This is the ""discrimination and brainwashing"" you refer to.<p>6.) Develop some fundamental principles that everybody agrees on, then agree to disagree on the specifics, knowing that eventually reality will come swing your way.  Eg. the Enlightenment theory behind liberty and democracy<p>#6 seems to be the ideal, but it requires some cognitive dissonance, namely the ability to say ""I disagree with what you're doing, but will defend your right to do it.""  Most people are not capable of this kind of cognitive dissonance - either they slip into ""I will not defend your right to do this"" and end up with #1 or #2, or they slip into ""I agree with what you're doing"" and end up with #5.<p>So #5 is the most stable system that a large civilization can enter.  Most Western democracies actually function as a combination of #5 and #6, with the masses adjusting their beliefs to fit their leaders and the leaders themselves agreeing to disagree under fundamental principles.  U.S. democracy is currently in danger because a disturbing number of ""leaders"" (on both sides) are suggesting #1 or #3, but the political party system is meant to encourage #6.<p>Incidentally, the same problem happens with multi-party governments.  Most multi-party systems are actually run by coalitions, where a bunch of parties get together and say ""Okay, I don't totally agree with all of your viewpoints, but for the sake of getting things done I'll let you do things your way.""",1187458296
43829,comment,43793,43793,0,0,Tichy,,,"I have all sympathy for heretics, but to claim that CO2 is not a problem because there could be a countermeasure seems like very flawed logic. Apart from the countermeasure not really convincing me (genetically engineer plants to grow faster???), without recognizing the problem, it is unlikely that the countermeasures would be taken, so it would still remain a problem (assuming it is a problem - I merely wanted to point out the flawed logic).",1187458172

43827,comment,43799,43813,0,0,mencius,,,"Both these comments are dead on.<p>Never, EVER go to grad school the way I did - just noticing that your four years are up, and seeing where you have to apply next, so you can keep on proving how smart you are.<p>Going to grad school straight out of college is almost always a mistake in any field, and it is especially a mistake in CS.  Spend a couple years as a working programmer first, ideally at a small company.  <p>One, it may change your mind - this should be embraced, not feared.  And two, if you do go to grad school, you will find you have much more perspective and depth than your fellow grad students.<p>Since there is no such thing as CS, every field is different.  Some just decrement the ""C"".  Others are perfectly healthy.  <p>Without question the soundest field in CS is graphics.  I wish to God I had gone into graphics.  Digital image synthesis is actually applied math, of course, and any area of applied math <i>that actually has a real application</i> will serve you well.  <p>Unfortunately, pseudoapplied math is very common and quite worthless.  So be sure to look fairly deeply into any claims of applicability.  A genuine applied field, such as graphics, will have a steady flow of innovations (and innovators) into actual industrial practice.  If you don't see this, something, somewhere, is wrong.  Trust the nose.<p>Also, when you apply, don't just select schools by reputation, as if you were applying to college.  Pick the actual group you want to work with, and don't be shy about contacting professors.",1187456663

I'm sure early emails and early web searches were frivolous b/c people had been getting along fine w/o them.  Early cell phone calls were, ""OMG!!  I'm walking down the street talking on the phone!!!  This is so cool.""   etc.<p>At the same time I agree w/ maroon.  Social networks are not my thing.  Think about how you meet and maintain relationships with people in the real world.  You're usually talking to someone you know and they introduce you to someone else.  The conversation naturally veers toward common ground where a relationship can be built.  I haven't seen a company reproduce this.  <p>I never met anyone new on a social network.  I never had the nuggets to ask anyone out and the ones who asked me out were either no-go's or bonafide prostitutes (yes I was on myspace for a few months.)<p>One of my co-founders said it best.  ""Facebook is for maintaining aqaintences."" ",1191667733

 * Buzz, even negative, really matters. Despite negative comments about the rewrite, without this it is very likely that they would not grow so quickly.</code></pre>",1191667308

I went through Pet, CPM, bubble memory, Forth, Dr Jobs, Turbo C, Smalltalk and was very near to a solution with microProlog (it came as an 8""floppy). Then Winston and Mellish ruined it for me. It's done even better now with amb and monads but life has never been quite the same.

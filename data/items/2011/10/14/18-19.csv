3112444,comment,3112029,3112029,135,0,saurik,,,"So, in 2005 I was involved in a company that thought ""man, it would be great to build a search engine for source code"". I even started putting together components for it, such as a model for finding text inside of larger documents that had statistical properties similar to code, auto-detecting the language, so you could find code snippets inside of blog posts.<p>However, by the time we got organized enough to actually do it, Google Code launched, and had this really awesome code searching feature, that everyone considered to be ""more than good enough"" and ""comprehensive, as Google is indexing the hell out of stuff like this"".<p>But, now, Google has now determined that that wasn't sustainable, and has shut down the project. Which means that both our company, and any other company, that thought it had a sustainable model for running such a project, and at this point would probably be ""pretty awesome"", never started, and we are all suddenly thrust back into 2005, unable to search for code.<p>This... (I now emphatically point at the previous paragraphs) is why I don't like Google very much: they have such large resources available to them that they tend to just swoop in and offer an unsustainable service at a loss, training users that ""things should be so free it hurts: in fact, they must be losing money on every use of this"" (Google Voice being a great example), thereby stifling innovation by people who can't possibly undercut that.<p>Note: this isn't even a problem specific to Google... startup companies that get VC money tend to also cause this problem. They get tons of money, offer a service at a heavy loss while they use that burn time to determine a business model, actively knowing that they are operating at a loss in order to get users as fast as possible from other people who might try to get them.<p>Of course, the result is that the company usually either totally implodes (typical of any startup) or, even more insidiously (for the projects that actually becoming successful, even quite popular / common), come up with a business model so ludicrous that the users actively revolt against the entire concept of the service...<p>... and, where do they go? To some other free service offered by another company that managed to get equally large sums of VC money because they point at that other company that had hundreds of millions of users that just failed because of a bad business model, something they will know how to fix (in a couple years or so, once they get around to figuring that part out...).<p>:( I liked Google Code search, and I'm going to miss it.",1318618721

There are lots of complicated reasons why a platform becomes popular or not.<p>Also, there very much is an aspect of trust involved. Apple and google built up a lot of trust in different ways in providing excellent experiences to users. Apple with OS/X and the iPod. Google with gmail, search, maps, chrome, etc. When presented with the idea of an iPod phone or a google-apps phone a lot of people had enough trust to buy into it. As those platforms have matured that trust has only grown.<p>MS has the opposite problem. MS has built up distrust with its previous, clunky iterations of windows mobile, and it hasn't built up sufficient trust in its ability to even <i>deliver</i> reliably.

A number of people miss the <i>functional</i> aspect of bottled water which is that you are going from point a to point b and you want to drink something on the way.<p>As it turns out, the data collected supported the hypothesis that a significant fraction of the bottled water drinkers were of this category (not drinking it because it was 'better' but drinking it because it was water convieniently packaged for transport in a single serving). The result was that removing bottled water simply lead to substitution of other beverages which were not 'water' but were convieniently packaged.<p>A lot of folks suggested carrying around a drinking bottle or mug so that you could refill it at various points. And, giving free water bottles to people, that did meet some of the need (not sure how widely that program was tried).<p>A proposed solution that was never even tried was to have Google bottle its own water on site (very eco, very doable) and stock that. This would have satisfied just about everyone except it didn't pass the 'saves money' test, which was, ultimately the basis for all of the changes.<p>And it is always the responsibility of management to manage their costs effectively.

It's hard to figure out what motivates people, and it differs enormously across cultures. You could have the most effective $100 house around, and you could even have a way of distributing the physical product to hundreds of thousands of people living in poverty. But what happens when no one wants to live in your house -- because, as it turns out, your house is foreign, not cozy; it just doesn't feel like home.<p>Does that seem like a silly example? It's not. The poor are not as easy to figure out as some people think. Understanding their motivations -- immersing yourself in their cultures and understanding what they really want, what really drives them to make certain decisions -- is the key to good design.<p>And, unfortunately, it's an aspect of good design that's not easily scalable.<p>Obviously, there are pockets where you can start and grow from. But saying that a billion people are waiting for $100 houses -- as if the only issue is designing that damn thing to get the price down! -- strikes me as not being the best way to begin a dialogue on poverty alleviation.",1318618506

I'd need to do research and it's probably what you've already covered, from the sounds of the conversation already here. If I were faced with the decision knowing what I know today, I'd use some queuing system RabbitMQ or other AMQP protocol with a pool of DB servers sucking up requests and processing them. You can maintain a synchronous response with the requesting server via some frontend code (Python w/ Django or Node).<p>With this setup, you can easily throw more DB instances in the pool to grow with your needs. The frontend should be able to handle as many requests as needed (especially Node which has VERY lightweight threads, I hear). You'll just need to reduce the turnaround time via the queue.",1318618479

For them, that constitutes failure. Very few people were using Notebook, Calendar Search, Wave, or Code Search. I'm sure it's fairly simple to calculate the cost benefit of devoting even minimal resources to a product that 1. doesn't make money; and 2. doesn't substantially make the web better for some minimum threshold of people.<p>Google is one of the richest companies in the world and could afford a lot of things, but that's not justification that it should.<p>You're right that there's an interesting tension between starting/failing fast and getting people to trust that a product will stick around. But I don't actually think that's a big part of the calculation for most people. When Google releases a new product, I usually go either ""Ooh, that sounds awesome, I'm signing up for the beta immediately,"" or ""Not interested, moving on."" I rarely go ""I'm not going to use this because it probably won't get enough users to last.""<p>I'm glad to hear that going with startup technologies is going well for you, but the danger seems just as big.

However, because the government is so far in debt to begin with, adding debt through stimulus is guaranteed to be unpopular. The application of Keynesian policy deserves some dumping. When times get crappy its spend spend spend and lower interest rates, when times are booming its...maintain current monetary and lower interest rates? It seems they are only following Keynesian theory when times get tough. For political reasons, they are conveniently leaving out the difficult parts of application of Keynesian theory. Overspending and bad policy during times of plenty causes grief during times of trouble. From what I see, misapplication, including uncalled for low interest rates, deserves some blame.<p>Banks made bad loans (also) because their loans were risk free. They were leveraging because they could. I agree they shoulder the blame, but so do the guarantors of those loans, US Government.<p>Thanks again for the replies... I copied this and will review it several more times to further my understanding. I was obviously misguided.<p>I consider myself someone centrist, but I certainly lean towards limited government. Such talk of nationalizing banks to me is dangerous in the long term. I'm not even sure how that would be considered constitutional. But in our situation, hell, they are basically all quasi nationalized anyway. The current structure allows far worse in that only losses are nationalized. So our choice under current policy is to nationalize or recapitalize? We need better options and policy that allows for banks to fail when they make bad loans. But again, can Keynesian theory even be successfully applied in this environment? Dont we basically have to have smaller banks or national banks in order for it to work? \nI agree with the idea that banks should be broken up. The TBTF are alive and well and bigger than ever. That is one of the #OWS grievances I can get behind.

""But we need them"", the home owners said. ""No you don't,"" the developers replied. The residents have grown accustomed to it and use buckets and sinks instead.<p>The house has no Windows, so you can't see the Real World. After spending years saying ""You don't need to do that,"" the Developer finally responds that you can hang pictures on the wall of what the idealized Real World looks like. They offer to also sell you a second home over in the Windows development area, but you're either squatting or paying full price for it.<p>Recently, the Developer replaced nearly every front door in the community with a garage door. ""It gives you faster access to everything!"" he explains. It opens seemingly at random, and looks nothing like the rest of the house. It's uncharacteristically gaudy. Most of the residents hide it or pretend it isn't there.<p>Every street in the development is named after cats, but there's no sequential logic to it. When the ISP explains ""You need to live north of Tiger to get high speed internet"" in their ads, most people have to pull out a map to figure out if they can. People have taken to numbering the streets, but those numbers aren't written on the street signs. Fortunately, it's relatively easy and cheap to move to another street, but in most cases nothing changes. The residents claim they know the order, but when anyone comes to visit from out of town, they are confused and quickly lost, since most of the streets look the same anyway.<p>Every 18 months or so, many of the residents bulldoze their entire home and replace it. They look down on those who don't. If someone hasn't bought a house recently enough, the developer won't even bring over new furniture, and the street cleaner begins skipping their house.<p>All the cars a elegant and beautiful works of glass, wrapped in large, often gaudy rubber bumpers. Some people even cover their entire car in a bumper (except the windshield, which gets a gummy sticker). Early buyers of the glass car need the bumpers to cover a hole where fuel leaks out, but for most, it's because the glass cars might shatter.<p>But all the residents of the Orchard are happy. They're a bit stuck up about how much their homes cost, despite that most people living in the ""other"" complex could easily afford it. They write long missives in their local paper about how bad it is to live in the other community, how they ""just don't get it"". They believe the home that suited them is clearly the best choice for everyone, even businesses. The talk with pride about how much money their Developer makes, even bragging that he has the highest margins in the industry, and wear their credit card debt as a badge of pride. To everyone else, they're an odd but mostly harmless group. But in their echo chamber, they're the smartest, most progressive, most intelligent and affluent people in the world, for whom the defining characteristic of their life is who they bought their house from.<p>And somewhere, off in the hills, the Unix monastery (which designed and constructed much of the infrastructure for the Orchard, free of charge, for the betterment of everyone) lives in hand-built homes, constantly adjusted and tailored to their needs and whims, and occasionally stripped down to the foundation and rebuilt just for fun.",1318616345

According to this author CERN already did this, so it's entirely irrelevant to the discussion - I couldn't verify this, because it's not mentioned in the CERN paper he referenced.<p>1) What they did not do (according to this paper) is account for the fact that in the satellite frame, during the neutrino's flight the receiver station was moving towards the source.<p>2) time = distance / rate<p>3) CERN used rate = c, but they should have used rate = c + v because the receiver station was moving towards the neutrino.<p>That is quite literally the entire thing, check the math in the paper if you don't believe me.  This is not a claim that CERN somehow misapplied special relativity, it's a claim that they simply forgot to include the motion of the receiver.<p>IMO this is far too elementary a mistake to have been missed for this long, so I'm suspicious. The CERN paper that the author references (<a href=""http://arxiv.org/pdf/1109.4897v1"" rel=""nofollow"">http://arxiv.org/pdf/1109.4897v1</a>) doesn't discuss relativistic corrections at all, so I don't know why the author assumes this mistake has been made, perhaps he's reading another paper that he didn't reference? From the OPERA one that he links (though I haven't read it in too much detail) I get the sense that if it was this simple, one of the many calibration tests that they've done would have easily caught the error (they talk about a lot of bidirectional synchronization stuff), so for now, at least, I would take this with a grain of salt.",1318616039

At some point that starts harming adoption levels of new products.<p>Edit to comment below:<p>""Trying and failing is a far better outcome than never having tried at all"" is a great mantra for individuals or even small startups, but I am not sure how it applies here. I am still bitter over Google abandoning Notebook (which I was quite a heavy user of) and canning Calendar Public Search (search!!). I then reluctantly allowed my team to use Wave, only to have that one canned after building a process around it. No, it is not better for me that they tried and <i>changed their minds</i> (they did NOT ""fail""\n technically), because I could have picked another product at the time that did intend to stick around.<p>People look at Google, with all the money and people that it has, and ask ""How much could it POSSIBLY cost to keep Code Search going? How is it possible that Google can't afford it?"". The only answer I can come up with is (1) It can afford it (2) But it doesn't care to.<p>So sure, if you are happy to see Google launch stuff that it has no commitment to, great for you. I'm having better luck taking chances with startups and their products. At least they have skin in the game.<p>Edit #2: @joebadmo - but that is exactly what I think when I see a new Google product - ""will it reach such large levels of adoption so that Google will keep it"". And I keep getting it wrong - even for products like Wave and Code Search which I thought <i>surely</i> they are used internally and so will be kept around if only because of that - nope, either they are not used internally (if not, why not?) or even that is not protection enough.<p>Sure, startups and small-person concerns are also risky propositions, but let's not forget the numbers. 100,000 users are a ""failure"" for google, but they are a wild success for a small startup, at least the ones not looking for a big exit. If you inlcude app writers as ""startups"", their longevity is phenomenal - I have never had an app stop working on me because somebody turned a sever off somewhere.

By forcing Windows users to make the switch to Metro (which is <i>completely</i> different than explorer.exe), Microsoft is going to create a lot of user backlash - it's a completely different computing experience than what Windows users have come to expect.<p>What Apple gets that Microsoft doesn't is that, while both agree that simpler, more elegant UIs are the future of computing, you can't just force an entrenched desktop user to switch to a mobile interface overnight.

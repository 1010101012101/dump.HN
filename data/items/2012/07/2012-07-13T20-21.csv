4241872,comment,4240007,4240586,14,0,marcamillion,,,"I agree with some of this...with a key proviso. They are not 'die-hard unfettered market proselytizers'. For instance, they strongly favor ""Obama Care"" - maybe not in its entirety and in the EXACT way that it has turned out, but they generally favor the idea of a government created program that creates an exchange for all insurance companies to compete for everybody. They also acknowledge, as the law does, that in order for more people to get coverage and the cost of health care to be tamed, the number of uninsureds has to be decreased significantly - including using fines and subsidies.<p>That stance is quint-essential Economist, based on my experience of reading them cover to cover - weekly - for the last 5 years.<p>They do have a free-market, lightly-regulated bias...but they are pragmatic when they need to be, and for that I love them.<p>Without getting into too much politics, people tend to forget how nuanced the 'Iraq War' decision was at the time. Obama has done a good job of summarizing it into a nice 'sound byte'. The war in Iraq is a ""dumb war"". The notion there that the outcome was so obvious that it shouldn't have been chosen. What many forget is that post-9/11, the intelligence community was indeed split. The UN SEC actually voted in favor of stricter sanctions and harsher actions against Saddam - if he didn't publicly state that he had no WMDs.<p>It's easy to say Bush knew there were no WMDs in Iraq and he was going there just for oil, but that's a cynical (and non-nuanced view) of the context of the time.<p>As Peter Bergen pointed out in his latest book Man Hunt, the decision for Obama to go to Abbottabad for Bin Laden was based on more circumstantial evidence than the decision for Bush to go to Iraq. Granted, the operations were different in scale - but that alone speaks to the fact that the decision to go to Iraq was supported by faulty intelligence.<p>Assuming that Bush had mal-intent and ""knew"" there were no WMD in Iraq - but was going just to avenge his father or w/e other story (disregarding everything else) is ridiculous at best.<p>One simple question I always pose to people when they make such statements about Iraq is...if Bush knew there were no WMDs in Iraq, why would he use that as a pretext when he would obviously be either right or wrong? It's not as if they can ""plant"" WMDs. It's either they will find it, or not. There is no middle ground.<p>So either he will be a hero, or he will be zero. He staked his entire presidency on that decision. He knew that when the presidency is done, he would just have his legacy. His entire legacy would be defined by that decision. There is no way, any rational president/person would make such a decision lightly and frivolously.<p>He would have been better off using the fact that Saddam has slaughtered hundreds of thousands of Kurds, or something else that is more 'ambiguous' that he can't REALLY be held accountable for.<p>Finding WMDs is a key tangible accountability metric.<p>So the fact The Economist was also a proponent of the Iraq War is just further proof as to the ambiguity in the intelligence community at the time of the decision - and how difficult such a decision was.",1342213194

Easier said than done. Unless that massive lobbying investment (or at least a publicity campaign, like SOPA boycotts) happen the entrenched interests win by default and lots of peer-to-peer transactions will move to gray/black market.<p>Prohibition always creates speakeasies and the organized crime to protect them.<p>EDIT: To address ""devil advocates"", yes, most regulation mandated and enforced by government is a terrible imposition. Self-regulation that preserves consumer choice is a much better idea. You want to pay extra $$$ for a better level of service / protection /etc?

4241858,comment,4241669,4241669,27,0,DanielBMarkham,,,"Just about every year for as long as I can remember, my family has taken a summer vacation at a beach about 300 miles away. We always stay in a hotel.<p>Over time, the beach has gotten tacky. Big billboards. Lots of nightlife. Amusement park rides. All kinds of things that reek of Las Vegas, but not so much a relaxing family vacation.<p>So this year we decided to try something different. I got onto VRBO online and picked out a beach house 1000 miles away in Florida. The owner included pictures, and there were lots of references and reviews for me to assess risk beforehand. I sent them a check -- which they could have cashed and absconded with -- and we drove down on the day scheduled.<p>It was the best beach vacation we've ever had. In addition, it was half or a third as much as our previous vacations.<p>Vested interests can fight as much as they want, but this is a done deal: people own their stuff and they're damn well liable to do what they want to with it. If I can sell you a 8-passenger airplane without warranty, you can certainly come stay at my house for an night or two. Laws which were used to increase the quality of hotel stays back in 1890 have extremely little applicability today.<p>I don't know if we're going to use the same house again this year -- the owner was magnificent, and I'm not about to share where it was! -- but I know that we'll be sticking to this model for a good while.",1342213030

(While technically true, it is mean. Much like calling me <i>whitey</i> is technically true as I am white... it is generally an insult.) If not for that, the use of phrases like ""well that was retarded"" would still be legit uses since it is in spirit of the original meaning and not too far from saying ""well, that was stupid"". One could even argue that in a slightly less PC world we could still be using it to describe things and actions... just not people. But that is wishful thinking. The damage has been done.<p>Side note: It is some what also the case with the word ""gay"" which used to just mean ""happy"". Although, when people say ""well, that was gay"" they are generally not meaning ""happy"" so we've pretty much departed from that.

Are you going to argue that he should form a less efficient team in the name of diversity?<p>>Splitting your time between coding and test coverage is an extremely poor analogy to inclusivity in software. For one, your time is a resource, software is output. If you split 8 (wo)man hours into 8 hours testing and 0 hours coding, your output goes down; if you add 8 (wo)man hours to a software project, your output goes up. Even more importantly, coding and testing are not people, they don't have feelings, children to feed, etc. The comparison simply doesn't apply.<p>You've misunderstood; my point is not that by focussing on testing you take away from coding. My point is that, while a low test coverage number indicates a problem, if you just focus on the coverage number you can end up doing more harm to the problem you were trying to fix.<p>The post I replied to was saying ""look, if only 4% of OSS developers are female then clearly that indicates some problem.""

When you say ""It isn't a theory propagated during the crisis, it's a theory substantiated by the crisis,"" I can see why you think that.  It doesn't mean I don't think you're wrong.  I do.  And I do think it's a talking point - you write as if this was all settled, and it's not.<p>And my point about economics as a pseudo science was really a long winded way of saying your assertion that ""my dyed in the wool republican finance teacher/boss spoke about how glass steagal was grudgingly useful, before the crisis hit""  carries the same intellectual weight as ""The guy who runs the local sandwich shop has a sister whose brick-layer husband think glass steagal is useful""",1342210697

I'm a member here, but am using a throwaway ID - because I'm sure there'll be a backlash to what I am going to reveal.<p>Now I want to state for the record, I actually like Facebook, I don't have an axe to grind, and I really believe that MZ's intentions are truly honorable. I would like to believe he knows nothing about this, but I'm not nave - he owns 57%, and he's a very very clever man. But I am disappointed.<p>So to explain...<p>Because the BBC has a wide non-tech audience some of what was found was not fully revealed mainly because it's so difficult to explain to the general public the tech behind this issues raised.<p>The main point was missed both by TechCrunch, and many commentators on Twitter etc. and I guess general fans of Facebook. The point being that at first the ads were targeted to UK and US people. Hardly any clicks were reported meaning that advertising with this targeted criteria is pointless, and in fact more pointless than expanding the reach to countries that will artificially boost your return. The clicks/likes though high in number will never bear fruit, that much is not disputed by the BBC. But it begs the question if both ""settings"" are useless then what's the point in spending any money at all with Facebook?<p>Before I get a barrage of hate mail remember I had access to the real data. The BBC describes exactly how you can replicate the experiment for yourself, and I guarantee you'll find the same results. What's more you'll discover the same profiles are liking your fake page the same as they liked the BBCs virtualbagel. Take it from me.<p>What's more the list of Likers contained people who appear to spend their lives clicking likes. These people are clicking between 50-100 likes per day, all day, every day. In the 10 or so days in July many had racked up literally 300-1500 clicks. It doesn't take a genius to work out these people are being paid to click on ads.<p>Remember we're talking third world countries where it makes economic sense to pay someone a-dollar-a-day to click on ads all day, when the return is so massive.<p>The question is who is paying? Who really stands to benefit? Logically it just can't be a third party. This is out-and-out click-fraud.<p>In addition to all this, and I can't reveal too much (because it's still being investigated for later publication) is that there appears to be evidence that the process is also subject to some automation from within Facebook. We have comparative evidence that shows how click automation would look if it was carried out by a third party and how it would look if it was carried out inside Facebook. Unfortunately for Facebook the evidence is showing that again it's driven from the inside.<p>I'm actually quite sad, because it doesn't have to be this way, but from what I have analysed it is, what it is. If you don't believe me do the same exercise and look at the data.",1342210670

No. In the inverse example, we don't put extra load on servers in anticipation that load goes up, just so we can dump the extra load and put it back to where it would have been had we not had extra load. The idea is moronic. It is literally the same as putting lead in your servers until you have to dump it, just because you can. Real admins have alerts on their servers to tell them when they will need additional capacity.<p>Incidentally, fuel dump systems were initially added due to a rule by the FAA that a plane's structural landing weight not be exceeded by its takeoff weight. Many commercial planes never had this problem, so dumping systems were not installed. As a result, most planes just circle until they've burned up enough fuel, or land anyway overweight. You could dump fuel to lessen the chance of explosion, but only if your plane is equipped with a fuel dump system, and such incidents are so rare it's not even a safety consideration.",1342210602

How might that change WolframAlpha, and what new challenges does it raise?<p>Wolfram: We know that we can do scarily well at computing things about people. When you look up someone on the web, its noisy and messy. But by combining different data sources  particularly in the United States, where many sources are publicly available  we can pretty much nail a precise report about a particular person. For the time being, we have decided not to do it because the bad appears to outweigh the good. I feel somewhat squeamish about it. My guess is that it will eventually happen, but its not a trail I want to blaze.<p>-----------------------------------",1342209745

They are straight forward docs for developer, and the prospect that the complete site is on github itself is a +1. I had some troubles with Cors support recently, and found it part of the spec within two clicks from their main portal. Try to<p>a) Keep headings readable (nothing fancy) and un-ambiguous. Don't make me wonder whether I have to go to Authorization or Authentication for instance.<p>b) Document everything. Even small nuances that you feel are implied. The API specs should change before your API changes.<p>c) Give me an archived version somewhere. This is easier if you just release your docs as a repo on github. This <i>really</i> helps people out. I ended up converting the parse.com documentation to markdown just to get an offline, readable version for myself.",1342209714

If you want to combat a study you need to do so with another one, not by just saying throwing out untested assumptions.<p>Yeah. Combat the studies that you totally provided the link to. Throwing claims around saying ""scientists say that"" or ""studies have proved that"" is surely not how it works.<p>> Thanks for the condescension.<p>What part was condescending?

""Could I be working less, get paid more for the same work or get to work on something more fun for the same money?""<p>Once you start thinking of work as money paid per boring hour, then compensation takes on a different perspective. The solution to the money problem may be to work for a start-up (high variance, high EV, potentially low amount of boring hours, or high amount, depending on the startup:)), a big company that lets you work on interesting problems (less variance, low amount of boring hours), working in banking (high amount of boring hours, high return) or whatever else you think is an optimal solution for you, but at least you realise that it is about how you optimise for the problem that matters, not what someone else comes out with compensation-wise (he may be trading a high amount of boring hours for high compensation, or he may have gotten lucky on a high variance route).",1315993812

You can look at something and say ""that's evil, so I won't do it"".  Sure, sometimes that can cause you hardship, but you deal with it.  Maybe evil is an uncountable, but you don't need to count it.  You just passively avoid options that are evil.<p>Doing good is harder.  You have to actively seek out and choose good things to do from a huge set.  That means attempting to enumerate at least part of that set.  You have to figure out how to actually do those things.

On like day 5 of working on this idea, you'll want to start sharing/saving some PDFs or excel sheets or something.  Ideally you'd be able to create a new Dropbox for this project and run two clients on your machine, one for your personal Dropbox and one for your new project Dropbox, and Joe can do the same.<p>But because you can't run two clients at once, you can't do this.  You can create ""Personal"" and ""Project"" folders in your existing Dropbox and sync to different machines, but Joe now needs to use your Dropbox account and he can't sync his personal account.  Or you both use the web client, except you're basically using FreeDrive from 1999.  Or you use an entirely different file sharing service like ZumoDrive, which is kind of silly.<p>I get that multi-client support for Dropbox is probably a niche feature and will probably lead to jerks like me using 5 accounts instead of 1, so they don't do it.  And there are workarounds like Dropboxen that allow me to sort of have multiple Dropbox instances running on my machine if I have multiple user accounts.

Who then could have green vegetables in the middle of a snowy winter, yet now anyone can buy canned vegetables.<p>My point is that the things you talk about occur because it's <i>cheap</i>. Can you find a house these days without complete plumbing? 15 years ago I helped a friend buy a used car for $600, which he could afford on US $11,000 per year as a graduate student.<p>Oddly enough, people <i>with</i> money don't a dishwasher or complete kitchen, because they can eat out. Money gives options.<p>In any case, you and the previous poster state that the definition of poverty used in the census is variable. The aforelinked definition is one of two definitions of poverty used by the US, specifically, this is the one used to determine who can participate in assistance programs. You can see that it's defined by the CPI, with no way to be flexible about it, unless a given State wants to raise it by at most 25%.<p>This is because the US definition is, contrary to with you both say, an absolute definition. Quoting from Wikipedia:<p>Since the 1960s, the United States Government has defined poverty in absolute terms. When the Johnson administration declared ""war on poverty"" in 1964, it chose an absolute measure. The ""absolute poverty line"" is the threshold below which families or individuals are considered to be lacking the resources to meet the basic needs for healthy living; having insufficient income to provide the food, shelter and clothing needed to preserve health.<p>This in turn is based on the CPI, and aside from a few minor changes ""the U.S. government's approach to measuring poverty has remained static for the past forty years.""<p>In other words, you and the previous poster are incorrect.",1315991749

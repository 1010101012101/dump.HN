Like Steve on Startups:<p>“The problem with the Internet startup craze isn’t that too many people are starting companies; it’s that too many people aren’t sticking with it. That’s somewhat understandable, because there are many moments that are filled with despair and agony, when you have to fire people and cancel things and deal with very difficult situations. That’s when you find out who you are and what your values are.<p>“So when these people sell out, even though they get fabulously rich, they’re gypping themselves out of one of the potentially most rewarding experiences of their unfolding lives. Without it, they may never know their values or how to keep their newfound wealth in perspective.” [Fortune, Jan. 24, 2000]",1314230092

2923105,comment,2922336,2922946,5,0,dxbydt,,,"> it helps to have an understanding of the mechanics<p>My claim is the exact opposite. I claim you don't need to understand the mechanics ( just blindly abide by the rules of the group or abelian group or finite simple group or whatever), which is why the approach is better. If you show a monkey red means stop and green means go and reinforce these rules by rewarding with a banana, eventually the monkey will stop when he sees the red. Not because he understands the mechanics of traffic management. Simply because he is abiding by the rules. Similarly, large portions of math can be approached by either the definitional route ( ie. rules ie. define propositions & theorems that logically follow if those props held ) or via trying to understand actual mechanics by mapping everything to real world phenomena ( x = distance, dx/dt = velocity, d/dt(dx/dt) = acceleration etc. ) which are problematic because the mapping breaks down  due to the nature of physical reality ( like friction etc. )<p>How would one explain say Hilbert's 7th problem via the actual mechanics ?<p>If a is algebraic and b is irrational show a^b is transcendental.<p>What does that even mean when you map them to the real world ? Instead, the solution is to build upon theorems that logically follow from the axioms you start out with.\nProblem:\n<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hilbert%27s_seventh_problem"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hilbert%27s_seventh_problem</a>\nSolution:\n<a href=""http://terrytao.wordpress.com/2011/08/21/hilberts-seventh-problem-and-powers-of-2-and-3/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://terrytao.wordpress.com/2011/08/21/hilberts-seventh-pr...</a>",1314229076

Your argument seems to be that we should expect companies to behave exactly as badly as the law can possibly let them do so and that they should receive no reproach for doing that.   If you use this argument then you are implying that the law should enforce good behavior in every single thing every company does, since there is no other force to make them do good things (remember, you just argued that nobody should complain about what Apple does because it is legal).<p>Clearly the above is ridiculous and the whole premise of ""free"" societies is that people and companies are granted wide freedom to do things and the law only regulates the most severe of these and that <i>people</i> will motivate good behavior by each other and companies by shaming them and judging them and refusing to deal with them when they behave poorly.<p>So yes - when Apple behaves badly they <i>need</i> to feel judgement from the community and this is how it happens.  The company does something bad (suing over a frivolous feature to block an entire competitor's product), and we express surprise and shock that it did such a bad thing.",1314228866

I've always seen Jobs as a visionary leader, but I'm uncertain he's been similarly effective at grooming a leadership team (or individual) with the same vision. Cult of personality and all that.<p>Part of Apple's success, IMHO, has been Jobs' ability to cut through bureaucracy, egos, corporate politics and industry politics to execute on a pristine vision. Perhaps it's my lack of faith in middle managers, but unless there is a clear mandate from leadership, details & priorities can morph down the chain of command. Visionary products can be diluted by others making what seem like perfectly sound trade-offs. It's the minimization of that dilution, setting of crystal-clear priorities, and making the hard trade-off decisions that has made Jobs such an effective leader at Apple.<p>That, and his ability to look several steps ahead of an industry - and arguably to create new industries - that has given rise to so many of Apple's disruptive innovations. Without him, I have a bad feeling Apple will become better at creating sustaining innovations than disruptive ones.<p>Of course, I don't work there and perhaps there are many others who can make such tough decisions and dream up industry-changing visions.

He assumes the purpose is entirely utilitarian. He implicitly says math should be about solving common real-world problems, like his concocted life-insurance premium minimization, which helps the common student make life decisions (as if!). While 100% of pure math folks would actively disagree with him, even 99% of applied math folk would have a tough time agreeing with his utilitarian mindset. We simply don't do math to just pay the bills. People were trisecting angles and squaring the circle and computing surds for over thousands of years with no utilitarian aspect whatsoever. He also says math problems must be rephrased as CS programming problems!!!

These areas can be actually affordable for people living on an intern's salary, with rents that are significantly cheaper than a comparable apartment in other districts. They also have some of the best food and dive bars you can find in the city at amazing prices. Go get Mexican anywhere south of 24th, Pakistani on Post, or breakfast at Dottie's on Jones and tell me I'm wrong. The neighborhoods are also close to public transit, the more interesting parts of the city (the TL is right next to Union Square for instance), and the offices of a lot of startups.<p>I lived in the middle of the Tenderloin (Hyde and Ellis) for 14 months and my startup's office is currently a block from ""the most dangerous corner in the city"" (Mission and 6th). My girlfriend lived in the deep Mission from age 6-10. I find I'm accosted for change significantly less often in the TL compared to the ""richer"" areas of the city. The way it seems to me, the homeless and drug addicted that frequent the TL are ""at home"" when there, when they ""go to work"" they head to the touristy areas where people have money to ask for.<p>The time I've spent in the TL has also been a great learning experience with regards to understanding less fortunate people. I've had a lot of really interesting (and quite a few rather weird) interactions with drug addicts, prostitutes, and homeless. They really aren't a group that needs to be feared. They're just people trying to figure out a way to live with the cards they were dealt and a lot really appreciate the chance to talk to someone and tell their story. Its how I learned heroin dealers don't accept coins.<p>These more gritty areas of the city aren't nearly as dangerous as people make them out to be. Yes, if you walk down a back alley without assessing beforehand you might run into a bad situation, but this is true anywhere in the city. Being street-smart is a necessary skill no matter where you live in SF. The illegal activity that occurs in these areas (drugs/prostitution) doesn't and won't involve you if you don't get involved with it.<p>I know I'm rambling and waxing philosophical, but I find myself regularly defending these neighborhoods cause people just don't give them a chance.

2922948,comment,2922336,2922524,2,0,dataduck,,,"Not entirely fair.  While there is a lot of choice about how to define stuff around the edges of mathematics, after the axiomatic choices have been made, there's quite a lot to discover in their structure.  Particularly if the relevant axioms relate to something outside of mathematics (the examples are too many to even scratch but start out thinking of the definitions of natural and rational numbers) then you really are discovering things in the same way as a physicist - in fact, this is how many physicists go about discovering things, for better or worse.<p>In most situations it makes sense to define exponentiation as repeated multiplication, and a^0 as the absence of multiplication by a, hence a^0 = 1 as the multiplicative identity.  I wouldn't introduce the idea of anything else to a student unless they specifically asked me about one of the problems which can arise in choosing 0^0 = 1.",1314227034

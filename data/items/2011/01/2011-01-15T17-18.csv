At that scale, when 2TB drives become the most economical to buy that does not mean one immediately dives in and replaces all the 1.5TB drives. You have to do a bit more math than that.<p>It's also hard to tell whether they're actively decommissioning their 1TB drives or if they've just on a growth curve and they've done significantly more business while 1.5TB and 2TB drives were the more economical choice, but sooner or later the cost/benefit curves do cross and you do want to start decommissioning the smaller drives, it's only a matter of time.",1295114348

The other stuff comes too, but experienced pentesters who enjoy their job see the world in a completely different way to a lot of people. When you see a shiny new piece of tech, a pentester's already thinking about how to jailbreak it and what they want to do with it afterwards. There's a specific mindset for a good pentester. Not all penetration testers have it, but you can spot the ones that do a mile off.<p>I dare say that this mindset exists amongst programmers too, particularly those that have done a lot of debugging or TDD.

This equals 1+z+Exp(z,2)+Exp(z,3)+... (by hypothesis, ajp1=p1 for all aj), which is just a geometric series with total 1/(1-z).<p>(+) So A(z) = 1/(sqrt(1-z)) = Exp(1-z,-1/2). Using binomial theorem, this equals<p>Sum(n=0..infinity) of (-1/2 choose n [binomial coefficient])Exp(-z,n).<p>an=(-1/2 choose n)<i>Exp(-1,n)<p>E.g. a3= (-1/2 - 3/2 - 5/2)/(3 </i> 2 * 1) * Exp(-1,n) = (1+3+5) / (2 * 3!), which is the result we had above at ( ^ ).<p>( ^^^ ) We know p1+p2+p3+p4+p5+p6=1 as the dice are six-sided. This gives p1p1<i>(a0+a1+...+a5) = 1 (see ( ^^ )). So what's a0+a1+...+a5?<p>Take A(z)(1+z+Exp(z,2)+...) = a0+(a0+a1)z+(a0+a1+a2)Exp(z,2)+... . Let's call this S1 + S2z + S3z + ... . Then we want to find S6 = a0 + ... + a5. Remember that p1p1s6=1 from ( ^^^ ).<p>Well by (+) A(z)(1+z+Exp(z,2)+...)=Exp(1-z,-1/2) (1+z+Exp(z,2)=Exp(1-z,-1/2) Exp(1-z,-1).

The - signs cancel out again.<p>Let's work out the values of Sn: S1=1, S2=a0+a1=3/2, S3=a0+a1+a2=15/8=3/2 * 5/4 ... and S6=3/2 * 5/4 * 7/6 * 9/8 * 11/10.<p>Picture here:<p><pre><code>  6zzzzzz

This is meant to be symmetric around x=y. Each different character represents a different total. All these areas are the ones we've been trying to make the same: ""."" is the probability of getting a total of two on two dice. ""#"" is the probability of a 3 total, and so on. It gets closer and closer to a circle.<p>So this is the link to the circle. If n is the area shown in the diagram above, we have n approx= (pi/4) Exp(Sn,2), since this is a quarter of a circle with radius Sn. We want to prove the circle goes through the rectangles just outside the edge, if so we can show that n - 1 < (pi/4) Exp(Sn,2) < n + 1   (!)  . This is because we are setting the area of each total (i.e 2..7) to be 1, so adding an extra total (which looks more and more like a circle as n gets bigger) will just add one to the total, and we are going to prove an ideal circle would go through the outer rim (e.g. the ""z""s in the diagram above).<p>Let's look at some examples.<p>Exp(S6,2) = Exp(3/2,2) * Exp(5/4,2) * Exp(7/6,2) * Exp(9/8,2) * Exp(11/10,2) from above.<p>Exp(S9,2) = Exp(s6,2) * Exp(13/12,2) * Exp(15/14,2) * Exp(17,16,2)<p>Note Exp(1+1/2k,2)=1+ 1/k + 1/(4<i>Exp(k,2)) > 1 + 1/k<p>So Exp(S9,2) > Exp(S6,2) (1+1/6)(1+1/7)(1+1/8) = Exp(S6,2)(7/6)(8/7)(9/8)=Exp(S6,2)(9/6) by cancelling. He also proves that Exp(S9,2) < Exp(S6,2)</i>(8/5).<p>In general Exp(Sa,2)<i>(a+b)/a < Exp(s(a+b),2) < Exp(Sa,2)</i>((a+b-1)/(a-1)). From this inequality (ineq), he can prove his result on the approximate value of Sn, (!) above.<p>He wants the circle of radius S6 to go outside the inner most notches in the diagram (between "" and z in the diagram above). Note that these coordinates (S5,S1), (S4,S2), ... . By Pythagoras we want Exp(Sk,2) + Exp(S(n-k),2) < Exp(Sn,2) < Exp(Sk, 2) + Exp(S(n+1-k),2), this follows from his inequality (ineq) above.<p>(Incidentally you can do the same construction with 3 dice forming a ball, there is a picture at 56:00 which I won't try to reproduce in ascii.)<p>---<p>So we now have a relationship between Sn and Pi, Sn approx= 4n/Pi. Also Sn is a sum of values of an, which are just (1/2) (3/4) ... (2n-1/2n). Finally Sn=2n<i>an (not quite sure why??). From all this we can get an=1/(Sqrt(Pi</i>n).<p>The number an is famous in connection with a random walk of length n. The probability of flipping a coin 2n times and getting equal number of heads and tails is an. This probability is (2n choose n)/Exp(2,2n). But (2n choose n) is just ((2n) (2n-1) ... 1) / (n! n!), which is just an an above.<p>Rather than a coin, he takes the binary digits of pi/4 as heads and tails:<p><pre><code>   .11001001...

We know Sum(ak, a(n-k))=1.<p>This is equivalent to (apparently!)
Sum((2k choose k) * (2n-2k choose n-k)=Exp(n,4)<p>(A digression here on ""balanced random walks"" and the links to 2d barcodes like QR-codes. You decompose a finite random sequence of bits like the bits of pi, into two parts. The first part is the sequence up to the last point the sequence crosses the origin, this part is balanced.

It used to mean that a new version of software contained new features on top of those you already had but lately there has been a push to remove things that are viewed as used by only a small percentage of the user base.  Sadly many of those things are used by the more 'advanced' segment of the user base.<p>FF4 is removing the RSS icon and also the bottom status bar which are the two that irk me.  Not just turning off, removing entirely.  The status bar functionality has to be restored by a plug-in now, which only serves to bog the browser down.  The RSS functionality I'm sure will be the same but again, more plugins to replace what was native functionality.<p>I fully understand catering to the bulk of the market but this should apply to default settings, not removing features entirely.

If you can't write your own compiler are you a non-programmer? This is an unanswerable question.<p>Maybe we could focus on kinds of thinking that help you program well. There is nothing you can't learn eventually. However, we might find some common ground by looking at how good programmers have trained their minds.<p>We can list some desirable skills for a programmer that reach across languages and tools. There is an old saw by Joel on Software that some people just can't understand pointers and recursion. Or on the next level, that some people can't understand multithreaded/parallel programming. I think I'd say that an instinct for simplicity or mathematical beauty and symmetry also plays a role in making good designs. In other words, making not just consistent mental models that you can simulate in your head (as another comment says), but making beautiful ones.<p>I was sitting with my manager yesterday. He was giving me requirements for a system I'll have to build over the next two weeks. Along the way we came across a problem where we need to take a bunch of multidimensional values and combine them together.<p>Instead of leaving it to me, he wanted to design it on the spot. He thought of this like voting where each value makes some contribution, but then the requirements dictated that we needed to add things like ""some values have more votes than others"", and ""some votes have veto power"".<p>As he was describing this pseudo-consensus algorithm with weights and vetos, I was surprised he didn't know how ugly this design sounded. It is hard to set up the contribution of each value, hard to predict the behavior, and hard to make intuitive.<p>It's not that this is a bad, uncreative idea. Voting is an interesting analogy for the problem, and intuition is a good way to take a stab at a problem. It's that when he started working it out he didn't see the multiplying problems, or the counterexamples that would cause trouble for his system. And I do think this is something that good programmers and system designers do well, even without much conscious thinking. They find the attack surface, figure out where their abstraction leaks, jump immediately to edge cases.<p>I'm going to have to pull him back early next week. :oD<p>You don't have to say that the programmer has a magic switch in their brain that enabled them to be a genius while everyone else is left out.

2107310,comment,2106927,2106927,0,0,wallflower,,,"> Now I will go on with my own experience as a youngster in mathematics. Another thing that my father told me--and I can't quite explain it, because it was more an emotion than a telling--was that the ratio of the circumference to the diameter of all circles was always the same, no matter what the size. That didn't seem to me too unobvious, but the ratio had some marvelous property. That was a wonderful number, a deep number, pi. There was a mystery about this number that I didn't quite understand as a youth, but this was a great thing, and the result was that I looked for pi everywhere.<p>When I was learning later in school how to make the decimals for fractions, and how to make 3 1/8, 1 wrote 3.125 and, thinking I recognized a friend, wrote that it equals pi, the ratio of circumference to diameter of a circle. The teacher corrected it to 3.1416.<p>I illustrate these things to show an influence. The idea that there is a mystery, that there is a wonder about the number was important to me--not what the number was. Very much later, when I was doing experiments in the laboratory--I mean my own home laboratory, fiddling around--no, excuse me, I didn't do experiments, I never did; I just fiddled around. Gradually, through books and manuals, I began to discover there were formulas applicable to electricity in relating the current and resistance, and so on. One day, looking at the formulas in some book or other, I discovered a formula for the frequency of a resonant circuit, which was f = 1/2 pi LC, where L is the inductance and C the capacitance of the... circle? You laugh, but I was very serious then. Pi was a thing with circles, and here is pi coming out of an electric circuit. Where was the circle? Do those of you who laughed know how that comes about?<p>I have to love the thing. I have to look for it. I have to think about it. And then I realized, of course, that the coils are made in circles. About a half year later, I found another book which gave the inductance of round coils and square coils, and there were other pi's in those formulas. I began to think about it again, and I realized that the pi did not come from the circular coils. I understand it better now; but in my heart I still don't know where that circle is, where that pi comes from.<p>-Richard Feynman<p>""What is Science?""<p>1966 Lecture<p><a href=""http://www.fotuva.org/feynman/what_is_science.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.fotuva.org/feynman/what_is_science.html</a>",1295112150

From what little I know about the VC business, I believe the problem isn't that the money doesn't scale to make lots of small investments. The problem is that people's time doesn't scale. Fred Wilson can't keep up with all his emails, and adding more people to the firm isn't going to solve the problem. On the other hand, although having a public ""VC"" firm like a public stock market would solve this problem in a great way (""invest in the startups you're interested in""), the SEC enforces laws to prevent willy-nilly selling shares to the public (blue sky laws an all that). Makes sense.<p>So that's why we have sites like KickStarter and I think you will see a lot more of that kind of thing going on to fund entrepreneurs in the next 5-10 years. Which is a good thing, IMHO.<p>I have a few ideas along these lines, but no money to execute them at the moment.

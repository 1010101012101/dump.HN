5123596,comment,5120400,5122260,3,0,danenania,,,"The argument may not have been stated as well as it could have, but your response reduces to emotional scapegoating what is really a valid concern.<p>Let's say that during America's period of slavery, there was an extremely wealthy northeastern industrialist who donated a large portion of his wealth to improve the living conditions of slaves. He wanted them to have better food, better clothes, better medical care, etc. But even though his wealth was gained by legitimate free enterprise and not slavery, he had never called for the outright abolition of slavery, just lamented the poor living conditions of the slaves.<p>The industrialist's contribution should certainly be applauded, as it would certainly do good, but without addressing the fundamental injustice, it only makes a system predicated on vast suffering slightly more tolerable.<p>In short, hoping for the winners of a corrupt system to save the losers is foolish. If we had real free markets and real democracy, it might be a different story, but we don't. Our situation cannot be remedied by charity, welfare, or incremental reforms. We need fundamental structural transformation of our political and economic institutions. Anything short, however noble the aim, is equivalent to trying to make slaves more comfortable without freeing them.",1359273481

5123594,comment,5123022,5123022,8,0,ChristianMarks,,,"My experience working as a scientific programmer is this: my colleagues aren't forthcoming. I could list case after case of failure to document or communicate crucial details that cost me days, weeks and even months of effort. But I won't, until I have another job lined up. If I were in the author's position (I'm in another field), I would insist that my colleagues--all of them, in whatever field I ended up working, were forthcoming about their work. This is non-negotiable. Being over-busy is no excuse. (It may be an excuse for not being forthcoming, but right or wrong, I couldn't care less--I would not work with such people if I could avoid it, for whatever reason.)<p>Academia rewards journal publication and does not adequately reward programming and data collection and analysis, although these are indispensable activities that can be as difficult and profound as crafting a research paper. At least the National Science Foundation has done researchers a small favor by changing the NSF biosketch format in mid-January to better accommodate the contributions of programmers and ""data scientists"": the old category <i>Publications</i> has been replaced with <i>Products</i>.<p>Naming is important to administrators and bureaucrats. It can be easy to underestimate the extent to which names matter to them. Now there is a category under which the contribution of a programmer can be recognized for the purpose of academic advancement. Previously one had to force-fit programming under <i>Synergistic Activities</i> or otherwise stretch or violate the NSF biosketch format. This is a small step, but it does show some understanding that the increasingly necessary contributions of scientific programmers ought to be recognized. The alternative is attrition. Like the author of the article, programmers will go where their accomplishments are recognized.<p>Still, reforming old attitudes is like retraining Pavlov's dogs. Scientific programmers are lumped in with ""IT guys."" IT as in ITIL: the platitudinous, highly non-mathematical service as a service as a service Information Technocracy Indoctrination Library. There is little comprehension that computer science has specialized. For many academics, scientific programmers are interchangeable IT guys who do help desk work, system and network administration, build websites, run GIS analyses, write scientific software and get Gmail and Google Calendar synchronization running on Blackberries. It is as if scientists themselves could be satisfied if their colleagues were hired as ""scientists"" or ""natural philosophers"" with no further qualification, as opposed to  ""vulcanologist"" or ""meteorologist"" (to a first order of approximation).",1359273422

5123589,comment,5118782,5120151,2,0,agaricus,,,"Although Mojang did hire the core Bukkit team, the mod API they are working on is planned to be a new API designed from the ground up, rather than Bukkit [1]. Bukkit was designed within constraints appropriate at the time for the environment it arose in (for example, it is layered as: the Bukkit API itself, on top of the CraftBukkit server implementation, which is itself a mod on the ""vanilla"" Minecraft server jar from Mojang -- abstractions to help insulate Bukkit plugins from the volatile nature of Minecraft internals). They did design a fairly good API, the most successful in the Minecraft modding community no doubt, but having a new official API built into the game has a number of advantages and is their ultimate goal. Although there may be a Bukkit compatibility layer or a documentation on porting from Bukkit to the official mod API.<p>It isn't clear what will happen to Bukkit after the official API is released. The founder of Bukkit has said they intend to phase it out. But Bukkit is an open source project, LGPL, with many active contributors and a thriving community of plugin developers. Will be interesting to see what happens, although IMHO a proper, well-designed official Minecraft API can only be for the better.<p>[1] Source: Minecon 2012 API panel",1359273227

5123585,comment,5122978,5122978,3,0,markburns,,,"There's two massively under-addressed problems with the HATEOAS constraint:<p>1. Code-on-demand requires coupling of technology stack of client and server. (If you're going to assume your clients can run javascript or x-technology, where is the decoupling?)<p>2. Out-of-band communcation. Some of the recommendations I've heard have been along the lines of: let's avoid out-of-band communication in API docs etc and have it completely discoverable based on the media type. ""And what happens if the media-type isn't sufficient to represent your use case?""<p>""That's easy, you create your own media type""<p>So in order to have no need for API docs for an actual API, I create a completely separate media type (which will need its own RFC type specification, or at the very least its own API docs).<p>This is purely academic, and I still think that nobody is doing it because only those that have tried it or seriously thought through the implications are naysayers. Nobody who's actually built a system like this is coming forth and explaining the benefits.<p>Maybe if we get some media type that everyone starts using because (unlike XML/JSON etc) it supports full REST-like semantics i.e. forms for POSTing and not just hyperlinks for GET requests, then we may see the purported benefits.
But you still run into the problem of expressing field level validation messages in a 422 response. And expressing the valid values in a reasonable way in a template for an object.<p>Yes, expressing a String or a DateTime object or any other relatively primitive data type with simple validations: presence of, within array of, valid email, valid phone number may be possible.<p>But most of the time you can't predetermine this kind of contract up front. So there's no way of me, the producer of the API, expressing to you, the consumer of the API, that this particular regex completely satisfies my business requirements in all circumstances.<p>If I could nail down the expression of the required values for an API call in any sufficiently complex business system and convey it to you in some easy to digest, computer-understandable format then I'm sure we'd be gold.<p>But reality sets in and you realise you've added a whole bunch of cruft to every API call, and a whole bunch of unnecessary API calls to express some theoretical idea by an academic who admits that he's too busy to actually go away and start building some of these systems.<p>Not only that, you're making it harder for your consumers to integrate. (Unless they are using an already known media-type, which is a chicken and egg situation as the closest we have to being good enough is HTML, and you try explaining to API consumers, yes the future is HTML, and yes I want you to parse HTML to get the data from my API).<p>We could start saying, well hell to efficiency as technology consistently improves, but we're dealing with routing packets over the internet at approximately the speed of light. There is a real-world upper limit to this stuff and we need to improve efficiency because if you add 10 extra HTTP requests per API call, your users _will_ notice. This stuff matters.<p>Hell, even if these are not user critical applications and there is some as yet not understood benefit to the world as a whole having asynchronous processes running in the backends of our systems optimising some problem space and searching for solutions on their own, then we still have another real world problem. There has to be some short to medium to even long-term benefit to building this kind of system to someone.<p>Nobody wants to build this theoretical hypermedia, semantic web on their own dollar when there is no visible pay-off in the near future or even idealistic theoretical pay-off in the long term.",1359273143

We're treated as the number crunchers. The real problem isn't that we waste computational resources, it's that many biologists download programs, run their data through it, and if it spits out an answer rather than an error, they trust it. Since that program probably has zero unit test coverage, and the results may be fed into pharmaceutical decisions, disease diagnostics, etc, you're basically fucked if something went wrong. Lots of us have said this[0].<p>Minor quibble: genome assembly is definitely still an open problem that's computationally difficult.

But even better, MCP includes a comprehensive set of ""mappings"", providing informative names for each class, and most important field and method names.<p>Running a decompiler (JD-GUI or otherwise) on Minecraft by itself will produce obfuscated source, so having this deobfuscation step is very useful as a modder. If a symbol is not deobfuscated, you can submit a proposed name on IRC to MCPBot, or even provide a description for the Javadoc.<p>The end result of running MCP on Minecraft is a fairly readable source base, which one can easily make changes to and recompile. This is how modding frameworks such as FML and Minecraft Forge are built (although CraftBukkit uses a different approach - they don't use MCP but their own, less comprehensive and incompatible mappings, one reason why Forge mods and Bukkit plugins cannot easily be used together, a problem being solved with the merged Forge/Bukkit ""MCPC+"" server from MC Port Central).",1359271850

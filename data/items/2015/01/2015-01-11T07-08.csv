8869395,comment,8868304,8869140,0,0,tjradcliffe,,,"You have no idea.<p>One of my favourite 70&#x27;s quotes is from the quite brilliant book &quot;The Medieval Machine&quot; by the Anglo-French historian Jean Gimpel, published in 1976 (which really is a very good history of Medieval technology):<p>&quot;The economic depression that struck Europe in the fourteenth century was followed ultimately by economic and technological recovery. But the depression we have moved into will have no end. We can anticipate centuries of decline and exhaustion. There will be no further industrial revolution in the cycles of our Western civilization.&quot;<p>These words were written <i>at the same time</i> as Jobs, Wozniak, Gates and Allen were all hard at work. This smug bastard was just one voice amongst many telling the world that we were in the grip of a permanent, inexorable &quot;malaise&quot; that could at best be accepted passively, which there was no point in fighting, which had to be simply taken as given, unstoppable, forever.<p>At the same time people like me were being told by teachers that we would never be able to image the disk of extra-solar stars or discover extra-solar planets, and so on [1]. Gleeful murderers of hope were desperately trying to crush any spark of innovation, creativity or freedom. And it was happening the world over. A relentless, ruthless, assault on the Enlightenment, the rule of law, and the industrial revolution.<p>They failed.<p>A lot of it was funded, ultimately, by the Soviets, who generated an enormous amount of propaganda that was intended to make people believe these things. One of the notable things that happened after the collapse of the Soviet Empire was the stunning pall of silence that fell over the Left in the West. It was almost as if the lifeblood of the whole enterprise had been cut off.<p>Part of that was simple empiricism: it was hard for Leftists to hold up their pathologically insane ideas as &quot;better&quot; when their poster-child had just endured a complete and spectacular collapse, including the freeing of a large number of vassal states, all because some shipyard workers in Poland had laid down tools a decade before.<p>But part of it was also that funding for a bunch of stuff that Comintern paid for (mostly by indirect means, in the same way the US government funds stuff through NGOs today) vanished.<p>Today, hyper-capitalist brands like Naomi Klein are attempting to resurrect some of the old zombie Soviet ideas, but it&#x27;s a pretty pathetic effort, full of contradictions and gibberish. They won&#x27;t have a lot of influence, at the end of the day, and it is my firm belief that we are entering into a century of progress that will make the 19th century look staid and the 20th century look stupid. Having lived through the &#x27;70&#x27;s, this is a good thing to see.<p>[1] We have done both, and more: <a href=""http://www.nasa.gov/content/goddard/astronomers-image-lowest-mass-exoplanet-around-a-sun-like-star/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nasa.gov/content/goddard/astronomers-image-lowest...</a>",1420962821

8869387,comment,8868709,8869224,0,0,mc32,,,"I think your essay will end up being an interesting read.  Not to derail things much but perhaps the ethos is not so much from the place but from the parents.  In my experience new parents who care about education, if they can afford it will move into an area with good schools perpetuating this virtue.  Of course there are some parents who have a lot of money and stay in locales with poor schools but then send their kids to private schools.  I know it seems like one in the same thing but its not.  Parent mentality and culture have a huge influence on how education is perceived.  Some kifs I grew up with --middle class I&#x27;d say, saw school as something in the way of their fun.  It was a burden to some extent.  But there were a few who saw it as a necessity down the road to an imagined future of success.  So parent influence and involvement is key.  Some parents think its the school&#x27;s responsibility --no they are there to supplement parental influence but they very well can&#x27;t supplant it.  You see this in kids who despite parents talking down school seek to do well because they see what their parents don&#x27;t see or despite parents jealousy, etc.<p>Regarding the reporter&#x27;s sincerity about caring, it&#x27;s hard to tell, it could be just getting brownie points on a topical issue or they may really care.  However if they actually really cared and wanted to make a difference doing it from TC does not inspire too much credibility. Typically people who really care move closer to the issue (meaning working on the issue constantly.  If I cared about feral cats then I&#x27;d be involved directly with doing something about feral cats -- otherwise it&#x27;s just a nice opinion.",1420962598

Preventing the device on the circuit that you, the user, cares about from completely melting down is just a nice bonus.<p>That&#x27;s why building wiring codes generally spec fuses to cope with the capacity handled by wiring and switches, rather than the loads attached to it.<p>EDIT: In any case you <i>NEVER</i> want the car to silently and automatically try to &quot;re-set&quot; a tripped breaker, surely. You want this kind of fault to present itself noisily and obviously; it&#x27;s a precursor to a potentially dangerous condition.<p>Any automatic re-set will have to factor in some cool-down time for the wiring in between attempts... what is the temperature of an overheating pair of conductors in the wiring loom when the breaker tripped? What rate of heat dissipation is there allowing them to cool down again? A wire which has experienced overheating will have a different (higher) resistance after the short-circuit event. Even if the wire isn&#x27;t permenantly damaged, the temporary increase in temperature will still guarantee a momentarily higher resistance.

Self-resetting would probably be a bad idea (if there&#x27;s a short, you really do want it to stay off), and even having computer control of it would be questionable (although if the control system met DO-178 standards, it&#x27;d probably be fine), but even a simple feedback mechanism would be a huge win.

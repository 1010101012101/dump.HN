  DateFormat df = DateFormat.getDateInstance(DateFormat.LONG);
  String s = df.format(date);

So the date format formats the date. Why is that? Why is date subordinated to date format here? It could just as well be the other way around. There may be some implementation related reason for that but conceptually it makes no sense at all, it's impossible to guess and hard to remember.<p><pre><code>  s = format(date, date_format)

They would have asked better questions about the due diligence and been more attentive to valuing the buyer -- valuation is what VC firms do -- and might have spotted the problems themselves.  In the worst case, where this disaster still strikes, Goldmans would be far more likely to be reasonable about its responsibilities, lest it spoil its reputation with a well-connected VC.<p>But maybe I exaggerate the business and financial knowledge of tech VC types?<p>I don't much like the idea of allowing big VC firms to collect rents based on their reputation.  But you cannot expect fee-based labor to be as careful and paranoid as you must be on this sort of thing.  Only partnership brings that level of attention.  When the stakes get this high, you need a partner capable of taking these responsibilities.  If your financial partner or CFO isn't up to the task -- and Dragon's CFO was not -- then you have to fill that gap in the _partnership_.<p>Another solution would be bringing in a CFO with an equity stake, but this raises the same problem of financial expertise evaluation that sank the founders here.<p>None of which excuses Goldmans.",1342357266

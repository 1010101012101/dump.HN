3097173,comment,3093323,3093323,2,0,polarist,,,"I took something different to many of the comments here.  I found the most important takeaway was hidden in the later part of the slideshow, and referred to the difference in the attitudes and approaches to learning for two.  Clearly the girl understood that in coding, there's usually a correct way to do things, and was always in search of that answer.<p>That correctness has varying levels of importance depending on the industry/application, but for a sufficiently large and complex project, the benefits to writing correct code is extremely valuable.<p>For instance, if it were a team environment and I had to write some functionality using the code supplied by the girl, I could simply assume standard conventions and immediately attempt to use her classes in my code.  If written correctly, that code might work without further effort my on end.<p>If the code were supplied by the guy, I would likely have to go in to the implementation and ensure that the behavior conformed my expectations.  And having to go through and read the code could require a significant time investment.<p>And of course, reading code often takes significantly (10x++) more time than writing it, so minimizing the necessity for it is essential in maximizing productivity.  I would suspect that in most programming teams that reading other people's code is what eats up the most time, yet this time can be significantly reduced by following such a standard.<p>When the slideshow begins to refer to C++ conventions and the ""rule of three,"" the guy shows that he doesn't take into account that others may need to work with his code.  This can be dangerous as this single new team member can actually cause the total productivity of the team to <i>decrease</i>.<p>While this guy is just a made-up character, I wouldn't be surprised if most programmers think/act like him.  At the very least, the majority of the ones that I've worked with, do.<p>On another note, the minutia details of C do come up if you work with and read enough source code.  Being able to understand it is the more important issue at hand.  Also, in response to many comments stating that writing code that works based on such minutia is poor practice, I think the girl would likely agree.",1318309048
3097172,comment,3093450,3097144,3,0,erichocean,,,"For those wondering why Netflix was allowed to stream content at low cost so far, here's the reason: marginal consumers.<p>Currently, the content industry gets $32 billion/year for content. There are still a few people (""marginal consumers"") that aren't paying for content now, but at a much subsidized price, are willing to view it.<p>These are the customers Netflix has right now for streaming.<p>Now here's the problem: marginal consumers are only marginal when the represent an insignificant portion of users. When they grow numerous enough, the pricing terms have to change. That's why Netflix is jacking up prices.<p>Eventually, Netflix will have to pay the same price as Cable providers for content (and it's nowhere as close to as cheap as what Netflix is charging now).",1318309024

3097164,comment,3096793,3097030,176,0,mdasen,,,"Answering as someone Jewish. . .<p>Jews don't assimilate (fully).  In the Passover story, one of the things we note is that even living in Egypt for a long time, they didn't assimilate and they were disliked for it.  Heck, how often do you hear people talking about other immigrants ""not assimilating these days"".  For centuries, Jews even spoke a language other than the vernacular.  We're a much more tolerant world today and yet there are plenty in this country (the US) that wish everyone ""would just speak English"".  I have plenty of friends whose parents grew up speaking Yiddish in this country.<p>Likewise, Jews were seen as people with divided loyalties.  But this, again, isn't specific to Jews.  Kennedy took plenty of hits as people questioned if he'd ""just do what the pope told him to do.""  Were Jews really going to be loyal to the state they lived in?  In an era when wars were often fought with what makes today's reasons seem air-tight, would Jews decide to sit on the sidelines (since they weren't really X nationality)?  I mean, imagine if the US and Canada got into a war over who could call they're syrup ""maple syrup"".  Would you fight in that?  People have fought for some stupid things.  Also, during a decent period of time, mercantilism became a big factor in economic thinking.  If Jews didn't see a problem with cross-border trade, that was doing economic harm.<p>For Christians, ""you've heard the good news and yet you still reject Christ?!?""  This is one of the more simplistic ones.  People have killed (and continue to do so) for religious reasons.  Jews were especially problematic for Christianity.  Here you have the predecessor religion co-existing.  If they thrive more than the Christians, does G-d like them better than the Christians?  And there's plenty of ""they killed Christ"" to go around.<p>Jews are, in some ways, refugees.  I mean, there was an ancient state that existed and then diaspora as the Jews had to leave their homeland.  First, people often don't like immigrants.  How much scapegoating happens even today around immigrants and crime, jobs, culture, etc.?  Heck, even things like sexuality come into play.  In a lot of anti-Semitic literature, Jews were portrayed as ultra-sexual in the same ""hide your daughters"" way that can happen with African Americans today.  Second, people really don't like refugees.  I mean, these are people coming with nothing.  These aren't university trained computer programmers coming over like H1-B visa getters.  These are people who have it really hard.<p>Beyond that, someone like Dawkins might point out that we try to propel our genes and like genes forward.  A decent amount of history looks like people trying to force their culture, their nationality, and their genes forward through history.  Jews were a different group.  If you're under the impression that wealth cannot be created, then any wealth that Jews get is wealth that people like you don't have.  So, it becomes competitive in that sense and people try to propel people like them forward through history.<p>I guess I'll also touch on the fact that diaspora Judaism somewhat flies in the face of nationalism.  I mean, if you're big into patriotism and nationalism, then the state should be the citizen's first priority, right?  I think a lot of us now see the state as a tool meant to make our lives more stable and just.  We don't live for the glory of our country.  Our country is meant to help us have better lives.  When we serve our country, it's to enhance the lives of the people and increase justice, not to enhance the country (although they sometimes go hand in hand).  This is a big shift in modern thought (at least to me).  But diaspora Judaism can fly in the face of ""commitment to your country should take precedence over commitment to something else"".  I mean, to us it might sound ridiculous to say that your country should matter more than your morality - and I mean secular morality here.  But in a Europe coming out of feudalism where they were trying to define national loyalties and borders, worried about losing territory to the neighboring country, worried about all sorts of things that look foolish from a modern perspective, well, if Jews weren't going to care if they were Polish or Russian, that was a huge problem.  Frankly, this is one of the reasons that Jews came to America.  While America has its nationalism, it's pluralistic, and it's often based off good governance and democratic principles more than the history of most places.<p>Jews could also be insular.  Kosher dietary laws meant that they didn't eat with non-Jews and that they bought their food from within the community.  Again, it's easy to see how something like ""those assholes won't buy meat from me saying my meat isn't clean!"" turns into anti-semitism in the way rumors spread.  Before cars, towns were organized for churches or shuls to be within walking distance which means segregation.<p>Heck, even looking at the Harvard example, you see a private club that had a certain culture that was losing that culture.  No longer would Harvard be almost all Wasp.  I mean, they and their forefathers had put their money and effort into it.  Shouldn't their progeny and the progeny of their religion and culture get the benefits of it?  I'm not saying you should agree with that logic, but it is logic that is often used.  I mean, there are people who don't want this country to become Spanish speaking or bi-lingual.  Whether someone is the first person someplace or not, people and culture become entrenched and people don't want to see that culture change away from them.  Heck, how much complaining do some people do that a lot of advertisements don't say ""Merry Christmas""?  Harvard was created by Wasps and now it was benefitting Jews and turning more Jewish.  The identity of the institution was changing.<p>It isn't that the hatred is that different from a lot of other ethnic hatred.  A lot of it can be seen in a lot of the other ethno-religious hatred that has existed in the world.  It's that the Jews hit a lot of different sore points in human history.  There was religion, there was national identity, there was immigrant status, there was language, there was hope of another homeland, their was separateness/insular-ness, etc.<p>I come from the point of view that nationalism is a bit outdated.  People deserve to be justly governed in ways that make their lives better and that they should be allowed to choose how to live their lives in a way that makes them happy (clearly with restrictions on things that cannot be abided like murder).  But providing good, just governance isn't why Europe has so many countries.  Good governance and happy lives for citizens isn't why England subjugated Wales.  Justice isn't what drove the Reconquista of Spain.  Power, control, and the perpetuation of one's genes, culture, language, and religion have been a driving force in human history.<p>I, for one, am happy that we at least see such injustice and hatred as a bad thing these days.  I'm not sure if you were looking for an answer like this.  I didn't mean for it to be long like this.  Hatred can be a bit hard to wrap one's head around (at least for me) and yet it's defined a lot of human history.  I can't imagine someone hating me without knowing me.  I don't understand it.  I'm nice (honest)!  Yet, even without understanding it, I know there are people who wish I didn't exist who don't even know me.  It's actually quite an odd feeling.",1318308804

Monetary policy is the process by which the monetary authority of a country controls the supply of money, often targeting a rate of interest for the purpose of promoting economic growth and stability.
In economics, fiscal policy is the use of government expenditure and revenue collection (taxation) to influence the economy.<p>So we lower interest rates and print money. Then we tell banks to loan and we use revenue (or printed money) to invest in ""infrastructure"" or to just drop money from helicopters. So what happens when debt gets so high from spending that you'll never repay it in several generations? What happens when all this doesn't work? What happens when the savers get wiped out? Did they write that part in the economics textbooks?<p>I guess we just reset? And start all over at 1913? I'm seriously asking. What? I wonder if the #OWS gang understands that by reseting they wipe out their parents and their grandparents... are they ready for that?<p>I'm far from right wing, I believe tax is essential to prosperity, I also believe in infrastructure spending, and social security to a point. I do however believe that government (both right and left) is eternally corupt. I also believe the taxes will never be high enough to give everyone everything they want. It's like talking to my 16 year old niece. She wants to live at home, play on her IPad, party till 2 in the morning, drink herself stupid, and has no idea where her dad is coming from when he says it will end one day if she doesn't wise up. It will end well, or very very poorly. She just riots in the street and talks about all the things that are owed to her for existing.<p>I guess this is just frustrating because this really was simple. We should have forced people (banks) to bare the burden of their decisions (loans!). We force investment banks and investors to do the same. The market really does regulate itself...but when politicians tinker...bad things happen. Nationalizing the banks? Why the hell would any right minded fed chairman do that? Like I say, great in theory, horrible in practice. Krugman is pure theory.<p>The bottom line is that Kenyesanism has been a disaster due to it's constant corruption from political parties and the revoloving doors. Krugman always provides the answer, straight from the textbook. In the end, we all end up like Greece. And I'm sure Krugman will be along saying, well the text book says....",1318306464

Of course you can't have the CTO drop everything when there's an unexpected bug, but I do think there is value in coding, even for ""upper"" management. Even looking in on the code from time to time can give you a snapshot of where the product is at and in which direction it is evolving. If that direction is different from what you expected, you can ask the programmers why they chose to use the approach they did.<p>I think the most important thing is that the CTO does not place his or her code above the code of the individual maintenance programmer. The worst thing he or she can do is somehow mark his or her code as ""untouchable"". Untouchable code is bad code, regardless of how well it works or how well it's written. It doesn't adapt to changing requirements like the rest of the application, and the rest of the application has to go out of its way to accommodate it.<p>However, as long as he or she makes it perfectly clear that his or her code is just as subject to change and modification as everyone else's, I don't see why the CEO/CTO can't get their hands dirty now and again.",1318305858

I've stopped posting anything with a link there because it's subliminally annoying seeing my posts get mangled when the original url was informative and there are all the same privacy issues.  Twitter has managed to raise the annoyance and friction of using it for anything to do with urls enough to kill that off for me and I can't help but wonder how many other people.  I know the link text is displayed on the site, but New Twitter is just as annoying as it ever has.  Congratulations Twitter - you've started killing off the open clients, you've tried to snoop on every link clicked by a Twitter user, and you've quite thoroughly demonstrated that you've got the determination to keep making things worse.  Bye!",1318305729

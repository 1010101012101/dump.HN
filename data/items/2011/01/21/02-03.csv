2126244,comment,2122394,2122589,0,0,shaver,,,"[Disclosure: I work at Mozilla, and have been closely involved in the JS engine for some time.]<p>For a while (3.5 and 3.6, I think), Linux distributors shipped 64-bit builds of Firefox, which did not have JIT support.  (Mozilla did not produce supported Linux-64 builds until 4.0.) Experimental Windows 64-bit builds had the same problem, but most people even on 64-bit Windows would use the 32-bit version.  Linux distributors would also build Firefox to ease their package management, rather than to optimize startup speed, so again if using a distro Linux build you were in the penalty box.<p>MSVC also has PGO support which we still can't get working properly on gcc, and which used to make a very substantial difference in JS performance, and still makes a small one.  Add to that the PIC register overhead, and that we had to compile with frame pointer on Linux for some time until we added CFI support to the crash reporting software, and there were lots of places where the toolchain just didn't keep up.<p>Animated performance tests are likely to be slower on Linux than on Windows due to graphics differences rather than the underlying JS performance.  In fact, one of the ways that we generally tell if something is JS-related or not in initial triage is whether it's cross-platform or different on different OSes.<p>Windows is where most of our users are, but most of our developers are still on OS X I think.  After that is probably Linux, but it's a close call.  More are moving to Windows, mostly to be closer to the dominant user experience.  Linux generally suffers most in the graphical department, due to the...variable quality of available drivers.  compiz itself has an extensive blacklist of drivers, and that's coming from the distros themselves!  I don't think anyone can reliably get Linux video driver bugs fixed, and we've been waging a battle against Linux graphics stack performance problems for some time ourselves.<p>(One major performance issue for us is theme drawing and using stock icons and doing other ""be a good Linux desktop citizen"" stuff.  Chrome went the other way, doing their own thing and not having to load icons synchronously, or re-initialize the font system on startup, or do all form-widget drawing through gdk-indirection-slowtown.  I think it's clear at this point that we erred in listening to what the Linux faithful told us they wanted, and we should have listened to our instincts.)<p>On Android our JS performance is pretty great, even though the native toolchain isn't exactly fantastic.  That's probably the most important Linux platform in the world right now.",1295578314

Many smart people, including many people on HN, think that AdWords is an auction.  AdWords is <i>not</i> an auction.  AdWords has a price discovery strategy which is partially auction-like, but the actual ad displayed will be a) from whomever Google darn pleases at b) whatever price Google darn pleases.  (In addition to being best at the world at processing large amounts of information, Google isn't too shabby at PR, so they call this Quality Score and tell people that the revenue maximization strategy for the world's largest advertising firm is in people's best interest... <i>and people believe them</i>.)<p>In addition to displaying explicit preferences for particular businesses and for/against particular business models, Google uses large amounts of proprietary black magic to determine minimum pricing.  For example, keywords in a field known to be awash in money with <i>no competition</i> will not be priced at the systemwide minimum price, but will rather be priced much higher.  The exact level is, again, wherever Google darn well pleases.  They have teams of very smart people working on revenue maximization.<p>I love AdWords.  It's the best idea any corporation has come up with in the last twenty years, and is largely responsible for me being at my kitchen table right now instead of being miserable in my cubicle.

It allows you to take notes & place follow-up tasks on contacts as well.<p>Finally, you can share your pad with anyone simply by dragging & dropping any one of your contacts to the ""Padmates"" group. They can then login and manage the account with you - send emails under their own name - add & edit notes/tasks under your contacts etc..

Probably even FB. Then, they also have their ad network and services (gmail, search, maps, etc) to sign up users and promote offers. This is 2 good solutions for problem #1 for a local business deals network.<p>Google is making a smart move. Most of the bigger deal sites share an uncanny similarity - they are called ""clones"" for a reason. And the way to stand out is to offer better deals. I have gotten the Groupon newsletter since they came to NYC, and I have never bought a deal. And I am usually a very compulsive shopper. There is not enough variety and nothing is that compelling. The way to stand out is to target deals better so you can make money on margins instead of volume and offer more lucrative deals for businesses. FB may have as much data, but Google has shipped better big-data targeting than anybody else. You need to acquire, sort, and analyze the data, and then have the relationships to exploit your insights. And as location, purchase history, and timing come into play, the data is going to get big if you want to target deals well.",1295577062

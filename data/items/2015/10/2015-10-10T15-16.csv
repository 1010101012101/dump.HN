The USGS prices are for wholesale markets, not retail mercury.<p>A <i>retail consumer</i> investor, who is storing it in their home, is paying <i>retail consumer</i> prices. They aren&#x27;t showing up at the cinnabar mines and tapping a spigot for bulk prices. My diamond analogy is exactly correct. That&#x27;s why it&#x27;s a scam: because you are paying inflated prices for something you cannot possibly sell at anything remotely like what you paid for it, and in the case of mercury, it&#x27;s worse than if you bought some diamonds because at least diamonds aren&#x27;t ticking timebombs.",1444492755

The same applies, when activating a shortcut: for example, starting with my hands on the home row, I can do 10 activations of copy (Cmd+C), returning my hands to the home row between each activation, in about 8 seconds. Using the mouse in a similar manner to select the corresponding menu item takes about 22 seconds. Just moving my hand from the home row to the mouse and back again ten times takes around 9 seconds.<p>(These times are all slightly approximate, because I&#x27;m going by eye, because with 2 hands on the home row I don&#x27;t have a hand left to operate the stopwatch.)<p>The longer the shortcut, the more time it takes to activate, of course; here, I picked a nice easy one, in the form of Cmd+C. Maybe that&#x27;s cheating. Some of the fiddlier emacs shortcuts can be quite time-consuming to enter - the rect ones are particularly bad - C-x r C-w, that sort of thing. I wonder how much quicker those are? But I&#x27;d imagine they&#x27;ll still win out over moving from keyboard to mouse to menu bar and back, since for shortcuts you invoke often, muscle memory takes over and you can rattle them off without even thinking.<p>Maybe all those piano lessons helped after all.<p>The reader is invited to use their preconceived opinions about microoptimization to decide which conclusion to draw.<p>(I have no particular opinion about what to do if your hand is on the mouse to start with. Generally I move it back to the keyboard if I don&#x27;t know how to do something with the mouse, or leave it there if I do. For things such as moving the cursor, or scrolling, the mouse is very effective anyway; usually effective enough that in many cases it&#x27;s worth using in preference to the keyboard, if you don&#x27;t have some non-interactive higher-level motion that you could conceivable invoke, such as M-x forward-sexp, or whatever.)",1444492690

Sure, you can create a synthetic problem and dataset where you need to order four different categories, all comprising around quarter of the whole, and there a bar chart would excel.<p>But that&#x27;s not actually that common a use case: a lot of the time, I&#x27;d only be interested that they are all roughly a quarter of the whole, and not care beyond that (providing a ranking of small differences can actually be pretty misleading, depending on the problem you&#x27;re trying to answer).<p>I can just as easily say, I want to know roughly what proportion of the whole a category comprises. And with widely varying category sizes, the pie chart excels, while with a bar chart I&#x27;d have to sum the bar sizes in my head, and divide that total by the category in question. That&#x27;s at least as taxing as having to differentiate between small differences in pie slice sizes.<p>The answer isn&#x27;t &quot;always use pie charts&quot; or &quot;never use pie charts&quot;: it&#x27;s to use what&#x27;s best for a particular situation and context.",1444492353

And this is out of thousands of people.<p>I think part of the reason is that it&#x27;s actually a lot easier to determine if someone is predisposed to mental illness than it actually is to determine if the person sitting in front of you has a mental illness. E.g. if one of your parents was bipolar or you had a relative who committed suicide then you&#x27;d be immediately excluded from any trial.

The piston thing is however totally idiomatic and recommended by the piston devs, while I&#x27;ve never seen anyone actually loop over an Option in real code.<p>Though it wouldn&#x27;t be super terrible if it was idiomatic. I personally prefer to do `s.map(|val| { ... }), but there&#x27;s a contingent that argues that `map` shouldn&#x27;t be used purely for side-effects, and should instead be used for, you know, mapping. We&#x27;ve oft argued that if you want to consume an iterator, it aught to be with a `for` loop, so it might make sense to say the same about an Option? Option is such a trivial and core type that you basically end up with 4 ways to do everything you could think of, because semantically distinct conventions all end up doing the exact same thing:<p><pre><code>    for x in data { 
        println!(&quot;{}&quot;, x) 
    }
    
    if let Some(x) = data { 
        println!(&quot;{}&quot;, x) 
    }
    
    data.map(|x| {
        println!(&quot;{}&quot;, x)
    });
    
    match data { 
        Some(x) => println!(&quot;{}&quot;, x), 
        _ => () 
    }

</code></pre>
The fact that you can loop over an option is kind of a side-effect of a lot of our APIs taking &quot;thing that is iterable&quot;, and evidently it was convenient to provide that for Option (which is after all just a really degenerate collection).<p>You can of course `match` and `if let` an Option because it&#x27;s an enum, but because there&#x27;s two cases and one has no state, they end up being completely equivalent (the `_ =>` branch is just an `else`).<p>Then finally you can `map` over an Option because... It&#x27;s Option. That&#x27;s what you do with optional types, dangit!",1444490606

Device drivers, system calls, synchronization support etc. are part of the kernel. Native netmap support for a NIC only involves 3-400 lines of code, or 10% of the typical device driver.<p>Processes do ioctl(), mmap() and poll() for I/O - all standard system calls implemented by the OS, there is no NIC-specific code in the application. NICs can be switched in and out of netmap mode without reloading modules (and with the cloudflare patch, even sharing the two modes). There are no custom memory pools or hugepages to reserve. Device configuration relies on ethtool and ifconfig etc.<p>This approach is what let the cloudflare folks implement their traffic steering with zero new code, just a couple of ethtool lines; the change they contributed back to support the split mode is completely agnostic of the specific NIC being used.",1444490050

I speak English and German natively, and I can&#x27;t stand it when people criticize the other language on such personal grounds.<p>As for your take on the redundancy of natural languages, I would point out that it is perfectly natural and can probably be found in just about any language. (Otherwise, there would be no such thing as a thesaurus...) To stick with your example, you could also talk about &quot;the boarding pass&quot; instead of &quot;the ticket&quot; in English.<p>Indeed, the redundancy of words and vocabulary forms much of the beauty of a language. Especially in English much of poetry is the art of choosing the right word. I love the way T.S. Eliot puts it towards the end of his poem &quot;Little Gidding&quot;:<p><pre><code>  And every phrase
  And sentence that is right (where every word is at home,
  Taking its place to support the others,
  The word neither diffident nor ostentatious,
  An easy commerce of the old and the new,
  The common word exact without vulgarity,
  The formal word precise but not pedantic,
  The complete consort dancing together)
</code></pre>
So please, if you want to criticize a language at all, let&#x27;s stick to the objective side as far as possible. German grammar is difficult, English pronunciation can be utterly confusing - I&#x27;ll grant that. But let&#x27;s not talk about any &quot;bad natural languages&quot;.

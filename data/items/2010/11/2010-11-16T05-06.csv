Give me personalized recommendations on restaurants so I can stop trying to comb through mountains of sometimes non-sensical, irrelevant Yelp reviews to decide what new restaurant to try.<p>A lot of comments here have complained that this has been tried and done. My question is, where? Does Yelp already do something like this? I went on Yelp a few days ago looking for this exact service. I'm not a Yelp user, and I just wanted something quick and lightweight that would give me recommendations based on my preferences. Found nothing to that effect. In order to contribute at all, I have to write a full review for a bunch of restaurants.",1289887085

But that's because Google has not complied with mainland laws or Chinese business culture. Google's poor performance is still Google's fault at core. Had they brought their tech into China and then taken their American hands off and let mainland Chinese (or Taiwanese, who are also adept at the mainland market) businessmen manage their branch as they saw fit, they would've done fine. The government wouldn't have disrupted them if they had focused on maintaining good government relations.<p>A big part of the reason KFC crushes McDonalds here (it has 4x the number of stores if I recall correctly) is that KFC China was put into the hands of Taiwanese who created localized products and degraded quality and sanitation for the sake of price and fast growth. The American McDonald's managers wanted Chinese McDs to be just like the ones all over the rest of the world - including the same hygiene standards.

1909154,comment,1907890,1907890,0,0,coffeemug,,,"I cannot believe people bring up Israeli airport security as an example of a system the U.S. should model. The security agents are neither intelligent, nor well trained, nor polite. The entire system is based on racism and I would take TSA security over the Israeli model any day. People were complaining here about a pat down search in public by a TSA agent equaling sexual harassment. I was actually taken to a public bathroom by an El Al agent and strip searched, purely because my last name ""sounds Turkish"".<p>From my anecdotal experience, El Al has security personnel that appears trained to a naked eye, but in reality is extremely ineffective, flawed, and unethical. I had the misfortune to go through El Al security four times. These all occurred in a span of two weeks, roughly in the same circumstances (I had to fly into Israel, fly out, fly back in, and fly back out). I can tell you that the outcome of their screening is heavily inconsistent and highly dependent on the prejudices of the particular agent doing the interview, and not necessarily on advanced training procedures.<p>I had the same answers for their questions every time. Two of the times the agents were Israeli jews who immigrated from Russia. Since we share a common background, both let me pass after very few questions because my trip details seemed perfectly reasonable to them. The other two times, I was interviewed by jews of clearly middle-eastern descent - both had no understanding of my cultural background, and both thought my trip details were extremely suspicious, subjecting me to a detailed search. So the outcome of the interviews was effectively random, which means they might as well perform random searches.<p>The interviews were highly unethical, inappropriate, and degrading. Even more importantly, they were completely ineffective, resulting in a random outcome highly dependent on each agent's personal prejudices. I don't know what good security looks like, but I can tell you that this most certainly isn't it.",1289884845

1909131,comment,1907271,1908470,0,0,jerf,,,"You said ""instantaneously"". That usually would imply traveling outside of your lightcone. That really is undefined; an ""instantaneous"" transport from here can end up anywhere outside of your lightcone, which are all equally well(/poorly) defined in relativity. You can't distinguish those points in either time or space without creating a preferred reference frame.<p>This is the same reason FTL drives are also, fundamentally, time machines. It's really a very profound thing; there's no ""yeah, but really we know there's an absolute time frame underneath it all""... there really, <i>really</i> isn't an absolute time frame, and you really, <i>really</i> can't say how old the black hole would be if you ""instantaneously"" transported there; it is just as valid to instantaneously appear when it is 31 years old as it would be to appear when it is 100,000,029 years old (taking of course the estimated age as its true age). Or, IMHO, just as invalid because FTL and instantaneous truly don't exist.<p>Yes, if you change your claim to be sublight and non-instantaneous we can compute how old it would be, but that's a profound goal post shift.<p>The Minkowski metric is a mindbender, the moreso once you realize that it is not some weird mathematical abstraction with no connection to reality, it <i>is</i> reality, or at least a much better approximation than the one we instinctively use. The ""weird mathematical abstraction with no connection to reality"" is the implicitly Euclidean/Galilean metric that exists in our heads.

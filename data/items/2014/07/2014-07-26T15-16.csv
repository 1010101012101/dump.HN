There&#x27;s about a billion http servers out there, and some of them are even good. Most popular http servers let you compile custom modules that run in the same process, which would have the same effect as Nope.c but without all the flaws.<p>If you need a C http implementation with a tiny footprint, grab a tiny http server that has been around for a long time (there are many) and hack on it. Busybox httpd, thttpd, boa, etc all come to mind, and there&#x27;s probably dozens more. But even those support CGI, and it&#x27;ll be much more scalable to not have to re-compile and re-ship and re-start your entire http process every time you need to edit a page.<p>Write your CGI/FastCGI/whatever app in C, compile it, and let the http server run it. It&#x27;s much better suited to deal with securing the connection and handling the fucked-up edge cases of different browsers, platforms, proxies, RFCs, tcp/ip stacks, etc etc etc. As a hack, if your environment has a shell, write your CGI web apps in shell script; it compresses great, can be edited on the fly, and uses existing system resources.<p>I have written http server implementations. I have written boatloads of server-side applications. I&#x27;ve even written an entire CGI web interface and framework in C. It&#x27;s fucking abysmal.

Politeness is good, but it doesn&#x27;t necessarily improve the world- just keeps it from getting worse.<p>Innovation and teaching go well beyond inoffensiveness— they directly help improve the lives of others.

There&#x27;s a history of locally owned utilities working well. Besides electricity, locally owned telephone companies are also popular around the region.<p>Another big thing is that the interests of the business community and the residents are aligned in rural areas. There was no carrier hotel or POPs by any other providers in Dalton. Before muni fiber in both Dalton and Chattanooga if you wanted high speed internet you&#x27;d have to get a private loop backhaul all the way to Atlanta and then also pay for the internet access. No national or local providers had IP routers with gig-e or above ports locally that I&#x27;m aware of. Not like in Atlanta where you can get a local loop (from multiple national providers) to a carrier hotel and have your pick of 50+ IP transit providers.<p>Muni fiber was the only option for affordable internet access for both businesses and residents in these areas, and the utility was guaranteed an almost instant monopoly on high speed internet for business users. They electric cos also had all the rights of way and customer billing infrastructure, pre-built client base, and were running fiber anyway for their own use in managing the power network.<p>I think there&#x27;s a reason why almost every successful muni fiber ISP is in a rural area with a muni electric company, and that&#x27;s that local governments probably shouldn&#x27;t be in the ISP game, but in some cases it&#x27;s the only option by communities to obtain high speed internet, and in those cases necessity is the mother of invention.<p>In larger cities, I think the model would have to be different, and a muni fiber network would be a transport loop only service and you&#x27;d get to pick which ISP to connect to on the other end, like DSL in the CLEC days.",1406387248

This is really what vim is about to me - providing a language to describe text transformations, in the form of sequences of commands.  This means that the way I code every day, conveniently saving me a few seconds like you mentioned above, is the same method I use when writing/editing plugins/macros for the editor to do more complicated tasks, like say consistently formatting every line of a log file that begins with [ERROR] and removing all other lines, so we can process it with some other tool.<p>Sure, you could write a script in [python/perl/ruby/etcetcetc] to do all that just as well, but the point is that Vim provides a nice little domain specific language right at your fingertips, optimized for working with text at a higher level, capable of handling one-off jobs as easily as big jobs over a whole log file or even as a little command to be reused later.",1406387214

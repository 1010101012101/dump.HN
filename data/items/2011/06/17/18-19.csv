I should have explained it better.<p>What I meant was: The whole 'in hot code' part of the slides didn't make sense to me, because it's something like a list of (unexplained) statements. I know what 'hot code' refers to, I just don't particularly like to accept things as facts without a minimum of explanation. Probably the author is dead on and I'm sure he knows a lot more about the technology than I do, but 'don't use X, use Y' or 'avoid Z' is something that should be qualified.<p>Probably the talk did that.",1308337138

2666593,comment,2665765,2666521,10,0,daeken,,,"> Lulzsec isn't even calling their shots. They're casting around for security issues widely without rhyme or reason. You're supposed to lock your front door, but if you go through a neighborhood and try everyone's front doors you'll always find one that's left open. Now imagine your neighborhood is the world. It's literally impossible that you'll ever run out of victims.<p>And <i>that</i> is why this stuff is easily avoidable.  Much like a lock on your door isn't going to stop a determined thief from breaking in, simple protections won't stop a determined attacker from breaking into your site.  But in an age where adding CSRF tokens is simple, SQLi protection is nearly guaranteed by using an ORM and/or parameterized queries, XSS is largely mitigated by filtering on templates, etc, it's <i>not that hard</i> to remove the low-hanging fruit from your site.  Even with these, you will still have vulnerabilities, but a drive-by attack like those executed by Lulzsec will <i>not</i> work.<p>> But taken in aggregate, it's not all their 30,000,000 individual failures, it's a failure of the computer industry that has long pushed speed and ease over safety and continues to sweep the current security environment under the rug.<p>It's easier than ever to write secure code without even trying.  If you follow, say, a basic Django tutorial, you won't be vulnerable to XSS and SQLi unless you color outside the lines.  Add in CSRF middleware, and suddenly CSRF attacks (and a large amount of reflected XSS with them) are mitigated.  These are not difficult things, and the software industry is getting better and better about making secure coding the rule, not the exception.",1308336136

Sure, they have the marketing posters in the shop window and the inkjet printed signs confirming they have stock of iPhone 5S in gold. But walk in the store, and it&#x27;s a completely different story: Android everywhere, and salespeople that seem to universally push alternatives.<p>It&#x27;s understandable. Whenever a new model is released, Apple&#x27;s constrained supply means these store&#x27;s daily profits are dictated by whatever supply Apple decides to give them. They&#x27;re likely getting much smaller margins than other brands, and therefore limited in their ability to lure customers with discounts.<p>--<p>As far as I can tell, Android owners fall into these categories:<p>1. Educated customers that genuinely want an Android-only advantage (e.g. oversized screen)<p>2. Uneducated customers who bought whatever the salesperson recommended.<p>3. People with tight budgets or low expectations that might otherwise have purchased a feature-phone.<p>4. Counter-trend hipsters who think Apple is too mainstream. Seriously. I know quite a few people who fit this category.<p>5. Stupid Google fanboys who are convinced Android is amazing open source nirvana, and probably haven&#x27;t ever owned an iPhone anyway... because they&#x27;re not an stupid Apple fanboy.",1393995430

It&#x27;s really hard for people to accept that someone is 3X or 5X or 100X more valuable than they are--either way, it&#x27;s not a positive thought. I think more important than exposing salary numbers is being transparent about <i>why</i> those numbers are the way they are. Having the company tell me that Bill makes twice as much as me, by itself, might actually make things worse (especially if I don&#x27;t think Bill deserves it), but knowing that he makes twice as much because he is highly specialized in a specific thing that the company really needs is useful because it gives me a hint as to how I can reach that level.",1393995211

You can just search for &quot;tampon virgin&quot; and come up with a ton of sites and people that try to reassure girls that using a tampon doesn&#x27;t mean you lose your virginity.<p>I also grew up in LA and not in the middle of some super conservative area, but my girlfriends used to freak the hell out when they needed to dip into my stash during emergencies and all they found were tampons. Sex ed until I took the high school edition didn&#x27;t help much there either. It was only into high school/college that tampons were way more commonly used. Today I still have a mix of tampons and pads in my bathroom for anyone that needs it.<p>I don&#x27;t have an explicit &quot;tampon virgin&quot; story to share right now, but here&#x27;s one I saved from reddit a while ago that made me gag: <a href=""http://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/utzu0/ladies_your_hymen_is_not_a_barrier_that_is_torn/c4yjudt"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/utzu0/ladie...</a><p>There&#x27;s also some terrible stories in this link shared with me on irc that made me almost have an asthma attack laughing earlier today: <a href=""http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/1zinku/sexed_teachers_of_reddit_what_is_the_craziest/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/1zinku/sexed_teac...</a><p>For the other stuff...idk. I hang out in /r/twoxsex and used to hang out on the VaginaPagina LJ community and read the hell out of Scarleteen among other resources. It&#x27;s a bit self selecting, but there&#x27;s a lot of myths that get busted often. One I can think of - I started hormonal birth control really early because I had very heavy+painful periods with iron deficiency anemia (like, passing out in the middle of the street bad) and my parents and I went through a couple different doctors that were all judgmental about a 13-14 year old on the pill. I eventually just went to Planned Parenthood for gynecology needs (amazing people!) and they were all understanding and hush hush because parents of other women would sometimes illegally pester them for more information. So there&#x27;s the &quot;young teen/woman on birth control must be having sex and not need it for anything else&quot; bullshit right there. Another one: right now I have an IUD, and everyone feels the need to tell me about the one friend of a friend story about a uterine perforation - legitimately a risk, but not like it&#x27;s an inevitability for everyone using the IUD. There&#x27;s also the twist on the tampon virginity that involves the menstrual cup. I also like to talk about skipping periods since I used to do it for a few years, and so. many. people. think it&#x27;s a terrible thing to do. Meanwhile every doctor I had since going to Planned Parenthood thought it was a good thing to do, and this year for the first time in ~14 years since hitting puberty I finally have normal levels of iron without making an effort to supplement it. It&#x27;s pretty wild. So much of it is so everyday if you spend enough time around frustrated women that I almost forget that these are really big problems.",1393992964

I know many get around this surreptitiously using the &quot;enterprise&quot; program (my hunch is Apple knows but quietly lets it slide knowing that a lot of the best developers do this).<p>Compared with rooting an android, jail breaking an iPhone seems more risky and less effective. And Apple seems to have succumbed to carriers wrt banning tethering apps not only from the app store, but also in code (from what I hear, haven&#x27;t had the chance to see if it&#x27;s possible yet).<p><i>However</i>, there are a lot of reasons startups still start with iOS and leave android as a second thought:<p>1. iOS users actually <i>buy</i> apps, use them, and spend money in them which is extremely rare amongst android users<p>2. A <i>lot</i> more iOS users have the latest OS and <i>enough</i> also the latest hardware, which means you can do the coolest stuff the platform allows and (at least initially) not have to worry about deprecating well for legacy devices/OS.<p>3. the devices themselves are (as pg wrote) <i>just too much better designed</i> compared to to even the best android phones. I have a nexus 5 and iPhone 5s and slowly over time I pretty much only use the iPhone except when developing for android.

Cue the &quot;correlation isn&#x27;t causality&quot; soundbite, but coffee consumption is negatively correlated with developing Parkinson&#x27;s disease, and moderate consumption of alcohol has been shown by many studies to correlate with positive cardiovascular status.

(This ignores the extremely significant social ramifications of cryptocurrencies becoming more popular every day as a result of this, but those network effects are a fairly predictable S-curve.)<p>You&#x27;re absolutely right that we&#x27;ve yet to see a preference emerge, but you&#x27;re also modelling it as a choice between two options. In an environment where new currencies are being created daily, I doubt that the existence or lack of a mining cap will be of much relevance. I suspect that new generations of currencies will repeatedly overtake older ones (either as general-use currencies like BTC or specific-value ones like NMC) long before mining of the older currencies is cut off.<p>I don&#x27;t think we&#x27;ll ever settle into a one-coin environment, and I don&#x27;t think that would be healthy. In fact I would hope that the opposite situation occurs â€” a world where currencies take on semantic value due to the way their particular featuresets interact with human nature. Value and wealth should maintain some amount of non-universality. That effectively dissolves the question of capped vs. uncapped mining as ideals.",1393992055

After 2 years I transferred to a top 50 university, and it&#x27;s a miserable system.  I&#x27;m taking grad classes at the same time as undergrad to try to spice up what I&#x27;m learning, but the complete lack of interest-driven education is absolutely despicable.  I would drop out and work as a freelance coder full time (it&#x27;s crazy how much that pays), but I only have a year left, supposedly.  My grades are only good in the classes I&#x27;ve enjoyed and have been interested in, and the rest are Cs and low Bs.  Even an F.  I just can&#x27;t bring myself to mundane, boring work.  I know that people say I should learn to live with that, because life is filled with mundane work.  But I&#x27;ve always been able to make money coding, etc. and loved every minute of it.  I honestly feel like Uni is &quot;harshing on my vibe, man&quot; if you know what I mean.

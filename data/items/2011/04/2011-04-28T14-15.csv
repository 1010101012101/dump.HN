2493557,story,,,8,0,egb,"Ask HN: Any AdMob folks I could talk to? Trying to clean up an iPad FUBAR",,"I launched a new iPad game this past Monday night, and it did reasonably well on Tuesday for a free game (3000 downloads) but I noticed that my ad revenue seemed a bit higher than I had expected.  At first I thought this was good news, but then my wife pointed out some errantic blinking of the AdMob ads.  It was hard to tell, but it looked like it was refreshing the banners too fast.<p>Yup, bug in my production code.  Hard to debug, because hooking up XCode to an iPad and running a debug version of my app makes test iAds show up instead of real ones, and the bug in my client-side mediation code was triggered by iAds' low fill rate causing flip-flopping between showing iAds and AdMob.  Net result, every time it flipped over to AdMob, I started a new refresh timer that fired every 60 seconds.  :-\  Arg!<p>At 1:30 am I deleted the AdMob app ID for this app to stop the ads from showing up, and so now all is quiet.  I went ahead and emailed AdMob through their contact form, but my gut is churning in fear that I'll still be auto-banned for this, even though I asked to have the revenue from this incident (not much, around $50 I think) removed from my account.<p>Are there any AdMob-ers or Googlers that know the right people that could hook me up with someone to talk to about this incident to help me do whatever needs to be done to clean this up?<p>I'm trying to do the right thing here - not trying to blow TOS or cheat as this is my full-time job.<p>Thanks for your help, and sorry for the long ramble :-)",1304002588

And not just for us but for tens of thousands of bloggers, podcasters, developers, designers and other creators out there. Just ask Tim. Were now making an important change to the service, one which should open the floodgates of Flattr, if you will.<p>From May 1st we no longer require users to flattr others before they can be flattrd. Or in other words, its not mandatory to add money to your account to have an active Flattr button.
How does this affect you?<p>If youre mainly using Flattr to make payments you will soon have much more content to flattr.<p>If youre using Flattr both to make and receive payments then you no longer need to check your balance at the end of each month to see whether your Flattr button is still active or not. It is and always will be.<p>If your Flattr button was once deactivated because balance dropped to zero, it is now active again. Forever.<p>This makes Flattr simpler<p>We have good reasons for making this change and weve just added a post about it on our blog. In a nutshell, we just didnt need to force the give before you get principle onto people. During the the last year weve learned that people want to flattr the content they like and therefore we decided to drop any rules that made the service restrictive or outright complicated.<p>We hope youll like the simpler more straightforward Flattr. If you have any comments, questions or feedback please get in touch via our blog or support page.<p>Linus, Peter and the rest of Flattr team",1304002473

In places where no value is a real error, you return nil. Either value can be converted to the other with a one-line statement, and to existing code, null looks like nil when queried (i.e., isNil returns true, ifNil: and ifNotNil: and friends behave as if null were nil, etc.).<p>Seems as if writing a similar tool for Ruby would be trivial.",1304001324

So that means I can add a half pound chop to my dinner for only $1.25.  I also tend to stock up frozen chicken breasts, which I don't remember the cost of since a big back of those lasts me a long time.  But I usually end up eating one pork item and one chicken item a day, alternating between lunch and dinner.  I'd say in total my daily meals are $4-$6.

I think they are suggesting that innate heritable intelligence isn't as predictive of life outcomes as previously thought because part of what was being measured was motivation to do well on IQ tests.<p>In other words, two people could be born with the same innate intelligence, but one of the two could be more motivated and do better in both IQ tests and life outcomes. Previously people would've attributed the difference in life outcomes to a difference in innate intelligence.  It still seems like IQ would be an interesting number to look at, but it isn't quite measuring what people believed it was measuring.",1303999538

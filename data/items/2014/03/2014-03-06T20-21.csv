7356542,comment,7355449,7356447,6,0,bdhe,,,"Agreed. It is an interesting article to read. The survey cited is also interesting in its own right [1]. We often forget that ideas we find trivial and intuitive are only so because it took the work of many more people and centuries to hone their ideas which at that time would be have been new and ambiguous. This is especially true with mathematics because a lot of the field focuses on getting the right abstractions to complex ideas which when done correctly seem &quot;trivial, natural, and straightforward.&quot; Also see the history of calculus [2].<p>[1] <a href=""https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/journals/JIS/VOL15/Caldwell1/cald5.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/journals/JIS/VOL15/Caldwell1/cald5.p...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_calculus"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_calculus</a>",1394139595

How should one act to aid the transition towards the ideal state?<p>To explain the individual you are describing who is anti-federal government but works for the federal government, there are a number of hypothetical people we can imagine.<p>For example, one could believe that in the ideal state there is no organization of power at the global or federal government level (#1). But they could also believe that (#3) there is nothing an individual can do to speed up that transition in any meaningful way. They may be waiting for some cultural evolution of humanity or a game-changing shift in technology (e.g. unlimited free access to power).<p>Or they could believe that the way to transition is by participating to ensure that it does as little evil as possible- or they could even be actively undermining the system from within.

I can see why - the ones that do tend to go through the slides way too fast, because they have nothing to slow them down. It promotes assuming the students know more than they actually do know too, and the danger of skipping slides.<p>On note taking: I just got a surface pro and aside from the handwriting being a little sloppy, I wish I started using a tablet PC years ago. As a friend that has done so put it, he has his notes archived from every class he&#x27;s ever taken in folders on his computer. I only keep about a year of old notes/materials because it takes a ton of space when you do it on paper!<p>On ebooks: I like them if they&#x27;re cheap/free. Frankly I&#x27;d rather the teachers just use public domain books or class wikis instead of assigning stuff out of a $150 textbook that nobody ever needs to read otherwise.<p>On typing: I grew up typing, we didn&#x27;t have a computer at home until I was 9 (and I&#x27;m in my 20s), but we always had a typewriter, and when I saw my mom using it, I learned how to use it too! By the time I was around 10, I could already touch type without looking at the keyboard, and that fact randomly dawned on me one day lol. Right now I can type around 140wpm max.<p>On microsoft word: lol, my first computer was a 286 that was as old as I was. It ran WordPerfect and Lotus123. Yes, I used it to write a report, and yes I printed it on a giant dot matrix printer. It was awesome!<p>As for primary school: It has by a lot. The standardized testing and ACT/SAT stuff, especially in high schools, has made the top end crazy advanced. Students are under pressure to graduate having taken calculus, chemistry, physics - all things that for the most part weren&#x27;t even options in my high school.

You can mix text and images with a breathtaking fluidity, with colour switching whenever you like. You can take the piece of paper and fold it, roll it, punch holes in it, spill things on it, it just keeps on going. The format hasn&#x27;t changed for centuries, and won&#x27;t change for centuries to come, essentially because it&#x27;s near perfect - people will be able to view marking on paper, made today, for centuries to come.<p>You can mix and match your pens and paper without any fear of interface problems - a pen bought a century ago in Germany will work with paper made next year in Argentina. You can even pick up a piece of paper that a different pen was using, and carry on adding to the content with whatever pen or pencil you&#x27;ve got in your pocket. It&#x27;s a complete, self-contained information display system. I could hand a piece of paper I wrote on to someone from the other side of the world and they&#x27;d be able to use it.<p>Anything looking to replace pen and paper is going to have to be seriously amazing.

I&#x27;m not against a right to privacy, which is why I said I&#x27;m in favor of a constitutional amendment to make it explicit. I&#x27;m saying that you don&#x27;t have a comprehensive right to privacy now. Moral rights are what you want, legal rights are what you actually have.<p>I <i>don&#x27;t</i> thinkt eh right to privacy is entirely unilateral; if it were, journalism could not exist, and the Constitution also forbids the government from abridging the freedom of the press - which includes the freedom to inquire as well as to publish. I personally would narrow the scope of press freedom if I were drafting constitution 2.0, because I believe publishers often exploit the economic asymmetry between themselves and their subjects to the detriment of ordinary people in a manner that the framers of the constitution were unable to envision, but there you go.",1394136188

The initial smoking of DMT can be uncomfortable but with a proper dosage it typically causes a very positive feeling but not in the sense of any stimulant.  It feels natural, loving and you can forget you have a body.<p>Salvia can have horrendous negative feelings.   A smaller dosage of DMT can produce slight anxiety.  Of course, these are anecdotal experiences but I&#x27;d warn against using salvia.<p>I would caution against Ayahuasca too as it&#x27;s intense, last hours and can be very negative unlike smoking DMT.",1394136169

It sounds like exchange theft is pretty much a solved problem. Using crypto, we now have ways to make theft or coin loss pretty much a problem of the past, because we can make operating a fractional reserve exchange impossible and make stealing coins very, very hard. It seems like cryptographic regulation is drastically more effective than government regulation.",1394136162

If you distribute some items to regional hubs, there&#x27;s a (wasted) cost to doing that too, especially if you ship more or less than is actually needed. They try to estimate what items go where based on their historical data: what people buy where and how often. They could speculatively do this with &quot;people who buy this will often buy that&quot; data too.<p>In this case, they look at the cost of returning an excess item from a regional hub to an upstream distribution center and try to recoup the cost by selling to someone near it&#x27;s current location at a discount that is less than the cost of moving it around further.",1394136014

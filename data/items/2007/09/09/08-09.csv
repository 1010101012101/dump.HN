So they do prioritize to some extent. <p>In the Silicon Valley area, I've seen more in-town speed traps than on the freeway; I received one citation for 40 in a 25mph zone, and had other close calls. Maybe it's different where you live. <p>""...should be concentrating on tail gating, should be prosecuting inattentive drivers, ticketing drivers with no lane control etc etc.""\nThey probably don't do this as much as these violations are more subjective and harder to prove in court. Also there's some correlation between people who speed and people who tail-gate, etc.",1189328164

I believe the speed traps do more good than harm.<p>You have to admit that this service's tag line ""find cops before they find you"" does make the user sound like a criminal :). They've gotta change that.",1189326325

However, it seems a certain amount of distractions and randomness are needed for any truly great creative thinking. I think the goal is to balance the two. Therefore, if adding discipline to one area of your life might help it could be totally worth it, like how Einstein would wear identical clothing everyday to free his mind from the business of deciding what to wear...",1189324929

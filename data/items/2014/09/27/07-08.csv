8376393,comment,8376080,8376112,5,0,jleader,,,"I&#x27;ve never been a &quot;real&quot; sysadmin, but back in the mid 80s I learned that anything you don&#x27;t practice doing regularly will inevitably be painful.<p>I was working as a developer at Unisys (or it might have still been Burroughs), down the hall from the OS developers (for one of Burroughs&#x27; 3 distinct mainframe product lines, each with its own cpu architecture, operating system, system software, etc.). At that time, our mainframes could be patched while running, without re-booting; re-booting was considerably slower than patching. As a result, as each new OS patch was developed, it was applied on the fly to the machines in our dev environment, and they hadn&#x27;t been rebooted for something like six months. It turned out that it was possible to have a sequence of patches, which when applied on the fly to a running system caused no problems, except that when it came time to reboot, it would crash. You can imagine the fun of trying to debug which change (or combination of several changes), out of many months of development work, had broken the boot process! These dev machines were shared with other teams (compiler developers, database engine developers, etc.), so the productivity hit waiting for our dev machines to be available again was substantial. After that, the policy was that the OS developers took turns coming in early one morning a week to reboot the dev machines, so in the worst case they&#x27;d only have to track down which of the last week&#x27;s worth of patches might have broken the boot process.",1411804618

8376382,comment,8376131,8376310,2,0,hyp0,,,"Better off, because I could have learnt the conventional axioms as a skill, like the perceptual and motor skills comprising reading, writing, arithmetic. And only later question them.<p>My &quot;optimism&quot; is more for my intuition; working code is experimental confirmation.<p>It&#x27;s easier to be optimistic about code than proofs. Firstly, working code only needs to work in the specific cases you&#x27;re using (that you test for); but a proof must work in every possible case. Thus, working code is simpler and easier to check, because it&#x27;s aiming at less. My code almost always confirms my intuition.<p>Yes, it&#x27;s also helpful to have the automatic, mechanical check of executable code; and as you say, this relies on compilers, OSes, silicon, hardware.  (Though, anecdotally, I have noticed subtle problems that I eventually diagnosed and confirmed to be compiler and hardware bugs.) BTW, yes I have tried COQ (proof assistant; somewhat mechanical proof checking), but simple ideas become very complex to prove, and the problem of bugs in COQ itself etc is of greater concern, for the next reason:<p>Secondly, and relatedly, is that the <i>standard</i> is much lower for code. It just needs to work. Whereas a mathematical proof is supposed to be absolutely true. In other words, I don&#x27;t ask as much from code. If there turns out to be a bug, it&#x27;s just learning more about the problem; about the world. It&#x27;s an engineering flaw.\nBut if my proof is wrong, the game is lost.<p>An argument against my intuition is probably more telling. Though my faith in it has turned out to be justified many many times, I certainly can be wrong. My only real excuse is that, as a human being, I have nothing else to fall back on but my <i>sense</i> of reality and reason. That&#x27;s my hardware; if it&#x27;s wrong, I really am lost. So I might as well trust it.\nFortunately, it&#x27;s almost always right; probably because I try to see things from many angles and check them in many ways before my intutive sense is fully formed.",1411804270

For instance an instruction can be read from the data pins into the instruction logic at the same time that data is being copied between the ALU and registers.</i><p>Essentially pipelining, several years before the RISC movement popularised it? Could the Z80 have been one of the first pipelined single-chip CPUs?<p>That was a very interesting article. I&#x27;ve tried staring at the Visual6502 chip images for a long time, and although I understand the principles behind how diffusion/polysilicon/metal layers are put together to form transistors, for some reason I feel absolutely lost trying to follow the connections and find the borders between the regions especially when one layer is hidden beneath another.<p>Even looking at the NOR gate with its layout side-by-side I can&#x27;t see much beyond the metal layer, despite it being partially transparent. I have no problems with transistor-level schematics, however. Is there some sort of trick to being able to easily read and follow the circuitry in die images and layout-level diagrams?

Most of the servers I deal with have only a handful of daemons running concurrently, and of those, maybe only a couple of daemons have interdependencies, and of those, they don&#x27;t seem to have much trouble polling each other and coordinating startup. I mean, from the software developer&#x27;s perspective, it&#x27;s probably not fun to write that polling code and get it exactly right. But from the sysadmin&#x27;s perspective, this doesn&#x27;t seem to be enough of a real-world problem to justify the adoption of systemd.<p>(I am not a fan of systemd, but I&#x27;m being neutral here because I won&#x27;t learn anything if I dismiss it -- so hopefully someone will give an equally fair response.)",1411803408

8376351,comment,8374091,8374091,1,0,EddyTaylor,,,"Hi Everyone,<p>I truly appreciate and agree with this article. If we are not giving time to our loved ones and only lost in this corporate world, what is the sense of making money? For whom we are working night and day? It would be selfishness if our priority is only our work. For me, family is the most important thing than comes your work. Read this short story and I think it will affect you guys too.<p>One day, an expert in time management was speaking to a group of business students and, to drive home a point, used an illustration those students will never forget. As he stood in front of the group of high-powered over-achievers he said, &quot;Okay, time for a quiz&quot; and he pulled out a one-gallon, wide-mouth mason jar and set it on the table in front of him. He also produced about a dozen fist-sized rocks and carefully placed them, one at a time, into the jar. When the jar was filled to the top and no more rocks would fit inside, he asked, &quot;Is this jar full?&quot; Everyone in the class yelled, &quot;Yes.&quot; The time management expert replied, &quot;Really?&quot; He reached under the table and pulled out a bucket of gravel. He dumped some gravel in and shook the jar causing pieces of gravel to work themselves down into the spaces between the big rocks. He then asked the group once more, &quot;Is the jar full?&quot; By this time the class was on to him. &quot;Probably not,&quot; one of them answered. &quot;Good!&quot; he replied. He reached under the table and brought out a bucket of sand. He started dumping the sand in the jar and it went into all of the spaces left between the rocks and the gravel. Once more he asked the question, &quot;Is this jar full?&quot; &quot;No!&quot; the class shouted. Once again he said, &quot;Good.&quot; Then he grabbed a pitcher of water and began to pour it in until the jar was filled to the brim. Then he looked at the class and asked, &quot;What is the point of this illustration?&quot; One eager beaver raised his hand and said, &quot;The point is, no matter how full your schedule is, if you try really hard you can always fit some more things in it!&quot; &quot;No,&quot; the speaker replied, &quot;that&#x27;s not the point. The truth this illustration teaches us is, &quot;If you don&#x27;t put the big rocks in first, you&#x27;ll never get them in at all. What are the &#x27;big rocks&#x27; in your life, time with loved ones, your faith, your education, your dreams, a worthy cause, teaching or mentoring others? Remember to put these BIG ROCKS in first or you&#x27;ll never get them in at all. So, tonight, or in the morning, when you are reflecting on this short story, ask yourself this question, &quot;What are the &#x27;big rocks&#x27; in my life?&quot; Then, put those in your jar first.\nIf this inspired you, share with others so they can benefit!\uFEFF",1411802489

Now, take a codebase which does the exact same thing, but where the god function is split into smaller and smaller functions depending on the complexity.

Not that MongoDB is a bad database, but it has it&#x27;s fair share of issues.

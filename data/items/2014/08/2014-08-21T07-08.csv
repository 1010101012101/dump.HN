8206329,comment,8205902,8205902,6,0,tomcam,,,"I was a late starter and I am a slow learner. I was desperate to get into the computer field but couldn&#x27;t afford college. When I saw the friendly September 1983 cover in a Crown bookstore I instinctively felt like I was home.<p>Back in those days you could find lots of recycled crap by authors who knew nothing but how to cash in on the microcomputer craze, or tons of abstruse theory without any examples. COMPUTE fixed both problems, teaching the theory behind the code it presented while staying accessible.<p>COMPUTE shepherded me to what has been to me an enormously successful career (great jobs, fascinating work, complete independence, no debt, the ability to take care of two medically expensive children, and my house paid for).<p>The writing was lively. It was actually edited. Even the colors and illustration were buoyant but not condescending.<p>The best programs in those days were written in assembly, but assembly listings were way too long, no one knew assembly, and no one could afford an assembler. So most magazines had to repurpose Hangman and Hunt the Wumpus every third article.<p>COMPUTE&#x27;s innovative answer was MSX, which allowed users the ability to get a professionally created machine language program without having to subscribe to expensive online resources or to mail in for an expensive floppy disk.<p>MSX was ingenious and no other magazine had anything like it. It was a short BASIC program you would use to enter the numbers shown (not the first column). The two-digit columns were converted by MSXX to a binary executable. It then wrote the program straight into memory. You could then save your finished program on tape or disk.<p>The rewards could be splendid. The December issue shown on the right featured Speedscript, a good enough word processor that I was able to make a living with it for years as a technical writer. (Had to hook up an electric typewriter to my PC via a parallel interface gizmo.) Yes, it took me probably 4 hours to enter, but I was literally able to earn a living with it.<p>Another revolutionary program was Laser Chess. It spawned many imitators, some thriving to this day. I confess I never played it because I was actually too jealous, despite a lifelong interest in strategy games. The game was so good, it just hurt too much.<p>empressplay&#x27;s remark about checksum problems is sort of true. It had a crude checksum feature that worked line by line, and occasionally a false positive went through, requiring you to spend a few hours retyping the program. Stil, the only other way you could find new apps this good was to pay way more than the price of a magazine.<p>COMPUTE actually paid decently, so you even saw people like Orson Scott Card on the payroll. He edited one of my articles but I hadn&#x27;t read Enders Game. My editor Clifton Karnes is and always was both a first-rate programmer and commercial-quality graphic artist, and was a wonderful editor to boot.<p>I&#x27;ve made lots of money, bought way too many guitars, and got to work at one of the greatest companies in the world (Microsoft&#x27;s dev tools division at their peak), but few things were as thrilling as when I became a writer and then columnist for COMPUTE! It had given so much to me--literally, a dream career in very dark times--that I still grateful to be a part of their history.<p>RIP, COMPUTE! And thank you for 30+ years of working awesome jobs, all of which may have gone into the bitbucket without that first September 1983 issue.",1408607955

I don&#x27;t have an investor breathing down my neck looking for &quot;explosive&quot; growth.<p>3) It complicates the product roadmap.

You know, a greenhouse works because glass is transparent to visible and near IR radiation, but is quite opaque to far IR. Visible light is the peak of the spectrum of solar e.m. radiation and its frequency is proportional to the temperature of the sun photosphere (~6000 K). Visible and near IR radiations traverse the glass, gets absorbed by objects and heat them. Part of this heat will be re-emitted as far IR radiation, with a frequency proportional to room temperature (~300 K), which is 20 times smaller than visible light. This factor 20 is enough for the glass to turn from transparent to opaque.

I didn&#x27;t have an account for the first several months I was using it, but I would just remember the Artists I like and listen to their profiles/likes. Not being able to remember songs and artist names motivated me to make an account and start following them, and liking the songs I wanted to hear again, reblogging the ones I want to share with others...

So people that build <i>hulls</i> (not the superstructure, let&#x27;s take that as a given) out of titanium tend to make those hulls fairly thin. Containers are made out of thick chunks of angle and square profile welded together, with huge sheets of steel in a double wall in order to make the structure rigid. So rigid that you can stack them 10 to 15 high <i>loaded</i> without any of them buckling.<p>If you ram something like that (at it&#x27;s own velocity, which will be roughly the speed of the current) at a vessel made out of titanium (thin, because it is expensive) then you&#x27;re essentially aiming a can opener at a can.<p>I&#x27;m really happy that you&#x27;re extremely confident of the design but I really hope you&#x27;re going to do the normal thing and run with the regular complement of safety gear on board for the crew (raft, vests etc) because I fear that you may be over-estimating the degree to which oceanside encounters with container sized semi submerged obstacles weighing multiple tons allow themselves to be predicted.<p>FTR my somewhat checkered career included working for a sail making company and I&#x27;ve seen a few boats that had <i>very</i> mild collisions at sea and on the larger lakes and those definitely did not look pretty. I&#x27;ve never seen a boat come back that had had a head-on encounter with something the size of a container.<p>Titanium is a great material, but it is (very) hard to work, if used properly can give you the same strength as steel for a lighter weight. But due to the higher material costs and higher costs to work it you will more than likely end up with a boat that is just as expensive as a steel one with slightly less displacement or you&#x27;ll end up with a boat that is <i>much</i> more expensive than a steel one.<p>In the end whether or not you will survive a container encounter depends to a very large degree on what the relative velocities are and how the container is oriented relative to your boat. If the container is dead in the water and you hit it at a 45 degree angle no amount of metallurgy will stop you from having a breached hull unless you go for something that will also survive impact with an iceberg.<p>Which reminds me of some other captain that was convinced his boat could handle anything the ocean could throw at him.<p>Be safe.",1408605223

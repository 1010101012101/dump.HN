Every word is converted into a wordID by using an in-memory hash table -- the lexicon. New additions to the lexicon hash table are logged to a file. Once the words are converted into wordID's, their occurrences in the current document are translated into hit lists and are written into the forward barrels. The main difficulty with parallelization of the indexing phase is that the lexicon needs to be shared. Instead of sharing the lexicon, we took the approach of writing a log of all the extra words that were not in a base lexicon, which we fixed at 14 million words. That way multiple indexers can run in parallel and then the small log file of extra words can be processed by one final indexer.<p>So we have a hash table of words/searches -> results<p>Because we have this, we can regex search the keys, and end up with the result pages.<p>we do have other options though. It could be:<p>a) magic\nb) a trade secret (think PidgeonRank :-) )",1247007288

692783,comment,692735,692735,0,0,sarvesh,,,".Net isn't the most terrible framework but it comes with a lot of baggage and some technical problems that would deter startups from using it.<p>On the web development side ASP.Net is really hard compared to other frameworks out there. Until ASP.Net MVC, there wasn't a quick and easy method to implement URL rewriting for example. On the ORM side they seem to be changing their mind every year they ditched Linq to SQL in favor Entity Framework which really doesn't work as seamlessly as they make it out to be.\nAdd to this the fact the startup has to buy licenses for the server, the costs add up as you scale up. I know there is Mono but there it isn't easy to port everything to it, the implementation isn't exactly complete.<p>.Net has its place for example if you are writing a Windows only desktop application .Net is by far the easiest framework MS had to support it. I believe Xobini uses .Net. Again writing cross platform desktop applications doesn't look as appealing to me.

That way, it won't show up as an unsuccessful login attempt for any log-monitoring tools which add its IP address to hosts.deny.<p>However, after it's done that repeatedly (presumably doing some sort of sniffing to work out exactly which version of sshd is running), it then attempts to login.

I'm not particularly au fait with the internals of sshd, but I would suspect that this new (well, if it is new) script has found an exploit in the part of SSHD which (logically) checks if a user exists first, but the login is being rejected deeper in sshd, when it tries to do the actual authentication.<p>(All the above is speculation, however: I'm no expert on SSH)",1247006742

Not an exact index, but it will allow you to quickly eliminate a large number of documents.<p>You can also combine this approach with text-based ones for the cases where there are parts of the search regex that contain literal text. (This is almost certainly the most common use case).<p>Or you could make it hierarchical if you need to by creating several watered-down texts for each input with different levels of substitution.<p>---------------------------------------------------<p>Since this is the sort of thing that's fun to think about, here's a whole different approach:<p>- Break each document apart into code lines.<p>- Create a hierarchical tree: leaves are the code snippets (with a pointer back to source doc), each node represents a clustering-by-text-similarity of all its children. (Appropriate distance measure left as an exercise for the reader. :) )<p>- Let's say that for two regular expressions, <i>RA</i> & <i>RB</i>, <i>RA</i> < <i>RB</i> iff any text matched by <i>RA</i> will also be matched by <i>RB</i>.<p>- At each node, create a regular expression <i>R</i> so that for each child regex <i>C</i>, <i>C</i> < <i>R</i>. (The leaves become a regex that simply matches the source line literally.) Along the way, make a best effort to restrict the length of <i>R</i> by introducing generalizations (<i>R</i> can't simply be <i>Ca</i>|<i>Cb</i>|<i>Cc</i>...) without making it so loose that it matches everything.<p>- Then, searching for a regex <i>S</i> can be done recursively: For each child regex <i>R</i> of the current node, if you can construct a new regex <i>T</i> such that <i>T</i> < <i>S</i> and <i>T</i> < <i>R</i>, descend into that node.<p>n.b. I typed that out in a hurry and without being rigorous... so it's probably not quite right, but an interesting path to think about exploring. Also: testing if one regex is less than another (as defined above) is actually fairly straightforward, even though it seems hard.<p>(And a quick edit to add: the last step is definitely wrong. Unfortunately I need to hop onto a conference call, so it'll have to wait until the indefinite future.)<p>(Edit to that: I think I fixed it for now. Shorter version: if the intersection of <i>S</i> and <i>R</i> is nonempty, descend.)",1247006641

With audio, complex realtime input can result in all kinds of nonlinear distortions. This can be fun if you like crunchy sounds, but  it can also spiral out of control.

The lectures were in a massive lecture theatre, about 100 to 200 people in. I asked a question once, are psychopaths born or made, the lecturer could not hear it, so I had to repeat myself 15 times, until the whole students in the lecture room started repeating it with me. Having this kind of experience puts you well off because you are supposed to make the question and move the spot light back to the lecturer straight away, not have all eyes on yourself and hold the room for long.<p>At least that was an event, something to remember and the lecturer appreciated my question, the rest of the year however was a rehashing of the book chapters in a powerpoint with a dummy and high tech ""stick"". To be honest, if I want the content in audio, I'll just read it out loud myself.<p>Those people who need lectures should not be in university, this will allow universities to have the resources to actually teach through inquisitive inquiry, not make their students sit there listening to what you already just read for two hours, which starts to become torture after 30 mins.<p>I find it idiotic - to use the Greek word - that although the method of teaching in Oxbridge is considered to be the best, the other universities do not copy them. Neither of those two universities has lectures, the theme is rather tutoring, which is afterall why one would go to university, to challenge his intellect, not to have some person say aloud what you just read.",1247004368

You're the one working on the startup and only you know what it means to you.  You are the one in your relationship and only you know what that means to you. If you are willing to lose the relationship in order to dedicate more time to the startup, than there's your decision. If you want to keep the relationship, then you need to talk to you girlfriend and figure out exactly what she needs, because that will be necessary in order to make the relationship successful. If you work something out, great. If not, then go with what you know even if it's difficult. We can't tell you what the right answer is, because there is no right answer. There are only answers that you are willing to accept and live with.<p>Yes, it's a tough decision. I am in the same boat. I just recently (LAST WEEK) moved to a new state in order to be with my girlfriend. I now must work with my startup co-founders remotely and deal with the disadvantages that come with working remotely. But the fact of the matter is, my relationship is important enough to me that I was willing to make certain sacrifices in order to make it successful. But being that I still want the startup to work, I'm also willing to go above and beyond what I was doing before to make up for the long distance disadvantages. It doesn't have to be black or white, relationships are about compromise. As long as you are both open and getting what you want most, then you should be able to work through the other stuff.<p>And just so you know, a startup isn't necessarily the best way to achieve financial success. They are risky and rarely work out. They take lots of time and often there is little payout until well down the line, if any.<p>And in a startup, success is not dictated by the number of hours you put in. It's all about efficiency of time and execution. Even someone with the best idea who works ridiculous hours is not guaranteed success if they can't work efficiently and execute effectively. Working on these 2 things could help you with both areas of your life, become successful more quickly and give you more time to hang with your girl. Give those a try.<p>FYI, it looks like you could use English lessons too...not that you need anymore on your plate :)",1247004262

What job are they doing? Who&#x27;s paying them? If they&#x27;re making money off it, then yes, they probably should be deported. If they&#x27;re doing work someone else could be making money off of, they should also probably be deported.<p>> <i>For that matter, if I travel, and happen to do work while in another country that would also be in violation of immigration laws?</i><p>You would have to consult the laws of the other country in question. I&#x27;m sure the only way you could even possibly hope to make this argument in the US is if the company has no US suppliers, customers, or other US-related interests whatsoever. But even that is extremely doubtful.<p>The general rule for immigration is this: If it&#x27;s not authorized, it&#x27;s unauthorized. Unless you have clearly and unambiguously established that it&#x27;s authorized, don&#x27;t do it.<p>> <i>I guess at least visiting heads of state get a diplomatic waver...</i><p>Hardly.

6392590,comment,6389293,6391204,1,0,benjamincburns,,,"> You can take deliberate steps to lower the stakes in your interview process by changing the kinds of transactions that happen in the interview (for instance, by constructing interviews that involve collaborating on a problem instead of challenging the candidate).<p>If you want to evaluate all candidates on a level playing field, this can be really hard to pull off.<p>I work in the defense sector. We have some pretty strict guidelines on how we&#x27;re supposed to evaluate people. Because of those guidelines, we often try to give each batch of candidates the same general set of questions/challenges, etc. We do try to be collaborative during our interviews, but it&#x27;s <i>really</i> tough to collaborate without leading when you&#x27;ve worked a particular problem 1,000 times.<p>Further, even when you do this well, the candidate often interprets your help as their failure. &quot;Oh crap, he pointed me in a different direction, he must think I&#x27;m an idiot.&quot;<p>> You can push more of the recruiting process into situations where the candidate controls their environment (for instance, by doing stuff at home, and on a fixed but flexible time scale) and less on in-person timeboxed interviews.<p>I think this is <i>really</i> key to our success. Our interview focuses on two programming problems which require you to interpret imperfect requirements, ask questions if you deem it necessary, provide an estimate of when you think you&#x27;ll complete your work, code/document/test two full applications (one per problem). We ask the candidate to do this well before the interview, on their own time. Typically we don&#x27;t discount for how long it takes a candidate to complete their work. I&#x27;ve had awful submissions which took someone 40 hours, and excellent submissions which took someone 4 hours, and vice versa.",1379329009

I realize that she&#x27;s joking here with the creepy bit, but I have to ask. Does anyone honestly think this kind of behavior is creepy?<p>To answer my own question, as someone who interviews people quite often, I&#x27;d love to hear that a candidate did this sort of thing. Honestly, if you&#x27;re worried that you&#x27;re going to be weak in your interview for a company which you really want to work for, do <i>this</i>.<p>Oh, and also - if interviews make you nervous, please tell your interviewer. For some people it&#x27;s really obvious that they&#x27;re nervous, but others do an amazing job hiding it. If there&#x27;s any chance at all that you think your interviewers aren&#x27;t aware of your nerves, just tell them.<p>First off, we&#x27;re used to it. I&#x27;d guess somewhere between 60 to 80% of my interviewees are visibly nervous. Further, quite often the people interviewing you experience the same sort of nervousness when they&#x27;re on your side of the table. If they&#x27;re good at what they&#x27;re doing, they&#x27;ll totally empathize, and clearing the air helps a lot.<p>Unless you&#x27;re interviewing for a sales type position where it&#x27;s essentially your job to be interviewed, nobody in their right mind should view nervousness as a sign of weakness. Personally, about 9 out of 10 times this happens I err on the side of &quot;this person really wants this job&quot; rather than &quot;wow, this person must be nervous because they don&#x27;t know their shit.&quot;",1379328351

I'd argue that it's similar for something like programming. I think you'll find that some people lack the mental acuity or analytical reasoning skills to be in the top 5% of programmers. Those skills can be taught to a certain extent, I suppose, but I don't doubt you'll find people that would plateau well before breaking into ""expert"" territory. You'd likely find the same for someone trying to reach that point in golf or any other number of skills.<p>Do <i>most</i> people lack those necessary skills? I'm not really sure.<p>[1]: For the purpose of the argument, ignore prosthetics. AFAIK, there isn't anything similar to prosthetics for someone that lacks certain necessary abilities to be an ""expert"" programmer.",1302659966

2440357,comment,2440054,2440227,3,0,lsc,,,">You cannot possibly be a credible entrepreneur with such a negligent, even reckless attitude towards money<p>As far as I can tell, having a little bit of recklessness is /required/ -  I mean, when you start a funded startup, you go in with a 9 out of 10 chance of corporate bankruptcy;  and that's not even your own money.   If you personally co-sign anything big, you have a pretty good chance of personal bankruptcy.  (and if you are a bootstrapper, in most industries, you won't be able to get very far without personally co-signing anything.)<p>I think the biggest difference between myself and my peers who have chosen the employee path is that I have more risk tolerance.  I am comparatively reckless.   I mean, what else can you call it when you turn down a very comfortable living as an Engineer at a large company for a small chance of making your marginal dollar worth, ah, very little?<p>I mean, I'm bootstrapped, and fortunately was able to pay off my mistakes that caused big debt without bankruptcy, mostly because I am able to charge reasonable rates as a contractor, but this willingness to risk financial ruin is absolutely /essential/ if you want to run a small company.<p>But, you say, most debt incurred as a entrepreneur can be dealt with through bankruptcy!   Which is true... most.  but if you screw up your taxes?  It's pretty easy to get a low-margin, high revenue business going.  If the IRS disagrees about what constitutes a profit, you can get in deep trouble rather quickly.   Tax law is subtle and complex;  it's not like most things in business or technology where you can try it and see what sticks;   with taxes, you pay what you think you owe, then a few years later, maybe the IRS checks up on you, and maybe they don't.   Maybe they agree with your calculations of what you owe... and maybe they don't.<p>I mean, personally, I have a professional handle as much of that as possible, just 'cause I see this as the largest downside risk to my future financial state.   (The idea of becoming destitute, of having no money doesn't really scare me that much.  I've been there before, and while I try to avoid that state, it's not terrifying.  The idea of having tens or hundreds of thousands of dollars in debt and no resources?  /that/ frightens me.)<p>I mean, right now I'm largely debt free, but if some disaster brought my business to a halt tomorrow?  I'd have about $50K in data center leases I'm personally on the hook for, and at least that much in customer pre-payments.   (on the other hand, my hardware would pay for that if I could get a good price for it, but usually desperate sellers get desperate prices.)<p>Now, sure, the op needs to be more careful.   And maybe the OP isn't careful enough to be an entrepreneur?  I mean, obviously, there is a level of carelessness that goes beyond ""risk tolerance"" and starts becoming harmful.<p>My point is just that /if/ you want to be an entrepreneur, you risk taking on this kind of debit and worse.<p>When I had my own debt issues (which were largely caused by me signing long leases for resources I'd only need if the product took off, then the product failed miserably.   Big mistake)  I ended up contracting myself out and running the business sort of in 'degraded mode'  - while paying down the debt.  It's still an open question if it would have been better for me to close up shop and declare corporate and personal bankruptcy, but it's a moot point now.<p>I think the most important bit of advice for the OP is to /do something/ about the debt.    Talk to a professional in the area, perhaps?  But yeah, just ignoring the problem is often the worst choice.  On the other hand, the people I know who lost their shirts in entrepreneurship; who ended up with huge debits (relative to their earning power)  to the IRS?  they largely ended up ignoring the problem, and ended up just not having credit or significant assets ever.   I mean, even the IRS isn't going to prevent you from eating, and it's quite possible to live a college student level lifestyle without credit at all.<p>I would bet money that Entrepreneurs have much higher median levels of debit compared to people with similar skillsets working for other people.",1302659898

 * Cheap enough so you won't cry when it dies.  
 * Cheap enough so you can buy multiple for different purposes.<p>In fact, my favorite MP3 player of all time is a 2nd Generation iPod shuffle. It's lasted for years, it survived going through a washing machine, and it's tiny.<p>OTOH, I'll argue that a good MP3 player isn't a ""cheap single-purpose device"", it's just a quality single-purpose device that happens to be inexpensive. The price of all MP3 players are so low that the difference between a really ""good"" one and a really ""cheap"" one is 20 bucks.<p>You can't say the same thing about still or video cameras. The ""cheap"" Flip camera has less utility than the camera on my smartphone for one reason only: I always have my smartphone on me.<p>I think stand-alone GPS devices are the next thing that will be obsoleted by smartphones.

Sometimes those people get into management positions, and when they do their groups seem to develop really wide pay ranges for the same amount of work. If you're a senior manager and one of your managers is trying to get points because ""I can convince him to join for half what the last guy cost."" then you need to jump on that problem right away.<p>Managers have the challenge when they pay someone $X but they aren't doing the same level or quality of work of someone making $X - $Y. As a manager you have three choices:
1) Bring the lower paid person up to an equivalent level
2) Fire the guy making ""too much"" and replace with someone who is more calibrated to your organization.
3) Engage in a potentially unsuccessful campaign to bring the contribution up of the under performer.<p>Of the three #1 is the ""easy"" one (giving people raises is always pretty easy), #2 is the ""quick"" one (especially if you're in a place where turn over is expected) and #3 is perhaps the biggest gamble (both the opportunity cost of not having the guy perform and the possibility he may never get there). It's one of those things that is different about being a manager vs being an individual contributor.<p>Things are weirder in pre-IPO + post-IPO worlds where people assume that if they are throwing around a bunch of money its because they got it from stock or something. It can be psychologically difficult on someone who has a lot of money due to an IPO but is doing the same ""level"" of work as someone who joined later and got post IPO stock. Harder to manage and harder to deal with morale issues if they start 'resting and vesting'.<p>Google was famous for having a 'personal multiplier' which would adjust your bonus and a 'median salary' for your pay grade but they wouldn't tell you either of those numbers (they made it a policy not too) so it was impossible to back check to see whether or not your bonus reflected your work or was just a beauty contest. When the company won't tell you what the median salary is for your pay grade that should be a red flag.

you can do this by copying, encrypting with new keys for each shared user, and then sending notification of those keys to the user (via some side channel), and then deleting them on your end after they are accessed (you can re-encrypt with the accessor's keys at this point).  You can do a bit better if you leave ""half open"" asymmetric channels (so you can store encrypted messages/keys only the recipient can decrypt), but that might be overkill.<p>> web access
you probably will need to use java (or NaCl) to do this, as javascript tends to be too slow to do asymmetric encryption (the the needed bignum support just isn't there).  If you're willing to wait, it can be done in javascript in ~5 seconds on a desktop PC.<p>> mobile access
Uh, all modern smart phones can do encryption fast enough (well under a second).<p>> password recovery features

Working with private loans is a world different than working with public loans.<p>- Find out if any of your loans have an interest rate more than twice that of other ones (mine surely do). Request a deferment or forebearance on any loans with an interest rate of 4%, and pay all that extra on your loans at 18%.<p>- Umm... there's no easy way out to give up work and create a company.

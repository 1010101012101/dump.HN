One is that, in practice, I doubt that <i>I</i> could be really be happy as a disembodied mind. I am, in fact, rather emotionally attached to my substrate. We enjoy being human -- that's what our brains were designed for, after all -- and even when we're cybernetically enhanced we tend to use that power in amusingly human ways, like World of Warcraft: An incredibly complex electronic simulation of a bunch of people gathering in small bands and tribes to go hunting and kill big animals.<p>The other thing is that humans have <i>long since</i> moved beyond cell colonies. We and our technologies -- books, artifacts, traditions, tools that we can make and pass on to others -- have been creating more durable, predictable institutions for centuries. Of course, an institution, like a university or a corporation, is no longer particularly similar to an individual human, just as an ant colony is not similar to an individual ant. I regard this as further evidence that having a human nature is inextricably linked to being embedded in a mortal human body.",1235080623

I went in the first day, tried to pick a snarky fight with him over James Joyce, and then stayed after class to talk to him about <i>Ulysses</i> and Nabakov's <i>Lolita.</i> (<i>Ulysses</i> is one of my favorite novels.) By the end of the week, he'd recommended two bands to me that I fell in love with; before winter, he lent me his copy of <i>69 Love Songs</i>, which profoundly affected how I looked at music.<p>Later, he was the reason I befriended a kid I'd been at odds with for years, an arrogant film buff. When we started to have extended discussions covering literature, cinema, and music, I started looking for some of the films they were mentioning, and in doing so became close friends with the film kid. It led to one of the best summers of my life, driving around the state in his Wrangler to get a copy of <i>Spaced</i>.<p>(Meanwhile, the class we met in was a half-year course filled with a ton of kids with short attention spans, and he managed to get us to read something like 7-8 books and a ton of short stories, and crammed us with 5 excellent films in between.)<p>How you isolate people like that and identify them, I don't know.

487920,comment,487497,487801,0,0,timf,,,"I think it doesn't matter what your infrastructure looks like, the principles are the same.  You should not rely on a single service to store your data and/or do backups properly for you.<p>For example, I am building an application on top of EC2 (IaaS) and utilizing the nice EBS system with snapshots to S3.<p>This is still a do-it-yourself style in many ways, you still need to understand the database system, read those docs and you still need to test restores etc.  It's not all that different from the Ma.gnolia situation.  The main difference is that you get some nice properties from EBS and S3 redundancy.<p>But even with those nice properties, like hell am I going to hang the crux of my business on S3 snapshots only.  Besides technical failures (there <i>have</i> been S3 data inconsistencies reported), what if they cancel our account?  Etc. etc.<p>Another thing people label ""cloud computing"" is something like Google's appengine (PaaS).  Here, you trust Google entirely to store the data safely in the ""datastore"" but its only integrity that they try to supply you, not backups.  I have never heard of a way to get Google to take snapshots (which are important when you or an attacker delete something that shouldn't have been, etc.).<p>You have to manually back up off of AppEngine, as in:
<a href=""http://code.google.com/appengine/articles/gae_backup_and_restore.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://code.google.com/appengine/articles/gae_backup_and_res...</a><p>But you should do something like that anyhow is my real point.<p>Cloud computing is still a single point of failure because it's a ""single company of failure"".  It may address your SPOF problems with buying and running hardware but I'm seeing people let that throw caution to the wind.  Instead of ""hard disks <i>will</i> fail, know that will <i>need</i> contingency plans"" the situation if you choose to go the cloud computing route would perhaps be ""trust the redundancy system they try and supply but be sure to have a contingency plan because there is always some possibility you will be hosed.""<p>If you're building with something higher level than Google AppEngine, or Engine Yard, etc., the principle still applies.  Even up to the consumer level, look at those people ""building their bookmarks"" at the higher level, they lost a lot of their hard work because they trusted a single company/system.<p>As a business, I don't ever want to put someone in that position where they realize they should not have trusted one system.  That deteriorates any trust they had in our brand and is just shitty all around.  And the only way to begin on that path is to not do that yourself.",1235080278

But given the economic craziness right now, I'd say that (some) dividend paying stocks qualify at black swans. At least the market thinks so, because they value the shares so that annual dividends are 30+% of the share price. The market wouldn't allow 30% ROI per year into perpetuity on a non risky investment.<p>In fact, assuming that the risk free interest rate is at 2%, the Net Present Value of a $1 30% annuity is $15. Which means that the market expects that there is, approximately, a 90% chance of that company going bankrupt in the near future. (Having looked over NRFs books myself, I think that the chance is considerably less than 90%. Which means, I think NRF is undervalued by the market, and hence is a bargain).",1235079030

I'm afraid they're boring - they are cool to read if you're interested in the society, but that comes later on and you start to look for those things yourself. If he's interested in how things really work, then just make sure he knows the difference between exploration and breaking someone's work. The best learning material I have found are pages of people dealing with real security... stuff that you cannot find by googling ""hacking"".<p>That might both give him some new ideas, as well as show who is really considered important. For example, I always thought lcamtuf (<a href=""http://lcamtuf.coredump.cx/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://lcamtuf.coredump.cx/</a>) is a great example of a hacker of many skills (photography, network security, fuzzing, constructing robots with own 3d printer and many more random ideas). I guess you just don't have time to be a script kiddie if you have enough good ideas of your own...<p>Just make sure he finds securityfocus before he finds cDc :)<p>On the other hand you could let him know, that notifying the school officially about the security problem may be a bad idea. Typical teachers are as likely to say ""thanks"", as ""OMG hacker! security audit to make sure you didn't change any data will cost X$/h - your parents are paying for it and you're suspended"".",1235078012

He essentially states his own beliefs without giving reason for some of them or explaining why such mindsets are useful. (Or: he shows rather than tells.)<p>The phrase that stands out most upon first glance is this:<p><i>Similarly, to be a hacker you have to get a basic thrill from solving problems, sharpening your skills, and exercising your intelligence.</i><p><i>If you aren't the kind of person that feels this way naturally, you'll need to become one in order to make it as a hacker. Otherwise you'll find your hacking energy is sapped by distractions like sex, money, and social approval.</i><p>I've found this not to be the case. Wanting sex, money, and social approval is not necessarily detrimental. Similarly, I get no thrill from solving problems per se. I don't think that that thrill is a necessity for hackers.

Hopefully soon there will be generation of teachers that is as fast and as smart as the kids they are trying to teach.<p>To some extent I think it is the influence of our media rich world, and next to that probably the enormous amount of technology and information available to kids from a very young age onwards that causes kids to be so tremendously fast at the stuff that these teachers can barely cope with.<p>Boredom is their lot, unless you can get them interested, and once you manage that better hold on to your hat.<p>One thing I have found to be universal in dealing with 'gifted' or 'fast' children (I prefer those terms), it is that once you have gained their respect it gets a lot easier to communicate with them and to get them interested in the stuff that they should know.<p>It's just that if you're a teacher and you get these knowledge seeking missiles that can run rings around you your visceral response is probably to want them to slow down to your level. I think that is the best way to lose their respect.<p>Congratulations to your parents, they seem to have done just fine :)",1235077976

Nobody thinks Arjen Lenstra or Paul Kocher are doing work of a lesser caliber than Alan Cox; it is (I think obviously) harder to break RSA than it is to build a new Linux virtual filesystem layer. It is only because people like ESR don't know about people like Paul Kocher that this ""build vs. break"" meme spreads. Let's try to kill it when it appears.<p>What teenagers need to have is a sense of ethics. This has nothing to do with whether you spend your time finding holes in things, and everything to do with respecting property, with not assuming that you know the impact of every action you take that invades someone else's property, and hopefully with having a productive goal.<p>Here's what you need to tell your cousin: nobody in the real world gives a shit about your ability to break into one computer system. Per-host network penetration testing is close to the bottom rung of the computer security career ladder. If he likes breaking things, what he should do is start picking up open source software, researching how it works, finding vulnerabilities, and reporting them.<p>He's going to find really quickly that knowing you could --- if you were a criminal and a moron --- break into tens of thousands of computer systems is a lot more fun than breaking into one badly-configured school computer. He's also going to learn real computer science, because really breaking systems involves really reading and understanding code, runtimes, layering, information modeling and representation, and any of a zillion other things.<p>Computer security is a really awesome tour of a lot of the fun stuff in a CS curricula. I've worked on compilers, crypto math, distributed commit protocols, filesystems, and language runtimes in just the last 12 months. If he likes this stuff, get him to stay with it.<p>You asked for books. How about:<p>*   The Web Application Hacker's Handbook (bad title, great book).<p>*   Eldad Eilam's ""Reversing""<p>*   The Art Of Software Security Assessment (our industry's bible)<p>*   The Shellcoder's Handbook<p>*   The last 10 years of Black Hat Briefings talks, which are all available online.",1235077822

I know he meant it in a broader sense, but I see a lot of people (especially high school students and younger) wrongly interpreting that as ""don't go into CS; just go straight to a startup,"" especially with the specific mention of that plan of action.<p>I know that's a popular piece of advice given around here (though HN has an interesting mix of ""stuffy"" academia and ""Wild West"" hacker culture), and I felt the same way when I was younger. I thought I knew all the CS I needed to know to develop the stuff I'd want to develop. But I want to say that I am so overwhelmingly happy I have done CS at the college level. I knew so little back then (and still). It scares me that I almost neglected the path of inquiry that is /the/ single most interesting intellectual topic in my life.<p>So, young hackers out there, keep an open mind and a long-term view when you are following his advice to ""do whatever you want.""

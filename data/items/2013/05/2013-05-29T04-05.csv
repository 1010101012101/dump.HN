The combination of ""at-will"" and ""you lose everything if you're fired"" just reeks of danger, to be honest...<p>I've been dangling on the edge of leaving for some time now, the options were literally the only thing keeping me there -- the hope that if I stayed for 2-3 months longer, perhaps we'll get a surprise early exit. But it seems that given how much the valuation has changed now there's some more experienced people involved, even in the case of that early exit (which is very unlikely, I know), it isn't really going to do anything for me...<p>> Included from deleted post above, for the history books:<p>> Thanks for that. I've always been skeptical, and me (or any other employees) actually believed the company should be valued at $30m when it was. Another thing I found that was; my options aren't vested. They're exercisable immediately, but are restricted in the sense that the moment I leave the company (for any reason), I lose them. From what I've heard, it's much more common for a ~4 year vesting period, at which point they're essentially 'yours', whether you stay or not.

It's a bit funny in my particular case because I actually worked for University of Phoenix for a few years which is how I got the idea for HireArt.<p>I met a  ton of students at UOP who hadn't been as lucky as I had in going to a school like Yale (FYI, I was an athletic recruit so felt really grateful to be there). Employers literally ignored their resumes and would never get back to them. I was shocked because I would talk to some of these students and thought they were talented, ambitious, hard-working, etc. The thing that makes me passionate about HireArt is trying to overcome the obsession with credentials (which are very highly correlated with socio-economics) and moving toward a more meritocratic way of hiring.<p>Can I say that I am totally rid of the drive towards prestige? No. I fall into that trap. It's a hard trap not to fall into given how much society values brand names. Anyway, you pointed out a tension that I actually struggle with a lot.

If just asking wouldn't work, you could hint a relative is on their last legs and make a firmer request? A few months would probably clarify the issue in a way we can't for you.<p>Consider looking for a new job. Partly to judge the market, and the market's take on you, and partly to actually look for something much better. You could negotiate a six-month late start and have a vacation while you decided if the job really was for you.<p>Maybe you could already afford to retire - in Costa-Rica or Thailand for random example - and could buy and rent property there as a fallback nest egg in case this really was your retirement, but otherwise not costing so much as to hurt your savings assuming you'll want to try to retire here.<p>And lastly, what's the chance that retirement savings is going to be here when you want to retire? Are you paying attention to where it is enough to avoid the next bubble? Land would still be valuable to live on, rent, while currency-denominated assets could easily hyper-inflate. Some assets can be seized, or lost in war, others - or remotely stored ones - perhaps less.<p>All that said, <i>do it</i>!

And there are some very good reasons for it.  It helps keep the provenance and legality of the code in more of a known state, and could be important in a SCO v. IBM type case.  Also, if re-licensing ever becomes desirable down the road, it's a hell of a lot easier if at least one entity or person has permission to release the entire code base under an arbitrary license.  Take the Linux kernel, where it would be effectively impossible to relicense even if Linus wanted to, since the copyright ownership is spread out among gosh knows how many people, some of who nobody knows how to contact, and some of whom might not even be alive for all we know.<p>The FSF, ASF and other big open source organizations also typically require a CLA or a copyright assignment of some sort as well.

5784626,comment,5784074,5784531,8,0,chatmasta,,,"Have people considered that ""credentials and connections"" are actually a valuable signaling mechanism? Connections (in the broadest sense of the word) indicate that a candidate is able to form strong personal relationships. People are not robots, and this ability goes a long way in the workforce. If you are hiring someone, you know you're going to spend the majority of your waking time with that person for the foreseeable future. So any kind of signal that this will prove a positive use of your time is a valuable one. This is not to say that other schools don't offer this mechanism. I'm simply observing that the idea of ""connections"" does not carry nearly as much negative weight as its connotations often imply.<p>Similarly, credentials indicate that a candidate has conaistently passed more screening processes over a long duration of time than a company could practically present to the candidate. Consider that nobody is born into Yale (contrary to popular belief, and any exceptions to this are in the minority). To get to Yale, you effectively must pass through a fifteen year funnel. No company can match that kind of screening rigor, so why not leverage it? From a company's point of view, it would be dumb not to. (Also, think about it this way -- if you are a high school senior with a choice of any school, and therefore one of the smartest in your class, will you choose Yale or a state school? I parenthesized this because it's a straw man argument, but do consider that financial barriers to the Ivy League are basically non-existent nowadays.) Yes, you can get qualified candidates from other schools. But your chances of getting a ""lemon"" candidate from Yale are, I presume, much lower than getting one from another school. You know that at the very least the candidate is capable of learning quickly on the job. In many industries, especially those where most domain knowledge comes from real world experience, like finance and consulting, the ability to learn quickly is a candidates most valuable asset. If every candidate will arrive at the company with a ""blank slate""of knowledge and experience, why not recruit the ones who can fill up their slate the best? This is why finance companies recruit history majors, for instance. They know that success in a liberal arts education demonstrates an ability to learn quickly (not to mention strong writing skills).<p>I know many people on here are anti-liberal arts or anti-Ivy favoritism. Those arguments, especially the latter, have obvious validity. But I hope this post will cause you to consider the other side of the argument.<p>Disclaimer: I go to Yale. I realize we are extremely spoiled in the job market, but I also do not necessarily think it's undeserved. It's unfortunate that other people suffer, but I do not feel like we are disproportionately favored. I think a VERY high majority of Yale students are top 1% job candidates.

5784623,comment,5784074,5784377,7,0,jseliger,,,"<i>especially in fields dominated by overabundant cohorts like political science and english majors</i><p>Actually, according to Louis Menand's book <i>The Marketplace of Ideas: Reform and Resistance in American Universities</i>, the absolute number of English majors has declined over the last 40 or so years:<p><i>""Between 1945 and 1975, the number of American undergraduates increased 500 percent, but the number of graduate students increased by nearly 900 percent. On the one hand, a doctorate was harder to get; on the other, it became less valuable because the market began to be flooded with PhDs.<p>This fact registered after 1970, when the rapid expansion of American higher education abruptly slowed to a crawl, depositing on generational shores a huge tenured faculty and too many doctoral programs churning out PhDs. The year 1970 is also the point from which we can trace the decline in the proportion of students majoring in liberal arts fields, and, within the decline, a proportionally larger decline in undergraduates majoring in the humanities. In 197071, English departments awarded 64,342 bachelor's degrees; that represented 7.6 percent of all bachelor's degrees, including those awarded in non-liberal arts fields, such as business. The only liberal arts category that awarded more degrees than English was history and social science, a category that combines several disciplines. Thirty years later, in 200001, the number of bachelor's degrees awarded in all fields was 50 percent higher than in 197071, but the number of degrees in English was down both in absolute numbersfrom 64,342 to 51,419and as a percentage of all bachelor's degrees, from 7.6 percent to around 4 percent.</i><p>What field has taken its place? Business, which now accounts for about a quarter of all degrees awarded.<p>Moreover, according to the research done by Arum and Roska in <i>Academically Adrift</i>, undergrads in the hard sciences and humanities (including English) tend to show substantial increases in their reading comprehension skills, writing skills, and math skills over their first two years of college and over their college careers.",1369802488

5784519,comment,5783967,5784117,3,0,chc,,,"> <i>1. What does Rails do that Django doesn't?</i><p>The answer is, basically, ""Have a larger ecosystem without being Java."" There are a few things each has by default that the other doesn't, but by and large I don't think people pick Rails because it has 8 million features and Django only has 7.95 million.<p>> <i>2. Why hasn't the Python community seen whatever Ruby's doing and copied whatever makes Ruby popular? Are there any Python/Ruby experts reading this who are willing to port or reimplement the good parts of Ruby in Python?</i><p>Just about anything worthwhile already has an equivalent. The reason Ruby is popular is not really about features. Ruby is popular because Ruby managed to capture people's imagination. When the new generation of webdev was first coming around in the mid-2000s, Ruby had a huge burst of enthusiasm. Everybody was enamored with Ruby on Rails, and Ruby itself had lots of fanatical evangelists like Why who were eager to teach people. Python, ironically, was hampered by the fact that it was more mature and thus it was harder to get people excited about it. Additionally, Rails was the killer app for Ruby, while Python took a relatively long time to put out a comparable product. I don't remember if Django existed, but there certainly wasn't the situation you have today where Django is basically the ""Python Rails"" and they're seen as being on roughly equal footing. Instead, Pythonistas were all talking about how you should take Twisted and twelve other libraries and you just write all this glue code and then it's sort of like Rails if you squint really hard  and nobody really found that exciting either.<p>This isn't to say that Ruby doesn't have actual benefits to recommend it. Rails is a very nice, mature environment for web development, and Ruby as a whole has a very nice ecosystem these days. But the reason it got where it is is because Ruby won people over eight years ago, and it's gotten where it is today from that momentum. It isn't that Ruby is miles ahead and Python is simply inferior, but that Ruby just got a head start in that field and inertia matters a lot.<p>> <i>3. Are there any other reasons to prefer Ruby over Python besides Rails? For example, do Gems do things that are impossible with Pip?</i><p>The culture of the two languages is sort of different. Python invariably loves explicitness. Ruby isn't as crazy infatuated with ""magic"" as it used to be, but it's still much more acceptable over there to do weird tricks that let you write code the way you want to (e.g. ""this magically executes in a context with functions that aren't available elsewhere"") instead of the old-fashioned way. A lot of people prefer the latter, so they like Ruby. A lot of other people hate that kind of code, and they will be much happier using Python.",1369800042

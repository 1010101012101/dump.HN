All the other steps were pretty much identical.<p>Now personally I love manufacturing porn, I don't know why but I can watch an hour or two of 'How its Made' and just spin all these ideas about in my head. And what you see when you watch more than a bit of that show is that there are things that are designed to be built by automation, and things that aren't.<p>So on the one hand you look at things that aren't made to be automated and you think ""Hmm, can I disrupt that market by designing an automated way to build that widget?"" or as the OP wrote you might think ""Hmm what pieces need to be assembled to make an arbitrary widget?""<p>One of the things that came up in an earlier thread was that you could go across the street in Shenzen(sp?) and have an arbitrary fastener made. Things take lots of fasteners, and they are essential to manufacturing, but making them requires specific tooling for each kind. Can that be automated? Can I make a factory that will make an arbitrary fastener in small quantities (say 1,000) efficiently or cost effectively? You know steel rod in one side of various diameters and fasteners out the other. And then what would the API be to that factory? Select Head, diameter, material, length, quantity? Maybe finish?<p>One of the things that mixing sizes on the assembly line would have is keeping them separate, but have you seen how fast a pick-n-place robot can sort things? Could you just have a tray full of random fasteners come out of the anodizing tank and have a robot sort them into types?<p>Very interesting times coming up.",1347054976

This article (among a number of other ""oh noes Kickstarter will take all our monies"" scare-articles doing the rounds lately) misses a number of key points:<p>1.  It's a new product and a new team.  Delays are a normal part of any ambitious project and don't necessarily mean the product won't ship.<p>2.  For instance, consider that forecasted sales determine forecasted timelines<p>Their original shipping dates are based on raising a projected $100,000. At $99 for the cheapest Pebble, one can imagine that their worst case scenario was to ship roughly 1,000 Pebbles within their original timelines.  Their Kickstarter actually raised over $10.25 million and consequently they are supposed to ship 85x more Pebbles than that.  It's not hard to understand that such a dramatic difference in actuals vs. forecasts will result in a dramatic change in shipping time frames.<p>3.  More importantly, constant communication from the Pebble team shows they are making steady progress (current backers have until the end of the month to make their colour selections, and in the past month their team took advantage of their 70k backers to perform free market research into desired Pebble colours, which is a wise business decision);  I really don't see much to objectively worry about.<p>4.

Its even possible for unincorporated individuals to claim SR&ED on personal tax.<p>I would recommend though that you go to one of the public info sessions held in your area, since there are various angles to be aware of, that will help you optimize your claim.  For example:<p>- a small Canadian corp typically gets a better rate than a claim on personal tax;<p>- if you're a ""specified employee"" (meaning you own 10% or more of the corp) they place certain caps on things like how much of the ""proxy amount"" you can apply in your claim<p>- a lot of the claim revolves around how much of your expenses was for eligible work.  You typically have to be careful that a founder who is also doing marketing etc, is only claiming for the portion of time spent on the R&D part.<p>They go into all of this in the public info sessions, and they typically have specialists from various SR&ED areas available to answer pretty much any question.<p>You can also call them on various info lines, e.g. they offer a ""first-time claimant"" service where they try to make it easier for people looking at doing a first SR&ED claim, even coming out to visit your business if helpful.<p>They also offer a ""preclaim project review"" service where they'll give you a prelim opinion on the eligibility of a project, without you having to file a formal claim.  (While this is not  guarantee, it can for instance be used while raising funding, to demonstrate to prospective investors that you have a reasonable expectation of getting SR&ED support).<p>In fact there are a lot of public info sessions coming up in the near future:

believe you are too kind and well intentioned to notice the reality of
the situation. Then again, maybe I'm too harsh and jaded.<p>If you're as jaded as I am, you've already realized that the ancient
days when people put great stuff on the Internet because they enjoyed
working on it are long gone. The commercial interest of the web combined
with human vanity have transformed the Internet into a for-profit
popularity contest. The vast bulk of submissions to HN support this,
both the stuff on the front page, and all of the countless things that
have slid off of the 'newest' page into oblivion.<p>A large part of the supposed ""sentiments"" show in comments, submissions,
and voting/flagging are really just playing to the crowd. Though it
might be offensive to some, the typical phrase is ""karma whoring."" It's
really just human nature at work; if you buy or buy into some expensive
widget, you promote your choice publicly to gather the esteem of your
peers.  Similarly, if you abandon something, you disparage it publicly
to promote your choice and gather the esteem of your peers.<p>Using gmail/google?<p>Bought an Apple?<p>Programming in javascript?<p>Love/Hate copyrights?<p>All of the ""consensus"" issues boil down to pimping for profit and
praise, or resisting the resentments of others. A prime example is, when
was the last time you saw someone really speak out against javascript?
It does happen on occasion, but voicing a negative opinion of javascript
is always severely punished -- negative comments threatens the capacity
of js coders to make a living, so they respond harshly.<p>As noted by others, positive opinions of javascript are promoted
endlessly, and for the opposite reason -- positive comments increase
the value/income of js coders, so they respond beneficially.<p>There are plenty of people on HN that work for the big companies (Apple,
Google, Twitter, Facebook, Amazon, and gasp, Microsoft), so the pimping
and punishing is rampant on every mention of any of them. As harsh as it
might sound, the people employed by these companies have vested interest
in promoting and protecting them.<p>If someone disparaged the value of the skill you use to make a living,
how would you react?<p>On the flip side, if someone praised the value of the skill you use to
make a living, how would you react?<p>(For the record, I'm a typical human language monoglot, so I absolutely
envy your skill with the Chinese language!)<p><pre><code>  ...

Did my admission of envy for your skills make you feel good or proud of
your abilities?<p><pre><code>  ...

</code></pre>
Maybe that was just what I wanted you to feel...<p>If you have far too much free time and spend it watching the /newest
queue, you'll see the attempted manipulation of HN by both vested
parties and professional marketers. Their efforts are continuous, and
their goal is manufacturing ""consensus"" by any means possible. The
self-reinforcing echo chambers seen on HN and elsewhere are entirely
intentional, completely dubious in nature, and created specifically for
the sake of profit.<p>When you hear an echo, the only rational question is, ""Who profits from
this?""<p>With all of the above said, we still see people asking tough questions
and others responding in an honest attempt to contribute help. It's the
very best part of HN. Unfortunately, the bright sparks of HN have been
slowly fading in the face of contentious discussions, ever falling
average technical acumen, and of course, the self-centered motivations
behind promoting and punishing. I honestly don't know if the trend of
decline is inevitable or reversible, but surprisingly, I like to believe
the latter.",1347052150

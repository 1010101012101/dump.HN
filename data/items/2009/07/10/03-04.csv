697090,comment,697016,697042,0,0,patio11,,,"Right.  I love SQL, don't get me wrong, but there are a couple things my site does which SQL is just a suboptimal solution for:<p>1)  Action caching.  I stick it in memcached.  This gets me free expiry-by-time, free blow-away-cache-when-deploying-new-version, and saves me having to create and maintain a table specific to caching in the database.  (I really, really hate changing my schema, since I invariably manage to screw something up when migrating.  Solution: don't, absent a clear need to.)<p>2.  Caching expensive queries.  Again, memcached.  Much of my analytics data is publicly accessible, changes infrequently (how often am I going to add a new sale to March 2007, honestly?), and lets users calculate very expensive summary statistics.  This screams ""cache me!"" rather than letting somebody burn my server to the ground just by opening up /stats and clicking like mad.<p>3.  Short-term scratchpad.  I have a couple of places where I need to remember little bits of information for a few minutes.<p>For example, a lot of customers have issues with entering registration keys, so I try to make this automatic for as many as possible.  One way to do this is to have the application generate a random ID for itself, and submit this random ID to my web page when requesting the sales page.  The sales page then passes this to my offsite payment processor, who will in turn pass it back with successful transactions.  Meanwhile, the application polls the server periodically to see whether their ID has been associated with a purchase recently.  Sure, I could stick that in the Customer table, but it feels unclean: logically, it isn't a business requirement of customers, it is just a little hack I use to make their lives easier, and it has no meaning outside of an interval which lasts, on average, about 30 seconds.",1247198172

697081,comment,697016,697016,0,0,pj,,,"These heroku guys are selling something. They're on a bandwagon, constantly bashing SQL databases.  I'd say SQL Databases are great for 90% of information based systems.<p>The problem you are going to run into, I know a company they wanted a particular database, so they got a designer turned programmer who built a system for them in Perl using flat files.  His architecture was to put one data field per line in a file and then put the one-to-many records, comments about the master record in the file starting at line x. Well, now they have fields for the master item all the way to line x minus 2 and they know they want like 5 more fields.<p>If the developer who built the system had started on an SQL database, then the solution to the problem of needing more fields would be really simple.<p>Now this problem is just one issue.  Add to this the problem of needing to query the master records on particular fields.  The programmer has to open up every single file and go to the particular line where the field exists and see what the value is.  Of course as the file based database grows, it's really starting to impact performance.<p>The big problem here is that the original programmer didn't know SQL or how to manage a SQL database so he downloaded some Perl code (note, I absolutely LOVE perl, so don't be hating) that managed a dataset in perl and just went to town.<p>This is not the way to build a robust information based system.<p>SQL databases are a tool and files are a tool and CouchDB is a tool and a lot of people are going to read this biased stuff about noSQL and think, ""hey, let's use couchdb, et al"" and they only have 5 users on the system and, you know, maybe a million records and Access, MySQL, SQL Server Express, or any number of other free sql based systems would handle a problem like that just fine.<p>Instead, they're going to go write a ton of code to fit a key/value store to the problem and it's going to be a nightmare to support as the system grows and they need to implement security and manage more fields.<p>But the pro-noSQL people don't talk about <i>all</i> those issues that are going to arise later and focus <i>solely</i> on the scalability issue when in the vast majority of cases scalability is really the last thing you need to think about.",1247197780

And while I acted mostly just stupid while I was high I wouldn't want to miss the experience. I learned a lot how much my thoughts are shaped by the way I see the world. Some of it could be simulated without drugs - like playing with the visual or hearing  stimuli by some technology. For example watching everything through a camera which has some strange image-filters for a few minutes might give you an idea of some of the effects. But the image-filters would have to be pretty advanced sometimes, like for example a filter which makes the whole world look like painted from Rembrandt. But other parts - I just don't know any other way to experience them. Like mind-states which are so different from normal thinking that you can't even recall them until you get high the next time.<p>I can't really tell you about concrete benefits and I think even LSD has its dangers. But it is a whole different experience from alcohol. _If_ you ever try it then make sure to read up on it first. Like Timothy Leary said: ""The nature of the experience depends almost entirely on set and setting."" So your expectations (the set) will influence the trip and being more informed will make you feel better so the trip will be better.",1247197452

If that were so denormalization wouldn't be a standard technique to speed up queries that join many tables and have to be really fast.  The fact is SQL databases force you to reconstruct your document from many tables in a query and that is costly, even with indexes.<p>It's simply much faster to not break the data up in the first place to fit it into a tables and rows data structure if speed is your primary concern.  Storing a complex document, as is, will result in much faster retrieval.<p>RDBM's are a tool, a damn fine tool, but like any tool, they're aren't the answer to every solution and far too many people pull out the RDBMS as the answer to every problem.",1247197210

697066,comment,697016,697016,0,0,mdasen,,,"Relational database alternatives aren't as applicable as they make them sound.  They've provided some examples.  The first one is a social networking profile with a list of interests.  ""Awesome!  I can just store things in a JSON-like list and not have another table or anything!""  Oh, what if I want to find all the users who have 'ruby' as an interest?  Oh, I can only lookup by key?  And yes, there are ways around that.  You could create a table of interests and each interest would be a key in that table and it would have a list of people with that interest.  So, you have 'Joe' => 'interests': 'ruby', 'blokus'; 'Amanda' => 'interests': 'ruby', 'rugby'.  And then you have an interests table with 'ruby': ['Joe', 'Amanda'].  And when you want to search by interest, you select the document from the interests table and get the list of people and then request the documents for those people.  But is that more efficient?  No.  It both requires more code and takes longer to execute.  A RDBMS is able to optimize a join on that data in a way that you can't.<p>Similarly, with the e-commerce orders: what if you want to retrieve by the product ordered?  It's not unreasonable to assume a situation where certain products are fulfilled by warehouse A and others by warehouse B.  Well, you're in the same boat again doing a less efficient thing.<p>Plus, what is hard to scale when it comes to a database?  The article is passing off SELECT statements as hard to scale.  Now, I'm not saying that they're a piece of cake.  You can get into a lot of trouble.  However, reads are relatively easy to scale since you can just add more boxes.  Writes are hard to scale because, unless you shard and do other hard things, you only get the power of one box for writes (since the writes have to be done on every box while a read only has to occur on one box).<p>So, even if you're using a document based store, you eventually have to shard.  Now, when you never relate data, sharding can be a lot easier since it can be done based on a hash function.  Systems like memcached do this automatically.  So when you say get(1, 42, 64, 128) it will be able to hash those ids and send each request to the proper server for that item.  But that means that you lose out on a lot of ease.  And most of these alternative stores don't do that for you (and it's why memcached is such a useful tool alongside a RDBMS).<p>And SQL databases do scale a lot more than Heroku (in these two articles) seems to let on.  Wikipedia, Facebook, Craigslist, and Flickr are all backed by MySQL.  Now, not MySQL alone.  Memcached is a big part of it for all/most of them (I don't remember what each site uses exactly).  There's a reason why many of the largest sites use a SQL database and it's not because they're unaware of other storage engines.<p>It seems like Heroku might be getting a lot of complaints that the service isn't magically scaling.  Computers aren't magic and document based databases aren't any more magic.  CouchDB uses B-Tree indexes just like relational databases.  The difference isn't so much that these data stores offer better performance for some lookups.  It's more that they only offer the lookups that can have good performance.<p>I feel like I should offer some free advice to Heroku: your SQL databases would scale better if your dedicated SQL boxes were Amazon's high-RAM boxes rather than the high-CPU ones they opted for.  RAM means more for database performance than CPU.  Oh, also, offer some consulting for clients on their database woes.  A lot of the time, people are doing lookups that should be using an index, but they haven't created it and so the database has to do a full table scan rather than an index lookup.  And there's a big difference there.  A full table scan of 1 million records will take 50,000 times longer than an index scan.  Yeah, indexes are good.  One of the reasons that CouchDB ""scales so well"" is that you can <i>only</i> do queries on things you've made indexes for.<p>I'm not saying that non RDBMS don't have their place.  They do.  However, we keep seeing articles posted about RDBMS not scaling and it doesn't seem like they quite know the purpose of scale.  Scale doesn't have to be infinite.  Nothing will do that.  The questions is: will it scale enough to handle the traffic?  And SQL databases will unless you're really, really big.  Do you expect your site to become a top 500 site on the internet?  Heck, WordPress.com at #20 is doing fine implementing a not very efficient SQL backed blog.  Now, I'm sure they implement caching and such, but it's still SQL backed.<p>Basically: learn a lot about indexes.  If you become one of the top sites on the internet, hire someone who can help you. In the meantime make your product and don't worry too much about the FUD.",1247197032

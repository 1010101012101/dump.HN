Not just cut 'n' paste: cool mashup features like synchronization and single-point identity management (so you don't have to tell Facebook and Twitter what you're doing, you can just enter it in one place) ...""</i><p>I've been doing something similiar to this. Here's what I'm finding working with lots of different 3rd party sites ... <p>Using API's<p>- not every site has an API or RSS so you have to CUT+PASTE :(<p>- even sites with API's have poor documentation (code, txt) so it can be difficult to use<p>- posting data (say to twitter,flickr ) is way easier than extracting via an API/RSS<p>- no company(ies) want(s) their hard-won user data to be used commercially (check the legal agreements) so while you can integrate each site requires permission - yuk!<p>- solve the password & authorisation problem for each 3rd party site  <p>Integration layer<p>- abstract an API to talk to each service (eg: as Perl does to databases in the DBI module)<p>- support the most popular sites that people use first (flickr, twitter, Facebook, MySpace etc)<p>- constrain the features you want to support for each 3rd party site (eg: notifications by friends in twitter, or flickr. New books suggested in <a href=""http://www.librarything.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.librarything.com</a>) <p>- keep up with changes made to each service, handle bugs, quirky code<p>Extraction layer<p>- synchronise 3rd party added data and client side added data (the ""add in 1 place"" bit mentioned). This means being able to either/or add data at the client or get the data the user added at the 3rd party site as well and somehow sychronise them<p>- you need tools to extract, manipulate  RSS/ATOM feeds. A boon because you don't need API's<p>Messaging layer<p>- using your abstracted API be able to message various different services
 and here's the hard bit depending on the service. Do you want to send everyone on Twitter a photo update if you have entered 20 flickr photos? <p>- you need to capture store, query, link check and update the various links, metadata and information that message generates. <p>
Presentation layer<p>- layering of data. Intelligent hierarchies of data that be queried by other <p>- flexible presentation layers that can export variety of data formats web pages as to XML, RSS files, mobile phone SMS, etc.<p>- flexible presentation layer(s) that can support different levels of information from a complete archive of past posts to their titles or individual tags<p>- metadata ... support things like tags, microformats at a per document level and be flexible enough to allow for more formats that arise. <p>Of course on top of this you have to build something that others will use, that is bug free as possible in Javascript. Something on or along the lines of Yahoo's YUI ~ <a href=""http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/</a>  Maybe this YUI or NewSDK is what Steve Yegge meant when he was talking about the <i>""Next big language""</i> ? ~ <a href=""http://steve-yegge.blogspot.com/2007/02/next-big-language.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://steve-yegge.blogspot.com/2007/02/next-big-language.ht...</a><p>In all this I can't help think that maybe just solving a few little problems might be a better starting point and if you do so make sure it's the <i>open web</i> and not some roach motel that sucks up data instead of allowing data to flow.<p>",1190176711

56704,comment,56618,56618,0,0,Xichekolas,,,"Favorite computer book: Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs - ISBN 0-07-000484-6 - Whether you actually like Scheme is beside the point. I got this book for an intro class into functional programming, and we only used sections one and two... but I enjoyed it so much I went through the rest of it on my own during Christmas break. Was probably the greatest experience I have had programming since first groking OO.<p>Favorite non-computer book: Ender's Game - ISBN 0-812-55070-6 - I have probably read this about 10 times. All the other books in the series are good too, but it really stands apart from the rest.<p>As an aside, the Economist is probably the best (IMHO) news source out there, as it actually goes in depth as to the causes of events, rather than just listing them with pretty explosions. It's also delightfully devoid of sensationalist stories normally found on TV News or Newspapers. Added bonus: you get a nice discount if you subscribe as a student. Not sure I could recommend it highly enough.",1190175910

Not just with respect to how societies function, but basic concepts like incentives and the law of supply and demand. Oh, and of course No Free Lunch. <p>So in that spirit, here are a couple of economics books that I quite seriously believe everyone should be forced to read.<p>Economics in One Lesson, by Hazlitt <p>Free to Choose: A Personal Statement, by Milton and Rose Friedman<p>Freakonomics, by Levitt and Dubner (this book is just so damn fun to read)<p>
and for the hackers:
The God of the Machine, by Paterson
(Think engineering principles as applied to economics, history and politics. Probably one of the most interesting books I've read in my entire life, even if I don't entirely agree with the thesis.)

Flickr never nad problems with users paying for their services. <p>Finally, del.icio.us does not even belong to a group of companies this thread is all about (over-hyped startups with venture millions, producing crap) - it was a personal part-time pet project of a guy who didn't live in the Valley, didn't ask for millions for coding it.

Or both (Google). <p>Overwhelming number of Web 2.0 startups are neither.

56696,comment,56626,56668,0,0,palish,,,"It would simply take a browser plugin for every type of browser. NewSDK code would be inside HTML comments, just like conditional comments are. The browser plugin would parse this  code and cache it (aka compile it). From there, it would be trivial to implement image copy and paste.<p>Keep in mind that I have no idea what the limitations of a browser plugin are, but if one can:<p>1) parse the raw source code that's sent down from the server, including comments<p>2) manipulate the DOM<p>3) open an outgoing connection<p>Then you could do, well, anything. Embed Ruby into pages, for example. The reason you can do that is because the Ruby interpreter doesn't have to be a part of your browser plugin. All you have to do is convince users to download your C++ app that DOES contain a Ruby interpreter and runs in the background, then your plugin communicates with that via a socket. Your app then issues commands back to your plugin (you can think of those commands as assembly instructions) which manipulate the DOM or whatever else a plugin can do.",1190175149

56691,comment,56626,56626,0,0,bokonist,,,"A couple of problems with his argument:<p>1)  Web entrepreneurs working now still need to optimize for speed.  It's not like the desktop world where you are launching a year or two from now and can wait for the computers to catch up.  You are launching a month from now and it needs to be fast.  I would prefer to use a web mail client other than GMail, simply because I'm scared of my Google dependency.  But every other web email client I've used ( Yahoo, Joyent, inbox.com, Zimbra) feels much slower.  Google spends enormous effort optimizing their javascript load times and it really pays off.<p>2)  Broadband speeds are not growing at Moore's law.  Terrible regulatory law trumps technological gains.<p>3)  It be hard for a company to lock everyone into its  javascript platform when the entire source code is downloadable.<p>4)  The trouble with javascript is not cross browser incompatibility.  If you use a good library and have learned common gotchas you should not have to spend too much time debugging IE ( I probably spend less than 10% of my javascript coding time on cross browser issues).  The trouble with javascript is that there are still a number of things it just can't do, and won't be able to do until the browsers change.  For instance, there is no way to detect the exact pixel size of a character of text.  This makes it impossible to build a real word processor in javascript.  Nor can you detect a collision between the opaque regions of two png images (this is needed for most simple 2-d games).  Well ... it's almost impossible to do these things.  I suppose you could define your own image and font formats completely in javascript, and render the entire screen using 1 pixel divs.  But that's just crazy talk.  It would be a huge library - maybe 250 MB - and would be very slow until computers got faster.  And it would require eating at least 6000 packages of ramen to build the thing.  Hmmmmm .... maybe I have an idea I can apply to YCombinator with ... :-)",1190174531

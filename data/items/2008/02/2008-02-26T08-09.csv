I've wished I could have foreseen bad events, but not wished I'd tried less hard. I like trying hard... it's fun; I don't just do it for money. Other people can take away the rewards that I may have been entitled to, but they can't tell me that my efforts were mediocre.",1204016354

123763,comment,123265,123265,0,0,rontr,,,"If Symbol#to_proc is so great, I'd like to see how it can elegantly express something that can't be hidden behind a simple library function. In any decent language the programmer would write ""sum(1,100)"". Even if the function's implementation in Python/Java/C++/Smalltalk/Lisp/etc required a few more characters, it wouldn't be a meaningful difference. Does Symbol#to_proc add any <i>real</i> power to Ruby or beyond enabling such linguistic brain teasers?",1204015252

For example, Monday to Wednesday for one company the freelance work from Thursday to Saturday. This arrangement works well for all concerned. The company gets an expert who learns the business at a pro-rata rate.

Customer submits the idea that is something like this ""I want a web application like twitter and youtube combined.""  They submit $500, you create a spec and mock up.  They accept and they pay you some sort of up-front fee.  Then deviations from the spec are factored in at $x per hour.<p>I know someone who has an ""Indian programming team"" and he has to tell them in great detail what to do.  They have to have every step a-b-c they cannot make a leap from a-c figuring out b on there own. Great detail has to spent on instructions for anything no matter how small.<p>This makes everything like torture and in order to be able to use them he has about 10 projects going at once so even when they can't work on one project there is something else to do.<p>The projects also re-utilize many of the same details from the last project.  Even so, all of those same details have to be given even though they have done more then 10 projects with the same instructions for example, the flash uses inputs from the query string, every time, each project uses the same inputs.  They have to be told each time to not hardcode links into the flash, they have to be told again what querystring items to take and how to use them, this is one example.  This programmers are dedicated, they are not supposed to be working on projects for any other company, so they should be able to figure out ""hey this is just like that last one"" but they can't<p>The point is, if you can create a service which can do the logical leaps from a-c like an in-house programmer can do then you would have a good service.<p>As for a market, there have been many people on news.yc (non-hackers) that ask about having an offshore development team do the work on there ""amazing"" idea.  I believe this desire is widespread but the problem is how to get something you don't have 100 pages of nitty gritty detail documentation on developed.  I would suggest specializing in ""alpha"" implementations of ideas for non-hackers that want to test there ideas and have some money to burn.",1204015120

Keyboard events should change only the ""action state"" of your game objects and entities, e.g. when you press a key to move left, the player should be in the ""moving left"" state, but the actual movement should not be handled there.<p>Parallel to the input (okay you will need a separate thread of keyboard listening and for game logic) you will loop over your entities and update their state, processing things such as movement.",1204014293

I want to control my TV with my iPad.  Apple has to be concerned about Google's somewhat strong (albeit supposedly buggy) foray into the living room.  How can they give away this territory without putting up a better fight?  I predict that the killer feature will be optional control via an iPhone/iPad.  The 10' interface stinks for content selection and other input-intensive activities although it's great for a shared viewing experience.  The new ATV should turn my A/V set-up into a seemingly dumb slave of my iPad.  Some IR repeaters to do Harmony-esque things would be a huge bonus.  I also predict that this device will be Google TV-like in that it acts as a pass-thru for other, ""legacy"" devices.  The interesting question will be whether it will include a Blu-Ray player.  Of course, I have no special knowledge of Apple's plans -- I'm just looking at all the other cards Apple has played and imagining a product which makes the previously played cards look like brilliant moves.",1305586064

Build a landing page, offer something for free (eg. a free report) to your visitors and get them to opt into your mailing list. Then upsell, upsell and upsell. It's harder than it seems and is a full time job. A simple website with a nice landing page and an opt-in form will do just fine, but getting traffic to it is another matter altogether. You would need to do SEO, Affiliate Marketing (eg. through ClickBank), AdWords, Article Marketing, Press Releases, Guest blogging, YouTube videos etc. to get decent traffic and build up the mailing list. The list then becomes your potential customer database and then you have follow the usual sales process to get them to buy your product.<p>There are some very good training courses out there on information marketing too.

If there's <i>real</i> potential to make more than $100k in a year then it's probably something an experienced salesperson will look at. Some residual revenue is always appreciated by not necessary in reality. It depends on how much work the things I listed above will be.<p>If you were to ask me to sell your product I'd want to know these things:<p><pre><code>  1) Who are your customers? (I want to know if you know who they are or if it's my job to figure it out)\n  2) What's the competitive advantage of your product? (Basically, what pain point did you choose to solve and why is it different from everything else)\n  3) What have the objections been from the customers you've talked to? (What are the deficiencies in your product and strategy? How long is it going to take me to overcome those.)\n  4) Who are your competitors? (I need to know who I'm in the race with. Lame ducks or marathon runners?)\n</code></pre>\nWith answers to those three questions it would be easy enough to figure out if it's worth continuing.  B2B sales cycles are typically longer so an experienced rep would probably flesh it out pretty fully before committing.  6mo-1year sales cycles are not uncommon. Knowing that it could take that long to make any money they'll probably want to know that there's potential for high earnings and a very large potential market (Can easily fill a funnel of prospects worth more than $1MM).<p>In my experience it's best to find someone that knows your market really, really well and make it worth their while. There's no specific formula for % commissions (My splits have been all over the map), just make it reasonable for both of you.",1305585248

Further the engineering design target (one assumes they test to that target) is that if you integrate over all the heat you generate from all the byproducts from a reactor that was running at 'full' and now has all of its control rods inserted, is less than the heat you would need to add to melt the containment vessel (the flask) You won't be able to restart it but you won't have the core melt through the vessel either.""<p>Which seems to have been the case. (comments about holes in the vessel that are plugged by graphite and can leak small amounts of fuel out the bottom of the reactor came later, but the original design continues to keep nearly all the fuel in the reactor's flask.)<p>And perhaps my most polyannaish post in this comment: <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2324328"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2324328</a><p>""And as others have pointed out, if you get a ""full meltdown"" with the control rods fully inserted, the resulting uranium/boron alloy is not critical.<p>In short hand, once the rods are in, its game over, just a question of how hard the final result is to clean up.<p>If you keep it under the melting point of the core you can just pull the fuel and dispose of it in the normal way, if not you have to clean out the non-critical slag core.""<p>Seems to be where we'll end up. removing the remains of the fuel rods from the bottom of the reactor where they ended up after the fuel pins lost their integrity.<p>I'll reiterate, bad accident, not a 'huge disaster.'<p>Could it get worse? I can imagine scenarios where it could. The waste fuel pond structure could crack and all the water could drain out of those ponds, that would lead to a lot of gamma rays for anyone line of sight to the rods and a possible criticality event if enough neutrons were generated. Will it get worse? At this point it seems the events that would be required are improbable at best.

Math provides the building blocks used to produce creative (and sometimes very innovative) solutions to problems in the form of software. Material properties and laws of physics similarly provide the building blocks used to produce creative solutions to problems in the form of physical devices or mechanisms.<p>Just because the basic building blocks used to formulate an innovation aren't patentable, it doesn't necessarily follow that the innovation itself shouldn't be patentable if it's truly innovative and worth protecting (which most software patents certainly aren't, but some undoubtedly are).",1305584167

Also don't underestimate the willingness of people to _want_ to research. And lets not forget that companies in Europe do not have software patents (yeah, some gray area still exists...) and still do research, so we already know the software world won't break down without software patents.<p>And while your arguments are still valid to a certain extend - it has to be evaluated against the costs of the patent system and the benefits you'll get from erasing the patent system. For example right now every startup-up is in danger of running into patent troubles unless they start pair-coding with a lawyer. People avoid looking at patents because they are scared of treble damages and people avoid coding optimal solutions trying to work around patents. Companies can block each other and managers and investors are in a constant state of risk that their coders will violate patents (mostly without even knowing it). Patents are no longer used to boost innovation, but they are used primarly as a weapon.",1305583859

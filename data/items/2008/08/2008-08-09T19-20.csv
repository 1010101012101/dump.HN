I can't tell the driver behind me ""I'm going to be slowing down in 10 seconds, get ready.""  Likewise, it isn't easy to convey to someone merging onto a freeway that I'm going to let them in ahead of me so we both end up slowing down so that we're both still in contention with each other until someone takes the initiative.<p>Now, if only we had some way that cars could communicate with each other and the road so that they could regulate speed and allow operations such as merging as efficiently as possible. . .",1218311992

There is a huge difference between manipulating someone and negotiating to get what you want. The first implies control, generally without their consent. The latter is all about understanding their needs (which are often emotional and may require asking probing questions, reading body language, making that person comfortable etc) and finding out how you can come to a consensus that satisfies both parties.<p>The problem I was alluding to is that technical people seem to think that using anything other than cold, hard facts to come to terms is ""manipulative.""

Why did they pull Netshare from the app store?<p>""I expect Google's android to do the same.""<p>First, what can Android do that Windows Mobile and Symbian haven't already been doing for years? Android is just Google's attempt to get its advertisements displayed more often on mobile devices. It is the same thing that every advertising company has been trying to do in Japan, the US, and everywhere else ever since it's been possible to advertise on phones.<p>Authorized retailers for AT&T/Verizon/etc. cannot sell any devices that aren't approved by the respective carrier. If the carrier doesn't approve the Android devices then they can only be sold at stores that don't sell service contracts. Those independent stores are not successful in the US, because everybody wants a phone tied to a service contract so that the cost of the phone is subsidized. If the carriers don't subsidize Android phones they will be priced out of the market.<p>Further, any carrier can block any device. IMEI numbers are allocated in blocks and it isn't hard to identify the model based on the IMEI number. Without regulation (""net neutrality"") they can also block any application or any protocol from operating on their network.",1218309336
271884,comment,271202,271806,0,0,un,,,"I'm trying to draw a parallel between how content on the web is being created and how an artificial mind might be created.  If you sat down at tried to engineer a giant encyclopedia within one company/community, you would end up with britannica (within one company), and wikipedia (within a community of enthusiasts), However, the web at large is much larger than both of these because of the economic incentives for people to create articles. Many people try and fail (in effect working for free), but the progress is rapid, as in evolution.
In the same way, incentivizing people to produce classifiers would have the similar effect of rapid progress.<p>If you think of intelligence as being the ability to predict accurately, having a giant web of classifiers that predict accurately could be construed as a form of artificial general intelligence, or a human type artificial intelligence. Having an enough data about the world, because you have created many classifiers that can recognize the semantic events in video and speech, would allow you to make all the same types of recognitions and predictions that a human would make.",1218309332

I thought Whole Foods was an ""empowered"" workplace where employees made the decisions about what happens on the floor.  This seems like something they ought to have a say about, if they are, in fact, able to make decisions about how the store where they work operates.  I'd certainly never be happy about charging someone $0.50 for ice to go with a beverage they were already paying for...every independent coffee shop I've ever been to will serve just about anything over ice if you ask (and in Austin, on hot days, I found they often asked preemptively if I wanted it iced).",1218309235

The quoted ""stock answer"" for how bloggers want to be approached is there for a reason -- people don't want to get bombarded with semi-spam about stuff they don't care about -- particularly if the sender is expecting the recipient to be a patsy to spam their readership with buzz about something they don't care about.<p><i>Newsflash: The internet is big.

But it's a pretty predictable discount: Buy a lot, get it cheaper.  We also, behind the scenes, gave all of our early adopter beta customers a free year on their licenses.  Everybody.  But we didn't talk about it a lot, because we knew that wasn't the way it was always going to be...and didn't want people thinking we just suddenly started charging <i>more</i> and giving <i>less</i>.  T-shirts are also something that we give away a lot...but we give them to pretty much <i>anyone</i> who asks for one (when we have them).  We don't even care if they're a paying customer.  If they like what we do enough to want to wear a T-shirt with our logo on it, we want them to have one.<p>So, I dunno.  Nickel and dime-ing has always seemed a little short-sighted to me.  I'm maybe more of a cheapskate than most folks, but it still seems problematic.  To put it in perspective, when I stay at a mid-range hotel, I'm delighted when I find that a pretty good breakfast and parking is provided for free...when I stay at a high end resort, I'm pretty seriously disappointed to find that a maybe slightly better breakfast costs $45 and parking is only available via valet and costs $25/day, plus tips.  If I pay $150/night and breakfast/parking is included...why if I pay $400/night, do I still have to pay exorbitant prices for the other stuff?  See, I'm cheap!  But I'm not complaining about things costing more...just that it feels like the mid-range hotel is providing more service for less, while the high-end hotel is looking to extract money from me every time I turn around.

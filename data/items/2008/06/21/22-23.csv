This is an accurate depiction of what science is like today.<p><i>Science</i> and <i>Nature</i> are filled with articles about medicine and biology and chemistry and physics and so on. These are what scientists think of as science. Rarely does a math or computer science paper slip in, except in the case of groundbreaking new work. And yet most CS professors would give anything to have a paper of theirs published in <i>Science</i>. So you can see how the rest of science values our contributions: every once in a while we contribute something interesting, but for the most part we are not noteworthy. And this is the way it should be. Bipartite graph algorithms and topological manifolds are not as important as Gardasil and alternative energy.<p>A substantial number of doctors doing useful research these days are, surprise, Medical Doctors. If you want an eye opening experience, take a trip over to the nearest medical library and spend some time going through the journals. It will radically change your opinion of what science is and how your field fits into it. <i>Discrete Math</i> is a pretty cool journal, but it's kind of embarrassing to hold it up to <i>The New England Journal of Medicine</i>. Even <i>Annals of Math</i> is, well, pretty irrelevant.<p>There's a long tradition of specialists taking myopic views of the world. Computer Scientists think the world is one big computer (<a href=""http://focus.aps.org/story/v9/st27"" rel=""nofollow"">http://focus.aps.org/story/v9/st27</a>), chemists think life is one big chemical reaction, stone-cutters think everything can be explained in terms of stone-cutting (<i>The Stone Diaries</i>). Rarely is that the whole truth. You have to be careful to step back and take your own bias into account.",1214089070

That you can expect another programmer to have solved the same problem almost the same way..? I figure this is how that happens.",1214089031

I put up an ad on craigslist asking for someone to pair-program with me.  We've been pairing 4-5 days a week.<p>We expect to go live next week.<p>I'm scheduled to start a Ph.D. in another six weeks.  I could delay.  It's a tough choice.  Getting my first toe in the entrepreneurial water has been exciting and fulfilling.  I'm getting to do things ""the way I always wanted to"".",1214087508

Only after validating the email address are members able to post, vote, etc.<p>One advantage to this is that I'm able to keep track of who hasn't validated their email and therefore become full-fledged members of whatever site they joined. I can start a conversation with them and learn from them what I overlooked about the site -- or point things out to them that they may have missed.",1214086868

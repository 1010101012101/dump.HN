What sent me over the edge with Experts Exchange is the fact that to sign up for a free trial, you had to enter in credit card information. That kept me away from the site for a long time, until one day when I was desperate for an answer and it appeared that EE might have one. I bit the bullet and quickly signed up, not reading over the fine print. Next month, lo and behold, I see a charge on my credit card for a full membership rate at EE.<p>Shame on me for not assuming this would happen when I signed up, but shame on EE for implementing this scammy business practice in the first place.

It&#x27;s like reading science fiction, one shouldn&#x27;t confuse it with reality, at least not without evidence to justify that.<p>> <i>It&#x27;s the idea that every mathematical structure just &#x27;exists&#x27;, like &#x27;poof magic&#x27;, and the simpler ones would, like, have greater weight.</i><p>There&#x27;s no evidence that this is how reality works, and there&#x27;s no particular reason to think that it should work this way.<p>> <i>A corollary is, the simpler the laws of physics are, the more probable the above hypothesis is. And suddenly we learn that the true laws of physics might be much simpler than we anticipated? This is huge.  Or not.</i><p>All current evidence is that it&#x27;s a fantasy, one which happens to be so attractive to some people that they&#x27;re willing to suspend critical thinking to favor it, much as people do with belief in supernatural beings.<p>There are certainly cases where basic mathematical principles are expressed in a very direct way in the universe.  Probability in quantum mechanics is one example, Noether&#x27;s Theorem is another.  But even in these cases, saying that some property of the universe arises from pure mathematics is misleading.<p>To boil down the objection, mathematics is a way to describe and model these phenomena, and shouldn&#x27;t be confused with the phenomena themselves.  Doing so is a map/territory style confusion.<p>If you want to say that the universe arises from pure mathematics, you then have to explain what sort of phenomenon pure mathematics <i>is</i>, that it is capable of producing such effects.  To use my analogy, it would be a bit like saying &quot;The topography of Earth arises from a pure map.&quot;<p>> <i>The idea of a timeless universe, where our subjective notion of time just arise from its structure has been around for quite some time.</i><p>That&#x27;s a little different from the idea that reality is an incarnation of pure mathematics.  In case, the fact that ideas have been around for some time has little bearing on their validity.  Consider astrology.<p>> <i>Likewise, Occam&#x27;s Razor itself suggests that the true laws of physics are simpler than we think.</i><p>It does not actually suggest that in general.  It can mean that in cases where an explanation contains unnecessary elements, but it says nothing about explanations necessarily being simple, or simpler than they already are.<p>> <i>Plus, current human laws of physics are either false or incomplete.</i><p>I prefer to think in terms of models than laws, and models are always incomplete.  The only complete model is the thing being modeled itself.<p>> <i>I fully expect future physics to be further simplified. Claims of massive simplification are therefore not that surprising.</i><p>By your premise, <i>actual</i> simplification would not be surprising, but claims have no necessary correlation to actual simplifications.<p>Sorry to be picky!",1379525129

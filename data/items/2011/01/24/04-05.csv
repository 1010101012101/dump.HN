Steve Jobs may well recover from his illness, I certainly hope he does, but nevertheless like the rest of us he is not immortal. At some point in the future, and maybe it's even happening now but we don't realize it yet, another innovative genius will come along and change the world. Maybe not at Apple, but somewhere. This is pretty much a guarantee.",1295845104
2134296,comment,2132587,2133125,0,0,camz,,,"I'd like to clarify this argument.  This is often a cited ""alternative""  A national sales tax won't be a simplified cure.  Current sales tax laws issued by the states are considered fairly simple.  Whatever you buy is taxed at X rate.  But, from years of experience in sales tax, it is one of the most complicated areas of taxation that is constantly changing.<p>Ex: Have you ever wondered why supermarkets are designed the way they are?  Tax is the reason why every major supermarket redesigned their layout years ago.  There is a landmark case that argues whether a snickers bar is considered food or candy.  Two categories with different tax rates.  In the end the judge stated that candy is anything sold at the register counter and food is anything held within the isles.'<p>Simplification is an ideal that never pans out because we're always going to look for the loophole and its our own ingenuity that made the current IRC so complicated.  Everything starts out simple until life gets a hold of it.",1295845092

Only C corporations or regular corporations are allowed to retain earnings.  Pass-through entities such as partnerships and S-corporations are required to pass any income to the owners regardless of whether cash or any other form of income is distributed.<p>If you want to reinvest into the company, then you'd have to pay taxes on the distributed income and then put the after tax money back into the business, which would increase your tax basis in the company.  This would allow you to take net operating losses in the future as well as help you if you ever sell the company.<p>Hope that helps.

2134271,comment,2134259,2134259,0,0,signa11,,," this is my favorite take away from the whole thing:<p>That need to rewrite is important and often neglected when coding. Modern programming languages, especially object-oriented ones, are interface heavy. This means that before you can make anything happen you need to write down a lot of preliminaries, often making important API decisions before the best design has emerged. Once it does emerge, there's so much written down already that it feels counterproductive to back up and rework the interfaces. These languages create a penalty for rewriting that encourages working around early design mistakes rather than fixing them. I believe this  dependence on interfaces before code is a major reason for programs being so much bigger than they used to be.",1295844204

For me it really is as simple as finding something, anything that I can get done.  One example: I needed to update the sales copy on one of my landing pages, but for some reason didn't want to get started.  What did I do?  I started by changing the background color of the site.  Something easy that took just a couple of minutes, then when I'd finished testing that and found it to be an improvement, I moved to changing the headline on the page and eventually the whole sales copy.",1295842641

The goal then becomes to determine which are which, and to move oneself toward the truth. It assumes that there is some method of comparison, and that not all solutions are equal.  It does not assume that the way is clear and unambiguous, nor that the truth is all on one side.<p>Compare Western medicine with homeopathy. I'd wager my life that there is no such thing as water memory.  But at the same time, the placebo effect is definitely real.  Where a absolutist would argue that modern medicine has nothing to learn from homeopathy, and a relativistic would argue that from within each system each is equally 'true' for its adherents, a rationalist will feel comfortable disbelieving in the surface explanations of homeopathy while at the same time trying to understand how modern medicine could be improved.",1295842150

2134212,comment,2133822,2133822,0,0,syllogism,,,"> There are plenty of good reasons not to be a rationalist. In fact, valuing the truth as a sort of Platonic ideal to which everything else must be subservient is an arbitrary moral choice in a universe where moral facts are either non-existent or inaccessible.<p>The rationalists' position is that believing true things is almost always strategically superior to believing untrue things. This is an empirical claim, not one about ""Platonic ideals"". You can choose to value whatever you want, but presumably you have some ends you want to achieve, which requires decision making, which is usually assisted more by true beliefs than by false beliefs.<p>Now, there's some evidence about cases where this might not be true. The blog post raises this about happiness surveys, etc. This evidence seems to me to weakly establishes a negative correlation, but not necessarily that rationality causes less happiness. At any rate, for any particular subgoal (say, becoming better at programming, achieving material wealth, etc), believing true things is probably going to be good strategy. That's the rationalist claim, anyway. For happiness in general, it gets murkier.<p>Yudkowsky also has a whole thing about how a rationalist can still win at Newcomb-like problems. The gist of it is, what's rational is whatever will meet your goals. This means if you need to preserve some false beliefs, you should go ahead and do that.<p>For example, you may find false beliefs about how long a project will take motivate you to get started. If you really accepted that your project would take a long, long time to bear fruit, maybe you'd never have begun, and you'd have been worse for that. In this case you've got this other irrationality about how you're weighing future benefits that you're compensating for by lying to yourself about how far into the future you'll reap your rewards.<p>Here, the two irrationalities together take you to a local maximum. If you only got rid of the false belief about the project times, you'd be worse off. But, if you could get rid of both irrationalities you'd be _better_ off. You wouldn't have the motivation problem AND you could plan more efficiently.<p>But maybe you just can't get rid of your tendency to over-discount future benefits. If so, you should just accept the local maximum, rather than anti-strategically attacking your tendency to underestimate project costs and leaving yourself worse off.<p>You could make a similar argument about religion and many other false beliefs. Which local maxima we can realistically step beyond is another empirical question. But I think it's clear that there are many false beliefs that are strictly negative: that is, you're better off without them, even if you don't change anything else about your thinking.",1295841962

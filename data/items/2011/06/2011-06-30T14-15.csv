2714248,comment,2713330,2713875,3,0,z0r,,,">Another evil I forgot to mention about minimum wage earier is the trap effect. Imagine your effective wage is worth less than minimum wage, but you've managed to land a dead-end job making minimum wage. Now you have a disincentive to refocus on something that would make you more valuable than minimum wage.<p>There are plenty of incentives to make better than minimum wage. Minimum wage doesn't exactly net you a luxurious quality of life. On one hand, it makes sense that if you allow the purchase of labour to be completely subject to the rules of supply and demand, information about what is needed where and most efficiently will spread through the network of economic activities. But labour has several disadvantages when compared to other commodities. Focusing on just one, it is expensive and time consuming for a person to upgrade the kind of labour they can provide. Education isn't cheap, and you have to support yourself while you obtain it. Being able to earn minimum wage while going through school helps to open up the opportunity to learn more valuable skills for many people. Unless your intention is to leave people from disadvantaged economic backgrounds out in the cold and allow their difficulties to propagate from generation to generation, there needs to be some mechanism to level the playing field, if only a little. My own tendencies would be towards even more socialist measures than just the minimum wage, but at least it puts a floor on how bad things can get.",1309445517

It's more that the politics moved the project into the least tenable position. I don't know if there's a complete history somewhere, but just some things I managed to piece together from Wikipedia articles:<p>Berkeley wouldn't cooperate with development on the 4.4BSD-Lite modified kernel, so in 1987 HURD decided to go with the Mach microkernel. But then they waited 3 years for licensing issues to clear up before investing any real effort into it. CMU stopped work on Mach in 1994, so HURD switched to Utah Mach. Utah stopped working on it in 1996. GNU kept working on that one under the name GNU Mach. And then (from Wikipedia): ""In 2002, Roland McGrath branched the OSKit-Mach branch from GNU Mach 1.2, intending to replace all the device drivers and some of the hardware support with code from OSKit. After the release of GNU Mach 1.3, this branch was intended to become the GNU Mach 2.0 main line; however, as of 2006, OSKit-Mach is not being developed.<p>As of 2007, development continues on the GNU Mach 1.x branch, and is working towards a 1.4 release.""<p>In 2004, an effort was started to move to a more ""modern"" microkernel. L4 was the first and it died almost immediately. Work started toward the Coyotos microkernel, but between 2007 and 2009, focus shifted to Viengoos. But then ""As of 2011, development on Viengoos is paused due to Walfield lacking time to work on it. In the meantime, others have continued working on the Mach variant of Hurd.""",1309442977

2714044,comment,2713330,2713330,1,0,erikb,,,"In Germany I often see unpaid interns, but actually not in a bad situation. There are 2 situations in Germany when an unpaid internship will happen: One is, when the students working as interns are still going to their schools and maybe are first or second semesters. So actually they don't really create value, but they cost time, energy, working hours of coworkers, electricity, rent and so on. The company basically already pays a load to have this intern sitting there and a high chance to get no value back in return. I think in this situation it is quite fair, not to pay wages.<p>The second situation is, when students try to get a job, which a lot of people want to have, like at Google, Price Waterhouse Coopers and so on. In this situation the brand alone will help them out later to get better jobs or even give them a chance for a full time job in this company that others can't get. It's a little like doing a start-up. You put in a lot for the small chance to get a unnatural big payoff.<p>In both situations I can't disapprove of unpaid internships. I hope with sharing these experiences, other readers might get a more objective point of view. It is not all bad about unpaid internships!",1309442713

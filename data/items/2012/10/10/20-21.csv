Traditionally, when people hear ""desktop version"", they think: ""the version that runs on desktop and laptop PC, as opposed to mobile devices like tablets and phones."" This distinction doesn't hold for Windows 8, because the ""desktop"" version of IE10 isn't alone on Windows 8. Windows 8 UI will run the ""mobile"" version (loosely speaking) of IE10.<p>Based on this, we have the following:<p><pre><code>                        Windows UI  |  Desktop\n    ================================+================                    \n    Tablet or phone :   Affected    |  N/A\n    Desktop or laptop:  Affected    |  NOT affected</code></pre>",1349902606

He thought that it might be likely that some browser APIs would become locked down by platform vendors.

For example, apache may use 10x VIRT memory because it is threads-based (most linux'es reserve about 6-10M VIRT memory for the stack of each thread). VIRT memory is usually considered ""free to allocate"" and software (JVM, soft that uses mmap and so on) is written with this assumption. But this is not the case with OpenVZ VPS servers. Just run ""top"" to get an idea about VIRT and RSS memory usage of common programs.<p>It is exciting how this issue is not well-known. I even think that 91.318% of ""apache is memory hungry"" things (they are still partially true, but..) came from OpenVZ VPS benchmarks.<p>So in my opinion 20$ 512MB XEN is way better than 10$ 512MB OpenVZ because 512MB XEN is very different from 512MB OpenVZ.<p>P.S. my knowledge of OpenVZ may be outdated because I moved from OpenVZ VPS servers a couple of years ago.",1349902228

That's the whole point of renting in a reputable apartment complex--it pushes the responsibility and and liability for security in the common areas to the building management, an insured entity with the resources to pay for any resulting damages.<p>I think people who are proponents of AirBnB dramatically underestimate how much monetary value people attach to the kind of people they live around, especially in city apartment buildings where lots of people who barely know each other live in close proximity. A condo in a building that has some fraction of renters can sell for substantially less than an identical condo in an identical building that is 100% owner-occupied. Rents at buildings with 12-month minimum leases are higher than rents in buildings with 1-month minimum leases. People go out of their way to buy into coop buildings that have minimum down payment requirements, etc.<p>I live in an apartment in downtown Chicago. The major businesses in the area are Northwestern Memorial Hospital and Northwestern University. Thus, most of the residents are medical residents, nurses, graduate students, etc. This tenant composition is priced into my rent. We have a lot of families that live here because it's a bit away from all the tourists on Michigan Ave and because every tenant undergoes a background check. If a bunch of tenants started illegally subletting their apartments on AirBnB to aforementioned tourists, that would upend everyone's expectations and decrease the value of the building to all of us.",1349901895

And the best you can do is a 311 complaint, which feels somewhat dick-ish.<p>>A lot of the regulations that seem obviously protectionist now really weren't at the time they were implemented.<p>True. Somewhat analogous to the law of unintended consequences. One potential way to address this would be through the use of sunset provisions: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunset_provision"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunset_provision</a> .\nThe downside of using sunset provisions would be the regulatory volatility given our (somewhat) hyperpartisan regulatory environment.<p>You can usually tell whether a regulation is obviously protectionist, by what the incumbents say about it. Incumbents are basically paid to say exclusively the things that improve their business prospects/competitive position/share prices. It's almost a fiduciary duty. As a consequence, when the a hotel company CEO complains about AirBNB or a medallion owner complains about Uber, you'll notice that they are usually asking for these services to be banned, (or regulated into uncompetitiveness) rather than regulated. In the example cited on the post - the duopolies never asked for the new service to be regulated to their standards - they simply asked to ban it. Even more egregious are moves like the DC City Council repeatedly trying to generate a whole new set of laws just to deal with Uber.<p>Anytime an incumbent objects to the illegalness or dubious legal position of a new service, you can pretty much bet its because they feel threatened. The fact that it happens to be in the ""public interest"" (in terms of the service doing something that's against today's law) is merely secondary.<p>> Regulations follows business as much as business follows regulations.<p>A lot of real insight in this comment. Regulations and laws are mostly what society agreed was allowable last time we decided to negotiate it. While we (as startups/consumers/businesspeople/engineers) should always strive to do the right thing, we should also remember that in many cases, the ""right"" thing can be considered illegal (if this wasn't the case, laws would never change to reflect society's current preferences).",1349901809

And, while there are loss carry-forward rules, it doesn't help your risk profile because it's game over if you hit bankruptcy by not having enough cash at hand to pay debts and expenses (and your assets get sold at a steep firesale discount).<p>Now, to be fair, we have no way of knowing if 3% is too much for his risk profile.  It may or may not be.  But, business risk is also difficult to estimate.  As it is, it is difficult enough for the business owner.  What chance does a bureaucrat who never owned a business or worked a normal job have?",1349901693

Every time you learn that you are wrong - and this applies for everything in life, not just with programming - you never have to be wrong in that way ever again.  Not for the rest of your life, if you can remember, will you be wrong in that particular way.  How amazing is that?<p>You're not 'focusing on the negatives', you're getting to be wrong, a fantastic opportunity.  Most people don't get to be wrong.  They persist in their wrongness and swim about in a sea of mediocrity with no sense of personal advancement.  To get to be wrong on a regular basis is nothing short of exciting.  Sure, others will misunderstand it.  Managers and business types will not understand why you simply couldn't do everything flawlessly from the start and they'll try to give you a hard time about it.  But it doesn't really matter.  No matter how hard they push you, they can't make you think.  No one can.  It has to be undertaken entirely under your own will.  And when you do so and come up with something wrong - you know you are actually guiding yourself to develop rather than stagnate.<p>Go on, be wrong!  And then never be wrong in that way ever again!",1349901660

4638025,comment,4636735,4637159,2,0,joshtynjala,,,"This has been the basic formula for cameo appearances on SNL for many, many years. It was a little more simplified this time around, though. Typically, a cameo like that happens after an SNL cast member has made their impersonation a recurring bit from week to week. On the cameo night, the cast member will make an especially big ass of themselves in character, and then the real person will come out with a serious look on their face. The cast member will act like they're in big trouble, and it always gets cheap laughs.

The simulation argument essentially depends on the fact that a universe that reaches simulation-capability ends up simulating more rational beings than half of the beings that exist in the universe itself.  But it's possible that the simulations themselves are so limited that they can only simulate some fraction of the universes' number of rational beings.  In fact, that seems likely: it seems that any simulation of this universe which obeys the same laws as this universe must be smaller than this universe.  ""How much smaller?"" is the glitch.

By contrast, iOS and (as of recently) Android are effectively Flash-free platforms.<p>I think the fact that there's no restriction on desktop, combined with their published requirements for how to get whitelisted for mobile, make it pretty clear that this isn't really meant to be an attack on Flash.  It's more an attempt to deal with the large number of websites whose Flash content is fundamentally incompatible with touchscreens because it assumes the presence of a mouse.  Blocking Flash on those sites hopefully results in a better user experience because the site is theoretically degrading to a Flash-free version instead.<p>Far from being a Flash-killing move, in hindsight the other mobile platforms adopting a similar policy might have been the one thing that could have saved Flash for them.",1349899966

You pay us, we reduce costs or boost revenues to pay for the service ten times over. The description certainly appealed to the firm's employees; we'd like to think that our analytical rigor and probing, independent viewpoint added value. Our jobs were supporting a raw, logical, business-driven decision.<p>But the longer I stayed in the field, the more I realized that making money was <i>rarely</i> the reason a case got purchased. There were situations where a short project would've had ROI's in the tens of millions of dollars if implemented, but never got picked up.<p>The real product we were selling were <i>careers</i>. Buyers would bring in the firm to help themselves hit specific milestones or objectives they had for themselves. Did we benefit the company in achieving those? Greatly. But the reason people were willing to pay hundreds of thousands of dollars a month were because of the coaching, the 'white-glove service', and the network a successful case would entail. They were buying a promotion to SVP, the key results which got them their own division, or the track record to shoot for the CEO spot for the next company.<p>Jason's tips are pragmatic - over-deliver on value so that your customer never even tries to do the math and price according to how they pay are two great ways to grease the purchasing pathway. But understanding the customer's pain and guiding them towards their aspirations will have them fighting for your service, budgets be damned.",1349899739

There are some cases where you can speed it up, like Intel emulator images and if you are lucky hardware OpenGL support, but these don't cover all the cases you often need to test, and many developers don't know about them or don't have systems that can use them anyway. So it being difficult to run the emulator fast is the main point of pain, which is the same thing making it tough for the company to scale in this case.

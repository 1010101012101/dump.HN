They are consistently technically uninformed and making no progress as the years go one. You will routinely see articles like this one where there is a story but they get it wrong. If they are going to fill the space, they should do it adequately.<p>Consider this article:<p><pre><code>   Bigger Benefits Up North
     Because Anchorage has 85 days a year with less than 8 
     hours of daylight, any benefit over the tradition [sic]
     lighting architecture are compounded. 
</code></pre>
That is their first big benefit of the lights in the article. And during winter it is true, but what about summer when the sun barely sets? Doesn't that make streetlights less useful? Doesn't this all come out in the wash? Is the 50% reduction in power use enough?<p>Shoddy journalism, mountains of ads (69 items loaded for this article), and suppression of source articles (this one is just a summarization of a press release published elsewhere , but good luck finding the link. The first couple that look likely are just links back into treehugger) should not be tolerated at ""One of the most influential tastemakers"".",1217523584

If essays (like pg essays) are programs, list articles are like pseudo-code: they're bite-sized tidbits that give you an outline of what the author thinks the major points of his writing is about.<p>The problem with lists is usually two-fold:<p><i>If</i> the list lists trivial and common-sense ideas without telling you why or how that works, it has very little value. This type work best as an element <i>inside</i> of an essay or as supporting arguments for another single central idea.<p><i>On the other hand</i> the list items are non-trivial, the list format works against a full fleshing out of the non-trivial idea : the readers' focus is diluted by the other points and the points each get so long that the whole article is essentially a series of essays, boring the reader to tears.<p>Lists are powerful; use with caution.",1217523219

263130,comment,262969,263009,0,0,BenS,,,"The only argument I buy here is Jessica's. I agree that  corporate vc could limit exit options.<p>However, I think Fred's general arguments against corporate vc don't fully apply to Google. First, Google probably does have the talent in-house to identify and nurture young businesses. Google has a perspective on what kind of web businesses can create long-term value that few VC's can match. That business insight is paired with a huge amount of technical expertise and infrastructure that would be invaluable for a young startup.<p>As for the argument about corporations having misaligned incentives, that almost certainly depends on how the investment entity is structured. Fred is right that a single exit is not a recurring revenue stream, but I assume that like any VC, Google would want to show regular long-term returns. VC is an industry where performance is already spotty. I believe that Google has as good a chance as any firm to deliver better than market returns.<p>Overall, I think it's premature to make a blanket statement without understanding how the investment arm at Google is structured or staffed. I personally would be excited to get Goog investment.",1217521419

At the end of the week, the teams would then present their ideas to a panel of judges (including angel investors).  We're still playing with the format, but the ultimate idea is that the best ideas generated from the Startup A Day site would then feed into the Startup A Week show.

Public Speaking<p>Join a ToastMasters, where you will make prepared or impromptu speeches, evaluate other's speeches, and generally just learn how to do public speaking. A lot of them will let you sit there and ""audit"" a few weeks before joining in the more active roles.<p>2. Writing<p>Write something that requires you to explain your logic flow clearly. Then take it to a friend who's a good writer and/or Enlish major or reads alot. Watch him tear your paper apart and tell you which logical points need to be linked better, or why certain annecdotes are out of place or generally why your thoughts can or cannot be easily followed. Writing isn't enough, you need to be critiqued to see the difference between yourself and Tolkien or other really good writers. If you don't have a friend, read a short story analytically and read as many commentaries on it as you can find. You'll see how well-written pieces are constructed together as carefully as beautiful code: their logic flow is good, the comments are helpful, witty and to the point without being redundant, and every idea (object) or plot device (function) is used on purpose, executed at exactly the right time. You cannot write well until you know how to recognize <i>why</i> good writing is good.<p>3. Self-management<p>Stop reading HN, or at least use noprocrast. A really good thing I heard from somewhere on the internet is to represent yourself as your own business, even when you don't have one: you don't work for ""the man"", you work for yourself. Your business is merely in partnership with the company that hired you. They don't own your work, you provide a service for them that they purchase. You represent yourself, you work for yourself, you sell your product/services yourself. In short : you manage yourself.",1217520542

Where I sit there watching youtube for hours because I know nothing I will do there will matter anyway.  Where the best way to get ahead is not by creating real wealth, but is to jostle with my coworkers for the favor of the people handing out the wealth.<p>Fear is a powerful motivator.",1217520307

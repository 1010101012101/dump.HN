Jailbreaking on iOS is commonly used as a means of sideloading, but don't conflate the concepts.<p>If Microsoft is really going to prohibit its hardware manufacturers from throwing up roadblocks to sideloading, the way AT&T does with its Android phones, then good for Microsoft, but this story doesn't include any details on that point.<p>edit: It's pretty slimy to reappropriate the word ""unlock"" in a mobile context.

Why modify your expectations when there isn't much you can do about it? Higher expectations are only useful when they can manifest as action, but there's an incredibly high bar for pulling your kid out of a school and sending them to another, or going to home schooling, or anything else. Expectations are fading because we are internalizing the idea that they don't matter; no matter what you put in, you get the same output.<p>I think we can fiddle around with the details but until we actually open up some sort of market and competition the problem will simply never be fixed. Centralized management doesn't work; schools aren't an exception.<p>Doesn't mean that I want everyone to have to pay for schools. Vouchers are at least a decent idea, even if they still distort the market and raise prices. But without some ability for parents to use the tools of the market to beat low performing schools, possibly unto them going out of business and letting other schools start, we're not going to see improvement.

I didn't much care for Picasso's celebrated works, although I knew that he was at least a competent artist in the traditional sense as well as the modern.

With Private Investing, entrepreneurs can raise capital from friends, family, and other community members who they already have a relationship with and these people can get unlimited financial upside based on a % of revenue. This is a security. Given that it's a security, we help entrepreneurs easily comply with all necessary federal and state regulations that apply. Compliance is not too challenging because all of the entrepreneurs are raising less than $1M from people they have a relationship with, so the security has exempt status. And you're right - there is no public solicitation.<p>With Public Investing, anyone in the general public can invest. This is not a security as investors do not have financial upside -- through revenue share agreements, they are repaid their principal and if they are repaid before the investment term is up, their share of the revenues for the rest of the term goes to a non-profit. Given that this is not a security, entrepreneurs can market it as widely as they'd like.<p>I hope that helps clear up some of the confusion.

While the same social norms were behind both corporate rules and also rules for school teachers, the rules for school teachers were many times stricter because of much greater pressure from the community. And if you look at the union rules for firing teachers, it's pretty clear that they were crafted in part to make it more difficult for a teacher to get fired due to a few parents putting pressure on the principal. Because if these rules didn't exist, then most principals would take the easy out and fire that teacher every time regardless of whether or not they actually did anything wrong. Because unlike at IBM, the principal doesn't lose any money for firing a good teacher; all that happens is they get rid of a headache, so the incentives are aligned to reward principals for harming students.

I remember seeing the primary document with the complete list of rules for schoolteachers in my history of education class, but I have no idea how I'd even find it right now.<p>If you look back through the primary documents relating to education though it's pretty crazy how much of a role religion plays. For example, the first compulsory education law in the United States was the Ye Old Deluder Satan Act, the first half of which I'll paste below:<p>""It being one chief project of that old deluder, Satan, to keep men from the knowledge of the Scriptures, as in former times by keeping them in an unknown tongue, so in these latter times by persuading from the use of tongues, that so that at least the true sense and meaning of the original might be clouded and corrupted with love and false glosses of saint-seeming deceivers; and to the end that learning may not be buried in the grave of our forefathers, in church and commonwealth, the Lord assisting our endeavors. It is therefore ordered that every township in this jurisdiction, after the Lord hath increased them to fifty households shall forthwith appoint one within their town to teach all such children as shall resort to him to write and read, whose wages shall be paid either by the parents or masters of such children, or by the inhabitants in general, by way of supply, as the major part of those that order the prudentials of the town shall appoint; provided those that send their children be not oppressed by paying much more than they can have them taught for in other towns.""<p>Essentially the reason why it started becoming compulsory for town to build schools is that the government thought that children, if left to their own devices, would be corrupted by satan. And these same beliefs are also the basis of how we treat not only our children, but also our school teachers right up to this day. Hardly a week goes by in the US where there isn't a story about a teacher being fired for having a picture of themselves drinking on Facebook, breaking up an assault on a gay student, assigning a book that mentions sex, etc. Of course this mostly happens in small towns in the south; the more 'enlightened' areas of the country have already mostly switched to having their teachers teach f om entirely pre-made curricula geared toward passing standardized tests, a system which was implemented partly to prevent these 'problems' from occurring.<p>Also, if I remember correctly even pg once commented that the reason he wasn't allowed to give his high school graduation speech is that the principal wouldn't have been able to get him fired if the parents complained.",1291050158

E.g. computing the width of one element and setting it based on the width of another element on the page, before the content of that other element has been fully rendered.<p>If it works in Chrome but not FireFox, it usually indicates a problem with the JavaScript executing too slowly. E.g. firing off an intensive process, like manipulating 100 elements on the page at once, and then firing off another action that depends on the previous process being completed. If the JavaScript execution is slow, it's possible to fire off the next event while the other is still being processed.<p>In this case you'll want to either have the previous function fire off an event when it's completed, and bind the next function to that event, or brute force it with a setTimeout.<p>Wow, that was way longer than I meant it to be. Oh well, hope it helps.",1291050017

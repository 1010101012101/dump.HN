But given that explosives are subtle and dangerous, I think it&#x27;s reasonable to require that people using them be licensed, including extensive practical exams, and that they be properly insured, which may include insurance company inspections and the like. They&#x27;re welcome to make the choice to light any given fuse, but given the potential consequences it should be an informed, responsible choice that has fully accounted for the consequences.",1448038782

That being said:<p>I use FreeBSD and (obviously) prefer it, but:<p>1) ZFSonLinux has made huge steps forward and actually (at least in my opinion) is production ready and rock solid (of course it&#x27;s not as good as ZFS on FreeBSD though, for example it&#x27;s lacking some features and of course it&#x27;s not as proven as of now)<p>2) Usable containers finally have come to Linux in the form of Docker and everybody is absolutely hyped about it (I would argue though that Jails has more features, is more stable and mature)<p>The most obvious reason for me to use FreeBSD though is just the difference in philosophy. Don&#x27;t rapidly make big changes, think everything through, don&#x27;t surprise users, don&#x27;t make upgrades that call for massive user intervention, and it&#x27;s democratically governed and yes, it&#x27;s a complete OS. Code quality is also better (have you actually looked at what code makes it into the Linux Kernel?), and I would argue therefore security and stability is way better.<p>Just my 2 cents, nothing wrong with Linux, have used it for years, now I would not want to go back though.<p><i>And a small Side Note: No systemd, not to start a flame war, but it is taking over the linux-sphere and I find it&#x27;s design just horrific </i>",1448038247

FreeBSD feels like Linux used to - always having to hack around and try to research how to make it work and nothing quite working smoothly (on the desktop - less of an issue for servers, where FreeBSD has always shined). Linux has reached a point where I use Linux as my primary desktop OS, and it works great. FreeBSD for the desktop feels like a step backwards.<p>Some things in FreeBSD are painful. I can use both FreeBSD and linux pretty efficiently and get done what I want.<p>That said, I have the opposite impression you have.  To me, Linux seems like a hack and a step backwards.<p>For one, since linux as a kernel only covers so much area, distributions are left to curate how many of the design decisions go down.<p>Put yourself in the shoes of a developer who goes out of his or her way to learn upstart, for instance. You invest a good part of your time into the codebase, with a sense of confidence you&#x27;re going to be able to utilize this onward in your career and future projects.<p>Then you find, this system you spent time learning is now obsolete and you have to relearn everything, There&#x27;s systemd.<p>Imagine if this  were to happen every few years with a new piece of software.

Well, mir isn&#x27;t &quot;done&quot; yet, and even if it was ready, other software has to integrate with it. There is a huge collaboration that has to take place between developers learning how mir works, and keep in mind, they&#x27;re getting exacerbated having a new system replace the old every couple of years.  Then you have to manage the snafu of packaging it and how you engineer a switch like mir into the release.<p>Linux may seem more bleeding edge than BSD, but this is only a veneer.  To developers, it&#x27;s hell having your investment in learning something dashed away and having your time put into some venture you may or may not agree with.<p>BSD drastically simplifies these pains for devs.  There is something called the &quot;principle of least surprise&quot;. As well, freebsd&#x27;s base system includes tools like rc(8), package management, etc. which in turns gives a vastly more cohesive experience.<p>I appreciate the work of both systems greatly - but few give a really care to the <i>real</i> reason you see drama over things like systemd.

Look also at the number of targeted killings of terrorists over recent years (e.g. Jihadi John) which I would assume were aided by digital monitoring.<p>And the terrorists are aware of the above and are now training their followers to use apps like Telegram.<p>With 7 billion people in this world, preventing every single attack by mass surveillance alone is impossible.

If so, how did they control for this?<p>The experimental group is impoverished people with worms. The control group is impoverished people <i>without</i> worms.<p>From the article:<p>> The researchers tried to answer the question by analyzing data on the Tsimane people who live in the Amazon rainforest of Bolivia.<p>> The roughly 16,000 Tsimane survive mainly by hunting, fishing, and raising crops such as rice and plantains. Their homeland is prime parasite country. About 15% to 20% of them harbor Ascaris, and 56% of them carry hookworms. Infected women in the study usually were unaware they were playing host to the parasites, Blackwell says.",1448035263

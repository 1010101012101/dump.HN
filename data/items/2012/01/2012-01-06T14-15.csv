How do you find out what this is? By building that which must be built. When you get stuck, you will have to find a way to get unstuck: by getting educated, by consulting others, by finding others' solutions, or just by old fashioned figuring it out.<p><i>How often?</i><p>Continuously.<p><i>How should I decide what to work on?</i><p>Work on what needs to be worked on, not what you need to get better at. Any other approach would be backwards.<p>By definition, the ""Competency Matrix"" you cite is a bad goal. Every entry has different level of importance for every person and every situation. By trying to aspire to this flawed ideal, you will be wasting time on things that aren't important and missing things that are.<p>(Aside: When I reviewed the Competency Matrix, I had to laugh. Many of the items were so important that you couldn't help getting better at them just by building lots of stuff. And many will never be important at all.)<p>The best way to get good at what you should be getting good at is to build what needs to be built. Then trust the process and yourself to fill in the gaps.<p><i>Does my ability relative to others matter?</i><p>No! There will always be many people better than you. There will always be many people worse than you. You will probably be the best at something (or some combination of skills). You will probably never get very good at something (or some combination of skills). And you know what? It doesn't matter!<p>All that matters is whether or not you can successfully build that which must be built. The ability to figure out what that is and how to do that is the most important skill of all.<p>Moral of the story: Go find out what people need. Then build it. The more you become concerned with their needs and the less about your own, the sooner you'll take care of both.",1325861581

Wait until you need to do something you didn't think of and you find it's useless/too complex/unnecessary and so on.<p>I find that the best way to evaluate yourself is to look at your code all the time and think critically. Be careful not to overdo it though, maybe take a closer look in between projects or in some interval is fine.<p>What should you work on? What do you find interesting? I think you're a lot better off working on something you find interesting than forcing you into something that you don't find thrilling.

As the balloon rises, air pressure decreases.  The result is that the gas inside the balloon is compressed less as the balloon rises, causing the balloon to expand.<p>In a flight like jgc's, the latex balloon expands until it pops.  There are other balloons which can float at a steady altitude.  One of these is called a ""Zero-pressure Balloon.""  This balloon operates with a valve on the bottom.  The helium will expand until it reaches this valve, then spill out.  When the balloon loses helium, it loses lift. The valve will tend to dump helium until the balloon reaches neutral buoyancy.  These balloons are so named because the pressure at the valve is the same as the ambient atmospheric pressure.<p>Another type of balloon is called a ""Superpressure Balloon.""  These balloons maintain altitude by pressurizing internally.  Unlike latex, these balloons stop stretching at a certain altitude.  As soon as the balloon stops expanding, it maintains a constant volume.  Buoyancy is based on the volume of fluid displace, so a pressurized balloon maintains the same altitude.<p>I work with a group of hackers attempting to cross the Atlantic Ocean using a Zero-pressure balloon.

If your site is visited by tons of mobile visitors and you use the geo functionality to impact user experience, then for you, it may be.  However, most sites continue to have far more desktop usage than mobile, on average.  So, for most visitors to most sites, it's not really all that major. YMMV, of course.<p>In fact, GeoIP has suffered from the problem you describe for a decade now, from every AOL user appearing to come from Virginia, USA, all the way to modern corporate proxy systems which have vast numbers of visitors all appearing coming out of, say, White Plains, NY, USA (yes, there are lots of corps there... but not every employee works in that location).<p>So, your idea is a good one for mobile where we kind of know the big ""offenders"" (Kindle Fire may rise up to become an issue as well), but it's hard to figure this out for every IP.<p>Commercial GeoIP companies often offer a ""confidence value"" with their data which reflects how confident they are than an IP would really reflect the geo of the user; unclear if this service will have that.  In addition, a good user experience might be to personalize the session but allow user feedback, ala ""we think you are currently in Antarctica; click here to tell us where you really are...""  You might also decide not to use some functionality in your ""mobile skin"" or other version of the site, if you do separate designs for mobile vs. desktop.<p>I say, best of luck to them.  Web analytics continues to suffer from a disconnect: vast reporting on users, but little connection to taking that data and impacting a user's visit, even in future visits, much less in the same session.   Let's see some folks push this a bit, even if the data has some problems (which, let's face it, is always a problem with any data involving the web, imho).",1325859265

If they can - as trained negotiators and analysts  - get a better deal, they will take that opportunity.<p>Not only have I received an impression that the above is as it is at seed and series A stages, but also at far later stages until around about the time that a startups equity begins have liquidity (i.e. trading begins on second markets etc).<p>The question I am alluding to here, HN, is - Are there market participants, invisible or ignored in my readings, that act to represent founders in negotiations?",1325859072

Education should be primarily about furthering knowledge, not finding a job.<p>I couldn't agree with you more, but unfortunately I didn't feel this way as an undergrad. While I did enjoy the field of engineering, I was ready to be a ""big boy"" and start chipping away at my student loans with a real income. Soon after starting my job I was blown away by the level of knowledge of my co-workers and it motivated me to push myself to learn more...about anything! I didn't come from a CS background so I didn't know much about programming or hacking, but I was always fascinated with electronics and technology so I decided to learn how to program. I didn't want to feel like a one trick pony. If I could do undergrad all over again I would have taken more classes that were far out of my realm, possibly even a dual major.

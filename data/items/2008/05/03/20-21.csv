They're discussing canning the project but appreciate I've put heart and soul into it, and are looking at all the options about how to go forward. Fortunately, one of those options includes keeping me on, so they're still paying me. This in itself is one of the lessons I've learned: I don't have to be perfect to be useful. Believe me, that's a <i>real</i> paradigm shift.",1209848365

180437,comment,180274,180287,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"I'm curious where you get the ""MySpace is about 4 times bigger"" number?  My understanding was that Facebook had grown to be larger than MySpace in some foreign markets, and that it was about half the size in the US.  It is still firmly in second place--MySpace usage is still growing roughly on pace with Facebook so Zeno gets his revenge--but certainly more than 25% as popular as MySpace.<p>I'm not saying Facebook is worth 15 billion (that'd be stupid...I'm talking Stave Ballmer level stupid), but one can't say they've lost to MySpace, when the market is still wide open worldwide, and Facebook seems to know how to execute internationally than MySpace.<p>But, I think Facebook will lose, in the end, to a few dozen companies that build a better garden without the walls.  Each will be smaller than Facebook, but they'll end the reign of Facebook and MySpace with a wholly different process of social networking.  (I think a single destination ""social portal"" is as doomed to failure as the whole web 1.0 ""portal"" idea turned out to be...portals will always be less interesting than the whole Internet, so when the whole Internet is socially enabled the social portals will falter.  The oracle has spoken.)",1209847674

You can install a patch that improves the balancer - <a href=""http://brainspl.at/articles/2007/11/09/a-fair-proxy-balancer-for-nginx-and-mongrel"" rel=""nofollow"">http://brainspl.at/articles/2007/11/09/a-fair-proxy-balancer...</a> - but it still isn't as nice as HAProxy<p>With HAProxy the status of the system is visible. For the largest site I use HAProxy on I keep my status page public - <a href=""http://userscripts.org/haproxy"" rel=""nofollow"">http://userscripts.org/haproxy</a> - but it isn't required.<p>HAProxy is particularly good for rails since you can say each app server can only have 1 request at any time.  This makes requests queue at the HAProxy layer, so if an app server has a request that takes a extra long time you don't have requests waiting for that app server to finish - instead you wait for the next available app server in a FIFO queue.<p>Combining HAProxy with munin gives great stats for tuning your system - whereas just nginx with the patch had no visibility into where bottlenecks might be.<p>I",1209847374

It was like George Foreman's comeback, proving that an old dog can learn new tricks and stomp all over the youngsters in the field.<p>Anybody that's not looking at Linus (for a second time, if you were around for the beginning of Linux, or for the first time) with a sense of wide-eyed amazement just isn't paying attention.  He's now helped reinvent <i>two</i> entire industries.  git is pretty revolutionary...it builds on the shoulders of giants, just like Linux did previously, but it makes the leap that no one else as made and puts it into a simple package (Mercurial and darcs and bazaar all come close, of course, but all have a ""research project"" feel to them in several important areas--partly because git came last in the line and could learn from their mistakes, but the same is true of almost every great idea).",1209847130

I've learned that I am (as I suspected) fallible. I've also learned that most ""civilians"" don't know what they want from software, even though they think they do. And I've learned that you can't please everyone, and it's futile to try. I might write this one up some time, but the fat lady ain't singing just yet.",1209846847
180429,comment,180311,180311,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"I've used pen, Squid, and LVS.  All useful for different situations, though LVS is just not practical for the vast majority of situations.<p>PerlBal looks really cool, as being written in Perl means it has some of the same kinds of flexibility that Squid has (a good reason for Squid is that you can write your own balancing algorithm in any language you like in a redirector script--I always used Perl, or Python when I was working with the Zope guys--so, you can actually do crazy stuff like choose the right server based on keeping them ""primed"" for the content users are asking for based on URL, or you can use destination URL hashing and achieve the same effect even if you have millions of URLs).  Squid also has experimental support for ESI (Edge Side Includes) which is pretty awesome...build a page from disparate and wholly unrelated servers using a simple templating system, and caching them.  I don't think any other Open Source product out there has ESI (experimental or otherwise).",1209846527

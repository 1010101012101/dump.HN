I have a Google Cardboard-style rig that I use with my Galaxy Note 3.<p>From my own experience, working with a keyboard at a desk doesn&#x27;t really work well, for various reasons. For one, it&#x27;s pretty restricting to the movement, and trying to scale the tracking to compensate so you can view a full 360 degrees in a shorter head-swing is both still limiting because you can&#x27;t perform multiple rotations, and is still extremely disorienting. For another, having a physical sensation of a fixed object that isn&#x27;t reflected in the visual display also breaks immersion. Also, if you have you move your hands off of the keyboard at all (like, to adjust the display on your face), it&#x27;s really hard to find it again.<p>There is currently no good way to do user input in VR.

8216482,comment,8216305,8216305,33,0,tikhonj,,,"The basic idea of looking at how we can improve workflows in editors is great, but I have issues with much of the actual analysis. Even the core premise—that all editors &quot;look the same&quot; is flawed. They only look the same to the extent that most of the screen is taken up by, of all things, <i>text</i>. In this sense, image editors also start looking suspiciously the same...<p>Image editors, of course, have all sorts of tools and buttons, not just the image. But this is just a function of the main modes of interaction: mouse vs keyboard. Unlike an image editor, a text editor is used almost exclusively by a keyboard, so most of the controls are optimally presented as keyboard shortcuts.<p>Then, the post goes on to argue by analogy: always a risky strategy. Would I put two pieces of paper side-by-side when I&#x27;m writing an essay? Probably not. But code is not text; often, I <i>do</i> want to compare two pieces of code next to each other, line-by-line... which is done perfectly by putting them next to each other. And the rest of the paragraph goes on to pretty much describe my Emacs workflow[1] anyhow: I often have one main buffer and a bunch of random resources in another buffer which I periodically move around or swap. Sometimes, I also have a browser window or two open in the same way.<p>The buffers don&#x27;t overlap <i>per se</i>. In practice, they actually do: each one shows a <i>window</i> into the underlying text or image or whatnot, and can just show a small part. (Moreover, I can have <i>multiple</i> windows into one document, which is occasionally useful in practice). The only constraint is the physical grid... which I might use anyhow if it was easy with physical things. I lose a bit of flexibility in how things overlap in return for not having to worry about positioning and having everything line up nicely; a great compromise.<p>An important detail is that, in Emacs at least, open, closing and swapping panes is trivial. I constantly bring up new ones, look at new things in existing ones and then close them in the normal act of editing. Very transient, very flexible and largely possible because they <i>don&#x27;t</i> overlap so that we can lay out new ones automatically instead of giving me a floating window to manually drag out of the way.<p>My workflow still looks just like the wireframe in the blog post. Interesting.<p>In the end, this is just going from the cozy world of tiling window management into the frontier of floating windows. While it might be friendlier to newcomers, floating windows are simply not as good for experts and, presumably, most code editors <i>are</i> aimed at experts.<p>I would much rather take on a slightly worse learning curve to get my stuff laid out automatically, all from keyboard commands. My code editor is one of the tools I use the most, so the trade-off is a no-brainer.<p>In fact, by using Emacs, that&#x27;s exactly what I&#x27;ve already done!<p>[1]: <a href=""http://jelv.is/emacs-workflow.png"" rel=""nofollow"">http://jelv.is/emacs-workflow.png</a>",1408818127

Instead, build a relatively small solar satellite in orbit around the sun at the chosen distance, maybe between Mars and the asteroid belt. Then build another one, and connect them together. Keep doing that, working towards a ring around the sun. That part should be relatively simple, since each of the pieces would be in a stable orbit by itself.<p>If you still need more power after that, then you consider the ring to be the equator of a sphere, and start building out the rest of the sphere, one ring of latitude at a time. Maybe build it as a basic grid or something initially, and add the solar collectors as needed. The stress would probably start to get higher and higher as you built up and down, since the pieces wouldn&#x27;t be in orbit anymore, and so would rely on the structure to keep them in position and connected.<p>The problems in getting started are probably more along the lines of needing the kind of robot technology to gather the materials and build something like the initial satellite without much supervision, being able to gather the energy, and being able to do something useful with it.",1408818038

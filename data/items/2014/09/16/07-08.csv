I&#x27;ve noticed that VERY rarely are Apple products in the majority, BUT they have such a consistent branding that they stick out as the majority. Even if 1/3 of the laptops are Dell, or Lenovo (I&#x27;m guessing that accounts for about 70% of the laptops in my office of 60 people), each Dell or Lenovo model look so different from the next that they don&#x27;t have the brand impact that Apple has achieved.<p>Not disputing your point, but it&#x27;s an interesting take on perspective.",1410854355

However, I think he&#x27;s really only addressing one of the three ways that user data can be compromised when it&#x27;s held by a company:<p>1. Selling or using it internally (e.g. Google&#x27;s ad targeting)<p>2. Stolen by criminals (e.g. Apple&#x27;s recent snafu)<p>3. Requisitioned by the government (e.g. Yahoo&#x27;s daily fines for refusing to join PRISM)<p>Data that isn&#x27;t collected in the first place can&#x27;t be lost, but that isn&#x27;t always possible (and it often defeats the entire purpose of the service).<p>I think he&#x27;s mostly talking about the first one, that Apple hasn&#x27;t built their business around harvesting user data to feed advertising or other systems. I think that&#x27;s laudable. I would rather a company focus their energies on one product, rather than selling a byproduct of their real money maker. I also don&#x27;t really like being the fuel for a free service -- I&#x27;d rather pay for what I use and have everything above board.<p>Security is where I think Apple has its biggest problem with user privacy. Relative to companies like Google, they just aren&#x27;t very good at running Internet services. Despite operating several huge services (iTunes, a CDN that handles iOS updates, iCloud, etc.), they aren&#x27;t an Internet company at heart. Google and others are leaps and bounds above them in this regard.<p>They can improve this with hiring and changing the culture in those groups, and I think they started this process a year or two ago. It will take some time, and they&#x27;re never going to be the world&#x27;s best at this stuff.<p>Tim Cook touches on the third point a little, and some people think he is being disingenuous in his description of how iMessage works. I think that it doesn&#x27;t really matter. It&#x27;s great that Apple has designed a system that places an emphasis on keeping user conversations private, but there is literally nothing that they can do about government interference if they want to continue operating as a legal entity.<p>I hope that they do everything in their power to curb government overreach. Ultimately the government will get what they want. Simply building a system designed to keep you from accessing the data that flows through it is not sufficient: you will be forced to subvert that system or face serious consequences.<p>I strongly believe that the only way people will ever have privacy from the government again is to decentralize the Internet and the services that run on it. I doubt that a political solution is possible now that pandora&#x27;s box has been opened, and it seems like it will only become more widespread as companies have to answer to more governments around the world and the technology to broadly intercept traffic becomes more commonplace.",1410851730

With an MVP, you&#x27;d expect to be able to incrementally improve the design into a non-minimal one, but with a PoC there&#x27;s no real way to take it and &quot;refactor&quot; it into a shipping product at all. The design with modwires and a 10kg power supply (or the embedded-software equivalent) doesn&#x27;t share any similarities, except at the most abstract level, with the design that can be mass-manufactured.<p>Once you&#x27;re done experimenting and you know what you want, you really do need to design the &quot;production model&quot; from the top down, with all the layers that will enter into the solution considered in advance.<p>A concrete example: you can&#x27;t just &quot;write a voxel renderer&quot; and then expand it into a full game engine. If the full game engine will have a rendering pipeline with support for things like dynamic lighting and fur physics, then voxel rendering will be implemented in that engine in a completely different way than in one that <i>only</i> needs to render voxels.<p>Editing one into the other would be like editing the code defining a b-tree into code for a hash-table: there would be exactly one edit, which would replace all the old lines with entirely new ones.",1410851463

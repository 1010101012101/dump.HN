More precise manufacturing tolerances within the cylinder make bumping easier because the mechanical tolerances of the lock are smaller, which means there is less loss of force in other directions and mostly pins move more freely and smoothly. Locks made of hardened steel are more vulnerable because they are less prone to damage during the bumping process that might cause a cheaper lock to jam.""<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lock_bumping"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lock_bumping</a>",1358899128
5100487,comment,5099157,5100083,4,0,jmreid,,,"Well, you can see Apple's side of this, no? You're basically saying that you don't deserve the mature, ""internet app rating"" because your users as usually pretty quick at flagging things or that you have a safe default to catch the rest (which can be turned off by creating a 500px account and just turning it off). Both of these subvert Apple's built in parental controls and I'm guessing that's exactly why this happened. If there's a chance of mature stuff, you have to set your rating correctly.<p>Everyone already got all bothered about this ages ago. Apps that had built in web views had to set a mature rating because a user could then surf the web even if Safari was disabled.<p>I guess this comes down to what they've asked (yet?) of you. Can you resubmit the app with a higher age-restiction?",1358899105

You learn to find inward motivation - which is the best replacement there is to outward reward. The work you do is its own reward. With that, and the kind of commitment you showed in the research-work you did alone for years, you can take any challenge you want.<p>Certainly, you work will be dissected by the best experts in the domain, and they will criticize it in any way they can - basically, you can't cheat. You have to actually do something outstanding, for which you will be judged.<p>It seems to me that's what most people on HN love and value : being judged on the merit of your work. At least that's why I love and value.<p>The only problem with all this is IMHO that many (most?) who do a PhD  want to work in academia afterwards, to have the freedom to work on the topics they enjoy. I had the same failings - guilty as charged. I wanted to do something great and then to keep improving it in ways I saw fit. But I changed my ways (and got out of a tenure track in late 2012 - it's not for me)<p>I believe this is wrong, because anyone who wants to do that believes that its own interests are for some reason better than what the market values. It's good and all, do whatever you fancy, but not on my dime - not on public money. Get a real job.<p>I learnt a lot during my PhD - but more importantly I bootstrapped unknown capabilities to create knowledge - something that's bringing value in many things I do.<p>EDIT: for anyone interested, my last post on the topic and how my PhD in CS is currently coming into the real world 5 years later :\n<a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4871888"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4871888</a>",1358898615

Just like all the others who write about the same ""problem scope"" (hiring).<p>Questions and statements can provoke a think process, but is the person who provoked the think process qualified to do interviews? Let's solve the question arised from the ground up! The interviewer must have studied ""Communication studies"" or at least have significant knowledge in the field. Now don't underestimate that statement, even if it sounds far fetched. We already know that proper homework in Communication studies (and UX Design) was what made Apple a billion dollar company (amongst other things). The technology altough a key driver, was made by much larger companies too, without comparable success.<p>To put it differently: Just as a Software developer isn't qualified to do medical decisions, a Developer, CEO or other Interviewers can't decide about interviews like a communications research specialist. Let's not forget that everyone instinctively recognizes good music. But what makes music sound good? The Geometry of Music can provide accessible information using a revolutionary geometrical approach to music theory explored by Tymoczko <i>[1]. Now you might have an idea on how much more there is to it below the surface.<p>""The principal idea is that defining something as working or not may sound simple, but is of complex nature.""<p>Don't forget that regardless what has been asked or stated, the think process including the outcome is there to reveal the qualities of the PoI. But an interviewer, even if he's a developer himself, doesn't scientifically qualify to make statements appear like wisdom[2], whereas it's just a gut decision. No matter which fix-points an interviewer chooses for job qualifiers, it will not be complete without a proper analysis and reflection of the communication process. I mean, just make the effort and take a read about Harald Lasswell and Communication studies to get a broader understanding of what is neccessary for fundamental knowledge about what is working and what is not.<p>No excuses if I sound like a diva, I didn't have my mars yet.<p>Here's what I'd answer to the question:\nCSS Media Queries (iPhone), CSS Expressions (IE), Basic CSS Knowledge (Positioning) and the most important thing: ""Do you actually want the job and is the offer good for you?"" (Self-esteem)\nBecause coding isn't Rocket Science, applying UX to the interface would come close to that though (when done scientifically).<p>---\nSources:<p></i> [1] Dmitri Tymoczko - A Geometry of Music : Harmony and Counterpoint in the Extended Common Practice: Harmony and Counterpoint in the Extended Common Practice; <a href=""http://www.neuroscience-of-music.se/eng7.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.neuroscience-of-music.se/eng7.htm</a>\n* [3] <a href=""http://i3.minus.com/ibzQzwsY4Lmh5D.png"" rel=""nofollow"">http://i3.minus.com/ibzQzwsY4Lmh5D.png</a>",1358898514

5100319,comment,5099861,5100114,24,0,josevalim,,,"I am Elixir creator. There are a few downsides comparing Elixir today with Erlang. First, there are all trade-offs related to Elixir being a new language: we have fewer resources and a smaller community. Fortunately, Elixir community is growing very active (on IRC) and it is very likely you get some support on whatever you are tackling. Also, we haven't reached 1.0 yet, which means backwards incompatible changes may happen, but we do our best to properly deprecate them first.<p>Regarding the language features, since Elixir provides a macro system, you can apply to Elixir some of the same complaints people would apply to Lisp and meta-programming in general: i.e. people can definitely go overboard and write code that is hard to read and maintain (""magic""). On the other hand, Erlang does not provide macros and has a set of restrictions on how your code looks like (only one module per file, module forms cannot have custom expression, etc). At the end of the day, it boils down about Elixir giving you more power, but also requiring more responsibility from you to use it wisely. Some people prefer to work with a given set of strict rules.<p>Finally, we also do our best to have a regular and sane syntax (it is important after all to have sane macro behaviour). However, due to optional parenthesis, there is some space for ambiguity. Assuming you have a function named `abs`, `abs + 1` is treated as `abs() + 1` but `abs +1` as `abs(+1)`. Those cases are very few though and we also warn about them in the guide. It is one of the trade-offs you pay for having a more convenient syntax most of the times, so you can write:<p><pre><code>    defmodule Foo do\n      def bar do\n        1\n      end\n    end\n</code></pre>\nInstead of:<p><pre><code>    defmodule(Foo) do\n      def(bar()) do\n        1\n      end\n    end\n</code></pre>\nI believe this translates well some of the observations developers tell me when migrating from Erlang to Elixir.",1358897260

Gave them stats and all that.<p>Apple rejected it because we didn't prominently warn users that background GPS could affect their battery life. This was a good change, that we would not have made, had Apple not reviewed our app.<p>Sometimes it feels like developers think they have an inherent right to pollute whatever platform they want with their apps, just because they can write code.<p>If anything, I think Apple is not strict enough.

5100227,comment,5098873,5099914,7,0,geophile,,,"My research was on spatial query processing -- z-order-based techniques. The idea is to map spatial objects to one dimension by noting how a space-filling curve (z-order) passes in and out of the object. Overlapping objects can then be found by simple operations on 1-d data structures supporting random and sequential access, (e.g. sorted array, btree). I believe that the same transformation is used in geohashes.<p>The product is Akiban Server, a database system. I implemented nearest neighbor and point containment queries, and integrated it with our query optimizer. (You can download it from akiban.com and try it out.)",1358896019

Almost everyone on the panel was from an agency) - Khoi immediately spoke up and said he disagreed, saying that a balance/social life is still needed and important.

184246,comment,183964,183964,0,0,melvinram,,,"The question you are looking for is much deeper than ""people or code?"".<p>You are really looking to figure out who you are and what you care about in life. And this is not a simple answer. People usually have many parts/areas of their ""self"" that they need to define as time flows on. Some of areas include spirituality, profession, service, fitness, family, etc.<p>You have to decide what areas of your life are important to you and from there, decide if the current state of those areas are what you'd like. If not, you need to work on that area. You don't need a life revolution even though it may feel like it. You need evolution. Keep parts of your self that you like. Reinvent the rest.<p>Reminds me of a quote that goes something like this: ""Life is like a movie... You can either play an 'extra' in your life... or you can be the lead character.""",1210225471

(Perhaps living in an apartment the size of a closet puts a damper on ones desire to have rugrats in there with you?) The Japanese population may simply be correcting for the space and resources available, not vanishing in an x-files-esqe mystery as the over-sensationalized article suggests.",1210225379

How well does the back (280 North logo on what looks like a road) print out?<p>This is going to sound trivial, but to me, something about the text in the top-right corner on the white side seems off. I think the colors are too dark compared to what you have on the other side.<p>It might just be my monitor or the fact that they aren't in print to me. Otherwise, I really like the simplicity of the design. Very straight forward and too the point, which is good (and the big print also makes it easier to read).",1210225205
184242,comment,183846,183846,0,0,hooande,,,"Most apps labeled ""social"" these days should probably be labeled as ""consumer"", meaning they are intended to do ""business"" directly with the public.<p>Consumer websites have one of the lowest barriers to entry in the history of business. You don't have to know anyone, don't have to get a permit, don't have to do anything at all besides make your website and put it online. That's why they are popular to start and stories about them generate so much hype.<p>Consider this from another perspective for a moment, possibly your friend's perspective. Someone you know made something that you think is really cool and useful, but it probably isn't going to go anywhere. Trying to sell the ""B2B"" route requires connections, years of industry experience and nice suits. Odds are that neither of you have any of those things (or else I'd assume you'd be using them)<p>But what you can do is build a consumer app and hope the ""social"" side gains popularity. The very small chance of it becoming ""the next facebook"" (or insert ridiculously lofty goal inspired by dhh here) is probably about equal to the odds you'll be able to develop the B2B connections you need to do a good job of selling the product. Business relationships and reputation generally take years to develop and B2B customers are very demanding. It's theoretically possible (but unlikely) that a consumer app will be an ""overnight sensation"". That almost never, ever happens with B2B apps.<p>Lastly, we all want useful software. We just tend to talk about consumer software here on hackernews because that's the game we've chosen to play. I'm sure there are far, far less interesting sites out there devoted to B2B software hacking if you look for them.",1210225129
184241,comment,183964,183964,0,0,Tichy,,,"Like another commentator, I also get several compile errors trying to digest your question.<p>For example ""alienate my friends"" gives a compile error: if they are really your friends, being a reclusive from time to time wouldn't alienate them.<p>I have some friends from the arts scene, and my impression is that they are under a lot of pressure to be special and artsy. What made you think that they would be closer to life than hackers? At least hackers create something real, whereas most art is entirely virtual (in the eye of the beholder).<p>If you are doing something truly cutting edge, it will probably always be a lonely affair. Just try to find the right balance? You might also enjoy this letter from feynman to wolfram: <a href=""http://elzr.com/posts/wolfram-feynman"" rel=""nofollow"">http://elzr.com/posts/wolfram-feynman</a><p>Personally, I guess I am already spoiled by my involvement with computers. To me, people are ""just"" algorithms that run for a short amount of time, similar to threads in a computer system. In the long term, individual experiences don't matter much. In that sense, mathematics seem way more important to me than daily human struggles. A new mathematical formula could live for thousands of years. I am not sure about computer programs, but perhaps the same goes for some of them. Certainly they can outlive their creators.<p>I am not saying that daily human life is pointless (who is to judge)? I care about my people's happiness, too (including my own). I compromise to be reasonably popular (ie I invest time in buying nice clothes). But when I really think about it, mathematics seems so much more important and interesting.<p>Also, there might be environments that are more suited to you (or me). I imagined some universities to be like that, but it is hard or impossible to get into there (for example complex systems research in Santa Fe, or ycombinator). Trying to find the peer group where you really belong might be the ticket nevertheless. I am not sure how to do it, but just because neither the artsy people nor the hardcore hackers are for you, doesn't mean that there is no other group that would be suitable.",1210225053

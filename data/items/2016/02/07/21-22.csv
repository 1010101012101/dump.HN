Why didn&#x27;t I like it?<p>- The sameness.  Every house on the streets where I grew up looked virtually identical, as did the neighborhood where I bought my first house.  It took owning a house in the &#x27;burbs to remember how much I didn&#x27;t like the cookie-cutter aspect.  Doubly so for the fact that virtually every suburban neighborhood built in the past 20 years has an HOA, which I detest.<p>- The distance.  Going to <i>anything</i>, even just a Wal-Mart to get groceries, meant a minimum of 10 minutes just to get out of the &quot;residential area&quot; and make it to the &quot;commercial area.&quot;  The one corner store we had was usually under pressure from the city government and nearby residents to close down because of, allegedly, too much traffic.<p>- Minimal cultural differences.  Yes, my hometown had a Western Days Weekend and an Old Town District but that was it.  The town where I bought my first house (this was a bad idea, in retrospect) didn&#x27;t even bother with that.  Everything else in both places was strip shopping centers or Wal-Mart or paved six-lane roadways to get people out of town to the big city for work and then back into town to get to sleep at night.  Going to do anything, like a zoo or museum or a baseball game, meant a half-hour minimum drive.  There are lots of suburbs in north Texas, let&#x27;s say, that exist solely for zoning authority.<p>You mentioned being outside and being kids.  The city where I live now, Seattle, has a massive parks system.  My tiny house on a tiny lot in the city still has about 1,600sqft of outdoor area to play in and a huge tree.  Even the apartments we&#x27;ve rented have a courtyard and are near to parks and sidewalks and places to play.  It&#x27;s great for people whose kids are outdoor types; mine prefers to be inside with books and puzzles and computers.<p>What I like about raising our kid in the city: Exposure to new and different ideas; most cities aren&#x27;t self-selected to be the same as each other.  A varying cityscape that isn&#x27;t just the same houses feeding to the same street and to the same businesses.  More cultural and entertainment options are close at hand.  Being able to live in a more environmentally sensitive way (my kid doesn&#x27;t want to learn how to drive and prefers to take transit and has made compost and recycle separating into a game).",1454882388

Used correctly its safe as a surgery scalpel.<p>They insist on mixing technologies that are very problematic for the general untrained public to mix, like water and electricity, as either victim or employee.<p>There can be disease issues, not quite of the level of a biohazard lab, but you want at least some minimal standards and of course some of the chemicals used for sterilization are not necessarily safe for the general public to screw around with as either victim or employee.<p>This was a &quot;local news issue&quot; a couple years ago where the big bad state was attacking &quot;retired beauticians cutting hair in their basement part time&quot; but they carefully don&#x27;t mention its more than cutting hair, there are open containers of high strength hydrogen peroxide in a residential house with kids in it, or the hair dryer not plugged into a GFCI outlet next to the running water sink, etc.<p>WRT danger and risk its about one or two steps beneath the truck driver with a CDL and hazmat cert, or the electrician who does the wiring for a public pool, or the welder at the local nuclear plant... and the hoops to jump thru are also, appropriately, about one or two steps lower.  From a high risk down view as opposed to low risk looking up, its not unreasonable.<p>If you propose separation of the harmless hair cutting stuff from dangerous stuff, then the tear jerking starts about problems of scale and unless there is a level playing field of identical training only giant salons will be able to afford the specialized and soon to be rare training to color hair or whatever.<p>It makes a great straw dog, but is a pretty good match compared to other fields.",1454882321

Across the country we are working to replace leaded pipes when we can, but the problem is very complex. As it turns out, it&#x27;s much more cost-effective to treat water than embark upon giant infrastructure projects. Simply put, the MDEQ, and the EPA should have known to treat the water, which would have kept the lead from leeching into the water. Unfortunately, this wasn&#x27;t done, and now the pipes are damaged - perhaps beyond repair.<p>Despite the above, the water problems in Flint can&#x27;t be attributed to a single thing, but rather a culmination of failures in state and local government best described as a problem of culture.

My main computer is a laptop running Linux and the Orca screen reader, but I&#x27;ve used Windows and NVDA before. I&#x27;ve had multiple Android phones/tablets and have used IOS. Last decade I used OS X heavily but transitioned away after a few years. Most devices have some level of accessibility built-in these days, so there isn&#x27;t one single thing I&#x27;d use, just as a sighted person might use a laptop/desktop at their desk, a phone on the go, etc.<p>What do I do for work?: Again, probably the same as many here. I&#x27;ve done contract development on Android and the web, and am currently launching my own company. Nothing surprising or different.<p>What technology interests me?: I guess it depends on the day. :) I&#x27;m a web and mobile developer so tend to be more up on things like React, React Native, etc. I particularly enjoy working with mobile tech because there are lots of ways in which a mobile device with camera/GPS/lots of processing power/numerous connectivity options can tell me things about my world given the right apps and services. 8 years ago, running an errand meant I grabbed my phone, MP3 player, bluetooth GPS receiver and the PDA to which the receiver paired that ran accessible mapping software. Now I just grab my phone and it&#x27;s much more capable on its own, handling GPS, OCR for reading documents, etc. I think there are a number of ways mobile tech can improve how we interact with our world, and I&#x27;m starting companies to explore those.",1454880506

Everything now seems to require a closure or some &quot;.into()&quot; idiom. Like this:<p><pre><code>     let file: Box<Read> = match fname {\n            &quot;-&quot; => Box::new(stdin.lock()),\n             _  => Box::new(fs::File::open(fname).unwrap_or_else(|err| {\n                     writeln!(io::stderr(), &quot;{}: \&quot;{}\&quot;&quot;, err, fname).unwrap();\n                     process::exit(1);\n                 }))\n        };\n</code></pre>\nType Result has its very own set of control flow primitives.[1] So does type Option.[2] Any type can have its very own flow control primitives. Are we going to see<p><pre><code>    date.if_weekday(|day| { ... }) \n</code></pre>\nand similar cruft for every type?  I hope not.<p>Hopefully the setup of closures that probably won&#x27;t be executed isnt&#x27;t too expensive. Do those require a heap allocation and release when not used, or is this all on the stack?  The run time variation for small changes indicates that some constructs are more expensive than others, but it&#x27;s hard to know which ones are bad.<p>I understand the rationale behind the Rust approach to error handling, but it&#x27;s just painful to look at.  After seeing the gyrations people go through in Go and Rust to deal with the lack of exceptions, it looks like leaving exceptions does not make a language simpler.  From a compiler perspective, the compiler can generally assume that exceptions are the rare case, and can optimize accordingly.

My observations (as a former postdoc in biomedical research) were:<p>Reviewers get no pay or remuneration, pauce guidelines, and no training (which is where articles like this can make a difference). There are no tangible career benefits for doing it (other than &#x27;everyone else does it&#x27;), because you won&#x27;t get any sort of official record for papers that you&#x27;ve reviewed. (And because it&#x27;s single-blind, you&#x27;ll never be credited on the paper.) There&#x27;s very little feedback or quality control on reviews exerted by editors. You can&#x27;t ever discuss the paper with your fellow reviewer(s). And it&#x27;s an enormous time sink - reviewing a paper properly takes at least two hours, depending on the length and complexity. This is a real issue when you&#x27;re in a field where doing lab research, writing your own grants and papers, reading the latest literature to keep up-to-date with the field, and possibly doing some teaching or admin, already takes up most of your time.<p>It&#x27;s a seriously broken system. I inherently like the idea of doing reviews because it feels like you&#x27;re giving back something to the community, but it ended up feeling like this good will was being taken advantage of by the journals, particularly the for-profit ones.

Anytime someone complains about the license for this or that project being too permissive, it&#x27;s ironic because:<p>(a) it&#x27;s someone trying to force their values on someone else in the name of &quot;freedom&quot; (in scare quotes because it&#x27;s a very specific definition of the term that requires political buy-in to even see it as a form of freedom)<p>and<p>(b) as stated, the people complaining are free (no scare quotes) to take the permissively licensed code and incorporate it into their &quot;free&quot; code to their heart&#x27;s content. The ability to do this is one of the reasons people choose permissive licenses in the first place.<p>I don&#x27;t care if people choose freedom or &quot;freedom&quot; or anything in between- that&#x27;s their right as authors, and no one license is appropriate for all communities or goals or projects. I only object to anyone who claims that there is a One True Path that everyone should follow and that anyone who doesn&#x27;t follow that path is somehow morally inferior, which is usually the template that these discussions follow.",1454879361

It used to be possible to buy a pro-quality film camera and prime lens for less than $1,000 -- so, let&#x27;s say $1500 in today&#x27;s dollars. More money might get you features like better auto-exposure, auto-focus or high-speed film winders, but a lot of pros didn&#x27;t use any of those features, and back in the day when I was shooting sports events at my college, I often had a more modern camera rig than the pros sitting next to me. Digital cameras that give similar image quality as those film cameras start at $2,500 today, and go up from there. It feels like the divide between pro and amateur equipment in photography has shot through the roof over the past decade, with the blanket adoption of digital.<p>What has gotten cheaper / more accessible is the ability to publicize, duplicate and distribute one&#x27;s work. Twenty years ago, short of dropping off prints at the local newspaper, there would be no way for an amateur photographer to get her photos under the nose of photo editors at major news outlets. Today, that&#x27;s as simple as uploading to Flickr.",1454878968

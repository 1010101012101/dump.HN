It should be noted that appellate practice, which is really where the big debates about legal interpretation happen, the &quot;what does this comma mean&quot; work, is not exactly a cash cow for the industry. It&#x27;s a brand-building practice, but outside boutiques it&#x27;s not what pays the rent.

6136446,comment,6134424,6135643,1,0,rossjudson,,,"JVM != GC, although it is one of the best implementations out there.<p>Rock-solid FPS doesn&#x27;t preclude GC. What it requires is a separate rendering layer that isn&#x27;t subject to any GC pauses (or a game-like rendering loop that&#x27;s always on time). The managed code manipulates the declarative level of the animations, and the low level handles the frame-by-frame details.<p>On relatively small heap sizes (under a GB) GC on recent PC hardware usually fits into the equivalent of a single frame -- under 30 milliseconds. Concurrent collectors would rarely need anything more than that, and wouldn&#x27;t stop the world in any case.<p>The question here is, can you build a stable high performance rendering system on the JVM? If not, what would you have to change to be able to do that?<p>Correctly constructed you wouldn&#x27;t have to change much. And JMonkeyEngine shows you can do a lot with what&#x27;s there right now.

6136433,comment,6129148,6133697,1,0,RogerL,,,"Thanks for the link.<p>I have the exact opposite reaction to the video. He is solving toy problems with toy ideas. I think his page Kill Math (<a href=""http://worrydream.com/KillMath/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://worrydream.com/KillMath/</a>) illuminates this point. I don&#x27;t think he can think symbolically very well (no insult intended, I can&#x27;t think visually very well). There are certainly times where graphing things make a lot of sense, but to throw out analytical math? Come on. By and large he is getting the &quot;feel&quot; of a system, but he cannot really reason about it, prove things about it, extend it, or design new systems with vision (there are obvious counterexamples).<p>In another video he shows an IDE where he scrubs constants, and it changes the behavior of the concurrently running program (changing the size of an ellipse or tree branch). It&#x27;s neat. But, again, toy problem. First of all, we shouldn&#x27;t be programming with constants. Second, anything complicated will have relationships between the data - scrubbing one value will just end up giving you nonsense. Third, it just doesn&#x27;t make any sense in many contexts. I work in computer vision currently, and I can&#x27;t think of anything but the most superficial way I could incorporate scrubbing. He made some comment about how no one could know what a bezier curve is unless they had a nice little picture of it in their IDE to match the function call. That&#x27;s silly. I actually use splines and other curve fitting in my work, and I have to actually understand the math. Do I use cubic splines, a Hermite interpolation, bezier, or something else? I don&#x27;t decide that by drawing some pictures - the search space is too big, I&#x27;ll never cover all the possibilities. I have to do math to figure out the best choice.<p>In that same video he went on to demonstrate programming binary search using visual techniques. Unfortunately he wrote a buggy implementation, and stood there exclaiming how his visual technique found a different bug. It did, a super trivial one, but it completely failed to reveal the deeper issue. And, there was no real way for his visual method to have found it.<p>Visualization is an very powerful tool, but it is one tool in the toolchest. There is a scene in the movie Contact with Jodie Foster using headphones to listen to the SETI signal. We all know that is bogus - the search space is far too vast for aural search to work.<p>His ideas are terribly wrong headed. Make interfaces to help give us intuition? Absolutely! Use graphics where analytics fail. Of course! But don&#x27;t conclude that math is a &quot;freakish knack&quot;, as he does, or that math is some sort of temple (he calls mathematicians &quot;clergy&quot;, and then goes on to throw in an insult that many are just pretending to understand).<p>I posted in another comment how crazy it would be to have a calculator that scrubs. Well, he shows one on that page. Really?  The day bridge designers start using scrubbing apps to design our bridges is the day I&#x27;m never crossing a bridge again.<p>Edit to add: his website is another example of this. I can&#x27;t find anything on it. There are a bunch of pictures, and my eyes saccade around, but what is here, what is his point? I dunno. I can click, and click, and click, and start to get an idea, but there is always more hidden away behind pictures. It&#x27;s barely workable as a personal website, and would be a disaster as a way to organize anything larger. I don&#x27;t mean to pick on it - as an art project or glimpse into how he thinks, it&#x27;s great. I just point out it illustrates (pun kind of intended) the strengths and limits of visual presentation. You tell me, for example, without grep or google search, whether he has written about coffee.<p>If you disagree, please reply in pictures only! ;)",1375300502

He&#x27;s a spy chief in the truest sense <i>and</i> a master politician. Anyone who thinks he walked into that conference hall in Caesars without a near perfect forecast of the outcome of the speech is kidding themselves.<p>Heckling Alexander played right into the strategy. It gave him an opportunity to look reasonable compared to his detractors, and, more generally (and alarmingly), to have the NSA look more reasonable compared to opponents of NSA surveillance. It allowed him to &quot;split the vote&quot; with audience reactions, getting people who probably have serious misgivings about NSA programs to applaud his calm and graceful handling of shouted insults; many of those people probably applauded simply to protest the hecklers, who after all were making it harder for them to follow what Alexander was trying to say.<p>There was no serious Q&A on offer at the keynote. The questions were pre-screened; all attendees could do was vote on them. There was no possibility that anything would come of this speech other than an effectively unchallenged full-throated defense of the NSA&#x27;s programs.<p>Even the premise of the keynote was calculated to wrong-foot NSA opponents. However much you might want to hear Alexander account for the activities of the NSA, the NSA itself is not the real oversight mechanism for the NSA! My guess is that no pol with meaningful oversight over NSA would have consented to address a room full of technology professionals about NSA&#x27;s programs; they were happy to send NSA&#x27;s own supremely well-trained figurehead to do that for them.<p>I think a walkout might have been effective, had it been organized well enough in advance (perhaps with some of the same aplomb as the [I think misguided] opposition to CISPA); at least you&#x27;d get some stinging photos.",1375299641

Adding sigils makes it quite clear:<p>my $W = qq_mult $ConjugateQ, qv_mult $RotationQ, $Vector;<p>Further, most languages have only one type of variable, a name for a single thing. Perl has multiple types of variables that behave differently. For example:<p>my $res = munge $one;<p>I see this and know that the function munge is passed one single variable. However, consider this:<p>my $res = munge @two;<p>If there wasn&#x27;t the @ there, it would be easy to assume that munge gets exactly one argument. However the @ there alerts us to the fact that @two is an auto-flattening array, and munge will end up with anywhere between 0 and MAX_INT arguments passed to it.<p>Similarly with hashes:<p>my $res = munge @two;<p>They also auto-flatten, so they need to be marked as being different from scalars, but they also flatten in a very different way from array, in that they flatten into a list that alternates the keys and values. So they need to be marked differently from arrays.<p>Lastly, due to functions, variables, array and hashes having explicit sigils, they can be recognized by editors without any heavy analysis, enabling editors to mark these four types with different colors, which is extremely useful. Personally i don&#x27;t see the sigils anymore, and instead just see the colors with which the types are highlighted.<p>(Bonus set: Actually C is often written with sigils too. I&#x27;ve often seen code where variables are prefixes with p_, s_, a_, i_, etc. They are not enforced by the language, but people often force themselves to use them.

A friend sent you a private FB message, you can an email notification with the content in line (even with the support of replying to message via email as well).<p>Now, because email traffic on the internet is not encrypted by default, one is able to piece together the contents of communications just by looking at the email.<p>Essentially anything that you receive via email (e.g. password reset links; credit card statement summaries etc) is subject to capture and analysis.

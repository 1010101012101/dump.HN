839597,comment,839447,839447,0,0,electromagnetic,,,"Summary: Shaky 1983 experiment that is grossly misquoted as proving the absence of freewill is challenged by a 2008 experiment with results that don't outright contradict the 1983 but apparently manage to disprove the falsely attributed claims with new falsely attributed claims!<p>It's hooey on top of hooey basically. From what I can tell by reading up on Libet's work (the 1983 guy) is that he established that when we're anticipating an action (in the experiments case it was pushing a button, but could for instance be catching a ball or anything) our brain is aware of it's decision ~2 seconds before the person actually states they've made the decision, when the action is in the pre-frontal cortex it can apparently be up to 10 seconds. <i>However</i> our consciousness can kick in to stop the action.<p>Libet's research doesn't claim we lack free will, it's actually evidence of the delay our consciousness receives compared to our subconscious. It's been shown that our subconscious will pick up on a pattern three-times faster than our conscious; one example of this was a card game where a player was rewarded for turning over a black-card and punished for a red-card, it took the subconscious 5 cards before it started anticipating the results where as it took roughly 18 cards before the actual player announced the pattern (IIRC this wasn't a timed experiment, the cards were dealt as fast as the human player wanted).<p>I wouldn't say any of these experiments show a lack of free will, I'd say it gives proof of the incredibly complex machine that our brains are and that our consciousness is actually an evolutionary advancement to conserve energy. Libet showed that our consciousness has a veto over an anticipatory action, our biggest anticipatory actions are <i>fight</i> and <i>flight</i> both of which consume massive amounts of energy that if we used every time they were called upon would be wasteful.",1253724459

If you really make this visa contingent on funding, then in addition to having the power of the purse, the VC will have the power of immigration.<p>One solution, of course, is to make it independent of funding, but then distinguishing between ""founders"" and ""people who want to move to the US and might one day start a company"" gets pretty hard, policy-wise.  Now, I have no particular aversion to the latter group either, but plenty of Americans apparently do.<p>The real answer, as many have suggested, is to fix immigration policy rather than carving out exceptions for our preferred niche.<p>Edit: found original blog post referenced above - <a href=""http://kirkwylie.blogspot.com/2009/09/founder-visa-ignores-immigration.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://kirkwylie.blogspot.com/2009/09/founder-visa-ignores-i...</a>",1253724385

I guess the major problem that's always been there with this kinda stuff in the past is that its just so inconvenient. But having it integrated directly into the browser (by default?) kind of axes that qualm -- plus the whole ""age of twitter"" thing, with our growing habit of blasting updates back and forth about your every moment helps a lot. Allowing your friends to easily join in the conversation can really help you feel like you aren't just shouting into the abyss.<p>The only thing that I still question whenever I see this stuff (including one of my own projects, so maybe I'm biased), is whether or not it meshes with the way we really communicate, and if it fits with the way we'd best want to leave our marks when annotating the web.<p>I mean, its obvious that we'd want to be able to see what's out there in the universe of all available conversations for what we're looking at, but does that mean its best to keep them all in a single stream, which is what it looks like sidewiki wants? And moreover, does that really just boil down into a triviality in implementation details? Or is it something more? Do we need to start re-examining the nature of how we comment? Maybe the single page collection idea works well for blogs and stuff like that because we're more or less being co-ordinated by the original author (and the conversation that grows out of the seed they planted), but when we start annotating, we aren't necessarily going to be discussing things in nearly the same frame as the meme generated by a page at large.<p>Maybe I don't want to talk about missiles on a link dedicated missiles. Maybe there was something in the article that sparked off something tangental (I can't spell, or even tell if that's a real word, sorry) about transportation, or energy, or something that would just be lost if I just let it drip into the chaotic conversation that 4chan drove towards jihad on its sidewiki page. The ""implementation detail"" way of resolving the issue is just to silo up conversations, but still allow people to find the common root that links them all together, so you don't always start at zero. And that's fine, a page can very easily have a 1-N relationship with its impending streams of thought, just like bit.ly lets links have 1-N shortlinks that pad our individual egos, but still tracks the traffic generated to the destination in aggregate.<p>But what about N-1? N-N? Things start getting really interesting. To me, its interesting on the scale of pagerank.",1253723054

7312467,comment,7311297,7311297,9,0,anupshinde,,,"Thanks everybody for such an amazing response and suggestions.<p>Few people asked  what I changed that caused this sudden change in incoming leads.<p>I do not know what exactly worked - but here are few things I changed.<p>1. It may be the calendar - but my intuition says its not just that.<p>2. Made my profile more keyword specific instead of lots of text. Uploaded a picture. \nI also researched a lot on other successful Elance profiles. There were two categories there \n\ta) Sounds cool to other freelancers, developers - I switched from this to the one below:\n\tb) Well formatted, keyword rich (for humans too) and shows up better in search results and shows up important stuff in the shorter profile views.<p>3. Removed the hourly rate from my profile. I did not charge much lower later either. But I figured out that fighting for that $1 extra is not worth if I am going to lose a lead and spend more time looking for other work. I think 49 < 50 should be represented as 49 <<<<< 50 (These are not my actual hourly rates). This may have been a biggest problem in getting invites.<p>4. Changed my profile such that it is more focused to what I want to do and passionate about (data-science/machine learning) rather than what I am good at (web-development). This doesn&#x27;t really seem to have any impact on the kind of work I get - I get both equally. This has more due to my personal choice - I did not want to do web-development at my day job and at freelancing  (it kind of gets boring)<p>5. Updated my blog with one pending post I had created earlier but had been lazy to upload it.<p>---<p>6. Reduced a lot of self-pitching in the proposals. I carefully choose whom I write proposal to. Client history, Previous hiring rate/cost, Client&#x27;s project award ratio, understanding of technology, understanding of requirements, timeline suggested. I tend to focus on leads who seem to have a lesser understanding of technology but better clarity on requirements.<p>7. Chances of getting selected when somebody invites you are far greater than competing with 50 or 100 proposals. If you are invited - it seems that you are more likely to get work at your preferred rates.<p>8. Placing bids when the requirement is fresh and new (or has less proposals). Chances are that in case of lower proposals, client has received many proposals like &quot;I can do in it $XXXX&quot;. A good proposal with relevant questions tends to stand out. If something has more than 12-15 proposals with rated freelancers - I back out unless I think I can make a very strong proposal or if this project is a &quot;must-try&quot;. There may be tempting high value projects 3 days old with 80 proposals - chances are that the client has started discussing with somebody else in those 3 days. I used to spend a lot of time on such postings, and almost immediately discard those nowadays.",1393512953

If you can&#x27;t find any competitors, there&#x27;s likely not enough people willing to pony up the cash for such a product.<p>I like to find existing markets, not try to create new ones.<p>Where to check if people have this itch that needs scratching:<p>Amazon\nGoogle Keyword Tool\nExample: if you&#x27;re writing an ebook, check if someone&#x27;s selling something similar on Amazon. Is it fairly popular? Check the reviews. Are people clamoring for something the book didn&#x27;t address?<p>Process:<p>1. Figure out what the exact value proposition is.<p>Your proposition should be an equation of cost vs. benefits that results in the motivation of your prospect to buy.<p>Motivation to buy = Perceived benefits - Perceived costs<p>Your success depends on creating perceived benefits higher than what it costs the end user.<p>You need to put yourself in the customer&#x27;s shoes and keep asking yourself: What&#x27;s in it for me?<p>&quot;Our product is designed nicer...&quot; No! What&#x27;s in it for me?<p>&quot;Our product is faster...&quot; No! What&#x27;s in it for me?<p>&quot;Our product is easier to use...&quot; No! What&#x27;s in it for me?<p>&quot;Our product makes your content accessible across every device you own&quot;... Okay good, now we&#x27;re getting somewhere.<p>2. Create a landing page.<p>Use a tool like Instapage, LeadSquared, GumRoad or even Google Docs to create a quick, dirty landing page to test out your value proposition. It should have a form to collect emails. Don&#x27;t let your OCD kick in at this stage with regards to the design.<p>3. Get 10 people to show interest.<p>I prefer not to sell to my own contacts for digital products because I feel they will sign up to be notified just because we&#x27;re friends. Instead, I tap into online communities where my target audience is. Reddit, Facebook Groups, Forums, LinkedIn etc.<p>Don&#x27;t spam the communities -- be genuine and state you&#x27;re building this product and giving a discount to the early adopters.<p>If you can get 10 people to show interest, this idea is worth exploring further.<p>Part 2: Physical products<p>Preliminary:<p>Step 1: Amazon is a goldmine to do research for a physical product. Find your competitors and read the reviews.<p>Make a list of things people don&#x27;t like about your competitor&#x27;s product.<p>Step 2: We need to check if it&#x27;s going to be easy to acquire customers in a cost effective manner. Lets head over to Google Keyword Tool.<p>Check what the average CPC is for what you&#x27;re trying to sell. This will help you price your product as well. Using the CPC and the average conversion rate in the segment, you can gain insight into how to price your product.<p>Process:<p>1. Make a quick mockup of the product.<p>We aren&#x27;t actually going to be shipping something in the validation phase, so just creating a mockup is good enough.<p>2. Setup a landing page with Shopify.<p>We&#x27;re going to try and get people to pay us for real. So use a template and create a quick site on Shopify. Alternatively, you could also just try and get people to Paypal you if you want to keep it really simple. I prefer Shopify.<p>3.a Find 5 people willing to pay you in your network.<p>For physical products, I like to tap into any and all of my contacts and their networks by just email at first. See if you can get 5 people willing to pony up.<p>If you can&#x27;t your own contacts to buy your physical product (and they fit your target audience), it&#x27;s not a good sign.<p>By now you must be saying &quot;ummm, but I don&#x27;t have the product to sell yet&quot;.<p>That&#x27;s fine. We&#x27;re not actually going to be keeping their money. You can either refund their money back or if you get a great response, tell them you&#x27;re back-ordered and get the product quickly made and shipped.<p>3.b Find 5 people willing to pay you that are not in your network.<p>Use free AdWords credits to drive traffic to the landing page / Shopify site. Pick targeted keywords to get an objective view of demand.<p>You can apply this validation approach to a service based business as well. Instead of Amazon, you can use Craigslist to test out demand for your service.",1393512037

This is an industry that cannot even follow their own watered-down initiatives like DoNotTrack.<p>And because ad networks use layers of affiliates, sites typically have no visibility nor control over what their visitors are being served. That&#x27;s why you end up with a marketing company like Evidon buying Ghostery - just so they can help companies monitor the garbage on their own pages![3]<p>And to top it off, ads are now a common attack vector for viruses and malware that not even the big companies can control:<p>1. Just last week, Youtube was serving banking malware via its online ads. [1]<p>2. Last month Yahoo got a lot of attention serving Bitcoin malware via online ads on their site.

Austrians and people living in Austria are facing legal consequences for such actions only if this kind of marriage occurs within the country’s borders. From January 2012 the Federal Government has amended the anti-forced marriage law to allow prosecutors to press charges against perpetrators over forced marriages abroad.<p>In Belgium: &quot;Forcing someone to marry is a criminal offence.&quot;<p>In Cyprus: &quot;Forcing someone to marry is a criminal offence.&quot;<p>In Denmark: &quot;The Danish Criminal Code includes an offence of unlawful coercion, prohibiting the use of threats by a person to force another person to do something against their will. This offence would apply to marriage if threats were used to force a person into marriage against their will. The penalty for this offence ranges from a fine to a period of imprisonment not exceeding two years.&quot;<p>In Germany: &quot;Forcing someone to marry is a distinct criminal offence and can be punished by up to five years in \nprison. The law also gives non-German citizens who are forced by their husbands/families to leave the country after their marriage a legal right to return to Germany. &quot;<p>I don&#x27;t know what I&#x27;d do in this situation — I&#x27;m not even sure I can understand what it&#x27;s like.

When I&#x27;m writing this post, I hope that those reading it will become in some way more mentally accepting of my point of view. But I think we don&#x27;t look enough at how susceptible we are to advertising, and how much advertising depends on exploiting cognitive biases or implying untruths that are not explicitly stated.<p>We (humans) are really bad at not being affected by advertising, even if we know we&#x27;re being advertised to, and even if we know the ad is deceptive. When sites depend on ad revenue, they&#x27;re saying &quot;We&#x27;re offering this content for free, but in exchange we want to be able to bias/prime your brain so that when you see Product X, even far in the future, you are more likely to desire it.&quot; That&#x27;s a very powerful thing, and while it&#x27;s certainly necessary for many business models today, I think we should think of this as a &quot;necessary evil.&quot;<p>There are sites where I disable ad-blocking, often in response to a genuine plea on the part of the website. If it&#x27;s a site I particularly care about and feel that I trust, then I allow ads as a way of helping them out. But if ad-blocking is piracy, then ads themselves are brainwashing -- exploiting failings in human cognition to unconsciously guide people into actions or purchases that may or may not be optimal for them -- and with the subject having limited defenses against it once infected.",1393510802

I moved to the bay in 2004, and I was able to comfortably afford a few decent apartments in mountain view/sunnyvale. Those apartments have gone up by 200% in their price because of proximity to FB, Google and other firms.<p>Everything will continue to get more and more expensive as the cost of basic services goes up and up - eventually you'll start losing a lot of good creative people because nobody can afford to take an entry level job and work their way up. The bar for living ""comfortably"" in the bay area has been rising extremely fast, and those who have bought a home 20 years ago can live fine, but for young people especially it will be really difficult to catch up.

We were building a Google Maps app for a branch of the UN and my boss told me we needed to hide the map's boundaries and use the ones supplied by the UN. I was rather intrigued and he explained how the boundaries used by Google sometimes clashed with the UN's recognition of boundaries for some countries. So I went and loaded the KML using the UN-official boundaries.<p>Of course, I see some were quick to jump the ""Google is taking too much power"" bandwagon, but a story is not just on HN to be told but also to engage our minds to reflect. And to me, the story here seems to be about digital recognition of countries beginning to be almost on par with international recognition, and how the digital world, that we thought (hoped?) would abolish the frontiers between men, is still taking these frontiers in account.",1367614587

The contest was down to NeXTStep, with Steve Jobs, or BeOS, with Jean-Louis Gassee. As I understand it, the BeOS folks held out for too much money (Apple was much closer to broke than they realized) while Jobs settled for power. All else is history.<p>If Apple's successive post-Jobs CEOs (Sculley and Amelio) hadn't maneuvered the behemoth into a blind alley, NeXT would indeed  have faded eventually. But with full access to Apple's resources, the NeXT team were able to turn things around. Sitting on the top shelf in my office, gathering dust (I turn it on every couple of years) there's a cube. A nice shiny <i>silver</i> cube that runs something that looks eerily like NeXTStep, if you squint at it, with a classic MacOS emulation bag on the side.

I think his point was that you shouldn't spend <i>all</i> of you time networking with other startup people.  And that's a sentiment that I wholeheartedly agree with.<p>Unless you are selling to startups as your market, you have to get out of the startup echo chamber at some point, and get out in the trenches where your customers live, and talk to them.  If you're selling to manufacturers, instead of going to the nth ""startup happy hour"" even of the week, how about go the ""National Manufacturers Association"" trade show or whatever?<p>On a related note, we should look at our social media activity and ask who our audience is... the HN crowd, and other startups, or customers?  Personally, this is something I've just forced myself to start looking at differently in the past 2 weeks or so.  I've cut back on tweeting tweets about startups and VC and Silicon Valley gossip, and started tweeting stuff that's, ya know, of interest to the people I want to <i>sell</i> to.   It's a seemingly subtle change, but in just two weeks we already have dozens of new followers who represent our potential customer base.  That's ""permission marketing"" at work, and it's something I wish I'd realized a lot sooner.<p>Anyway, I think the OP is onto something.  No, don't take <i>anything</i> as an absolute... and go to the ""startup happy hour"" from time to time, sure.

But learning from smart people is something that happens almost by osmosis if you mix with a good selection of other startups.<p>Being around when one startup falters and the founders and team are looking to join something interesting means your network for recruiting grows, and some of the best team mates I've had have been when one startup died and folks joined up for another.  That's accelerating growth.<p>Seeing what mistakes others are making prevents you from making and short cuts the path to making the right choices.  That's accelerating growth.<p>If you've got a crappy product and an idea that isn't going to work, and you spend yourself hanging out with others similar to you in that, well, you're not going to do anyone any good.  Particularly not when, as I've seen, it becomes a complaint fest about the industry not an analysis of what you could be doing better.  Like anyone who's ever worked at a big company will tell you, if you hang outside the building with the smokers bitching about the company, don't be surprised if you aren't the ones doing well at that company.<p>So YMMV, but absolutely mix with other startups.

The cooled product is very hard.""<p>Yeah, my friend and I finely ground up a HUGE batch of that aluminum and sulfer in a mortar and lit it in the fume hood.  It looked like a rocket was going off.  What we also didn't realize was that the product, aluminum sulfide, should NOT go in water, and water is exactly where I dumped the stuff.  It stunk up the lab with hydrogen sulfide.  I wonder how many brain cells I killed with that.<p>- Burned some chromium compound.  Can't remember what it was, but when I showed the instructor the product, he got really upset.  He began scooping it out of the sink because apparently I'd created a carcinogen.<p>- Found a container of mercuric (II) nitrate.  It was the one thing the instructor wouldn't let us play with.<p>That was all in high school.  Mostly in the fume hood.  College was a lot more boring (we had to wear goggles and gloves to handle Kool-aid), although I did accidentally spill a container of concentrated sulfuric acid all over the place in organic synth lab.",1367613894

It's not likely to be a blockbuster consumer product this year or maybe not next year but moving displays next to our eyeballs is a natural next step and putting cameras on headsets is a natural next step.  I'm hugely skeptical whether those steps need to happen together.<p>I'd guess the killer app for next gen mobile headsets is the ability to record your surroundings.  Yes you can do that with a phone today.  What you can't do is have your phone in your pocket constantly holding 5-15+ seconds of audio and video so that when you hit record you get the thing you actually wanted to record whether it's something adorable your kid/pet did, a great joke, an illegal act etc.<p>So that's the killer app imho and it's going to require an insane amount of battery life up front (and we're putting it right next to people's brains so it better not catch fire or blow up).  Then we'll probably need an insane amount of mobile bandwidth and cloud storage for persistent streaming.<p>But wait we're jumping ahead, you don't need an eye display to do this, you get the functionality from just a camera on a bluetooth headset while the slab in your pocket handles the storage/radios.  In fact powering a display is going to kill overall battery life which is the most important constraint.

This is just how we'd like to use mail in the future if we're lucky enough to have your support to be around that long.<p>- Multiple accounts: You have a username/password to your account that has access to all your mailboxes. Mailboxes themselves don't have any username/password combo. Owner of a domain can give you an access to a mailbox. We're using SMS to verify you and is used again in case of a lost password. To have a better control over access on a different devices it's a nice idea to disable some mailboxes from mobile devices. We'll look into it. Messages will be encrypted and communicate with your devices only over HTTPS. We're taking security very seriously and we're enhancing all of this all the time even for the beta to be absolutely safe.<p>- Social media: Honestly, we don't have any plans to make this optional to be displayed.<p>- Metadata: Don't worry, I myself need those basic information at hand. The app as it's getting developed changes a bit from design screenshots but not so much it makes it overwhelming.

Houston has no zoning, and yet is completely sprawling and full of contractually agreed development restrictions, which are not zoning and do not involve a government but produce the same effect.<p>Say you're buying a nice suburban house in Houston. It has no zoning, so you're worried your neighbors might sometime in the future replace their house with a loud bar, or a factory, or subdivide it into rental housing. An enterprising subdivision developer realizes they can get more money if they can assure you that none of these things will happen. So when they're building the subdivision, they don't just sell you the property unrestricted. Instead, they draw up a set of rules governing future use of the property, and they require anyone who buys a house in the subdivision to sign a contract agreement to be bound by them. Now they can promise you that your neighbor won't build a factory on their land, because the subdivision rules don't permit it, and your neighbor has signed a contract agreeing to the rules.<p>The rules you agree to typically along the lines of what you'd normally get from suburban, Palo-Alto-style zoning regulations: you agree not to subdivide the property, not to redevelop it into anything other than a 1- or 2-story single-family house, not to build a structure on the property that doesn't meet certain design and land-occupation percentage requirements, not to operate an industrial or commercial facility on the property, in some cases not to rent it to tenants, etc., etc.<p>In short, the market demands and produces zoning.",1367612911

Here is my reasoning:<p>The genius of gradients and shadows in design is that they allow for objects to appear 3D, that is, they can visually ""pop"" off the flat page and therefore draw the users' attention to them. This is good unless every element on the page has shadows and gradients, then it becomes very pretty but very distracting.<p>When I'm on a website, I'm not appreciating a colorful Monet, I'm trying to <i>always</i> do <i>essentially</i> one of two things: Find the right thing to click so that I no longer need to be on that website, or else read text. (or look at photos, etc.) Being a pretty site is a huge plus, but not if it distracts from one of those two goals.<p>The genius of Flat UI that has recently (re-)exploded in popularity is not to draw attention to specific elements, but to ease the experience by doing the opposite: it <i>un-distracts</i> by removing all this popping stuff.<p>And I love Flat UI for this. I can see clearly now, the bevel and embossed rain is gone.<p>Alas these icons are about as distracting as you can get. Many of them resemble a <i>flat UI style</i>, but they've missed the point of Flat UI entirely. It's not that I dislike gradients, its that I don't want to be distracted in my journey to find the one button I need to click and then get off the page.<p>I understand that they're examples of what you could do, but I do hope hey're something no site author would <i>want</i> to do. No user ever has had the thought, ""Before I click a button, I really wish it would wabble back and forth.""<p>(And if I'm there to read text, I sure don't want anything animating while I'm reading!)<p>~~~<p>I don't mean to be totally harsh on animations. They can be useful when you need to create affordances. Buttons that highlight as you mouse-over them afford clicking, just like the visual of knobs (say on a car dash board) in real life afford turning. An icon that flies away as I hover over it, or significantly changes shape as I hover over it is probably not a good choice for nearly any button.",1367612383

So while you were correct to point out that <i>technically</i> the US public owns most of it, still 47% held by foreigner is so high that everything what I said in my post is still valid. We can't raise interest rates because this will result in funds going from the US to foreigners. Economic suicide. And we won't be able to keep them at zero too. I specifically used word foreigners and not China too.<p>Now, eight percent my seem not too much, <i>but</i> it is 16% of the foreign held debt. Let's say that China for purily political reasons decides to sell all the US debt they hold on a single day. When - as I said - the US Treasuries are valued at their 300 years high, so looks like a bubble, so temptation may be there anyway. I think all these central banks arounf the world sitting on the piles of the US Treasuries are just really, really worried at that point. It's like owning mortgages on plenty of houses back in 2007. If one of them can't take the pressure anymore and sells, everyone will, the bubble bursts. Plus China may have additional political agenda to do it (i.e. too may US bases around their country). This will crush prices, force rest of the foreigners to sell, making US Treasuries effectively worthless. Bam, the bubble bursted. Welcome to the world where the US dollar isn't the world reserve currency anymore.<p>Now, nothing to worry about. The US will be just fine after the default. As many other countries were fine after defaulting.<p>Look at the UK and why they quit Sues Canal in early 1950s. Because the US threatened them with open sale of all the UK bonds (guilds) we had. From this point on the UK empire is officially just en ""empire"". Because we got them by the balls. As China has us now.",1367611905

If you're being specifically targeted in an offline attack, that won't hold up. But in that very rare scenario, you are already in trouble. A 44-bit password will protect you from attackers trying to harvest from a big pool of stolen hashes, or from attackers bruteforcing the login form on a website. That is not the same thing as ""fake security through obscurity"".<p>As for the problem of strong, memorable passwords that can stand up to offline attacks, there is still a gap (a 253 bit password made of 11 bit words would be 23 words long), but I don't think the problem is unsolvable. A project I am interested in working on when I have time is one that produces very long, but memorable high-entropy passwords with rigorously quantified entropy by generating evocative, grammatically structured sentences, using a carefully selected word list and a set of mad-libs style templates.<p>So to get a ~256 bit pass phrase, you might be left to type out a 50 word poem. It would take <i>effort</i> to memorize, but it would be reasonably doable, whereas memorizing a random 39 character password is extremely difficult for most people.<p>Moreover, since you'd be working with a limited set of words and grammatical constructs, the password entry form could have robust auto-correction so that typos and spelling errors wouldn't be a significant problem.",1367611725

My takeaway was not ""Here are animated icons, you should litter all your pages with them"" but rather ""Here are animated icons, if you have a use case for them, then these are a very good option"".<p>For the too-much-animation commenters... Are you actually surprised that the demo page stuffs a lot of icons into a page in order to demonstrate the range of capabilities? See above -- the intent is that designers should use them sparingly and appropriately. Is animation necessary? Probably not. Can it be engaging if the execution is good? Without a doubt.<p>These are very nice-looking icons that appear to offer quite a bit of flexibility. I think that they will seem more natural in contexts where lightweight animations (drop shadows, spinners, etc.) are already used: alerting a user to an available interactive element, on hover as a user prepares to perform an action, during a wait period while processing occurs, or drawing attention to a completed action.<p>Many of these are pretty subtle or clever animations.

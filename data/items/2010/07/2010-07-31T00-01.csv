In some academic sense, an ideal programming system might have a kernel language that is probably rather small and certainly clean, flexible and extensible in its feature set, and then almost everything else built on top of that kernel in libraries. In practical programming systems, the perfect kernel has proven rather elusive, though.<p>It's rather like the question of whether a standard library should be small, clean and extensible or comprehensive with a good-enough version of everything. Many of us might be inclined toward the former approach from an academic/theoretical/intuitive point of view, but in practice, just about every widely used programming language from the past two decades has come with a batteries-included library. While those libraries are often criticised for various technical weaknesses, and many of those weaknesses are never addressed because it's too much work, these systems are still good enough for most users out of the box.",1280535907

1562959,comment,1561757,1562944,0,0,lispm,,,"No, bar is not a closure. It is basically just a local procedure.<p>The original Pascal did not have full closures. Functions did only exist as long as their surrounding function was called. They could not be returned from functions. Pascal lacked also the necessary Garbage Collection. Pascal had lexical scope, but not full closures.<p>All you could do was pass functions to other functions. But that's trivial, since each time one passed function X, it gets its active environment, which always is on the stack. There was no way to have closures, where functions have their own set of variable bindings, even when the surrounding function is no longer active. Being able to pass a function downwards is not sufficient to require full closures.<p>Basically the same applies for Algol. Functions can't be returned and are not first class objects.<p>What Algol contributed to the evolution of Lisp was lexical scope, but not closures. Also note that it was not Scheme that introduced closures in Lisp.<p>That's what I fear, many people think they know what a closure is, but in reality there is a lot of confusion.",1280535274

(as an aside, I'm considering that market again.  S3 is still here, and it's still pretty good, but it's prices are way higher now, relative to hardware and bandwidth costs, than they were then.)   I pivoted fairly quickly to FreeBSD chroot jails, which also didn't do so well, and then to Xen VPSs, which worked okay, though it took me another few years before I got the formula completely right.<p>The thing was, I blew through a significant amount of money (well, significant to me;  we're probably not talking about more than two porsches of consulting income)   but if I had used other people's money, they would have owned quite a lot of the company.   and other than my own experience and knowledge, the money spent before a pivot doesn't really help after a pivot.  (I mean, the experience and knowledge matter a lot, but bankruptcy court can't take that away)<p>Now, from my perspective (I own my company wholly; no investors, any company commitments and/or debit are co-signed by me personally)  unless I'm willing to declare personal bankruptcy, there isn't much difference between shutting down the company and starting a new every pivot, vs. keeping the company the same every pivot.    However, I did spend some significant money.    If I was using investor money,  wouldn't it make sense for me the founder to close the business  and start a new one, thus either retaining more equity or gaining more capital (if I got new investors)<p>I mean, obviously, if you do that from one very similar business to another, you are going to probably have legal problems, and at the very least damage your reputation amongst potential investors.<p>But, take for example, my first pivot.  Going from selling raw storage to selling shell accounts could reasonably be said to be a completely different business.  I don't think investors would blame me for failing to anticipate amazon would swoop in with a price point I couldn't beat, and I don't think they'd hold it against me if I decided to start another company later, selling chroot shell accounts.<p>How does that usually work?  what motivates the founder to stick with the existing investors when the business must 'pivot' to something unrelated to it's original intent?",1280535259

But more than maximizing the number of beers I receive, I am interested in giving it away to the site that is likely to emerge as the leader, and ideally begin the process of consolidating this ""business"". It's not large market, and too much segmentation is detrimental to innovation. A single, good place to find your co-founder would be great.<p>Adrian",1280535071

He just didn't make it do anything that would demonstrate it had to be a closure.<p>As for Pascal, you need to look again.  From the beginning Pascal had the ability to pass functions and procedures as parameters to other functions and procedures.  If those functions and procedures are defined in an inner scope, they will carry the original lexical scope, and are in fact full closures.  OK, they are clunky to use, but they work.  Skip to the end of the section starting at <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_Pascal_and_C#Functions.2Fprocedures"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_Pascal_and_C#Func...</a> to see the necessary syntax demonstrated.<p>Don't quote me on this, but I believe that Pascal was actually the very first language with full closures.  All of the necessary pieces are in ALGOL-68, but I think that Pascal was implemented first and so wins.<p>Incidentally Sussman claims that he got the idea of lexical scope for Scheme from studying ALGOL.  Of course Scheme realized the possibilities of the construct as no language before it had, and a lot of credit is due for that.  But you shouldn't lightly dismiss the contributions to Lisp from languages out of the Lisp family.",1280534572

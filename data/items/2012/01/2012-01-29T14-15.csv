3525317,comment,3523024,3524702,5,0,ams6110,,,"This is the same argument that was had about whether it was OK to make photocopies of content in books and magazines at the library, or record a radio broadcast or TV program.  I would agree with you that up to a point it is: the content is made available to or broadcast to the public, and that implies a certain license to personally do what you want with it once you receive it.  Hence copying or scanning printed material for later reference, time-shifting TV programs and sports events with DVR is generally and legally recognized as ""OK"" (I believe that ""fair use"" is the legal term here).<p>Likewise when you put your creative content on the internet, you are implicitly granting some license to people who view that content.  They can view the source, study your CSS and javascript, save it for offline viewing if they want.<p>But when you take someone else's content, be it a book, a TV broadcast or a web site design, copy it either completely or substantially, and then proceed to personally profit from that work without the permission of the creator, you've crossed the line.  Granted the distinction between copying (bad) and imitation (flattery?) can be fuzzy, but in this case it seems very clear.",1327849145

What I'am writing is propably off-topic and a general objection to some statements made in the comments here.<p>1) the google web fonts directory is very nice, but does anyone really consider those fonts for readable body text? They are great for headlines and short snippets but a complete article - no thank you. There is a great difference between fancyness and usability.<p>2) One Exemple is this myth, that OSX' font rendering is always better thant the rendering of windows' rendering because OSX applies more anti-aliasing to the fonts. As soon as you get to a certain font size - usually the one you use for articles - anti-aliased fonts are a pain-in-the-eyes.<p>3) They might appear worn out but those boring old fonts, like Verdana, that took months to built and cost real money are still the most reliable when it comes to body text. They are boring because there are few alternatives.<p>4) Microsoft payed above average for their fonts. Maybe more than the customers appreciate. But everytime I sit in front of an iPad, MacBook and the like, those dirty fonts destroy the whole product for me. The only way apple is gonna get rid of that cheap rendering performance is by investing in their rendering engine (not gonna happen) or by introducing retina displays in all of their products (more likely to happen).",1327849003

It will see it needs the package at url xyz.com/package.tar.gz, it'll check it's download cache and if it doesn't exist there it will download the file from the url and save it to the cache.<p>The cacheable urls stem from the fact that currently on PyPI you can delete an existing file you've uploaded, and reupload a file of the same name. Pip (and any other cache like varnish etc) isn't notified of the fact that what used to be at url xyz.com/packages.tar.gz is gone and now something else is at xyz.com/packages.tar.gz. This can cause issues with installing packages, especially on remote deployment infrastructures. With crate I place the sha256 of the file in the url, so if someone deletes + uploads the same name, it should still (unless you get (un)lucky and get a collision somehow) have a completely different url, so pip and other caches will see it as a different file.<p>As a side effect it would allow a simple caching proxy to be installed at someones office, or wherever that easily does the behavior you describe as well.

Erlang's the other :)<p>But actually, I heard Rich Hickey has (or had?) some ideas for incorporating Erlang-style message passing into Clojure (at least for distributed, multi-node programs). And Clojure is well designed for that because its persistent data-structures are both immutable (and thus can all serve as safe messages), and are trie-based and so require only little copying upon modification and consequently relatively high-performance.",1327846030

Run a local copy that proxies 404's up to the main crate.io server and then caches the result locally to disk?<p>This would be a very nice way to deal with build-time dependencies. You can get similar behavior today by setting multiple mirrors in pip but this would allow the grabbing packages on-demand instead of having to mirror everything.",1327845737

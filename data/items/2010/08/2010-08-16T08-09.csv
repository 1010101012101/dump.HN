The other half is hidden from your eyes under the guise of an ""employer contribution"" which is a bit of accounting terminology which roughly translates to: straight up bullshit. Employers have no choice but to pay the taxes, on their side it is a cost of maintaining you as an employee, it is thus logically a part of your earnings that you never see on any documentation (imagine if all of your taxes were hidden from you similarly). Self-employed workers have to pay the full 15.3%.<p>And, medical insurance dues. Again employers hide about 2/3 of medical insurance costs from employees by pretending that an ""employer contribution"" to employee health insurance payments isn't a part of the employee's salary. Clearly it is and it's shameful that people don't appreciate how much they are truly paying for their health insurance plans. The reason this practice exists is due to wage controls put in place during WWII, in order for companies to attract good employees they had to figure out ways of offering compensation that didn't appear on IRS documentation, so employer paid health insurance became popular.<p>An American family with insurance through their employer earning the median US income (~50k) pays $3800 in payroll taxes and about $2000 in health insurance contributions every year ($178k over a 30 year career) without ever seeing a line item, a summary, or any scrap of documentation.",1281948886

1607229,comment,1599584,1604890,0,0,loup-vaillant,,,"First, I believe that the world of shrink-wrapped proprietary software should die.<p>Second, I fail to see how inheritance solves your problem: ""<i>The code using LibType is code you don't control; you can't change it to use MyType instead.</i>""<p>OK, let's try this with inheritance.<p><pre><code>  class LibType                { Handles 3 cases       }
  class MyType extends LibType { Handles a fourth case }
</code></pre>
Now tell me: how would you make the code of the library use an object of type `MyType` instead of `LibType`?  If you don't control its code, I see only one way: somewhere, this library expects an object of type `LibType` as a <i>parameter</i>.<p>Interestingly, idiomatic functional programming do just that: passing functions as parameters.  Or tuples of functions, in that case.  You know that an object is just a tuple, right?. For instance:<p><pre><code>  // Statically typed, Class based OO language
  class Foo {
    int   bar(int,);
    float baz(float, int);
    int x;
  }

  -- Haskell
  data Foo = Foo (Int -> Int)
                 (Float -> Int -> Int)
                 Int

  -- The same, with record syntax. (for easy access)
  data Foo = Foo { bar :: Int -> Int
                   baz :: Float -> Int -> Int
                   x   :: Int
                 }
</code></pre>
Note that the functions in objects of type Foo aren't fixed.  So I can override all I want.  Class Polymorphism is cool, but I can do the same with mere parametric polymorphism if I really need to.  Sure, the library must be designed for extensibility in the first place, but the same is true about OO libraries: inheriting from a class that isn't designed with inheritance in mind is dangerous.",1281948719

They accept the rules and the constraints too damn easily.<p>My biz dev friend comes from a traditional background. He is great at what he does. But he will be the first one to acknowledge that his world is very limited by rules.<p>A week ago I asked him to find us the best telemarketer in town and to have him working for us by next Monday(today). I told him to set up 2-3 interviews in the next 5 days. His response? ""That is impossible.."".<p>What part of that is impossible, I asked. So I broke it down for him: there are 2-3 incredible guys in this town of 60,000 people who we could hire for this job.<p>This is exactly what I told him: <i>""you are THREE fucking phone numbers away from meeting the right guy""</i>.<p>That's it. There is nothing more to it, really.<p>Then I asked him to call up all his buds from his last job(in telemarketing) and find out who that top guy is. If they don't know, get at least another ph. number off their friend and ask them. Keep doing that until you find the number of one of the top guys.<p>All this took place Sunday evening. He got in touch with the #1 performer at our campus phonathon through a friend and we had lunch Monday afternoon. Less than 24 hours from the time we hatched the plan, we found our guy.<p>Now I am not a sales guy or a business guy. But programming makes you see BS. A business guy, by default, is full of self-sabotaging BS and limiting beliefs. Ones that are go-getters and refuse to accept the default rules can really add value to your team.",1281946087

With web workers, browser starts a real seperate thread, that will not interrupt the main page thread, hence responsiveness doesn's suffer because of long javascript execution.",1281945918

The countries elites both help themselves to quite a bit of wealth but the russians seem to experience an unsolved tragedy of the commons issue. If this is true, will united russia (or whatever it's called) solve the problem of maximising returns from their control of the country (it did take the PRC communist party a few decades)? How could they?",1281945753

For first time entrepreneurs a few million in the bank is a huge fucking deal.<p>Acquiring companies are getting what they want, too.  Often at the lower prices they want the talent, and I think companies are starting to understand more and more the value of acquiring founder talent.<p>I think we'll see where this goes.  Everything is still playing out and it's a very rapid evolution.  Examples:<p>1) Founder cash-outs are happening more and more, likely in direct response to more frequent early acquisitions.<p>2) Acquiring companies are still experimenting with how to motivate founders after a talent acquisition.  The state of the art for the median case -- shelf their code and throw them into a team often with little creative freedom -- is quite stark.",1281945659

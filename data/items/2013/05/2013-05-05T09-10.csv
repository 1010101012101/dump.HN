""I didn't steal it, officer.  I <i>discovered</i> it.""  :-)<p>If you listen to what Douglas says, he does say it's more a ""discovery"" than an ""invention"".  It was a pattern he'd seen in a few places, and he realized the need for its standardization.  In his view, Rebol was a strong influence on that mindset.  Hence he credits it in that view, and he feels people should take a look at what the language has to offer.<p>Prior to the open sourcing in December I was an outspoken critic of Rebol's proprietary nature...but since my demands were met, I now feel comfortable advocating it.

5657937,comment,5657675,5657675,5,0,matthaeus,,,"What a shame that even Paul Graham seems to be having his issues with a well-considered use of the word ""design"".<p>Degrading ""design"" to mean nothing but ""aesthetics"" is a view of the past, that young, savvy companies know well to avoid by integrating design from the very beginning of product planning stages.<p>(Maybe I'm misinterpreting what PG means. Although why else would he feel the need to use words like ""fashion"" and ""hairstyles from the past"" as an analogy?)<p>I'm especially surprised he uses this example because it doesn't even serve his argument well: The design of a programming language is only marginally related to aesthetics. Why not use an analogy that compares to the more prevalent criteria of a good/bad programming language?<p>On top of that, he makes an array of mistakes in his car analogy, and his use of ""good"" and ""bad"" design.<p>>The Cadillac was carefully designed to appeal to the average driver. The 911 was designed for performance. Which one is better design?<p>This is a moot question, since in real markets, the answer to this question depends on who you ask. Of course, the Porsche looks better according to today's standards. It's also better engineered, has better aerodynamics, etc. etc. etc. But the Cadillac was more widely available, had more leg room, more space in the trunk. And it was probably less expensive.
So yeah. Neutrally speaking, both of these cars are designed well according to certain criteria.<p>>It's easier to tell good design from bad when you're not looking at current fashions.<p>Considering that the 911 aesthetics have not dramatically changed since then, looking at the image of a 1973 model will automatically feel more current, modern and familiar to the viewer.
And speaking of fashion: The Cadillac's aesthetics have specifically gone out of fashion ever since car styling has evolved in a more sculpted and organic direction. No matter what field, anything that's recently out of fashion will be perceived as especially unpleasant and outdated. So how is it fair to compare one product that features aesthetics that are still largely regarded as fashionable, and one that's very specifically regarded as ""yesterday"" and unfashionable?<p>>Good design is timeless<p>If this statement was true, the whole fashion industry would be producing only bad design every single season.
Timelessness of design is also nothing a designer of a product has any long-term control over. A product might be timeless in its design (=aesthetics? feature set? what does PG actually mean?) at the moment of its conception. But if it unwillingly becomes part of a trend (even if just because other companies imitate it), it won't be regarded as absolutely timeless anymore. It will have become a witness of its time, and the trends of that period.
The first iPod could have been regarded as a timeless design when it was launched. But today, it is an unmistakable part of Apple's white plastic period. It is not timeless anymore.<p>""Design"" stands for the planning/execution of all aspects of a product together. That includes aesthetics, feature set, implementation technologies, price point, launch date, market segment and much more. If PG had looked beyond the rather narrow horizon of aesthetics, he could have actually created an analogy that worked for him. Even if it included cars.",1367746377

The intro CS course at my university used to be taught in Scheme and people with literally no programming experience could get the hang of most of the language in the first couple of weeks.<p>The only reason some people view it as difficult is that it is very <i>different</i> from the C-like languages they're already familiar with. Once you've learned one of those, the others are, of course, very easy to pick up. Not because the languages themselves are simple but because they're <i>similar</i>. Scheme, by comparison, has a very different--and <i>much</i> more regular--syntax and very different ways of doing things.<p>Besides, C is relatively difficult to learn: there are a whole bunch of low-level concepts (pointer arithmetic), a large amount of syntax and a <i>ton</i> of edge cases and undefined behavior. Not to mention the preprocessor. It takes much more effort to get even a basic result with C than it does with another language like Scheme.",1367745169

If the project is an experimental iPhone app for promotional purposes, the budget is likely to be constrained.<p>For some odd reason, asking for more money seem to be really hard for many developers.

It's called PER , rural employment plan, it's not exctly BI, as people Is supposed to earn the pay with days recolecting fruits or olives. But there is a lot of fraud and most people avoids doing them but they still receive the paycheck.
Initially it was done to improve the poverty of that country zones, and it certainly has improved, but people has become adicted to the free money and that region is perpetually low growth figures. Peole just works the necesary to live, you must add tha the climate is pretty good and is easy to be at a terrace all day having a coffe or some beers.
This system also is prone to ballot buys by local policians. Every time someone wants to reduce the payments she looses lots of votes.
I think that on it's own BI will improve the living conditions of people dramatically, but on the long run will need to be substituted and complemented by other system.",1367744675

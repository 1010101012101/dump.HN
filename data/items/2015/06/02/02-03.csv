9643573,comment,9642665,9643354,0,0,crdb,,,"Source: been here three years and counting...<p>You forget that the EntrePass (the entrepreneur visa you speak of) requires investors/VCs from an approved list, all of which are Singaporean; and that even SEEDS funding requires a local investor. So if you&#x27;re foreign, or even local but with foreign investors (like, say, a US VC), no funding. I talked to these investors and they either aren&#x27;t investing or want to see 30k/month in revenue. I suspect people were buying themselves residencies with the EntrePass at a fraction of the investor visa amount so they made it ineffective as a visa.<p>On the visa side, I&#x27;ve seen a lot of people play some kind of musical chairs. The key is the local director, so you pay a few hundred dollars to a firm to hold that directorship whilst incorporating, apply for an EP (standard work visa) for yourself which comes through in 7 working days, and then get the local directorship assigned to your EP. This does involve plugging in 50k or so of capital and paying yourself 8k/month (SGD) out of it (income tax being quite low it&#x27;s not too onerous).<p>I don&#x27;t like playing games with immigration (I don&#x27;t know if the EP local directorship game is officious or a hack soon to be eliminated) so my startup is incorporated in the UK and Hong Kong until I get PR (I did Hong Kong first, but the paperwork and agent fees just killed me - I&#x27;d rather pay an accountant and 20% corp tax). That local directorship rule is a real pain in Singapore and I hope a government official is reading this.<p>That being said, if you are a local (citizen/PR), it is cheap and very fast to incorporate a Private Limited, the rule of law is exemplary, taxes are low, and it&#x27;s probably the most visa-friendly first world country in the world.<p>Status-wise I think a lot of bankers and MBAs are getting into &quot;startups&quot;, unfortunately, and just as in the US it&#x27;s become an acceptable career path. I don&#x27;t think the feeling towards startups is any different from say, most European countries, amongst the older folk.<p>Singapore&#x27;s startup scene suffers from the same problem every non-Valley startup scene suffers: the best valuations and deal speed that we hear of in the Valley doesn&#x27;t really exist anywhere else. For example, I remember calculating that the Bay Area received around 20x as much venture funding as the entire of the United Kingdom, despite the latter&#x27;s status as an old startup hub containing the world&#x27;s largest non-US financial centre. The causes have been debated to death in many places, I personally favor the &quot;lack of big exits locally&quot; explanation, which makes it hard for local investors to want to touch the asset class and in turn disincentivizes talent from getting into startups (mostly, they go to the US). When it takes you 6 months instead of 2 weeks to close a round, and you give up 20% instead of 7% for the seed round, it&#x27;s much harder to grow that into a global business.<p>edit - just noticed who the author was. Strongly recommend London based folks go meet him! Zach is a fantastic guy and the kind of investor I would LOVE to have in my startup (if I had investors).",1433213873

It allows unchecked array access - what&#x27;s stopping traditional overflows? I&#x27;ve not used Nim, but compiling to C and exposing a lot of C-like functionality seems to indicate that code will still be subject to the same types of errors. Why do you say this isn&#x27;t the case? Why does the manual not mention such things? (Another example: doesn&#x27;t Nim need most objects to be GC allocated to be safe? So if you&#x27;re not using GC (which I imagine lots of perf sensitive code will want to avoid), what&#x27;s preventing errors there?)<p>Maybe I&#x27;ve got the wrong impression and their docs are terribly misleading and there are safety checks all over.

The best way to encourage more ethnic diversity is to raise the level of education in the schools the go to, as well as dealing with the socio-economic problems that make them disadvantaged compared to their peers.<p>As much as I like the idea in general, introducing Snap as a language specifically targeted for &#x27;underrepresented demographics&#x27; is only going to strengthen the misconception that these demographics are &#x27;less smarter&#x27; than the White and Asian boys who ace programming without needing all these fancy visual blocks.",1433213252

9643534,comment,9641239,9641239,0,0,copsarebastards,,,"This isn&#x27;t the first time something like this has been tried, and my criticism of it is the same: this isn&#x27;t really &quot;programming&quot;.<p>When you create a learning language, you&#x27;re inherently taking a bunch of concepts from modern programming, and you&#x27;re dividing them into two groups: things that you think are necessary for what the student is doing to be called programming, and things that aren&#x27;t necessary.<p>Somewhere along the line, Snap, and its precursor, Scratch, decided that <i>text</i> wasn&#x27;t a necessary part of programming. The motivation for this decision seems to have been that they think that text is part of what scares some people away from programming. That may or may not be true, I don&#x27;t know. But what I do know is that if you aren&#x27;t using text, I have a hard time describing what you&#x27;re doing as programming.<p>Sure, a lot of programming concepts can be expressed visually. But rapidly these visual representations break down when you try to build anything complicated out of them, because you start having to do more complicated things along the way. Version control is tied to text: you can&#x27;t revert part of your changes to a flow diagram easily. As you learn more about a problem domain, you decide you want to rename a variable? Good luck with find/replace without text. Or are you just going to drop the concept of a variable? What&#x27;s the visual representation of a type?<p>The result might be that you get people interested in something you&#x27;re calling programming, but their interest is based on false premises. When you finally expose them to actual programming, all the parts that were too scary to show them to begin with are all there. All you&#x27;re doing is losing them later.<p>I think that BASIC did a much better job of this back in the day. It gave you a lot up-front, and to do this, some of the concepts weren&#x27;t <i>ideally</i> scalable, but there wasn&#x27;t really any upper limit to what you could do with BASIC. The result is that all those scary concepts were there, but you didn&#x27;t have to confront them all at once. Eventually you&#x27;d have to learn that, say, turtle graphics aren&#x27;t the way we really draw things, but until you learned that, you could still do everything you wanted, it was just a little slow. I got all the way up to writing code for real, full-sized robots in BASIC (albeit by that time I had started learning C++). There&#x27;s nothing that would have stopped me from writing real-world applications in BASIC (and indeed, many real-world applications <i>are</i> built in BASIC).<p>It may be that Snap or one of its ancestors will someday reach the level where you could build a real-world application in it. I hope that happens, and I hope it makes programming accessible to everyone. But for now, I don&#x27;t think that what Snap teaches is really programming.",1433213234

It was kinda neat but also not incredibly complex. After the Pre was released within about 6 months it had over 100,000 downloads (which, for a new OS and device, seemed kinda awesome!). It was a free app but I thought I could try to monetize it a little.<p>First step was to try ads. It went from highly rated to about 3 stars because everyone hated the ads (understandable). I tried putting them at the top, bottom, middle; nothing worked at all.<p>There were no in-app purchases for webOS (or really any platform at the time) so I did what everyone else started doing: when they launched being able to pay for apps I provided my app for $.99 with no ads. After 2 years of running I made $9.<p>Essentially I destroyed the user-base my app initially had by trying a couple of ways to monetize them that provided poor user experience. I&#x27;m not sure what the best solution is here but don&#x27;t make my mistake and worsen your user experience to make money; it won&#x27;t work.<p>FYI for anyone curious my app on webOS was a take on the tip calculator. I know I know &quot;why would you try to charge for a TIP calculator!?&quot; but I thought the spin I had was novel, you could rate different parts of your restaurant experience to get an exact amount to tip rather than dealing with percentages at all (it only showed you the percentage after it calculated the tip). I had done a ton of tip research at the time and thought the idea might be worth something (plus I was young and dumb). It even had bill splitting! But yeah in the end I really shouldn&#x27;t have charged for it I mostly wanted to experiment to see if I could monetize it and I ended up completely destroying it. <a href=""http://www.webosnation.com/dumb-waiter-free"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.webosnation.com/dumb-waiter-free</a>",1433213025

In your shoes Id likely move forward in 3 stages;<p>1) Bug Fix - if you can build momentum on growth your really onto something. Given the 80% inactive rate, have you looked at why people are uninstalling (I saw a bunch of no photo upload button on my quick look)? Improving scale if probably the best way to make money if you don&#x27;t really need the cash now.<p>2) Insert reasonably unobtrusive ads and see how they go. Given the countries involved you&#x27;ll be surprised that even with a large number of users you&#x27;re not hitting big money. Possibly try a few different ad placements to see the user experience vs. clicks vs. payments.<p>2) Once you have ads and know how many clicks you are getting, look for local opportunities for the bigger country(ies). Things like sponsorship of affiliate/offer type deals. These should pay more but come with a real time cost.<p>3) Once you have a view how much a customer is worth, decide if you want to take the cash out or re-invest back into growing the app. Ideally if you can spend $X on recruitment and get back $X+Y you should chase growth. If not, enjoy riding the organic wave.<p>Regarding the poll, I&#x27;d not bother. What people say and do are often very different. I&#x27;d be more inclined to test ads and placement for real response. Monitor for feedback and possibly make a ad free version if people want.<p>I&#x27;ve heard donation buttons don&#x27;t really work.<p>Adding additional social support sounds good but at a price? Not sure there. These markets are super cost conscious so I&#x27;d personally look to focus on growth first and secondly monetising the user at no cost to them.<p>Good luck",1433212855

First code that I wrote was in QBASIC at age 10 (I&#x27;m 19 right now), which I found to be very accessible and then later moved on to learning C# with the help of various XNA tutorials (which, I think is great as you get to make your own games as you go and that keeps you interested -- talk about gamification of learning!) and the help of a C# Design Patterns book (a terrible choice for a beginner, but you might as well learning the right way at the start).<p>In fact, the way I see it, by peddling this view of programming we&#x27;re loosing something, something that I can&#x27;t define and yet I can feel as being fundamental. Perhaps people (kids?) will develop an idea that programming is childish and when they grow up they will grow out of programming as well? I&#x27;m not sure. Actually, I remember a great experience toying around and programming Crysis through CryEngine 2 Sandbox editor at age 12, where you could design flowgraph for AI movement (enter this, go there, etc.) and other cool things, and the awesome thing was that you got this immediate feedback and could, for example, observe awesome battles between AIs. This could be a fascinating teaching route to explore, whereby students learn by programming existing (or new!) games in something like UE4 with blueprints, considering most people go into CS with the mindset of &quot;I just want to make games, man&quot; so we should try tapping into that mine.",1433212267

9643470,comment,9642553,9642553,0,0,nhstanley,,,"&quot;Cancer&quot; is a word that describes any disease that is the result of uncontrolled growth of your own cells. However, there are so many types of cancer cells and the treatment for each so different that saying we&#x27;ve &quot;cured cancer&quot; is a prime reason why the public doesn&#x27;t understand or trust these miracle breakthroughs.<p>That being said, these PD-1 inhibitors are a huge breakthrough for any type of cancer that uses this mechanism to evade the immune system. One of the hallmarks of cancer cell growth is their ability to evade the immune system. PD-1 (programmed cell death 1) is a receptor on immune cells like T cells that tells these immune cells to &quot;stand down&quot;/go inactive. Some types of cancer secrete molecules that activate this receptor, inhibiting the immune cells. Drugs like Nivolumab block these receptors, keeping the immune cells active, allowing them to attack cancer cells when they encounter them.<p>Metastisis (cancer cells spreading around the body) is what kills cancer patients, and drug strategies that can keep this from happening are key to keeping people alive. (Re-)activating the immune system against the cancer cells is a great strategy that&#x27;s had some recent breakthroughs. Another recent breakthrough method, called CAR-T cell therapy (chimeric antigen receptor t-cells) also activates the immune system against cancer. In that case, they take immune cells out of the cancer patients body, use gene therapy to inject genetic material needed by the cells to recognize cancer cells, then grow those cell and re-inject them back to the body. This has been wildly successful in certain types of cancer, like certain leukemias and lymphomas, and may be successful for other types. Here is a nice article that covers these general strategies for those interested: <a href=""http://www.forbes.com/sites/matthewherper/2015/04/20/immune-system-drugs-melt-tumors-leading-a-cancer-revolution/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.forbes.com/sites/matthewherper/2015/04/20/immune-...</a><p>There have been a lot of breakthroughs recently.

I enjoy both jobs however I&#x27;m getting more interested in programming.  Not just to automate some of the more boring tasks I do at my main job but because it interests me.  I have a decent amount of experience with HTML and CSS and luckily at work I&#x27;m able to take some classes even if it only intertwines with my work occasionally.<p>So in my free time (after the kids and wife go to bed) I like to work on either learning more about Python or working on some web projects.  However I find it hard to really focus in my office at home possibly because it&#x27;s where I do my work when I work at home. I also have a Mac Mini setup I occasionally set up in the other room but that becomes a hassle to put it away or set it up.<p>Therefore I&#x27;ve come to the conclusion that a laptop might cure what ails me.  I could set up anywhere in the house or even outside on the deck when it&#x27;s nice out.  Ideally I would love a Retina Macbook Pro or even an Air but price is definitely an issue.  I&#x27;ve also looked into used Thinkpads (thanks to the guide I occasionally see posted on HN) but eBay doesn&#x27;t seem to be working in my favor.  I&#x27;ve honestly been hoping a friend or family member has their laptop break so I can fix it and keep it, just because it would be cheap (and I enjoy that type of thing). Perhaps it&#x27;s all just because I like having all kinds of toys around.<p>So all of that to really ask if someone can point me in the right direction for a laptop, or do I really just need to work with what I have?<p>Trying to stay around or less than $200 USD, and would like something ok, just not too big and clunky.",1433211071

Just because you use a smartphone, doesn&#x27;t mean you are qualified to commit to the Linux kernel. I am constantly fascinated by attempts to frame computer science as a trade similar to bricklaying or plumbing. It really could not be further from such work.<p>Computer science is the application of mathematical logic, which by definition, is out of the reach of the majority of students. One look at mathematical aptitude test scores for the general public will disabuse you of the notion that everyone can program. At best, you need to be at least one standard deviation above the mean in mathematical ability to be a competent computer scientist. At worst, factoring in global competition in an unregulated profession, you need to be two to three standard deviations above the mean. Assuming a normal distribution, that&#x27;s about 2.5% of the population.<p>So, why are we lying to kids with promises of Google jobs? If they&#x27;re that good at math, they&#x27;ll know it. They&#x27;ll be autodidacts, and will use the plethora of resources already available to reach their potential.<p>I&#x27;m all for easy to use graphical programming languages, as they truly help to visualize algorithms in a tangible way.

5351016,comment,5348028,5350476,1,0,graycat,,,"Yup, there's a version of each of malloc() and free() there.<p>Maybe that's what was being used in the common versions of C.  If so, then for whatever reason I missed out on that.  I kept seeing in the book where they kept saying that malloc() allocated storage in the 'heap' without being clear on what they meant by a 'heap' although in this thread is an explanation that 'heap' was also used in Algol 68.  Whatever, when they said 'heap' with no explanation, they blew me away.<p>Once I was one of a team of three researchers that did a new language.  Eventually it shipped commercially.  We needed a lot in dynamic storage allocation.  Our approach was to start with an array of pointers, say, for i = 1, 2, ..., 32 or some such, s(i) was a pointer to the start of storage for chunks of size 2^(i-1) + 1 to 2^i.  So, allocate 10 bytes of storage from 16 bytes where 16 = 2^i for i = 4.  That is, i = 4 handles requests of size 9 through 16.  Etc.<p>So, right away at the start of execution for relatively large j, have the operating system allocate a block of storage of size 2^j.  Then for i < j, if need a block of storage for allocations handled by i, get that from storage handled by i + 1, etc. up to j where actually get some storage.  That is, if i = 4 needs storage, get that from i = 5 that handles requests up to size 32 = 2^5.<p>For each i, the allocated blocks are chained together in a linked list and so are the free blocks.  So, for an allocation, look first at the end of the linked list of free blocks.<p>In principle, after enough uses of, call it, free(), could\nreturn some storage for i to the storage for i + 1 but we didn't bother doing that.<p>It always seemed to me that on a virtual memory system where the page size was a power of 2 (aren't they all?), this approach to dynamic memory allocation would be quite good.<p>Later I was using an old version of Fortran, got a big block of storage from the operating system as just an array (right, as a common block known to the linkage editor), and wrote code such as above to have versions of malloc() and free().<p>If what is there in K&R in 8.7 is what was actually being used in the versions of C I used, then I blew it by not writing some code at least to report on storage allocated, freed, 'fragmentation', when allocated, etc.  Basically I was highly concerned that in a relatively complicated program with just malloc() and free() I would make some mistakes in storage allocation and get some bugs that gave symptoms only occasionally and that would be a total pain to diagnose.  ""Last Tuesday after running for four hours we got some strange data in the file and then it blew up.""  Great!  It reminds me of one of those arrangements of a few thousand dominoes on edge where when one tips over they all go, a house of cards, an electric power system with no circuit breakers, a dense city built with no fire safety codes, etc.",1362898632

Measuring the difference is the same as measuring the curvature of space time, which when multiplied by a constant IS the strength of the gravitational field according to general relativity.<p>Another way to see it: take a sphere and draw a circle on it, then measure pi. You can determine the curvature of the sphere once you measure the difference with pi on a flat piece of paper.",1362898488

A lot of people come on facebook and stay there because of apps, charging devs for API access will kill innovation. Also, if something is popular and growing, taxing it will be bad for both the users and the dev if the dev can't pay. Also keep in mind that most popular apps may not have a monetization strategy yet.<p>Apple charges $99 for an SDK. straight up flat fee, annual charge. Are you saying this has seriously harmed innovation for iOS?<p>What I'm proposing isn't even that. It's charging for say, having an app that has more than 10,000 simultaneous users.

5350993,comment,5350778,5350778,15,0,mullr,,,"I'm very suspicious of this and related products.<p>The thing that's really great about all our acoustic musical instruments is that when you push on them, they <i>push back</i>. I don't mean this simply in the normal force sense. Consider a guitar. You've got a string which you press over a fret with your left hand. This can be naively emulated by a switch. But with the guitar, the timber and pitch change depending on <i>how</i> you fret the note, on the finger pressure and position and motion. With your other hand, you might be plucking the string in any of a number of different places, with your finger or with a pick. The sound is affected by your attack angle, how hard you pick, the pick's composition, and so on.<p>A guitar string is clearly a complicated system. There are lots of variables at play. But more importantly, it's a <i>coherent</i> system. It makes sense to us a physical object that can be manipulated. When you pluck the string, you can feel it vibrate in your fretting hand. When you bend the string its tension increases. If you amplify it, you get the sense that you are physically <i>touching</i> the sound.<p>(This is incidentally, why audio latency absolutely KILLS when doing amp simulation)<p>The experience playing a wind instrument is similar. While a saxophone may appear to be something you blow into that has keys, things are really far more complicated than that.<p>Keyboard-based instruments are a little different. Unlike most any symphonic instrument, the piano actually has relatively few parameters per key. There's note velocity... and that's about it. The various sustain pedals also apply. The piano's design trades single note expressivity for the ability to play ten of them at once.<p>It should be noted that computer synthesis (procedural or sampled) of keyboard-based is very convincing. They same cannot be said for any other instrument.<p>Now, what about new kinds of control systems? Most of them tend to fall into two categories. One tries to improve on the piano harmonically, by coming up with a better arrangement of where the notes go. Here's an overview of some: <a href=""http://sequence15.blogspot.jp/2010/03/alternative-keyboards.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://sequence15.blogspot.jp/2010/03/alternative-keyboards....</a>. They try to fix the fact that it's hard to play in different keys on a piano. Whereas on the guitar you can learn a single scale or chord and move it up and down the neck to transpose, things change radically on a piano keyboard.<p>The second category is those like the Seaboard, which try to add new dimensions of control to a regular piano keyboard. Another example is the Contiuum (<a href=""http://www.hakenaudio.com/Continuum/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.hakenaudio.com/Continuum/</a>) It's very common now to have both velocity and continuous pressure sensitivity (aftertouch) on a regular keyboard as well as various side controllers for dealing with pitch or an abstract ""modulation"" parameter.<p>These controllers nearly always buy into the separation of control from synthesis. It makes perfect technical sense. But most of the instruments we would consider to be ""expressive"" don't work that way! In fact piano-style instruments are pretty much the only ones that do.<p>Which leads my to my point: A control mechanism should be considered together with the instrument it controls. It's fantastic that this new keyboard has all these new dimensions that you can map to sound, but what is it REALLY good for? What is the instrument that <i>wants</i> to be controlled in this way? The spiffy new control surfaces nearly always leave this problem unsolved and thus remain little more than novelty items.",1362897933

How do you make it possible for these women to achieve their goals and in the process improve gender balance in the software industry?<p>Tech blog posts/comments and Hacker News being what they are, the opinions I've read have been from the tech-privileged - men and women.

But many computer programmers are programmers today because they had access to a computer programming course in high school, or they had parents or mentors or peers who encouraged them to start programming.  It all starts with access - interest, focus, ambition, motivation, intellect etc are determining factors on career trajectories but these all come later, after access has been granted.<p>If Formula 1 teams started signing female drivers en masse, the likelihood of one of them being a Saudi would be effectively zero.  I apologize, that's hardly a fair analogy, but it underscores my point that it all boils down to access.  If one of those hypothetical female drivers happened to be a Saudi princess, raised in Belgium with access to Spa in the off-season and Michael Schumacher's 1994 championship-winning Benetton, and she couldn't see why other women needed special training programs, why I wouldn't know what to make of that.  Again, I agree, not a fair analogy.",1362897444

Anyways I am interested in developing for the iPhone, as I'll be getting one in a few months. I've never really developed any type of games before, but am in a game design school magnet, and want to begin to learn how to program as I've been meaning to for a while now.<p>Your question would read much better if you break them up into paragraphs like I did for you below, especialy since you have numbered them. Remember, you want to help a person help you.<p>> I'm interested in developing for the iPhone, and know I need a Mac, Objective-c knowledge as well as XCode knowledge, and a $99 Subscription to be able to sell and test my apps. So here's some questions I've been wanting to ask for awhile...<p>> 1 Would you recommend a Mac-Mini ? I see i5 Mac mini's on craigslist going for around $400-$450, and know I could afford that. I switch between my mom/dad's house weekly, and have a Windows based desktop that I built w/ monitor at each house, So I'm thinking i could just bring a small Mac-Mini back and forth with me, as they're pretty small.<p>Since you already have a monitor, a Mac mini is fine. I'm not sure if you need different keyboards though. Otherwise consider a low end macbook air. The models in recent years all come with SSDs and they help make compilation faster.<p>> 2 Could you guy's point me towards some nice Objective-C or XCode tutorials or books? I've just started spring break and want to take advantage of the time off.<p>The Stanford University iOS videos on iTunes are great. Apple's iOS docs are excellent too, always refer to them.<p>> 3 I'm only 15, so how would I go about selling apps, Ill probably have mostly free apps but would like to incorporate paid versions too, and I know i need to be 18 to sign a contract, would i just get my mom to sign the contract, and if she gets taxed extra I would just pay her the amount she was taxed ? (BTW, I'm in FL)<p>You'll need local advice for that. But don't let this stop you.<p>> 4 How would I sell apps under a company name, I've heard of people trying to list apps and it saying they're real name instead of a company / made up name. There are obvious reasons I'd like to sell an app under a company name, no one wants to buy an app from a company named, for example ""Steve"". It pretty much set's your app up for failure. Would I have to register all kinds of legal crap just to make it say a developer name like, for example "" FunTide Apps"".<p>It's typically slower getting a company account approved and in my opinion, people tend not to notice the company name. But in general, it's best if you can set up a company for any business ventures.<p>> 5 If there's any advice you'd like to give to me or info that I didnt ask for PLEASE do, it's greatly appreciated.<p>Think about marketing. How will people know about your app? Making the app is only 50% of the work. It's a shame to spend 3 months of your life working on something and not showing it to anyone.",1362897126

The 'what about men?' argument is something that you see a lot in many spaces where women's rights and inclusion is discussed, and it's a derailment from the point. We're not discussing men's non-traditional career choices, and if we were, the barriers and issues to be discussed would be very different. That's not to say that isn't an interesting topic, but the discussion turning to be about men happens in so many discussions about women and equality that it's become a cliche (queue larger point about society in general). What you can do is ask what men, who share an interest in an egalitarian society, can do to help women in this instance.<p>2. You probably don't mean to, but you're displaying a lot of privilege here (in the technical sense, not pejorative): by that I mean you're making an unstated assumption that the barriers that women face getting into the field are the same as what you faced, and therefore that, given those small and inconsequential barriers, they just must not be interested -- if they were it would be as easy for them as it was for you! Sorry to say that it's not that simple, and men's and women's experiences of tech and education and society just aren't the same, for the most part, and for the most part it's women who have the lower-quality experience.",1362897000

5350913,comment,5348028,5350307,1,0,graycat,,,"1) On malloc() and free(), right, I was free just to\nwrite my own.  I should have.  At various times\nsince for various reasons, I have just written my\nown.<p>On your<p>""K&R and other good C references describe their\npublic interface well and that's all you need to\nknow to use them effectively.""<p>I want more.  By analogy, all you need to drive a\ncar is what you see sitting behind the steering\nwheel, but I also very much want to know what is\nunder the hood.<p>Generally I concluded that for 'effective' 'ease of\nuse', writing efficient code, diagnosing problems,\netc., I want to know what is going on at least one\nlevel deeper than the level at which I am making the\nmost usage.<p>Your example of putting a 100,000 byte array on the\nstack is an example:  Without knowing some about\nwhat is going on one level deeper, that seems to be\nan okay thing to do.<p>2) My remark about the stack is either not quite\ncorrect or is not being interpreted as I intended.\nFor putting an array on a push down stack of\nstorage, I am fully aware of the issues.  But on a\n'stack', maybe also the one used for such array\nallocations (that PL/I called 'automatic'; I'm not\nsure there is any corresponding terminology in C),\nthere is also the arguments passed to functions.  It\nseemed that this stack size had to be requested via\nthe linkage editor, and if too little space was\nrequested then just the argument lists needed for\ncalling functions could cause a 'stack overflow'.  A\nproblem was, it was not clear how much space the\nargument lists took up.<p>Then there was the issue of passing an array by\nvalue.  As I recall, that meant that the array would\nbe copied to the same stack as the arguments.  Then\none array of 100,000 bytes could easily swamp any\nother uses of the stack for passing argument lists.<p>But even without passing big 'aggregates' by value\nor allocating big aggregates as 'automatic' storage\nin functions, there were dark threats, difficult to\nanalyze or circumvent, of stack overflow.  To write\nreliable software, I want to know more, to be able\nto estimate what resources I am using and when I\nmight be reaching some limit.  In the case of the\nstack allocated by the linkage editor for argument\nlists, I didn't have that information.<p>3) Sure, I could make use of the strings in C as C\nintended just as you state, just for textural data,\nbut also have to assume a single byte character set.<p>I thought that that design of strings was too\nlimited for no good reason.  That is, with just a\nslightly different design, could have strings that\nwould work for text with a single byte character set\nalong with a big basket of other data types.  That's\nwhat was done in Fortran, PL/I, Visual Basic .NET,\nand string packages people wrote for C.<p>The situation is similar to what you said about\nmalloc():  All C provided for strings was just a\npointer to some storage; all the rest of the string\nfunctionality was just in some functions, some of\nwhich, but not all, needed the null termination.\nSo, what I did with C strings was just use the\nfunctions provided that didn't need the null\nterminations or write my own little such functions.<p>As I mentioned, I didn't struggle with null\nterminated strings; instead right from the start I\nsaw them as just absurd and refused ever to assume\nthat there was a null except in the case when I was\ngiven such a string, say, from reading the command\nline.<p>It has appeared that null terminated strings have\nbeen one of the causes of buffer overflow malware.\nTo me, expecting that a null would be just where C\nwanted it to be was asking too much for reliable\ncomputing.<p>3) On casts, we seem not to be communicating well.<p>Data conversions are important, often crucial.  As I\nrecall in C, the usual way to ask for a conversion\nis to ask for a 'cast'.  Fine:  The strong typing\npolice are pleased, and I don't mind.  And at times\nthe 'strongly typed pointers' did save me from some\nerrors.<p>But the question remained:  Exactly how are the\nconversions done?  That is, for the set D of\n'element' data types -- strings, bytes,\nsingle/double precision integers, single/double\nprecision binary floating point, maybe decimal,\nfixed and/or floating, and for any distinct a, b in\nD, say if there is a conversion from a to b and if\nso what are the details on how it works?<p>One reason to omit this from K&R would have been\nthat the conversion details were machine dependent,\ne.g., depended on being on a 12, 16, 24, 32, 48, or\n64 bit computer, signed magnitude, 2's complement,\netc.<p>Still, whatever the reasons, I was pushed into\nwriting little test cases to get details, especially\non likely 'boundary cases', of how the conversions\nwere done.  Not good.<p>Sure, this means that I am a sucker for using a\nlanguage closely tied some particular hardware.  So\nfar, fine with me:  Microsoft documents their\nsoftware heavily for x86, 32 or 64 bits, from Intel\nor AMD, and now a 3.0 GHz or so 8 core AMD processor\ncosts less than $200.  So I don't mind being tied to\nx86.<p>On PL/I:  Thankfully, no, it was not nearly the\nfirst language I learned.  Why thankfully?  Because\nthe versions I learned were huge languages.  Before\nPL/I I had used Basic, Fortran, and Algol.<p>PL/I was a nice example of language design in the\n'golden age' of language design, the 1960s.  You\nwould likely understand PL/I quickly.<p>So, PL/I borrowed nesting from Algol, structures\nfrom Cobol, arrays and more from Fortran,\nexceptional condition handling from some themes in\noperating system design, threading (that it called\n'tasking' -- current 'threads' are 'lighter in\nweight' than the 'tasks' were -- e.g., with 'tasks'\nall storage allocation was 'task-relative' and was\nfreed when the task ended), and enough in bit\nmanipulation to eliminate most uses of assembler in\napplications programming.  It had some rather nice\ncharacter I/O and some nice binary I/O for, say,\ntape.  It tried to have some data base I/O, but that\nwas before RDBMS and SQL.<p>In the source code, subroutines (or functions) could\nbe nested, and then there were some nice scope of\nname rules.  C does that but with only one level of\nnesting; PL/I permitted essentially arbitrary levels\nof nesting which at times was darned nice.<p>Arrays could have several dimensions, and the upper\nbound and lower bound of each could be any 16 bit\nintegers as long as the lower was <= the upper -- 32\nbit integers would have been nicer, and now 64 bit\nintegers.  Such array addressing is simple:  Just\ncalculate the 'virtual origin', that is, the address\nof the array component with all the subscripts 0,\neven if that location is out in the backyard\nsomewhere, and then calculate all the actual\ncomponent addresses starting with the virtual origin\nand largely forgetting about the bounds unless have\nbounds checking turned on.  Nice.<p>A structure was, first-cut, much like a struct in C,\nthat is, an ordered list of possibly distinct data\ntypes, except each 'component' could also be a\nstructure so that really was writing out a tree.\nThen each node in that tree could be an array.  So,\ncould have arrays of structures of arrays of\nstructures.  Darned useful.  Easy to write out,\nread, understand, and use.  And dirt simple to\nimplement just with a slight tweak to ordinary array\naddressing.  So, it was just an 'aggregate', still\nall in essentially contiguous, sequential storage.\nSo, there was no attempt to have parts of the\nstructure scattered around in storage.  E.g., doing\na binary de/serialize was easy.  The only tricky\npart was the same as in C:  What to do about how to\ndocument the alignment of some element data types on\ncertain address range boundaries.<p>Each aggregate has a 'dope vector' as I described.\nSo, what was in an argument list was a pointer to\nthe dope vector, and it was like a C struct with\ndetails on array upper and lower bounds, a pointer\nto the actual storage, etc.<p>PL/I had some popularity -- Multics was written in\nit.<p>For C, PL/I was solid before C was designed.  So, C\nborrowed too little from what was well known when C\nwas designed.  Why?  The usual reason given was that\nC was designed to permit a single pass compiler on a\nDEC mini-computer with just 8 KB of main memory and\nno virtual memory.  IBM's PL/I needed a 64 KB\n360/30.  But there were later versions of PL/I that\nwere nice subsets.<p>It appears that C caught on because DEC's mini\ncomputers were comparatively cheap and really\npopular in technical departments in universities;\nUnix was essentially free; and C came with Unix.  So\na lot of students learned C in college.  Then as PCs\ngot going, the main compiled programming language\nused was just C.<p>Big advantages of C were (1) it had pointers crucial\nfor system programming, (2) needed only a relatively\nsimple compiler, (3) had an open source compiler\nfrom Bell Labs, and (4) was so simple that the\ncompiled code could be used in embedded\napplications, that is, needed next to nothing from\nan operating system.<p>The C pointer syntax alone is fine.  The difficulty\nis the syntax of how pointers are used or implied\nelsewhere in the language.  Some aspects of the\nsyntax are so, to borrow from K&R, 'idiosyncratic'\nthat some examples are puzzle problems where I have\nto get out K&R and review.<p>To me, such puzzle problems are not good.<p>I will give just one example of C syntax:<p>i = j+++++k;<p>Right:  Add 1 to k; add that k to j and assign the\nresult to i; then add one to j.  Semi-, pseudo-,\nquasi-great.<p>I won't write code like that, and in my startup I\ndon't want us using a language that permits code\nlike that.",1362895219

4865347,comment,4861960,4865039,1,0,ColinWright,,,"This was Fourier's big theorem, that every periodic, non-pathological function is ""simply"" the sum of phase-shifted sine waves of all necessary frequencies.  You can remove the ""periodic"" if you allow infinitely many frequencies, and so on.  The phase-shifting is taken care of by having a sine and a cosine at the same frequency, but (possibly) different amplitudes.<p>So start with a periodic wave and look at how much sin(x) is in it.  Do this by integrating:<p><pre><code>    Integral from 0 to 2.pi of f(x)*sin(x) dx\n</code></pre>\nThat's a dot product of your function <i>f(x)</i> with the sine wave, and that tells you how much of the first frequency you need.  Subtract off the result, and then go again with <i>sin(2x)</i>.  You find the residuals get less and less.  More, for something nice like a square wave or triangular wave the coefficients you get form a predictable sequence.<p>Interesting note:<p><pre><code>    integral sin(k.x)*sin(m.x)\n</code></pre>\nis 0 if k != m, and 1 otherwise, so the basis elements have dot-product 0, and hence are thought of as being at right angles.  They also have ""length"" 1, since the dot-product with themselves is 1.  So they are an ortho-normal basis.<p>So the question is: what functions can be reached by adding and subtracting multiples of sine (and cosine) functions of different frequencies?  In Linear Algebra terms, what is the space of functions spanned by these basis functions?<p>That's harder, but it turns out to be ""everything non-pathological"".<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourier_series#Hilbert_space_interpretation"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourier_series#Hilbert_space_in...</a><p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hilbert_space#Fourier_analysis"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hilbert_space#Fourier_analysis</a><p><i>Edited for typos</i>",1354543143

4865312,comment,4864190,4864471,1,0,alexkus,,,"""better profit"" but only in the eyes of accountants, for a while.<p>The money you've paid less tax on is still offshore. If you want to bring it back to your country then you have to pay tax on it (minus what you've paid already overseas) so it's not just a simple scheme to minimise tax. If you need the money to maintain cash flow then you've got no real choice but to pay full whack on it to get it back into the US.<p>What many US companies are doing is hoarding huge piles of it overseas in the hope that the US will have another tax amnesty (like 2004) and they can bring it back in to the US without paying as much tax as they would have had they just paid it in the US in the first place.<p>Here's a simplified example based roughly on real figures.<p>Take a US company that makes a $1bn profit in a year. They would have to pay 35% tax on that if they kept it in the US.<p>Using a Double Irish Agreement and paying a $1bn fee to those foreign entities in Ireland/Cayman Islands they make $0 profit in the US and pay $0 corporation tax. In Ireland they pay 12.5% tax on that money, so Ireland get $125m.<p>Meanwhile the cash sits overseas and the US company can't use it. If they wanted to bring it back to the UK they'd need to pay a $225m tax bill (35% tax on $1bn minus what is paid overseas); it's unsurprisingly more complicated than that but we'll leave it simple. It's also earning interest overseas but we'll ignore that for this example.<p>What they can do is bung this $225m on the balance sheet as a future tax liability, since if the worst happens and they run in to cash flow problems they'd have to bring all of the original money back into the US and pay remaining tax on it. Ironically, this means they can offset even more profits against this liability.<p>Anyway, they wait until the US has a tax amnesty for bringing back money from overseas (last one in 2004) and then pay a fraction of the tax they would have originally. The current campaign is for an amnesty rate of just 5.25%<p>How much is this used, and on what scale?<p>If you believe the numbers in this article: <a href=""http://news.yahoo.com/apples-phantom-taxes-hide-billions-profit-183821426--finance.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.yahoo.com/apples-phantom-taxes-hide-billions-pro...</a> then Apple has <i>$74bn</i> in cash accounts overseas.",1354542464

Period. We can have great discussions around what kinds of measurements to have and how to apply them, but money should not go out the door without some indication that something is happening as a result of it -- even the wrong thing. In fact, big visible indicators of the wrong thing happening as a result of measurements is a terrific result. If we're arguing over measurement, the game is already lost.<p>Another way of stating this is that let's say I pick a measurement to implement. It's a terrible measurement, and it causes much pain and suffering. You come to me and say ""This is a terrible measurement and causes much pain and suffering!"" To which I respond ""How do you know this?""<p>So you show me a study -- another form of measurement! Then we have a conversation about including parts of your study in my measurement, scrapping my measurement entirely, and so forth.<p>We cannot have meaningful conversations about management without measuring things. Once we start measuring things, the world is wide open about which things to measure. But if you convince me that the act of measuring itself is broken, we have no further basis for any conversation around performance at all. Management has no function. There is no quantifiable return for any possible amount of money I might invest. Very bad.<p>We don't need to wait around to pick the perfect measurement or do nothing at all. We need to pick measurements -- any measurements -- and rapidly iterate towards finding what works best for us.<p>If the testing system is broken, and I have no doubt that it is, it's broken based on bureaucrats creating a large, brittle, hard-to-change architecture of testing, instead of just trying to continuously evolve what works best. It has failed because we put the same idiots in charge of school testing that were creating the mess the tests were supposed to fix in the first place.",1354540330

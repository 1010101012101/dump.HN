Time and again people have claimed for strong measures, aggressive efforts, and assertive changes. Never have I seen an actual recommendation. Is it just common knowledge what should be done? Bob Herbert says ""decent wages"" like it is a commonly understood legal term...but what is the market value of their labor? I am not asking this as a free-market capitalist libertarian devotee, but more from the perspective of ""Ok, so what do you want [me|theGovernment|bigCorp] to do?""<p>Also, why the hell don't journalists cite sources?

677793,comment,677473,677599,0,0,Locke1689,,,"I am appropriately corrected. This actually doesn't change my view at all, because when I said ""moderately complex,"" I assumed that the natural numbers where included in that. If you go back to read Descartes and Kant you'll see much of the same treatment - the addition operation as defined by our algebra of the set of the natural numbers is used many times as an example of a priori knowledge.<p>You are completely correct though - it was very late when I first commented on this and was tired and simply wrong. I'll try and be much more specific in my treatment of mathematics in the future, although I am not a mathematician. I just want to note that I never claimed that Gödel proved that Peano arithmetic was incomplete or inconsistent (although if I remember correctly, he could not prove that the whole of PA was consistent), but simply that the nature of Peano arithmetic does not imbue any a priori knowledge of the universe or our existence. This is supported by Gödel in the broad sense that we cannot generate a ""universal theory"" of mathematics. However, my main point is that mathematics is not truth, it is only a model of our definitions and observations -- a tool, if you will -- and an incomplete model at that.",1246206378

As the article elaborates on, depression is, crudely put, <i>mental pain</i>, and it comes with symptoms such as general lack of motivation. How does that fit with the over all good of the pack? Wouldn't the expected behavior be acceptance of the omega situation and great motivation to sacrifice itself for the pack (as in wolf packs where there is kinship involved)?

That doesn't mean we should encourage this confusion.  I see this frequently in technical channels where people have HTML questions but lack the vocabulary to express them or comprehend the answer.  One of the very first things an HTML newbie must learn is the correct names for elements, tags and attributes, which usually means unlearning the incorrect use of 'tag'.<p>Is this a nitpick?

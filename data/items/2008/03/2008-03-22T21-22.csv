143586,comment,143148,143417,0,0,sofal,,,"Incorrect. I for one hate my day job at a large corporation and will quit soon. Many of the things that PG says about big companies resonates with me. I truly feel like a caged animal and I look around me and I see some of the things that PG describes. I feel so different from people that work here that sometimes I wonder if I'm a different breed of person. I have a rebellious inclination toward all of the rules and traditions here. From this experience I've become more inclined to work in a smaller company or as a researcher (and possibly a startup some day).<p>However, I found the article to assume too much about what is natural and fulfilling for programmers. I realize that there are reasons for being biased towards creating startups, but the essay really does come across as being very skewed and not very well rounded because of it. Jumping into a startup can come with huge risks and sacrifices that can be anything but natural and fulfilling for some people. Startup companies can vary widely in the actual benefit they have to their customers as well, which is an important criteria for some people's fulfillment. Is the startup just about satisfying the customers' desires for entertainment and socializing, or is it helping people in a much deeper way? Is it just about pandering to the flawed values of the audience, or is it about pushing the state of the art? For many people it can't just be about financial freedom and being bought out. There are so many different aspects of ""natural"" and ""fulfilling"" and Paul seems to ignore a lot of them, possibly even misrepresenting some.",1206222578

143581,comment,143503,143559,0,0,curtis,,,"I've certainly considered that idea.  There are two big questions here: 1. What does the API look like? 2. How do I promote it to that particular audience?<p>Right now websites could use the existing service to manually add links to new content.  Certain features might make such usage quite a bit easier, for example the ability to take text markup (MediaWiki markup, MarkDown, etc.) and spit it out with links added in the appropriate syntax.  This would still be manual, but it would be pretty easy to use.<p>A fully automatic API could be something as simple as ""include this .js file"".  That's simple, but not very efficient (caching would help of course), and doesn't present the best user experience (there would generally be a delay where the text is visible in the browser, but links haven't been added yet.)  A server-side API would certainly be better, but then you have a whole bunch of different server types to support: PHP, Python, Ruby, Java, ASP.NET, or even application specific like WordPress or Drupal, etc.<p>I could probably roll a client-side JavaScript inclusion API in a weekend, but it would probably take another couple of weekends to implement decent caching.<p>A server-side solution is ultimately the right way to go, but is there a way to get maximum bang for the buck?  Just expose an XML API and let other people do the server-side integration?",1206222168
143580,comment,143460,143460,0,0,icky,,,"I work in this industry.<p>The article mentioned trucks being sent into residential areas (or through tunnels/bridges that weren't meant for them).    Google maps doesn't know what type of vehicle you're driving, but if you bought a vehicle with a navigation device factory-installed, then (at least for newer models), it does know, and any decent (and recent!) in-vehicle device won't send, for example, a commercial truck through a road not classed for it.<p>You also (again, with any sane, recent device) won't be routed through unpaved or construction roads.  The device might not even be loaded with those non-routes.<p>Another consideration is, whether the maps were installed in the factory, or whether the device goes online to pull more recent maps (the obvious trade-offs apply), real road conditions, lane closures, detours, etc., happen faster and more ephemerally than any data provider can or will update their source data.<p>When driving, always use your eyes and your brain.

143575,comment,143148,143148,0,0,gruseom,,,"Paul Graham's essays have this weird Rorschach quality whereby people see wildly different things in them. Some readers even get infuriated and seek relief in the judgment that Paul Graham is an arrogant asshole. But I don't buy that. (For one thing, if he were, then this site would be more of a personality cult than it is, and many of us would be long gone.) So I'm curious as to why his essays have this effect on people. It <i>is</i> the essays, by the way. You don't hear people saying, ""He sold Viaweb to Yahoo? What an asshole!"" or ""He started a new kind of investment fund, the arrogant prick!""<p>I've got a little theory. It seems to me that the provocative thing about the essays is their <i>aesthetic</i>. They're governed by a particular style. One principle in it is minimalism: compress the writing until everything extraneous is gone. Another is vividness: whatever is being said, seek the phrase or image that throws the point into the sharpest possible relief.<p>The dominant quality of the essays is that they pursue this aesthetic with utter ruthlessness. Anything that would use a few extra words to reassure the reader is thrown out. Anything that would tone down an idea a little bit to make it more palatable is thrown out. There isn't any room for these things because the author is optimizing for something else - say, meaning per word count. In fact, an entire dimension of language, the phatic dimension, is thrown out.<p>So, Paul Graham's writing is radically aphatic. That's disorienting. People are used to writing that includes, among its various threads, one whose purpose is to reassure you that the author is a nice guy, that he might be wrong, you can still get along even if you disagree, and so on. This is not only absent from the essays, it's been deliberately excised. On top of that, what <i>is</i> there has been distilled for maximum impact and often touches subjects that people have strong emotions about, such as programming languages and what the hell we're doing with our lives :). Not surprisingly, some readers feel punched in the gut. For them, an obvious explanation is ready at hand: Paul Graham's writing is like this because <i>he</i> is like this. He must be someone who doesn't care how others feel and wants only to magnify his own grandiose ideas. In short, an arrogant asshole.<p>I think this explains why people project so much emotion into what they read in those essays. ""Oh... you haven't founded a company? You suck."" But the essays never say anything like that. People don't read them this way because they <i>say</i> such things. They read them this way because they <i>lack</i> the kinds of things writers are expected to put in to stave off provocation. They lack these things not because the author is an asshole but because he cares about a certain style of <i>writing</i>. Enough, in fact, to pursue it ruthlessly... in his writing. To naively map that back to the personality of the writer is an obvious error, a kind of reverse ad hominem. But it's an understandable error. There aren't many people who care that much about an aesthetic. (I mean ""aesthetic"" in a broad sense, by the way. As much a way of thinking as a cosmetic thing.)<p>No doubt there is a connection between an author's personality and his style, but it's hardly an isomorphism. I don't know Paul Graham, but I know he doesn't talk the way he writes. For one thing, one can point to examples (like the interview in Founders At Work). For another, nobody talks like that.",1206221599

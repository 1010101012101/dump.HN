6785418,comment,6785160,6785364,5,0,jkrems,,,"Actually ran this on Chrome/V8 and the native method was faster. And as someone else wrote: lodash/underscore should normally fall back to the native methods if available.<p>As for bind - funny that you mention that as a good alternative to using self/closure. Because while it is convenient and powerful, it&#x27;s also slower than using self/closure.<p>I don&#x27;t want to pretend that for either `[].forEach` or `bind` the differences in speed are (in most cases) really that relevant, I just found your argumentation a little confusing here. As for bind vs. closure-self I wouldn&#x27;t say that either is really better than the other. Both are perfectly fine options. The former is a pretty heavy solution (since it&#x27;s basically using a special case of partial application) and can be confusing (e.g. calling `a.b()` can have weird behavior even when the implementation of b is known). The latter is less powerful but a little more explicit imho - you really see the this-scope expansion and it&#x27;s not hidden away. Both solutions obviously can&#x27;t protect you from &quot;flock of seagull style nested function code&quot; but as you wrote: that&#x27;s not a problem of the way someones does this-binding, it&#x27;s a problem with the design.",1385186394

The depth of the site (reported on the BBC link) is 650 meters below current sea level, but only 183 meters on the wordpress link.  However, at peak glaciation during the last ice age, sea levels were only about 130 meters lower than they are today.

6785356,comment,6784094,6784648,1,0,msandford,,,"Okay, we have really different views on economics.  I would tend to disagree philosophically with the idea that &quot;you have to whip their asses with the printing press&quot; and as a result you and I probably won&#x27;t agree on anything.  That&#x27;s OK, we don&#x27;t have to.<p>I take the position that economic output driven my market manipulation (money printing, fixing the interest rate, driving inflation, etc) is undesirable because it sends signals to people about profits or losses or the amount of real resources available via the interest rate that aren&#x27;t necessarily representative of reality.  An example:<p>In magic-land there is no Fed and the interest rate is a number that clears the market between lenders and borrowers.  As people save money they increase the amount of cash that banks have on hand.  While they&#x27;re saving money, they&#x27;re not spending it and thus some amount of resources are piling up in the real world too, in unison with the amount of savings in the bank.  As the banks&#x27; cash on hand goes up and nobody is borrowing, they will tend to reduce the rate of interest charged to induce more people to borrow, and reduce the rate of interest paid to reduce people&#x27;s predilection to save.  This causes the money to go to work, and at the same time, those resources which were piled up unused in the real world (in parallel with the money) were also put to work.  To me this is a good thing, that stockpiles of money in the bank mirror stockpiles of raw materials in the real world as a result of people&#x27;s reduced consumption and increased savings.<p>Now introduce the Fed which by virtue of it&#x27;s ability to print money can cause bank deposits to increase while the raw materials don&#x27;t pile up similarly.  This causes all kinds of incorrect signals to propagate through socioeconomic life and induces people to make &quot;bad&quot; decisions.  In my view this is unfortunate to have people making decisions thinking that the world is one way when in fact it is not, and perhaps going bankrupt as a result.<p>I imagine there might be disagreement about the relative importance of signalling vs. just making sure that money circulates, no matter what to keep the economy going.  But would you disagree that the interest rate -- in the absence of a body which fixes the interest rate -- could tend to serve as a signal for the amount of under/over consumption that&#x27;s happening in society?  If so, why?  And if you agree that it could, why is it not harmful to change that signal artificially?<p>EDIT: Even though I don&#x27;t think we&#x27;ll agree, thanks for explaining.  Much appreciated.",1385184752

I didn&#x27;t mention it but the place I live now which also has no FIOS is Harrisburg, PA. This is the Detroit you never heard of with 7x the public debt per capita vs. Detroit. The long-time mayor took a bunch of loans for stuff like a Wild West museum and left the city crippled with debt. They are in the process of selling off assets to avoid bankruptcy. Same deal here as Baltimore, too expensive to play ball with the city council so it isn&#x27;t worth it to get a license but FIOS is everywhere in surrounding municipalities.",1385183120

HIV is very careful (i.e. has evolved) to stay dormant for a long time... it probably didn&#x27;t start out that way, and suffered as a result.  Any sort of pathogen that targets the immune system has to be similarly careful; otherwise it suffers the same fate of all extremely lethal pathogens: killing the host population faster than it can spread.<p>Another promising research avenue is bacteriophages.  I don&#x27;t know why it&#x27;s being pursued more in the former Soviet Union than it is in the West.  I suppose even with targeted bacteriophages there&#x27;s some risk that they could mutate and start targeting beneficial bacteria, which would be a problem.<p>A cute CS-inspired theoretical approach would be to throw variable layers at the problem.  With genetic engineering, create bacteria that function as a supplemental immune system, but in a very narrow way; the bacteria would, possibly in collaboration with the host immune system, generate specific bacteriophages for any pathogenic bacteria they come into contact with.  Obviously it wouldn&#x27;t work against pathogenic <i>viruses</i>, but other than the (perhaps impossible) difficulty of having a cell able to generate novel bacteriophages, it doesn&#x27;t seem so outlandish.  If we get to the point where we can write code for a wide variety of biological activity and get it translated into DNA, then such a bacteriophage-generating bacterium might be possible.<p>I realize there are pathologies imaginable with any possible solution.  The question is how likely is it that natural or engineered pathogens will target whatever new targets are available.  Bacteriophage-generating bacteria could be hijacked by viruses, mutated by gene transfer with harmful bacteria to do bad things, or even give their bacteriophage-generating properties to pathological bacteria which might then gain mutations to generate human-targeting viruses... wouldn&#x27;t <i>that</i> be fun.",1375030470

6117189,comment,6113786,6116223,2,0,vidarh,,,"The problem with bacteriophages is that they require identifying the specific infection, and then identifying a bacteriophage that is suitable for just that infection.<p>In comparison, part of the reason we&#x27;re in this situation in the first place is because doctors can&#x27;t even be bothered to figure out which antibiotic is suitable, or whether or not you actually have a bacteria infection, but often just prescribes first-line antibiotics and tells you to come back if you&#x27;re still ill afterwards. That means 5-10 minutes per patient many places.<p>If we were to try to switch to bacteriophages, on the other hand, it&#x27;d mean blood tests and lab work to identify the specific infection and strain for every patient, with resulting massive cost increases.<p>In it&#x27;s current state, it&#x27;s a last way out, but it&#x27;s far away from being a viable large scale replacement for antibiotics.",1375030456

The password is used in a KDF to generate a key, which in turn decrypts the user&#x27;s private key (and certain other credentials, along with symmetric secret keys for shared encrypted doccuments). Success/failure is determined solely by the successful decryption of known bytes in the encrypted package. Other info (the user&#x27;s public key, identity and certifier, all signed) are maintained in the clear and can be easily and safely exported and may be &quot;trusted&quot; for authentication with remote machines. There is a &quot;password recovery&quot; system as well (it doesn&#x27;t actually recover the password, but allows a reset), requiring cooperation of two or more admins¹ (in a Shamir-type arrangement) so that previously-encrypted user data will not be lost.<p>¹ There is the option to use a single admin, but there are great big warning signs and scary red boxes all over that section of the doco.

But, there are some practical things you can do to make the attacker&#x27;s life harder:<p>- Don&#x27;t write your own cryptographic code or design your own crypto systems; use existing libraries as much as possible.<p>- Separate your reads from your writes. Using a public/private key pair, you can give one set of systems the ability to write encrypted data but not read it, and a different set of systems the ability to read the data. The systems that can decrypt / read data should be isolated as much as possible - don&#x27;t expose them to public networks, limit which operators have access to them, etc. The separation also forces you to encapsulate your secure data and define an API over it; rather than arbitrary reads, hosts that don&#x27;t have the decryption keys will have to ask the hosts that do to perform specific operations. If you&#x27;re writing a Rails app, the Strongbox gem [1] enforces this pattern for you.<p>- Rotate your encryption keys.<p>- Don&#x27;t store keys in code. Follow the Heroku pattern [2] of storing any sensitive data (i.e. private keys) in the environment, where it is bound at runtime to your code and encrypted data.<p>- Store as little sensitive data as possible. Make sure data you don&#x27;t need any more is periodically purged.<p>- Human processes are just as important as code; keep track of who has access to sensitive data, make that access opt-in, and remove it when those people change jobs or are terminated. Do everything in your power to keep those operators from being phished (user education, two-factor auth, etc).<p>- Don&#x27;t store credit cards if at all possible. Find a payment processor [3] to do it for you. It&#x27;s not worth the headache, it makes you a more attractive target, and it may come with additional legal overhead (depending on your jurisdiction).<p>[1] <a href=""https://github.com/spikex/strongbox"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/spikex/strongbox</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://12factor.net/config"" rel=""nofollow"">http://12factor.net/config</a><p>[3] <a href=""https://stripe.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://stripe.com/</a>",1375027839

If you just stick a disclaimer after it that it's copyright 1986 the Lego Group, that's probably fine, especially since this looks to be an open source project, so you're not going to be charging people for something with their picture on it.<p>This page has what is very likely the original image: <a href=""http://www.peeron.com/scans/7823-1/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.peeron.com/scans/7823-1/</a>   Peeron.com has special permission directly from Lego to display the images, so if you wanted to be extra careful you could email dan@peeron.com and ask for permission to deep link to their picture (they'd probably say yes, the admin is a linux geek too). But honestly, a simple copyright disclaimer is probably fine. Lego won't reach out and swat you even if they do decide they don't like it, they'll just ask you to take it down.",1363809599

It's pretty obvious that without Darwin, there still would have eventually been a theory of evolution (as seen be Alfred Wallace's work), but Darwin gets credit for being first. Similarly, it's not at all obvious that without Dennis Ritchie, there would be no C. I'm sure <i>eventually</i> somebody would have created a similar language, but Ritchie made it happen first, so he deserves credit.<p>Sure, Intel may have eventually come up with ultra-efficient CPUs without Apple, but the point is that Apple helped make it happen.<p>To be clear, I'm not comparing a CPU design to the works of Darwin or Ritchie.

Having been through YC and TechStars (separate companies) and founding a crowdinvesting platform, it seems to me that early stage investing is very much about who you are and the relationships you've built. You can raise money and survive without significant traction a priori.<p>What's interesting to me is how the barrier for investing is being lowered (e.g. JOBS act) and how that's going to impact the dynamic of raising money. Startups are going to be able to find people in their industry who grok what they're doing (e.g. their customers) and raise small amounts of money from many people. It's going to be easier for investors to make more small bets ($1k instead of $50k), so I think the need for obvious traction early on (graphs going ""up and to the right"") is going to keep decreasing and it's going to be more about speaking to a niche of investors in your space and being great with product and communication.",1363809501
5409772,comment,5409549,5409549,2,0,mindcrime,,,"I think it matters, and I don't like Stuffak very much. Like somebody else said, it sounds like something you take when you have chest congestion or a sinus infection or something.<p>I would warn against being too attached to names that you come up with.  We all have a tendency to fall in love with our own ideas, and sometimes we need a 3rd party to tell us ""that's crap"".  To illustrate, let me share an anecdote from my own adventure:<p>We have 3 ""real"" projects that make up our product suite at the moment, and a fourth project that might or might not continue to exist as a standalone project.  All are Open Source and the projects are all named after light-houses.  All along we figured we'd eventually have a different name for the ""branded"" release, vs. the OSS project name... kinda like the way Fedora -> RHEL.  Anyway... we had the idea of an ""umbrella project"" to refer to the entire suite.   Since all our branding is based on light, illumination, light-houses, etc.<p>Company: Fogbeam Labs<p>Product 1: Quoddy (named after the West Quoddy Head Lighthouse in Maine)<p>Product 2: Heceta (named after the Heceta Head Lighthouse in Oregon)<p>Product 3: Neddick (named after the Cape Neddick ""Nubble"" Lighthouse in Maine)<p>Product 4: Hatteras (named after the Cape Hatteras Lighthouse in North Carolina)<p>So, when trying to come up with a name for the ""umbrella"" project, I had this bright (pun intended) idea to name it ""ScrewPile"" since screwpile[1] is a technical term related to lighthouses.<p>Brilliant, right?  Except...  like 3 people in the entire world actually <i>know</i> what ""screwpile"" means and would ""get"" the connection, and - even worse - if you <i>don't</i> know what it means, it just looks... ugly.  Almost vulgar, to be honest.<p>It took the VP of Sales from a former employer of mine calling me out on it, in no uncertain terms, to convince me to change it.  But once he really pulled the wool from over my eyes (wool <i>I</i> put there) it was dead obvious to me what as stupid name it was.<p>So, we renamed it Fogcutter and so far everybody is a lot happier with that. :-)<p>What's astonishing though, is the degree of rationalization and self-delusion I experienced before finally changing the name.  Hell, I <i>knew</i> it was a bad name in many ways, but I was convinced ""it isn't that bad"" and ""at least it's consistent with the other branding"", blah, blah, blah. None of which mattered in the least when we have a product name that sounds like it should be the name of a porn flick or maybe a personal lubricant. :-)<p>Stuffak might not be <i>as</i> bad, but my honest opinion is that you should change it.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screw-pile_lighthouse"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screw-pile_lighthouse</a>",1363809497

With respect to Adria's past and her sensitivity to the triggers she refers to, a comment like this is not demeaning to women and her reaction has nothing to do with supporting the future of this industry and the women who partake in it.

It has nothing to do with gender.<p>Taking the photo and posting it for her global audience was just too much. The appropriate course of action would have been to show the picture privately to staff and have them talk to the parties involved individually and maybe bring everyone together to talk about it after-the-fact.

5409736,comment,5391667,5409012,5,0,craftyPseudonym,,,"I say that rather than focusing on women's rights or men's rights, we as a society need to put more of an emphasis on equality overall, and making a concerted effort to eliminate sexism from <i>both</i> directions at the same time. In doing so it would help with the issue of the historically oppressed group B from rising to a point in which group A is now oppressed, as either a byproduct of the increase in rights or as revenge for their oppression. While men are oppressed in ways that many people fail to notice, and are expected to act in certain ways and exhibit ""manliness"", a men's rights movement is not the answer. What is needed is an individual rights movement, to allow everyone equal opportunity to do what they want and be who they are, so long as it does not infringe on anyone else's rights. When the focus is on gaining rights for a single group then typically that group will end up either above the other group(s) or it will remain lower, resulting in continued discontentment. If men fight for equal rights, while not equal they may still receive additional rights, but these may come at the cost of women not having these rights, and so the cycle repeats.",1363809239

The fact of the matter is this is simply not true, computer software cannot be equated to physical items, and barely equate to business flow and methods. With all the complexities, as well as the fact that to try out a new version of software happens in seconds where making a prototype of some machine or object takes days, weeks or months.

In order to just attend, you have to justify why you should and the organisers themselves how much worth you are to be within the crowd. Of course, this par for the course but it is a bit obtuse for me to see myself having to be judged by people who are good at pulling the heart strings of others and are capable of having a significant amount of Twitter followers. Do I need to have a high follower to followed ratio in order to be good enough?<p>It gets worse here of course because now TED (as in ""the TED"") has moved itself from Southern California to here in Vancouver. Everyone started to beat the drums and say that the city has become relevant once again since the Olympics, but of course everyone then fails to realise it's a $7,500 event that you have to buy into. Then again the cost for some tickets during the games did come close to that amount in some cases.<p>Some amazing stuff comes out of TED, but with the mayor and social media all getting excited about it, it's becomes apparent that this event is just a way for those who can go to wave their phalluses around as a sign of their ""status"" in the world.<p>TED can be a good thing but the way it is approached by those who are not speaking is just downright deplorable.",1363808174

The year I graduated with a Computer Information Systems degree was the year H1B visas ran out on the second day after their release. No way any company could have sponsored me that year. Still, because of the 8 years of tech experience I had, I got 3 offers and one company took me on a prayer I could still work for them after a year (a number of my non-tech classmates were not so lucky, some had to leave for London). Fortunately near the end of that year the OPT visas were extended for Engineering folks to 2+ years instead of 12  months, but it happened last minute and I had almost packed my bags by then. I had to go through the whole process after college and work in corporate engineering roles for 5 years before being able to jump out and start my own business. Ironically, I would start entrepreneurial initiatives at every company and team I worked for and some we ended up launching (you can block the entrepreneur visa, but you can't block the entrepreneur spirit I guess).

5409531,comment,5391667,5391667,2,0,ipsocannibal,,,"It seems from the comments from the individuals involved in the incident that the ""perpetrators"" of said offensive have been genuinely apologetic and remorseful.  While Ms. Richards although apologizing for the fact that one of the jokers lost their job has not really apologized for making this a big stink over social media.  I agree, if you have a concern use the Code of Conduct to your advantage or talk to them directly but why take their picture and post it on twitter with some vague description what you think they said if not to shame or humiliate them publicly.  Well, why would she apologize? Being a media personality, (that what she is, a tech PR person that gets in front of people and talks for a living, ignore the Tech. Evanglist BS), using social media effectively is probably integral to her business model.  If she admits that the original posting to twitter was uncalled for then its akin to saying she can't do part of her job in an ethical manner.  So what is she to do, double down of course.  Instead of being an adult and admitting she made a mistake as well, she needs to play the ""Joan of Arc"" card in order to garner more sympathy and divide the audience.  Sure she makes herself look like an asshole to some but doing it but at least she saves face with a lot of people she hopes to potentially sell her services to.  Instead she should admit that she got ticked off and decided to use her considerable PR skill to make an example out of two people.  Well guess what, pay back is a bitch.  I just checked your blog and it's down.  It seems cloudfire isn't helping you, and by the Out of memory error message that's returned, (which by the way, if you are a ""tech evangelist"" you should know is incredibly insecure to display error messages like that on a production website) it seems like that DDOS is working.  The internet is a double edged sword and it seems like it's swinging back her way.  From my point of view, this is the ultimate in fairness.  Her actions caused a person to lose their job, (I don't believe for a second that if she had not posted to twitter, if she had gone to the con staff or directly confronted the jokers, that anybody would have lost a job.) so she should lose an equivalent dollar amount in lost job opportunities and page views.",1363807288

I also remember CP/M came bundled with many Z-80-based computers of the time - there was not enough hardware standardization to allow shrink-wrapped cross-platform operating systems to exist.<p>> The other option on the IBM PC was UCSD p-system, which was fatally crippled by the overhead of the interpretation layer<p>UCSD p-system was cross-platform, at least.<p>> -- we didn't yet have JIT.<p>Or maybe we would have one by the late 80's<p>> multiple companies duking it out with incompatible OSes. How often does that work out?<p>We don't have enough data to make any accurate predictions. I suppose we may have arrived at a set of basic compatible APIs, much like POSIX, that allowed software designed for it to run on many different computers.<p>> I submit that the most likely scenario would've been a duopoly -- Apple with the home and education market, IBM with the business market.<p>And Commodore and Atari sharing the home/gaming market in the US, Acorn and Sinclair in the UK. Commodore would possibly own TV and special effects. 68K (or ARM) based 32-bit boxes would be considered basic home machines and the average person would have access to preemptive multitasking in the mid 80's.",1363806083

[Emphasis mine.] I then received a follow-up press release from the AGU also backing off the claim of Voyager leaving the solar system....

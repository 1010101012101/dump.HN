And I've always wanted the featureset that is now added to the web app, because it's really helpful for selling my own software. I added those features, not because I thought someone would like them, but because I wanted them for myself.<p>What feature do you think could be cut out? Maybe an outside perspective will make me see it differently.",1222264769

You should try to keep the main thing, the main thing. You said it was a to help developers sell/license their product. I think that is a fantastic tool and great market.<p>But your software seems to do a bit of everything. Why does it have to do project management, keep track of contacts and all sorts of other stuff. Why cant you just make it help track sales and licenses etc. That would be a compelling product, but right now there seems to be too much. So much that I just got overloaded and left the page. If you had two or three targeted tabs, I would have been a lot more interested.<p>Either way, great start and good luck!!",1222263657

When my hands are at rest but on top of the keyboard, that works out to about AEFV N[IK]L'.  It's a position not dissimilar to what you get on a split keyboard, but with the advantage that you can actually type this way.  The middle columns of keys (TGB and YHN) are typable with both hands.  Alt is left thumb only (I use the other Alt as an AltGr key; right thumb only).  Control is left pinky only, but pressed with the first knuckle, not the tip of the finger.",1222263085

Studies have shown that when we spend mental effort resisting something, we're more susceptible to the next thing that comes along. We simply don't have the luxury of being rational all the time. And if you think we can, then I submit you're underestimating just how irrational we are most of the time.<p>My take, I think, is that of a pragmatist.

Passing by the post hoc ergo propter hoc nature of the argument, it doesn't allow for human diversity. Humans are very diverse, some of thrive in small bands, and some of us thrive in huge hierarchical organizations. There is no ""one"" human nature. Look at reproductive strategies: harems, polygamy, polyandry, monogamy, serial monogamy, celibacy, all touted as by one group or another as the one true, natural, reproductive strategy for humans. You could argue that the evolution has best fit us to live in tropical savannas, but the Inuit, Lapps, and Siberians would take it very much amiss if you told them they should abandon the arctic because humans had not evolved to live there. Evolutionary biology does not   consist of telling ""just so"" stories to explain the virtues of your tribe.",1206165574

Just like you can&#x27;t train people to be star athletes.  Except you can.  Star athletes get free college tuition.  Star college athletes get sent to training camps and minor leagues where they get paid and are trained on their game so they can make it to the professionals.  They go through training there as well.<p>A tuition free university, University of Helsinki, is what Linux came out of.  Free CS classes.  A star was trained there.<p>The mentality of &quot;you can&#x27;t train stars&quot; is bogus...it&#x27;s more &quot;we don&#x27;t want to invest anything and want everything handed to us free and easy, and if we don&#x27;t get it that way we&#x27;ll complain about a shortage of stars&quot;<p>It&#x27;s great that it&#x27;s been deduced that organizer labor is behind this article, and thus it&#x27;s not neutral and has a hidden agenda.  I&#x27;m sure someone who takes a 6% stake of high-growth companies for $14,000 is completely neutral with no hidden agenda.  Also it&#x27;s false that &quot;none of these programmers are unionized&quot;.

6099996,comment,6099285,6099505,4,0,WildUtah,,,"Big high tech companies with open positions for stars would benefit most from a bidding system for a fixed number of visas. That way, the companies that really need top people could just pay enough cash to get a visa and be assured of having one available. The whole system could operate much faster, too.<p>But what&#x27;s being proposed is a vast expansion in the number if visas available. Most of the new ones will go to the same mediocre outsourcing company drones that fill the current quotas.<p>It&#x27;s just an expansion of the current system that rewards blizzards of similar applications from cheap workers with faked credentials. (Or credentials that document some kind of educations and experience without reflecting any talent)<p>A bidding system would wipe out those drones in favor of American workers. Meanwhile, everyone who needs stars would get them. Of course, bidding hasn&#x27;t been on the table since the early 1990&#x27;s. Republicans were inalterably opposed to it then because it would support middle class wages and Democrats oppose it now because they expect a mass of immigrants to eventually vote for them.",1374710043

It&#x27;s not an optimized Helvetica, it&#x27;s a generic looking franken-Grotesque that was billed as a low-rent Helvetica. And that&#x27;s pretty much what it is.<p>Some of the other &#x27;Microsoft core fonts&#x27; (Arial was originally designed by Monotype in 1982, not Microsoft) <i>were</i> actually designed for low resolution screen display, like Georgia and Verdana. Arial is better hinted than some of the versions of Helvetica out there, especially some of the lousy ones more common to older PCs. It has a high x-height and was designed to be readable at smaller sizesin print. But so was Helvetica.<p>In fact, one of the virtues of Helvetica is that it&#x27;s pretty legible as body text. Like any typeface, it can be abused, but it&#x27;s not a crime to use it for body copy. Just make sure not to track it too tightly.<p>As high resolution displays become more commonplace, concerns about hinted type should lessen. And having to design fat, wide letters for crude raster grids will hopefully become a thing of the pastlike old terminal displays.<p>One last thing: Helvetica&#x27;s a pretty sweet looking typeface; contrary to its reputation, not at all &#x27;neutral&#x27;, it has midcentury charm and character without looking too dated.

Chiropractic medicine for anything other than lower back pain and Acupuncture are two forms of alternative medicine that are well known to work off the placebo effect, yet the article mentions their use despite alleging to be a skeptic. This is a major red flag.<p>There is not a large amount of unbiased information about Dr Sarno&#x27;s methods that I could find quickly, but from what is available TMS appears to be a form of alternative medicine that has no basis in science, and instead relies on pseudoscience and the placebo effect.<p>Rather than the pain relief being due to TMS, there is probably a more likely cause behind the result. Perhaps stretching exercises or pain medicine was involved. Or perhaps even just the placebo effect itself.<p>Please read this article for more information.

Because Mr. Hayden is so crucially aware of how improbable it is for anyone to keep anything secret at all anymore, he&#x27;s only worried about people&#x27;s misplaced confidence in secrecy being rationalized. The IC banks on people&#x27;s impression that secrecy is still practical, but certainly once you realize that if the people most aware of the porous nature of data networks can&#x27;t even stop their secure side documents from leaking en masse nobody less focused will consider their documents private.<p>It&#x27;s a classic double edged sword - the intelligence community had been the primary driver of innovation in computer and network defense strategies. But somewhere between the beginning and the end of the development of TPM they decided that insecure computers were so valuable as an asset that it couldn&#x27;t be risked that they might fund research that might accidentally result in some real level of defense.<p>If general Alexander spent a tenth the money on defense as he does on offensive teams and research and bugs maybe they&#x27;d actually have more advanced strategies than air gap and pray. But once the basic judgement was made that software quality issues appeared to make computer security np complete they basically gave up on the problem. Thus began the race to exploit and backdoor the world that we took an early lead in but has lead to a lot of blowback when not everyone was as concerned as we were with not sharing the benefits with private industry. Now the big states know more or less everything about each other, while US multinationals essentially have to horse trade for even basic information sharing about active intrusions on their networks.

You can wear whatever you want and it&#x27;s on you whether or not &#x27;you wear it well.&#x27;<p>As an aside, when i was in grad school, the style coming out of yale and the werkplaats typografie was this severely default design aesthetic. Times new roman massively overlaid atop a xeroxed image at times abandoning legibility. It was like high-art zine culture blended with dutch sensibility, i.e. <a href=""http://ffffound.com/image/d6f63117fcf5ea64c59c66b8af85e2389d27adb3?c=3269722"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ffffound.com/image/d6f63117fcf5ea64c59c66b8af85e2389d...</a><p>But to the point about what makes arial &quot;good&quot; or &quot;bad&quot; is the same thing that makes Didot a bit tough as a text face (it just wasn&#x27;t designed to be used that way). And same with arial, it was designed as a screen font that prints ok. I don&#x27;t think the whole &quot;lesser helveltica&quot; claim is entirely fair to arial, but you have to accept it for what it&#x27;s for: a generic screen font. If that is the look you are hoping to rock, use it wherever you want.<p>And to the larger point: all prescriptive advice should be treated like training wheels. if you already have the sense to know what you&#x27;re doing, you can safely avoid the advice. if you don&#x27;t know how to critique your own work, then it helps to think about what the prescriptive advice is getting you to avoid.<p>If you are at the point where you are making <i>intentional</i> decisions about what your design should look like, then keep on keeping on. But it helps to be aware of the cultural baggage that those choices bring along with them. I critted somebody&#x27;s poster once and made the offhand comment: &quot;oh, that looks computery&quot; and i was basically trying to say &quot;that has that homemade camcorder feel that home movies have, but if it were a poster that had been made with a computer.&quot; and it turned out after some period of time that i was actually reacting, subconsciously, to the fact that it was set with arial. How weird is that? But it was because i was so familiar with that look as <i>something that tasted digital</i> that is seemed weird in print. It wasn&#x27;t wrong, it was just giving off that vibe.<p>Likewise, butterick is trying to make his own mark, setting his own tone.

Ironically it may well be that not having the slaves at all could have prevented the outage.<p>I&#x27;ve seen other scenarios in the past where having a (mysql) master-slave arrangement has caused an outage.

The fallacy is, the TCP connection is not really important to the shared state of two devices.  From the very beginning (I&#x27;m talking 1970s!), devices should have been using tokens to identify one another, regardless of communication status.  The tokens could be saved in nonvolatile memory on servers so that jobs could always continue where they left off.<p>Instead we have a whole slew of nondeterministic pathological cases -exactly- like the one that hit Twilio.  If you take on the burden of timeouts, you end up with dozens of places in your code (even more, potentially) where you just don&#x27;t know what to do if you lose communication.<p>If you don&#x27;t take on the burden of timeouts, then you can just track each connection and all it costs you is storage space, which is practically free today and getting cheaper every year.  With credentials from the client, you don&#x27;t even have to worry about duplicate connections.  You can write your client-server code deterministically and stick to the logic, and easily stress test failure modes.",1374708646

What percentage of engineers that aren&#x27;t founders or within the first five employees make over $300,000 a year? The money is in Silicon Valley, Google&#x27;s 2011 net income was $299,874/employee [1], but the vast majority of engineers aren&#x27;t going to be the ones to get it.<p>How about paying a market wage, instead of offering a &quot;free lunch&quot; to people that cannot negotiate. I am not interested in playing video games at work, I have a house for that. Last I looked at it, the difference in pay between finance and stem jobs is enough to hire a personal chef to deliver lunch to you at work every day, and cook for you at home, and buy all the games you want, with a bunch of money left over. Apple and Google are both posting ~25% net profits because engineers are willing to work for peanuts, and a free lunch.  On top of that, cost of living in the bay area is outrageous, we&#x27;re talking $35,000/year for housing, unless you want to live like a college student.<p>An average (median) engineer should be making $200,000 a year, and the &quot;rockstar&quot; (>80th percentile) engineers that everybody is trying to hire for $85,000 and 0.5% of equity, should be making $350,000+. These are hard jobs that few people can do at all, and fewer can do well. Great engineers can create millions of dollars of value a year.<p>It seems that the industry has shifted focus, now that the collusion agreements have been squashed, toward importing cheap labor.  This problem has been solved in other industries through partnerships and professional societies (e.g. in the legal industry, with large partnership firms and bar associations).  In the interim, it seems like the best way to capture value is to build companies to flip in talent acquisitions, while planning to leave to do it again as soon as you&#x27;re vested.<p>[1] Goldman Sachs 2011 net income was $162,913 per employee. Average pay was $367,057. It&#x27;s harder to get data on Google, but it looks like the mid-career median salary is $141,000.<p>Google&#x27;s Gross Profit (Total Revenue less Cost of Revenue) was $24.7B in 2011, and GS&#x27;s was $24.5B. At the same time, Google had 32,467 employees to GS&#x27;s 35,700. Yet, the Google net income was $9.7B compared to $4.4B on the GS side.

6099773,comment,6099196,6099196,1,0,andrewSC,,,"I&#x27;m a &quot;junior developer&quot; (and first time poster!) who is about to graduate with a degree in CS and have a little over a year&#x27;s worth of internship experience both at a medium/large (1500-2000 employees at HQ) and small/startup (~70 employees) sized company. As I apply to a number of companies I&#x27;m interested in working for it still surprises me that the majority of these listings for dev&#x27;s are asking for 3+ years or 5+ years experience. Now I completely and whole-heartedly agree that if the job description mentioned something ridiculous (we need you to create custom SOAP requests using haskell) then perhaps the experience is merited. But when I actually reach out to the companies asking for 3+ years experience and ask what they&#x27;re trying to accomplish in the immediate future, where they need additional developers (i.e. what team is this for), etc. I&#x27;m surprised to hear it&#x27;s nothing unusual. There might be the need to occasionally do packet inspection (or something else semi-uncommon) for debugging or what have you but is this really beyond me and my peers? It might be beyond some, and while I can&#x27;t speak for all the junior dev&#x27;s out there, I personally am comfortable enough to do this on my own.<p>Now please correct me if I&#x27;m wrong but basically it comes down to this: if I were the hiring manager I wouldn&#x27;t focus so much on the number of years the dev has but rather if that dev &quot;still has it&quot; (if they&#x27;re older/more experienced). By &quot;still has it&quot; I mean a genuine passion for writing solid code and being humble enough to know when they&#x27;re wrong and changing their behavior. If it&#x27;s a younger dev maybe it&#x27;s best to focus on trying to determine if they have a genuine interest in becoming a better programmer and a real thirst for knowledge/love to learn (in-line with the article). My only gripe with the latter point are <i>how</i> some of these companies are filtering but that&#x27;s entirely their choice.",1374707391

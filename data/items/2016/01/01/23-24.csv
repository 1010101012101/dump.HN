In concert with LE&#x27;s newfound prowess would be a subtle but pervasive mass media campaign that targets pre-criminals with cautionary tales of the apprehended.

10824218,comment,10821448,10823071,0,0,iheartmemcache,,,"Kind of sort of. The way the Vegas books are made are to make consistent profit while mitigating as much risk as possible. Which means, although not quite like the zero-sum markets which exist in securities, you still have to have more or less need the scales to weigh out.<p>What you can capitalize on is human emotional -- i.e. the Dallas Cowboys are notorious for being bet heavily in favor of, even if statistically they&#x27;re not going to win because of sentiment or what-not. Let&#x27;s say statistically they&#x27;re underdogs by 10.5 pts. Let&#x27;s not talk about covering the spread or parlays or anything complicated - just pretend the market is limited to solely &#x27;bet to win&#x27;. If it were the Bengals as the underdog at the same 10.5 against the Raiders (just teams where the fan base doesn&#x27;t skew the book), you might see -170 to win 100 , and conversely if the Raiders win, it might be bet +140 to win 100. (I haven&#x27;t bet on sports in years, so I&#x27;m not sure how the actual numerics work out). Either way, as underdogs, since so many people will be betting on the Cowboys even though they&#x27;re predicted to lose by greater than 10.5, the line will only be at -120 due to the volume of bets being taken. Vegas has to move the line accordingly to adjust for the contingency that the Cowboys actually <i>do</i> win, paying out 170 on those upsets could bankrupt them.<p>Being successful at fantasy sports is probably a lot easier than being successful at trading crude oil, because John and his buddies will all throw down 40 bucks each for the Cowboys to win even though the odds are heavily skewed against them. And unlike in Vegas, you can consistently be profitable and not get black-listed. (Counting cards should be legal if you are not colluding with anyone, but I digress).<p>Interestingly enough, &#x27;betting schemes&#x27; might not work for the average player, but there&#x27;s a reason why the same  10 players make it to the final table of the World Series of Poker. In fact that&#x27;s how those daily betting fantasy poker gaming sites are in business. It doesn&#x27;t violate the unlawful gaming act because games like poker[1] and fantasy football clearly have consistent winners and losers, even though those attributes often can&#x27;t be quantified via any sort of metric, it&#x27;s enough for judges to rule that certain forms of gambling are games of skill.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.npr.org/2012/08/22/159833145/judge-rules-poker-is-a-game-of-skill-not-luck"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.npr.org/2012/08/22/159833145/judge-rules-poker-is...</a> I&#x27;ve seen the same ruling at the highest circuit of tons of states, and I&#x27;m guessing it must be federally recognized as the fantasy daily line-up games are making literally billions off it now.",1451692696

Now in those days the god Thamus was the king of the whole country of Egypt; and he dwelt in that great city of Upper Egypt which the Hellenes call Egyptian Thebes, and the god himself is called by them Ammon. To him came Theuth and showed his inventions, desiring that the other Egyptians might be allowed to have the benefit of them; he enumerated them, and Thamus enquired about their several uses, and praised some of them and censured others, as he approved or disapproved of them. It would take a long time to repeat all that Thamus said to Theuth in praise or blame of the various arts. But when they came to letters, This, said Theuth, will make the Egyptians wiser and give them better memories; it is a specific both for the memory and for the wit. Thamus replied: O most ingenious Theuth, the parent or inventor of an art is not always the best judge of the utility or inutility of his own inventions to the users of them. And in this instance, you who are the father of letters, from a paternal love of your own children have been led to attribute to them a quality which they cannot have; for <i>this discovery of yours will create forgetfulness in the learners&#x27; souls, because they will not use their memories; they will trust to the external written characters and not remember of themselves.</i> The specific which you have discovered is an aid not to memory, but to reminiscence, and you give your disciples not truth, but only the semblance of truth; they will be hearers of many things and will have learned nothing; they will appear to be omniscient and will generally know nothing; they will be tiresome company, having the show of wisdom without the reality.",1451692630

Much like with all the other cases, this idea is somewhere between confused and blatant denial of reality.<p>Money is the unit of caring. The amount of money that you&#x27;re willing to spend on something is how much you care about having it, as precisely defined by the point at which it&#x27;s too expensive and you don&#x27;t care enough to pay that much. The factory farms are big and wealthy because they provide what people care about: an efficiently produced, consistent solution to the problem of what to have for dinner.<p>If people really cared about their food coming from small, inefficient, &quot;organic&quot; farms then they would pay for what it really costs to produce food in that manner. The fact that people aren&#x27;t willing to pay for it tells us that they don&#x27;t actually care as much as they claimed. This is normal: most people will tell you they care deeply about something up until the point when you ask them to open their wallet, and then they remember that they don&#x27;t care all that much.<p>It seems to me that what&#x27;s really wanted here is better factory farms with modest adjustments to reduce pollution, antibiotics use, and improve animal welfare. That&#x27;s entirely achievable. It won&#x27;t be achieved by things like this article; it&#x27;ll be achieved by somebody who sets out to make a better factory farm and builds a business around that.<p>This is already happening. <a href=""http://spread.co.jp/en/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://spread.co.jp/en/</a> plan to have what could be a game-changing approach to vegetable farming up and running in 2017.

While there is a minimum viable farm size (given the need for modern machinery to automate the process), most likely, it probably isn&#x27;t nearly as large as what our current set of incentives enforces. And, historically, there were farming coops that made it possible for communities of farmers to share expenses for those tools (and some states and communities still have legal infrastructure and such to enable those kinds of organizations), but federal policy and mega-store purchasing policy makes it a moot point.<p>There&#x27;s a lot more to the story of what our agricultural system looks like, and this article only touches on it from one personal, anecdotal, perspective, but it&#x27;s simplistic to dismiss this perspective and the concerns it raises about our food supply. Michael Pollan has been writing compellingly on the subject for many years, and I recommend you check out <i>The Omnivore&#x27;s Dilemma</i> and <i>In Defense of Food</i>. They provide a well-research view of why things are so skewed in our food system, and why that is dangerous to our current and future health.<p><i>&quot;If they&#x27;re truly in demand, one would expect wages or profits to signal that.&quot;</i><p>On that point, we&#x27;re agreed...there has to be a way to correct the incentives so that a competitive agriculture market can exist, given the fact that we all need to eat, and ethically speaking, it&#x27;d be good if the most affordable foods were among the most healthy and least damaging to the environment. That&#x27;s not the way things are incentivized currently. As it stands, there&#x27;s a strong cartel of very large farms and animal agriculture companies that stack the deck in their favor. It isn&#x27;t merely a story of efficiency of scale, it also includes lobbying, anti-competitive practices, etc.",1451689917

10823928,comment,10822132,10823390,0,0,viscanti,,,"> Hint -- think about the really good (US-born) software engineers in SF you know. How many grew up in dense urban areas? Barely any, I&#x27;m willing to bet. Most are from the middle-class &#x27;burbs, and didn&#x27;t go to decrepit urban schools.<p>This might miss the larger trend. Most 20-30 somethings in the US grew up in the suburbs because there was a larger movement to the suburbs at that time. The fact that things worked out well then, doesn&#x27;t mean that&#x27;s always the optimal strategy. It only tells us what a potentially successful path was in the 80s and 90s.<p>As cities become more desirable, and as housing prices there increase, the reasons for moving to the burbs shrink. Ignoring the demographic shift back to cities is a mistake. Correlation from what seemed to work in the 80s and 90s isn&#x27;t necessarily causation or correlation in a world that has changed.",1451689267

How do they think they can possibly compete against huge factory farms? I can understand if you&#x27;re doing a small farm &#x27;for fun&#x27;, but don&#x27;t understand how an otherwise intelligent person can think they can (or should be able to) make good money from it.<p>> As the average age of the American farmer neared 65, I knew young farmers were badly needed in this country.<p>If they&#x27;re truly in demand, one would expect wages or profits to signal that.<p>> none of these things address the policies that dictate how our country’s food system works, policies that have created a society in which the small farmer can’t even earn a living.<p>Some of the policies might not help, but the fundamental reason small farms can&#x27;t compete is that farming has large economies of scale. Some people may be able to find a niche charging high prices for uncommon goods, but that&#x27;s never going to be the bulk of the industry.

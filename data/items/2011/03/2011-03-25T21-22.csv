Having said that, we all know that's not <i>always</i> true...there's a looooong list of ideas that were so brilliant at the time of their inception that - combined with good fortune and perfect timing - the initial crappy implementation had no real negative impact (hello, Windows 3.0, hello Facemash, etc.).<p>So your idea may be brilliant...probably not, but maybe so :-)  If you have already prototyped it out, have a basic wireframe built, have a good business plan in place, and have some funding lined up (either your own or from some external source) I would say that a technical co-founder would be <i>at most</i> worth 20-25%.  From the gist of your question, though, it sounds like you have an idea in your head and that's about it.  If that's the case, you gotta find your co-founder and immediately agree to a 50/50 split...maybe give them a 6-8 week 'trial phase' just to make sure they aren't a total fruitcake and are going to bail out on you, then lock it all down legally and move forward from there.<p>What people are trying to tell you in the other posts is that HARD skills >> SOFT skills when it comes to launching a tech company in the very early stages.  Look at your descriptions:<p>* ""business-minded"" - hard to quantify\n* ""action-oriented"" - every great developer on earth is this as well\n* ""team-building"" - if you were great at this, your first stop wouldn't be at Hacker News for advice on how to build a team\n* ""selling"" - I agree that this is actually a HARD skill - either you got it or you don't.  If you have demonstrated track record in this area, this is your trump card.\n* ""partnerships"" - soft skill...mostly manipulating paperwork with lawyers at the end of the day\n* ""strategy"" - you will easily be splitting this one 50/50 with your technical co-founder<p>Meanwhile, a good tech co-founder is going to bring:<p>* Specific dev experience - hard skill\n* Knowledge of architecture and scalability - hard skill\n* Knowledge of SEO and online technical marketing - hard skill\n* Ability to augment his/her skill with other good tech people out there, selecting from their own personal experience or interviewing based on their own skills - hard skill (i.e. business guy has no hope of locating and finding these people, IMHO)<p>Sorry for the long explanation.

2370434,comment,2368658,2370303,3,0,stellal,,,"Very good points.  I wrote the article and have struggled a lot with how <i>right</i> node is as a general purpose tool.  My interim conclusion, for many of the reasons you point out, is that to the extent that it can be made relatively safe, it is a good tool for those situations where my other choice would have been to write a massively scalable, non-blocking C program.  This class of problems does not come up every day, but it is coming up more and more as the web and mobile arena move to more of a fully connected mesh of clients and the switchboards that arbitrate their exchanges need to become more flexible and efficient.<p>On the flip side, building massively scalable systems based on blocking IO is rife with problems and I've found that enforcing architectures that make it manageable have a way of obscuring the code and making it difficult for people to intuitively get right as well.  I personally find the explicit functional style to be just as intuitive as structured and/or OO and therefore find that when I need it, a platform like node that makes the knife's edge that is asynchronous programming explicit and manageable with a good functional style is a good trade-off in the world where I am trying to find less bad options to a hard problem.<p>Sometimes you have to step back 20 years in order to break through the layers of assumptions that were added in the interim.  I doubt node is the last word on the topic, but it is a refreshing interlude to what was becoming an unwieldy calcification of the theory of how to program computers.  The water will find the right course eventually as we experiment with the different styles.",1301088716

When the tech advances to a point where downloading build files + materials cost is comparable to the cost of transporting cheap goods from China we will see mass adoption. The cost of importing from China is heavily subsidized by cheap oil transportation fuels. That being said, I see a bright future for instafab technology and the resulting products.

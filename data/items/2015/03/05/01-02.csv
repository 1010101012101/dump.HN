9148779,comment,9144552,9148668,0,0,pbz,,,"No, that would be too much for a DID patient and could lead to further splitting (creation of new parts). First step is to teach them to stay grounded, to stay present and not take the easy path and dissociate (i.e. go away). When struggling to stay present someone with DID may exhibit OCD patterns -- scratching, grabbing, fiddling with fingers etc. -- all without realizing. However, when this happens there&#x27;s usually some level of co-consciousness with a part that is suffering or has OCD. So in this case the OCD behavior would &quot;belong&quot; to that part while some other part is &quot;out&quot; (they&#x27;d actually both be &quot;out&quot; at the same time). It&#x27;s a very complex disorder.",1425520725

But that&#x27;s exactly why we have a proliferation of VCs and startups and a &#x27;shortage&#x27; of engineers willing to work for them. The classic argument for liquidation preference is because VCs are putting up  money, but so is the engineer if he&#x27;s taking a salary cut, and the only reason you find it ridiculous that I suggest engineers get preferred stock is because you are stuck in an old school mindset where financial professionals are in charge, and they loop in a few chosen engineers (founders) to bamboozle the rest into bad deals, and &quot;work hard because we&#x27;re a startup and have ping-pong tables&quot;.  Not surprisingly, you are VP of engineering and trying to hire, so you&#x27;re invested in the status quo that rewards founders and VCs. I think the echo chamber has made startups so &#x27;cool&#x27; that I decided to bet against the herd mentality and get a good deal from a big tech company. I&#x27;d love to re-enter the startup industry at some point in the distant future, I just want to challenge the status quo and see an arrangement where engineers are actually partners and true, first-class owners. If this scares away some VC money, good, there are a lot of questionable startups out there already, it would be better for the industry as a whole if some of these startup engineers started collaborating instead of every single one needing to be founder or at least VP of engineering, because the only engineers willing to work for less than that are naive or inexperienced.",1425520553

Challenges/verifications don&#x27;t have to happen all that often ([1] indicates they are looking at once a month) so creating a unique challenge for each user shouldn&#x27;t be too compute intensive.<p>For each known user:<p>- Central server chooses random chunk of each file it wishes to verify the user still has. This could be any length from as long as the hash function to the whole file size and could be offset any number of bits.<p>- Client is asked to provide the hash of the chunk using the file stored locally.<p>Precomputing hashes for all possible chunk permutations would take up substantially more space than simply storing the file in the first place. A bad actor would need to store the hash for all the possible chunk lengths starting from every possible start location in the file which is in the order of O(n^2) where n is the stored file size (500GB in this case).

To be exact, I live in the East Side in whats known as a barrio/ghetto/hood. If you google Fearnowville Colorado you&#x27;ll see my home. I also have a LOT of experience in hospitality and F&B and have had regular personal contact with a wide variety of immigrants. My homie Santos is an illegal from Neuvo Leon. Marianna grew up in Sonora. When I was 18 I went to prison for drug charges and made real friendships with mexican and american criminals of all stripes. I learned about ejidos, jesus malverde, mis animales, and I am intelligent. Now don&#x27;t get me wrong, I&#x27;m clean and totally legit. I got kids and I don&#x27;t roll with gangsters. I am respected by my peers and I earned that respect. So that&#x27;s where I&#x27;m coming from. Now I gotta say you don&#x27;t know much more about being a criminal than I do about Haskell. People DO disappear, and it happens a LOT. Here and there both. Here in my small southwestern town of 100,000 I can think of multiple black baggings.... once in the parking lot of a walmart, even. I know there&#x27;s stats about Mexico DF that look good, but you believe the Mexican feds?<p>Personal anecdote: my wifes grandpa was a man named Jan Bonte. He was born in .dk, his dad was killed by nazis and he was placed in a camp. He immigrated after the war, first to .nl where he met and married his wife, and then to the US. They had a family in Colorado and after a late-life divorce he moved to Kino in the Sonoran desert for winters and came back to Colorado for summers. Because he routinely crossed the border he was ordered to mule something, and he declined. After a month of no contact we received news he died. We went to clean his remains from his house, which was gruesome after spending October in the sonoran heat after being chopped up by an axe.<p>Day 1 a duece n half came up with a gaggle of Mexican troops. Green uniforms, M-16s, idk if they were cops or &#x27;cops&#x27; or what, but they gave us 3 days to gtfo.<p>Day 2, we picked up his ashes and had a small ceremony. He had local friends, who told us what happened and who did it.<p>Day 3, we were on the road<p>I put so many personal details because seriously: dox it if you&#x27;d like. You&#x27;ll see Jan isn&#x27;t counted among the victims of the drug war but it doesn&#x27;t matter. The important thing is &quot;this is how it is&quot; and to hope it never happens to me or mine. Aqui hubo una mano negra<p>I don&#x27;t have a point at all, I just feel I see/know an entirely different world from the average HN poster.

More than 275 companies went public to raise more than $85B. In 2000, 406 companies raised about $96 billion. So sure, last year, there were fewer IPOs and they were on average larger than 2014. But this is not a sign of over-regulation.<p>Heavy SEC regulations did not crush IPOs for SMBs. That&#x27;s a knee-jerk blame government reaction that conveniently ignores the real reason why IPO-able companies don&#x27;t go public much any more. They don&#x27;t need to.<p>Uber is a good example. Their Series E is coming in at over a billion. Historically, they would have had to turn to public markets for that money.<p>But the JOBS Act actually made it possible for private companies to stay private a lot longer, because they are no longer penalized for granting stock to their employees, for example.<p>Personally, I would overjoyed if it was impossible to sell crappy private companies&#x27; shares. That would limit the damage to the rest of the economy, but sadly that&#x27;s actually not the case. SecondMarket, Exhilway private capital market, Campbell Lutyens, Cogent Partners, Probitas Ps and Triago all serve the secondary market for shares of private companies.<p>If Cuban can&#x27;t find a greater fool to snap up his shares, he&#x27;s doing something wrong. There are plenty of venues to offload that stuff.<p>Cuban also seems to misunderstand liquidity in public markets. Just because a company is listed on a public exchange doesn&#x27;t mean its shares are liquid. There are many listed companies that see very little trading in their shares on any given day. And if their valuation tanked, for whatever reason, that limited liquidity would evaporate altogether.<p>During the 2008 crisis, it was impossible to unload many companies&#x27; shares without making the price tumble.

(The book was never released, but you can read it here: <a href=""https://web.archive.org/web/20080414161145/http://www.roxie.org/books/shoulders/fullbook.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https://web.archive.org/web/20080414161145/http://www.roxie....</a>)<p>That book made me realize that scientific revolutions and financial revolutions go on at the same time.  This is because when a new mathematical framework is discovered, scientists use it to reveal nature (which improves labor), and finance uses it to reveal human nature. (which improves influence)  Therefore, TWO bubbles exist in parallel:<p>- The assumption that future labor will be better organized (through science)<p>- The assumption that better organization will yield greater influence (through finance)<p>Those bubbles eventually drift, but they can re-synchronize, and right now, finance has outpaced science.  Considerably.  Smart money is keeping liquidity on the sidelines and awaiting a resynching event: Either finance tones it down or science invents new math.<p>Here&#x27;s a gem from the book:<p>&quot;After the war, the same crisis of confidence came as after the last one, the same blame game started, the same things happened. As usual, we relabeled our own past. Once again we found ways to blame it on someone, and therefore disown it as an event. It was ‘long ago.’ We’re different today though, aren’t we? Such things could never happen again, or so we tell ourselves. On the other hand, the above forecast of 2040 can’t possibly be right. No public forecast can be. Even were it to have proved accurate, had it been kept secret, once published its existence would change our future. Most of us would ignore it, as we ignore most things. But if it strikes a nerve, some of us might work hard to bring it about. Others of us might work equally hard to stop it from happening. Whoever wins, the resulting future won’t be the same as the forecast had stated it would be. No forecast can predict its own effect. It can’t predict how many of us will either fight it or push it, nor how many of us will try to predict how many of us will fight or push and try to profit from that, nor how many of us will try to predict how many of us will try to profit, and thus profit from that. Pattern recognition leads to pattern exploitation. Thus, a public forecast can come true only if none of us cares about it. In other words, our only useful predictions are our predictably useless ones. Call it Gödel’s Inanity Theorem.&quot;",1425518700

Especially with the rise of Fat Acceptance-style lobby groups there is increasing pressure (alongside existing industrial sugar sellers like drink makers) to push back on the idea that a variety of health problems are obesity-related, or to tell people they need to change exercise/dietary habits.<p>In a way, it&#x27;s quite impressive.  They&#x27;re doing much better than the pro-smoking lobby ever did, but it&#x27;s also rather depressing from a public policy point of view.<p>As a corollary it&#x27;s worth noting that if e.g. your workplace demands you work hours that effectively preclude you eating and exercising well there are substantial costs, not just for you, but for society more broadly.",1425517935

But my point was the price is unlikely to stay down... Anyway this debate of whether the price will go down or up is a little silly: even assuming the price stays down it will literally take DECADES for the network to &quot;need&quot; to increase the tx/block by 250x to maintain the same level of security. The bitcoin reward is halved every ~4 years, so we only need the tx/block to double every ~4 years to maintain the same level of security. So far Bitcoin as MORE than met this need: the tx/block has more than doubled every year since its creation.<p>> I didn&#x27;t say this is necessarily the end of bitcoin<p>You were saying you did not believe the price drop would stop. Now you are saying it will quite likely stagnate. That&#x27;s quite a different statement.<p>> It&#x27;s just that the raw numbers which we do have show that it&#x27;s not really doing that well.\n> [...]\n> The fact that only hard numbers which we do have show poor adoption indicates that it&#x27;s the same elsewhere.<p>Yes we know that for merchants accepting Bitcoin, it represents an incredibly tiny fraction of their total sales. But why do you think this means Bitcoin is not doing well? A brand new payment technology unlike anything else going from zero to representing 0.1% of the sales of 100,000 merchants worldwide is a significant accomplishment in my opinion. I say 0.1% because 0.x% seems to be approximately what the average merchant reports. For example Overstock reported 0.2% of their sale revenues were in bitcoins for 2014.<p>Also why do you extrapolate your single anecdote (WordPress shutting down Bitcoin sales) to an industry-wide trend? Why do you ignore 3 other anecdotes that contradict your opinion (Overstock consistently doing 0.2% of their sales in bitcoins = $3 million/year so they are far from stopping to accept bitcoin, Newegg reporting their best bitcoin black friday sales in 2014, Gyft reporting the same)? Why do these 4 anecdotes, whether positive or negative, matter at all, when I showed you more indirect metrics (avc.com) that obviously show strong overall adoption? The avc.com metrics may not show actual bitcoin sales figures, but clearly they indicate something.<p>To answer your question: I think BitPay and Coinbase don&#x27;t release current numbers of Bitcoin payments processed because this is sensitive financial data for competitors. But surely VCs wouldn&#x27;t be pouring tens of millions of dollars in them if they showed no growth, don&#x27;t you think?",1425517594

Some large fraction of software development is done in-house; closed platforms wouldn't allow this, and it's expensive enough that if it wasn't important it probably wouldn't be done now. In the past, sufficiently useful software has come with a bundled computer; if this had to be done regularly, <i>someone</i> would see an opportunity to sell an open computer that could run more than one kind of software.",1264679485

Not directly because of the success of closed platforms but because this success may allow regulation to happen without too many people complaining.<p>I have an actual example: how web mail harms me, even when I am not using it.  Web mail is pervasive. The direct result was that many ISPs felt they could block the outgoing SMTP port (to stop evil spam).

4523038,comment,4520981,4521564,1,0,ericmoritz,,,"Erlang's error handling is very well thought out.  In fact, error handling is the main reason Erlang is shaped the way it is.<p>It is a combination of Go's technique but with panics for exceptional errors.<p>Like Go, functions should return error values for known errors.  For instance, `file:open/2` returns `{error, enoent | eacces | eisdir | enotdir | enospc}` for known error conditions that can be handled.  Unknown, exceptional conditions, like a NAS going down, can't be compensated for because the set of unknown errors is unbounded.  There could literally be an infinite number of things that can go wrong that you don't know how to handle. For try/catch style error handling, the only safe way to handle the unknown errors is to do a Pokemon catch clause globally or around every single potentially error causing function call.<p>Because of the fact that you can't stop errors from happening is why Erlang has processes.  When an unknown error occurs, the individual process dies and anyone monitoring that process is notified.   OTP has supervisors whose sole job is to watch over processes and restart them if they crash.<p>Any state that needs to be preserved between restarts is stored somewhere safe (Erlangers calls this the ""error kernel"") so that when the process comes back it'll resume where it left off.<p>Once you structure your code to ""Let it Crash"", your code gets much simpler and safer. #1, the error return values forces you to compensate for known errors that can happen with a function, #2 you have to think about data durability in order to ""Let it Crash"". #3 Supervisors take care of the rest.<p>Data durability is made much easier with the fact that individual processes are single threaded and data is immutable, this makes them transactional by nature.",1347645576

Usually they just rename a couple of variables and reformat things a bit. A former professor of mine wrote a program to ""fuzzily"" compare two source codes and show how close they are, which quite nicely showed of clusters of programs where a bunch of students had copied-and-slightly-modified from one student.<p>(1) i.e., give the instructor a feeling of ""Hm, I've seen that before..."".",1347645556

Sure, that's a little silly since lying on it for a minute or so is unlikely to capture the experience of tossing and turning on it for a night, but it's clear that it's a competitive advantage to let the consumer compare a few models in a physically direct way.<p>Warby Parker can get away with the similar consumer requirement for glasses because glasses are small, light and easy to ship.

You seem to be doing quite fine. However what about the people that created the languages you use? Those who built the processors you work on?<p>A lot of people will never need the things they teach in a standard CS curriculum. I doubt most programmers even know how to spell ""automata"". But then again, most programmers aren't doing anything new or ground breaking. Most programmers are simply rehashing solutions to problems already solved somewhere, or simply making small iterative steps. I have found that my own work seemed very ""small minded"" before I began my formal studies.<p>Even beyond that, I am now equipped to do most anything I choose involving this discipline. I've always wanted to create my own language, and now the only barrier is simply the time and effort I need to put in. I have all the requisite knowledge and background, and my solid foundation will allow me to easily (comparatively) pick up any new concept I might encounter.<p>The average programmer might never desire to create their own language, but for this field to continue to grow we need people to push the limit and innovate beyond our current limitations. To do this you need to have a deep comprehension of what you are working with.<p>However even beyond all of that, I wasn't content with <i>not</i> knowing the intricacies of computation. Maybe I'm just a naturally curious person (and possibly biased), but in my opinion the world of Computer Science is one of the most fascinating fields to have ever studied.<p>One last point... why not?

In keeping with the policies developed by the community in this region, there are two possible ways to transfer IPv4 number resources to another party (via merger & acquisition transfer or via specified transfer), and these are detailed in section 8 of the Number Resource Policy Manual on the ARIN website at <<a href=""https://www.arin.net/policy/nrpm.html&#62"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.arin.net/policy/nrpm.html&#62</a>;<p>It is important to note that transfer of number resources via  either method must be to another party that can demonstrate corresponding need. ARIN's registration services department can assist with this determination in advance or at the time of transfer.  ARIN reiterates the importance of veracity in transfer requests and supporting documentation as fraudulent information can result in resource revocation.<p>NRPM section 8 [2] says<p>Number resources are nontransferable and are not assignable to any other organization unless ARIN has expressly and in writing approved a request for transfer.<p><p>It should be understood that number resources are not 'sold' under ARIN administration.

Apple products ship with sane defaults and I agree with the parent that it's not Apple's fault if someone fiddles a special keyboard on that was off when the box was opened.<p>Regular folks just run with the defaults, which work fine for them. And the few people who work hard to become real experts on the platform do fine because they know at a deep level why problems occur.<p>But in between there is a range of people who know enough about Mac technology to dig in and play around and do some technical troubleshootin, but are unable or unwilling to really really dig in and spend time on hard technical details.

My opinion is more along these lines:<p>> Why would I care TO STORE IN LONG TERM MEMORY the difference between a list and a hash table.<p>There are plenty of things I know I know, things I know I don't know and things I don't know I don't know. The vast majority of my programming knowledge resides in short-term memory; in six months ask me about Linked Lists vs Array Lists and I will have forgotten the primary differences (fast iterate vs fast insert or something like that)... I only vaguely know that today because I was researching something.<p>The biggest challenge I see as a self-taught developer is I see everything on equal footing. That means the basics (map, set, list) and the trivial (apache config settings, tomcat's web.xml) tend to reside in the same heap and if I don't think about one element for awhile it tends to get GC'ed. Since all of my knowledge came from 14 years of on-the-job-training nothing was given particular precedence, everything was important to the task at hand.<p>I believe that's really what frustrates self-taught developers. It isn't that I don't know the answer, or that I'm hostile to learning new things (far from it) it is simply that I never burned these fundamentals into my permament memory. I've tried, but I tend to miss bits and pieces, for example, I needed to refresh myself on autoboxing just a few weeks ago because I just haven't _thought_ about it.",1347644362

The equivalent here is to pay $1B in fines.<p>I'm not saying that fear of terrorism or other boogeymen is as entrenched as racism was in 1896, but if it was that easy to change, we wouldn't have the TSA and all this other nonsense.

Eventually businesses will want to cater to this demographic and the stragglers will flip the IPv6 switch.  With nobody on IPv4, it won't be a premium value-add anymore, and that era will be a distant memory of the past like BBSes are now.<p>Right now the IPv4 situation is not bad enough to make widespread IPv6 support critical to one's economic viability yet.  Being able to see the animated turtle on kame.net isn't quite enough of an incentive, but the incentives will slowly shift.<p>(I see the same transition away from fossil fuels.  Right now, an investment in alternative energies is pure speculation: it may pay off someday, but we don't know when that day is.  When we've run out, though, the payoff will be clear: you will get infinite money the second you figure out some way to give humanity energy.  This will encourage more investment than some nebulous LEED certification will.  Tax credits are nice, but not as nice as cash.)",1347643955

If Apple could, they would never be sold out (but they also would want to never have any stock). They want to make money after all. They certainly do not need to appease investors by lying about the demand they are getting.<p>(Though I maybe should add that the iPhone being initially sold out might be an inevitable failure of the supply chain. Its not like you can switch production on just like that and churn out new phones at full speed. There is some ramp-up. Add to that some pent-up demand, and iPhones being sold out quickly might be inevitable  though that does at least indicate that the new phone likely is no dud, beyond that there isnt much information in that.)",1347643952

From that, I had to research how the Entity Framework data models map to the object models within the software, how these models C/R/U/D and then how the 'snap-in' (the software uses a plugin based system, allowing different plugins to be updated specifically over updating the entire client) works with the host 'shell',<p>Although, I disagree with #1.

I grant that there's some subjectivity there, but it's not an <i>opinion</i>. Either Apple tried to convince us of that, or they didn't.<p>As for the new features, the author didn't say the single-chip radio was the most significant new feature. The author said it would be hard to find any other new features. Now, I <i>think</i> he's trying to say that you'd have a hard time finding iPhone 5 features that don't already exist on other smartphones, in which case I believe that's accurate. But it's very easy to read it as saying you'd have a hard time finding new features on the 5 that weren't in the 4S, which is obviously wrong.<p>The letterboxing is misleading and I think I can make the case that it's outright false. First, it says that all 700,000 apps in the App Store will be letterboxed. This is simply false, as at least some third-party apps will be available in 16:9 on launch day. It goes on to say that Apple has been ""very quiet"" on the question of what happens if you try to use a 16:9 app on a 3:2 device, and whether developers will have to maintain multiple versions. that's simply wrong: the natural way of developing apps will be to use a flexible layout that supports both aspect ratios, developers won't need multiple versions, and it's not difficult to discover this information.",1347643160

So if the flexible layouts didn't suit your need you could make (for example) one for tablets, one for phones. You can do the same for bitmaps so you can have different versions of each for different DPIs.<p>For bitmap aspect ratio issues there are also 9patch bitmaps which specify which portions of the image can be stretched and which can't.

And I don't know how I could do that without knowing sorting algorithms intimately.<p>And I am not writing codecs or kernel code, mostly it has been high performance and some soft real time, but I've also worked in back end web development.<p>Everything in your second paragraph I fully endorse, but your first paragraph is terrifying. I'm terrified I'll run into someone like you some day, clearly smart, clearly experienced and without a clue as to why I'm concerned about the Big-O of his implementation of something.",1347642095

Let's suppose half of them. Assuming a constant growth rate, that would last us for ten more years. But actually internet adoption is still accelerating. A safer assumption would be something like five.<p>But our routers would collapse under the strain of the enormous routing tables long before then. To be able to route efficiently subnets need to be logical regions in the network topology, not arbitrary collections of 2^n machines. CIDR, needed to mitigate against the shortage of IPv4 addresses (or more properly the shortage of subnets) has been slowing the internet down since 1993.<p>>Between the bunch MIT got, the bunch that the military got and the bunch that IBM got, we can implement an entirely new protocol before we run out.<p>Given that we've been working on IPv6 for 15 years and it's not fully deployed yet, no we can't. Even if every single address was unallocated today, we'd use them up before then.",1347642069

You're also limited in how much current you can carry since superconductivity breaks down in sufficiently high magnetic fields. For all that room temperature superconductors are revolutionary because of the jump in power density in things like motors and yes power lines.",1347642065

Haskell is thus <i>not</i> lazy (nor is any other language). Rather, Haskell is a <i>non-strict</i> language, meaning that lambda is just abstraction, not abstraction-plus-strictification as in &quot;strict&quot; languages. Non-strictness does not imply sequential evaluation or indeed any particular evaluation order. (Ditto for strictness.)

HTTP2 is, in definition, only very loosely coupled to IP despite making significant optimisations for TCP.  Thus in implementation we simply get the same old mistakes and undefined behaviours.  Issues with floating apex records, hacks based on IPv4/6 race conditions, unnecessary address wastage and so forth will continue; all derived from the colossal architectural wart of overloading the DNS host (A/AAAA) record as a service endpoint discovery mechanism.<p>Once again, I say unto the peanut gallery: shoulda used SRV.

Why is that? Because building frameworks is the only way that the smartest people can earn money faster than programming the (N+1)th variation on that theme everyone follows -- frameworks are what make people more productive, or allow you to use a workforce that&#x27;s more accessible.<p>As a Wizard With a Pointy Head (aka academic), I&#x27;d say that the need for Wizards With Pointy Heads in production work is often overestimated and/or idealized. There is a large number of PhD graduates, and the market happily gobbles them up (indeed, realizing that you can hire PhDs and have them do productive work is one of the things that made Google successful as a company back in the early 2000s).",1420161726

Ardusat (<a href=""https://www.ardusat.com"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.ardusat.com</a>) is a growing educational technology company providing engaging experiences to science and math students by creating technology, products, and curriculum preparing them to run custom experiments on real satellites in space. With over $6B available in public and private STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math) grants, this is an exciting space to work in.<p>========================================<p>Why Ardusat is an awesome place to work:<p>* Early stage startup with successful seed funding round. We&#x27;ve proven that investors and early adopters are excited about our vision, now we need help making that vision a reality! As part of a small team, you&#x27;ll have the chance to make a real impact on the future direction of the company.<p>* Education is a space where what you are doing matters. Everyone at Ardusat is here because we believe parts of the education system are broken, and need to be fixed. We want our work to impact student&#x27;s lives all over the world by cultivating more interest in math, science, and technology.<p>* We value autonomy, professional development, and life outside work. Do you do your best work when you get out skiing for the morning and work at 1 am? We understand different people work differently, and we want everyone we hire to be inspired by and love what they do. This means that we try to have people work on projects that are interesting to them, provide the resources to continue learning, and give the flexibility to fit in life outside work.<p>* Space is cool. So, you&#x27;re not exactly a rocket scientist? Well, we don&#x27;t actually work with rockets, either, but a satellite engineer is pretty close. We have a close partnership with San Francisco-based Spire and collaborate with their engineering team on a variety of projects. There&#x27;s a good chance that some of the code you write at Ardusat will be running in space in a few months.<p>* Salt Lake City is not the Bay Area. We love visiting the Valley, but we&#x27;re always pretty excited to get home. SLC is more affordable, has way less traffic, and, most importantly, is 30 minutes away from some of the best skiing, mountain biking, rock climbing, and hiking in the country. We are proud to be located somewhere where access to the mountains is close enough that you don&#x27;t have to be a weekend warrior. (We respect powder days)<p>===============<p>Jobs Available:<p>* Front End Developer - We need someone to help develop our various web-based tools. The ideal candidate would be comfortable creating great UX and familiar with modern JS frameworks (we currently use Angular.js) HTML5, CSS3. Experience developing mobile apps is a big plus. We work with a top notch design firm for our creative, but having a decent eye for design is important.<p>* Embedded Software Developer - We need a “full stack” embedded hacker to help us develop some of our product offerings. Experience with typical “maker” technologies (3D printing, proto-board prototyping, Arduino, etc.) is preferred. This is an important, early hire for the team, however, so it involves multiple hats, and we&#x27;re also looking for someone with experience working with backend technologies including sys admin and backend web development (we use Rails and Node.js).<p>============<p>Technologies<p>We try not to be dogmatic about individual technologies. We&#x27;ve all used a lot of different platforms, languages, and idioms over our careers, so we&#x27;re not overly focused on any particular technology/framework. However, we currently use/like the following technologies, and experience with some of them certainly helps!<p>Node.js<p>Ruby on Rails<p>Postgres<p>Angular.js<p>React.js<p>C<p>Arduinos<p>Docker<p>AWS<p>iOS/Android<p>============<p>How to Apply<p>If you think Ardusat sounds like an exciting place to work, we want to hear from you! Please email us at jobs@ardusat.com with a brief description of your background and why you are interested in Ardusat, as well as a portfolio/CV. We would like to see a non-trivial code sample that you feel showcases your coding abilities and experiences – whether that&#x27;s a github profile, side project code sample, OSS contribution or something else.

I think that people sometimes underestimate the degree of customization and effort required to automate a specific process. Or sometimes overestimate, as in, &quot;our process is so special that no commercial tools will work for it.&quot;<p>3. If anybody is going to work on automation, it will be the students themselves, as it&#x27;s a way to learn a valuable skill. They may be doing it with minimal fanfare, and there is a strong movement towards open source tools. Students realize that the generous budgets and site licenses will vanish when they leave the academe, and are interested in preparing themselves for freelance work, startups, etc. This may also favor general purpose tools, rather than those designed specifically for science.<p>My anecdote, from 25+ years ago: I taught myself electronics and programming by automating my student projects, culminating in my thesis experiment.",1420160968

(The programs that eventually became the F-35 both started in the early &#x27;90s.)<p>The F-35 has a lot of problems, but it&#x27;s already made its way through most of that loooong process. Scratching it and going back to the drawing board would reset that clock, which means that even if 1) they started on the new design tomorrow and 2) it turned out much better than the F-35, it wouldn&#x27;t start reaching squadrons until 2035 or even later. Which leaves a big, multi-decade gap where the various services have to keep their aging fighters flying until the New Thing shows up to replace them.",1420160891

This is a unique opportunity to contribute to the core architecture of one of the web’s most innovative and exciting services. You’ll get to work on challenging technical problems alongside a small but driven group of developers, and play a key role in shaping both the product and team culture.<p>IFTTT’s mission is to help people to create connections between the services and devices they use every day. We’ve built a system that enables users to set up simple “if this, then that”-style recipes, which allow activity from one web service to trigger activity in another. The current system supports over 90 unique services and runs hundreds of millions of recipe-handling tasks per day, and we plan to dramatically expand on our flexibility and scalability. Under the hood, this translates to building a platform that can talk to and move data between virtually any API you can think of, all in realtime and at massive scale.<p>We&#x27;re well funded, and we work hard to do right by our employees. New hires at IFTTT enjoy competitive salary and equity, full benefits, and a flexible vacation policy. Much more than that, we offer interesting, deep projects and an amazing team experience. We operate on the philosophy that the best job perk is fantastic teammates, and to this end we’ve assembled a staff of intensely curious, well-rounded, talented people who happen to be great engineers. We’re hoping you can be the next one.<p>Visit <a href=""https://ifttt.com/jobs"" rel=""nofollow"">https://ifttt.com/jobs</a> for more information.",1420160856

Even if Maven is not &quot;good enough&quot;, .NET is thousand miles behind Java when it comes to dependency management and build system.<p>Google-Guava, as ugly as the syntax is, is good enough for most of us.

6903144,comment,6901442,6901442,36,0,bhauer,,,"I&#x27;ve had the misfortune of using the PayPal Java SDK to integrate PayPal credit card and Express payment into a web application.  Based on that experience, I find it especially difficult to digest any opinion that PayPal has on Java.  They may be experts on handling money, processing credit card payments, fraud prevention, and the like.  (Or maybe not, given their reputation.)  But their opinion on Java is about as meaningful to me as Microsoft&#x27;s opinion on Java.  Or more on point, a Rails developer&#x27;s opinion on Java.  Both are characteristically stale.  And not &quot;whew, that bread is really ripe, throw it out&quot; stale.  Rather, &quot;what we have here is a new form of fungal life&quot; stale.<p>I&#x27;ve worked with a fair number of Java APIs.  I would put the quality of their Java SDK in the bottom 10%.  It has the stench of <i>really old</i> Java.  Remember how the first Java APIs reeked of C?  The fact that the PayPal Java SDK still looked like hastily ported C code in 2011 when I last worked with it makes me worry that their entire manner of using Java is stuck in the early 2000s.  That&#x27;s being generous.  It&#x27;s the kind of Java you&#x27;d expect to see written by a company that still thinks about &quot;applets&quot; and &quot;beans&quot; and tries to come up with clever coffee double-entendres for their package names.<p>My theory: PayPal is big but they know they are vulnerable.  They&#x27;ve acquired BrainTree and that helps.  I suspect they want to improve their technical chops and felt a <i>need</i> to migrate away from Java in order to break free of their organizational quagmire.  PayPal is from 1998 and if their Java SDK is any indicator, they probably have a Subversion commit log for their core systems going all the way back.<p>This sort of move is the kind of thing I could see myself doing if I were in a decision-making position at PayPal.  Attempting to invigorate sensible modern Java practices within that organization would seem hopeless.  I would have to start anew with an approach that is free of poisonous legacy.<p>As others have pointed out, the fact that a rewrite yielded <i>so little</i> performance gain is decidedly troubling.  At least they got a fun and well-linked blog entry out of it.  If I had just gone through that effort and reaped such a modest improvement, I&#x27;d be crestfallen.",1386971911

I know they also have a new policy that if you can&#x27;t get something to work and they can&#x27;t either, they also refund you the money.

A good framework gives a great story. Unit tests, integration tests, consistent layers, convenient and powerful ways to access the database without writing a giant SQL generator (if x return &quot;and b.id = c.id&quot; else return &quot;b.name = &quot;%&quot; + name + &quot;%&quot;)...<p>But then, you hit the use case that the framework didn&#x27;t consider. And suddenly, you either need to extend the framework (never pleasant) or go outside the framework for one portion, which means building all of the tools from the ground up.<p>Or, more often, ignore testing, hack in the best way you know how, and hope nothing breaks.<p>The library approach means that you have to build the integration pieces yourself. This is painful, but it means that when you reach a new use case, it isn&#x27;t as large a jump to keep going.<p>Each has tradeoffs. There are times when each is superior. Someone like Bob Martin would suggest that you build your system independent of frameworks and treat the web as a client/compatibility layer, and that you build your system of small composable parts so that the framework/library question is a minor one. (This has its own tradeoff with an abhorrent amount of plumbing code that comes along.)<p>It all comes back to the problem at hand and how we judge the tradeoffs, like most engineering problems.",1386970848

For example, it is still taken for granted by almost every authority that knowledge consists of justified, true beliefs</i><p>-------------------<p>The Gettier problem has been well known in Philosophy since the 60s. Probably the most famous example would be barn-façades, first showing up in the mid 70s. It&#x27;s taught in undergraduate courses. It&#x27;s the second bullet point on the Standford Encyclopedia of Philosophy&#x27;s Epistemology article.<p>-------------------<p>> <i>How could I have ‘extrapolated’ that there would be such a sharp departure from an unbroken pattern of experiences, and that a never-yet-observed process (the 17,000-year interval) would follow?</i><p>-------------------<p>One rather assumes your experience with numbers has included 20 following 19 before and you extrapolated the rules from that and similar experiences with assigning numbers to things. You were, after all, previously told that it&#x27;s how years worked - and doubtless you&#x27;ve lived through at least one year changing.<p>-------------------<p>> <i>Even in the hard sciences, these guesses have no foundations and don’t need justification. Why? Because genuine knowledge, though by definition it does contain truth, almost always contains error as well. So it is not ‘true’ in the sense studied in mathematics and logic. Thinking consists of criticising and correcting partially true guesses with the intention of locating and eliminating the errors and misconceptions in them, not generating or justifying extrapolations from sense data.</i><p>-------------------<p>Be that as it may, some guesses are better than others. Generally the guesses that are based on more data. You lock someone in a room for 19 years, don&#x27;t talk to them beyond the basic social interaction required for them to develop language, and then ask them to guess what an atom bomb is, they&#x27;re not going to get very far. Even guessing what an atom is, or a bomb they&#x27;d be hopelessly out of the context of their experience.<p>Guesses, in so far as they&#x27;re meaningful, have foundations. Those foundations limit what you can guess about and have any practical chance of refining towards truth with more evidence. You can&#x27;t start off knowing nothing and then go to nuclear weapons in one step. You have to make smaller guesses, based on what you know.<p>And much though the author you might criticise Bayesian probability, this is bound up in the idea that probability is based on dividing the search space between the explanations we can come up with for a thing and then weighting it with evidence.",1386970837

The JVM can be blindingly fast at running your code, but when it hits a point where you make a database call or web services call that&#x27;s implemented synchronously, it sits there, waiting, doing nothing. No amount of VM optimizations can increase of the speed of idling code.<p>This is why Node apps often out-perform Java apps despite running on a VM that&#x27;s significantly slower. Node is pervasively asynchronous...it&#x27;s baked into the DNA of the platform and almost all libraries follow that philosophy. And as organizations move to a micro-services architecture where one external call can result in multiple internal calls between systems, the need for reactive, asynchronous programming becomes all the more glaring.<p>That&#x27;s where this critique, for me, fell down. It&#x27;s spent too much time comparing the JVM to V8 and not enough time talking about how the applications being run were designed. Because CPUs are fast enough these days that any of the VMs will give you decent performance for workloads that aren&#x27;t CPU-bound as long as you, the application designer, do the right thing. It&#x27;s just that some environments, Node in particular, make it easier to do the right thing. This will get easier in Java with the introduction of lambdas in Java 8 and the inevitable asynchronous community frameworks and libraries, but right now it&#x27;s still harder to write reactive applications in Java than it is in Node.",1386970475

Compression can lead to degraded pressure point relief which can lead to spinal issues and discomfort.<p>Regarding the 5-7 years, if you look at a mattress that has a 10-25 year warranty closely you will notice that it is pro-rated. Meaning each year you own it, they will credit you less and less. This essentially breaks even somewhere around 5 years. Not to mention they make you jump through some serious hoops to prove it is damaged. We view this as a gimmick. So what we do is just provide a clean warranty at 5 years and exchange it if there are any problems.

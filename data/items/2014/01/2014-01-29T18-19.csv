I have been going through the interview process.<p>Yesterday, I had an interview with one of the big software companies. (Not going to name) The interviewer asked me one of the regular programming questions which I completely blanked out on. At the end of the interview, I felt that he was very insulting to me (I am unsure if this is normal). He told me that he could not figure out where to place me and that I should go get a Masters. He also said that my skill set was too broad and not focused enough. Granted my GPA has suffered last year to lower than the average. I have been very involved in projects ever since I can remember. I even founded a research project which I wrote a proposal for and got academic funding towards.<p>I did mess up his question. But what else did I do that was wrong?<p>I will take one of his advice. To find something to focus towards. I want to start contributing to open source projects in the hopes of finding something I can be passionate about. Could I get suggestions on how to begin?

Then you hammer it out and they&#x27;re looking for what we call a &#x27;vulnerability assessment&#x27;.  The pen-test without the pen- phase.<p>There&#x27;s a large number of people running those tools and doing exactly as you describe.  I call them, &#x27;the competition&#x27;.  They bid low and ship a canned report with little to no analysis or follow-up.  I highly recommend everyone scan themselves regularly.  None of the tools you mentioned are too scary.  I do tend to find the severity ratings to be out of whack with the real world impacts a lot of times, so if you see a bunch of red in the report don&#x27;t panic.  Read the text and figure out what it means to your network.  The Metasploit Framework has a bit of a learning curve, but nothing too daunting and really it&#x27;s not necessary for a maintenance scan.  You can always invest in a licensed version if the Framework scares you.<p>Those tools don&#x27;t provide meaningful coverage of web applications but they would give you a decent idea of the security posture of your network perimeter.<p>Many situations require the disinterested third party to perform the assessment or audit though.  Sometimes customers/partners want to see your last report if you&#x27;re dealing B2B and then there are the compliance requirements (PCI, health or personal information).<p>The one thing about that report that really bothered me was the remediation price tags.  I know a lot of companies do similar things but we never offer remediation services since it would put us in a conflict of interest.  I turn down security product installs regularly on our assessment and penetration testing customers because I don&#x27;t want us in a position where we&#x27;re auditing our own work.

Although W|A has by no means perfected this, this is hardly an alternative - queries like &quot;factor the number 100&quot; fail because there is only the beginnings of a free-form transformer. Obviously, the usefulness of being able to answer &quot;factor one hundred&quot; is questionable, but W|A solved it out of Stephen Wolfram&#x27;s aspiration to be able to &quot;compute everything&quot;. Right now, this is just a programming language you can run on the web.<p>The other thing is that W|A has trillions of data points and what I am only allowed to describe as the beginnings of a semantic network for inferring relations between them. It was a vastly overcomplicated system that was difficult to work with, so I am quite confident that some day there will be an open-source alternative that anyone can contribute to.<p>The other thing to take into account is how this affects the future. Wolfram Research thought they were going to &quot;disrupt the calculator&quot; (I heard this ridiculous statement once at a meeting). In reality, Wolfram Alpha queries are more often for the sake of fun than for the sake of discovery (I know this because there was a big TV in the break room that would keep displaying things that people searched on Wolfram Alpha). Is it really that useful to be able to have a computer give you an answer to &quot;I have two apples, Jill has three apples.

I stupidly forgot to check the status of my backups; because of an earlier error, they were not being correctly saved.<p>So, I had a bunch of tables with similar names:<p><pre><code>    users_1024\n    users_1025\n    users_1026\n</code></pre>\nI decided to delete them all in one big swoop.<p>Guess what got deleted along with them?  The <i>actual</i> users table (which I&#x27;ve since renamed to something that does not even contain &quot;users&quot; in it).<p>So, how do you recover a users table when you&#x27;ve just deleted it and your backup has failed?<p>Well, I happened to have all of my users&#x27; email addresses stored in a separate mailing list table, but that table did not store their associated user IDs.<p>So I sent them all an email, prompting them to visit a password reset page.<p>When they visited the page, if their user ID was stored in a cookie -- and for most of them, it was -- I was able to re-associate their user ID with their email address, prompt them to select a new password, and essentially restore their account activity.<p>There was a small subset of users who did not have their user IDs stored in a cookie, though.<p>Here&#x27;s how I tackled that problem:<p>Because the bulk of a user&#x27;s activity on the site involves answering poll questions, I prompted them to select some poll questions that they had answered previously, and that they were certain they could answer again in the same way.  I was then able to compare their answers to the list of previous responses and narrow down the possibilities.  Once I had narrowed it down to a single user, I prompted them to answer a few more &quot;challenge&quot; questions from that user&#x27;s history, to make sure that the match was correct.  (Of course, that type of strategy would not work for a website where you have to be 100% sure, rather than, say, 98% sure, that you&#x27;ve matched the correct person to the account.)",1391019411

After a brief interview I got the job for a pretty decent salary and was told when I could start. What they hadn&#x27;t told me was that my schedule would be tuesday to saturday. I had informed the hiring manager of my preferred schedule (monday-friday), but I guess nobody mentioned it to the manager of the group.<p>When I got there they told me my schedule and I immediately told them that&#x27;s not what I signed up for. So they asked me to sit for a while so they could figure out what to do next. I took a tour of the NOC, and saw one of their tier 1 technicians was chatting and watching a movie. I walked up and asked him &quot;Heyya! Workin&#x27; hard, or hardly workin&#x27;?&quot; and smiled. He did not smile back. So I went back to the desk I was assigned to, which was already logged in - with the credentials of the previous admin.<p>While I waited I decided to see what other trouble I could get into. Sure enough, all the old passwords were saved in the old admin&#x27;s browser with no master password. I couldn&#x27;t copy-paste the list, so I took a screenshot and began to find a way to print the list out to post on my cube wall. Before I could finish I was asked to leave for the day while they figured out my schedule changes. I should have gotten the hint when they asked me to leave the badge there.<p>Later I got a voicemail telling me they&#x27;d pay me for the time I spent there (about three hours) and they&#x27;d no longer require my services. Luckily I got hired soon after to a different company, which was also hiring away all the talented people from the place that had let me go, and the web hosting company eventually went under.

But then some lawler figures out how to make a tenuous connection with a completely lineage-unrelated patent and they go <i>trolling</i> for settlements, regardless of whether they&#x27;re a small company that does only this or staff counsel for a large company that also happens to manufacture things.<p>But no shit large companies like IBM, Apple, Oracle, etc want to limit patent reform to &quot;non-practicing entities&quot; and continue their general low-stakes protection racket while screwing over the little guys (genuine patent holders and patent victims alike).",1391018967

The issue is that the GPL requires all the recipients of GPL software you distribute to also have the rights to distribute the software. Patent licences conflict with that.<p>Secondly, you are not allowed to re-licence code that you do not own the copyright to (I guess a licence like WTFPL would permit it as well). Your example of taking BSD source and removing the BSD licence to replace it with a Shared Source licence is not something that is permitted. The text of the BSD licence is very clear on that point. I don&#x27;t know why GNU fans continue to be confused about this. The BSD parts of a combined work will remain BSD licensed and the recipient of that source is fully able to utilise those BSD sections of the source code in ways the BSD licence allows. Putting a more restrictive licence on the combined work does not change that.<p>>What you can not do is put BSD on the whole work, as that would conflict with the patent license. The BSD is a license that grant recipients full permission to distribute<p>Again, it sounds like you are pretty confused about the issues here. The BSD licence merely covers copyright concerns. You <i>do not need to provide a patent licence if you release code under a BSD style licence</i>. The licence says that the copyright holder grants the recipient permission to copy, modify and redistribute the code. Any other obligations the recipient might have, such as patents, don&#x27;t affect the copyright holders ability to grant that permission. I&#x27;ve said this several times now and I&#x27;m not sure how much clearer I can make it. Yes there is a conflict for the recipient in the sense that they may only have the copyright licence to redistribute a binary, not the patent licence. But that is an issue for the recipient and does not affect the author&#x27;s right to licence their work under a BSD style licence.<p>For somebody going around accusing other of spreading FUD it certainly seems like you have a very weak grasp of the issues here.",1391018901

So if you copy the code purely to learn about it, that is arguably not an infringement.  Using the code is in violation without a license.  This applies whether source, interpreted, compiled, bytecode, or decompiled.  It will be harder to convince a judge that you were just studying it if you have only a form that is conducive to running and not conducive to study, though, <i>if</i> you are found out and sued.<p>Of course, you&#x27;d better not plan on <i>using</i> anything you learned from it until you negotiate licenses for <i>your</i> users (or the patent expires).",1391018522
7145563,comment,7141908,7143451,1,0,zaroth,,,"Agree with everything you&#x27;ve said, and I still think Google has to pay for infringing.<p>Patents are NOT just to prevent copying. Patents are not supposed to be worthless against larger companies who can just replicate your work without your help.<p>If you could just re-engineer any patented invention, patents would be worthless. Companies would be incentivized to bury their heads in the sand so they could be sure they were not &#x27;inspired&#x27; by anything out there that might have been patented. The only way to prevent this is to say, we don&#x27;t care if you &quot;knew&quot; about the patent you still can be found infringing.<p>The thing I hope will be reversed on appeal is willfulness. It seems to me this was not willful. Or perhaps the definition of &#x27;willful&#x27; should be tightened to mean reverse-engineered or copied from a practicing entity. That&#x27;s one way to get the damage award to be more reasonable.",1391018519

Last time I had to do furniture shopping, I had to keep going to a bunch of different sites to see who had what I wanted and what their price ranges were.<p>I also like the grouping of items based on cost range, as that was how I was primarily searching for stuff.<p>The only place it falls apart for me is in the ability to create a shopping cart. I may be in the minority, but when I was furniture shopping I was looking for a whole room or set of things. With this site, it&#x27;s very easy to buy one thing, but when you want to buy 3 or 4 pieces it can become a bit of a hassle.",1391018513

7145553,comment,7144934,7144934,12,0,itwasme,,,"I once worked for a company that schedules advertising before films. This wasn&#x27;t in the US and the company had a monopoly over all of the ads shown across the country. It was my first programming job and done during university holidays, so I was there for a couple of months and then back to university. Toward the end of the following year I get a phone call: something was wrong with the system, it was allowing agents to overbook advertising slots. I diagnosed the problem over the phone and they put a fix in but management decided it was too late for the company to go back and cancel all of the ads that were already booked. This was not surprising as it was the most money they&#x27;d ever made. Conveniently, the parent company owned the cinemas so they did a deal where they just showed all of the ads that were booked.<p>Because of me, one December, everyone in the country who went to the cinema got to watch anywhere between 30 and 45 minutes of ads before the main presentation started.<p>Lesson learned: write more tests, monitor everything.",1391018441

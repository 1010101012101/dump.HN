Go to a developers' or tech conference, and what is the prevailing OS?  9/10 times these days, it's MacOS.<p>As much as Apple may be control freaks, they did desktop UNIX right and developers have flocked to them.<p>Meanwhile, the Linux desktop community is still having the same debates, the same difficulties it had back in the mid-90's.  Dependency issues.  Lack of compelling use case software; and that which does exist is versions behind current.  Fragmentation.<p>The only areas in which the Linux desktop has moved forward is UI and user-oriented management, and Ubuntu deserves much of the credit for the latter.<p>Add to this the gradual movement away from the desktop paradigm to mobile.  The desktop paradigm will still be around for several years (especially for creators--developers, media folks, etc), but the end-user is moving more and more towards smartphones and tablets for consumption.  Extend those with external keyboards and monitors (think docks) for light
creation work (documents, spreadsheets, etc), and you've the future.<p>Nope.  The Linux desktop is dead.",1331996353

You probably still want a category focus. In the 90s, at one point the other dozen auction sites shared/exchanged their listings into one combined, shared set of listings, and eBay still killed them. But if you can choose a category, you can beat eBay.<p>- bit coin or other payment community, cool direction<p>- mixing in results from eBay is a great idea.

3717200,comment,3716781,3717132,1,0,morsch,,,"You are broadly describing PPAs. Adding a package from a PPA is a three-line (easily scriptable) process: <i>add-apt-repository <url|ppa-name></i>, <i>apt-get update</i>, <i>apt-get install <package></i>. Obviously, that doesn't just work for PPAs, but for all apt repositories.<p>Launchpad does some central indexing (""other versions of this package"") for PPAs, but I don't think it's accessible via command line. There is no indication how popular a PPA is, but PPAs are linked to admin user accounts which might help. Packages are signed and the key is auto-imported. Packages co-exist alongside packages from the repos, you can easily switch between different provided versions.<p>Installing a plain deb is much easier still, but you don't get upgrades (unless the repository is auto-added during install) or signing.",1331996349

In cases where there was more than one architecture, there would frequently be multiple file servers, one per arch.  Another remnant of this on modern systems: ""/usr/share"" usually contains data like machine-independent help files that could be mounted across architectures.<p>The result of this was that users could hotseat from machine to machine, and site-specific software would only need be installed once, which was a space/complexity win.",1331996248

This will let Github enhance their own automated software development suite. Github analyzes open-source and closed-source code (under licensing agreements) to produce new software automatically on demand. Currently Github primarily determines a piece of code&#x27;s functionality from its unit tests, but this acquisition will let them expand their source of knowledge.<p>This may increase the concern among some developers and algorithm managers that Github is becoming too powerful. There has been controversy in the past over Github&#x27;s restricted API access to open source code on its site.

9973079,comment,9969997,9972196,0,0,DrJosiah,,,"The existing implementation is a proof of concept. It works as advertised, but any key that is written to as part of script execution gets dumped using the same internals that the DUMP command uses.<p>For a handful of small keys, where EVALTXN/EVALSHATXN calls are coming one at a time from your clients, the performance difference is relatively minor - on the order of a few percent.<p>But for large keys, or large numbers of modified keys, because every key is being dumped before being written to the first time (and because the current implementation uses a singly-linked list to manage the rollback buffer, leading to a linear search for whether a key has been changed), the slowdown is substantial, and there is no upper bound on the slowdown.<p>But how can there be no upper bound on the slowdown? How big are your keys, and how many are you changing? If you&#x27;re dumping 5x string keys all of under a few hundred bytes as part of each script execution, Redis is not going to have a problem. But if you are dumping 1000x 1M element ZSETs, of course it&#x27;s going to be slow!<p>The point of the patch is to get people (like you) asking questions and hopefully wanting to help. There isn&#x27;t any good reason for Redis to not have transactions, aside from someone not taking the time to do it. The current implementation is crap. But the crap implementation is substantially better than not having it.<p>The next step? Teaching data structures how to offer the ability to reverse operations on themselves. Or fetching versions from caught-up slaves. Or (now that fork() performance is good due to no transparent hugepages) pull the data from a fork()ed child. Or write changed structures to disk in a secondary thread in the background, force structure syncs on write (if there are changes), and pull them from disk on rollback (as necessary).<p>There are several different ways that this can be improved substantially, and the only thing stopping it right now is time and effort. I will be doing my best to work on it further (I had been sitting on the original version of the patch for 2 months because I didn&#x27;t have time to work on it), but that doesn&#x27;t mean that Redis has to wait for me. I know there are people out there, Salvatore included, who can help take the idea and turn it into something that everyone uses and expects to be available, because the current state of affairs is terribly unfortunate and a recipe for data loss/corruption (which has happened to me).",1438228038

9973075,comment,9967329,9972830,0,0,brudgers,,,"Your experience is your experience. I don&#x27;t doubt that what you have found works, works for you. Markets vary geographically, by industry, and by capital structure. Clients vary in expectations. Contractors vary in temperament. Projects vary in firmness and in scope. The only universal is that everyone should double their rates.<p>I did my first freelance gig in 1990. It involved Leroying. I&#x27;ve used fixed price. I&#x27;ve been billed out hourly to buy a job by a big firm that <i>always</i> did fixed price. I&#x27;ve chunked my time in half days. I&#x27;ve chunked it by the hour. I&#x27;ve eaten phone calls and charged for them. I&#x27;ve had clients who have more money than you or I will ever see and waitresses...and waitresses are great clients because they pay in cash and always have some in their pocket at every meeting. I&#x27;ve handed off a roll of drawings for $18,000 in cash from a safe placed in my other hand in the back of bar, drug deal style.<p>Some clients want high maintenance. Some are respectful of the fact that my time is money. Some are even charities and get some services for free. Businesses aren&#x27;t charities.<p>All of which is to say is that reasons I wouldn&#x27;t bill for phone calls or whatever were:<p><pre><code>  1. I was afraid of pissing clients off.
  2. I didn&#x27;t want to be that disciplined.
</code></pre>
One day I realized that clients who get pissed off paying for my time aren&#x27;t going to care what or how I bill. They simply don&#x27;t want to pay and clients that don&#x27;t want to pay aren&#x27;t worth having because...well, they tend not to pay. So billing hourly and nickling and diming and requiring a healthy retainer against final invoice [along with the aforementioned higher rate] turns out to be a useful tool for screening clients. And providing a rate at the initial conversation is a useful screen for random leads.<p>So yeah, I&#x27;ll bill 15 minutes for an email. It takes me at least that long to do it right. Charging aligns my interests (getting paid) with those of my clients (my doing the things they hired me to do right and not cutting corners). If it&#x27;s not worth billing for then doing it isn&#x27;t probably very important.<p>It is worth noting that I typically have a single point of contact. It&#x27;s part of the industry landscape. Yesterday I was talking with a friend of mine from Jr. High. He&#x27;s a chemist and the primary stay at home parent and does consulting on the side. In his industry royalties are money on the table: I learn something new every day.",1438228005

Is obfs4 sending an SNI header for the fake SSL session?  If so, an observer can connect to the named server himself and see things like a) the SNI header is faked, e.g. if there is no DNS entry for that name, b) it&#x27;s not really an HTTPS server, c) it doesn&#x27;t have enough discoverable content to really justify you spending hours using it every day, d) nothing else on the web links to this server.  If it&#x27;s not sending SNI, that&#x27;s probably unusual these days too, so they know your client is non-standard.<p>I don&#x27;t know, maybe I&#x27;m overthinking and/or considering things you don&#x27;t care about as part of your threat model.  I suppose some of this could be overcome by using a client certificate whitelist as a plausible reason to not serve anything to snoopers, but then you and/or the bridge are somewhat identifiable as users of an obscure SSL feature.  And since the client certificate is in plain text[2], you&#x27;re either trackable by a static certificate, or identifiable as something unusual if using many rotating certificates all coming from the same IP.<p>[1] Maybe this is weird logic, but in other words, if you are paranoid enough to be trying to obfuscate your tor usage, I don&#x27;t see why you should believe this can be secure enough (unless obfs4 has addressed these issues somehow.)  But maybe the point is more about web filters just smart enough to block standard tor, than about constantly evolving spies bent on unraveling <i>your</i> communications.<p>[2] <a href=""https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/24577/client-certificate-in-ssl-handshake-insecure"" rel=""nofollow"">https://security.stackexchange.com/questions/24577/client-ce...</a>",1438227841

This, and I&#x27;m a novice programmer.<p>So I look at Blockspring, and my first thought is that I don&#x27;t quite get it, although if they ran on proprietary, internal data sources, it would make sense. (Do people really download Amazon listings into Excel? I suppose). Or, if they could get a company like Factset or Bloomberg to let them do direct data pulls from their databases, then you&#x27;d get masses of high quality data to analyze.<p>In terms of the core &quot;into excel&quot; functionality - maybe I am understating my novice capabilities, but ever since I discovered ExcelDNA it seems like you can do almost anything with Excel and C#.",1438225366

So these agent instances were being continually created and destroyed, and the GC lag absolutely killed performance and made the game totally unplayable. It was unplayable even on a Galaxy S2 - a reasonably high-performance phone at the time. Once I implemented object pooling to handle the creation and destruction of these agents, the game ran very smoothly on an S2, and I could even run the smaller simulations on an old HTC Magic I had lying around. It made an enormous difference.",1438225359

It&#x27;s not that I can&#x27;t finish the test in the allotted time, but knowing that I am being timed will make my brain race and do stupid things. Personally, I don&#x27;t mind take home tests that take more than 2 hours, as long as they reflect the actual work I would be doing in that position.",1438225240

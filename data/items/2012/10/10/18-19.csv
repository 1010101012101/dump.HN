4637670,comment,4637196,4637196,9,0,soup10,,,"One take away point from this for non-c coders is that higher level languages will always be significantly slower than C because it's far easier to make these kinds of fiddly pipeline optimizations when you don't have another abstraction layer in between mucking things up. There's few java programmers for instance that both intuitevly understand how both the machine architecture, and the JVM compiler will affect the code they write. There's too many quirks.  While in theory it's possible to write comparably fast java code(assuming your willing to do sketchy things for memory manipulation related tasks).  In practice it's significantly more difficult to get all the juice out with higher level languages.",1349895523

IMO Janus is also a good project.<p>Where it differs is spf13-vim is focused on cross platform dependency, keeping with vanilla vim feel and having no external dependencies (with the exception of git).<p>My understanding on Janus is that it focuses on Ruby (spf13-vim supports Ruby well, but Python, JavaScript, PHP, Shell, Scala and a bunch more as well). Janus includes many plugins that depend on Vim Ruby support and is definitely focused on the MacVim platform.<p>My goal was a Vim configuration you could run anywhere whether Linux, Mac or Windows to efficiently develop in any language.<p>Hopefully you will find the quality control is good, general feedback is very positive.

Aereo is being sued by rightsholders, who argue that as the parties that fund the creation of content, it should be up to them how to commercialize it. Copyright isn't regulation.

4637635,comment,4637480,4637480,22,0,rayiner,,,"The usual term for this is ""regulatory arbitrage.""<p>I do want to take exception to one point though:<p>> Of course regulations that truly protect the public interest are necessary. But many regulations are created by incumbents to protect their market position. To try new things, entrepreneurs need to find a back door. And when they succeed, it will all look obvious in retrospect. Todays regulatory hack is tomorrows mainstream industry.<p>It's really a lot more complex than this. A lot of the regulations that seem obviously protectionist now really weren't at the time they were implemented.<p>The FCC is rife with examples of seemingly protectionist regulations because one of the core parts of its mission is to ensure universal coverage. It exists to ensure that every little town in the US gets access to the new communications technologies within a reasonable time.<p>Things like local monopolies/duopolies are the tool that the FCC uses to get companies to serve areas that the free market would leave unserved. The FCC says: ""okay, you get a duopoly in Chicago, but you have to build out service to Belleville, IL.""<p>The taxi regulations operate much in the same way. If taxi companies were left to their own devices, they just wouldn't operate in the sketchier parts of town. They'd refuse to drive you to the Bronx. Protectionist regulations are the concession that municipalities give to taxi companies in return for forcing them to provide certain services and maintain certain rates.<p>You'll also see a lot of this in the utility industry. Local monopolies with guaranteed rates of return are an incentive municipalities use to get companies to provide power/water/gas to everyone, instead of just the places where it's profitable.<p>Municipal regulation is a very complex topic, both legally and in terms of economic theory. You can't consider the regulations standing alone, when you're talking about industries that in some way form the infrastructure of the city or relate to urban planning. You have to consider them in the context of being alternatives to the cities building out certain infrastructure themselves as part of their mandate to provide service to each one of their citizens.",1349895049

4637624,comment,4637339,4637339,29,0,sitharus,,,"What's happening here is freetype2 (and to a greater extent Windows) are grid-fitting the fonts. They anchor the font to the nearest pixel via a rather complex algorithm, and then anti-alias that. You can see exactly what's happening on Windows by turning off ClearType.<p>This results in a font that is sharper on screen, but is more jagged and doesn't resemble the print counterpart quite as well.<p>MacOS on the other hand renders the font as it would for print - ignoring pixel boundaries - then antialiases that. On low DPI screens this results in a heavier feeling font, and some times artefacts where parts of the font get blurred out, but there's less difference between screen and print.<p>This was more useful when Macs were used heavily in pre-press, you'd want your display to match the print so you can avoid making proofs.<p>A few fonts include pixel alignment hints which Windows (but not freetype unless you compile yourself - Apple has patents on this) and MacOS can use to make a nicer alignment on screen, but since the libraries got better at auto-fitting these have dropped away. Take a newish font and put in on Windows XP with ClearType off to see how bad XP's was. Vista was better and 7 is pretty similar to MacOS when there are no hints.<p>It's not so relevant these days, but I don't imagine Apple changing. I'd expect Apple to move to high DPI screens over the next few years where this isn't an issue.",1349894809

Examples: It used to be on a 486 even correctly-predicted taken branches had a two-cycle penalty. It used to be important whether you arranged your code so the most commonly taken code was on the fall through path or not. Today, correctly predicted branches are free--the processor stitches together the current path and the new path so there are no bubbles in the pipeline. Virtual function calls also used to be more expensive back in the day, because CPU's didn't try to predict the target address of the branch. Today, CPU's have a buffer that maps from a program counter to a target address, so if your virtual function call predictably hits the same target each time, the only overhead will be the extra memory accesses to indirect through the v-table.<p>At the same time, things that are expensive today may not be so in the near future. Haswell is supposed to make uncontended synchronization operations almost free. It'll make a lot of algorithms, particularly lock-free algorithms, much more practical than they are today. For example, C++ smart pointers are slow in multi-threaded situations because the reference count manipulation needs to be done under a lock. But the lock is almost never needed (except when it is). Cheap synchronization should make it much more practical to use reference counting more pervasively in C++ programs.",1349893563

Generally if you follow Android best practises you will be fine.  On the other hand if you pretend it is a dumb iOS device you'll have trouble.  For example if you do screen layout using pixels you'll be digging a big hole.<p>As for testing, things can be easier.  Unlike iOS provisioning profiles you can give the application package (apk) to anyone and they can sideload it onto their device (even from following a web browser link).  They just have to change one setting to allow this.  This means you can distribute your app for testing to friends, family and others easily.  When you put the app on the Play Store you can also restrict it.  If you think there could be major compatibility issues then make it available only a small subset of countries/carriers/devices and increase as you get more comfortable.<p>See this talk <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Erd2k6EKxCQ"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Erd2k6EKxCQ</a> (22 minutes in if you want to skip the big picture) for how you can preview your UI across a multitude of languages and form factors.<p>There are places that let you test with devices remotely.

But I still find their home page confusing, with lots of horizontal and vertical vectors at cross-purposes.<p>What they're missing is a 'reject' button that would allow people to easily dismiss things they don't want to see. I don't always know what I want on a home page, and I appreciate the suggestions that can be algorithmically generated from my previous and ongoing activity. But I usually know instinctively what I <i>don't</i> want. Sadly, eBay provides me with no way to communicate that, even though it would free up space for more well-targeted (and therefore valuable) suggestions. They're not the only company with this problem.<p>The problem with product suggestions is that they're limited by computers' inability to model the purpose of things. For example, we bought our first house last year, and as a result I ended up owning a lot more tools, having a subscription to a DIY magazine, and so on. Now every time I go on eBay or Amazon I get lots of suggestions for things for like power tools, based on this major change in my shopping activity over the last year. Fair enough, except that once I have bought a good drill, I probably don't need another one. Sure, I bought several power tools for different things, but having acquired the basic necessities it's not like I want to keep collecting them. Instead of showing me more tools, the smart thing now would be to start showing me accessories like drill bits and saw blades, which need regular replacement and have higher profit margins. But most shopping algorithms seem unable to effectively model product associations, distinguish between total and marginal profits, or usage patterns. Most attempts at the latter seem to involve expert systems, whereas I suspect the right approach is a multiscalar one (but now I am running up against my ignorance of the proper terminology).",1349892298

This is the concept of spatial locality[1].<p>[1]<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Locality_of_reference#Locality_of_reference"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Locality_of_reference#Locality_...</a>",1349892011

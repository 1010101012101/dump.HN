6645575,comment,6644955,6644955,10,0,deckiedan,,,"My life would be a lot easier if there were some more restrictions on file-names, it&#x27;s true. Just cutting out newlines would save me a lot of grief.<p>At my work I&#x27;m doing a lot of sysop/devops/admin stuff for a media production team.  The team-wide project file structure contains a whole bunch of folders starting with &#x27;-&#x27;.  It&#x27;s not a problem, you just have to write all scripts being aware of it.<p>As we&#x27;re making videos about different places around the world, it&#x27;s not uncommon for editors to copy and paste things (including unicode weird other languages, etc) into filenames from OSX Finder.<p>I got caught out recently when someone had pasted in some text with newlines. Boy can that ever run havok.<p>The thing which got me was that BSD md5 on OSX and GNU md5sum on CentOS handle things differently (using \ before a filename with control characters in it on one of them).  So creating a md5 list on one computer and comparing it against a list made on another computer was failing, even though the files where exactly the same.<p>Also annoying is trying to write scripts which handle &quot; and &#x27; in names.<p>The typical BASH tutorial response is, &#x27;use &quot;$VAR&quot;! That always works!&#x27;<p>Unless you are sending a command to run on a remote server, or putting together a rsync command that runs over SSH.  Then, it breaks.  So:<p><pre><code>    PATH=&quot;Fred&#x27;s New: \&quot;Test\&quot; Project!&quot;
    rsync -ave &quot;ssh -i ~/.ssh/key&quot; --delete &quot;$PATH/&quot; &quot;user@remote:$PATH&quot;
</code></pre>
will have problems. (If I remember correctly).  I think this one was fixed with something odd like using &#x27; quotes, and then replacing all &#x27; in the filenames with &#x27;\&#x27;&#x27; (which ends the current string, puts a single quote on its own as a string, and then starts the string again, but treats them all as one long string).<p>99% of my problems went away when I switched most scripts over to python.<p>(And, yes, started adding more and more weirdo filenames into my /shell/ /script/ unit tests...)",1383202485

But if other factors besides the average temperature are important, then when the initially warmer water has cooled to an average temperature of 30C, it may look very different than the initially cooler water (at a uniform 30C) did at the start.  Why?  Because the water may have changed when it cooled down from a uniform 70C to an average 30C.  It could have less mass, less dissolved gas, or convection currents producing a non-uniform temperature distribution.  Or it could have changed the environment around the container in the refrigerator.  All four of these changes are conceivably important, and each will be considered separately below.

You can indeed have large 100,000 item collections without any hiccups or slowness. The issues people display here are if you have this 100k database downloaded on your browser which is unrealistic.<p>The second as to scalability user-wise. It is possible to scale meteor by altering some code. Meteor&#x27;s still a baby but their 1.0 release will definitely sort this out:<p>The issues relate to how publish functions are handled & how mongodb interacts with meteor. These will be heavily optimized by running publish functions less & using a mongodb replica set emulated via meteor or through mongodb&#x27;s oplog.<p>I have built before with .NET (I hate it the most), Java, Rails, PHP, Coldfusion, you name it!

6645511,comment,6641378,6642353,1,0,malandrew,,,"True. However I wonder if they could at least impose an embassy from which many forms of eavesdropping are not possible. i.e. US draws up floorplans and whatnot. The Germans modify those plans to make it into a giant Faraday cage will precisely defined inlets and outlets for water, gas, electricity, sewage, etc. Lastly all additions to the structure externally are to always inspected to make sure they don&#x27;t contain eavesdropping equipment.<p>This would at least force all eavesdropping and surveillance performed to be the same kind of eavesdropping and surveillance doable from US soil. Furthermore, the Germans can try to perform some form of enforcement on what types of people can show up at the embassy to work.<p>With biometrics and sharing between countries, it&#x27;s conceivable that one day you won&#x27;t be able to cross official borders with two identities ever again. This means that you effectively force someone to choose only one identity <i>forever</i>. That identity can either be one of your secret government identities or it can be your real identity, but it can no longer be both at different times. Once you choose, you&#x27;r stuck with that decision",1383199699
6645510,comment,6645283,6645283,3,0,ninkendo,,,"What I&#x27;ve never understood about this phenomenon, and what this article fails to clear up is: the phrase &quot;freezes faster&quot; is ambiguous.  It could be interpreted as hot water &quot;drops in temperature at a faster rate than cold water&quot;, or &quot;reaches 0C before cold water, if both placed in a freezer at the same time.&quot;<p>I would almost <i>certainly</i> think only the former interpretation makes sense.  Because hot water <i>becomes</i> cold water on its way to becoming ice.  So if I have two glasses of water, one at 20C and one at 30C, and I put them both in a freezer, the hot one may <i>cool down</i> faster, but how does it <i>overtake</i> the cooler one?  Because once the 30 glass cools down to 20, it should now be cooling at the same rate as the 20 one did when it was first put in the freezer... Right?",1383199697

Examining an early digital clock with 9-minute snooze could probably confirm that the 9 minutes is implemented using some smaller number of components than any 10-minute system could be.<p>I also vaguely recall that such on such clocks, the alarm itself (if not silenced) would tend to run for 9 minutes before self-silencing. The same logic might apply: it&#x27;s the longest finite interval that <i>doesn&#x27;t</i> require some sort of multi-digit carry-logic.<p>I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if early circuit layouts even made it so that the wiring to toggle some [digit  1] triggering state was shortest/cheapest, in a circular arrangement, compared to any other potential offset. (I don&#x27;t even think there was anything binary in the earliest digital-display clocks, rather some [10m, 6h, 24h] or even [10m, 6h, 12h, 2meridiem] cyclical counters.)",1383199482

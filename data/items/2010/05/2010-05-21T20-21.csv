All my accessories work with the dock connector including my car. I can still get software updates for my 3 year old iPhone 2G. Music & media players are superior to Android in my opinion along with it simply being easier to sync content. I can play my Audible books on my iPhone. Couldn't live without those. It's easier to buy an iPhone. There's basically just one model or the hold-over model from last year. With Android phones I feel like there's always something better right around the corner. I feel compelled to research CPU speed, RAM/ROM size, and evaluate the differences in software. I don't care for the physical buttons on Android phones. I think it's jarring to switch between the touch-screen and menu/home/search/back buttons which incidentally seem to be arranged differently on most Android handsets. I think the iPhone still has a pretty big app advantage especially for games and multimedia.",1274475518

The features debate is old and boring - maybe he cares, but I don't and I suspect that most iPhone buyers don't either.<p>And as developers, why should we be excited at a knockoff?  Do we need to punish Apple for being successful?  Unlike Microsoft, Apple has not tried to force people to run its OS.  And if Apple stops innovating the phone market, I don't see Google stepping up as a replacement.  Much as Microsoft did, I expect large market share to result in years of the same old crap.<p>I understand that some people don't like the situation they are in, and I'm okay with that.

Java solves this by only allowing references to ""the top of"" objects, and stopping you casting pointers.

Similarly, group selection explanations of why we age are held only by a handful of researchers in the field of aging.<p>Most biologists in the field of aging hold that aging is the result of the decreased force of natural selection with age.  This is somewhat difficult to explain even with diagrams, but I'll try anyway.<p>Let's imagine three forms of a gene.  One causes you to die at the age of eight, another causes you to die at eighty, and the third never causes you to die.  We would expect that the form of the gene that causes you to die at eight would be removed from the population very quickly, since anyone who has it will die before they can reproduce and pass it on.  In contrast, the gene that causes you to die at eighty will be rather prevalent, since by that age you'll have already passed on your genes to your progeny.  In fact, it will probably exist at about the same frequency as the gene that didn't cause you to die at all.<p>This is the mutation accumulation theory of aging.  Because natural selection acts more strongly early in life, we tend to accumulate genes with mutations that are detrimental later in life.  There's also a variant called antagonistic pleiotropy, where you have genes that have a beneficial effect early in life having a negative effect in old age.",1274473807

On the other hand, you then find yourself calling for MIL-STD-340985 sugar and MIL-STD-320598 flour and MIL-STD-24098 molasses with deviations allowed to items 4, 5, and 9 of paragraph 6 when using process B of MIL-STD-32409 Baking Instructions.

How many times have we been at this place in the history of biology, where we honestly believe that we are just ""that"" close to figuring out the processes of life.

You just clean up some of the damage and change some parts periodically so that it never reaches a threshold at which failure is possible.<p>Our bodies already do this quite well for the first 20-30 years of our lives, but after that, we're in an evolutionary blind spot and long-lived molecules accumulate and eventually make maintenance and repair mechanisms stop working for long enough to lead to pathologies.

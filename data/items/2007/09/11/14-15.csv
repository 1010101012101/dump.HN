53307,comment,53296,53296,0,0,pg,,,"I think most hackers already knew about YC before we made the news site, so I doubt it made us better known.

53304,comment,52807,53256,0,0,whacked_new,,,"Most speed reading courses are based on theories as solid as air. Peripheral vision does matter in comprehension, but that doesn't make them suited for the bulk of information processing, let alone rely on them. When you actually take in information from the periphery you usually piece it together from imperfect cues, which suffices for waffly material but won't work if you're reading a textbook. Duh, you say, but the amazing courses will tell you it works for everything, and people believe it!<p>The read-between-the-line thing, AFAIK, is just supposed to make your eyes backtrack less, which lessens fixations. More fixations = slower reading; it doesn't matter where you place your eyes.",1189521750

53302,comment,52807,52807,0,0,FatBastard,,,"They need to study the difference between familiar and unfamiliar words. They probably note this in the conclusion of the actual paper. I speculate that unambiguous and familiar words are recognized whole (in the same way a chess master recognizes the pattern of the whole board), and kids and adults finding a new or ambiguous word look at each letter and pause there to figure it out (like a chess novice looks at each piece and can only anticipate the next move).\nI hope this work isn't used as ammunition in the whole word vs phonetics holy war. \n",1189521331

Better/Worse applications? I was not aware of Y Combinator before the news feature. It is a good marketing case study.

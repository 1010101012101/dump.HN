I have been so for around 10 years.<p>I have noticed a rise in the view that administrative staff are an inevitable and unnecessary accretion within higher ed.<p>I find it hard to imagine the Campus network being built and maintained in the manner you propose. My area is information security. I equally cannot fathom faculty taking an interest in incident response duties, or dealing with network intrusion detection, or that kind of thing. We have seen what life is like without these functions. Quickly the Campus network is overrun with compromised devices, the rest of the world begins shunning the Campus address space, and the network becomes more and more unusable. This is, contrary to what we might hope, a full time responsibility. I cannot imagine any faculty who would be interested in dealing with PCI or HIPAA compliance in order to use credit cards, or run a health clinic or hospital.<p>Is there really no place for any kind of administrative staff? Once you let in and feed a few rats, they just breed, multiply and overrun the place?<p>I do find it troubling that I earn more than graduate student instructor or indeed many junior faculty. It is less than what I would make in private enterprise. I don&#x27;t know how to justify this, or indeed what the way to address it if indeed many staff positions are (as I believe) essential.<p>In the end, I am no longer interested in trying to answer this question. However much I might have believed in the mission of higher education has been eroded by my dislike of being increasingly considered vermin. I will be leaving higher ed, and take that even higher salary. This has, as I have observed at least at my University, increasingly been the path of the more skilled tech folks.",1420785965

He predicted that &quot;cybernetics&quot; and democracy would allow the number of creators to increase enormously, but posited that the number of actual &quot;geniuses&quot; was small, fixed, and already almost exhausted within the current artistic community. Therefore the signal (great art) would get lost in the noise (junk produced because it could be.)<p>There are issues with this view--it assumes that great art is an objectively real phenomenon rather than a contingent social creation, amongst other things--but a brief perusal of Amazon&#x27;s e-book offerings makes it hard to argue that the rate of creation has vastly outpaced the quality of creation. I daresay the same has happened with regard to music.<p>The great unsolved problem of the new era is criticism. Critics (who may have simply been record company flacs) acted as gatekeepers who allowed only material of a certain quality through.

  She was brought to the Prophet while she was still alive. Allah&#x27;s Apostle asked 
  her, &quot;Did such-and-such a person strike you?&quot; She raised her head, denying 
  that. He asked her a second time, saying, &quot;Did so-and-so strike you?&quot; She 
  raised her head, denying that. He said for the third time, &quot;Did so-and-so 
  strike you?&quot; She lowered her head, agreeing. Allah&#x27;s Apostle then sent for the 
  killer and killed him between two stones.

(Sahih Bukhari, Book 83, Number 16)<p>Islam/muslims (the Mughals to be exact) also hold the title of biggest massacre in history. The Mughal invasion of India was a massacre that lasted almost 1300 years and estimates of the death toll range from 60 million to 300 million people. Before the massacre India bordered Russia. Ironically a region of Afghanistan is still called &quot;Hindu Kush&quot; or massacre of Hindus.",1420783274

It&#x27;s more like Spock calling humans weak, stupid and illogical and not realizing that spock would have created windows and humans would create apple.   I&#x27;ve worked with the people sited in the original blog. Early on in this engineering department there were no titles. It was like a pack of dogs with no alpha dog. Wonder if you have ever seen that. All the dogs are yapping and nipping because no one knows who is the alpha dog. Later they enforced a full hierarchy. CTO, VP, 5 levels of engineers. After the imposition of titles things ran smoothly and quietly. Everyone fell in line. No more yapping or nipping (for better or worse - there was a lot of fear and lost lines of communication, lost design ideas from engineers who were too afraid to voice their insights) 
The original lack of titles IMO came from the fact that the main engineers (ie senior, ie architects) , coming from Sun DTrace and Fishworks, had felt that stupid execs at Sun and stupid product managers told them, the gods of engineering, what to do and those people were stupidly wrong  and they were always right. Now that they were out of Sun and in control of a brand new engineering team they were hell bent on keeping control since they were clearly the smartest beings around. They as the gods of coding should be the only product managers. They as the gods of coding should be the only architects.
Yes, titles make a difference for better or worse. Worse when they are not deserved and better when they point out that the senior person has more proven experience. When super smart junior engineer says you should use Mongo for your Bitcoin banking site and the senior engineer with 20 years of experience says you should use an ACID compliant database, you should use your senior engineers advice. Super smart junior people can often talk dangerously misguided intelligent circles around more senior calmer senior engineers. Titles can, in the best of cases, help direct the discussion.

37840,comment,37690,37690,0,0,staunch,,,"I'm surprised Mashable is pulling in so much. I've been a big fan Pete Cashmore because he really does what Arrington did in the beginning and without the strange attitude. Through no particular connection or authority he's done a really great job at keeping track of startup development. Arrington has become very slow and complacent in comparison. Glad to see it's paying off for Cashmore. The underdog wins again.\n",1185857110

37834,comment,37810,37811,0,0,jsjenkins168,,,"I also dont think the demands set by google were a brash mistake like this article suggests. <p>The general public is becoming more aware that the carrier's chokehold on them is stunting innovation and choice. The iPhone is a perfect example. When the iPhone was released, groves of people with existing contracts signed the 2yr AT&T contract anyway, but not without a feeling of bitterness. Everyone wants the Apple iPhone, not an AT&T phone. Everything AT&T about it is a downright annoyance.<p>Statements like the one made by Google over the spectrum restrictions reach the ears of the public. Google is saying: ""We will stop the telcos from raping you over the coals if the FCC will accept our rules to help you, the end user, by giving you freedom of choice"". I think now, more than ever before, people are standing up and demanding action like this. Google is shown as ""good cop"" who will help fight back the oppression that the telcos have imposed. <p>Regardless of the outcome of the 700Mhz auction, the carrier's restrictions will crumble, its just a matter of time. Just like Ma Bell and so many other examples in history, you can only hold back innovation and competition for so long. By making their stance known, Google is positioning themselves as the company who will be active to do things right, just like they have done in the internet space. <p>The issue at hand though is the importance of this spectrum in particular... Yes there are talks of utilizing the ""white space"" spectrums to get every inch out of available wireless freqencies (which Google is also interested in), but 700Mhz is the real meat. It is a BIG deal. Not only is it the last ""prime real estate"" that will likely come available in a long time, it is a lower frequency than the other wireless phone bands and therefore propagates better. Google owning this spectrum is far more important than internet search, and I know they realize it. I just hope they put their money where their mouth is because like the article suggests, now they have stirred up the bee hive by pissing off the carriers. ",1185855370
37833,comment,37810,37810,0,0,jey,,,"Summary: Google should bow down to the big telcos and not spend 2.86% to 6.22% of their market cap to open up a gigantic market because there's a danger that Google will hurt the telcos' feelings and cause the big telcos to no longer do special deals with Google.<p>Google is entrenched enough that they aren't going to wither and die just because they don't get preferential placement on the default landing page for the cell phone's browser. If Cringely is saying that the telcos would actually <i>block</i> Google, that would be an indicator of much bigger problems with the telco cartel.<p>Sounds like it's Cringely who needs to put down the crack pipe.",1185855260
37832,comment,37810,37810,0,0,avehn,,,"I think Cringely makes some valid points about the risks Google is taking but I think he is being overly paranoid. Even if he is not and the world is run by the telcos, I still say good on Google. Even if only some of the rules Google is proposing are adopted for this new frequency band we would be looking at a new way to network. A better way. An open way.",1185855238

Charlie Rose's ""Technology"" interviews are good. iInnovate, VentureVoice, IT Conversations, TalkCrunch, Scoble, TWiT, Diggnation.<p>VentureVoice is by far my favorite, but it's slowed to a trickle. There is just not much good content for people who like this stuff. I've listened to everything -- twice. I've had to resort to (gasp) reading on my commute most days, for lack of audio content.<p>Lots of great stuff in here: <a href=""http://wiki.ycombinator.com/presentations/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://wiki.ycombinator.com/presentations/</a> if you haven't listened to it yet.\n",1185855176

I would love to give away a phone which carries my applications on its ""desktop"" straight out of the box. Imagine the possibilities. Free cellular for anyone willing to purchase $200 bucks a month worth of widgets from my sponsor. <p>Talk to Verizon about an idea now and your sure to see your idea pooped on or stolen. An open system would let everyone have a hack, and talk about investors opening wallets for companies with ideas. Deja Vu, the internet reborn yet again....<p>\n",1185854710

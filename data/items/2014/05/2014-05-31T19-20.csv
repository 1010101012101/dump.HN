7827057,comment,7826633,7826822,4,0,yaur,,,"CCTV, as deployed today, really falls into to two categories.  By far the largest of these is people who own or lease private property who are installing cameras on their own property. There are some &quot;public private partnerships&quot; where LEO is tapping into these feeds but, at least in the system I built, there is significant auditing involved. In order to catch &quot;LOVEINT&quot; style snooping.  Typically though this footage goes completely unmonitored unless there is a incident though.<p>The second category is cameras that capture what would otherwise be &quot;in public view.&quot; These are systems where the cameras are clearly visible and mounted close to the ground. In the context of the law having a live detective monitor a suspects house is pretty much the same as putting up a camera that would be functionally identical, which is pretty much the same as putting up a 1000 cameras and doing LPR on every car that passes by.  If the feasibility of this kind of surveillance requires a change in the law is still an unresolved policy issue IMO.<p>With drones there are bigger issues. Because of elevation they are going to capture images of things that wouldn&#x27;t be &quot;in public view&quot; and would therefore typically require a warrant.  If these images were limited to the suspect there isn&#x27;t an issue, but of course they aren&#x27;t. The real kicker is going to be when someone figures out that they just need to add a $5K thermal sensor to the thing in order to net a couple incidental drug busts every time they need to track a suspect.  At that point they will become profitable to operate, usage will increase, and one of the current bright-line tests for when you need a warrant will become significantly fuzzier.<p>Don&#x27;t get me wrong. This type of technology is solving crimes that would otherwise be unsolved and helping people like Jianqing Klyzek protect themselves from police misconduct, but appropriate limits need to be put in place.  The efficiency of subservience technology is only going to increase. We can&#x27;t stop the world from innovating the only way to maintain a reasonable balance between privacy and safety is through policy and where to draw the line is definitely something that reasonable people can disagree on.",1401565905

Brian Smith (a mozilla security contributor) recently said the following in a discussion about adding support for invalid/self-signed certificates to the Firefox OS e-mail app.  The quote below can be found at the bottom of <a href=""https://groups.google.com/d/msg/mozilla.dev.platform/lT4Mhi-B1JI/2yRok8FDQroJ"" rel=""nofollow"">https://groups.google.com/d/msg/mozilla.dev.platform/lT4Mhi-...</a> noting that I think the first TLS is meant to be TLD.<p>&quot;Regarding DANE: Any TLS registry can apply to be a trust anchor in Mozilla&#x27;s CA program and we&#x27;ll add them if they meet our requirements. We can constrain them to issuing certificates that are trusted only for their own TLDs; we&#x27;ve done this with some CAs in our program already. Any CA can\ngive away free certificates to any subset of websites (e.g. any website within a TLD). Consequently, there really isn&#x27;t much different about the CA system we already have and DANE, as far as the trust model or costs are concerned.&quot;",1401565748

Having &quot;just a fraction of the ingredient on the labels&quot;, even if true, doesn&#x27;t automatically make a product &quot;clearly not safe&quot;.<p>The study referenced in the Forbes article doesn&#x27;t say how it <i>picked</i> which 44 products to study, which seems to be key to the question at hand. Was it a random sample? Was it a sample they had prior reason to suspect? Only if they&#x27;d picked products from the shelves of a specific retailer would it be a test of a retailer&#x27;s selection acumen. (The fact that a product is available from somebody <i>somewhere</i> doesn&#x27;t mean you&#x27;re likely to encounter it.)<p>They also don&#x27;t tell us which specific products were good or had problems so there&#x27;s no way for a 3rd party to check their results.

If the FDA gets more than a certain number of adverse reports they have no incentive to consider <i>how popular the product is</i> and do a cost-benefit analysis; as far as they&#x27;re concerned the &quot;benefit&quot; of a popular product counts as zero so <i>any</i> measurable risk is too high.<p>Weight loss supplements are particularly prone to being recalled due to risk levels that aren&#x27;t at all out of line with the potential benefit.",1401565740

Most of them don&#x27;t account for a specific type or situation, where someone is just not able to do a certain piece of work, without having a reason like lacking the time, health, skills or energy. These types are often just dismissed and dubbed underachievers, because, for some reason, they fail to acomplish tasks which they should be perfectly able to do. They procrastinate and do a million other things first or just give it up completely.<p>It doesn&#x27;t matter whether this task is about work, university grades, doing lab-experiments, the laundry or else.<p>== The theory ==<p>There is a austrian psychologist, Brigitta Rollett, who coined a term called &quot;Anstrengungsvermeidungsmotivation&quot; which translates to &quot;effort avoidance motivation&quot; or &quot;stress avoidance motivation&quot;.<p>The first essential postulate of the theory is, that having the &quot;motivation&quot; to avoid stress, or efforts that cause stress, isn&#x27;t an illness or failure, but rather an evolutionary advantage to prevent burnout and similar issues. All people tend to avoid activities, which cause them stress or more specifically the very basic emotion of disgust. People have different pattern and triggers which lead to the feeling of disgust. This is heavily primed by upbringing, schooling, bad experiences etc.\nYou seem to be disgusted by &quot;useless features&quot;. (I am too. :))<p>The second essential postulate of the theory is, that this disgust is more or less &quot;invisible&quot;. Most of the time it goes unnoticed.\nIt is such a strong emotion that people never even want to &quot;go near it&quot;, because it would cause them IMMENSE emotional pain. This pain can even translate to physical symptoms like head-aches etc.<p>This is how the afore-mentioned &quot;underachievers&quot; are explained. They don&#x27;t have a problem per se. As long as nobody forces them to do the specific tasks they don&#x27;t like to do, they live happily ever after.\nPeople with a high IQ tend to learn a lot of these &quot;disgust&quot; pattern, because on the one hand they are often confronted with teachers, who don&#x27;t understand them or meet them with antipathy and on the other hand they never needed to learn to deal with &quot;repulsive efforts&quot;. Contrary to most people they get by, without ever having really stressed themselves. Should they come into a situation, however, where they HAVE or WANT to deal with a task, which for them is linked to disgust, they fall into complete despair.\nThey do everything to get away from the triggered emotion.\nIt&#x27;s literally TERRIBLE for them to do some kinds of work, which aren&#x27;t a problem for most others.<p>There have been many scientific studies, tests and validations of this (in german).<p>== Your situation ==<p>First you have to acknowledge and understand that what you are experiencing is an irrational and immensely intense emotion.<p>Emotions don&#x27;t think. When you encounter one, you have to decide how to act on it. If your job sucks it&#x27;s probably a good idea to just work somewhere else.<p>But you like your job. In your case, the emotion just tells you that you HATE this type of work-situation.\nAnd for whatever reason you are not able to just acknowledge that, bite the bullet and move on. (Which is how people are able deal with most bad emotions.) In this particular case your brain throws one hell of a fit. Neurologically speaking and simplified, your rational forebrain looses control over your amygdala and the &quot;more emotional&quot; parts of your brain.<p>== What you can do ==<p>You can always make sure the situation never happens again, and avoid the dreaded tasks, but this probably won&#x27;t work without giving up programming.<p>What you have to apply are the same strategies which are needed to conquer other emotions-gone-wild like irrational fears.<p>~ You NEED to work on it SLOWLY but STEADY. ~<p>* The bad news: I hate to tell you this, but if you want to change your behaviour, you NEED to sit down and start doing the exact work which triggers this cascade.<p>* The good news: Each day, or session, you only need to conquer it ONCE.<p>Sit down for the task and start with the tiniest bit. Just open the first file. When you FIRST feel the terror overwhelming you, you HAVE to force yourself to keep at it and wrestle it down. When you feel the terror approaching a SECOND time, you can stop.\nIf you have the energy to continue, do it, but I doubt you will. Don&#x27;t stress yourself too much, or it will backfire. (You won&#x27;t)<p>This might sound incredibly stupid, but be proud of yourself at this point, because you have just delivered an immense piece of emotional work and it&#x27;s ok to be tired now.\nEven if you just typed three words.<p>Keep repeating this practise each day, twice a day or how you see fit, and slowly but steady the terror will fade. It will come slower, lighter, less often. If you keep doing this, i will GUARANTEE you that these shenanigans will stop. You will slowly replace the old neurological patterns which trigger your pain. (And pain is exactly what it is.)<p>Unfortunately there is no faster way for this. You can look into hypnotherapy, which can accelerate matters a bit, but working on emotions always takes it&#x27;s time. I have applied these techniques myself for a couple of situations. It was immensely exhausting, but it&#x27;s worth it and it works.<p>Good luck.",1401564403

My wife and I rarely make it out of there below that, and I&#x27;ve done it myself on at least one occasion.<p>That said, five cocktails in less than two hours is going to leave all but the stoutest alcoholics a lot worse for wear, and there are more and less flashy ways of running up such a tab. Of course, neither of us was there to witness this, and as I mentioned in another comment, I&#x27;m likely part of the problem.<p>Tangentially related, if you&#x27;re ever in Seattle and want tasty small plates and cocktails with a bit of showmanship to them (as well as a somewhat absurd scotch/bourbon menu), I&#x27;d highly recommend Canon :)",1401562838

Having the choice between download and DVD is much cheaper than any cartridge.  Or wait you&#x27;re talking about platforms?  There have always been multiplatform games.  And being multiplatform means you expand your audience perhaps 50% while using the same art assets and a lot of the same code; that doesn&#x27;t make a game&#x27;s price higher at all.  The amount of code you can share keeps rising, too.<p>So while games are prettier and more complicated, with art and animation getting crazily expensive, talking about convenience features like translations and downloads and patches is a red herring.",1401562802

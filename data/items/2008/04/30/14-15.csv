YouTube works fine, but Scribd doesn't work at all.  Doom is also pretty easy to get working, so that would honestly be better.<p>All in all, I can't read this article, because it's locked up in some proprietary crapware.  -1.",1209566869

However, like most everything else related to web browsers, you constantly have to deal with backwards computability across multiple browsers.  So this is just going to end up being ONE more thing that CSS coders have to be aware of.  Hurray for CSS variable adoption being available to 90% of browsers in 2015!",1209566053

177486,comment,176789,177157,0,0,justindz,,,"When I was earning my CS degree, my program was transitioning away from the ""liberal arts"" college towards the ""engineering"" college.  I came in on the tail end which still had more diversified course requirements.  As a consequence, I picked up a minor in philosophy and ended up I think three hours short of a minor in creative writing.<p>I've been very well served by this educational approach.  I absolutely do NOT use my philosophy of quantum physics topical material at work.  However, I do outperform some of my peers by having competent technical skills, competent people skills and the ability to work through very complex and abstract problems that have lead to generations of prior teams throwing up their hands in defeat.  These are things I attribute to a diverse education.<p>The people that coast through on a liberal arts degree, as you describe, are generally either coasting towards an entirely different type of life, enrolled in the wrong program (of their choosing) or the type of people that will end up succeeding regardless because they are talented, motivated, curious people.  All of which is to say that I think you are hitting too hard on liberal arts, but not to blame you for that because the program you've experienced might have just been crappy and not a good one from which to generalize the argument.",1209564699

177484,comment,177475,177475,0,0,brk,,,"Interesting, but I think it misses the point of the MBA.  Note the ""Ultra"" in the designator ""Ultra Portable"".  From the very beginning, the MBA has been positioned as a sort of elite machine for the portability crowd.<p>This video misses all that.  If you need to carry a DVD player and all that other gear with you all the time, then the MBA is probably not the machine for you.  Perhaps the Lenovo is, and for the Windows crowd it might represent the best ultra-portable choice.  Of course you are paying for the X300 in terms of size, weight and price.<p>To me, the X300 is more of a competitor to the standard MacBook, not the MacBook Air.  I think Lenovo's positioning of this is just an attempt to ride the coattails of the MBA's press.",1209564662

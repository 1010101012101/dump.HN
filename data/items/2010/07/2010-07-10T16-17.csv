Corruption and dysfunction in government and private industry are rampant, as are smaller-scale violations (most of the drivers are horrible and dangerous, lots of people butt in line, etc).  Basically, it's easy to get screwed.<p>Why?  I don't think it's because the people are inherently mean, because when you meet them, they're wonderful.  I think it's actually pretty simple.  In plain old evolutionary terms, the society selects for screw-you behavior and against cooperation.  If you're the best, nicest driver, your reward is that you never get where you're going.

1503934,comment,1503472,1503666,0,0,csmeder,,,"I agree, however, one suggestion would be to make content all left aligned. UX studies show the eye can scan much faster if everything is left aligned.<p><i>Most people find themselves using center alignment for these things. Why? The reason is three-fold:<p>It feels comfortable.
It’s a way to make these elements “stand out,” or to draw attention to them.
It’s what everyone else is doing.
Yes, center alignment does feel comfortable. And quite frankly, it will be more than a mite uncomfortable to break away from using it. But it interrupts the flow of people who are scanning when their eye has to jump to a section in the middle of the page. As a matter of fact, your readers may be intentionally skipping over those center-aligned headings and subheadings that we all know are such an integral part of web site copy. GASP!<p>Here’s a suggestion. Instead of using center alignment to make your heading, subheadings, etc. stand out, align them to the left and use a larger and bolder font size for them. Using a different color is also a consideration, but use caution. Colored text can also cause readability issues.<p>Sure, everyone else is center aligning like crazy. That means a lot of web sites are difficult to read and causing unnecessary eyestrain on their poor visitors. But by left aligning your text, you’ll keep your web site visitors blissfully reading and sticking around, which is exactly where you want them.</i><p>-- <a href=""http://www.learntodoitright.com/2009/01/14/how-text-alignment-affects-online-readability/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.learntodoitright.com/2009/01/14/how-text-alignmen...</a>",1278780701

My hours of daily casual computing have moved from the office to the living room, kitchen, and deck, something that hasn't happened before even with both a 15 inch and an 11 inch laptop in the home. My girlfriend loves it too, and will grab it from me to pull up a recipe, do a quick search, etc.<p>It has also proven to be a more-than-capable gaming device running everything from casual match 3 games through light strategy (Strategery is a must) on to board games we can play together (Small World and Carcassone are also musts.)<p>On the work side, I use it often for background reading  (the Apple HIG from front to back, for example, and that isn't a short document), quick bits of research, etc. whether at the desk or as a chance to get away from it for a little while.<p>One of the best things about it has to be its ability to disappear during use, leaving you sitting or standing with the <i>application</i> in your hands, not a device. Or at least it seems that way, and that is certainly not something that laptops or desktops (or even handheld or living-room-bound game consoles) do particularly well if at all. That you can then set that application down on a table for a moment or hand it to someone else so naturally is something that you will have heard about the iPad but really must experience for yourself a few times to truly understand it. It seems like a small thing but it fundamentally changes one's relationship with computing and the computer.<p>The iPad can't and won't replace traditional computers for everyone, but from what I have seen and have heard from other purchasers it is certainly proving itself as a device that can replace <i>most</i> 'casual'/'personal' usage of traditional computers for <i>most</i> people <i>most</i> of the time.",1278780143

1503882,comment,1502099,1503636,0,0,JabavuAdams,,,"At one point, I started writing a 3D game engine in Python, with the understanding that I'd profile and if necessary re-write the necessary parts.<p>I've also used Panda3D, which has a lot of Python-wrapped C++ code.<p>Now, I don't have specific benchmarks to point to, but it's important not ""prematurely pessimize"", just as it's important not to optimize prematurely. In high-performance 3D games, you'd switch compilers for say a 10% gain in optimized code performance.<p>Ever since I've become aware of how deep the GIL problems go, I can't really justify starting to write an engine in Python, if I'm just going to have to re-write critical and error-prone parts in C++ anyway.<p>There's a more general principle here that applies to languages and runtimes, as well as library design. You want to be able to get started with a new component or language / runtime easily, trading ease of use for performance, BUT as the project progresses you want a way to be sure that you could beat-down or recover from any problems in a way that doesn't essentially require a re-write.<p>These GIL issues remove that confidence in Python, for me. It's not a win if I can only write the easy parts of my code in Python. I specifically want to use Python to write the hard parts of my code.<p>I agree that there doesn't seem to be an easy, or even moderately difficult solution to this problem. That makes it even worse from the point of view of advocating Python use on a project.<p>To summarize, it's reasonable to say ""don't optimize until you know there's a problem"", but you can come at it the other way from a risk-management perspective. ""What is the risk that there's some dead-end due to this language / runtime that we just won't be able to overcome (because the smartest dudes who know the language inside-out, can't fix it either).""",1278778938

If I'm honest, though, despite my ideals being that I want a significant proportion of my money to go to charity, actually forcing myself to part with it directly is a real challenge (particularly thanks to the procrastination that I, like so many people, exhibit in such situations).  Personally, I find the level of abstraction provided by the government to be helpful: I'm much more able to say that I want the government to spend money in certain areas, even if it means raising my taxes, than I am able to just hand money to a cause.<p>I'm a much more rational spender of money I've already given to the government than I am of my own.

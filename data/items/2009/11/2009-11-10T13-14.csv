When I studied, I noticed many interdisciplinary connections.  Fields like mechanic, electronic, logic, automatic, programming, often look like two sides of the same coin.<p>However I also noticed an inability from others to see the damn connections. If you present the same thing from another angle, they often fail to see it as the same thing, while I factor the obvious pattern like you would code (I've seen it in the case of 3D vision).<p>The consequences are quite catastrophic: the languages (jargon) used to describe each discipline diverge, making it even more difficult to notice the similarities.  This convince even more people that there <i>isn't</i> any connection. That the situation is like a tree. At this point, they don't even bother to seek the connections, and we end up with a disconnected mess.<p>> This vision makes me wonder when mathematics will reach a point where mastering the material required to understand a leaf node will take greater than the average life span.<p>That can't happen: more time to study relevant material means less time to push further. It will take many geniuses to be able to learn and push fast enough.  But this is pointless. If it takes you a lifetime to learn a particular field, that field will simply fall into oblivion.  So, the geniuses (at least the one worth mentioning) won't push further. They will simplify their field, <i>reducing</i> the time required to learn it.",1257860522

Peoplesofts UI is shit, in my opinion, but then I'm only the  guy trying to book his holiday with it, rather than the HR people who bought it. What it offers them is an integrated solution. I assume it plugs into payroll etc. It also does expenses, yearly appraisal, yadda yadda. I don't know how you're going to compete with that.",1257858583

Heck, you can even download a freaking PDF with the results.<p>Sure, html tables would be nicer (and more elegant) than the images WA creates (but because of all the mathematical stuff you can output they had to design a system that generates images anyway and just decided to use it for everything).

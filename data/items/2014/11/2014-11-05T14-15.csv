8562004,comment,8561080,8561735,0,0,rakoo,,,"> People actually like to work - to feel useful.<p>There is this common misconception that basic income will make everyone stay home and do nothing useful. I think it&#x27;s completely wrong, people (most of them) will continue to work; the huge difference is that they will not do it for the money, but for the actual effect it has. Your example shows it. You can also ask yourselves if chefs, musicians, programmers, mechanics would just grab the money and stay home; I don&#x27;t believe so. Only those who do their job purely for revenues will stop... At least, that&#x27;s my prediction (and hope). In other words, useless jobs (as in, not useful for others) will vanish.",1415199599

Some people really enjoy getting that alcohol buzz after a stressful day at work. Tradition would be like only going to a specific bar that one coworker can&#x27;t go to or something. You aren&#x27;t comparing apples to oranges. You are expecting people to change their personal habits because another coworker may not approve of them. That is a dangerous slope to begin down....<p>Its outside of work. Your own convictions and interests should dictate what you do outside of work. There are more differences between drinking beer at a bar and drinking non alcoholic drinks at a starbucks. People are going to enjoy them separately and unfortunately, for many people, the activities are not interchangeable. I personally don&#x27;t drink, but I would never suggest to co-workers that they change their outside of work habits because I don&#x27;t want to go to a bar.<p>It&#x27;s clearly different if its a work sponsored event.",1415199580

8561996,comment,8559519,8559519,0,0,protonfish,,,"This is not a great article and is resistant to criticism by virtue of its excessive length. Still, I&#x27;ll try to point out some major flaws.<p>1. Single page apps have many drawbacks that are conveniently not mentioned: Slow load time, memory bloat, persistence of state on reload, corruption of state and others. SPAs are just another misguided attempt at making web apps more like desktop apps. Web apps are network applications - if you remove the network communications portion, what is the point of them?<p>2. JS is a great tool to make pages more responsive. This has been the case for years and I am lost on why the author writes on and on about it without any poignant observations or facts.<p>3. Using push (web sockets) is a valuable tool for accomplishing particular features. This does not mean that more is better and we should start using it for everything. Server pull is a strong feature of the web and is arguably a key to much of its success.<p>4. Ajax is great, no argument.<p>5. Saving state as a hash value in the URL not only puts JS actions into history, but makes them visible and bookmarkable as well. Push state is a quagmire.<p>6. The need to push code updates is one of the problems caused by SPAs that is not needed in normal web apps. Even so, this could be solved with a decent, as yet unimplemented, application cache.<p>7. Predicting actions is overkill. If you focused on doing everything else well, there is no need to add significant amounts of complication. More code = poorer performance and decreased maintainability.",1415199572

8561993,comment,8557609,8561865,0,0,edwintorok,,,"Well -- &#x27;no attack surface&#x27; might be simplifying things a bit too much, as you do need a way to interact with the hypervisor or the privileged host to actually get your data written to disk and your network packets out on the wire.
Each such interaction can contain bugs, some of which might be exploitable.<p>Even with Xen or KVM you do have an attack surface:<p>* guests can send network packets to the host, which interacts with the networking code on the host. If exploitable you get to execute code/DoS the host. Hopefully not because then so could any other remote machine.<p>* guests can execute instructions which get emulated / need extra privilege checks done in the hypervisor. See recent vulnerability regarding MSR registers in Xen.<p>* guests execute hypercalls which obviously interacts with the hypervisor. Bugs here, if exploitable, can be nasty.<p>* guests need to read/write their data to disk. Are we sure they can&#x27;t read the data of a (possible already deleted) other VM?<p>* guests read/write from memory ... was the memory of previously deleted/crashed/migrated guests properly scrubbed? Can any of the hypercalls/etc. be used to read another guest&#x27;s memory, or access uninitialized memory containing pieces from old guests?<p>...<p>Of course the attack surface of a hypervisor is smaller than that of a full kernel (where you also have a lot of syscalls, disk formats, etc.), but that doesn&#x27;t mean hypervisors are suddenly bulletproof.<p>I think this quote sums it up quite well: <a href=""http://marc.info/?l=openbsd-misc&m=119318909016582&w=2"" rel=""nofollow"">http://marc.info/?l=openbsd-misc&m=119318909016582&w=2</a>. Also have a look at the PDF referenced in that thread.<p>The question is where does LXD stand from a security pov. between these simplified categories (no order implied):<p>- running multiple different processes as same user<p>- running processes in different LXC containers as root-in-container on same host<p>- running processes in different LXC containers as non-root on same host<p>- running multiple processes as different users<p>- running processes in different LXC containers as non-root on same host<p>- running root processes in different KVM VMs on same host<p>- running non-root processes in different KVM VMs on same host<p>- running root processes in different Xen/domU VMs on same host<p>- running non-root processes in different Xen/domU VMs on same host<p>- ...<p>Or in other words if you get an account/container/VM on a shared machine from a hosting provider using technology X, how does that compare to getting an LXD container from a hosting provider?
(provided that other unknown users can run LXD containers on the same machine as yours).",1415199534

I also think that a working class with more time on their hands would inevitably become more organised with increased class conciousness as a side-effect.<p>So basically the idea is that less working time may be a &quot;slipperly slope&quot; that goes against the interests of the ruling class both in the short-term and even more so in the long-term.<p>The second statement is, as I understand it, that this is not driven by some organised unit of capitalist but rather by the idea that the higher classes are more aware of what is in their interests that no central organisation is needed.",1415198023

I hope it is ok. Here is what I can&#x27;t agree on:
1. From the very sentence above my understanding is that you notice something very important here: is it that in your opinion democracy doesn&#x27;t work? You see this point you make isn&#x27;t about capitalism. It&#x27;s all about Democracy. Your claim here is that (sorry for vulgar interpretation): democracy doesn&#x27;t work because I see elections after elections that voters vote for guys with most money for the campaign. But that&#x27;s issue with democracy. Not capitalism. As long as money exists, rich&poor exist -- democracy won&#x27;t be perfect. I take different view than that on this. I think you need more than just money to kind of &quot;cheat&quot; in democracy. You need stupid populous too. You need dumb people who care just about 6-packs and entitlements. So whoever promises them the most for the vote casted, gets elected. And then that gets funded by cheap credit, forever low interest rates (FED) and public spending. No wonder both parties do the same. This is late stages of democracy though. Not issue with capitalism. Last time I checked capitalism worked fantastic for a country - namely China -- but without the fallacies of democracy.
2. You are not the only one who notices that. US Government noticed that as well. And compared to China, it seems democracy and capitalism aren&#x27;t as effective as authoritarian system and capitalism. It&#x27;s not only China. Look at South-East Asia in general. If you ask, why we have more militarization of police, huge prison population, NSA eavesdropping, etc, etc -- it&#x27;s all about the elites in the US seeing on the example of China that democracy doesn&#x27;t really work. 
3. Another issue with the statement: would you voted for Hitler given he had the most money in elections in 1933 ? Right, democracy isn&#x27;t idiot-proof. That&#x27;s the real problem with it. You can&#x27;t really let 6-pack-joe voting, that&#x27;s idiotic notion. Again, nothing to do with capitalism.<p>>Add to that the fact that no ordinary citizen directly voted for the bailouts, how can you blame this on the voter? The problem is not the voter, but the system.<p>Democratic system that is. Ordinary citizen not knowing how to vote. Poor idiots. Almost like Jews voting for NSDAP. (Sorry, couldn&#x27;t help myself). Your disbelieve in American voters is mind blowing! The distrust in democracy horrifying!<p>EDIT: voted <-> voting ; stop <-> help",1415197914

Everywhere I went in the hospital the cleaning and cooking staff was black and everyone else was white.  At least in the area I was in.  I was hanging out in a lounge area once and there was a group of older guys.  One was telling a joke and used the N-word several times.  A few feet away there was a black guy cleaning the floor.  It seemed like a skit in some comedy show.  I looked around and no one gave a shit but me.<p>Everywhere I went in the hospital, when I would encounter black people, they would never look me in the eye.  Always their eyes were down and they called me &quot;sir.&quot;  I was like 34 and no one had ever addressed me like that.

Interruptible and composable. My lib and most libs I&#x27;ve seen are geared toward this.<p>- API for transitioning in/out and moving around. This is the actual hard part that TransitionGroup is trying to tackle. How do you express an &quot;animating out&quot; API (that&#x27;s also interruptible?) when the item doesn&#x27;t exist anymore at the next render? Can you stop the component from unmounting midway, and potentially bring it back through an &quot;un-unmounting&quot; API? I haven&#x27;t seen a library that actually tackles this problem. We can debate about a good API all we want for animation but as long as this problem isn&#x27;t solved, the whole animation problem isn&#x27;t imo.<p>These two are separate issues. Ideally I think you should pull out the velocity part and create a wrapper API around it, and solve transitioning in/out independently.<p>(I&#x27;m actively searching for solutions, so please ping me in #reactjs if you have good ideas.

As a white dude I&#x27;ve met and worked with a lot of really weird white dudes over the decades, and thats apparently ok.  She met ONE weird white dude, ONE!, and that&#x27;s a big problem solely because she&#x27;s a black woman.  I&#x27;m not impressed.  I&#x27;m not saying weirdos are good or correct or shouldn&#x27;t be punished, but I am saying that trying to portray weirdos as as &quot;a black women problem&quot; is extremely inaccurate.  They are a PITA for us all, or there exist PITA weirdos that affect every ethnic or social group.  And to be honest, management and HR are utterly ineffective at weeding out weirdos regardless if the people offended are white dudes or black women, which is fairness, in a way.<p>I&#x27;d argue that dealing with weirdos is an adult social skill.  So a long time ago I sat next to a guy with a severe temper problem who would scream at me occasionally, usually just nonsense although sometimes I admit I&#x27;d provoke him a bit.  Well, it was not exactly paradise, but I&#x27;m a big boy so its &quot;OK&quot;.

The ideal social interaction system might be all candy and balloons and girl scout songs all the time but adults can and should handle something a bit worse, a bit more realistic.

And, on the other hand, the feeling that work is a moral value in itself, and that anyone not willing to submit themselves to some kind of intense work discipline for most of their waking hours deserves nothing, is extraordinarily convenient for them.</i><p>This has always bothered me, even before I was old enough to join the &quot;work force.&quot; I had a hunch back in the day and have subsequently confirmed it early in my career: working less promotes better, clearer thinking, and ultimately a higher volume of results (i.e. when I work less, I end up getting more done).<p>This is incredibly telling of our times:<p><i>Hell is a collection of individuals who are spending the bulk of their time working on a task they don’t like and are not especially good at. Say they were hired because they were excellent cabinet-makers, and then discover they are expected to spend a great deal of their time frying fish. Neither does the task really need to be done – at least, there’s only a very limited number of fish that need to be fried. Yet somehow, they all become so obsessed with resentment at the thought that some of their co-workers might be spending more time making cabinets, and not doing their fair share of the fish-frying responsibilities, that before long there’s endless piles of useless badly cooked fish piling up all over the workshop and it’s all that anyone really does.</i><p>I encounter this more often than I&#x27;d like to admit. Brilliant, talented, positive people finding their core competencies squashed under meaningless political bullshit. I constantly shudder at the idea of what these people might accomplish if they were given the resources and freedom to do what they were actually good at.<p>I&#x27;ve been reading Freedom From the Known by Jiddu Krishnamurti and this one excerpt really speaks to this problem:<p><i>For centuries we have been spoon-fed by our teachers, by our authorities, by our books, our saints. We say, `Tell me all about it - what lies beyond the hills and the mountains and the earth?&#x27; and we are satisfied with their descriptions, which means that we live on words and our life is shallow and empty. We are second-hand people. We have lived on what we have been told, either guided by our inclinations, our tendencies, or compelled to accept by circumstances and environment.

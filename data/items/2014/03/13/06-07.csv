It should work for any opengl app (the example they use is a simple gl app that draws some spheres). When the app makes an opengl call, it logs it to tmp before forwarding it on to the real opengl library. It&#x27;s kind of like strace for graphics...<p>Then, there are tools to analyze and inspect those logs. You can presumably replay a frame, and step through each GL call and inspect the data it is sending. I haven&#x27;t tried building this yet, but it looks like it includes a tool to replay the GL calls, and some kind of interactive GUI.",1394693904

7390293,comment,7389191,7390164,1,0,ehsanu1,,," Unlike with nukes (Project Orion notwithstanding), having access to relativistic weapons also implies having access to space travel. This is not necessarily the case, especially given biological constraints, but let&#x27;s assume you have space travel.<p>Well, then you are also spread out, and given enough time, you spread throughout a galaxy. With that level of spread, the safety in numbers and distribution over a large space is a form of strong defense against relativistic weapons from other civilizations.<p>Furthermore, the technology for these weapons may also open up avenues for defense, even if such is not the case for nuclear weapons. Consider a relativistic missile detection system that continually scans for incoming missiles and is able to quickly accelerate its own for head-on collisions. Granted, there&#x27;s not much notice. But let&#x27;s say you have missiles at 0.99c - quite fast - and a light year away (would any closer be plausible for a launch? Maybe with relativistic ICBMs... or ISBMs rather). By my non-relativistic calculations, that gives you almost 90 hours to prepare countermeasures.<p>A &quot;simpler&quot; countermeasure is just to go overboard with the spreading idea. Simply live on millions of asteroids with your advanced propulsion tech slapped on. When a relativistic threat is detected, each asteroid is nimble enough to get out of the way, and if some are still hit, it&#x27;s a small loss.<p>Though, the attacker could just shoot many smaller, faster missiles dispersed over a wide area. Not civilization-annihilating now, unless it was overwhelming in number, but still painful.",1394691725

7390272,comment,7389940,7390152,40,0,jdlshore,,,"This. So much this.<p>I got involved with Extreme Programming in 2000. Loved it. Best thing since sliced bread, yadda yadda. I was completely spoiled for other kinds of work.<p>So when that contract ended, I went looking for other opportunities to do XP. But guess what? In 2001, there weren&#x27;t any. So I started teaching people how to do it. Bam! I&#x27;m a consultant.<p>Several lean years later (I don&#x27;t mean Lean, I mean ramen), I&#x27;m figuring out this consulting thing. I&#x27;ve got a network, I&#x27;ve got a business entity, people actually call me, and oh, oh, and I make a real damn difference.<p>Then Agile starts getting really popular. Certification starts picking up. Scrum&#x27;s the new hotness, XP&#x27;s too &quot;unrealistic.&quot; I start noticing some of my friends in the biz are dropping out, going back to start companies or lead teams or something <i>real</i>. But I stick with it. I&#x27;m thinking, &quot;Sure, there&#x27;s some bottom feeders creeping in, but Agile&#x27;s still based on a core of people who really care about doing good work. Besides, if we all leave, what will keep Agile on track?&quot;<p>It gets worse. Now I&#x27;m noticing that there are certain clients that simply won&#x27;t be successful. I can tell in a phone screen. And it&#x27;s not Scrum&#x27;s fault, or certification, or anything. It&#x27;s the clients. They want easy. I start getting picky, turning them down, refusing to do lucrative but ineffective short-term training.<p>Beck writes <i>XP Explained 2nd edition</i>. People talk about Agile &quot;crossing the chasm.&quot; I start working on the 2nd edition <i>XP Pocket Guide</i> with chromatic and it turns into <i>The Art of Agile Development</i>. We try to write it for the early majority—the pragmatics, not the innovators and early adopters that were originally attracted to Agile and are now moving on to other things. It&#x27;s a big success, still is.<p>It gets worse. The slapdash implementations of Agile now outnumber the good ones by a huge margin. You can find two-day Scrum training everywhere. Everybody wants to get in on the certification money train. Why? Clients won&#x27;t send people to anything else. The remaining idealists are either fleeing, founding new brands (&quot;Software Craftsmanship&quot;), or becoming Certified Scrum Trainers.<p>I write &quot;The Decline and Fall of Agile&quot; [1]. Martin Fowler writes &quot;Flaccid Scrum&quot; [2]. I write &quot;Stumbling through Mediocrity&quot; [3]. At conferences, we early adopters console each other by saying, &quot;The name &#x27;Agile&#x27; will go away, but that&#x27;s just because practices like TDD will just be &#x27;the way you do software.&#x27;&quot; I start looking very seriously for other opportunities.<p>That was six years ago.<p>...<p>Believe it or not, things haven&#x27;t really gotten worse since then. Actually, they&#x27;ve gotten a bit better. See, 2-5 years is about how long a not-really-Agile Agile team can survive before before things shudder to a complete halt. But not-quite-Agile was Actually. So. Much. Better. (I know! Who could believe it?) than what these terribly dysfunctional organizations were doing before that they&#x27;re interested in making Agile work. So they&#x27;re <i>finally</i> investing in learning how to do Agile well. Those shallow training sessions and certifications I decried? They opened the door.<p>And so here we are, 2014. I see these &quot;Agile is dying&quot; threads as a good thing. Because they mean that the word is getting out about Agile-in-name-only. Because every time this comes up, you have a horde of people saying &quot;Yeah! Agile sucks!&quot; But... BUT... there&#x27;s also a few people who say, &quot;No, you don&#x27;t understand, I&#x27;ve seen Agile work, and it was <i>glorious</i>.&quot; That&#x27;s amazing. Truly. I&#x27;ve come to believe that no movement survives contact with the masses. After 20 years, to still have people who <i>get it</i>? Who are benefiting? Whose lives are being changed?<p>That means we have a shot.<p>And as for me... I found that opportunity, so I get to be even more picky about where I consult. But I continue to fight the good fight. Diana Larsen and I have produced Agile Fluency [4], a way of understanding and talking about the investments needed. We&#x27;ve released it, permissive license, for everyone to use. Use it.<p>Because Agile has no definition, just a manifesto. It is what the community says it is. It always has been.

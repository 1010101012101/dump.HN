If you swap that light-water plant to an advanced heavy water plant like CANDU, that multiplier goes up to about 2 000 000 times. A fun fact: the extractable amount of energy in the trace radioactive elements (notably thorium) that is dug up with coal (and mostly distributed into the environment) is several times higher than the extractable energy content of the coal.",1329216978

With a proper session token, but invalid credentials, the request fails with HTTP 400: ""__type: com.amazon.coral.service#InvalidSignatureException, message: The request signature we calculated does not match the signature you provided. Check your AWS Secret Access Key and signing method. Consult the service documentation for details."". Amazon still checks the signature. The same logic that could be used for IAM credentials that don't expire, without the need to check for a valid session token. If it is an Amazon screw up, that static credentials take more time to evaluate vs temporary credentials - that's not out fault. It is a pure Amazon screw up. The signing logic is still there for every API call. So (apparently?) we're back to square one: extra requests and wrapper logic for zero benefits, and worse overall experience. The session credentials aren't stateful. I specifically checked for this behavior. Therefore what you say, doesn't seem to happen in reality.<p>And for the love of God, don't blindly trust the documentation / what the AWS folks say.

We also had lawyers in the ministry of justice who without blinking an eye issued laws which later were proven illegal by the high court.\nFrom a politician I expect a clear political vision and use expert knowledge to find the best way to achieve these goals. The necessary expertise can be acquired by, uh, experts which has to be done most often anyway as the minister himself does not usually have the time or specialization to deal with specific complex issues.

However, that seems like a false choice to me. Brainstorming is often used to solve a problem now; you don't always have time to wait for something genius to emerge (which might not even be related to your problem). Brainstorming tries to emulate that situation by having people interact more.<p>That said, in my experience the quality of a brainstorm session depends a lot on who are participating and/or who is facilitating. I find brainstorming works well when the problem space is clearly defined and people with different functions or backgrounds participate. As the article says on the interaction between Chomsky and Halle: We became great friends, Halle says. And friends shouldnt be shy about telling each other when they are wrong. What am I supposed to do? Not tell him hes got a bad idea? For this to work, people shouldn't be afraid to tell each other things that can be shot down. For friends this is natural, but for random people put together in a team it often isn't.<p>In a way I think brainstorming is a way to simulate the sort of discussion that would take place in a group that the article refers to as having a high Q. This means both feeling free to give your opinion, but also leaving room for discussion. Maybe brainstorming focuses a little too much on the former, though in my experience a good facilitator will also stimulate discussion. Personally I'm planning to look into the 'debating' technique the article describes as well.",1329213632

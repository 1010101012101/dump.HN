That's alright then, but still leaves you with an entirely unjustified conclusion.<p>As to your second point, you brought Tiki bars up. I don't think Tiki bars feature prominently in the definitions of beaches in the scientific literature but that doesn't really matter. What matters is that the distribution of Tiki bars (and other properties they might have) is accessible to the scientific method. You can't claim that your definition of ""beach"" which apparently includes Tiki bars is not accessible to science (at least with the examples you gave for extending the definition).",1306789173

Ultimately the only test for your startup idea is market acceptance and resonance  - and experience repeatedly shows that no amount of prior experience and knowledge helps in predicting correctly what the next big thing will be.  After the fact, it is easy to look back and rationalize and attribute certain factors for all the big successes - but no matter how many times this happens,  we always miss the next big thing.

2600395,comment,2594153,2598779,1,0,lucasjung,,,"Interesting.  AoA probes are one way to provide stall warning, but I wasn't aware that's what Airbus used on the A-330.  They also have other uses.  There are also other ways to provide stall warning such as directly sampling flow over the wings (as I mentioned previously).  Most light props actually use a very crude version of this.  For example, the stall warning on the Cessna I flew my first few hours in was a horn on the lower part of the leading edge.  In an impending stall scenario, the pressure over that part of the wing would go negative, sucking air out through the horn and causing it to sound.<p>AoA vanes actually do work on different principles than pitot probes.  The newer, fancy-schmancy ones use a whole bunch of tiny ports, each measuring pressure at different angles, and a computer interprets the results to give AoA.  On older planes (including the one I have the most experience in), it's literally a vane, as in ""weather vane:"" it rotates into the direction of the relative airflow, so whatever angle it is at relative to horizontal is the AoA.<p>Even if the AoA system <i>did</i> work on the same principle, the more important point is that it's a separate system, meaning that a failure in the pitot-static system would not cause a failure in the stall warning system.<p>EDIT: from the picture you linked, the AoA vanes on an A-330 are of the type I'm more accustomed to: literal vanes that rotate into the airflow.",1306788393

2600386,comment,2595605,2599444,2,0,lionhearted,,,"> Basically, you need the site to provide you with restraints to overcome your self control problems?<p>Hah! Fair question, but I don't think that's it.<p>Here's an actual example - I wrote a detailed comment about the evolution of a certain field and then I linked to resources for people who want to learn more.<p>This guy who is a bit of a knucklehead replies, ""This is wrong, you shouldn't get your info from Wikipedia"" - actually, he was mistaken and I knew what I was talking about. But if his (incorrect on both counts) comment was voted higher than mine, it would make sense to reply to it to clarify.<p>Another example is when someone mis-summarizes something to put words in your mouth. If it gets voted up by chance a little, it's a self perpetuating thing where it looks accurate. If there's no points, everyone has to evaluate it critically and then, that's fine.<p>Like you say right here, points sort of signal quality. There's an implication that if one comment is at +5 and there's a reply at +15 saying ""You're mistaken"", then the +15 comment is correct. If someone is being a jerk and incorrect, it's a lot easier to ignore them when they don't have a seemingly-legitimate blessing.<p>> The arguments I see for hiding of the points seem to revolve around solving personal issues people have. ... I want to be clear, I'm being fairly straightforward above. I'm not intending to attack you. If I was too succinct and it came off too harsh, please forgive me. Your comment was a good one, and I don't want you offended by what I wrote. =)<p>No offense, absolutely a valid and good comment. Anyways, I see what you're getting at, but I don't think it's a personal self control thing so much as -<p>1. People respond to incentives and signals.<p>2. An incorrect comment that's highly voted up puts out the signal that its correct and authoritative.<p>3. If someone replies to you and says ""you're wrong and an idiot"" <i>and</i> there's an external signal that they're correct, there's a very natural incentive to reply to that.<p>4. Whereas if people are forced to use critical thinking and evaluate comments on their own merits, the external signal is removed, and a lot of the incentive to reply (clearing up that you're not, in fact, wrong and an idiot as apparently signaled by this highly-voted comment) is no longer there.<p>I guess you could spin that as being about personal things, but I don't think that's it - a lot of veteran commentors who are seemingly very self-controlled people (tptacek, patio11, etc) have responded along similar lines. When someone says something nasty and incorrect about you and there's a public signal that it's correct, there's a very natural incentive to reply which is largely removed by this change.",1306788181

So it'll be very difficult to capture anything but still-life images because the small aperture means a long exposure time, and thus motion blur if anything moves.  Granted this is already less of an issue with Kinect because the sensor in it is so tiny that getting out-of-focus areas is not that much of a concern, but the cost of that is that the image resolution is also atrocious.<p>Once you get up to usable sensor resolutions, if you're already limited to taking long exposures of still-life images on a tripod, you might as well skip the IR depth perception and just take a series of wider aperture pictures at different focus plane levels, focus stack the results and preprocess the image series for blur levels to work out the relative depths of the in-focus bits of each source image.  At least doing it that way you can use a DSLR to get quality photos.<p>Neither of these is a true replacement for what they are doing here, though.",1306786001

But today, despite our best efforts, what we know for certain about these laws is no more than what we knew back in the 1970s.<p>How unusual is it for three decades to pass without major progress in fundamental physics?

2600279,comment,2599806,2599806,43,0,ChuckFrank,,,"I've been waiting for some time to call out Airbnb, and I think this is the right time.<p>Firstly, the idea of short term residential rentals is not new.  Long before Airbnb major cities, Paris, London, New York, and Toronto were dealing with the issues and the problems of short term / nightly residential rentals.  In fact the latest condo boom in Toronto has been ascribed to international investors buying condos explicitly for this quasi-hotel rental market.  Many cities have been passing local laws trying to prohibit this type of rental use for residences because they carry a whole host of problems. Some of those include -- emptying the downtown core of residences, artificially increasing housing costs for residents, removing the stability and security that comes from having permanent and community-invested residents, shorting cities on their hotel taxes, providing unlicensed locations for short term illicit activities, etc. So by increasing the market in these short term rentals, the communities will also feel the increase in the unfortunate side effects of these short term rental impacts.  These are long term market problems that Airbnb will have to address.<p>Secondly, it's not a new idea because in the recent past, these rentals were managed by hotel brokers. So in that respect, Airbnb major idea is simply to replace the traditional broker that used to handle the short term rentals with a direct owner to renter model.  Across the internet we see great success in online services removing brokerage inefficiencies to various markets, and for this they should be congratulated, but not overly so.<p>And finally, about their execution.  Airbnb is not the market leader.  In fact --<a href=""http://www.vrbo.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.vrbo.com/</a> is.  This is what amazes me the most.  Vrbo (I have no professional relationship or otherwise) regularly get better reviews in online discussion boards comparing the two services.  Their price structure is much more competitive, their review structure is much more robust, in fact aside from Airbnb's more sophisticated visual design, Vrbo leads in many segment of this space.<p>So, to what do I think Airbnb's success comes from?  I think it's Airbnb's marketing / hype / buzz that has been carefully choreographed to maximize their valuation.  And to this, I congratulate Airbnb on their latest success, and to a dance well done.",1306785905

2600272,comment,2599773,2599847,7,0,jello,,,"Also relevant is the follow-up paper published the following year, which extends Dunbar's argument:<p>Dunbar, R. I. M. 1993. Coevolution of neocortical size, group size and language in humans. Behavioral and Brain Sciences 16:681-735.<p>pdf: <a href=""http://www.cogsci.ucsd.edu/~johnson/COGS184/3Dunbar93.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cogsci.ucsd.edu/~johnson/COGS184/3Dunbar93.pdf</a><p>That said, Dunbar's paper - and the entire concept of the ""Dunbar number"" - is the shoddiest piece of science I have ever seen.  Dunbar arrives at the magical 150 by extrapolating from the neocortex ratio to mean group size correlation of nonhuman primates.  However, the human neocortex ratio is 30% higher than that of any primate and the resulting ""corresponding"" mean group size of 147.8 is more than double the highest nonhuman mean group size of 65.5, which makes the validity of such a large extrapolation highly suspect. In an attempt to justify this, Dunbar gives a 95% confidence interval of 100.2 - 231.1 (quite a wide range), then sets out to find as many examples of real-world data as possible that fit in this predetermined interval. As is often the case when one knows exactly what to look for, it appears to be everywhere. My favorite moment is where he encounters Naroll (1956)'s observed maximum settlement size of 500 yet deems it ""likely that the equivalent mean settlement size will not be too far from the value of 150 suggested by the above analyses"" (Dunbar 1993 p687).<p>How are you supposed to go about falsifying an argument like that?<p>Edit: Better formatting.",1306785765

My interpretation is that the technical document describing an API is an original work and that the library implementing an API is an original work (provided they do not copy or modify existing works protected by copyright, then they are derivative works), but the idea the API conveys is not protected by copyright (this is what's known as the idea-expression divide[1]).<p>This is further complicated by the fact that we're discussing the law here so we can't assume anything to be logical or consistent. In the US, the DMCA have specific portions concerning the legality of reverse engineering for various purposes, which have implications for someone wishing to write an independent implementation of an API[2]. Maybe someone would argue that any implementation written according to the API specification is a derivative work?<p>I don't think there's a definitive answer to your question, since AFAIK this haven't been tested in court.

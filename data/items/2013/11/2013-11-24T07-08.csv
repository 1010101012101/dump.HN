On the other hand,given evidence that governments are sabotaging so much of our communications infrastructure, I guess I fear that active MITM will become common quickly unless there&#x27;s some mechanism in place to at least detect, publicize, and investigate it.<p>And since a given IP address can be legitimately used by many different devices, human beings, or organizations in a short timeframe, it&#x27;s hard to see what this would look like.",1385279018

If the perception shifts from &quot;hopeless&quot; to &quot;fighting chance&quot;, and we start seeing more trolls defeated in court, the story can be framed much more usefully. Right now it&#x27;s &quot;businesses are being shaken down for violating frivolous patents&quot;. That&#x27;s not great because it&#x27;s too easy to argue against superficially. All the trolls have to say is &quot;If these patents are so frivolous, why do so many businesses agree to settle out of court?&quot; There&#x27;s a good answer to that question, but now you&#x27;re having a debate, so you&#x27;ve already lost.<p>But if the story is &quot;the courts are clogged with frivolous patent suits because the USPTO isn&#x27;t doing its damned job&quot;, there is no debate.<p>People don&#x27;t like to think. They want someone else to do the thinking for them. If a debate has no tribal affiliation, the two sides both seem to have an argument, and there&#x27;s no authoritative answer, people throw up their hands and say &quot;well, it&#x27;s complicated&quot;. Change the story so that the courts can be that authority, and people will just take their answer as read.<p>So the issue stops being &quot;are patent trolls a problem?&quot; and becomes &quot;how do we fix patent trolling?&quot;",1385278570

6789009,comment,6776753,6787241,2,0,axaxs,,,"I can see where you&#x27;re coming from, truthfully.  I have went through that cycle myself.  Sometime in your late 20s-early 30s you just get too busy with life for things you used to love.  I think the main problem is that, regardless of what anyone thinks, source code is really hard to read.  I mean, line by line, it&#x27;s very simple.  It&#x27;s the logic, the relations, etc. that make it so as I&#x27;m sure you&#x27;ve experienced.  So, in most cases, the maintainer is the only one who truly understands the entire project.   So, when he/she gives up on it, it dies.  But remember, it&#x27;s open source so anyone willing could always take the reigns!<p>Contributing to open source doesn&#x27;t have to be about pouring your heart into it, nor wasting your time.  Bug fixes or improved algorithms are always a good start.  But remember, it&#x27;s open source - you&#x27;re free to fork a project, dead or alive, and make it your own, to monetize it.   The only drawback being that it remains open source, so someone else could just turn and do the same to you.<p>I hope I don&#x27;t come off too much like a zealot.  Open source is important to me because it&#x27;s how I learned, and how I in turn made a good living for myself.  So I feel compelled to give back, to perhaps help others one day as they&#x27;ve done me.  But I do understand it&#x27;s easier for me - someone gainfully employed, than someone not.

That is much less useful, and it had better be extremely clear to users that they should only use it in that way.<p>Depends on how you emphasize that sentence. It&#x27;s reddit, but its anonymity is weaker on certain fronts and stronger on others. If used as one-shot device, it&#x27;s pretty good. Otherwise, there are the issues you mentioned (which I plan to fix, to my best).<p>> So to actually be undetectable as using Aether, you can&#x27;t accept connections. Then you have to hope that enough users are connecting for the anonymity and not the undetectability, or you&#x27;ll have to provide some infrastructure nodes.<p>Correct.<p>> Great, if you promise undetectability, then this should be the default.<p>I do not promise undetectability, but it exists under certain circumstances. I will explicitly note those circumstances and mark undetectability as a side benefit only under those conditions.<p>> I don&#x27;t understand the distinction being made here. In any case, the upvote is observed as coming directly from some IP. That is the identifier to worry about.<p>The distinction is largely academic as you said. If you have a cryptographic solution to that, I&#x27;d love if you could point me to the right direction.<p>> And why can&#x27;t I create a network of Sybils to upvote my spam posts?<p>You can, but users can also block your nodes, or (we&#x27;re really going into the medium-term future here) your nodes would be placed in blocklists, whose users—people who accepted them— would deny you from connecting to them. (This is a half–baked idea as of now, who maintains those lists etc.) This is a thorny problem. Spam filters, I was meaning less of an actual after-the-fact spam filter, and more of a &quot;block this guy out, refuse connections&quot; kind of filter. Sorry for the wrong choice of words.<p>All in all, very fair points I need to work on. If you would be interested in taking a look once in a while to point out where the logic holes are, I&#x27;d really appreciate your voice in development. If you&#x27;d be interested in helping out, send a mail to me (burak@nehbit.net)— I would try to run more important things by you before implementing to see if there are any obvious holes.",1385276653

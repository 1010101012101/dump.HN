In fact that's the reason Flash has largely replaced all the other video plugins like Quicktime and Windows Media Player. They weren't customizable. Flash is.<p>Now, being able to do that customisation natively in Javascript is awesome, but the issue of HTML5 adoption is a much bigger problem and it's even worse now that there are competing codecs.

But courts and legislatures in this country have put limits on contracts. The notion of ""Well, you agreed to the contract, so..."" has been thrown out long ago.<p>There is nothing legally wrong with the Google contract. But if you want to talk about what's right in a moral sense, then it's right that if you unilaterally terminate a contract, and there is financial consideration involved, you should inform the other party about the termination and include a reason for it.<p>There are limits on contract law in this country precisely because both parties in a contract are often on unequal footing. And that's certainly the case here. Consumers are forced to consume contracts as-is that are nearly always one-sided or slanted towards the bigger party.<p>There's no specific relief to this problem as far as I can see. But there's also no need to sit here and advocate it, either, which is what you're doing. Unless, of course, you find yourself personally benefiting from such uneven contract negotiation. In which case, more power to you, and also, you're doing nothing good for humanity.",1244608507

I've seen poor and mediocre programmers  survive as programmers well toward retirement age. Part of the reason is that programming isn't the only skill that they provide. They provide domain knowledge on the systems which the gov (mil and civilian) rely. Then us poor sods have to clean up after them and clean up after them, and hold their hands on radical new ideas like object oriented programming. I could really rant on this topic if I wanted to.<p>Another perspective: I mean, how many coders do you know that make it through a few years working who have <i>NOT</i> developed some significant domain knowledge?",1244608456

Coded in C and C++ for over a decade, and now I'm working in the magical world of Rails, where I get to watch 20-somethings rediscover the value of old ideas the hard way. (Given the average comment thread on Hacker News, and you'd be excused for wondering why <i>anyone</i> ever used compiled languages or static typing.  Silly dinosaurs!)<p>That said, while I appreciate your sentiment, I know in my heart that the author is right.  All of my friends from college have moved out of programming.  Many have left the industry completely -- and we're not even that old!  The bottom line is that there's little or no cost advantage to hiring an older coder, when I have t-shirts that are older than the most popular development environments.<p>Every once in a while, some young geek chimes into these conversations with the observation that one needs only <i>""keep up with technology""</i> to stay relevant in the industry.  But even ignoring the fact that ""keeping up"" is usually easier said than done, the economics just don't work out.  My friends who went to medical school are finishing their residencies and starting in private practice;  my friends who went to law school are making partner.  In most industries, you're just <i>beginning</i> your career when you're in your early 30s.  In software, you're already old enough to be a conversation topic.",1244607460

But, I'd worked with the rest of the senior technical staff before and they knew that just didn't matter.  Sure enough, a couple months later I was submitting patches to the framework.<p>The other thing about new technologies in general, and Rails in particular, is that 2 or 3 years of experience doesn't really mean much because the evolution is so fast.  There's lots of Rails lore out there on the web which is completely out of date, and if you're not willing and able to dive into the code yourself and design your own experiments you're going to make completely incorrect decisions about how to design your app and write your code.",1244607190

I'm not sure exactly how to phrase this:<p>""Of the software-centric industries, what percentage of employees are actually writing software? What percentage of software developers do not work in these industries.""<p>I don't know the answer to that, but for some reason I think it's well under 50%. It tends to (on HN anyway) get presented as the coders & management. But (IMO) that's too simplified to mean much.<p>Programming makes sense as a starting point. It's a relatively straightforward, transferable & acquirable skill set. On the other hand, things like account management, or sales may require the kind of skills you need experience to gain & are hard to develop intentionally.<p>Also, I think it's relatively easy to shift from coding to something else organically, but not the other way around. If you are a programmer that ends up making software for the agricultural industry , you may pick up all sorts of skills & knowledge that make you useful in other areas. If you enter that industry from another end (even if you are very close to the software), you are unlikely to become useful as a programmer. At least not without intending to.<p>You wouldn't be surprised to hear this story: CS degree at 22, worked as a developer of farm management software for 5 years >> a (software/technology) consultant in agribusiness for 5 years >> a manager/executive/account manager/marketing person etc. for irrigation supplies manufacturer >> something else.<p>You would be somewhat surprised to hear the reverse, someone with 10 years industry experience leveraging that to create software for that industry. It's not impossible, but it's worth remarking on. It probably means that either the person was a programming amateur that went pro or that they actively decided to retool themselves via a path of quite a lot of existence.",1244606801

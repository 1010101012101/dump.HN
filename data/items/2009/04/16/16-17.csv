The basic idea is that you partition the data over a set of machines, and similarly divide and parallelize query processing.<p>MR is basically a specialized parallel DB that executes a single query of the form:<p><pre><code>    SELECT map(...), reduce_agg(...)\n    FROM ...\n    GROUP BY map(...)\n</code></pre>\nAgain, MR's architecture differs in various ways from the design of a typical parallel DB, but they are certainly comparable.<p><i>It doesn't make any sense, for example, to talk about loading data into MapReduce</i><p>MR input data is typically stored on a distributed filesystem (e.g. HDFS, GFS). Loading the data onto that filesystem is analogous to loading the data into a parallel DB; in both cases, the input data is partitioned over a set of nodes. For good performance, you want a copy of the data to reside close to where the subsequent computation is going to take place. But certainly MR and DBs differ in this respect: a DB typically assumes it ""owns"" the data, whereas MR is more amenable to processing data stored in an arbitrary external format. This difference is not fundamental, though.<p><i>I strongly doubt relational databases are used for precisely the same (or even somewhat similar) tasks.</i><p>You would be mistaken, then. If you want to do analysis on large volumes of data using a cluster of machines, both parallel DBs and MR are viable choices. The whole point of the paper is to take a set of queries, execute them using both Hadoop and parallel DBs, and compare the resulting performance and user experience.",1239900720

565358,comment,565106,565285,0,0,dskhatri,,,"I agree. The author just picked up a reference design kit. It's a whole different matter to design the circuit itself. Picking the right MOSFETs, gate driver IC, feedback system are crucial to great performance. I'm not an audiophile but I know a great Class D engineer/audiophile who's designed a system with a THD+N of 0.003% (The Zetex amplifier the author chose has a THD+N of just 0.1%). It's cool to hear the engineer talk about the ""color of sound"".<p>[Addendum] THD+N is a measure of the purity of the output i.e how well the amplified audio signal matches the smaller input audio signal that's fed into the amplifier (from a CD player for example). So the lower the number the better. Typically, the amplifier circuit itself adds some distortions and noise to the actual audio signal. For example, if you fed a pure 1V 1kHz sine signal into the amplifier, your output might be a 20V 1kHz sine wave but with additional signals mixed in. These signals will include inherent noise generated by the amplifier and harmonics generated by the switching nature of the Class-D amplifer (if you look at your audio signal at the output of the MOSFET switches and before the low pass filter, it will look like a square wave or more specifically, a PWM).<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Total_harmonic_distortion"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Total_harmonic_distortion</a>",1239898584

He almost deliberately seems to not want to understand the definition of a Universal Computer (by which he must mean a Universal Turing Machine).<p>It would surprise me if his example functions are actually computable.  In his paper on the subject he comes up with a scenario in which a machine needs to compute a function of n variables that vary with time.  He then places the restriction that reading each variable takes one unit of time so that once you've read the first one the value of the second one has changed and so you can't do the computation.<p>Then he goes on to say that if he supposes a computer capable of doing n computations at once he can get round the restriction he's imposed because he's able to read all the variables at the same time.<p>How is this supposed to make me think that Turing was wrong?<p>Having worked on software/hardware interactions quite a bit you actually see this sort of thing happen.  Lots of data comes in on different ports and you need to read it all at the same time.  This is solved by latching the data into a buffer which the CPU can read at its leisure.<p>But the fact remains that the function you are computing is actually computable (he gives the example of summing the data).  He's just produced an artificial restriction on the computer being incapable of reading the data fast enough.  His n-processors is a complicated way of solving what we solve with buffers.<p>And also who said there's a lower bound on the per-instruction speed of a Turing Machine.  Sounds like this guy just needs a faster machine.  After all a Turing Machine is an abstract idea, so let's just redefine it's operating speed by a factor of n and his function becomes computable.",1239898492

Apparently, they've capped bandwidth at something ridiculously low a month, but you can pay another $30/mo to blast that cap up to... 40GB/mo!<p>Oh, and as a show of charity, they capped the max overage charges you can be billed at $75/mo for this special plan which already costs $75/mo. So, basically, you can get unlimited bandwidth for $150/mo. What a steal!",1239898465

However it's not as bad as it might seem, most of the designers I know in the industry run sites or design plenty of other things than can be used in their portfolios, if they ever do decide to switch jobs. I've interviewed hundreds of people and rarely do I ever care about their previous companies, all I want to see is how well they can design, not who they designed for.<p>Granted I also wouldn't want to work for a company that would be biased against a designer who did adult work, so for me personally, it makes sense. If you have hesitations, I would fully recommend passing on working in adult.",1239898437

I'd like to try the problems but am not interested in saving my results. I can't try such and such problems because I need an account simply to validate my answers.<p>I am going to allow unregistered users to solve problems, however, I have to uglify the form with captcha,<p>* I'm not sure if displaying the last 10 on the front page is a good idea... if I come back tomorrow to check this problem I saw there, will I have to go to page 2? ProjectEuler's page has them in increasing order.\nMy thought behind this was if u come tomorrow I don’t want to see the same problems (hopefully solved problems ;-) )<p>* Remove some text. “Average User Rating: easy ” can be transformed into “Easy” in the blue problem header, for example. Make it easy to see and filter. You can use images there as well, or colors. Difficulty: Green → Orange → Red.<p>Great point, will do that.<p>* The list of solvers is unreadable. Why is it in italics? What's its maximum length? You could use something like the “following” list on twitter: lots of small icons (24x24 or so).<p>* Also either display the login or the name, not both.<p>I wanted to display the name, but also didn’t want to force the user (when registering) to go to a painful process, hence, not all the users have names.<p>* Why do you limit top user to 10? It makes sense for problems as they take a lot of space, but you could easily display users hundred by hundred.<p>I wanted to have top 10 ;-),<p>* Are tests made of problems? What if I've already completed the 5 problems a test contains when I start it? Do I automatically win?<p>No, you have to answer them again.<p>* I don't have an account so I can't check, but do you allow LaTeX in the discussions on each problem? Is there an option to add code? Is it allowed? Is it colored when entered?<p>At this chapter there is still more work ahead, currently only some special math characters are supported (like x^(y) – power, x_(1) , ..)<p>* The white space on top is way too large.<p>agree<p>* Is this a website or a “framework”? Revise your wording on the right.<p>English is second language for me, so framework sounded cool, I guess I have to look it up in the dictionary.<p>* In general, try to avoid “database views”. I don't know how to word this better, but don't put “fieldname: fieldvalue” in your texts. For example in the submitter name: “test submitted by $name on: $date”. You don't need a colon here, this is not how you would write it in a letter for example.<p>agree<p>* Put all your tags in lowercase. Fibonacci stands out and Einstein is missing a capital E.<p>agree<p>* Are you displaying ALL the tags? What will happend when you get to a thousand?<p>No, only top 100<p>* Could the problems be put in different math groups? Set theory, algebra, geometry (can a submitter upload images?), trigo, etc. Beware, this could be confusing: should I put this in the “Algebra” category or tag it as algebra?",1239897941

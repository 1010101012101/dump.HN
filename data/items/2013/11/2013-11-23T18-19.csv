Therefore, after some research, I noticed that the market was underserved in this area, mainly because the websites focused in trailers have mainly two problems:<p>- They are &quot;noisy&quot;: they have too many options, too much advertising, too much clutter;\n- They&#x27;re only focused in the &quot;new&quot;: they almost only cover the upcoming movies.<p>So I decided to create a different space, where the users can be aware of the Hollywood upcoming movies, but also resemble movies that they love and bring them great memories or find out movies that are totally unknown to them.<p>Any feedback is appreciated.<p>Thanks.",1385233141

Orwell installed Big Brother and had tight control structures organize society. I.e. people are forced to not misbehave. Huxley, on the other hand, (at least that&#x27;s how it felt to me) found solutions to all the small issues that make people misbehave, and just implemented a society around it. In his dystopian future, people don&#x27;t <i>want</i> to misbehave, they&#x27;re not interested in it. I think both societies have equal chances of survival, but the Huxley society has a higher chance of coming into existence because it installs itself in line with peoples desires, instead of confronting their desires.<p>[1] <a href=\"http://thesleepymoose.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/huxvor-2.png?w=604\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://thesleepymoose.files.wordpress.com/2012/10/huxvor-2.p...</a>",1385232973

They think the tradeoffs in terms of civil liberties and government spending are worthwhile. And I agree, they DO think that!<p>But that does not translate into &quot;the government has a responsibility to try to prevent mass casualty events&quot;. If the people decided that policy for terrorism should be more like policy for cars than policy for threatening foreign powers, then the government should follow suit. There&#x27;s no implicit responsibility to treat some causes of death differently.<p>As I said way up in my original comment, the problem here is the people themselves. We must convince the <i>public</i> to take a more rational approach to terrorism, one in which the effort expended in countering it compared to the potential threat it poses is more in line with the ratio dedicated to other threats.<p>One part where we disagree is where you say that people would &quot;rightfully be pretty agitated&quot; with one Boston bombing a month. Would people be &quot;rightfully agitated&quot; if a similar number of deaths and injuries was happening in Boston every month, but spread out across the entire month? Because I&#x27;m pretty sure that&#x27;s the case, but most people don&#x27;t get agitated, and we tend to think that those who do get agitated at the daily grind of death and mayhem that makes up life are a bit insane.",1385232886

But now a team from the US Geological Survey has identified a body of underground water that is actually a remnant of a past ocean water, a body of Early Cretaceous North Atlantic sea water. Deep drilling at the site of the Chesapeake Bay impact crater has yielded groundwater with an isotope and chemical composition signature that together with model analysis suggests that it was trapped in the sediments before the impact occurred around 35 million years ago. The water may have lain undisturbed for much longer: it has an average salinity of about 70 parts per thousand, twice that of modern sea water, and is probably 100–145 million years old.</i><p><a href=\"http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v503/n7475/full/nature12714.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v503/n7475/full/nature1...</a>",1385229827

If bitcoin does survive, it will eventually settle as some kind of new age gold, but for now it&#x27;s more of a slot machine. Whether bitcoin survives or not depends on how hard governments try to force regulation on it in the short term, I&#x27;d think.

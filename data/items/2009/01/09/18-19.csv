426962,comment,426441,426703,0,0,ardit33,,,"i think android has a much brighter future.  Speaking from some inside knowledge, there are two large carriers that will introduce android devices this year.<p>Plus, all the Asian manufacturers (Samsung, LG, Kyocera, and some smaller Chinese ones ) don't have any good OSs in the plate. So they are already working on android devices.<p>Here is a rundown of the mobile world:<p>iPhone -- we all know it. Developing for it is not easy, and the process is not friendly at all.  Good for games, but very restrictive APIs, and what you can do.  There is so much more this device can do, but Steve Jobs doesn't want you to.  So, some good competition is always welcome, as it will force Apple to open up.<p>Blackberry OS (semi-niche. Popular, but an OS with only one manufacture. Plus J2ME is going to be phased out, the BB Api is not that great (UI wise).<p>..<p>Symbian - Will be open source in a year. It is old, (based on work from Psion two decades ago), and development for it is not great  (plus the UI is horrible).<p>..<p>Winmo - Has been around since 2002. Hasn't chagned much in years. Development for it is ok (not that hard), but overall it is Microsoft yucky interface.  It was good for coorporates that didn't want to pay the Blackberry extra costs, but right now it is way behind.<p>..<p>Android -- The new kid on the block.  Programing for it is easier, (performance is ok, not that great for games), it is open, and it runs on top of Linux, but it can run everything.<p>..<p>Palm --  Used to be hot 5 years ago. And now trying to come back.  I really don't know any companies trying to work on anything on palm.  They need to get a good app dev environment going,  but they are not big enough to create yet another platform to develop for.  Android/Dalvik,  (or maybe Flash), will be great choices.<p>..<p>Linmo -- DOA.  I have seen a couple of Motorola Linmo handsets, and they are crap.  Just give up. The OS doesn't really matter anymore,  the APP Environment is the one that matters now.  Users really don't care if the underpinning of the OS is Linux, OS X/BSD, Symbian, or whatever.  They just care for shiny things (flashy and animation), and running apps.",1231527506

Like a typical app, my site has a landing page which provides an overview of the site and allows you to login or sign-up, a ""learn more"" section with a more detailed write-up of what the site offers as well as FAQ and About Us pages. After that, its just the app. Aside from looking for a good resource for information (webpage, book) my questions are:<p>1. Is the landing page the only one I need to focus on for SEO purposes? (I'm thinking yes, because this is the page that will have all the linkbacks)<p>2. Should I use robots.txt to block the crawler from the URLs that lead directly to the app (which you need to login to use). Should I block anything else, like the images directory?<p>3. Should I try to point people to http://www.mysite.com or www.mysite.com or mysite.com? Should I try to pick the form that most of my linkbacks are in?<p>4. Is a Sitemap necessary for such a simple page structure?<p>btw, I've read this HN tread(http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=119986), however the site that seemed to come off best costs $100/month. Looking to learn and do this myself.<p>Thanks.",1231527257
426957,comment,426611,426791,0,0,scott_s,,,"What you say is ""marketing,"" I think is author creativity. Knowing the authors, the titles <i>sound</i> like their writing. For example, being a power broker is probably the main theme of the book about Robert Moses. The term is used several times, there's a chapter entitled that, and the central theme of the book is how Moses came to respect, acquire and wield power.<p>Similarly for The Coldest Winter, the author (David Halberstam) stresses the cold as a perennial problem for the infantry, and most of the events occur during a particular winter. I've read several of his books, and it's very much in line with his writing style.<p>Same with Shake Hands With the Devil. The author (Romeo Dallaire) uses that phrase in the introduction and at a turning point of the book to express how he felt about his position - he literally shook hands with perpetrators of genocide.<p>I agree that non-fiction books often have a kicker in the title to clarify the subject matter. But I think the pretty, poetical title is usually written by the author. At least I think it is for the books I read.",1231527233

426922,comment,426828,426869,0,0,jm4,,,"Just because they've routed calls over the internet up until now doesn't mean this is the only way to do it. There are probably quite a few reasons for not using the data connection. A couple that come to mind are possible call quality issues and wanting to stay on the good side of carriers. We can gripe all we want about how much the carriers and their policies suck, but can you really blame someone for trying to avoid having to battle one of them?<p>This still covers users who primarily use Skype for international calls and maintains a high level of quality. The data connections on mobile phones can be spotty at times and this way you have a reliable connection to a relay point which in turn uses a more reliable internet connection. I used a VOIP service a while back that worked like this and it was great.<p>For all we know, they tried VOIP calls directly from the handset only to find out it's unreliable. I use StreamFurious on my handset and I'm disconnected every few minutes so this isn't so far fetched. Or maybe their market research revealed that most users are interested in international calls in which case it's an easy decision to go in this direction to avoid trouble with carriers. We really don't know. It's possible there's a good reason for it.<p>In any case, they're not being deceptive about it, and for the most part, the result is pretty much the same despite the varying methods. The only ones who are really left out here are the people who want to buy a handset with a data connection and make most or all of their calls for free over the internet. The reality is that they probably make up a small portion of Skype users. Sure, it would be nice, but when the companies building and controlling the networks are still in the business of selling phone calls this is a pipe dream. Maybe one day they'll just provide access to the network but we're not there yet.<p>I'm not aware of any terms of service that prohibit using the data connection for VOIP calls so someone is always free to create an application that does this. The best part about Android and the G1 is that you can install whatever you want on there whether you have permission from a carrier or not.",1231525791

OCaml is faster than Ruby (about 24x faster which, incidentally, is pretty close to the 22x greater requests served).<p>But as someone who has done a lot of web applications and as many of you I'm sure feel: it doesn't matter how fast your web application runs.  What matters is whether your database layer and the schema you're using scales.<p>I guess the only arena that I really care about performance in is the database/datastore arena.  Plus, Ruby is getting better optimized.  Ruby 1.9 should be a huge leap forward and while it won't beat OCaml, it will be much, much better.

426893,comment,426569,426871,0,0,whacked_new,,,"I forgot to mention something in my last post. It isn't so much the assumption of liquidity, but the assumption that given the particular kind of liquidity, the efficiency (in terms of opportunity cost) can be the same.<p>When I said liquidity of human capital, I did not want to mean person P moves from company X to company Y. I wanted to mean person P's production power (in terms of output, factoring in creativity, and the myriad of other factors), within the system (which also factors in P's capacity to induce disruptive changes) gets transferred seamlessly from X to Y. Again, this does not seem at all possible. Neither does this factor in effects of people spontaneously regrouping (i.e. forming startups). Having people in stable structures inherently slows down regrouping quickly, and you cannot assume that capital (money, enticement, whatever) can induce it to become efficient, simply because transfer of resources takes time and distance.<p>Of course, with the ideal assumptions of perfect information and instantaneous transfer of all resources, this would seem to work, but these are the same assumptions that ground many economic models permanently in theoretical territory.<p>Now, is there still a good reason to think the systems can be the same?",1231524773

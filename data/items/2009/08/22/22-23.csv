Dennis Mueller made the point well when he noted\nthat ""the probability of being run over by a car going to or\nreturning from the polls is similar to the probability of\ncasting the decisive vote. If being run over is worse than\nhaving one’s preferred candidate lose, then this potential\ncost of voting alone would exceed the potential gain""\n(1989, 350).</i>",1250981889

779937,comment,779531,779851,0,0,sho,,,"<i>""Once you become intolerant yourself in opposition, you lose the basis for your argument.""</i><p>Ah, that's the Achilles' heel of liberalism right there, isn't it? Actually, I think we must make an exception for intolerance. The goal is not just to promote tolerance at the level of the single person. It's to maximise it society-wide. With that perspective, intolerance is identifiable as a cancer in the system, and must be excised.<p><i>""taking positions that were far afield of what I wanted""</i><p>Ha. Sounds familiar! There's a fine art to maintaining one's argument, even in the face of <i>in extremis</i> counterargument pushing one further and further away from one's core position. It's an art I have not yet mastered. Elsewhere on this site you'll find plenty of examples of my being suckered into making spirited defences of unsavoury things while trying to defend some much more noble principle. Perhaps the format of this site's discussion is simply unsuitable to making complex arguments with deep roots, especially given the expedited timeframes for making a response anyone is likely to read.<p>A fews years ago I tried starting to write a book which would describe all my beliefs, and why I believed them, derived from as close as I could get to first principles. I abandoned the project when it became an organisational nightmare; trying to justify what I thought in one area turned out to have links to 10 other areas and after a while I didn't know whether I was trying to enumerate and codify my answers to moral questions or writing a blueprint for ""my perfect society"". Anyway it was completely unmanageable and I gave up.<p>I've given some concepts in graph theory and structured data a lot of thought since then and I should probably try again. Most of my beliefs can, I believe, be encoded in a directed acyclic graph. I should attack the problem again not as a book but as a web site, so I can just post a link to the appropriate section here and save a lot of time, while also keeping the discussion formal and free of scope-creep.<p>That would also satisfy your requirement for belief self-scrutiny. What could be more rigorous than explicitly enumerating and justifying - and thus throwing open to public scrutiny - every founding element of every belief you hold?<p>Damn, I really should get started on that ..",1250981817

You also find yourself competing against many, many novelists in a fragmented marketplace, as I described in response to an agent's blog here: <a href=""http://jseliger.com/2009/07/25/literary-fiction-and-the-current-marketplace"" rel=""nofollow"">http://jseliger.com/2009/07/25/literary-fiction-and-the-curr...</a> . Note in particular that you're also competing against a used book marketplace that's got decreasing friction.<p>That's not to say I'm complaining: but it's also how it goes, and people who don't understand the structure of the publishing industry or the forces acting on it might find some very unpleasant surprises as they wade into the riptide. One nice thing about Greenspun's comments about writing is that they're realistic and readily accessible.

Some of us realize we are ignorant and some are so full of themselves they think they know everything.<p>You might notice that countries that ban or curtail religion want the people to depend upon the government (either do what the government says or starve). Any sort of organized Religion is the closest thing to a social safety net that is not government run.  Until recently, even the United States didn't have a social safety net.<p>When I was in my teens and 20's I thought the same way as you.  Then I became less ignorant.

779925,comment,779812,779881,0,0,jseliger,,,"I think that the date of Greenspun's essay is indicative of how little has changed, rather than how much. Most writers didn't make very much money then, and they still don't, which many people don't seem to realize, and they often work like astronauts to achieve relatively modest financial success, which people like the poster in the original HN thread might want to know before getting started in earnest at trying to write for the book market.

If you mean, ""Do I think writers can make enough from the Internet to support themselves?"" the answer is yes; if you mean, ""Will many of them do so, especially relative to the number who would like to?"" the answer is ""no."" In fact, I even wrote a blog post on the subject of how unlikely it is for people to  make money from blogging: <a href=""http://blog.seliger.com/2009/06/17/youre-not-going-to-be-a-pro"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.seliger.com/2009/06/17/youre-not-going-to-be-a-p...</a> .<p>Still, I write this a wannabe novelist who is nonetheless going into things with his eyes open, rather than closed.

But those are just symptoms. The disease is replacing the profession of journalism with clowns like Arrington. The pathology that results is ""publications"" with:<p>* No sourcing policies<p>* No retraction policies<p>* No conflict of interest controls<p>* No separation between editorial and reporting<p>You're better off with a Murdoch paper than with TechCrunch. At least the WSJ does great reporting outside the editorial pages. Here you're disputing whether there's a non-knee-jerk reason to dislike TechCrunch, over a story in which Arrington uses anonymous sources to assert that Apple is acting quasi-unlawfully, in part over behavior that Arrington simply doesn't <i>like</i>. You couldn't get this published in a column in a mainstream paper.",1250978527

I worked through it a few years back and loved it.<p>Word of warning, though - 2600 programming is particularly tricky, because you only have a couple of screen buffers, and each is a byte.  So when changing the background, you have to keep track of where the electron gun is and write things at the right time if you want the left and right side of the screen to be different :)",1285347592

Call and state your case, make it clear it's no-pay right now either way, but you want to fulfill your obligation in the further - say start making payments in 12 months.<p>b) RackSpace - you owe personally or through corporation? If personal, call them and have the same conversation - speak with a manager and ask for payment terms outside of normal, otherwise you have to default. If corporate consider folding and walking away, corporate protection is there for a reason and even though it's not a stand-up thing to do, Rackspace's world is littered with bankrupt startups.<p>c) Visa & MC may be your big problem, getting blacklisted from merchant accounts isn't the end of the world but certainly something to avoid. Also nearly impossible to reach a human that can make decisions on terms. For a startup they should have a 20% merchant reserve on your account anyways, how far does that take you?<p>Bottom line, think 6 - 12 month terms instead of 12 day terms.<p>No reason at all you can't get there with the right amount of sucking it up and pleading your case.",1285347498

1724292,comment,1723258,1724119,0,0,btilly,,,"Note, this was IBM's lawyer talking, not your own.  IBM's interests were represented there, not yours.<p>Lawyers are in the business of convincing people that the law says what they want it to say.  However in the case of a dispute it doesn't matter what IBM's lawyer says, it matters what a judge thinks.  So of course if you ask IBM's lawyers, they'll represent IBM's interests by making the broadest possible claims for what is IBM's.  That doesn't make them right, nor does it mean that they would actually pursue it.  But as long as they leave you convinced, they've accomplished their goal.<p>That said, they are correct that the statute gives them that way to claim your work.  And the larger the company you're in, the broader that claim can become.  And when you listen to their lawyers, the claim will become broader still.  Putting that all together, I wouldn't take their word for <i>anything</i> without consulting your own lawyer who represents your interests.<p>Alternately, if it is important to you, you always have the option of telling your manager that this issue is important to you, and you're willing to leave your job if that is what is needed so you can work on your own project.  In that situation it is amazing what miracles can happen once it is made clear to the lawyers that giving you the freedom you want is actually in IBM's interest.  (Advice from lawyers is very frequently penny wise and pound foolish.  The smarter the business, the more strongly they realize that.)<p>Depending on the current job market at the time, it may be advisable to line up another job option before attempting such drastic action.",1285347056

So you (and pg in one of his essays) conclude that the patent rules should be equivalent.<p>However, the purpose of patents is to promote progress by motivating people to invent.  So what matters is the input to the process, i.e. the human activity that eventually leads to a working machine.<p>The patent system was designed for human activities that involve so much time and effort that people might not do them without an additional incentive, i.e. temporary monopoly.  Picture 18th-century mechanical engineering.  Building several different designs of a machine to see which works best would be a monumental task.  It would be much easier to search the patent database and find something someone else invented, and cheaper to license it from them.<p>Imagine for a moment what would happen if you gave everyone a machine such that you could simply drop a diagram of a mechanical invention into it, and out the other end comes a working implementation.  That would totally change the game.  Invention would require much less effort.  Everyone would be doing it without consulting the patent database, and the huge influx of inventors would overwhelm the patent office, making it impossible to find which inventions in the flood of incoming applications are novel and nonobvious.<p>This is what happened with software.

1724263,comment,1723904,1724117,0,0,akeefer,,,"Patents only cover certain types of creative behavior for which patent protection makes sense as a way to encourage innovation.  For example, it's never been possible to patent the plot of a novel, and up until recently it wasn't possible to patent an abstract business process or method.<p>The argument, then, is that patents on software are A) unnecessary to encourage innovation and B) actively discourage innovation.  The argument for A) is that plenty of software development happened prior to it being patentable, few software developers or startups consider patentability when creating new products, software itself is well covered by trade secret and copyright protection, and the patents themselves contribute basically nothing to the world's store of knowledge about software.  The argument for B) is that most software patent suits are complete BS and are launched either by trolls or in an anti-competitive manner rather than as a result of any sort of actual ""theft,"" any piece of software could potentially infringe on hundreds of patents, patents themselves tend to cover ""inventions"" that anyone else solving a similar problem would come up with, and that patents themselves thus tend to either discourage people from even trying new ventures, out of fear of being sued, or serve to drain resources from companies that actually produce products, tying up resources that could actually be used for innovation.  It's also worth noting that the 17/20 year term of a software patent is completely out of whack with the pace of innovation in software.<p>So you can try to split hairs around saying that some software patents (say those around non-obvious compression schemes) are legitimate, but I'd guess that something close to 99.95% of software patents are trivial/silly/should never have been granted, so in this case I'd argue that's totally worth throwing out that 0.05% of ""good"" patents in order to ensure that we get rid of the other 99.95% of them.  I'd rather see that happen than try to defend that 0.05% and end up keeping even 5% of the current amount of BS patents.",1285346502

A well-trained bayesian system would probably correctly identify 99.9% of these emails. Sure, you might miss .1%, but you're missing 100% now.<p><i>But answering a real customer email with a real person probably costs $5-$20 depending on the kind of company you are.</i><p>And if this is the case, you're also doing it wrong. First of all, probably less than 1% of people are going to respond to these emails, especially things like order and shipping confirmations. Of those that do respond (and assuming you've already filtered out-of-office, bounces, etc), you can probably put the rest into one of three buckets:<p><pre><code>  1. Emails where no response is required\n  2. Emails where a simple canned response is sufficient\n  3. Emails that require some kind of action or lenghty response\n</code></pre>\nI'm willing to bet that the majority of emails would fall into bucket #2. The best way to handle this would be a system where the CS agents can see the email and select a pre-defined response with a single click. This is going to cost you almost nothing. Again, bayesian systems would help with suggested responses. Canned responses aren't ideal, but they're better than nothing, and they come from an actual human being who can deal with further messages if needed.<p>Responses to emails in category #3 are where you're right: it would cost $5 - 20 to handle. However, <i>these are customers who need real customer service</i>. Your proposed alternative is to bounce their messages and leave them frustrated. That's exactly what we're trying to avoid.<p>Finally, even if Facebook does make $2 / customer, losing a customer costs them more than $2.<p>PS - Your point about monopolies and legally-required notifications is a good one, though more as an example of why government-sponsored monopolies and arduous regulations are bad ideas.",1285345233

You get the distinct feeling that you are watching other people enjoying life instead of actually having fun in your own life. In the times I am on FB too much, I know, at some level, that I'm looking to connect more meaningfully with people. But I'm confusing knowing <i>about</i> someone with having a <i>relationship</i> with that person. It's like pornography for the shy. And, just like pornography, it also feels so...empty. There's a certain social code that prohibits you from simply striking up conversation randomly with ""friends"" on a status update. I mean, you can, but it is risky.<p>Facebook is vanity, pure and simple. It is your personal PR machine. Ideas are not valued as they are, they're always filtered by what your ""friends"" think of you. More anonymous sites, such as HN, fare better in this regard. The demographics of the users also have a huge effect. FB will be abuzz with something like football teams winning/losing, but few will put up anything you wouldn't find on a generic, boring web portal, such as MSN. The ""Like"" feature only reinforces this lowest common denominator conformity.<p>I regularly question my use of the site. In subsequent stages of life I can easily see myself not having an account at all. I can only hope their walled garden approach fails somehow, because my generation is not smart enough to wake up from the always-connected narcotic that is web 2.0.",1285344665

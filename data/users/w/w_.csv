The extravagant cascading raw bar, towering with shellfish and lit through glistening ice, sets the tone for the raw bar dining area. A hand-blown glass ""caviar"" chandelier serves as the focal point in the bar area, adding a festive sparkle to the proceedings, and the open kitchen fills the main dining room with a lively  and deliciously aromatic  brasserie ambiance.",1337684862,1452903081

Our goal is to develop a unique platform that will serve as a basis for different projects that help people in various areas of life from the childhood to the old age: education, healthcare, sport, law and etc. We are against growing trends for Internet censorship and information access restriction, so our data bases will contain only uncopyrighted data, and anyone will be able to download and use DB damps created on the basis of a principle that separates the form and the content, i.e. you can easily use them in your own projects. Eventually we plan to decentralize the project and move its mirror to I2P. The project is based on the semantics, one of essential elements of the so called Semantic Web, which is referred to as Web 3.0 by some people.",1354009483,1452908012

Long Live SEO v2. <p>We're global, serving a global list of clients responding to a global marketplace.<p>Most people finally agree that SEO (Search Engine Optimization) is dead. Google has effectively made the concept of blanketing the Internet with repetitious and irrelevant media ineffective and with good reason.<p>Simply put, the purpose of a search engine is to deliver relevant results. In the past, traditional SEO techniques made it possible to 'trick' or 'engineer' those results.<p>So its no surprise that Google, Bing and other search engines will have been actively working on methods to knock back useless content that serves to dilute the Internet. Duplicate or irrelevant content is of little value when you're searching for something.<p>So whats the answer?<p>WireNews+Co has been advising our members against posting their media through multiple websites since 2001. Today, it makes more sense than ever to deliver your message to the right audience.

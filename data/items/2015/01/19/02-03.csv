That is why New York&#x27;s art scene was so hot back when &quot;white flight&quot; was in the news -- when all the whites moved the suburbs, and New York almost defaulted on its debt, then New York was a the world capitol of art. That was an era when New York had low rents.<p>Artists need 2 things that rarely come together: a concentration of cultural capital/amenities plus low rent. A growing city with a thriving industrial base rarely produces a great art scene. It&#x27;s when the crisis hits, and therefore rents are low, that the art scene flourishes. Many of the great &quot;golden ages&quot; of art arose at a time when urban centers were already in decline. Much of what we think of as the Italian Renaissance happened after 1492, when the trade routes suddenly shifted to the Atlantic, and the Italian city-states saw their trade erode. Likewise, the Spanish golden age, in art, occurred after the shipments of gold and silver, from the New World, went into decline.<p>For the last 20 years we&#x27;ve seen cities such as Berlin emerge as great art scenes, and again, they follow the same pattern: the struggle to integrate the old Communist regions into the rest of Germany has proceeded with painful slowness, and Berlin offers a great cultural center with low rents (certainly low compared to New York, though rents in Berlin have been rising quite a lot).<p>The emergence of a thriving software scene in New York certainly puts pressure on the art scene in New York. It&#x27;s possible that the center of art in the USA will find a new home. There are many cities in the USA that are still facing economic crisis and therefore offer low rents. New Orleans, Asheville and many other regional centers have incipient art scenes and low rents. Maybe one of them will evolve toward being the arts center in the USA? But of course, we live in a globalized world, so it is possible that a place like Berlin could emerge as the favored location for USA artists.",1421634814

People who snooze like this (I used to) are probably going around with a significant &quot;sleep debt&quot;. For example, if I set no alarm a couple of months ago, I would sleep for 12 hours. If I set no alarm again the next night, I would sleep for 12 hours again.<p>After maybe a couple of weeks of heavy sleeping (see note), your pattern will hopefully return to where you can go to bed at a normal time again without worrying about oversleeping.<p>NOTE: I don&#x27;t recommend trying to make up that sleep night after night. Two nights of 12 hours in a row leave me feeling not my best. But consistently getting above-average amounts of sleep for an extended period of time will move you in that direction.

Yet I can&#x27;t sustain early morning exercise and other things like that after staying up til 1-2am every night. Going to sleep shortly after dinner and waking up around midnight for a few hours reading / coding / learning has really helped me get my shit together.<p>In fact, come to think of it, biphasic sleep was what got me into early morning running. One morning I woke a bit late and worked a bit too long, so instead of only getting a couple more hours I decided to ride it out and go for a run at 5am. Probably a huge turning point in my life and I didn&#x27;t really think much of it.<p>I think this was the thing that really got me interested to try it:\n<a href=""http://web.archive.org/web/20110629110723/http://www.historycooperative.org/journals/ahr/106.2/ah000343.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://web.archive.org/web/20110629110723/http://www.history...</a>",1421633169

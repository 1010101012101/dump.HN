3315896,comment,3311496,3312121,1,0,ZoliErdos,,,"@teyc, I publish / edit CloudAve, and as such, let me clarify a few points.<p>- We're definitely not racist, don't have an anti-Indian angle . In fact my fellow Editor, @Krishnan is Indian. And for all I care he could be an Indian-African-Martian mix, he is there for what he knows, not where he comes from.<p>- Ben is a syndicated contributor, and as such he expresses his opinion, which we may or may not agree with. As Editor, I select which of his - and other authors' - posts we publish, and I try to filter out bias - probably not 100% successfully.<p>- CloudAve can't control what guest authors say on Twitter. All we can do, and again, try really hard is make sure what gets published on our site is unbiased, and hopefully valuable information.<p>- Personally I find his attack Tweet and the lack of disclosure of his past involvement with ZenDesk unfortunate. I even tried to make light fun of it, saying Freshdesk is actually a rip-off of FreshBooks, which in turn is a rip-off of Fresh Choice. Apparently some did not get the irony, taking my tweet literally, even though Fresh Choice is a restaurant chain. Go figure ...<p>- In the grand scheme of things this tweet was a mistake, yet Ben continues to write (mostly) insightful posts, of which we get to cherry-pick and so far our readers seem to like it.<p>- Kudos to FreshDesk for turning this into a PR coup - I suppose this incident brought them more visibility than they would have gained in months without it. Furthermore, now Ben will feel compelled to actually review their product:-)",1323111518

3315769,comment,3303796,3312800,2,0,tszyn,,,"First of all, thanks for sticking to the point and keeping this discussion civil. Would be nice to have a little debate over a couple beers.<p>""copyright is an artificial restriction that doesn't do what it's supposed to, which is to encourage artistic works""<p>I'm not sure copyright doesn't encourage artistic works, but I would actually dispute that this is the only goal of copyright. I would say that the goal of copyright is for a creator of reproducible works to be rewarded proportionally to the value they contributed to society.<p>Consider this thought experiment: Suppose we had absolute proof that doctors would still heal people exactly as much as they do now if we stopped paying them. They would live in poverty, but they would practice medicine out of their passion for the field, desire to do good, whatever. Would it then be right to institute a system of ""free medicine""?<p>I am inclined to think it wouldn't be right. Contributions should be rewarded, even (or perhaps especially?) if the contributor is not doing it because of the reward.<p>re IP: I think you support more restrictions than just correct attribution. Can I take someone's song and perform it for money without paying them, provided I credit them? Can I burn the song on CDs and sell them in a store without paying them? Can I record a concert in HD and sell streaming access to it? Can I take Microsoft Windows, crack the copy protection, and legally sell the cracked software in an online store? If not, can I distribute it freely on a website on which I sell advertising?<p>Notice also that a policy of free copying would introduce an arbitrary distinction. If you host a word processor on your server (""software as a service"") and sell access to it, you can make money. If you sell a word processor that runs on your customer's computer, you cannot make money, because then customers will be able to legally copy the software among each other. This is arbitrary -- in both cases the value provided to society is the same, it's just that in the first case, you obscure your code from your customers to prevent copying.<p>Apart from the arbitrariness and, well, unfairness of this system, it would encourage centralized software provision and draconian DRM schemes (for example, people would write desktop apps in which crucial parts of the code run on some central server, so that the customer's computer never ""sees"" the code). This is bad for the customer -- you have to be online to use the app, it eliminates privacy, it encourages obscurity which is bad for security, etc. We'd be telling software developers: ""You can make money only if nobody ever gets their hands on your code. So you'd better hide it really well"".<p>I realize we already have some bad DRM schemes (esp. in games), but it would be worse if copying was legal. Right now copyright restrictions stop many people from using pirated software. Not so much individuals, but think about businesses. The only way for Microsoft, Adobe, etc. to make money would be to run large parts of Windows/Office/Photoshop on some central server. That wouldn't be good.<p>Of course software makers would still be better off than songwriters and authors -- they cannot hide their work from the world.<p>""if you don't think anyone changes their minds from online discussion, why are you engaging in this one""<p>I'm not sure. Two answers come to mind:\n1. I can't stop myself when someone who appears smart writes things I consider to be false on a subject I consider important.\n2. I believe (as I've previously suggested and you have confirmed) that sometimes people change their mind after the discussion is over, even if they won't budge during the actual discussion.",1323109992

And at times, we'd work for a while together wearing headsets and sharing network resources.  I found that every bit as good as physically sitting next to them.  Actually, it was less distracting, not having someone physically a foot away from you, staring at your screen.<p>Make sure your voice communication is uncapped, and feel free to use it.  (I'm not one for web cams; most of the time, there's no real point to having an image of the other duffer sitting at their keyboard.)  And focus on those people you enjoy talking with.  Take time to get to know their personality; you'll end up sharing the same humor and small asides that you would in-person.<p>(One fellow I got along well with and worked with frequently, I never -- over the course of a few years -- ended up meeting in person.

Don't let physical separation be an excuse for not following through.  This is more important than physical presence.  And, if you are using physical presence to, um, ""influence"" (coerce?) people into getting things done, you already have a problem that is not really a matter of physical presence (or lack thereof).<p>The real world isn't perfect in this regard, but over time, you can emphasize the people you can trust and de-emphasize those you can't.

Both sides are arguable for certain subjects (I can't remember the last time I really used trigonometry, but I do think that learning it helped me to reason better in other domains). However, I find it troubling that statistics is not mandatory/highly encouraged, yet it is something that applies to an incredible amount of everyday activities.",1323108528

My wife and I are amazed at how bad the math education is. Our observations, based on a few kid-years of school across both a public and a private school:<p>- In an attempt to make math easier to learn, they're teaching math really abstractly. ""skip counting"" and a bunch of other stuff. It's basically all the tricks you figure out after you understand what you're doing, but they're teaching the tricks and not the math itself.\n- Further to the last one, they don't teach things like times tables. Rather than just getting kids to memorize the times tables, they make them go through all these hoops to get them further along. I realize that times tables are no fun, but neither is struggling through every problem.\n- Most teachers are not good at math. One teacher would send problems that didn't make any sense. I sat through a presentation by the teachers on the ""new math"" and it was clear they really don't know what they're doing, they're just teaching an algorithm.\n- Most teachers don't like math. How do you instill a sense of love for something that you hate?<p>Many of these things go for other subjects too. It's just that it's more obvious in math.",1323108370

My main concern would be how to back up that private key.  As a technically savvy user, I shouldn't have a problem with that, but I'm not sure how a novice could manage while still keeping everything ""Dead Simple"".  (I suppose a ""backup to cloud"" option could be arranged somehow.)<p>Another problem in my particular case is that I have my browser set to clear <i>all</i> cookies upon exit.  I'd obviously have to change that, because otherwise I'd lose my private key every time I closed the browser.  But that isn't the concern of DSWI I know.<p>I also checked out BrowserID briefly, but as I understand it that requires all logins to go through a central server.  Consequently they need to have a ""privacy policy"" which ""promises"" not to track your online behavior.  That is not true with a system like DSWI, which avoids any central repository or authentication server.",1323108316

The crux of Lockhart's argument is that math is actually really beautiful, intriguing, and exciting, and the legalistic, browbeating manner in which it is currently taught basically takes all the beauty and excitement out of it.<p>Assuming your high school was like mine, when you learned algebra, trig, and calculus, you were probably taught a few of the <i>whats</i>, some of the <i>hows</i>, but almost none of the <i>whys</i>. It's only in upper-level undergrad and graduate courses that the beauty really starts to be taught in earnest.<p>You're absolutely right to say that putting kids through years of proofs would probably make them hate math even more. Again, that's largely due to the way proofs are taught, especially at the secondary school level. They're all just a bunch of <i>rules</i> listed one after another, ""doing a proof"" is basically like explaining all the <i>rules</i> of chess to someone who's never played before, and then asking them to put the board in a particular state, thirty-two moves into a game. It ends up as a bunch of trial-and-error guessing... it's frustrating and it's boring. Sure, there are a few savants or folks whose brains are wired in such a way that it's either easy or interesting, but it's just painful for most folks, because there's no <i>intrigue</i>.<p>It's not until three or four years into college that most people are exposed to proofs as an intellectually stimulating game, where intuition plays an even bigger role than ""looking at a list of rules and deciding which one fits"".<p>But we don't get that in high school. We're not taught how to intuit something and <i>then</i> map the rules to our intuition. In fact, we're usually taught that this is <i>wrong</i>!",1323108001

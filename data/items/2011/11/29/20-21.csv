3292143,comment,3291909,3292117,90,0,freehunter,,,"My family had a major falling out with my father, to the point where myself and my sister had a restraining order against him when I was 7 and she was 9. I haven't seen him or talked to him in 16 years. After Facebook deleted my privacy settings, I had a message from him sitting in my inbox the next day. My sister called me, crying, because she had gotten the same message. Both of our accounts were previously unsearchable on the site, with all of our data being private. As soon as they rescinded that privacy, our father could tell what cities we live in (in one of our cases, a _very_ small town) and that she had gotten married, we both had changed our first and last names, and one of us had a child. He found me through my mom's friends list, he found my sister through my friends list. All of which were previously hidden.<p>Nothing came of it besides an unwanted ""please call me"" message from him, but it's not a far reach from there to actually being located physically and confronted. We sent this man to jail and changed our names to keep away from him, and Facebook, in spite of their ""privacy"" settings, let him get a glimpse back into our lives.",1322600360

3292125,comment,3288437,3288753,3,0,ChuckMcM,,,"Seems like a harsh characterization. When I read articles like this from a person who is enthusiastic and smart but not widely experienced yet, I read it in the frame of mind that this is what the author wishes were true, rather than as something that actually is true. In this case Andrew, who is a student and has been interning at Google apparently, would really like the world to leave the ""x86"" behind and move on to something presumably more akin to what ever he happens to think should be a worthy successor.<p>That being said, in terms of CPU's being shipped that are 'customer facing' and programmable with applications from multiple third parties, ARM chips in 'smart' phones and tablets are taking up a bigger chunk of the pie than any previous instruction set architecture (ISA). That includes both PowerPC (Apple products) and Motorola's 68K architecture (Sun and Apple products).<p>However, what the Andrew misses out on completely is the distinction between systems and processors and the effect that has on adoption rate. This 'secret weapon' that guards the x86 ISA from death like the charm on Harry Potter's head, was put there by IBM in 1981.<p>In 1981 IBM shipped its first ""Personal Computer"" and because it was new to IBM to do that and they expected mostly hobbiests to buy them, the 'hardware information' manual came with schematics, a BIOS listing, and where all the various chips were addressed and how those chips would work. Then as its popularity soared, it was 'cloned' (and this is very important), right down to the register level and with identical BIOS code. The parts were available from non-IBM sources and there was really nothing preventing an engineer from doing it except the off chance that IBM would sue them for something.<p>As it turned out they did sue for copyright violation on the BIOS code but that was really all they could do, the schematic could be copyrighted but implementations of the schematic were not. Once someone had implemented a BIOS in a 'clean room' and that the BIOS was legitimate was sucessfully litigated, the door was opened and the 'PC' business was born. The key here however was that every single one of them was register and peripheral compatible.<p>Another event happened at this time which helped seal the charm. Microsoft started selling MS-DOS which was software compatible (which is to say had the same APIs) as PC-DOS but could run on hardware that was <i>not</i> register compatible. Intel made a high integration chip, the 80186, which you could think of as a ancestor of today's system-on-a-chip (SOC) ARM chips. It ran MS-DOS but because the registers and peripherals were slightly different (better engineering wise, but different) programs that ran on PCs would <i>not</i> run on it if they talked to say the interrupt controller or the keyboard processor. Thus the term 'well behaved' programs was born, and they were few and far between. And the other side was Microsoft Flight Simulator that, in order to get any sort of performance at all, talked almsot exclusively to the bare metal, became the barometer of 'clone' ness. The question ""Can it run Flight Simulator?"" was a buyer discriminator and if the answer was 'no' then sales were disappointing.<p>Those two events, cemented for <i>almost two decades</i> the definition of what it meant to be a 'PC'.<p>Into those decades billions of person-hours were invested in software and tools and programs and features. A meeting of Microsoft and Intel regularly got together with OEMs and chip makers and system builders to define all of the details, the same details that were originally from the PC Hardware Manual, that everyone would agree on constituted a ""PC"". These became known as the ""PC-98"" standard (for PC's built after 1998) or the ""PC-2000"" standard. Things like power supplies, keyboards, board form factors and slot configurations all became sub processes within that ecosystem and followed the lead of this over-arching standard. Obscure stuff like what the thread pitch would be on the screws that sealed the cabinet, not so obscure stuff like the dimensions of the 'cut out' for built in peripheral ports. And during all that time the basic registers, the boot sequence, what BIOS provided, and the set of things that could be counted on to exist so that you could boot to a point to discover the new stuff all remained constant.<p>ARM doesn't have any of that. ARM, as an ISA, is controlled by a company that doesn't build chips, doesn't sell systems using those chips, and is not affected by 'stupid' choices in their architecture. All of that is offloaded to the 'ARM licensees.' And since anyone can license and ARM chip, they do. And that means you have ARM chips in FPGAs and ARM chips from embedded processor manufacturers, and ARM chips from video graphics companies. They are all different. Worse, they all <i>boot</i> differently, they all have different capabilities, they don't talk to a standard graphics configuration, they don't have a standard I/O configuration, they don't have a place where USB ports are expected to appear, or a standard way of asking 'what device is booting me and can I ask it for data?' Quite simply there is no standard ARM <i>system</i>.<p>And because they don't have a standard system, there isn't any leverage. Its like running a race with lead shoes, possible but very tiring.<p>Now some folks, and Andrew here is clearly one of them, think the system problem is solved by 'Android.' They believe that because software developers can write to Android APIs and have their code run on all Android machines, that they are done. Except that getting <i>Android</i> to run on an ARM system is painful. And worse the 'high volume' Android systems have features at different places (where the accellerometer is, how the graphics work, can it do 2D accelleration or not?) There is not Android 'pc' which gets to define all the detail bits and thus free manufacturers from the grip of having to hire expensive software types to figure this out.<p>In the end I agree with Stephen's comment that <i>""If someone could explain how Intel will fail to meet the challenges of getting x86's performance-per-watt to match ARM's....""</i> is a red herring, since Intel has literally years of runway to do that, meanwhile ARM platforms are dying (Playbook anyone?) because the cost to make them pushes them out beyond what the market will bear (and yes the iPad/iPhone are keeping a lid on what you can charge for one of these things)).",1322600035

Instead find the best negotator you can and spar with them until you get over the anxiety. Find something arbitrary to negotiate over like who's buying lunch (I'll buy drinks if you buy appetizer etc...). Once you've got the basics go to a car dealership and haggle with the sales guys. See what works to get you the lowest price. They are skilled negotiators and will talk to you for free. Alternatively, go on a few job interviews where you have no intention of accepting the position. Since you have nothing to lose, push salary negotiations HARD. See what it will take to have someone actually rescind an offer. Finally <i>ask for a raise at your current job</i>.<p>Don't worry, even the big toughguy negotiators had to learn the process and were afraid of it at some point too. I've negotated 50% increases at three different employers (two during intial hire, one as a raise) and it didn't come to me naturally. There was no magic testosterone gift that made it easy. The guy across the table is just as worried as you are.<p>re: socialization factors\nI blame the school enviroment where grading is fair and you ostensibly get the grade you deserve. This normalizes the behavior of 'just do good work, and you get the pay/grade you deserve.' Kids that wheedle the teachers for an A- when they deserve a B are reprimanded.

There's a correlation between physical activity and mental acuity, and, as you mention, you can take out some of your stress out on productive labor (if I do that, I have to buy a new mouse). You also have a balance between the physical and mental side - I'm not sure if there's a corresponding mental equivalent to muscle memory.<p>Second, you can 'outsource' some of the modeling to the actual physical object - the work you're doing has a tangible component, so you don't have to keep the entire thing in your head. That part, to me, is the most draining aspect of coding - I've gotten much better at structuring my code so I can compartmentalize most of that away, but when I'm working with older code or other people's code, I've basically got to have a very accurate representation of the entire program in mind the whole time. That gets really tiring really fast.<p>I think one of the other big differences, though, is that I can screw up an awful lot more than you can and get away with it - if I completely arse up a section of code, I can go back in and redo it at basically zero cost. If you arse up a floor, well, now we need to buy the raw materials for a new floor. The corollary between experts and amateurs mostly holds between construction and coding - give an idiot enough time and eventually you can have either a house or a program - the difference is he'll cost you an awful lot more trying to build the house. That breeds a level of patience and caution which, frankly, is probably better for one's outlook on life in general.<p>Anyway, again, sorry if I seemed to demean physical labor - I really didn't intend to. Like I said, I've seen enough experts in action to know the difference isn't in the hands.",1322597927

In an actor model, state is encapsulated in an actor (identity) and can only be affected/seen via the passing of messages (values). In an asynchronous system like Erlang's, reading some aspect of an actor's state requires sending a request message, waiting for a response, and the actor sending a response. It is important to understand that the actor model was designed to address the problems of distributed programs. And the problems of distributed programs are much harder - there are multiple worlds (address spaces), direct observation is not possible, interaction occurs over possibly unreliable channels, etc. The actor model supports transparent distribution. If you write all of your code this way, you are not bound to the actual location of the other actors, allowing a system to be spread over multiple processes/machines without changing the code.<p>I chose not to use the Erlang-style actor model for same-process state management in Clojure for several reasons:<p>* It is a much more complex programming model, requiring 2-message conversations for the simplest data reads, and forcing the use of blocking message receives, which introduce the potential for deadlock. Programming for the failure modes of distribution means utilizing timeouts etc. It causes a bifurcation of the program protocols, some of which are represented by functions and others by the values of messages.<p>* It doesn't let you fully leverage the efficiencies of being in the same process. It is quite possible to efficiently directly share a large immutable data structure between threads, but the actor model forces intervening conversations and, potentially, copying. Reads and writes get serialized and block each other, etc.<p>* It reduces your flexibility in modeling - this is a world in which everyone sits in a windowless room and communicates only by mail. Programs are decomposed as piles of blocking switch statements. You can only handle messages you anticipated receiving. Coordinating activities involving multiple actors is very difficult. You can't observe anything without its cooperation/coordination - making ad-hoc reporting or analysis impossible, instead forcing every actor to participate in each protocol.<p>* It is often the case that taking something that works well locally and transparently distributing it doesn't work out - the conversation granularity is too chatty or the message payloads are too large or the failure modes change the optimal work partitioning, i.e. transparent distribution isn't transparent and the code has to change anyway.<p>Clojure may eventually support the actor model for distributed programming, paying the price only when distribution is required, but I think it is quite cumbersome for same-process programming. YMMV of course.""",1322597539

On the one hand they suggest people switch to a more expensive product that doesn't have any updates (and this is supposed to be a feature.) On the other hand, they falsely claim that a firewall will stop any attacks.<p>It will be interesting to see if malware authors start finding ways to hack firmware (aside from the obvious ways this could be used in a targeted attack.) DD-WRT/OpenWRT capable routers are of course a better target in general, since coming up with standard payloads that can attack a variety of routers has some pretty good proof of concept code. There's also an obvious set of things you can do with a compromised router (create unsecured wireless, sniff traffic, log passwords.) I'm not entirely sure what one might do with a compromised printer that wouldn't be obvious.",1322597528

Judging from comments online, many people are recommending Linux Mint to family members where they would have once recommended Ubuntu. There's no real evidence of this happening yet (distrowatch isn't a definitive source), but I think Canonical is playing a dangerous game in how it is interacting with it's community on unity and the issues around it.

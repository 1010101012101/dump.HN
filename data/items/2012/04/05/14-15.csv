(Also, I should note that I left a software industry job to do the PhD so I knew I shouldn't have difficulty finding a job.)<p>For anyone who wants to take the leap but is afraid or unsure, I offer some words that were incredibly helpful for me from some of fantastic friends. To quote my amazing advisor from his response to my ""I'm leaving"" email:<p>'We had a Head of Department at Lancaster who used to stomp around the corridors moaning - ""I've just lost another student to industry. He's got a great job, has a starting salary bigger than mine, is working on a fabulous project with better resources than we have. In what mad world is this judged as a failure?""'<p>And another colleague, who's currently a junior professor:\n'You know, most Ph.D.ers are smart and successful people. Hence they have a difficulty in saying This is not for me. They instead say Ive been successful all my life, and I finished everything I started, so I should finish this as well. By saying that, they choose to hang in there for many years in a depressed state.<p>Sometimes, the most courageous thing and the best thing to do is to quit when you know you would rather work in another capacity, or when you know you dont want to work in academia. I congratulate you on your decision and I hope the best for you. ( In case you later decide to come back to academia, it will be waiting for you, so I would not worry about it.)'<p>Best of luck, those of you that are struggling with the decision.

When I sold my part of a startup in Sweden, I got half of it taxed at 30%, and the rest taxed as salary, which is very highly taxed here. Not as nice surprise. Later on I started a new company and put in some of the fully taxed money into that company. When paying employees salaries then the same money was taxed as salary again. No deductions anywhere to be seen.<p>If I would have gotten more money from my exist (I didn't get millions either) the procedure would have been to keep the money within a holding company. Then the taxation wouldn't have been multiple income taxes. But for a small player that really isn't an option, resulting in a truly horrible and counterproductive system.",1333637826

I do not believe that Canadians are unable to produce as high a quality guitar as US Americans, but they are, I believe, not allowed to.<p>The difference in cost between an American Les Paul and its equivalent US model is approximately $250-300.  The difference in quality is less.  The smart money, among most guitarists, is to buy the non-US version, take it to a decent luthier, and give them $75-100 to bring it up to par which, in my experience, actually leaves you with a better guitar than the Memphis version (excluding the much more expensive customs.)<p>Regardless, many consider the US version to be the best of the bunch, and are generally happy to pay the premium.<p>The major difference of course is in the fit and finish.  You have to enforce a quality difference that is, effectively, arbitrary.  In Apple's case, that means deliberately reducing a lesser-quality product for the non-US products, which seems contrary to their 'ship perfection' mentality.<p>It might work, it might not, but the key is in distinguishing between the product versions in some way.  Perhaps this could be accomplished with a slightly different feature set, or maybe the 'white' iphone could be reserved for US manufacture, I dunno, but I honestly have a hard time imagining that there is a significant population of consumers willing to pay for the ""Made in the USA"" version, if only because the ""Made in the USA"" version of other products have not performed up to expectations.",1333637794

There were thousands of graphologists who would analyze a handwriting sample to determine the applicant's character.  It's all complete foolishness, but most employers in France still use it.",1333636261

Especially as the $1M figure here includes your home, which isn't something you can extract an income stream from without grave risk.<p>(Back of envelope: Suppose you reckon you can safely spend 5% of your initial retirement fund per year, without running out before you die. And suppose you want $50k for medical emergencies, because you're in the USA and aren't sure Medicare will (1) still exist and (2) cover everything. And suppose you want $30k/year of effective income after retirement, which doesn't seem insane. Then you need $650k in that fund. Note that that 5%/year figure depends on the overall growth of the economy and how long you expect to live after retirement.)<p>Yes, saving a lot of money can just be pointless avarice.

Point one: The video is nonsense, Point two: Will Glass be successful?<p>Video: I agree that it should have been anchored to current reality, like the Google Plus and self-driving car videos were. But I don't think the video itself was a bad play. RIM/Blackberry released a <i>future-world</i> video back in October (seems to be unavailable now) that had many far away ideas. Gruber criticized it, of course, but I feel like he was right  because in RIM's budget there was no allocation for these imaginary products. Google is actually creating these devices.<p>Glass: As for the <i>hokeyness</i> of having an extra band over your face  technology tends to bend to the habits of our lifestyle. This is what makes being an inventor/entrepreneur frustrating  watching others create applications or devices that people just won't rewrite their whole way of life to use. Seeing people passionately build devices you know have no chance  because they ask the user to change their habits  is cringe inducing. So I get why people might get a bit of that feeling from this device, because I feel it too. On the other hand, humans love incentives and if this device ramps up productivity by doing many of the operations shown in the video (albeit, less fluid) it might be a sell. If you can get people to wear a Bluetooth device in their ear all day, this might be a slight extension of that.",1333635807

I'm running on the assumption that while speed may not be your overriding priority, you will want this to run with <i>some</i> speed. I haven't examined the opcodes, but in this case even if I had to distinguish between a number and a register reference I'd probably do something like let numbers be numbers and let register references be one-element tuples containing the register offset, then switch on the type when it came time to try to use them. That is most likely going to be significantly faster than going through the very powerful class/instance machinery on Python, and should you be inclined to play with PyPy it'll probably JIT a heck of a lot better too. (Although I'd also play with having a number with a very high bit set to indicate that it's a register reference, which would probably JIT even better, since there'd be no type check.)<p>By splitting the difference and playing with PyPy you should be able to use Python to dodge out on a lot of the C bookkeeping BS while potentially not paying very much on the speed penalty.

There are several things that a website owner can benefit from using article marketing as a way of promoting their website. Some of the benefits include traffic generation, link building, website awareness etc. Some of the things to consider critically when promoting your website through article marketing include -:\nTarget Keywords\nArticles that are written for the purpose of article marketing must be optimized for specific keywords that are related to such websites. This makes the articles to appear easily in search queries relating to such keywords. The keywords must be related to the website in order to provide the desired results. It is often advised that new websites that want to rank well in a niche or for a keyword that is competitive should target keywords that are long tailed phrases maybe three to four word phrases.<p>Good Quality Content Articles\nAnother critical factor is that articles must have good quality content before they can be approved for publishing. Articles that are poorly written with grammatical errors and inadequate word count may not be approved. Articles that are rich in good quality content not only get approved for publishing; such articles normally attract good traffic to the owners website. People are hungry for good information, hence when they see an article with good information they are always likely to click on the web link provided.<p>Article Directories Rules\nAlmost all of the article directories currently available on the internet presently have some rules, terms and conditions that people must fulfil before they are allowed to submit articles to such directories. Some of the rules are usually editorial guidelines but sometimes there are a number of other rules beside editorial guidelines that must be fulfilled.

3802606,story,,,1,0,blackzone,"How to promote your website with articles and Links.",,"How to promote your website with articles and Links.<p>Article marketing basically involves writing articles about a particular topic or niche area of your website and submitting them to article directories on the internet with links back to your website in order to create awareness, information and knowledge about the topic, product or service. There are several things that a website owner can benefit from using article marketing as a way of promoting their website. Some of the benefits include traffic generation, link building, website awareness etc. Some of the things to consider critically when promoting your website through article marketing include -:\nTarget Keywords\nArticles that are written for the purpose of article marketing must be optimized for specific keywords that are related to such websites. This makes the articles to appear easily in search queries relating to such keywords. The keywords must be related to the website in order to provide the desired results. It is often advised that new websites that want to rank well in a niche or for a keyword that is competitive should target keywords that are long tailed phrases maybe three to four word phrases.<p>Good Quality Content Articles\nAnother critical factor is that articles must have good quality content before they can be approved for publishing. Articles that are poorly written with grammatical errors and inadequate word count may not be approved. Articles that are rich in good quality content not only get approved for publishing; such articles normally attract good traffic to the owners website. People are hungry for good information, hence when they see an article with good information they are always likely to click on the web link provided.<p>Article Directories Rules\nAlmost all of the article directories currently available on the internet presently have some rules, terms and conditions that people must fulfil before they are allowed to submit articles to such directories. Some of the rules are usually editorial guidelines but sometimes there are a number of other rules beside editorial guidelines that must be fulfilled. Most of the directories usually demand that your articles should not contain more than two self seeking links (i.e. links to your own website or affiliate links), and some do not accept affiliate or any other kind of money generating links in articles submitted to them. The articles must be original and of a particular length in words. There several of such rules, ensure you read the terms of service for such directories before you start submitting articles.<p>A good directory to start submitting your Articles is http://rids.us\nYou can also submit your links at their Link Directory http://rids.us/link-directory/",1333635176

3802592,comment,3801631,3801821,17,0,roc,,,"> <i>""What is wrong with getting the conversation started?""</i><p>A conversation is not a product. Conversations aren't tied to practical concerns or engineering constraints.  Conversations result in interfaces like the one in the demo: there isn't even recognizable <i>input</i> triggering most of the actions.<p>I mean, do we really think Google will be able to pull off a context-aware ""hmmm"" as a vocal trigger signifying desired interaction with a pop-up alert?<p>Microsoft has more processing power available to the Kinect and I can't even hold a conversation in the same room as a Kinect-aware game without accidentally triggering commands. [1]  Becoming notably more accurate would require far more  local processing, or shipping vocal commands off to the cloud for processing,introducing a lag that's wholly unacceptable for UI navigation. [2]  Particularly for UI navigation in a product that's usefulness is predicted on it being quicker and easier than just pulling out your smartphone.<p>And if you don't know how people <i>interact</i> with the product, how can you usefully investigate what they can or will want to <i>do</i> with it?<p>If it turns out that the only dependable ways to interact with such devices involve socially dubious practices [3], they may only find popular use passively displaying various augmented reality data layers over identifiable objects.<p>That truly may be enough.  But the result will look <i>nothing</i> like that concept video and no-one will have profited from Google having produced that video.<p>Don't get me wrong: fiction and futurist musing is great.  But it <i>matters</i> who's having the conversation.  When a corporation speaks about a product or technology, expectations are inevitably set.  And Google's first pass at Glasses is <i>bound</i> to fail the concept video.  Successful heads-up devices are <i>bound</i> to be nothing like that video. [4]<p>But instead of weighing the product on its merits and driving the product in the directions that work, people are going to be discussing the ways in which it fell short of the video and quite possibly trying to force those interactions onto the product, even where they're not working.<p>Consider Microsoft's Tablet excursion. (If nothing else, Google's Glasses project strikes me as a direct parallel to that.)  Microsoft tried to force a full version of Windows onto the Tablet, despite it being unsuited to the form factor, despite the interaction method being wrong, despite the technical strain it put on the already-limited resources available to a mobile device.   And they tried to force that to work for <i>a decade</i> -- long after it was obviously <i>not</i> going to work -- because they'd built up expectations based on a flawed conversation at the outset. [5] Expectations from management, developers, users and even shareholders had been set and the result was ten years spinning their wheels.<p>[1] Mass Effect 3 sure <i>thought</i> I asked it to throw a grenade, even though the conversation I was having didn't even <i>include</i> the word grenade.  I can only imagine how annoying always-on voice control would make a head's up device <i>in public</i>.<p>[2]  Local processing that seems increasingly unlikely for mobile projects, given that everything is shipping voice commands off to the cloud these days.  And Apple's Siri is only borderline-tolerable for higher-level requests; it would be a bag of fail if it were asked to process 'open email' sorts of commands.<p>[3] Speaking to yourself, or donning a finger-sock and waving your arm about like a mad-man will naturally lead to people trying to do that as little as possible. (said finger-sock simplifying a digit-tracking mechanism)<p>[4] The only plausible features from that video are simplified camera access, hands' free calling and turn-by-turn navigation.  And two of those are doable with existing bluetooth devices, while the third is only useful if Google can deliver a massive service upgrade to Maps, to include up-to-date coverage of building interiors.<p>The rest of that video are things people are increasingly dubious of <i>now</i> (always-on alerts and check-in based applications) or simply don't include a plausible interaction method.<p>[5] A conversation wherein ""Windows everywhere"" became <i>the goal</i>, despite any (in)applicability to the product.",1333635079

I moved from California, where the overall effective state+federal tax rates on the same income would be around 35% (also incl. payroll taxes).

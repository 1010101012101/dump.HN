If not Pinterest, has someone built an extension/plugin/third-party site that does this?<p>8) About/Team/Press - I had a side-project (not trivial to monetise) idea noted down that was slightly similar to this: maintaining beer pages for pubs/clubs/restaurants by mobile. Usually a pub will put up a crappy list of beers they have on tap or by bottle. Looking up any more info would be a pain. But if they embedded a script/iframe from said side-project, they could simply login from their phone and activate/deactivate to show the right beers, and the side-project site would serve up labels, descriptions, origin, alc%, etc. Venues could optionally list prices, mark specials or flag beers as available on tap/bottle/both.<p>The insanely large catalogue for wine would make this a lot harder to do in that market. (BTW, if you know of a way to get a database of all wine and decent bottle shots, let me know because I have a solid idea on the shelf that would work with that sort of information.)",1329090845

3583479,comment,3577562,3581145,1,0,mbrubeck,,,"Yes, SPDY is a great idea, and of course I don't think that it -- or other ideas -- should be rejected just because of who proposes them or when.  (As a concrete example, I am the lead editor of the W3C Touch Events spec and worked on implementing it in Gecko; it is an API that I absolutely believe should be standardized even though I strongly dislike how Apple originally designed and deployed it.)<p>I do think we agree on fundamentals though we may disagree on some cost-benefit analysis.  All I meant about the ""treadmill"" is that some proposals have a much greater cost to implementers than others, and different organizations will weigh those costs differently.  While some debaters may throw out ""political or emotional"" responses, I believe the decision-making process should be (and is, in the cases I've participated in) about allocation of resources, complexity of implementation, and the desired architecture of the web.<p>Technical issues and process issues are separate, but affect each other.  When I say the process behind something like Touch Events was bad, I'm not giving that as a reason to reject the feature -- I think the feature should be accepted or rejected on its merits, like you said -- but it does mean that any technical objections that do appear will be much harder to resolve than they might have been.  And as you say, Dart and NaCL have had better process behind them than Touch Events or various other extensions I could name.  Dart and NaCL may succeed or they may fail (just as many of Mozilla's current experiments may suceed or fail), but at least their fates will be influenced by feedback from all stakeholders.<p>You are obviously better informed than I am about Dart and NaCL implementation.  (Also, I accidentally conflated Go and Dart in my previous comment, which is embarrassing!)  I apologize for any uninformed comments and defer to you on all the facts there.<p>I really don't want people to see this as a ""Mozilla versus Google"" thread.  I hope everyone cares about standards issues because they help or hurt the web, not because they helps their favorite vendor or hurt a competing one.  In the big picture, Google and Mozilla are close allies when it comes to web standards.  As you say, the real risks to the open web are elsewhere.",1329090749

It supports multi-player mode by making multiple X11 server connections, so it can have more than one instance of each kind of window, one for each X11 server connection, and some windows can have multiple instances on each server (like the edit and map windows).<p>I had to write a lot of boilerplate infrastructure for creating/destroying windows and handling events, to store all the state for each window in global variables and structures, keyed by the window id, linked together symbolically, so windows on different screens don't clash, and even fix some bugs in Tk itself relating to having multiple windows on different servers: <a href=""http://code.google.com/p/micropolis/source/browse/trunk/micropolis-activity/res/micropolis.tcl#702"" rel=""nofollow"">http://code.google.com/p/micropolis/source/browse/trunk/micr...</a><p>To create each window it would reload a file like this each time that set up all the globals and window links and bindings like ""LinkWindow $head.map $win"" and ""bind $win <Visibility> {[WindowLink %W.view] Visible [string compare %s FullyObscured]}"".

The answer varies based on a range of criteria, as well as who you are (i.e. profit-maximizing business, or price-sensitive, value-maximizing customer).<p>Some key criteria that matters to both parties:<p>- Difference in price/revenue between one-time and recurring: If the recurring revenue stands to significantly exceed the one-time fee (accounting for attrition and those who decide not to buy into the subscription), a SaaS model is attractive to the business, and not to the price sensitive customer.<p>- How steep would the one-time fee be (and who is the decision-maker, i.e. will they have the budget for this?): If the one-time fee would be so steep that a lot of IT managers (or whoever the buyer is) won't have authority or willingness to front the cash, a SaaS model makes sense. This is a case in which both the sellers and buyers prefer a lower cost (even if it results in a higher long term expense for the consumer since the buyer may be spending out of a bureaucratic budget that they don't want to under-use, i.e. when budgets are slashed for being under-used).<p>- Likelihood of renewal: If the seller does not think that you will renew (due to low switching costs, an inferior product, etc.), then an upfront fee maximizes profit. If you think you are likely to renew time and time again, the buyer probably prefers the one-time fee because that is likely lower than a subscription cost in the long run. So, again, the seller and buyer are at odds: buyers who will renew would rather an upfront cost to save money, sellers expecting buyers to renew want an ongoing subscription fee.<p>There are surely other criteria; what else would you add?<p>It seems like SaaS pricing model pits seller and buyer at odds because of conflicting incentives. But as the SaaS model grows more prevalent, it can be expected that buyers/consumers will basically just have to deal with it, as they have with exorbitant annual software licenses in the past. For SaaS startups this means opportunity; for consumers it seems to mean continually increasing costs under the guise of frequent updates, flexibility to cancel, and an easier ability to try out software within corporate budget limits.",1329088938

3583338,comment,3580617,3580617,3,0,onlawschool,,,"Dennis Chookaszian, former CEO of CNA Insurance Companies, recently told me ""Pick Two: Work, Family, Personal. I have never known anyone to be successful at all three."" This message resonated with me.<p>Chookaszian has chosen work and family. By all accounts, he has been very successful professionally and the stories he recounts about his family, casually woven into almost every conversation I've had with him, I am lead to believe that he has also managed to maintain great relationships with his wife and children.<p>In order to pursue successful and meaningful work and family lives, he had to give up his personal interests. As a young man he loved working on cars. He got a great deal of enjoyment out of fixing up old Porshes. About 30 years ago he purchased a Porshe that needed an engine rebuild. He took the engine out of the car and began working on it. Meanwhile, he got married and had children. Where is that engine today? It sits, neglected, in the same place and condition that he left it in 30 years ago. ""I now know that engine will still be sitting there long after I am gone,"" he quipped.<p>In that same conversation, he also made another keen observation: ""When someone says that they want 'work/life balance,' what they really mean is that they don't want to be in an executive position."" For CEOs of successful companies, there isn't such thing as work/life balance. If you want that balance, you can be successful in middle management, but only those who are truly passionate and dedicated to their work make successful CEOs.<p>To illustrate the point, he mentioned a recent email he received from the CEO of a company. Chookaszian is a director on the board of the firm, and the company was dealing with a crisis. The CEO wanted to let him know that he would be out of town for about a week on vacation. The notion that someone would follow through with vacation plans in the midst of a company crisis was, in his view, absurd. ""As a director, when I heard news of the company crisis, I cut short my ski trip with my wife and flew home on the next flight in order to deal with the issue."" If the CEO felt that his vacation plans superseded his obligations as a CEO, it wasn't likely that he would have a job to come back to after his trip.<p>This doesn't mean that you can't have a solid relationship with your family. However, success in business requires that you first fulfill your obligation to the company and its constituents. That duty will require sacrifice. It will require long hours at the office, vacations cut short, and kids' soccer games missed. When there is a critical decision to be made at the company, that must come first. The additional difficulty in the start-up context is that, in a company's infancy, critical decisions are being made almost constantly.<p>However, it also doesn't mean that you can't maintain happy relationships with your family members, but something has got to give. Namely, personal interests must be sacrificed.<p>Work, family, personal. Pick Two.",1329087798

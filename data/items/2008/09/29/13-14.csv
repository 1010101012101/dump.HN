318326,comment,318008,318094,0,0,mechanical_fish,,,"<i>I am careful not to diagnose myself or others and using labels: OCD, ADD, depressive, etc... The reason I am careful about labeling is I don't think the diagnoses are accurate enough.</i><p>Any psychologist worth their salt would agree with you: Diagnoses are blunt instruments which we use to describe what are, in reality, complex and unique collections of individual traits and tendencies. There is indeed a risk in ""labeling"" someone.<p>But, on the other hand, psychologists often do it anyway. Because the labels also have advantages. The biggest one is: Labels force you to acknowledge the existence of correlations. It is a sad but true fact that some people commit suicide. Other people drink themselves to death. But it's very, very hard to look at your best friend -- or at yourself -- and think <i>this person is about to kill themselves</i> or <i>this person is an alcoholic</i>. Your mind just slides off the subject, like water off a waxed car. You don't want to believe that, so you don't. That's why people always act so surprised. ""Who could have predicted that such a successful writer could kill themselves?""<p>The answer is that sometimes you can't predict it. But one useful way of predicting it is to have a list of warning signs, and to apply (as clinically and scientifically as possible) a special label to anyone who exhibits seven out of ten warning signs. You can't always just listen to your gut, because your gut can be a <i>hopeless</i> optimist -- you force yourself to listen to the label. Then we can take action based on the label -- we give people insurance money to pay for extra therapy, give them access to special drugs, invite them out for coffee instead of beer, encourage them to call (or not to call) their moms, and/or make allowances for their behavior (""Oh, perhaps he's <i>not</i> sending an obvious social signal that he hates my guts! Perhaps he's just having an Asperger's moment!"" Is that a glib diagnosis? You bet. But if only I had a dollar for every time that explanation has come in handy...)<p>Another advantage of labels is that they <i>literally</i> aren't personal. We treat the labelled condition as if it were somehow separate from a person's regular personality -- and that's often <i>not</i> a bug in our labelling system, but a feature! It enables us to distinguish ""a guy who sometimes seems nice but is in fact a complete jerk"" from ""a nice guy, except when he's drunk"". We can distinguish ""a guy who just doesn't have it together"" from ""a clinically depressed guy"", each of whom requires different treatment. You can try to help the first guy cheer up by encouraging him to change his life, or buying him a pizza, or perhaps just mindlessly telling him to ""look on the bright side"". You can't do that for the clinically depressed, as Will tells us in no uncertain terms:<p>""Some people have never dealt with depression, and they can't figure out how it's different from 'being sad.' 'I've been sad! I don't whine about it! I just get over it.' Yes, that's nice. Also, not the same.""<p>As someone who was once depressed, but turned out not to have <i>depression</i>, I tend to think that the label is very useful. Otherwise I might have tried antidepressant treatments <i>before</i> I tried changing my city and my job. Conversely, if I <i>did</i> have depression, but were unwilling to accept that diagnosis, I might spend my time moving randomly from city to city instead of accepting my condition, seeking long-term treatment, and explaining it to my friends.",1222696119

First off if you have a sequence ...1 and ...0 at infinity they are the same number so saying you flip the last bit does not demonstrate that the above number is not in your set.<p>Secondly, if you take the Integer set and say N = the sum of all numbers > 0 you have counted, then you will never reach N as you go to infinity.<p>PS: This is why I went to CS there is no way to verify that a given proof or program is accurate but that does not stop a program from being useful.<p>Edit: Restating the second argument: Start with all zero's, count in binary from the left, 1000.. > 0100.. > 1100.. > ... and the diagonal becomes 1111111 which is basically just a higher order of infinity like N = the sum of all prior numbers.",1222695740
318316,comment,317759,317759,0,0,peakok,,,"Good post. It is also the end of the anglo-saxon ""know it all"" diktat over finance. It was unthinkable a couple of months ago that New York and London would suddenly disappear from the map of global finance, bringing down with them the whole world of investment banking and its rules. It'll eventually come back, but it'll never be the same.<p>Still, it is puzzling why the United States are keeping the people who led them into this mess in position. Historically wise, there is absolutely no reason to expect them making good decisions of all the sudden. On the contrary, it fuels an aura of suspicion (biaised interests, corruption, lack of competence, ...) that is prejuciable when you need the other countries to trust you. Isn't it time to make room for the people who got it right and have the kind of global vision necessary to lead during such a crisis ?",1222695699

318310,comment,318008,318094,0,0,marvin,,,"Therapy has worked wonders for me. But it's not something you do for a couple of months and then conclude the process by living a happy life. Your problems are part of you, and you can't just throw a part of yourself out of the window in a short time.<p>I've been in various forms of psychotherapy for two years now, taking medication when it was necessary. To be specific: characteristics of OCD and schizoid PD as symptoms of depression and social anxiety. The personality traits were not prominent enough to warrant a diagnosis in itself.<p>In therapy, you get to know yourself better: there are probably reasons why you have certain problems. If you dig deeper in them, you probably get to a point where there are no more reasons. As a random example: you obsess because you fear (x) because you were on multiple occasions in a painful situation regarding (x), and this situation was painful because of (y) and (y) is painful for you but not for others because...and at one point, you might run out of good reasons. But getting to know yourself better helps, and exposing yourself to these issues can give you tools to make them less pressing. Dampening the oscillations, as it were. I have seen plenty of examples where this has made life easier for people, but it takes at least a couple of years. In the US, this might be a tricky proposition because 300 hours of attention from a psychologist is expensive. I hope you have good health insurance, but if you have a well-paying job, I'd say it is worth it.<p>We nerds are often suspicious of processes that are unpredictable, messy and nondeterministic, but any treatment to psychological issues will necessarily have these characteristics. It doesn't mean that it is pointless. These issues can rarely be cured, but they can be managed and mended.",1222695066

I've never been hit myself, but I've had many close calls:<p>1) About two months back I saw a girl on a bike get hit by a guy who ""didn't see her"" because, as he claims, he was watching me (I was about 10m back). He was on a minor street crossing a major street. We were on the major street, and she got hit side-on. She was fine, by the way, just scrapes on her legs and hands (a doctor happened to be nearby, and he checked her over).<p>2) I almost got sideswiped by a guy turning right off a minor highway. Had to pull on the brakes and swerve left into the lane to avoid him. Thankfully there were no cars there.<p>3) As I was stopping at a stoplight, a pickup truck pulled up behind me. The guy inside apparently didn't like how far from the curb I was. He stuck his head out the window, swearing about how he's going to run me over. I yell back, tell him to mind his own business, then make a quick right turn to avoid him.<p>I could go on.

If you write an OS in a dynamic language you need either a GC in a low-level language or one that does not produce garbage itself. If you want a realtime-OS, garbage collection will make things much more complicated.<p>Other dynamic featues like multiple dispatch at runtime may also slow down the system and create an unnecessary bottleneck at such a low level.<p>> Why hasn't anyone created a better systemprogramming langauge?<p>Java is a very good systems programming language for Processors that have Java bytecode as machine code.<p>Oberon is a better language to write the Oberon system in than C. There is also a lot of low-level programming going on with Ada. Oberon and Ada are both derived from Pascal and seem very un-dynamic to me. Depending on your definition of better, they may be better sytem programming languages.",1219668435

But we do plan to add more markets (counties) as we roll out more.<p>I have yet to find a good alternative - there are a few places that offer up the data already indexed, but they either have limits on the searches per day, or a ToS that does not allow the data to be repackaged commercially.  If there was an API out there, even if we had to pay for access, that allowed to search for the data we needed with no cobranding (or less cobranding than Zillow) we'd use it.  For now, we'll put up a few more nodes and index the data ourselves.",1219667841
285839,comment,285717,285803,0,0,gigawatt,,,"Exactly. Many people aren't choosing to still use IE6 - the choice is being made for them. I work onsite in a non-profit sometimes, and they are all still on IE6 until the IT dept decides it's safe/worth it to upgrade. (EDIT: And I do my part to convince them it is safe and worth it.)<p>I feel like every month or so, a big site says ""Death to IE6,"" then people point out that it's not always an individual decision to upgrade, then someone like marijn points out the most reasonable solution. Make sure the content comes through, make sure it doesn't look completely ridiculous, and educate clients as you go. And if you're lucky, like 37signals, you can decide for your clients. We'll get there eventually.",1219667612

285836,comment,285193,285830,0,0,byrneseyeview,,,"I'm not claiming that the single distinguishing feature of Mormons is that they're universally unkind to outsiders, but when you deal with an unusual group, it's the outliers who can really show you that there's something unusual going on. Just for example, it would completely blow my mind if I found out that there was an auto mechanic who had the same curiosity, panache, explanatory talent, etc. as Richard Feynman. This isn't because I think mechanics are all dumber than physicists, or that there aren't some smart mechanics or some dumb physicists (I know one person who I believe <i>was</i> a mechanic before becoming a physicist). But hearing about another Feynman-style physicist would not be such a big deal.<p>Similarly, the average Mormon is probably fairly indistinguishable from the average American, or the average resident of whatever country that Mormon lives in. But when you look at the outliers -- the ones with really nasty in-group hostility, the ones who work eighty hours a week <i>and</i> do volunteer work on weekends, the ones to whom seven kids would be a 'good start' -- you figure Mormons might be half a standard deviation more in-group centered, industrious, and fertile. And at that point, it's just Bayesian inference: you find out someone is a Mormon, you change your estimates of the chance that they have other characteristics, too.<p><i>they're too big to stereotype as individuals, any more than Americans, Mexicans, Catholics, Muslims, left handers, computer programmers, etc.</i><p>I stereotype all of these groups in the same ways. It may be misguided, but it's a good way to experience your surprises in bulk and in advance. Always efficient.",1219666698

They can index domains in any zone as long as their content is in Russian.<p>Anyway IMHO Google gives better search results in Russian.

285831,comment,285435,285585,0,0,wheels,,,"Your usefulness guarantee isn't reassuring because it says, basically, ""If you find my help completely useless you get a refund,"" rather than, ""If you find my help not worth $450, you get a refund.""<p>Also the block on ""how usability helps"" basically says nothing.  It might as well just say, ""Usability is good!""  You're going to have to fork over a lot stronger value proposition than that before getting someone to pay for the service.  Don't just get reference customers; get reference customer numbers.  ""With Really Cool Customer Foo, signups went up by 128% within two weeks.""<p>The selling yourself bit, I'll be a little harsher (in hopes of helping), it basically says, ""I've done this for some of my buddies sites and they think it's neat.""  Again, not a strong value proposition.  Just cut that part out if you don't have a better case to make; that portion actually makes you sound <i>less</i> qualified that I would have assumed by default.",1219665874

There were also a lot more whose behavior I did like.<p>Mormons make up 95% of the 30K student body, so if there's <i>anyone</i> there you don't like, they're probably a Mormon.  Mormons are a big enough group (especially at BYU) that standard statistical rules apply - some are jerks, some are racist, some are angels, some and the nicest people in the world, and most are decent people with the usual character flaws.  There are over 5 million Mormons in America and 12 million in the world, so they're too big to stereotype as individuals, any more than Americans, Mexicans, Catholics, Muslims, left handers, computer programmers, etc.",1219665871

5176317,comment,5174482,5174759,2,0,ndonnellan,,,"Perhaps the initial demand for something like USD was due to legal effects like tax codes and bankruptcy laws, but I would think the primary demand today is network-effects. If I want to participate in a transaction within the US borders, almost any transaction, I must use USD. Therefore I need USD. Most of my transactions have nothing to do with said legal structures.<p>I think it's hard to say that Bitcoin's demand principally comes from technical features (without proof). Certainly there are those that want secure online payments and so buy BTC but there are others that buy BTC because they think it will be more valuable in the future (relative to USD) if it gains more traction. Additional demand: low transaction costs for international exchange (I remember reading an article about Iranian nationals using BTC to sidestep export/import restrictions).<p>But I definitely share the frustration of explaining perceived value. From an economics stand-point, ""perceived value"" is redundant. Value is by definition an abstract concept that humans (or other creatures) attach to something based on how much they desire it.",1360159150

I loved my manager to death, and telling him I was leaving felt kind of like breaking up with a long-term girlfriend.

For a small fraction of people who are very lucky this is almost useful, but everyone else needs be able to handle what could negatively be described as rebuilding after disaster or positively described as lifelong learning.  You shouldn't stop ""beginning"" until you're dead, not on your 30th birthday or whatever.  Never stop ""beginning"".<p>Always be resilient...  Ask any ""old"" person, eventually, you're gonna crash and burn even if you think you're conservative.  What really separates the winners from the losers is how you react when at the bottom, not when peaking or at the top...<p>Another thing worth considering is living in the world, not in a plan, although goals are OK.  A plan is nice, but as an engineer I assure you that physical reality follows its laws, not your plan, and you'd best get used to living in the world instead of in a plan.  Not that planning as an abstract concept is always a waste of time, it just usually is.  Goals are good and are not detailed plans.  A goal is something like meet the ideal spouse and live happily with them.  A plan has ridiculous metrics and set pointless scheduled firm dates, like meet spouse at exactly age 26, married by 28, squirt out precisely 2.1 kids by 32, etc.  Plans are doomed to failure and unhappiness, goals on the other hand are OK.<p>Finally a really good piece of advice is broaden your horizons and question your definitions, especially if the definitions don't benefit you and come from people making a profit off you.  ""Kids"" think the definition of socializing is staying up all night drinking until you vomit and make a fool of yourself then miss work the next day.  Therefore the 20s are when you should socialize.  Uh, no, you need a new definition of socialize and you should be doin it all your life not just 20s or until your liver gives out.  I was ignorant too, and I survived and improved since, so don't feel bad if you have to do the same.",1360156367

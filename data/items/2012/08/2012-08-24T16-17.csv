Compared to default UI, where you have strokes on top of strokes, you have those other minimal circles that live around the map, you have all these options. Your addon essentially removed those from the map UI (or hide them till user wants them/turns them on), hence minimalism. You have different skins, but they don't take away from the function of your addon. It's minimalism is constant.

This was long before Linq came along.<p>Edit2:<p><pre><code>  > There were years and years where IEnumerable simply defined an object that could be enumerated...
</code></pre>
Which is my point exactly. And nothing has changed with IEnumerable (generics excluded). It certainly doesn't say that all the objects are already held in-memory (as enforcing ToList would do). By returning an IEnumerable, you're just saying here's an object that can produce you a sequence of results. In a public API, it should be documented (at least some vague allusion to) whether this will be produced by trivially pulling them out of an in-memory list, or whether something a bit more clever is going on, as there'll certainly be occasions where streaming the results through a generator is more desirable than holding them all in memory.",1345827334

This is well established in civil law and tax taw.<p>When I see a story about bitcoin I read it once, then read it again substituting the words pet rocks for the word bitcoin. I ask 'is there anything specific to bitcoin about the concerns being raised?' and the answer is almost always no.<p>If I buy some pet rocks at a garage sale in August and sell them at my garage sale in September for more money, I record the profit or loss, report it on my tax return and pay the appropriate income tax on it.

If you think _anything_ widely used can be, you are woefully underestimating the power of a modern major state.<p>This isn't a question about technology; as much as the geeks love to obsess over it. Technology is just one part.  Non-technology attacks are simply much more powerful. E.g. ""Anyone caught using Bitcoin will be executed on the spot by large caliber fire from attack helicopters flying far enough away that you can't see or hear them targeting you"", and suddenly Bitcoin is only some obscure and irrelevant thing even outlaws have no use for outlaw 'money'. There is no question of _ability_ to suppress it, only a question of sufficient motivation.<p>And motivation is where it comes up short. Bitcoin is just another thing people can barter. Not different from beanie babies or lumps of coal, and it shouldn't be legally or politically different. This whole weird concept of something being unlawful until proven otherwise must be some kind of crazy fallout from the drug and copyright wars, and I fear that thinking will greatly harm society in the long run.<p>If Bitcoin turns out to be an efficient 'money' then sane and efficient governments should support it: because a more efficient money will make everyone more prosperous. Some people love to feel all counter-culture and subversive with their hobbies, but as disruptive a technology Bitcoin is it's just not politically disruptive. Most of the few establishment risks that go along with Bitcoin apply doubly to cash, the others apply to other valuable commodities that goverments can't just create out of thin air.

But it's messy out of the box for other parts of your app without boilerplate. You need to structure your events somehow. It doesn't take much code and the libraries that I recommend are very small.<p>I don't think Backbone necessarily needs more features. It's great for certain sites that uses Backbone in limited ways. I'm talking about making an entire website end to end in Backbone, something that most of your examples do not try to do. But if you're making a whole app in backbone, not just a feature or a widget, something with many many routes and regions that swap nested views constantly, you'll need a bigger library.<p>So, backbone alone is fine for apps that's mostly traditional / server based, with some client side features.

</code></pre>
JavaScript has memory management; JavaScript has a garbage collector. If you structure an app (with any library) not to leak references, then no manual memory management or bookkeeping is needed. Not having additional memory management is a feature, not a bug.<p><pre><code>    > Does it provide a pub/sub pattern?
</code></pre>
Yes. That's Backbone.Events, which is the core how models work with changes, and can be mixed in to any object.<p><pre><code>    > Does it handle views/nesting subviews and layout management? 
</code></pre>
Right -- your UI and your HTML is your business. Not having an explicit view hierarchy or layout paradigm is part of the reason why Backbone Views can be used in the kinds of diverse environments you see in that list of examples ... from ""enhanced"" static pages like Pitchfork.com, to interactive SVG-based graphics like SeakGeek's stadium maps, to multiplatform hybrid web/native views like LinkedIn Mobile.<p>That said, if you think you've got an idea for a ""layout"" feature that would help with UI across the spectrum, it would make for a great pull request.",1345825693

An 'open' LINQ query might represent a whole lot of work, and that work will get repeated every time someone re-enumerates the query. And the query might be holding on to any number of resources that the end-user can't know about.  Returning a data structure instead of an unexecuted query makes it much easier for people who are working with your library to know what they're working with, because what they're working with is simply the contents of the data structure.  To that end, it's preferable according to the ""pit of success"" principle.<p>But that flip-flops when you're only dealing with the inside an assembly.

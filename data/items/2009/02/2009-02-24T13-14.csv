I think it's very hard for a person's style to shine through in a 1 page typed document, so I don't look for it and I don't disqualify people for lacking it.<p>In fact, I object to the entire idea that you can make a cog/non-cog determination from a sheet of paper.<p>The resume just gets you in the front door. It gets you an interview where someone can actually try to figure out what kind of an employee you will be. It's a first-round check on whether you even <i>claim</i> to have the relevant experience.",1235482901

I actually prefer the customer relationship a lot more than I do that of employer/employee in that either one of is pretty much free to do as we please - they don't have to buy my stuff or my services, and if they're seriously annoying, I can decide I don't want them as a customer, or simply ignore them.  Granted, you can't always do that, but still... it's just a happier situation than having to order people around, or having someone order you around.",1235481303

Got a small thecnical degree, worked for 3.5 years..<p>But my job sucked! So I decided to go to university!<p>Why? It's a transition!
At university yes you get shit to do (in computer science the classes are horrible and disconnected from realty!!)<p>But, there is no place like university to build a startup and make connections! So that's the main reason I stick to university :) Plus where I got in Qu√©bec they credit me one year + the interm because of my work experience.<p>So...<p>You will hate going to university because the classes are boring it's not practical, but you get a good degree.<p>But what can help you put up with the BS and really stand out is building a startup, joining toastmasters, building connection with people and making contacts, etc.<p>And when you know that most universities are like 60,000 people ""little cities"" that are all connected to the same community, it feel good :)<p>So... while it may not be your answer, I love what I do! And in university there are some companies that are actually taking students for a job! I see ""We need 25 programmers"" ads in the bathrooms :P hahahaha",1235480791

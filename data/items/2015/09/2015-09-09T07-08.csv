Private is going to jump on that stuff first, of course.<p>Robocars constitute a percentage improvement at the surface, but don&#x27;t overcome inherent capacity/land-use/energy tradeoffs between a packed subway car and a congested highway. You cannot get around the problem of automobiles using more space. [0]<p>You will have robocars, but also robobuses and robotrains. This is a &quot;all over, everywhere, better&quot; improvement, not a &quot;this one wins and crushes the others.&quot; Flexibility is important - the city is making some progress on bike paths and can continue doing much better still.<p>Furthermore, better architecture, land use, and future lifestyle changes hold the potential to keep density at a higher average level while improving the feeling of street life to be more like the &quot;peaceful suburban&quot; ideal - walkable, yet quiet and non-disruptive. Framing transportation as a land-use problem - something built up from prior decisions about what real estate to build and where to build it in order to minimize average trip times and potential disruptions - rather than an engineering exercise of making as many roads and rails and tunnels and bridges as you can so that every vehicle may race along at 200 MPH for the smallest errand - drastically changes what you can do and the budget you can accomplish it with, which makes it more likely to be realized in our lifetimes.<p>That said, I agree with the article. SF has fallen far behind its housing demand, and the lack of a &quot;virtuous cycle&quot; of transit projects to encourage development in outlying neighborhoods shares some blame in that. It should not be the case that it&#x27;s harder to go between downtown and the Richmond than to make the same trip to Oakland.<p>[0] <a href=""https://www.flickr.com/photos/carltonreid/7999178447/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.flickr.com/photos/carltonreid/7999178447/</a>",1441785093

All the potential and kinetic energy in the system is transferred to the person, who may be unprepared. Depending on the child’s mass, the energy transfer may be equivalent to falling from 2.2m or 3.4 m equivalent to a fall from a first floor window7.

10190255,comment,10186531,10189909,0,0,teek,,,"> Even Tokyo has most of it&#x27;s trains above ground. See Yamanote line with 29 stations versus the 16 cumulative underground stations that both the Tokyo Waterfront Area Rapid Transit and Saitama Rapid Railway Line serve.<p>I&#x27;ve lived in Tokyo for a year, and this comment is grossly ignorant.<p>First of all, Tokyo Metro is just <i>one</i> subway <i>company</i> in the region. Tokyo Metro according to Wikipedia has 142 unique stations, most of which are underground.<p>For surface trains, the Yamanote loop line circles central Tokyo, with Chuo-Sobu cutting through the center. There are other surface trains that <i>feed</i> into central Tokyo but don&#x27;t necessarily take you <i>through</i> Tokyo. There are some trains that also run along sections of the Yamanote line like the Keihin-Tohoku line and Saikyo line.<p>Other than those lines, if you want to travel around central Tokyo (within the area circled by Yamanote, you will most likely ride a Tokyo Metro subway (underground) or a Toei Subway (underground). Toei is the other major subway company in the region.<p>If anything, Japan and Tokyo is proof that SF and LA have no reason to <i>not</i> build subways despite their seismically active areas. Remember, Japan, including the Tokyo region, was hit with a 9.0 magnitude earthquake recently and many other high magnitude earthquakes in the last century alone. Tokyo is proof that earthquakes can be mitigated.<p>If there&#x27;s one engineering failure of Tokyo it would be reclaimed land. A large portion of Tokyo (famously Odaiba, and Haneda Airport) are built on reclaimed land. This type of land shows problems especially due to earthquakes. For this reason residents tend to shy away from purchasing houses in these areas because there&#x27;s a high risk of issues with the soil and foundations. But this makes perfect sense, reclaimed land is basically dumping dirt into what used to be water to make more land.<p>---<p>The only way this comment gets remotely close to accurate is if it is counting for the entire Tokyo <i>region</i> and not just Central Tokyo. But this would be the equivalent of comparing the entire Bay area. Outside of central Tokyo, the trains do run on the surface. But Tokyo uses trains as a primary means of transportation so lines can continue for hours as they go into remote areas of Tokyo or connect to other lines despite different ownership of the track. For example it is possible to take a single train (no transfers) from Haneda airport to Narita airport. The ride will take over 2 hours but you will have technically traveled on 3 separate lines operated by 3 separate rail companies. Oh and one of those lines is a subway line.",1441784880

So they made up this &quot;oh my god the kids are going to die!&quot; scare; the local congressman, Henry Waxman, backed them by getting the BH route blocked at the Federal level until 2007.<p>The MTA then brought up the alternative of sending the train through West Hollywood instead, bypassing BH altogether, and the city caved right quick.<p>God I love local politics.<p>[1] <a href=""https://www.google.com/maps/place/@34.0670703,-118.401029,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m2!3m1!1s0x80c2bbf8e2bb5727:0xcea858680180beed"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.google.com/maps/place/@34.0670703,-118.401029,17...</a><p>[2] <a href=""https://www.google.com/maps/place/Beverly+Hills,+CA+90210/@34.0670136,-118.4104353,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m2!3m1!1s0x80c2bbf5fe3bf84d:0x34e887f3a4feb0c2"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.google.com/maps/place/Beverly+Hills,+CA+90210/@3...</a><p>[3] <a href=""https://www.google.com/maps/place/2000+Avenue+of+the+Stars,+Los+Angeles,+CA+90067/@34.0587061,-118.4161226,18z/data=!4m2!3m1!1s0x80c2bbf321bfc969:0xe46a66e8c6d5c48"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.google.com/maps/place/2000+Avenue+of+the+Stars,+...</a>",1441784750

If a complex event has numerous subscribers that all must complete, it is very difficult to provide guarantees of consistency even if it is eventual.

I mean the warranty will be voided... which i my mind seams fair.",1441782187

What the author demands is documentation.<p>I would love more documentation, like anyone, but you don&#x27;t really need any documentation to replace a broken capacitor (a very common failure for most screens, I guess): you need to know how to spot a broken capacitor, find a replacement, and basic soldering skills. There are tons of videos that teach that, but few people really want to research that (generally because they are afraid of electronics, or think they are not smart enough).<p>On the other end, some issues can&#x27;t be fixed at all, because repairing is so close to the full price of the device. Some examples that happened to me: inflating smartphone battery that damages the motherboard, damaged screen due to shock (wide vertical band of dead pixels).<p>Between that, there are probably a lot of small problems that are specific to a particular model. It would be great that those ones are documented, indeed.<p>Some other basic things, like replacing a smartphone/laptop battery and screens would be very welcome on the manufacturer website, but like capacitors, you should be able to find tutorials for a lot of devices.<p>The truth is, to repair things, you need mostly knowledge to identify problems and labor time to fix things. Both of which is what makes it expensive.",1441782117

Having lived in each for a year, you can expect to experience more activity in two weeks in Tokyo than a year in SF.<p>Also, claiming that most of Tokyos subway is above ground is incorrect. The subways, Tokyo metro and Toei, are nearly entirely underground within the city center. This is hundreds of stations. Yamanote line is part of an entirely different set of trains for longer distance transit.",1441782078

It does not exist the way you think it does.<p>That&#x27;s not the illusion I was talking about though. It&#x27;s one thing to read about that, but it&#x27;s quite another to directly experience this. Like @kordless said, this is a repeatable process where you can see this for yourself. (And there&#x27;s a great book written by a neuroscientist who also practices mindful meditation, and wrote about these two perspectives).<p>This is also not limited to the Buddhist tradition, though the sutrayana Buddhist teaches this as the primary thing and speaks the loudest about it.

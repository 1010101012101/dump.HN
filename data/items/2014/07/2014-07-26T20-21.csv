You criticize, for example, the Law of Equivalent Exchange as reflecting a primitive and pessimistic worldview, and also as being something that can be used to justify Luddism and ambivalence towards technology. But that&#x27;s like blaming the shovel for digging the hole. Sure, it was used to dig the hole, but that hole was going to be dug either way (unless we take away ALL tools, including hands -- and THAT would be some extreme Luddism). If people want to rationalize and justify their prejudices, it hardly matters to them how they go about doing so -- as long as they do do so. Also, win-win situations exist within the Law of Equivalent Exchange -- it sounds like you think it could promote an overly position-based worldview (as opposed to a principle-based one), and I agree that, untempered with moderation, it could potentially lead to such a thing. However, if this advice is taken with moderation (as I suspect it typically will be), I see no harm in it, and actually some value in it.<p>-WrennGo",1406408286

8090728,comment,8090580,8090580,6,0,btilly,,,"Java was marketed in the 1990s as a cross-platform language that was basically a better version of C++ for use on the web.  Of the languages that were associated with the early web, Java was the only one with large corporate support.  (Contrast to the then-dominant web language, Perl.  And consider that the phrase &quot;open source&quot; had not yet been coined.)  First from Sun, and then from other companies like IBM and Oracle that feared an all Microsoft future.<p>Thanks to the corporate support that went into it, Java built strong ecosystems in a number of areas.  The viability of multiple strong corporate supporters made it a safe choice for any enterprise that wanted an option that was tied to the web which wasn&#x27;t tied to Microsoft.  This gave them a base that it never lost.<p>It is worth noting that Microsoft took note of this competitor, and did their standard &quot;embrace, extend, extinguish&quot; approach.  However they got sued by Sun for adding Windows only extensions, and after they lost that, Sun was able to ensure continued consistency.<p>Random note.  Java is far from the first portable cross-platform language to be marketed on that basis.  See COBOL.<p>Random amusing note.  While Java was marketed as being cross-platform, it used threading in a way that Solaris was designed for and competing Unix systems were not.

8090707,comment,8088842,8089658,5,0,derf_,,,"Well, part of this is that some of these are just &quot;solved problems&quot;. For example, once you have arithmetic coding, you never have to worry about the actual bitwise encoding again (anything on top of that is just speed optimization). That reduces the problem to modeling and probability estimation.<p>There&#x27;s an inherent limit at the entropy of the source, and usually it is not <i>too</i> hard to get within a few percent of that entropy (as near as we are able to model it). After that, you can do increasingly complex things, but for rapidly diminishing returns. For example, there are definitely lossless audio compressors that can make things smaller than FLAC, but usually only by a percent or two, and they are an order of magnitude or more slower.<p>To me, a lot of the interesting research at this point is exploring the compression/speed trade-off. That&#x27;s what makes LZMA interesting (it dominates bzip2 on both axes). Google has also done some interesting work in this space. This matters when your goal is to save network transmission time: if you&#x27;re only sending the data once, anything you do has to be faster than just sending more data on the wire.",1406407039

Today, these trends have reached their extreme—but in the wake of their collapse, we may find great opportunity to transition to a more connected, ecological, and sustainable way of being.<p>This book is about how the money system will have to change—and is already changing—to embody this transition. A broadly integrated synthesis of theory, policy, and practice, Sacred Economics explores avant-garde concepts of the New Economics, including negative-interest currencies, local currencies, resource-based economics, gift economies, and the restoration of the commons. Author Charles Eisenstein also considers the personal dimensions of this transition, speaking to those concerned with &quot;right livelihood&quot; and how to live according to their ideals in a world seemingly ruled by money. Tapping into a rich lineage of conventional and unconventional economic thought, Sacred Economics presents a vision that is original yet commonsense, radical yet gentle, and increasingly relevant as the crises of our civilization deepen.<p>Sacred Economics official website: <a href=""http://sacred-economics.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://sacred-economics.com</a>",1406406609

8090633,comment,8086216,8089684,1,0,antognini,,,"Sure!  In classical mechanics it&#x27;s nice when you have a problem for which the solution is integrable.  Oftentimes these solutions will also be periodic.  One very useful example of this is an elliptical orbit---the object will return to the same position in the orbit at equal intervals.  Unfortunately, there aren&#x27;t very many problems that are simple enough to have periodic solutions in the real world.  While Mars&#x27;s orbit is approximately periodic, perturbations from Jupiter cause it to vary a little bit, so it&#x27;s not strictly periodic.  Now, we know from observations that the orbit of Mars is <i>almost</i> an ellipse, so these perturbations from Jupiter don&#x27;t blow up and cause Mars to go careening through the Solar System.  Intuitively, it makes sense that this should be possible because if you have some infinitesimally small perturbation, the orbit should remain approximately the same as the unperturbed orbit.<p>The question the KAM theorem answers is &quot;Under what kinds of perturbations do the perturbed orbits remain approximately the same as the unperturbed orbits?&quot;  The answer is that if the perturbations are (1) small, (2) smooth, and (3) non-resonant, then the perturbed orbits will be close to the unperturbed orbits.  Now, condition (1) doesn&#x27;t tell you exactly how small those perturbations need to be---only that they exist if they&#x27;re small enough.  Condition (2) will be met for any realistic system---it just prevents you from choosing some pathological perturbation function like the Weierstrass function.  Condition (3) basically states that if the perturbation is periodic, then the ratio between its frequency and the frequency of the orbit must be an irrational number.  If you had, for example, a 1:1 resonance, so the two frequencies are the same, then the perturbation will be applied at the same spot in every orbit.  It will then build up over time until it will eventually have a large effect and the perturbation will no longer be small.<p>The KAM theorem goes further, too.  If you look at the unperturbed orbit in phase space, it will just trace out a nice, simple ellipse (or, in general, some closed loop).  Since the perturbed orbit will be close to the unperturbed orbit, the KAM theorem also tells you what shape it will have in phase space.  By energetic arguments, the KAM theorem tells you that the perturbed orbit is restricted to a torus centered around the unperturbed orbit.  This is what&#x27;s called the invariant torus.  Not only is the perturbed orbit restricted to this torus, but given enough time, the perturbed orbit fills out the entire torus.  The perturbed orbit will eventually come arbitrarily close to any point on the torus.  (I believe this is due to the non-resonance condition---that is, if the perturbed orbit was strictly periodic then there would be a resonance between the perturbation and the orbit---but I&#x27;m not sure on this point.)<p>These orbits are known as quasiperiodic because they are confined to a torus centered around a periodic orbit, but they never strictly repeat themselves.",1406405838

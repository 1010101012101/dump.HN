You can consider a &quot;noun&quot; to be one instance of a verb&#x27;s application, i.e., an action. For example, &quot;send an email&quot; or &quot;purchase an item&quot;, both verbs, translate to creating new nouns representing (respectively) an email in my Outbox or a transaction. The advantage of the noun worldview is that the nouns can describe the history of verbs and the resulting application state, e.g., I can look at and manage the whole ledger of transactions, whereas verbs are just ad-hoc manipulations of that state.",1399949472

7736316,comment,7736167,7736307,1,0,charlieflowers,,,"Here&#x27;s my initial guess as someone just beginning to learn the language. Imagine you have a data structure that you need to work with, and many funcs which operate on it. Striving for functional style, you&#x27;d prefer these funcs not to mutate the data struct passed in to them. Rather, the funcs would return a <i>new</i> data struct that has the appropriate changes.<p>But that would generate a lot of &quot;allocations&quot; and &quot;garbage.&quot; Possibly that approach only makes sense in a language with a garbage collector. Presumably, the main reason you would have chosen Rust in the first place is you desired tight control over memory. Yet, this &quot;pure function&quot; approach which creates a lot of garbage requires you to not care so much about tight control over memory.<p>As I said, this is a guess -- where am I right and where am I wrong?",1399947123

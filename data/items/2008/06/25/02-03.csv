Everything I do.<p>I (along with many others) write lots of software to help small and midsize businesses compete more effectively.  They, in turn, provide value to their customers, jobs for their employees, and pay taxes to their communities.  If that's not a ""real, tangible, positive net effect on society"", I don't know what is.<p>Not everyone has to find a cure for disease or discover how to provide clean air and water for the masses.  You don't have to change the whole world, just a little piece of it.<p>A mentor once suggested I think of it like a football team.  Some pass, some catch, some run, some block, and some tackle.  All you have to do is ""your job"" well, for the team ""the rest of us"" to succeed.<p>Please don't be such an ""idealist"" that you never find your calling.

227107,comment,226400,226798,0,0,alabut,,,"I don't think ""voting permanency == more thought before voting"" is true for most people. I was saying it was true in my case and even so, it was a (relatively) long time before I noticed that unvoting was missing and that I still use votes as bookmarks, just less often than before. Plus it seems like an inefficient way to cut down on votes for bad links compared to being able to take back a mistaken vote.<p>More importantly, although I've reduced my usage of votes as bookmarking, I don't see why that's a good thing. The implied counter example is that if people could unvote, it would be a giant safety net and unleash a tidal wave of spurious votes, with people clicking on stories willy nilly because their actions were reversable. This doesn't sound true - more realistic scenarios are that there'd be a slight bump in votes overall or even a reduction of ""bad"" votes by allowing people to correct misclicks.<p>Thinking about my usage patterns, I bet a lot of people realize they can't take back their votes, use votes as bookmarks anyway and are simply annoyed at not being able to trim down their ""saved"" list by removing outdated/mistaken/irrelevant links. The lack of an undo feature doesn't change most people's actions unless they notice in advance that it's missing because the action they're about to perform is something really important, like paying for something or deleting their writing.<p>A big chunk of the problem may simply be the verbiage and language of the profile page. I can see how newish people (like myself) misunderstand voting for saving because votes are displayed as ""Saved: ##"" rather than ""Votes: ##"" instead. Saving implies bookmarking, as well as unsaving. Being able to ""unvote"" sounds unnatural, it sounds like what happened to Gore in Florida and nobody would expect to take back their participation in a poll. Whereas ""unsaving"" doesn't sound weird and is a routine operation.",1214361926

227088,comment,227006,227006,0,0,bporterfield,,,"I consistently see posts like this touting 'new web-app frameworks' and such, and always find a few important concepts about web apps mysteriously unmentioned:<p>1) Video.<p>Video on the web is king. Streaming video. Live video. Video comments. Video video video. None of these javascript-based solutions have an inherent solution for incorporating video into your web app, and therefore will always need to be augmented with a video technology for web-apps that require video.<p>2) Cross-browser compatibility<p>We're getting closer with javascript compatibility, but not there yet. Yes, many of these frameworks claim to hide the issue, but what about developers that want to develop components for the framework? A virtual machine that is consistent across all browsers (well, supported browsers) makes development much cleaner.<p>3) Flash IS Open-source.<p>Flash may not be truly 'open-source', but rarely is there a mention that Adobe has released the specifications for the specifications for both the .swf file format and the actionscript virtual machine, and are accepting feedback on both.<p>4) Rapid Development Environments<p>I admit to knowing little about how people are developing these apps in these languages, but doubt that the IDE's contain the feature-rich capabilities required for complex RIAs - things like code hinting across libraries, a walk-through debugger, visual drag & drop component interface, etc etc.<p>---<p>I am in no way suggesting that these new technologies are not exciting or an improvement - I just think the hype around them (<a href=""http://www.roughlydrafted.com/2008/06/14/cocoa-for-windows-flash-killer-sproutcore/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.roughlydrafted.com/2008/06/14/cocoa-for-windows-f...</a>) is somewhat unsubstantiated.

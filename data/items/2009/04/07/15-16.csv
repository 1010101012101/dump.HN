So far I have only two solutions which can actually completely eliminate the problem: rented small cars (preferably electric), and AI drivers. Having them together would be bliss.<p>And the second one isn't even as science fiction as is sounds. You can cheat in any way you want, as long as you get the job done. You can tell the AI the map of the city, down to traffic signs. Keep the AI in one place and drive remotely. Put cams all over the city (or better above the city), with cars' roofs painted with barcodes. Hell, you can probably simply drive remotely and it'd be enough of a killer app.",1239119943

Doing so requires manipulating the main thread's event queue when you're paused (so that Venkman itself responds), allowing new event handlers to fire and generally mucking up complicated situations.  For debugging simple web pages, Firebug has the same problems but a cleaner interface and fewer bugs.  For heavier XUL development, Venkman is the option option, but I would much prefer an out of process debugger capable of debugging threads (which I think is a js/jsd limitation).",1239119581

Tie each goal to percentage ownership. If goals are met, you vest. If goals are not met, you find another partner or scrap the project altogether.<p>Also make sure that the goals are on a somewhat concurrent timeline. ""Suits"" generally have trouble executing on a ""beta"" product so if you do not set concurrent goals, you will keep developing new features and never, ever have the chance to see your partner in action.<p>What I mean is, push really hard for a bare-bone set of requirements that you both agree to be ""good enough"" as the first iteration of your product, and as soon as that feature set is in place, your partner needs to execute (again, whatever's relevant to you - sell some subscriptions, get some marquee clients on board, raise capital, etc).<p>Good luck!",1239119432

I dropped out of college, spent the winter as a snowboard bum in Colorado, moved back to Boston, and started working for minimum wage in retail.  Managed to save enough money to buy a new computer.  Got a better job, rinse & repeat.  At no time was I subsidized by anyone else.  I also don't think I was ""very very lucky"".  Sure, I consider myself lucky in general, but the path from dropping out of college to success is all about hard work (and some natural aptitude wrt tech startup stuff).<p>I'd argue that if you have what it takes to create a successful tech startup (technical skills, strong drive/work ethic, determination, unhealthy willingness to work 16 hours a day, etc...) then you could do just fine dropping out of college.  If you don't have those things, then I'd say stay in college for sure, but you won't start a successful startup regardless.<p>I'm also not sure what you want people to ""fix"" in higher education.  I'm not saying it's perfect, but it sounds like you want EVERYONE to create startups.  No matter how amazing college is, most people simply don't the right set of traits for that, and that's 100% okay!  Society needs artists, call reps, grocery store managers, stay at home moms/dads, and everything else.

551074,comment,550801,550801,0,0,tc,,,"Dan Weinreb is a smart guy, but too many of these points seem like straw men, at least if the point of identifying problems with CL is to investigate the apparent lack of mainstream adoption.  Let's see:<p><i>Too many concepts; irregular</i><p>Yes, but unless you're implementing the language you can really almost ignore the concepts you don't like.  If you prefer property lists, then forget about alists if you want.  But really, a lisp in which you <i>couldn't</i> make an alist would seem awkward and irregular to me.<p><i>Hard to compile efficiently</i><p>I benchmark.  SBCL is <i>fast</i>.  It's much faster than it needs to be for mainstream adoption.  It knocks the socks off of perl, python, and ruby, for example.  For years it destroyed the JVM in performance, though I presume that the JVM has caught up somewhat by now.<p>And really, <i>any</i> language is hard to compile efficiently.  GCC has received tens of thousands of hours of optimization.  A naive C implementation would likely be slower than SBCL for real-world code.<p>At this point in history, we've even figured out how to implement ECMA JavaScript efficiently.<p><i>Too much memory</i><p>OK, I can agree with this.  All of us would like an implementation with a tree-shaker, for example.  But for production applications this isn't too much of a problem.  In 2009 you shouldn't still be using CGI calls.<p><i>Not portable</i><p>Java is 'portable' because there is one widely used implementation of the language.  Trying to port code from the JVM to GCJ is not straightforward.  Porting CL code that runs on Linux to BSD requires no work.  Porting from Linux to Windows requires no more work than would be expected in Perl, and probably less because CL makes an attempt at handling the pathname issues.<p><i>Archaic naming</i><p>Is this really a problem?  People who don't speak English seem able to learn programming languages in which all of the symbol name choices would seem meaningless initially.  And plenty of common English-like names don't actually map to their English equivalents: 'for' in C has almost no relation to 'for' in English, and even 'or', which in programming languages is always inclusive, is usually used exclusively in English.<p><i>Not uniformly object-oriented</i><p>On the rare occasion that I want to implement something like a new type of sequence, or arbitrary precision floating point numbers, I care about this.  The most common case though, is wanting to implement a new type of stream, which has already been fully handled by gray-streams, widely implemented on all CL implementations you would actually want to use.",1239118750

918947,comment,918605,918916,0,0,pedrocr,,,"From what I have seen about the UK system it is very much based on a cost-benefit tradeoff for treatments. Basically they do all the treatments that fit in the budget ordered by how many extra years of life expectancy each will add on average to the patient. Other countries have much less rational ways of going about it so it may very well be that on the specific case of cancer they are bellow standard just because the standard is irrationally high.<p>Statistics about life expectancy at birth put them at number 25 slightly above the EU average and the US. They are still bellow a bunch of other European countries and of course life expectancy is a function of more than the health service itself but also the habits of the population in terms of diet, exercise, etc.<p>Edit: According to this (random google search):<p><a href=""http://www.nationmaster.com/graph/hea_dea_fro_can-health-death-from-cancer"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nationmaster.com/graph/hea_dea_fro_can-health-dea...</a><p>The UK actually beats the US and most of Europe on the number of actual cancer deaths.

918930,comment,918605,918891,0,0,pedrocr,,,">You cite %change in GDP as a measure of economic growth in your third point, after claiming in your first and second points that GDP itself is not a good measure for quality of life/economic well being/etc, in points one and two. Does that make sense?<p>My first point was about disposable income which is a subset of GDP. My second one only said that high relative costs can just mean flat income structures independent of GDP (hence the two extreme cases of Portugal and the US with high and low GDPs both having low costs for pizza compared to Sweden. I never really argue that high GDP doesn't make you richer.<p>> I think you're letting your terminology run away from you in your first point. It's true that ""Disposable income"" doesn't need to cover educational, medical, and other social expenses in Scandinavian welfare states, but those expenses still have to be paid out of tax receipts.
I don't see how the Scandinavian governments can get $35000 per person in value out of $25000 per person in income.<p>I agree with you that the pure GDP comparison makes the disposable income point less important. But GDP by itself doesn't seem comparable either. If the Scandinavian population consumes on average more healthcare and education on a per-service not per-dollar basis than the US one, you can have a higher purchasing power just because you buy a higher percentage of Chinese goods produced with low wage costs instead of locally supplied healthcare and education delivered by higher-earning local wages (ever increasing since you are getting richer). But now I am way out of my league. IANAEconomist<p>All this discussion naturally forgets the next point of how much this added GDP/wealth actually drives happiness. From what I saw from Happiness research Europe has actually been obtaining gains in overall happiness while the US has stagnated. One theory was that productivity gains in Europe were used to reduce number of work hours while in the US they were used to increase GDP. Europe would be doing the better tradeoff as both were already at diminishing returns for money but time off had a good return. An interesting theory at least.",1257237755

No debate there.<p>- Compare private consumption between the US and Europe, specifically stating that it does not control for healthcare and education. From page 14:<p><i>Different countries’ choices of public commitment influence, through taxation policy, the scope available for private consumption, at the same time as high taxation countries, through their public sectors, offer some of the things recorded in low taxation countries as private consumption. There is no easy way of getting round this, but it is an important point to bear in mind when comparing private consumption.</i><p>- It does then compare retail consumption which shouldn't include any of these things and thus be more objective. That one still shows the US as higher than Sweden. Another table shows that US households have more home appliances. So on that count Americans do appear to be richer, assuming of course they are getting equal average amounts of education and healthcare on their private purchases as the Europeans are getting on their tax dollars. Otherwise you'd just be displacing money from healthcare and education into buying retail goods. An argument can surely be bade that this is in fact the case and that although the higher end healthcare and education in the US is top notch the average over the whole population is not as good as the average in Sweden. Anyone know of any good data on this?<p>I did notice however that the disposable income argument was made about countries within the EU based on another study. So it is possible that the public/private mix in the several EU nations actually doesn't favor Scandinavia in terms of efficiency.

Given the amount of money they should have spent on power systems, there's no reason this should happen. I've been to Savvis' facilities and they know <i>exactly</i> when a battery in their UPSes start to fail and how badly. Gensets get load tested regularly. Everything is fully redundant with instant failover. Yes, things can still go wrong, but they shouldn't be going wrong this often.",1257235816

I wish I was smart enough and grew up in a good enough background to aspire to be CEO at 16. The thing to know is to work hard to live up to the title and be a GREAT CEO.<p>One thing that I want to tell them is to keep their eyes open and explore new interests. I hated the idea of business because I thought it was evil, but college opened my eyes to the startup world because I kept an open-mind and tried out different things. Since then it's become a big part of my life and I love it. =)",1257235764
918883,comment,918590,918763,0,0,btilly,,,"The problem is that the tail wags the dog in California.<p>The California Constitution requires a 2/3 majority to pass the budget.  The demographics of the state virtually guarantee a 60-40 split between Democrats and Republicans.  It is virtually impossible to get any Republican to vote for a tax increase.  Ever.  It is hard to get Democrats to accept cuts to social programs.<p>This is a guaranteed mess and the budget process is therefore painfully difficult.  Unfortunately the Republicans are so good on party unity that in the end the Democrats, despite their significant majority, wind up compromising far more.<p>To add to this mess, the voters can and do pass any measures they like through the referendum process with a simple majority vote.  Once the voter initiatives have reduced taxes (prop 13 is a famous example) or mandated spending (prop 98 for instance), the legislature has to work around the resulting restrictions.  Based on their votes, California voters have been pretty much oblivious to the effects of their decisions.<p>Ain't democracy wonderful?",1257235723

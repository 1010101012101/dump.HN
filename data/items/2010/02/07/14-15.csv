Didn't Adobe issue a DMCA takedown when someone implemented RTMP?<p>Here's a copy of what appears to be the takedown notice: <a href=""http://www.chillingeffects.org/anticircumvention/notice.cgi?NoticeID=25159"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.chillingeffects.org/anticircumvention/notice.cgi?...</a><p>I recognize that that the takedown notice says it was issued because the implementation ""can be used to download copyrighted works,"" not because it's an implementation of RTMP. That's a silly argument-- every web browser that uses a Flash player downloads content before it plays it. How could one implement RTMP, the ""Real-Time Messaging Protocol"" without sending any messages?<p>I'm willing to believe that there might be some misunderstanding here-- maybe there are two parts to the RTMP spec, and only one is open, or something like that.

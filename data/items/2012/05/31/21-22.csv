Practical is writing code, running wire, and testing the car. Surely they've done both, but now that the car exists they're into the practical territory. As they adventure through the practical part, surely new theoreticals are discovered and published.<p>Just because nobody has built a self-driving car before does not automatically make actually building one a theoretical exercise.

For one, you don't give up equity for Kickstarter funding.<p>In general, regardless of how much funding one might have, one would also like to have the maximum dollar value of sales possible. Kickstarter facilitates this both by enabling sales-like revenue in the first place, and by enabling price discrimination. I'd need to learn more about the Kickstarter funding mechanism to understand whether the sales analogy is totally appropriate or just partially so, but it seems to me to be the far better analogy when compared to venture funding.",1338501369

I don't mean that as intentionally mean, but again, this is the 'business model' that's worked for them for years, and apparently the same business model that hasn't worked for you.<p>Could they be doing it better?  Sure. There's always room for improvement, but they deliver a quality product.  In return for that, they occasionally solicit for donations.  It's quite possible that they do all the things you've suggested.  It's quite possible that they ordinarily run at a surplus, but haven't been raising actively, or haven't been receiving donations.  It's possible that they've already sent an email to their user base and gotten a less-than-ideal response.<p>They're moving data centers, so it's possible that they ate up some of that surplus in the migration effort, which tends to get costly.<p>Either way, I don't personally see this as begging, and they've already hit their goal, which should help to reinforce how valuable the service is.

What's encouraging is that the advice has gone over the heads of the majority of commenters here, and no matter how hard he tries, his advice on A/B testing doesn't seem to be catching on at large.<p>I don't have a product to sell (I'm working on it!), but I've found a fantastic way to monetize patio11s free advice. The money I've made (and saved) by doing this will feed and clothe my unborn child, ETA November.<p>1. Read everything he writes about helping people make money. Automating SEO, split testing and now email marketing (<a href=""http://startupbook.net"" rel=""nofollow"">http://startupbook.net</a> by Rob Walling is also mostly about email marketing).<p>2. Use that advice to help people make money. You can do this at work, or with your freelance clients (neither will mind you trying to help them make more money). Rather than theorize about whether his advice works or not, actually try and see if it moves the right needles. You will be pleasantly surprised.<p>3. Read the stuff he writes about consulting and having the confidence to charge higher fees. Then go be a consultant and start charging high fees for the advice that you got from patio11.<p>You may feel bad about taking patio11s advice and selling it for a daily rate. I did. So I send all clients that I talk to about implementing basic split tests links to pertinent blog posts on his website. To date, not one has shown signs of reading them.<p>They're a great deal more excited when I install visual website optimizer and a full 20% more people click through when we change button copy from ""Start Here"" to ""Get Your Widget"".<p>Somewhat relevant anecdote: I've recently been working with a client that implements many of of the tactics and techniques that patio11 describes for making more money. This client happens to be richer than Croesus. Their process is centred around conversion (i.e. <i>conversion parity</i> on a 10% sample is a post-QA requirement for rolling out new site functionality). They have entire departments with 10+ employees dedicated to SEO + Content, Email Marketing and PPC.<p>Every month, they get richer than Croesus with a higher conversion rate.

I wont say I regret it, because the last 5-6 years of being partner in a startup and earning a good pay-check have been fun. But I very much do regret not being able to completely grasp all the new interesting research papers that are coming out. Nothing is more frustrating than reading a research paper, and knowing enough to be able to grasp that this algorithm could improve some part of your system, but then being unable to decipher/implement it, because one have forgotten(or not learned) parts of the mathematical notation/background. In other words being able to see the solution, but the solution being juuust out of your grasp. I hope down the road to be able to compensate for this problem by hiring smarter guys than myself that DID finish their CS degree :)<p>Also another benefit of studying CS is that around year 2-3 you will be introduced to some subject matter that I at least personally am pretty sure I would never have heard of otherwise.

I&#x27;m happy to believe that djb can come up with secure elliptic curves, but I&#x27;m under no delusions that reading all his papers and coming up with my own elliptic curves is in any way a good idea. Similarly, even if I take the djb way of software writing to heart, I don&#x27;t see a reason to believe that <i>I</i> could write software with qmail&#x27;s level of robustness. I am just not a world-class expert the way that he is.<p>seL4, meanwhile, has a formal model of the C programming language in the proof assistant Isabelle/HOL, a formal model of what they want their C codebase to do (and not do), and a formal proof that, in fact, their C codebase has the properties they hope that it has. The C is handwritten, but it may as well not be; you can&#x27;t do feature additions, significant refactoring, etc. to the C without needing to replicate those all in a language that is completely unlike C.<p>If these are the best arguments in favor of writing secure software in C, you don&#x27;t really need any counterarguments....",1441177184

No crazy 3D &quot;inside the computer&quot; visuals like in Hackers or most other movies and television programs about this stuff.<p>The Gnome vs. KDE bit was a nice touch. As soon as that scene was over, I was already thinking &quot;I&#x27;m probably going to like this show&quot;.

If you have some files on your laptop that are super important, you probably shouldn&#x27;t `rm -rf` them 1.5 seconds after uploading to your NAS.<p>There is nothing ridiculous about a hard drive breaking between backups. There are situations where loosing all data after latest backup would be, if not unrecoverable, at least extremely irritating. Having redundant drives in a laptop might not be feasible, but dedicated workstations are still used in many places.<p>> If you really are going to immediately purge some critical data from its source location 1.5 seconds after fsyncing to your drive, you should be sending it to multiple locations and waiting for confirmation containing a valid checksum before considering the write a success.<p>Which is exactly what ZFS/btrfs in a mirrored RAID configuration does.",1441173750

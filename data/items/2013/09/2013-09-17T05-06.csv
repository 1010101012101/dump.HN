It&#x27;s to work against inflation and maintain financial security / independence, it&#x27;s to prepare for potential catastrophes, and it&#x27;s also to prepare for your declining years.<p>Actuarial tables show if you make it to age 40 you have a very high likelihood of making it to 80 or 90. Statistics show that the last decade of your life - thanks to health care needs or assisted living necessities - is often more expensive than any other decade of your life.<p>That&#x27;s absolutely important to plan for in your 20&#x27;s and 30&#x27;s when you have the time (and energy) to make a difference.",1379397561

6397829,comment,6394386,6396653,1,0,andrewflnr,,,"Right, an ordering relation on the edge objects. <i>facepalm</i> That should have been obvious, but I usually think about trees in terms of vectors of children, not traditional graph theory.<p>I like trees too. I think that as long as computer memory is linear, our serializations are going to be linear, so even when we get holographic displays, our primary abstractions should be linearly serializable (so we don&#x27;t get lost in leaky abstractions), which means trees. A graph structure built on that would have to be some form of &quot;magic&quot; layered on top, based on links embedded in the tree. Among other possibilities, you can make the &quot;edges&quot; be little independent trees that link to the &quot;nodes&quot;.",1379397484

Well quite frankly, it is an area that still needs work and given how many aspiring tech founders are on HN, it is an excellent place to reiterate such a point.<p>Personal anecdote if you care to read: My roommate and I launched a mobile app a little over a year ago on our campus and it didn&#x27;t do as well as we wanted. Sure, the app wasn&#x27;t as refined as it could have been but we still expected far more users. Looking back, one thing we never did was reach out to our initial users and ask for feedback. This time around, just last week, we launched the same service but in the form of a website (alwaysbuzzn.com) and have reached out to almost every one of our initial users to ask for their genuine feedback. Not only has it helped us iterate, but it has shown our users that we care about what they think and the word is spreading faster than ever. Sure, we can say the website is more effective than the app, but I still point our success to our attention to maximizing the user experience beyond anything else.",1379397160

6397808,comment,6396352,6397514,2,0,BrandonMarc,,,"Hear hear. I can&#x27;t repeat this point enough. You have to force yourself to save, first. If you spend on everything else first and figure you&#x27;ll save &quot;the rest&quot;, something will always come up. If you set it aside before other categories, it will ... be set aside!<p>As a corollary, just writing (and following) a basic budget does wonders. I&#x27;ve talked to a lot of people who said it was like getting a raise. You have regular expenses, so just plan out a basic month and then follow it. Something magic happens next: by being more conscious and deliberate about your spending, you spend less on un-necessary &quot;wants&quot; (if it&#x27;s truly a need you&#x27;ll spend it no matter what).<p>Plus, a written budget is like looking in the mirror: it&#x27;s a reflection of your priorities, good bad or indifferent. If you see you&#x27;re spending $300 / month on restaurants and $0 / month saving for retirement ... well, that shows what appears to be important to you. And, if you&#x27;ve got two brain cells to rub together, it shows an easy place to make some adjustments. Not that I have anything against restaurants ... even $200 and $100 would be far more reasonable.",1379397131

I&#x27;ve seen adventure games, roleplaying games, one Diablo-like, a roguelike or two, and plenty of strategy/tactics games (marking a strong comeback of turn-by-turn play). On the other hand, there seems to be a dearth of manshooters/interactive torture games (apart from a tactical one I read about not so long ago) - either because the public is already well served by Medal of Duty XXIX or due to budget constraints.

The problem is not that poor people are constantly choosing to be poor, or making no choice and allowing themselves to fall into poverty, but that they are raised in poverty. Being raised poor means all sorts of things: you are taught poor values by your parents, you likely get a terrible education, you likely only have access to be friends with fellow poor people, you probably eat poorly, and worst of all your poor parents and poor friends have reinforced your entire life that these poor decisions you&#x27;re making are actually good decisions.<p>You will never accomplish anything (or sound smart or practical at all) by slapping individuals in the face and telling them to make better decisions. They&#x27;re told that these good decisions us well off people make, by their friends and by the vast majority of us well-offers, are actually making us terribly unhappy people (and in a lot of cases they&#x27;re not wrong). The only way real change can happen is by addressing the cultural cycle of poverty, and by supporting, positively teaching, and motivating these people to make better decisions.",1379396037

There <i>are</i> some specialized modules, but stroke studies have shown that massive damage to specific functions can often be recovered by retraining. It seems that particular parts of the brain are especially good at learning particular jobs, and that when they learn a job they somehow suppress redundant learning by other regions. Much of the apparent specialization of the brain is very possibly an optimization process, akin to a computer cluster that automatically assigns I/O jobs to nodes near the mass storage.",1379394762

6397674,comment,6396852,6396852,1,0,merciBien,,,"I assume you mean QA Analyst, as opposed to QA Engineer. To me the main difference is that QA Analysts don&#x27;t write code, where QA Engineers do write code. If you enjoy writing code, you should try for a QA Engineering position.<p>I was a Quality Assurance Analyst at a large financial services company for a few years. I can&#x27;t say how different a gaming or analytics company would be, but I think most large software companies will be similar. Personally, I&#x27;d stay away from QA positions at large companies, as I found I was trapped in a specialized testing area that limited my ability to learn new skills.<p>QA&#x27;s need good analytical skills, to know where to look for bugs, and judgement to know how severe a defect is. Good communication skills, particularly writing skills are critical. By writing skills I mean the ability to write clear descriptions for developers, and clear steps for them to reproduce issues. I ask specific questions in interviews to find out if a candidate for a QA position can clearly explain a 5 step process.<p>QA&#x27;s typically write short descriptions of their test strategy for the code they&#x27;re testing and discuss the plan with the developer who wrote the code and other QA&#x27;s. It&#x27;s better when these docs are clear and understandable. Non-agile teams usually require QA&#x27;s to write documents listing all of the tests they plan to run, even if they never check that you actually run them. Agile teams usually eliminate this kind of busy work.<p>As a QA I spent a lot of time explaining the app and functionality to the rest of the company, including managers, directors and VP&#x27;s.<p>QA&#x27;s need good soft skills, they need to learn about other parts of the business to understand the customer the company&#x27;s trying to reach. Often the design given to developers is missing requirements, a good QA can find those requirements early and save the team time reworking code later. Often QA&#x27;s need to coordinate testing with other QA teams, integration points are where software always breaks!<p>QA Analysts on my team spend the majority of their time either running manual tests, or using software that permits them to automate my company&#x27;s application. We have a team of automation engineers, Quality Engineers officially, who write and maintain tools and testing frameworks that allow non-engineers to create automated tests. Our automation team wrote a scripting language for Selenium WebDriver to permit easier automation of browser controls.<p>Since my company&#x27;s application is a web app, many of the tools they use allow viewing and tweaking web requests. Here&#x27;s some tools the QA&#x27;s use daily:<p><i>HTTP Analyzers and Javascript consoles</i><p>* Chrome and Safari Developer Tools<p>* IE HTTP Analyzer<p>* Firebug<p><i>Monitoring Software</i><p>* Computer Associates APM (Server Monitoring)<p>* Splunk (Log Monitoring)<p><i>Test Case Management</i><p>* SilkCentral (I hated this app, slow and inflexible)<p>* Microsoft Excel (for writing tests)<p><i>Agile Management/Bug Tracking</i><p>* Rally or Jira<p>The QA&#x27;s on my team who could manipulate the Linux command \nline, create simple Bash scripts managed deployments to QA and Performance environments, and tested some of the application&#x27;s backend components.<p>I took programming classes at night, and as quickly as I could I found a QA Engineering position at the same company. Since I had little programming experience, my experience as a QA Analyst was key to getting a QA Engineer position. A QA Engineer with a solid understanding of what and where to test is very valuable to any company.<p>If you don&#x27;t want to code, Quality Analysts often move to Program Management, or become Scrum Masters or people managers.<p>You didn&#x27;t say if you&#x27;re applying for a Quality Analyst position. If you are, Good luck!:)<p>edit: cleaned up formatting",1379394373

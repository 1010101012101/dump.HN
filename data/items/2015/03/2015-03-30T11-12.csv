9288863,comment,9288021,9288475,0,0,IkmoIkmo,,,"Mostly as the world&#x27;s factory, I would add. For all the criticism of China&#x27;s environmental standard we tend to fail to mention that we procure many of the products that are built in unsustainable ways, largely unwilling to pay a premium to make it more sustainable. Add to that the apples/oranges comparison where hundreds of millions of people in China live in 1800s industrial-revolutionesque environments, it&#x27;s hardly fair to hold them to a standard of modern, efficient, sustainable 21st century production processes we find in many OECD countries today.<p>Anyway, I don&#x27;t mean for this to be a giant cop-out for China. But its environmental record should be contextualized. An interesting part of that context is that it&#x27;s one of the most rapidly advancing countries in terms of investments and capacity of sustainable energy. Policy makers definitely do not look the other way and ignore the problems as if they don&#x27;t exist. It appears the environmental issues are acknowledged, but not always prioritized over trying to lift hundreds of millions of people into a lower-middle class from de facto poverty.<p>One may be more sympathetic to that than some of the global-warming denier policy makers we see in the west, who are either ignorant of the problem or prioritize economic goals while the average American or European already makes 10x more than the average Chinese. (who, again, use a significant chunk of this money to move their CO2 production out of the country, and to China, benefiting from the production but offloading the CO2 onto China&#x27;s record, and in the process moving any affects of local pollution onto relatively poor Chinese. If it&#x27;s waste, we call it toxic dumping and outlaw it. If it&#x27;s air and water pollution from a factory that creates jobs, it&#x27;s but an unfortunate side effect of globalism).<p>At least, that&#x27;s the Chinese&#x27;s perspective. There&#x27;s more to it, but I think it&#x27;s important to be aware of the above in any case.",1427716250

For the later, some very important capabilities of C++ rely on operator overloading namely the assignment operator (copy/move assignment) and the function operator (allows what C++ calls functors). Another useful thing with operator overloading is allowing the creation of generic functions that work on existing types (int, float, ..) and user defined types, for example std::accumulate.",1427715585

For a few weeks, as a precaution, I avoided giving my children rice to eat (and I&#x27;m sure I wasn&#x27;t the only one) and getting into a fairly heated argument with my spouse about it, who thought I was crazy.

As, in steady state (as you are assuming), all memory freed will be reused, and (effectively) all memory used will be written to at least once, and memory used by a group of objects is at least O(n) w.r.t. the number of objects.<p>So no, I don&#x27;t see the advantage you say. I see that, in the <i>best</i> case, it&#x27;s on par with non-GC&#x27;d systems, asymptotically speaking.<p>And yet, I see plenty of disadvantages. To start:<p>I have yet to see a GC that&#x27;s O(1) w.r.t. the amount of memory to free. Best case? I&#x27;ll grant you that, for an extremely naive copying collector. But the chance of that best case occurring is... not significant. Especially with the more sophisticated algorithms.<p>And again, as above, it doesn&#x27;t matter how long it takes to free memory. As long as it&#x27;s linear or sublinear, it&#x27;ll be dominated, asymptotically speaking, by how long it takes to initialize that memory again. And in steady-state operation it will be reinitialized.<p>Not to mention the practical effects.<p>For instance: GC thrashes cache. Badly. It completely kills the concept of a working set. You can&#x27;t work around that by making your heap larger - if anything it makes it worse. It makes the time period between thrashings longer, yes, but makes them worse when it does happen.<p>GC also doesn&#x27;t scale well to large numbers of cores. In particular, your worst case &quot;always&quot; will be when the GC has to check with every core to see if it still has a reference to something. And given that processor numbers are where most of the performance improvements seem to be coming in... You mentioned memory size improvements but didn&#x27;t mention increasing numbers of cores.<p>GC also (almost always) has field(s) per object. Minimum of O(1) overhead per object initialized.<p>Which means that, generally speaking, the overhead doesn&#x27;t asymptote to zero.

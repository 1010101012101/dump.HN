Such specialization is not going to cut it going forward.  We have to view learning as a life-long continuous endeavour of an experimentation of ideas.<p>Start by making university free.  Pay people to study.  Don&#x27;t let young people go 30K+ in debt just to get a basic education.  That load of debt starting out limits possibilities.  Mostly limiting the ability to be creative or entrepreneurial but it can also hinder one&#x27;s ability to be mobile and to travel and acquire new perspectives.",1372078695

5932563,comment,5932351,5932351,1,0,gexla,,,"There are a lot of weak points in this article.<p>> And during my recent sojourns Ive noticed one thing: the Chinese are here. There. And everywhere. The point was rammed home when I visited the Darling Hotel in Sydney, a lavish new casino complex where 95 per cent of the guests are Chinese.<p>Right, Australia is in China&#x27;s back yard relative to the U.S. Actually, there are a lot of interesting touristy places you can easily access from China. Easily accessible from the U.S. is Canada, Mexico, islands off the East coast, South America and other U.S. states. Most of that list isn&#x27;t as interesting as the same list I could come up with for China.<p>The U.S. has always been a relatively isolated big power. That&#x27;s partly what helped become a super power in the first place. We haven&#x27;t had much to worry about for invasions. We also have our different culture and places we like to visit. We only get two weeks of vacation per year anyways, we don&#x27;t want to be spending half that short vacation time in the air. You will find us in easy to reach (for us) and relatively easy locations to figure out. That means we spend a lot of our vacation time in the U.S. and countries which have a lot of English speakers (that&#x27;s the only language we speak!)<p>We have had our time of great growth. If we were to go through as much steel and other construction materials as China right now, our country would be a mess. It&#x27;s already well enough industrialized. We need to shrink our suburbs and fix what we already have rather than building a bunch of new stuff.<p>As an American living in the Philippines, I don&#x27;t believe in some sort of fall of the West and a rise of the East. Right now the Philippines Peso is falling like crazy because the Fed has signaled that QE is about to end. When the big economies of the West flood their markets with money, then big flows end up heading to emerging markets in Asia. The flow doesn&#x27;t even have to be big, a drop in the bucket in the U.S. does a lot in an emerging economy.<p>And aren&#x27;t we past the talk of an X century? What will the next century look like? We could be talking about the Mars century by then!",1372078649

Its sad to see all electronic music get lumped into &quot;edm.&quot;<p>This is an observation from where I stand: EDM as a trend looks to the underground dance music-sphere and plucks ideas. Right now Deep/Minimal House has begun to enter the EDM world. All things considered this is an established sound that has been around for a long time. Now, its &quot;new&quot; and &quot;innovative.&quot; Of course, it only counts as new if a current &quot;EDM&quot; dj is producing the track.<p>I have no moral judgement. But, it is an interesting trend. Dance music evolves fast! EDM has sped up the process, they take a popular trend, only a few year old, re-shape to please the masses, and create a movement to backlash to.<p>Right now techno is huge, in the dance music world. I expect EDM to jump on it not too long from now.",1372078519

The President and Congress are simply limited by the finite amount of time they have, and it&#x27;s about time that we realize that the size of the United States as a population and as a governing body has outgrown the framework designed just a few centuries ago.<p>Sure, we could expect that someone from the NSA would brief the President or congress on the happenings of surveillance. It <i>seems</i> like a huge priority. But I lean towards Hanlon&#x27;s Razor and thus towards believing that there are multiple layers of people between the people who make these decisions and the President--layers of people who are balancing their job security (after all, who would hire someone fired from the NSA for overstepping the 4th amendment) and their job description (after all, who do we blame when terrorist attack?).

Whatever we do to stop terrorism is worth the price we pay. (These folks also tend to believe in other issues as trumping everything else) Most of these folks are plugged into the establishment in some way -- military, legislative, security, and now reporters. For these guys, Snowden is the enemy. The story here is all about him and how we&#x27;re going to &quot;get him&quot;<p>The other group of people are technically-inclined folks and, well, libertarian-type weirdos (And I say that as a little-l libertarian). We view the enemy as the ideology that enough is never enough: the enemy is the thought that we should continue collecting and collating data on each American citizen (and the rest of the world) until we have perfect knowledge about everybody. For them, the story is the disaster the first group has created out of the country. Snowden is just an example, a very small piece of a very big story.<p>80% of folks, however, could care less, as long as Farmville keeps working. What we&#x27;re seeing in the press is this battle between insiders like Gregory and outsiders like Greenwald for control over the narrative. Is this going to be just another &quot;bad guy on the run&quot; story? Or will it actually have an impact on public opinion?<p>Short run, I&#x27;m not optimistic the 80% are going to see the minutely-studied drones that BigCorp and BigGov are turning them into. But these things have a way of building on each other. The smart move for government here, if it wants to remain legitimate, is to make some major concessions right now while keeping important capabilities intact. It&#x27;s not an &quot;us or them&quot; posture. But that seems to be what we&#x27;re going to get.<p>I just wish the focus would get off of Snowden and Greenwald.

Somehow, when DJs playing other people&#x27;s records achieved stardom, people started expecting them to release their own tracks, too. Some were good at it, but some weren&#x27;t, so they hired someone else to help.<p>It isn&#x27;t a very big problem, really, in my opinion. Most dance music fans can pick out the good from the bad anytime. An artist who consistently produces good records (acts like deadmau5, laurent garnier, and, yes, skrillex, come to mind, but there&#x27;s a gazillion more) probably has control over what goes on in the studio. Ibiza deejays who have a dance chart hit or two, well, not so sure.<p>In fact, the amazement is a good thing. It means we expect dance producers to be original, the real thing. In other genres, most notably pop, we all expect the writing and composing and arrangement and everything else except the singing to have been done by anonymous, behind-the-scenes people.<p>As an example I was more amazed to discover that Take That actually write their own songs, than to find out that Afrojack hired a studio guy.<p>ps. As an interesting aside, great reading material is &quot;The Manual&quot; by the KLF[1]. Written in 1988, a big part of it is about how to get hired studio engineers and programmers to basically produce your hit record for you, without any necessary talent from your side.

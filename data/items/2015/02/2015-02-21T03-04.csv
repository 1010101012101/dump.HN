He was the quintessential &quot;close to the troops&quot; manager, he chatted with all pupils regularly, cornering them in the yard or the street to ask them their thoughts, and occasionally barging into a maths class and teaching it (incredibly well). When he retired and wanted to spend a bit of time teaching disadvantaged kids in state-run schools, his application was rejected by the government because he did not hold the appropriate teaching qualification.

For example, I generally eat new programming languages for breakfast (or bedtime reading, really).<p>But I&#x27;ve noticed that Haskell isn&#x27;t like picking up the PL flavor-of-the-week.  Instead, it feels much more like learning a new area of mathematics.  It&#x27;s common with a novel area of math to just have to bang your head on it for a while.  If you hang on through that phase, the cognitive switch flips and then you wonder how it was ever difficult.  So it goes with a language that feels much closer to math reified, and for which most of the patterns we&#x27;re used to from our imperative platform experiences just don&#x27;t apply.<p>One good piece of advice I&#x27;ve seen a few places is to work through the U. Penn CIS 194 lectures and homeworks[1].  The lecture notes refer to other good resources for reading, including chapters of <a href=""http://learnyouahaskell.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://learnyouahaskell.com/</a> and more.

I know this stuff already?&quot;  But you&#x27;ll probably get stuck at places, and those places pinpoint precisely the missing foundation blocks you&#x27;ll need to reason successfully about your Haskell programs.

No external dependencies is better all around.<p>> but the problem is more that it requires cgo at all.<p>You&#x27;ll always be using CGO to make C calls, which OpenGL is.<p>> One or two years ago I tried to use a package (I can&#x27;t remember the name of and I&#x27;m at work) which was pure go for GL bindings, generated from the OpenGL specs, but it lacked a few wrappings and boxings here and there, making some calls particularly ugly and really not trivial, so I fell back to go-gl/gl (which requires glew).<p>You&#x27;d be talking about Glow, most likely. For which the document outlines, is replacing go-gl/gl. It&#x27;s gotten a lot nicer and works much better.<p>> Of course you still need to link with something (such as glfw) that pops up a window, but that&#x27;s one thing less to achieve cross-compilation. BTW with recent Go it works fine when built as a dylib, it&#x27;s just tougher to distribute (on OS X at least, due to stored paths).<p>You don&#x27;t have to deal _at all anymore_ after this change! =) The Go tool builds the C sources directly, as it would Go source files. No external library installation needed: it&#x27;s included.<p>> From a more general dependency management PoV, I&#x27;m a bit anxious about how this is handled though, as this sets an uneasy precedent. &quot;Forcing&quot; the change is unwelcome this way as it significantly breaks the compatibility promise. Short of solutions like semantic versioning dependency management systems, the Go community has been idiomatically handling such incompatibilities at the library name level (foo, foo2, foo3 or bar.v1, bar.v2, bar.v3, or straight up another name). When handling such situations I&#x27;d rather have deprecation warnings on the README and when calling the code, pointing people to the new location, but keeping my current code working.<p>I promise you personally that we are fully aware of the issues and breaking backwards compatibility with this change. For that exact reason we&#x27;ve announced it loud and clear.<p>Myself and many other people whom I consider very smart were involved in this decision, which was not taken lightly. We chose what we believe to be the best path: breaking compatibility today, for a future where we will likely never have to again.<p>I enjoyed reading your thoughts, and I think this will do you a lot of good should you try using the packages again =)",1424489521

I definitely concede that there&#x27;s a reason the market looks the way it does, and that it&#x27;s not economically feasible to run a consultancy on gigs below a certain threshold, whether you&#x27;re shelling out for Aeron chairs and massages or no.<p>We do call it a consultancy, and some clients certainly come in that centralized way, but it&#x27;s also a resource for freelancers. Freelancers already have their own dealflow. We want to enable them to do more my offloading to folks they trust, not make them into de facto employees of some management team. That team is as small as it can be to keep things running, and in addition to hourly rates it&#x27;s supported by the same commission that any job referrer would get for bringing in jobs.<p>For example, management right now consists mostly of me. Most of my income comes from coding on projects. But if a new job comes in through &#x27;official&#x27; co-op channels managed by me, and I spend time screening & onboarding the client, I bill the co-op for that time.<p>With no office, no fulltime employees, and nobody who doesn&#x27;t have billable hours, there&#x27;s not a lot of overhead to worry about. The trick is keeping client experience and quality high while doing that, which isn&#x27;t too terribly hard when you only have experienced, successful freelancers on board.",1424488204

I mean, ostensibly you can do a lot as a citizen, however most of those actions have long term effects and thus are not as useful as a release valve. It involves commitment and even sacrifice, whereas blaming a corporation (however righ you might be) is much more immediate and serves the purpose of having someone to blame for that and lots of other stuff, i.e. you can then blame the general state of IT security, then how the govt does nothing about it, how privay is nowadays non-existent, think of the children, etc.<p>I also believe another factor is the way news have found a way to tap into this need for the audience to have a release valve. Something or someone to be angry at and so all your problems can be channeled to that. Where I live I&#x27;ve seen a growing amount of newspapers and news media that just basically do a certain journalism that does not bring anything to the table but things to be raging about.<p>I guess it&#x27;s easier to sell stuff when you can easily get people &quot;on your side&quot;, and since there&#x27;s always a lot of people angry at something, it becomes easy to have an audience.<p>So what&#x27;s the point then (from the POV of the media) of bringing &quot;important&quot; (for different values of important) news to the front page when that would require their audience to commit to actions that would last several years (change your country&#x27;s politics for example) and thus not as easily enticed to &quot;get on your side&quot; (and thus buy your media), if on the other hand you could bring, I guess you could call them &quot;anger-bait&quot; (like click-bait) news, and have everyone talk about it by virtue of functioning as an escape valve where people relieve their stress, fear, anger, etc?<p>I&#x27;m not saying it&#x27;s a good thing, but I&#x27;ve seen more and more evidence that points in this direction, and I guess that would be my answer as to why one has much more attention than the other.<p>Edit:<p>As an analogy, I read somewhere about the recent Charlie Hebdo (sp?) attack and how it got disproportionate attention vs the two thousand killed by ISIS (I believe it was ISIS... or Borok Haram?).

Withdrawal syndrome is a minor component in any real addition and is nothing without craving for the substance which is not present with SSRIs. As someone who has experienced both reasonably severe SSRI withdrawal and nicotine addiction I find your comparison ridiculous (no exp with opiates, but it seems safe to assume they aren&#x27;t better than nicotine).<p>The issue is the way your body normalizes to the new default of higher Serotonin levels - when you suddenly return to normal the present state is worse than the it was before you started taking SSRI&#x27;s (I read a few good papers on the topic a while ago, but I don&#x27;t remember their titles now - wikipedia is probably a good place to start: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antidepressant_discontinuation_syndrome"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antidepressant_discontinuation_...</a>).<p>Also lack of craving is a ridiculous justification for effectively prescribing substance abuse - for example aderol et. all are amphetamine salts - that people don&#x27;t have a craving in the sense that they would for cocaine is just because the high lacks the euphoric effect -- they still can&#x27;t function normally without dosing -- and it definitely doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;s fucking reasonable to prescribe to seven-year-olds.<p>Likewise people have cravings to watch their favorite tv-show or check their Facebook accounts - these cravings do not qualify these activities as substance abuse.",1429786601

People do not choose ambition over relationships, or vice-versa.<p>These terms are much more abstract than people think. The underlying denominator should be purpose, or rather definiteness of purpose. What I mean by that is, the arbiter of whether you should invest resources in your &#x27;ambition&#x27; or your &#x27;relationships&#x27; is the purpose with which you choose to live. If my self-determination and calling is to colonize mars and build self-driving cars to better humanity, I will position myself to do so, be it through relationships or allocation of other resources.<p>The problem is most people do not have a purpose, ambition can be interpreted both ways, as with everything. If I am defined by egotism and vanity, I might do almost anything I can to feed my vices, whether by buying cars, houses or spending money poorly. People would characterize me as ambitious, and they would be right, but it would be irrelevant, my purpose is built on a flawed foundation, a psychological need to prove myself to others.<p>TL;DR: We shouldn&#x27;t be comparing terms without considering the purpose through which we choose our everyday actions.",1429785891

9425825,comment,9425316,9425316,0,0,jasode,,,"Some extra thoughts the article doesn&#x27;t address...<p>1) the &quot;ambition&quot; may be deeply rooted in a person&#x27;s genetics if it&#x27;s connected to unchangeable personality traits like novelty seeking[1].  It would be a general feeling of wanderlust and/or wanting to make a change in the world.  (e.g. The older brother Ron in the article.)<p>This would be contrasted with someone who has a genetic 
disposition that prefers routine and familiarity. The visible effects we&#x27;d notice would be the person&#x27;s need for long and stable relationships, and living in close proximity to his/her childhood home.  (e.g. The sister Ruthie in the article.)<p>2) The &quot;quality&quot; of friends people are likely to encounter.  Depending on the circumstances (e.g. living in Los Angeles), people can accumulate &quot;friends&quot; but those colleagues from work, fellow church members, etc are not necessarily free of materialism like the Amish neighbors or the Dali Lama.  If one is living in Los Angeles, it may be hard to acquire genuine friends who are not plastic.  When a difficult life event happens (like losing a job), many so-called &quot;friends&quot; will disappear.  When you&#x27;re hot, everybody wants to know you; when you&#x27;re not, nobody returns your calls.  It&#x27;s not like the close-knit community of friends the article talks about.<p>3) a combination of the genetic disposition for restlessness and a society structure that often defaults to shallow friends, is it possible <i>for some types of individuals</i> for the correct advice to be turned on its head:  &quot;<i>Ambition is more important than relationships.</i>&quot;<p>Think of the mother who has a child (probably the most important &quot;relationship&quot; to nurture) but she is constantly resentful that parenting is blocking the life she could have had (actress, opera singer, etc).  Or the adult son that stays in his small town home caring for his sick mother but harbors resentment over missing out on exciting opportunities in London/Manhattan.  It&#x27;s the whole &quot;<i>I could&#x27;ve been a contender!</i>&quot; sentiment.  The mother may have been happier getting her tubes tied and pursuing her dreams.  The son may have been happier finding other care giving arrangements for his elderly mother instead of being enslaved by a constant guilt trip.<p>For those folks, relationships are still important but it&#x27;s the relationships that are a consequence of their ambitions that actually become meaningful.<p>[1]<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novelty_seeking#Genetics"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novelty_seeking#Genetics</a><p>[2]<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensation_seeking"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensation_seeking</a><p>[3]<a href=""http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ICouldaBeenAContender"" rel=""nofollow"">http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ICouldaBeenAConte...</a>",1429785760

For example: most vexing parse, integer promotions, conflated language features (classes provide records, polymorphism, namespacing, encapsulation), header files, vector<bool>, the grammar is insanely complicated, et cetera.  C++, like Common Lisp, is a standards effort which places more value on preserving the ability to run existing code than it does on removing language warts.  Tools are now appearing like clang-format, clang-modernize, ReSharper, etc., but the equivalent tools have been available for other languages for quite some time now because those languages don&#x27;t have the same complexity just at the syntactic level that C++ does.  For example, Python has &quot;2to3&quot;, and this was made with far fewer resources than &quot;clang-modernize&quot;.  Sure, C++ has richer semantics.  But the syntax really is a maze, and if it weren&#x27;t, we could have had our tools longer ago.",1429784759

I couldn&#x27;t get the # style comments to work, so had to resort to /* */ instead. It&#x27;s very similar because the code is quite simple, but could be a good starting point if you are interested in ARM assembly. You can use the same commands as above to build and run.",1429784382

5893136,comment,5892779,5892779,12,0,fauigerzigerk,,,"PhantomJS is brilliant, but Selenium is a questionable choice for this task. For some reason, the creators of Selenium have decided that passing HTTP status codes back through the API is and always will be outside the scope of their project. So if you request a page and it returns 404 you have no way to find out (other than using crude heuristics). This makes Selenium completely unusable for anything I would have used it for.<p>Fortunately you can do it by using phantomjs directly instead of going through the Selenium WebDriver API. Maybe one day the phantomjs WebDriver API implementation (ghostdriver) will extend the API to pass HTTP status information back to the caller. Until then, this API is unusable (at least for me).",1371477547

Trying to explain the quirks of VHDL in a short tutorial would be a nightmare. The result would inevitably be skipping over stuff rather than explaining it. Coming from a software-development background, once you get into the higher-level aspects of writing VHDL (and I&#x27;d assume Verilog, although I have no experience with it) there&#x27;s a lot of fundamental mistakes you can make in your understanding of how the language is interpreted into hardware. Using their own HDL which doesn&#x27;t have much more than basic primitives stops people falling into those holes.<p>In my opinion, the hard part of hardware description is understanding the concepts, not the language used. If you&#x27;ve got a basic understanding of hardware description, the barriers to moving to VHDL or verilog will be much lower. Coming from the other direction, I can see large similarities between the concepts in their HDL and VHDL - the syntax may be slightly different, but the concepts are the same.",1371477492

If (bigger) startup has an internal recruitment/HR who will review you CV first. As sad as it may sound, make sure their &#x27;keywords&#x27; match yours in the CV. Except for the internal recruiters with a technical background (close to none), they will just go through the list of keywords needed for the role. It&#x27;s more or less a bulletproof approach to pass the first filter which is essential if you even want to be considered. It&#x27;s a pity that persons who have almost zero knowledge about the technologies we use have so much impact and power on deciding whether or not you&#x27;ll be good based on their criteria (again; keywords).<p>Most internal recruiters don&#x27;t care about a cover letter at all, with a big part of them not even reading it. Therefore, keep it very short and rather invest time in a good CV.<p>You  may need to adapt your CV specific to each role specifically (focussing on the role requirements), so be ready to have a CV that can easily be adapted to a specific role.<p>CV
2 pages is ideal (especially if you&#x27;ve held >2 roles), first block is your personal information, followed by your work experience (latest position first). Make some bullet points of what your tasks where at each role. Bullet points are always a win in a CV, always have readability in mind, no HR/Hiring Manager wants to get a long wall of text CV after having gone through 20 previous one&#x27;s.<p>After that, you can always put your Github or SO accounts (more likely if startup), but I would rather talk about this with the Hiring Manager during the phone interview, and if they are curious ask them if you can send your account via email, this also gives you a good opportunity to add some extra details about you which can make you stand out better and get you &#x27;remembered&#x27; longer and more positively if you are in their inbox. You would be surprised how many (older) technical managers still don&#x27;t know SO or Github.<p>Then comes your education, just very short, only mention colleges/uni if so.<p>No profile picture<p>Always print your CV and look at it skeptically and ask yourself &quot;Would I like getting a CV like this?&quot;<p>My experience with places I&#x27;ve worked
London
Quite hard to even get a response, I think companies in London have an easy time hiring with many good candidates. Also no relocation packages or anything like that.<p>Holland
Many tech jobs available and good chances to get hired when not native. Dutch people are quite keen on international employees.<p>Spain
Good supply/demand ratio in favor of demand. From what I&#x27;ve seen tech companies in Spain have hard time hiring quality employees. Also pretty international (Barcelona, Madrid, Malaga).<p>Other
I understand the question is more about the first phase of applying, but when you secure an interview at a company, learn as much as you can about them, you might be asked for it.<p>Basic flow of an interview in Europe is: Company introduces itself -> you introduce yourself -> Q&A specific for the role -> question round where you are free to ask questions. When they ask you to ask questions, do so! Company owners/Hiring Managers/HR love to talk about their company and it&#x27;s a good way to find out about the culture, and it makes you interested in the company which is an advantage. Startups usually don&#x27;t give you any tests or tasks during the interview, they usually stick to asking technical questions. Last but not least, if you are very interested in working at a company and have a interview at their office, make a short presentation. Especially for technical roles this is highly appreciated. Put some effort in this (5-15hours) and use whatever you can or is related to your role. The presentation should match the &quot;you introduce yourself &quot; part of the interview and go a bit deeper into your knowledge. Present it with confidence. When they like it, you will see the interview will get a lot more relaxed and if you&#x27;ve given a good insight in your knowledge/projects you&#x27;ve worked on a lot of the technical questions will already be answered or skipped.<p>The presentation part was twice successful for the 2 roles I ever applied for. I&#x27;ve also advised it to 3 friends of which 2 got hired, of which both the Hiring Manager said they were impressed by the presentation.",1371477002

NATGRID which has been in news for some time , however not known by many does come at the intersection of the civil liberties / privacy versus national security debate. The CMS like the NATGRID would need to have a well defined        access control mechanism to ensure who has access to sensitive info on citizens. I am not sure where does NATGRID stand in terms of its completion which was supposed to be done in multiple phases. NATGRID would integrate and consolidate info n data from multiple central , state databases which would include banks , credit card transactions , Indian Railways , Airline Reservation records , income tax , hotel bookings etc. CMS is in my opinion probably a subset of NATGRID.

It boils down to this: Will a government make you prove a negative, and if you don&#x27;t, will it lock you up?<p>If you have encrypted files, there must have been or still be a key to decrypt it. You will be asked for the key. You will either given them the key, say no, or say you don&#x27;t have it. The first two are no good, so all you have is the denial that you have the key. If government cant find the key, you will be asked to hand it over.<p>And that&#x27;s the crux.<p>What then does the government do? All it can then do is make it an offence to withhold a key. How do they prove you have the key, if they themselves can&#x27;t find it? You then have to prove the impossible, that you do not have the key, a negative. Which, even if you are telling the complete god&#x27;s truth, you can never, ever, prove.<p>So, having an encrypted file, that you cannot or will not decrypt on demand is or will become a criminal offence. All encryption does, in the eyes of government, act as evidence of guilt. The suspect has an encrypted file, we can verify its contents, she wont give us the key, there for she has &quot;something to hide&quot;, and there for must be guilty.<p>I can well imagine encrypted files being stored like athletes blood samples, waiting to be tested or decrypted by future methods.<p>We can not win unless we accept so risk and stop expecting our governments to do <i>everything</i> to stop the bad people. If a bomb goes off in Whatevercity, we must not be angry if it happened because the NSA were NOT collecting mass data, or something similar. We must make it clear to government that we are prepared to trade the risk of being blown up for our privacy and freedom, and that if that freedom contributed to the attack, we <i>MUST</i> accept that, and not suddenly switch and blame government. And the NSA, and the likes, must be allowed to say, &quot;look we could have acted, here is the evidence, but we had to respect freedom and privacy&quot;, and not be lambasted for it. We have to reply, &quot;OK, fair enough, we understand and accept that.&quot; Equally, of course, we need to know they did everything else legally and morally possible.<p>Question is, are we as a people able to do that? Or do we expect zero risk lives?<p>And all that is assuming there is zero risk from the powers government wants. Such laws and thinking creates a whole new avenue of risk.<p>Which is why I for one am quite prepared to say to government, cool it down, back off, set some limits, respect those limits, and if you fail because of that, I both accept it and forgive you, because I want to be free.<p>BTW, one of the few countries I have been to is Norway.

The problem is that most people simply can&#x27;t afford market rate for an iOS engineer, and an equity position simply is not a risk I&#x27;m willing to take.<p>Hence, I am launching (what is temporarily called) the M.V.P. (Minimum Viable Product) program. For a $25 application fee, anyone can submit an app idea. After 200 submissions have been received, we will pick one and develop it over the ensuing four weeks, no extra charges or fees. $25 could potentially develop your app. All submissions will receive, at the very least, our professional feedback covering potential costs, time frames, and technical challenges.<p>The website is located here at www.fullstack360.com<p>A blog post elaborating on the origin of the idea is here at www.fullstack360.wordpress.com<p>Please let me know any of your thoughts and suggestions, as I hope to iterate based on the response!",1371474483

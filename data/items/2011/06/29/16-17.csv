2710183,comment,2709539,2709539,3,0,floby,,,"The important part in Node.js is not ""js"" it's ""node"". The design pattern encouraged is a network of micro-utilities nodes.<p>Ryan Dahl (node.js creator) did not choose javascript because it was cool but because the language was the most suited to its needs. In fact we started several project based on the same principles in different languages (C, lua, and others). Javascript is a good fit because it has no previous history on how to do I/O (which is the main focus in node.js design) except AJAX. It sure has been very helpful in making it popular. But the point is that there could have been Node.whatever. [1]<p>Now if you choose to use Node.js because it's cool, that's fine, but you're missing the important points :<p>1 - It is easy to write. Yes it is. Not only because it's javascript (or coffeescript) but also because the API is very well designed. Because of the agreed on convention of coding, it's also very easy to use modules even when these are not as much documented as node itself. It also would not be as easy to write if it were C or Java. In this netty example [2] you need 4 different classes to write an echo client/server which sums up to approx. 120 lines of code without comments and imports. The node version is 15 lines long at best [3] and clearer.<p>2 - It is efficient. Sure, in raw calculation, lots of other languages are faster. What makes node efficient is asynchronous I/O. You can do async I/O in any other programming language. It's just not that easy and most importantly you don't have to if you are lazy. The fastest language to write async I/O in is probably C. And you can do just that using libuv, the C library behind node.js which is incredibly faster without the Javascript layer.<p>3 - It works at the session/presentation level. Of course it's not as convenient as writing your php file, but it's necessary to ensure that the async model is respected (which is what makes it efficient, which is the reason why you came here in the first place). If you want cool javascript to replace php/JEEE/asp, you can use Jaxer.<p>Of course there are other important points that I'm missing here both because they don't come to mind at the moment and because you should experiment by yourself.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_JKb61EalQ"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_JKb61EalQ</a>\n[2] <a href=""http://docs.jboss.org/netty/3.2/xref/org/jboss/netty/example/echo/package-summary.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://docs.jboss.org/netty/3.2/xref/org/jboss/netty/example...</a>\n[3] <a href=""http://nodejs.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://nodejs.org/</a>",1309366652

When you cut out car payment/car depreciation, insurance, gas, maitenance and take that money and put it towards your housing, it evens out.<p>I own my car outright, but I expect maybe $100 a month in maitenance, $100 a month in insurance, $200 in gas, and probably $100-$200 a month in depreciation. My current rent for a 3BR house with a yard is $1400. I don't need a 3BR, but I literally can not rent anything smaller that isn't a  shitty apartment, so basically I can't spend less than that.<p>So what can I get for $1900 in NYC? From what I've seen, I'd like it better than what I have right now. Will I get exactly the same square footage? Of course not. I will have someone living above me and below me where now I have a single family home. But it's an apples to oranges comparison, it would take millions of dollars to buy the amount of land I'm currently renting and build a single family home - becuase its a <i>city</i>. It's just inherently different.<p>I want enough room to have a bedroom, a bathroom, an office with my computer and a pull-out couch for friends, a kitchen to cook in and a family room/dining room to have a couch, a TV and a table to eat at. I can pull that off on my current salary whether its in NYC or elsewhere. So a cost of living calculator doesn't take into effect the fact that although the dimensions of the room are smaller, the NYC apartment is functionally the same as my current one that is far, far, bigger.",1309366597

2710163,comment,2710018,2710018,2,0,bhousel,,,"One of the biggest challenges with our school system is that while you're immersed in it, it becomes difficult to imagine anything outside of that experience.  You can't get a ""big picture"" view of your life and how your unique talents and interests can fit into the bigger world -- high school is your world.<p>You will eventually graduate and move on, and realize that most of the stuff that you did in high school was really not all that significant, in the big picture.  Your lack of motivation is probably because you're starting to realize this as your time in school is almost finished and you (and your peers) begin to ask questions like ""What comes next?"" and ""Why can't I get there already?""<p>Luckily the answers to these questions don't really matter all that much either.  People take all kinds of paths through life, and there is no right next step, or important thing to work on.  You can be forgiven for thinking this way, because school trains you to think this way by putting you into grades and preparing a curriculum that advances you forward towards an arbitrary finish line ""graduation"".<p>So what should you do?  Do whatever interests you, as this is where your motivation will come from.  If you're not motivated to code, don't code.  Take a part time job, or exercise, or socialize, or take up a new hobby, or volunteer.  All of these things will make you a better person (and a better coder).  You'll meet people who are not coders, and it might remind you why you like programming so much - or you might find something that you like better.<p>However, be careful with the ""Do whatever interests you"" philosophy. You probably do have some standards that you want to hold yourself to, and you want to keep improving yourself, and you want to be a mostly free person (have money).  So you probably shouldn't just sit around and smoke pot and play playstation because it interests you.<p>I believe that ""adulthood"" begins when a person consciously decides to do things because they are difficult to do and no longer decides to do things because they are easy to do.",1309366221

Government regulation created the slow, expensive Internet access in the US, government regulation helped create faster, cheaper internet access in the UK and Europe. Government regulation isn't an atomic entity that either exists or doesn't, or there's ""more"" or ""less"". There's good regulation and bad regulation, and sometimes the best regulation is none at all but that's not always the case.<p>As a little-l libertarian, I observe that when markets have real competition, consumers and society benefit and even the providers globally benefit. When the free market is allowed to be monopolized, consumers and society loses. I believe that it is a valid use of regulation to force markets to remain non-monopolized, even if it is a ""natural monopoly"". Regulations to encourage this are good; regulations that enhance the monopoly rather than busting it are bad, and there's no way in which I am being a hypocrite about the goodness of regulation.<p>(The general metric of good regulation is ""benefits exceed costs"", and the general metric of bad regulation is of course the opposite. However, there is legitimate room to argue about some of the details, in particular costs and benefits to exactly whom. But even within those constraints, it's hard to crash your economy with regulations whose benefits routinely exist costs, and easy to crash with the other way around, so you really have to have a pretty freakin' sweet system before these arguments are really the biggest problems you are facing.

I used to always wonder why US was so behind in terms of broadband deployment and the answers that we given to me were always around 'density'. However, there are densely populated areas in US that can create better broadband experience.<p>The challenge here is that the larger telecom companies (AT&T, Verizon) are required by law to sell their loops to other carriers, but there is a lot of CAPEX needed even with the fiber/copper look. It costs around $1000 per subscriber to bring a broadband TV service home even from the neighborhood (connecting from neighborhood to home and all the equipment in the home). This high CAPEX is a barrier for new entrants in this market.<p>Another reason why US is behind is that the US Federal Communications Commission (FCC) is not allowing the telecom companies in US to charge users based on their tiered internet usage. Therefore, price per mbps is flat no matter how much bandwidth you use. On the other hand, European telecom companies are allowed to charge extra for higher bandwidth usage.<p>Once these two barriers fall (cloud based home TV management and tiered pricing) there will be more competition in US.",1309365870

These valuations are based not on revenues but how much the current investors will be able to sell their shares to some later investor. The issue becomes that once Facebook goes public investing tends to skew much more towards fundamental, which may cause a dip in the stock price.  Facebook's  current P/E somewhere between 70-110? (I'll source these numbers in a sec).   This would indicate an extremely high growth company ie in the front of the hockey stick. I think many would start to argue that Facebooks growth is going to start to flatten out. They already say about 500M active users so thats 1/12 the worlds population their user base doesn't have much more room to grow (though increasing revenue per user still still probably has some room to move).<p>Personally as a small investor I'm staying away from Facebook when it goes public its too volatile (unless I can get pre IPO shares ;-)  But at least an argument could be made that a short isn't a horrible play. There's a really good chance of Facebook's IPO starting extremely high and then seeing a significant dip a few months out of the gate as people start taking their money out.<p>P/E Numbers - 70B valuation (widely reported)<p>Earnings 1B - 600M.<p>P/E 70 - 116<p><a href=""http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/41521349/ns/business-us_business/t/facebook-profit-try-million/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/41521349/ns/business-us_business...</a><p><a href=""http://www.computerworld.com/s/article/9203999/Facebook_s_leaked_financials_show_possible_1B_profit_in_11"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.computerworld.com/s/article/9203999/Facebook_s_le...</a>",1309365864

Get lots of good sleep (which should not be hard). You need more sleep at that age, 10 hours is good.<p>The key thing is to notice the disconnect between mind and body, and work on improving your body mechanics so that it is aligned with your minds purpose.

Even if you suck, there will always be someone to hire you because the market of software engineers is hot and the numbers play in your favor</i><p>As someone who has tried to figure out how to live in the area I grew up (northwestern Minnesota) instead of New York or the Bay area, this isn't quite accurate. In many (most?) flyover states software jobs pay 1/5-1/3 what you would make in NYC. The only technology needed is .NET or sometimes Java - the last 5 years of ""scaling Ruby"" or whatever you were doing, are more like a five year gap in your resume. The number of available positions are orders of magnitude less than NYC or the Bay. Often, you can get paid more and have an easier time getting work if you're an IT dude, rather than a software developer. The other option is being a remote worker for someplace cool but you usually need to have a career somewhere else for a few years to make connections. Of course, the American outback might be a good place to hole up and work on your own software startup for a while, but as soon as you need to hire you'll have to move again.<p>If you want to be able to throw a dart at a map and pick up high paying work wherever you want, the answer is still being an MD. The worst MD in North Dakota can make what the best software engineer in Manhattan makes. In a weird inversion of most employment reality, doctors can often make far more in a rural setting than they can in a mid-sided metro, due to ""hardship post"" style compensation.

The normal strategy is to use a minimal bid in a certain area, and create an attractive ad that gets people to click. However, this costs money, as you pay based on a per-click basis.<p>What I wanted to do, was generate a lot of awareness. When people are aware of your product and see it advertised everywhere, it's more likely they'll check you out. If they happen to check you out after hearing from a friend, it won't even be an ad-referral, and it won't cost you a cent. How do you create awareness without using money?<p>I have no basis for saying this, and my only proof is a very successful campaign that I ran doing this. Since I've shut my project down, the trade secret isn't very useful anymore. I think there's an innate appeal for certain ads. A lot of ads make it blatantly obvious that they're there, but just doesn't make you want to click. Not because the product looks bad - but I just don't want to click some ads. I know a lot of friends also have this feeling, and a small study I conducted confirmed this.<p>My strategy was this: Bid minimal amounts after researching bids in certain areas, and create an ad that shoves its name, and possibly basic idea into an user's face. However, do not provide any incentive to click - at all. In fact, make it ugly, but not ugly enough to make your product or service seem bad. This is tricky, and takes some getting used to. The end result is a very LOW conversion rate (usually considered as a failure) - which is exactly what we want. I've gotten a bunch of repeat impressions onto users, without having to pay for them. If they happen to hear about it from a friend, they're now much more likely to check it out, because they're familiar with the name.<p>I've come up with a bunch of strategies like this, and I really wish I wrote them all down so I could share them.

I think this is a poor argument for a number of reasons:<p>1) Bid ask pricing is a very well established economic model. In active market, which I would argue Facebook has due to SecondMarket et al, it tends to closely approximate the value of the asset. Certainly there are market or sector wide bubbles, but that is an entirely different argument.<p>2) The counterexample used is poor. He uses the example of Digg which was almost completely illiquid at the time of that article.

2709984,comment,2705926,2706057,1,0,IanDrake,,,"Sure.  Obviously you need a graphic artist for the visual assets, but that you can start small too.<p>First determine the game's flow.  Typically I see: App Icon (click) -> Splash Screen (wait) -> Top Level Menu (click) -> Low Level Menu (click) -> Game Play (up to you)<p>If you want to get comfortable with your dev resources, start by giving a graphics designer an overview of the project and say you want a splash screen, app icon, and top level menu, with more work to come.<p>Here you'll need to help the designer understand who your target market is.  Do some research into your market so you can guide your designer.  For instance a dungeon game for teens might be dark and edgy, whereas a game with Puppies Pillow Fighting&trade; might use light pastel colors and look cartoon like.<p>Then get a coder to create a shell of an app using those elements.  Sure there's no game play yet, but it will get you started with short money.<p>Now you have an app that can be tested, it has an icon, pauses on a splash screen and then displays a menu.  After that, you should have a good feel for how to interact with your resources.  Are they responsive to communication?  Did they deliver what you asked for?  Did they meet their own budget and time estimates?  Were the deliverable work?<p>Again, be upfront with budget.  For the dev resources, you should know how much they charge per hour.  Then ask how long it should take to develop the assets.  Make it clear that they're only to bill you up to the estimated amount.<p>Then give them check-in points where they stop work and contact you for feedback.  For instance, tell the designer to start with the splash screen and show you a rough draft along with the amount of time spent developing it (so you know how much of your budget is left).<p>This limits your loss if you don't like them, their concept, or their work.  After four hours you can decide if they're heading down the right path.<p>Developers are more difficult because partial software doesn't do anything.  So, get your designer working first, while that's going on you should be finding a developer.  Once you have the assets from the designer get the developer to create a shell of an app using them.<p>Now for minimal money you should have an app that loads on your phone and a set of dev resources that you've proven you can work with.  From there you just keep the overlapping dev cycle going.  Designer is working on cycle 2, while the developer is working on cycle 1, and so on.  At the end of each cycle you should have a working app with which you can judge their work.<p>This method is slower and perhaps slightly more expensive in the long run, but it can be less risky than handing over 20-40K to one company and hoping you get what you want in the end.",1309363684

The grammar is very simple and it uses the Latin alphabet.<p>But learning to hear and speak the various tones has been a real struggle. Even now I still have a hard time picking them out and carefully enunciating them. It doesn&#x27;t help that there&#x27;s a huge amount of regional variation in pronunciation and vocabulary. I&#x27;ve had to work hard to unlearn some habits from English, particularly raising my tone slightly at the end of sentences.",1398117583

This affords practical flexibility, such as dynamically requiring files (as long as the dynamically required modules are required in a manifest module with it&#x27;s own require method).<p>RequireJs is a runtime tool, in which you load modules from the browser.<p>You can use both by packaging files together using browserify and dynamically loading these packaged files using requirejs.<p>I personally use browserify and have my own lightweight dynamic loader. This allows me to be free of the requirejs boilerplate logic in every file.<p>One cool thing about Browserify if you can package a bunch of lightweight & focused javascript snippets you find on the internet, instead of using heavyweight libraries. Often times, the essential nugget of logic is tiny, compared to the boilerplate, cruft, & edge case concerns of the library.",1398117533

7624232,comment,7623078,7624088,2,0,aetherson,,,"A few points:<p>First, a &quot;strawman&quot; argument is when I attack a position you do not hold.  I don&#x27;t think I claimed anywhere that you were speaking to single-family homes -- I certainly didn&#x27;t intend to.<p>Second, I&#x27;m genuinely confused as to what line you&#x27;re drawing -- you seem to think it&#x27;s obvious -- between my rights as someone who lives near other people while renting, and someone who lives near other people while owning.  On some level, my risk seems greater: if I were a renter, I could after all just move if my neighbors prove troublesome, while if I own, they can destroy the value of an asset I have even if I personally flee the scene.<p>I agree with you that we can see some avenues of potential risk that apply only to people living in multi-tenant buildings (keys, etc).  But this is what I mean about your point being under-argued: all you seem to be doing is listing some potential negative externalities.  Everything has potential negative externalities.  You could hit me with your car.  You could create a fire in your home that would burn down city blocks.<p>What seems to be missing is both:<p>1.  Some kind of statement about those potentials becoming actuals.  How much do the neighbors of AirBnB hosts ACTUALLY suffer?  Are the stories of floating brothels etc rare exceptions, or commonplace?<p>2.  Some kind of at least suggestion of where the line between actionable and non-actionable externalities lies.<p>I do not mean to suggest that these are either easy requirements to satisfy, or that I&#x27;m trying to dismiss your argument.  I&#x27;m just trying to move the conversation past the listing of possible negative externalities.  I agree with you.  They exist.  But where do we go from there?",1398117469

That&#x27;s fine, but anyone with any knowledge of start-ups should instantly see how the ideas put forth by Piketty are destructive. If I invest in a start-up, that&#x27;s property. So next year, if the start-up grows and I&#x27;m taxed on that growth, I might be forced to sell my private shares to meet my tax obligations. How am I going to do that? And, the year after that, maybe the start-up tanks to a very low valuation, yet I still owe a tax. How is anything supposed to be created in that environment? Or are start-ups somehow special? Do they get special treatment? What about a family farm? Does the farmer have to sell off some land every year to meet his tax obligation? Or does he just continuously raise the price of food every year to offset the wealth tax? I would love to hear some answers from the Marx 2.0 crowd.",1398117382

The stumbling block is not the farmworker visa, or the afghan/iraqi translator visas, but the huge &quot;citizenship for people already present in the country without documentation&quot; issue, which is inherently political because one party assumes all of those new citizens will vote for the other party.  &quot;We must have comprehensive immigration reform&quot; means &quot;all or nothing&quot;; without that, we&#x27;d get founder visas, iraq/afghanistan visas, and farmworker visas right away, and then continued lack of action on the ~12mm people already in the country who are in limbo.  So, donating to a political party on this issue actually pushes things <i>backwards</i>.  (This is independent of whether you feel all of these things together are better or worse than some subset, or none; it&#x27;s just strategy.)<p>(and, on the R side, it&#x27;s the stupid Hastert Rule; a majority of the House supports even comprehensive immigration reform, but not a majority of the majority party.

7624198,comment,7622432,7622432,9,0,byuu,,,"A very insightful article. In my experience though, having studied both; and also from a friend who is moderately fluent in both; I believe Japanese is more difficult than Chinese.<p>When it comes to the writing system, a Chinese character can have one pronunciation (two in very rare exceptions.) A Japanese character can have ten takes on how to pronounce the Chinese reading (onyomi), and be hammered into another ten Japanese-native words and verbs (kunyomi), and six ways they can be pronounced in names that your IME will <i>refuse</i> to ever recognize (nanori). The problem of not knowing how to pronounce what you are reading is made far worse in Japanese. With the one nice exception that material designed for young children sometimes have the syllables written above the characters for reference (furigana.)<p>Next up you have the SOV writing style instead of SVO. So unless you enjoy thinking and speaking like Yoda, you get to flip entire sentences in your head. In real-time.<p>And then you have particles that can mean a hundred different things based on context. Even some native speakers tend to have no idea when to use &#x27;wa&#x27; or &#x27;ga&#x27;, it just becomes instinctual after a lifetime of language use.<p>Next, there&#x27;s the verb conjugations. &quot;They&#x27;re simple, there&#x27;s only one polite form, a handful of plain forms, and the two irregular verb forms!&quot; ... and then they add on about a thousand possible verb endings that imply different meanings (-tai = to want, -takereba = to not want, -zu ni = another negative form like -nai but slightly more polite, etc.) And then you get the fun of stacking them! -saserareru (to be forced to do something) + -zu ni -> -saserarezu. And then you can extend that to be in the passive form, or to have it occur in the past ... and then you can just outright fuse two verbs together to form new ones! Tsuku + Nukeru -> Tsukinukeru + all your verb endings above = aneurysm to decipher in real-time conversation.<p>Then you have the polite language system (keigo, or alternate ways to say just about everything based on who you are talking to) where you have to practice for years before you won&#x27;t either sound like a school girl or offend someone.<p>There are other hard parts (regional dialects, classical forms, synonyms, etc), but since Chinese shares them, I omit them here.<p>The big red herring is the two syllabic alphabets, hiragana and katakana. Those are very easy. But they do become a nightmare from hell when you are faced with a script that has no kanji at all (like older video games.) The synonym problem, on a scale of 1 to 10, goes from a 12 to a 50.<p>When I look at Chinese ... the biggest negative it has over Japanese, is that it&#x27;s intensely more difficult in spoken form than Japanese. It&#x27;s very hard to hear and reproduce the tonal marks correctly, yet that can completely change the meaning of words. And with so many similar sounds, you end up with poems like this: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lion-Eating_Poet_in_the_Stone_Den"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lion-Eating_Poet_in_the_Stone_D...</a><p>Despite a lot of differences between how the Chinese and Japanese use the same characters, and in fact characters that only exist in one or the other ... horrifyingly, I find that I understand more when playing a Chinese game than a Japanese game, despite having studied Chinese for less than 1/20th as much as I have studied Japanese.",1398117103

Maybe in that case, listors assume more risk, but as it is now, I don&#x27;t see property owners being proactive and mining listing sites for their properties. Illegal in some areas or not, the law moves too slow to appease the crowd. Hell, I even tried (I took down the website though, might open source it if enough interest) launching a SaaS app last year that did just that, and talked to some of my Real estate friends in NYC and here&#x27;s the feedback one gave me from the landlords/managers she talked to:<p>&quot;I spoke with 6 landlords and one real estate property manger and here&#x27;s what I left with:<p>1. All the landlords with smaller portfolios agreed that there was no need for such a service, especially if they paid for it. They knew their buildings very well - and the doorman always kept them in the loop.<p>2. The property manager did not see a use for the service at all. He was actually a bit offended that I asked him about it, but he had a few good points:<p>- Buildings with property managers keep pretty good tabs on who is coming in and out of their building. Especially if there is a doorman. - He questioned how data on the website would be verified and felt that simply &quot;pulling listings&quot; from other websites was not enough. There are inaccurate listings all over the web - especially in NYC.<p>3. My personal thoughts are that you would need a dedicated team to verify and confirm air bnb services. Also, after they find out that someone is illegally subletting - what next? Does the website offer a solution? The landlords I spoke with typically used illegal subletting to charge their own tenant additional fees (like $100/day until the illegal subletter is out) so in the case someone is silly enough to do so - they can make money off of it.&quot;<p>The cognitive dissonance on one side in this market is telling me that if airbnb looses this battle, I should do something for the side of the market that is actually trying to solve their problems and pay for it. But, If you know a landlord or property manager that actually has this problem and wants to make money of trying to solve the problems arising because of the negative externalities rather than moan that government isn&#x27;t doing enough, point me in their direction because I would love to talk more!

It&#x27;s not just learning a new syntax—in fact, since you&#x27;re embedding into a known language, it isn&#x27;t even that new—it&#x27;s about getting more control. You can pass rules around, modify them and do whatever arbitrarily complex tasks you need in a natural, straightforward way using your favorite programming language. You don&#x27;t have to contort yourself and bend over backwards to fit the logic you want into Make&#x27;s limited and peculiar language.<p>Your build system is an integral part of your whole program and you want to treat it just like any other code. This means refactoring, this means modularity, this means libraries, this means no copying and pasting... All this is far easier with a system embedded in your main language than in Make. You can use your existing tooling, debuggers and frameworks to support your build system. If you&#x27;re using a typed language, you can use the types to both constrain and guide your build files, making everything safer.<p>Using an embedded DSL integrates far better with the rest of your ecosystem than relying on Make.<p>Apart from making the logic <i>of</i> your build system easier to describe and maintain, an embedded DSL also makes arbitrary meta-tasks easier. You might want to monitor random parts of your build process, report to different services, connect to different front-ends (an IRC bot, a CI system...) and maybe even intelligently plug into the features of your main language. Wouldn&#x27;t it be great to have a make system that&#x27;s deeply aware of how your server is configured, how your type system works, what your compile-time metaprogramming is doing an so on?<p>You could just glue together a bunch of disparate scripts with a Make file. Or you could use a DSL and call these services through well-defined, maybe even <i>typed</i> interfaces! No need for serializing and deserializing: you can keep everything inside your system.<p>Sure, if you&#x27;re just going to use your DSL as a different syntax for Make, you&#x27;re not gaining much.

7624074,comment,7621262,7622241,3,0,robert_tweed,,,"I&#x27;ve had a long standing interest in this kind of semantic typing. Ironically, one of the things people hate about Java is that it has a deeply engrained culture of using semantic typing everywhere, except that it uses class &quot;boxing&quot; rather than just having something like the type system in Go (typedef on steroids) or something axiom based like Haskell.<p>So that&#x27;s why so much Java code ends up looking like this:<p><pre><code>  //class FurryThing implements Thing {}\n  //class RubberThing implements Thing {}\n  \n  FuzzyThing furbie = new FuzzyThing();\n  RubberThing bouncyball = new RubberThing();\n  DoStuffToThing( Thing(furbie) );\n  DoStuffToThing( Thing(bouncyball) );\n</code></pre>\nIn fact, it&#x27;s not uncommon to see things like class Furbie extends FuzzyThing, so you end up with very specific types that don&#x27;t necessary behave differently, but do add some <i>supposed</i> semantic precision to the code. Unfortunately, you don&#x27;t get much benefit from it in Java, so it just ends up being a hassle, resulting in lots of programmer-forced unsafe casting and just as many runtime errors as you&#x27;d have got with simpler types. This is not a fault of the language, just poor implementation which rightly or wrongly appears to be idiomatic in Java.<p>The type system in, for example, Go is much simpler, and allows you to create semantic types that actually <i>are</i> the underlying type instead of creating a class wrapper (called boxing in Java, e.g., boxed int is class Integer, which is an object containing only an int), which means you can define a type like &#x27;kilogram&#x27; that&#x27;s really just a float, but the type system won&#x27;t silently cast a &#x27;kilogram&#x27; value to a float or vice-versa because it knows they are different things.<p>I haven&#x27;t got into Haskell in much detail yet but it just basically takes that a few steps further and allows you to define the characteristics of each custom type based on axioms, that describe things like whether it&#x27;s commutative or associative, the range of allowed values, etc.<p>This kind of axiomatic semantic typing is clearly a lot more powerful, but as yet it hasn&#x27;t really found its way into mainstream languages yet. Go takes the view that it&#x27;s too complicated for what is intended to be a low-level language. Rust looks interesting because it aims to be equally low level, but provide some of the same rich typing you&#x27;d find in Haskell. Unfortunately it&#x27;s far from stable, but it&#x27;ll be interesting to see where it ends up.",1398116096

That any man-made vessel can be docked follows from the fact that it is man-made: some sort of contraption was used to hold it during manufacture, and then it was removed. So long as I can make a vessel big enough to reproduce that environment, I can dock the smaller vessel.<p>The need for the ability to independently maneuver comes from the legal nature of the issue. At some point, legal responsibility for the vessel transfers from the captain or pilot to the dockmaster. In conventional shipping, that point is when the bow crosses the plane of the dock&#x27;s gate.<p>When a vessel is berthed, some mechanism bridges the gap between the facility and the vessel, like ropes, or, in the case of the Dragon Cargo, a robotic arm manipulated from the station.",1398115650

As a result,\n  a long scheduler decision time means that nearly all \n  cluster resources are locked down for a long time, inaccessible\n  to other schedulers. The only resources available for other\n  schedulers in this situation are the few becoming available\n  while the slow scheduler is busy. These are often insufficient\n  to schedule an above-average size batch job, meaning that\n  the batch scheduler cannot make progress while the service\n  scheduler holds an offer. It nonetheless keeps trying, and\n  as a consequence, we find that a number of jobs are abandoned \n  because they did not finish scheduling their tasks by\n  the 1,000-attempt retry limit in the Mesos case (Figure 7c).\n  This pathology occurs because of Mesos’s assumption\n  of quick scheduling decisions, small jobs and high re-\n  source churn, which do not hold for our service jobs. Mesos\n  could be extended to make only fair-share offers, although\n  this would complicate the resource allocator logic, and the\n  quality of the placement decisions for big or picky jobs\n  would likely decrease, since each scheduler could only see\n  a smaller fraction of the available resources. We have raised\n  this point with the Mesos team; they agree about the \n  limitation and are considering to address it in future work.\n\n</code></pre>\nIts worth noting that Andy Konwinski was a coauthor on both Mesos & Omega, so I&#x27;d hope they (Omega authors) represented Mesos&#x27; capabilties accurately.

And of course people <i>do</i> complain about that.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.cnet.com/news/meet-the-group-trying-to-make-at-t-very-un-at-t-like/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cnet.com/news/meet-the-group-trying-to-make-at-t-...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.att.com/Investor/ATT_Annual/2013/downloads/att_2013ar_completefinancialreview.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.att.com/Investor/ATT_Annual/2013/downloads/att_20...</a>",1398114136

7623837,comment,7622432,7623278,1,0,yongjik,,,"Well, as I said, I personally found remembering Chinese characters about as difficult as remembering English spellings.  Of course, either comprises a very small part of the difficulty of learning either language (and I don&#x27;t speak Chinese so I can&#x27;t really say anything about it), but since everybody seemed to be fixating on Chinese <i>characters</i>... (shrug)<p>I am ready to be persuaded if there&#x27;s a convincing argument that Chinese is objectively more difficult.  What I was trying to say is that asking <i>Chinese</i> people how hard it is proves nothing.  And (I presume) a native English speaker comparing Chinese and European languages doesn&#x27;t instill a lot of confidence, either.  Of course Chinese is harder than French... to an average English speaker.",1398114126

The line about sexual or gender-based harassment is part of the detail leading up to the general statement of no legal wrongdoing, which is followed by the statement about errors of judgement, etc., that do not rise to the level of legal wrongdoing.<p>Harassment that does not constitute legally-prohibited discrimination would fall into the category of error that they have expressly stated <i>did</i> occur.",1398114113

7623827,comment,7616420,7617274,1,0,ezy,,,"What makes Smart TV&#x27;s basically useless long-term is that throwaway line you put on the end about the cable box.<p>The same is true of AppleTV, playstation, xbox and every game console in existence.  Some of this is obviously hardware based, but a lot of it is about differentiation.  CableCard has existed for at least a decade now, but good luck trying to get your cable company to admit it.  Every single one of these guys wants you to stay in their particular ecosystem, and &quot;smart&quot; TV is just another ecosystem Samsung wants you to buy into with the associated limitations -- either introduced by Samsung or the other vendors (lockout).<p>What people <i>really</i> need is better integration between all the devices they hook to their TV.  It&#x27;s bizarre (but like I said, not totally unexpected) that a consumer electronics device is so hard to use that way compared to a radically more complex personal computer (plug most usb devices from a big box store into a mac or pc and it&#x27;ll just work for its intended purposes without a hassle nowadays).<p>One way to accomplish that is to shove all the functionality into one device, but as I mentioned above, it doesn&#x27;t actually work except for a few limited cases.  Honestly, the closest you get to a true &quot;smart&quot; experience is a top-end harmony remote -- and that&#x27;s obviously not that close at all.<p>My basic objection to smart tv is that I have the same experience using a harmony remote, it adds nothing.  And the smart features are virtually guaranteed to whither away long before the actual tv outlives its usefulness.  It&#x27;s like the digital channel tuner on the same set -- useful in odd circumstances, but practically useless having long been long surpassed by cable tv.",1398114032

Regardless if it&#x27;s a highway, bus, or a sidewalk, when you&#x27;re in a crowd, you&#x27;re forced to play a zero-sum game with the people around you. Even in cultures where people don&#x27;t drive, the commute is listed as one of the largest stresses people experience.<p>Self-driving cars are great because for the first time, you have a machine that commutes for you. There&#x27;s no competition to get in the car, no competition to sit down in the car, and once the car starts moving, you don&#x27;t have to care about how the car navigates the competition on the road.<p>It&#x27;s true that on the large scale, it&#x27;s less efficient than public transportation, but on an individual level, it&#x27;s the best option.",1398114018

The ones with the most listings are those people that have spent the most time, energy and money building out the Airbnb platform and they are having their business/livelihood wiped out with no warning.<p>To preempt what I imagine will be a response to this question, which is that these users are violating the TOS with Airbnb, I have two points: the first is that Airbnb itself is violating many &quot;TOSs&quot; - laws - so it doesn&#x27;t give them very good moral standing here.<p>The second point is stronger (I think), which is that Airbnb&#x27;s position here is logically inconsistent. They either believe strongly that you should be able to do what you want with the properties you own, or you don&#x27;t.

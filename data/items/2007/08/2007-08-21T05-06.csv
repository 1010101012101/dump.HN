This is in part due to upbringing, and your system would presumably attempt to remedy that, but to what extent will it succeed? <p>Being surrounded by smart, driven people is good for you, but there are minor side effects. For example, you start to think of the average person as far more similar to you and your friends than he really is.",1187675180

Ruby can be a bit stranger to newcomers (in my opinion), people like to be ""clever"" in ruby, and then there is the hype (this is my personal opinion - although I find ruby much easier to use myself, and its OO approach suits me a bit more then python).<p>As for mind expanding, I like Scheme - as taught by MIT in the SICP series (you can watch the videos on google video). It would be interesting to see that taught to someone new to programming (sorry to make an experiment of you !). Someone tried to teach this stuff (kind of) to me once in miranda (didn't work to well as a first programming language).<p>As for practical messy stuff, then look into Java (for basic static strong typing and endless tools) and Perl if you must, the basics of C to wrap your head around pointers may help - I learned that around the same time as motorola assembler (much nicer then intel) and it helped form a mental model of 'on the metal' computation which I found helpful.<p>Another angle: Haskell seems to be popular for functional programming (as it is pure) - many people think functional's time has come, and there are some useful videos introducing it here: <a href=""http://sequence.complete.org/hwn/20070807"" rel=""nofollow"">http://sequence.complete.org/hwn/20070807</a><p>Stick to things where you can get all the tools you need for free on the platform you use (and they are easy to get running). <p>

If you want to make a blog, go take a look at some blogging software already out there and learn the language it's written in. (Wordpress -> PHP w/ HTML & CSS just because they're always helpful)<p>Then, once you've got your feet wet, learn another one. I feel like I never understood one language until I could compare it to another.<p>Python and Ruby are great for hammering out functionality and learning. Common Lisp/Scheme are great for widening your perception of how problems can be solved. I don't want to say much about C because I'm not proficient with it, but it definitely gives you a closer feeling to how your computer runs your code even if it obfuscates the problem a little. Learn Haskell/OCaml when you're feeling lucky. They will break your brain and then rebuild it in crazy, inventive new ways.",1187673615

Great place to get started but not the big time.<p>When the SFP started, I had no idea that Boston had much current startup activity.  I mean, I knew a couple places that started there but not as many as, say, Seattle.  But I think now it's a great place for the first stage of a startup's life.  Lots of hackers and lots of financiers that can get you going.  But the M&A, influential investors and press is just so extremely concentrated in the Bay Area.<p>Don't get me wrong, I'm an LA guy and am fond of Cambridge, so I'm not a homer here.  But that's the reality, especially for companies as determined to make it as the YC companies presumably are.",1187673423

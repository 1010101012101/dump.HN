http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2485098
And this comment:
http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2486093<p>The answer(s) to this question may be a fairly obvious to most here and I'm sure a number of responses have already been considered, but I know I'm not the only one here who'd like some tips from more seasoned professionals regarding how to become a well-known contractor.  Starting from basically nothing but a degree and a few years of experience, what's the best way to reach out to potential clients in an area of expertise?  (I'm leaving this generalized so other readers can better relate.)<p>Concerning the post above, there's no doubt that my coding abilities are way above average... and I've had a taste of the corporate world... I worked for a $17 billion company for a few years, and while the people there were enjoyable, the work I did was not.  And I'm definitely not alone when I say I prefer to be my own boss.<p>I currently have a couple startups in the works (one is actually to help bootstrap the other) but I don't expect to see any money from them for a while.  And I'm nearly broke at the moment since I'm in my early 20s and have been working on my startup(s) day-in, day-out since June 2010.  And in all honesty, being broke has put quite the hold on my social life for months now and it's gotten extremely depressing.<p>So with that said, what do you seasoned professionals suggest in terms of bringing in decent paying contract work (i.e., larger projects, but not <i>too</i> large)... and soon?  Is this unreasonable?  I do realize this is what nearly everyone is after but I'm no mere mortal! <i>smirk</i> I complete larger projects in a fraction of the time with rarely matched efficiency and perfection (just ask anyone I've worked with!)... But of course coding ability only accounts for a small fraction of my value... Giving clients exactly what they need to make their businesses run <i>way</i> more efficiently is what I do best.  What I do lack is the ability to make this known to a large group of potential clients... Or should I just contact them all directly?  I hate to be spammy though.  I've checked out some freelancing sites and knocked out a few smaller projects but have seen nothing even remotely close to the aforementioned comment.",1303896981

2488878,comment,2488634,2488634,8,0,busted,,,"Speaking from my experience looking for internships during school and for jobs after graduating, the questions you ask your interviewer are really important. Sure, people tell you that it's important because you want to look interested or like you've given the company thought, but more than that, as a person who's new to the workforce, it's important for you to learn about what's out there and what to expect.<p>Answers to questions about work/life balance like, ""What time do people usually come in and leave?"", ""Do coworkers hang out outside of work?"", etc. differ greatly between companies.<p>For internships, knowing the scope of your internship and the level of responsibility is a must.<p>Questions about workflow are also crucial. Where do new ideas for products come from? If I have an idea what's the process for getting it implemented?<p>And if you can't think of anything else, just ask what <i>they</i> think you should know about the company. Maybe you don't know what you don't know!<p>You shouldn't feel like you're walking a fine line between looking disinterested for not asking questions and looking entitled for asking them. Even if you bombed the interview (and who hasn't), asking questions about the company will give you more information for comparison at the companies whose interviews you succeed at. And if you have multiple rounds of interviews, feel free to ask the same question to multiple people to get differing opinions.<p>The company you go to is going to be part of your life for a long time, educate yourself about work environments just like you educate yourself about your field.",1303895752

For a large network, that doesn't seem like an unreasonable burden.<p>Their business concerns are merely for their own good to try to protect their brand, not to actually benefit their customers. They will spend more on just PR, never mind making good any actual losses, than on just doing it right in the first place. At this point, they deserve to look shitty, <i>because they were shitty</i>. In the case of lying about it, that should be a serious corporate crime (and I think this sort of disclosure is required in most jurisdictions.)<p>More generally, why do businesses pay almost anything to protect their good names, but only after they themselves have let their reputation fall into the deep shit? Look at how much BP must have spent over the deepwater horizon spill, compared to how much it would have cost to maintain their equipment. Never mind the banking crisis. An ounce of rational prevention is worth a tonne of PR fire-fighting  why do companies struggle so much with mitigating downside risk?",1303894882

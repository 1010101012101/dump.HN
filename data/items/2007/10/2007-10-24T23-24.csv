72266,comment,72056,72244,0,0,Goladus,,,"I agree that int a[10] feels more natural, though if the brackets are empty my only preference is that the language pick one or the other.  Don't make ""int[] a;"" and ""int a[];"" equally valid syntax, but totally different semantics.<p>My main point is that this is a relatively cosmetic issue relative to the ability to use 'foreach' syntax instead of iterator objects and while loops.

72256,comment,72056,72056,0,0,BrandonM,,,"""A lot of the features are designed to make it easier for the compiler writer.""<p>That kind of scares me. Who cares how hard the compiler writer's job is? A compiler is written once, whereas the programs that the compiler compiles (hopefully) comprise a much larger body of code.<p>That said, the article sure made D sound like an improvement over C++, with many of the same benefits. Of course, getting rid of the preprocessor seems kind of strange... I've used quite a few macros in my C code. Even the crappy macros you get with C (as compared to, say, Lisp) are certainly better than none at all.",1193267481

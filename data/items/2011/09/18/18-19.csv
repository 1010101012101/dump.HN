It won't be a full iPhone, just the phone part and basic iPod functions. It will be very affordable.<p>edgeless iPhone - (i.e. no bevel at all, so putting two side-by-side would form a seamless larger display - tho not intended for that); the screen resolution would be the same for compatibility, but with smaller dimensions, by using a finer dpi than retina (this is justifiable if you hold it closer to your eyes; for young people with better eyesight; and because you could actually see the pixels anyway - it wasn't <i>really</i> retina). Also, thinner and cheaper, with better battery life. Basically, the same as the current iPhone, in a smaller, cooler package.<p>pro iPhone - dual-core, same battery life. Apple doesn't really believe in this product, because it's already fast enough for what the iPhone needs - but it's necessary for enthusiasts (and who knows, maybe they'll create a killer-app that really does need quad-core?); and to retain leadership over Samsung.<p>iPad 3 - 2048x1536 quad-core iPad with a GPU that surpasses current game consoles. This isn't as hard as it sounds, as current consoles are quite old (i.e. xbox360 is 6yo - that's 4 Moore's Law doublings, or x16). There will be a couple of AAA titles available on it. For battery-life, the GPU and CPU can run at in low-power mode. You'd plug it into a dock (with power, display and keyboard) to use it as a desktop; full office apps will be available. ---- In other words, it will disrupt consoles and desktops, as well as mobile devices.<p>laptopt/desktops/servers - just standard increases; they aren't crucial anymore since Apple is disrupting all of them. Rather than making ARM-based laptops etc, they will replace them with iPad-like devices.\nThe x86 processors will always be more powerful, and so far, this is still needed by people who buy desktops etc.",1316372379

3010967,comment,3009021,3010142,1,0,9oliYQjP,,,"Sports stadiums are never profitable. Tax payers in the municipalities where the stadiums are built pick up the losses in almost all cases, either during construction or when the team decides to just leave and holds them ransom for a new one.<p>2/3 of restaurants fail outright soon after opening. The other 1/3 tend to be profitable really quickly (running a restaurant is tough and you can't run it at a loss for very long). You'll see successful restaurant owners start another one within a few years, because the old one is starting to get stale to people. Besides, around that time usually the star chef decides to move onto something better too.<p>Dance clubs fall into a couple of categories IMHO. You have the smaller spots, which can and do thrive. They hold about a 100 or fewer people, are often started by one really savvy entrepreneur who just wanted to create a cool spot (sound familiar to hackers and OSS? :-P). Then you have the bigger spots. These are cavernous mega clubs, and in my experience they're often in one way or another linked to organized crime and/or money laundering. They'll garner a lot of attention through PR, celebrity sightings, and marketing, and eventually implode under a pile of debt. How you can pile up debt selling alcohol at $7 a shot and several hundred dollars a bottle, I'm not quite sure. Read about Peter Gatien, one of the more notorious club owners in North America. Jay-Z has rapped about him: ""Me and my operation, running New York nightscene, with one eye closed, like Peter Gatien"". The whole business is about shifting debt like a hot potato. It's disgusting.<p>Social businesses have a finite amount of time with which they are fashionable to the masses and under which their growth is distorted. That first explosive growth trend never repeats itself ever again, which is probably what Facebook is trying to contend with right now as it decides when to go public.<p>If I were Mark Zuckerberg... I'm clearly not anywhere as brilliant as he is... but if I were in his shoes, I'd take a page from other successful social entrepreneurs. Start something new that's cool and is not Facebook-branded. The trick to social businesses is that the entrepreneur should be the brand. Facebook should be a Zuckerberg product in the same way that 69 Royal Hospital Road is but a single Gordon Ramsay restaurant. Zuck should have a portfolio of social sites, not one fucking behemoth that, when it fails, takes him down with it.",1316372354

3010949,comment,3010345,3010665,1,0,pjscott,,,"I think your description of redis' reliability is a bit too vague and scary. There are several levels of reliability that redis supports, each with its own tradeoffs:<p>1. No disk. Everything in memory, and if redis dies, so does your data. This is closest to memcached.<p>2. In memory, with periodic background flushes to disk. After a timeout (shorter if there's a lot of modification to your data), redis will spawn a background thread and write out all its data to a file in the background. (Then it will atomically rename the file in the place of the previous dump file.) This is the easiest form of disk persistence, and good enough for most of what people use redis for.<p>3. You can also configure redis to write to an append-only file that logs every operation, which you can periodically compact with a cron job or something. The flushing interval is configurable, and makes a big difference in speed. This is not particularly convenient -- who the hell wants to write a cron job to compact database logs? -- but it gives you durability on par with a conventional database.<p>4. If you have another machine lying around, there's an option that you can combine with any of the three options above: master-slave replication. A read-only slave redis server receives a stream of all writes to the master, and changes itself to match. This gives a small data-loss window in the event of a master failure, and makes fail-over possible. If the master goes down, you can have a slave become the new master. Coordinating this can be tricky, but it can certainly be done.<p>tl;dr: If the reliability approaches above look good enough for your application, and redis looks like the best match from a semantic or performance standpoint, then go for it!",1316372057

The computation involved in keying media on the fly while it's being downloaded is not insignificant when considered in volume. The added pain of storing everyone's unique keys also discourages this behavior. At worst you'll see different keys being used by region or datacenter, or perhaps key rotation on a weeks-months scale.<p>Some media (both DRM and non-DRM) will be trivially unique because of metadata like purchaser info or music tags. In some cases this makes the first block unique but all later blocks are deduped, in other cases you need to be somewhat content aware so you can treat the header data separate from the real media data. This also allows you to catch a lot of data people ripped themselves using standard settings.<p><i>You can save on operating system and application files, but it isn't 60%.</i><p>While I agree that photos and videos will be the bulk of their problem, I don't think that ruins their premise.

So far I think this is democracy doing its job well. Thus established parties, like the ""liberals"" (FDP) and the Greens, have neglected topics like data privacy, net neutrality. The creation of a new party, like the Greens in the eighties and the Pirates in the aughts, is a drastic sign that the agenda needs updating.

1173992,comment,1172803,1172977,0,0,DaniFong,,,"According to Keynesian theory, government spending improves money circulation throughout the whole economy in a way very similar to how bypass surgery improves blood circulation in the whole body. If you distribute money to people who need it (generally, the unemployed,) they'll end up spending it on important services (the hope is) which will end up in the much needed pockets of those providing the sevices, who will spend it on much needed services, etc. Government spending is a mechanism for redistributing the wealth in a way that saving won't swamp, for the economy is a sociological phenomenon.<p>However, it is to be argued that distributing money randomly in public works isn't exactly the best way to handle it. The previously unemployed are not the most likely to build businesses to find sustained employment, to create wealth for the economy. Random public works are not so likely to create wealth for the public. There's the possibility to do much better; unfortunately the simplified Keynesian analysis doesn't capture this.<p>One example of a terrific project is microfinance. These loans give people a chance to create actual sustainable businesses. The loans are repaid at a rate of nearly 97.7%. What this shows is several things. The first is that the capital of microfinance can keep on giving. At this repayment rate, the capital can be given out 30 times before it's at half of the initial amount. There's thus a huge multiplier effect there. Furthermore, the repayment comes from the proceeds of the operation. Hence, in 97.7% of the cases, the businesses that are funded will keep on going -- another huge multiplier effect. On a giving basis, there aren't enough dollars in the world to solve poverty: with a system like this, there might be.",1267995393
1173991,story,,,1,0,philjr,"Ask HN: Sports footwear - distribution, shipping etc.",,"So, I play a bit of sports. And where I'm from footwear in particular is bloody expensive and selection is poor. Expensive isn't always the end of the world. I can always seem to hit eBay and buy myself a pair of footy boots or Nike Air Jordans for about half the price of what I pay here.<p>So, I say to myself, there's a potential market here. Hmmm, Maybe. I'd like to test the waters, but from what I can gather this is extremely difficult.<p>I'm interested in purely sporting goods, but I think this is applicable to any business where you dip into ""real products"" i.e. stuff you need to ship and this definitely falls out of the realm of my expertise.<p>I don't think this will end up an empire and to be quite honest, I'm more interested in serving a need and I'd like to use proceeds to help development in the various sporting organisations I'm part of.<p>First of all, my options seem to be:<p>- Buy stock. Stock++. Sell stock. Stock--. Ship. (I don't want to be in the stock business. Large up-front investment)<p>- Drop shipping. This seems in theory a brilliant idea, but seems difficult to find drop shippers in this particular market.<p>- On-demand orders. I could list items that I've sourced from other websites that ship to my country and essentially broker the sale plus markup. Ship to me, re-package and re-ship. It makes the shipping really long (and not forgetting customs headaches), but it seems like an ""easy"" way to start, but full of work.
- Be a pure aggregator. Put the customer in touch with the various sites, either broker the exchange or look at affiliation.

Culture shock develops slowly from the stress of being away from home and living in a strange land. You are long over people eating X or what ever, and then one day you're just sick of it all. Not exactly ALL of it, but you tend to fixate on the defects of the strange place you're in and you're in a perpetually bad mood, very similar to the stressed out shitty mood someone quiting smoking is always in.<p>Some of the points he makes are valid. There is lard in bread, I think that's MUCH better then the hydrogenated fats of margarine. Lard may not be good for you, but it is better then the alternatives.<p>And smoking is definitely bad for you. And as an European I feel that American corporate culture bleeds far too far into everyone's personal life, much like how the author feels about corporate partying in Japan.<p>The no-real friends thing also strikes me as something I can say about Americans, who from my perspective seem to have trouble forming deep adult friendships.<p>But the author and I have two options, get over it or go home.<p>The curious thing about culture shock is that it never strikes in the very first moments of awe when you just arrive. It takes a little while. But then you tend to get over it and then many months or some times years later it hits you again, and this time it is WORSE. And many immigrants/ex-pats never got over the second wave. They (we!) just end up pissed off at the host culture.<p>* <i>EVERY JAPANESE POP SONG IS ABOUT THE SAME THING</i> *

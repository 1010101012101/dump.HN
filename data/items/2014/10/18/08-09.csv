8474956,comment,8470206,8472939,0,0,HorizonXP,,,"Take Postgres for example. I use the official Docker image, and run it via a fleet .service file, having it store its data in a Docker data-only container, also launched from a fleet unit file. Finally, there&#x27;s a third unit file that runs a slightly customized version of the docker-register image from CoreOS&#x27;s polvi. This Dockerized app polls the Docker socket every 10s or so to get the IP and port information for the Docker container it&#x27;s monitoring, in this case Postgres. It PUTs this value into etcd.<p>Afterwards, when my Django containers start, they pull their configuration from etcd using python-etcd. It will get the IPs and ports for the services, including Postgres, from etcd, and configure itself using that. Finally, it will keep these values in a dictionary. If these values ever differ from what&#x27;s currently in etcd, then my Django app will send a signal to cause uwsgi to gracefully restart the Django app, so that it can reload itself with the new configuration.<p>For other Dockerized apps like nginx, I use kelseyhightower&#x27;s confd-watch to monitor the etcd keys I&#x27;m interested in. confd-watch is great because it will use golang&#x27;s text/template package to allow me to generate configuration files, like nginx.conf, with the values from etcd. So as these values get updated, so will nginx as confd-watch will force a graceful reload.<p>Hope that helps.",1413621973

E.g., in Haskell, I am fond of using `flip` to reverse two actual arguments just because it makes a line or 3 of code look nicer, and I cannot do that in Emacs Lisp -- or I can, but it involves adding additional lambda forms or calls to funcall or symbol-function (i.e., it involves too much rigamorole).<p>Since I cannot say exactly how far lexical scoping would go in making Emacs Lisp more like Haskell in this regard, this is only a partial answer to your question, but certainly, the lack of lexical scope has something to do with it.<p>Aside from the deficiencies I just mentioned around higher-order functions, I was surprised by how little the lack of lexical scope got in my way.

I do get where you&#x27;re coming from and I actually don&#x27;t care for musical notation; I can read it but I can&#x27;t sight-read to play so studying notes on a staff involves a lot of painfully keyboard pecking (or occasional cheat transpositions into a DAW) followed by a bunch of more fluid experimentation with the musical elements I played so badly, and it&#x27;s during this experimental phase that I may or may not learn something.<p>Like you I&#x27;d much rather read text about the psychology of musical perception and the <i>why</i> of music. I disliked the notation drills etc. when I had piano lessons as a kid, but as I never had a natural ear for chords or harmony (and thus frequently found myself wanting to improvise things but without a good understanding of how to go about it) I came back to the theoretical stuff as an adult, and ended up getting interested in other musical traditions like Arabic and Indian styles as well as the western one (though I don&#x27;t want to oversell my knowledge or skills here). Different traditions use different schemes but they all have some way to codify things, because unless you stay within a single tradition or are blessed with an eidetic memory chances are you&#x27;ll need to note things down at some point.<p>Where I&#x27;m disagreeing with you is on the terminologyl I hold that when people search for &#x27;music theory&#x27; it&#x27;s because they want to be conversant with other people on the basics, even if they just want the bare minimum of how to distinguish between major and minor, construct a few basic chords, or read/write a melody outside of a piano roll. It&#x27;s unfortunate that the label &#x27;music theory&#x27; has become associated with this basic stuff; it&#x27;s as if we used &#x27;literature&#x27; to refer to basic spelling, grammar, and vocabulary and used some other term to describe the actual study of artistic writing - but that&#x27;s how it is.",1413619530

To the point it&#x27;s creator was deeply disturbed and began to advocate against AI.<p>As time goes on, the AI effect kicks in. People get used to AIs and it takes more and more to impress or fooled by them. Once we get real human level AI, I expect people will treat them like they do in bad sci fi movies (for the probably short period of time they are our equals.) Just like people treat slaves and lower classes in other societies, not something you would form a relationship with.<p>But really we are nowhere near that point. Chatbots have gotten really advanced, but they are still basically chatbots.",1413619522

The engine is the canvas and the brush and the paints - but not the painter. Art is not a random linear combination of default assets no matter how many cycles you use for your rendering equation. You need a coherent grammar of visual presentation that is pleasing to the eye. The engine can facilitate this if you know what you want but it cannot make anything awesome by itself.",1413619243

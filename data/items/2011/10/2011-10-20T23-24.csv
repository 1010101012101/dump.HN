Fun to mess around with the first couple of days, but she hasn't used it once since.<p>Three problems:<p>1. AI Uncanny Valley. It's hard for her to know what's going to work and what's not. Things that seem like they should work, don't. It feels like it understands things sometimes, but obviously doesn't at other times. This makes the experience feel fragile and unreliable.<p>2. It's actually unreliable. The speech recognition is not quite good enough, and the connection/server issues were intermittently awful.<p>3. Robopsychology. My wife doesn't actually want everyone around her to know who she's calling or what she needs a reminder of, sort of for the same reason she leaves the room to take a phone call.

That is - the net position of the governement (savings-debt) was zero.<p>This didn't mean that there were no securities on issue - the need for an active market in government debt meant that there were still securities outstanding, but these were offset by liquid assets that could be sold to buy back the debt if necessary.  I don't know what the surplus money was invested in, but one of the leftovers from that period is a 'Future Fund' which is a very large pool of investment funds  held in trust for the future pension needs of the public service.  That is - the money was separated out from the general revenue pit and put aside to pay out the retirement benefits of the people employed by the government itself.  I do know that this fund is a diversified fund like any other, and invests in different styles and classes of securities.<p>Of course, a change in government since that period and a drop in revenues from the financial crisis means this is no longer the case.  But for that brief period it was a very good place to be - income tax rates were going down every single year and the economy had an unbroken 13 year period of real growth in wages and productivity.<p>You don't need public debt to function properly.  Australia is a perfect example of this.  In fact, a lack of public debt is a good thing as it allows a government to either return taxes via lowering tax rates, or invest the surplus for the inevitable rainy day, or, to build productive infrastructure if that is what they choose to do.",1319154910

</code></pre>
Shallow water drilling has been disincentivized in favor of deep water drilling for several years in part because of tourism and NIMBYism concerns. People do not want to see drills from the shore. This is well known in the sector.

  Through financial incentives, the House bill  encourages     
  states to allow offshore drilling. For drilling within 12 
  miles of their coastlines, the states collect 75% of all 
  royalties. They get 50% of all royalties for drilling up to 
  100 miles offshore. Louisiana, whose lawmakers authored the 
  bill, stands to collect an additional $50 billion over the 
  next 30 years. South Carolina, with no offshore drilling in 
  its history, has no idea of the potential payoff. The South 
  Carolina concern appears to be more turf protection by the 
  tourism lobby, and that includes Gov. Mark Sanford.

  South Carolina's $10 billion tourism industry could be 
  threatened, according to Sanford, *even though the state 
  could restrict offshore drilling to a distance more than 
  100 miles out*. The federal authority is demarcated at 200 
  miles out, and beyond that is open international waters.
</code></pre>
Notice: tourism concerns (and NIMBY issues, not mentioned in this piece) are cited as a reason to move drilling further offshore, in part by giving financial incentives (50% rather than 75% of royalties) for locating drills out of sight. Note also that Louisiana's lawmakers authored the bill. You can dig in more if you wish, but there were a variety of reasons why lawmakers preferred drilling further away from shores. And Republicans were just as culpable:<p><a href=""http://www.time.com/time/nation/article/0,8599,166334,00.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.time.com/time/nation/article/0,8599,166334,00.htm...</a><p><pre><code>  July 3, 2001

  ""Floridians have spoken loud and clear, and their voices 
  have been heard by President Bush,"" Florida Gov. Jeb Bush 
  said Monday after Interior Secretary Gale Norton announced 
  the administration would ask Congress to let oil companies 
  drill on about 1.5 million more acres in the Gulf of 
  Mexico. That's just a quarter of the roughly 6 million 
  acres that the Clinton administration first proposed 
  opening for leasing in 1997 and that the Bush/Cheney energy 
  plan had earmarked for drilling.

  Speaking from his parents' home in Kennebunkport, Gov. Bush 
  called the scaled-back proposal a victory for ""Florida's 
  fight to protect our coastline"" and told Bush the words 
  he's going to be hearing a lot for the next few years: not 
  in my back yard. ""Any lease sales that do occur in the 181 
  area""  a patch of energy-rich ground in the derrick-free 
  eastern part of the gulf  ""will occur off the coast of 
  Alabama, not Florida,"" he said.

  The newly proposed area extends to 100 miles south of 
  Mobile and gets no closer than about 200 miles west of 
  Tampa. That's actually OK with the folks in Alabama  they 
  already have plenty of drilling platforms out there, as 
  does most of the Gulf coastline stretching west to Texas. 

  And now it's OK with the folks  the Republicans, anyway    
  in Florida, who are worried about their white sandy beaches 
  and the mammoth tourism industry that grows on them.

  The compromise was made (and somehow you don't expect 
  Norton to be overruled later in the week) to appease the 
  state GOPers whom Bush offended late last month when he 
  came to Florida to strike an environmental pose at the 
  Everglades National Park with a bunch of Democrats.

  ...

  The plan allows Ari Fleischer to say the president's new 
  plan is ""environmentally sensitive and balanced"" (although 
  that's what they said about the old plan). It allows Jeb 
  Bush, up for a tough re-election in 2002, to imagine that 
  his brother's winning the presidency was actually a good 
  thing for him politically.
</code></pre>
Operative phrase: ""gets no closer than about 200 miles west of Tampa"". A series of bills and regulations like this, some of them simply interpretations, led to an overall incentive to locate platforms further and further away from the coasts, in uncharted waters.<p>Now, one can claim that tourism was a legitimate reason for these rules. Perhaps. But one must also concede that regulation was a nontrivial factor in forcing these platforms away from the shore.",1319154773

Were barriers to entry eliminated, unscrupulous companies could put unsafe cabs on the road and simply fold up shop and reincorporate when anything bad happened.<p>Ironically, the sky-high price of NYC medallions is a result of a free-market spin on taxi licenses: taxi permits in NYC can be freely bought and sold (like seats on a stock exchange).<p>Cities have experimented with taxi deregulation and the results have been mixed; in particular, taxi deregulation has been reported not to improve driver salaries.<p>It's also important to remember that street taxi service is not a particularly efficient market system. In the norms of the taxi market, you cannot in fact be choosy about what cab picks you up (even if you could, there's virtually no information available to you when a cab pulls up). It's thus hard to argue that street taxi competition would be that beneficial to consumers.<p>On the other hand, because the street taxi market is also characterized by lots of externalized costs (pollution, traffic, hit-and-run accidents, etc), one way consumers could conceivably benefit from ""competition"" among cab drivers would be to auction permits off, and <i>increase</i> the cost of entry to the taxi market.",1319153914

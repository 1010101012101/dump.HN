Bright? Hardly.  They're good at winning popularity contests, certainly.  Well-trained?  At what?  Amassing power?  The people most in charge of my life (ie, over a third of my labor) aren't trained in jack.  The guy at the top of the pile currently was a ""community organizer"", whatever the hell that is.  The guy in charge of the pile before him was another big government average kind of guy who had his success handed to him by his daddy.<p>So while I disagree with you as to the particular source of the problem for the last five years, I'm actually going to agree with you that overall human beings are bad at assessing systemic risk.  While I really admire Craig Venter, I'm extremely distrustful of someone with grand ideas of releasing designer micro-organisms into the environment.<p>I'm all for us pursuing designer micro-organisms, but we should clamp down hard on safety protocols.  I didn't read every line of the whole article (as someone else mentioned, the writing is pretty pathetic) -- but I didn't see any real text given over to the extraordinary danger of releasing organisms into the environment.<p>Really, I'd prefer if we restricted our organism construction for now to things that are big and can't really escape into the wild easily... say, that Woolly Mammoth project.  It's hard to lose track of a Woolly Mammoth.",1338400735

If there is a corresponding balance somewhere that isn't debited because you didn't spend it, then yes its sort-of the same.<p>But startups do not run that way. You might want to familiarize yourself with startup finances. They run on cash flow - and its all negative.  When investor dollars run out, everybody goes back to working for the man.<p>An example might make it clear.  If you compare spending $100,000 on a developer's salary vs $50,000 and stock, you might be fooled into thinking you've saved $50,000.<p>But there never was $100,000, at least not for salary.  Its a false comparison.  What you can really do is, either hire a guy for $50,000, or don't hire him.<p>If you hire him, you're getting another man-year of development done in the next year. But your out-of-cash-and-failing condition is brought $50,000 closer. Its a gamble - will that man-year of development get us to another milestone before the now-closer deadline of 'broke' arrives?  Who can tell - you just make your best guess and close your eyes, hope you found the right guy and sign the employment papers.<p>If you don't hire, then you spent $50,000 less, which means you can last longer but now depend upon the founders to get All the development done. While starving, neglecting their health and generally undergoing tremendous stress.  IF they can devote say half-time each (2 founders in the example given) then maybe its a wash (except for the suffering and depression part), cash-wise.<p>But there's also risk associated with being 1 year later to market.  Things change, your partner may change, your spouse may get fed up.<p>So, yes, when your Markov chain of money-events include 'broke' then it makes a very big difference whether you spend money or save it. Its all in the risk, time and stress equation, and involves probabilities that can be hard to estimate.",1338400599

4043860,comment,4040022,4040616,3,0,jleader,,,"It seems to me that A/B (or A/B/C/...) testing as described by btilly, and epsilon-greedy multi-armed bandit optimisation as described by Steve Hanov are two points on a continuum. In A/B/... testing, you're exploring 100% of your traffic, and eventually you declare the test ""done"", and start exploiting 100% of your traffic (sending it to the ""best"" slice). You have the advantage that during the exploration phase, your assignment of users to test slices is completely random, uncorrelated with anything else. In the epsilon-greedy approach, you're exploring with 10% of your traffic, and exploiting the current best-looking choice with 90% of your traffic. The trouble is that now 90% of your data is coming from one slice, and which slice it's coming from could vary over time. This means, as Ben points out, that your choice of slice could be 90% correlated with anything else that varies over time.<p>One approach would be to ignore the data from the 90% exploitation; that way, you only get 10% of the data, but its slice assignment is completely random and uncorrelated with anything else that might be happening. The trouble is that now you're running an A/B/... test on only 10% of your traffic, which means that it will converge 10x slower than if you were running it on 100% of your traffic.<p>However, it seems to me that the extra 90% of data that I've proposed ignoring isn't that useful, because it's only coming from one slice at a time. What you really want is to get more data from the slices you know least about. I suspect there are reinforcement learning algorithms that take into account not just the reward rate for each slice, but the current level of certainty with which the algorithm knows the reward rate, so it can collect more data about the slices it knows the least about, and stop collecting data about the slices for which it already has a fairly accurate reward estimate. The question is, are there such algorithms that can also handle non-stationary reward distributions? And how much tuning and tweaking do they require?",1338400034

I used to work in the nonprofit/philanthropy industry as a consultant, and many of my friends who worked at nonprofits would ask me to find grantmakers who might be interested in funding their nonprofit's programs. I currently provide clients a ""Funder Analysis"" and collect and analyze all the data by hand.<p>The idea behind the current site was to launch an MVP to test the demand for my product via online ads (I'm currently testing Google AdWords and have a small amount of organic search referrals) against the cost of hiring a developer to create a tool that would automate user input and analysis.<p>I'm looking for general feedback on the idea and the site, but could really use feedback on 1) specific design and content improvements I could make to the site and 2) ideas on how to market the product effectively and acquire paying clients.

They can't take a 1/3 cut from credit card processing.<p>They'll realistically take 2.75 - 3.5% and that would just piss off their developers who are being charged a 1/3, unless FB reduce their 1/3 cut - which I doubt they'd do.<p>Facebook would (probably) make more cash using FB Credits than processing credit cards - The margins are rediculously low with card processing (varies on card type) - It's game of volume.<p>Unless you're PayPal who charge you 2/3% for sending money between PayPal accounts. When all they're doing is ACH transfers between ""dynamic bank accounts"" they've setup, which costs them under 5 cents to preform.<p>= The trust factor = with Facebook (Guy/Girl's in Social Commerce take notice here).<p>Consumer's/Users whatever you want to call them simply would not trust Facebook with their super sensitive data (Credit Card & Billing Information). They don't have the best reputation when it comes to users data.<p>They might experience some success and sign up a few tech savy users - but ultimately - even if they sort out all of the technical & logistical issues they will constantly face this one.<p>This is why social commerce isn't full circle, or shouldnt be. When was the last time you entered your credit card details into a Facebook app? would you?<p>Social Commerce is really the discovery of products, but when it comes to facilitating the transaction, consumers need to be out of the ecosystem where ""public"" data is flowing, their friends are talking to them, or irrelevant social data is distracting them.<p>Consumers feel incredibily uncomfortable entering sensetive data into a platform which they use with the mindset of ""sharing"".<p>Unless of course it could be masked under a ""Pay by Facebook"" option which doesnt require the user to type in and sesntive information - ha.<p>Those are just my thoughts, and of course you have risk, disputes, charge backs, being the ultimate target for russian hackers etc.<p>I could be completly wrong, but I think a third party needs to step in here.<p>Facebook and a Dwolla/GoCardless partnership - now that would be intresting - you can fake a credit card but you cant fake a bank account.",1338398984

For instance Sweden once had a strong stance on matters of privacy but now all call records and IP records are stored in the Titan Traffic Database and warrant-less wiretaps are now possible through the FRA law but because of the vast amounts of data with both systems, the data is handed over to the US directly for signal processing (which may be a violation of EU privacy laws and UN Universal Declaration of Human Rights).",1338397454

People think it matters a lot in business because it matters in your day-to-day life with in-person interactions. The fact of the matter, however, is that many people who don't trust things still use them.<p>I don't trust my government, but I still pay my taxes and use the clean water they pipe to my house.\nI don't trust most banks, but I still use their CC processing networks.\nPlenty of people don't trust BP (and oil companies in general) but still drive internal-combustion cars.\nMore and more people every day don't trust Foxconn, but still buy all the gadgets they produce.<p>Trust matters when you are dealing with something non-ubiquitous; you don't need to use it, so if you don't trust them you don't use it. However, if something goes main-stream (like credit-cards), and the interaction is practically forced on you (like taxes) then people use it without trust. Facebook as it stands right now is testament to that. I don't trust them _at all_, but am forced to use it because friends, family, and groups I personally value use it in a way that requires me to as well.<p>If they launch a payment processing system that even only a quarter of their users are willing to use, that is enough market share for websites to start using it, which is free advertisement for the system, gaining more users. How long before sites that _only_ take facebook pay crop up (in the same way that some sites _only_ use paypal; a company plenty of people don't trust, but are forced to use)? How long before some site that provides a service that you depend on?",1338397433

The trick is prioritization, like the old saying goes: ""anyone with more than 3 priorities has no priorities.""  I have a 6 month old that I am very involved with.<p>The first few months was difficult by default due to the chaos.  But now that my wife and I are in a routine (and he is sleeping through the night), I am getting a lot done. Perhaps not as much ""work"" as before but what it has allowed me to do is get rid of everything that doesn't really matter and focus only on the things that do (ie, it makes me happy, it makes me money, self improvement, etc).<p>Mornings I typically get up with him and spend an hour or so playing with him, feeding him, etc.  My wife looks after him during the day.  When I get home from work I devote my entire attention to him and my wife. I take care of bath time. We split the feeding time before bed. Sometimes we spend time all together then, other times we each do the tasks at hand while the other feeds. After he is in bed we either spend time together and then work, or vice versa. A couple nights a week it is date time where we watch our favorite shows together or whatever and there is no work.<p>Am I busy? Hell yeah. But I make an effort to be effective with my time.  I use the web app Rescue Time to track my productivity. It at least quantifies my time at the computer.<p>Also, As far as freelancing, before I cut it out altogether, I simply raised my rates.  This gave me less freelance jobs but allowed me to earn more per hour. Wasnt making quite as much however I was a whole lot happier.<p>My point is that I agree that you need to put your family first, but feel you can live your dreams AND be a good parent if you simply remove everything that is not important.",1338397297

I don't intend to always do this but right now I have a reason I'm working on the open source project (Specific goal) so am doing it for now. When I first started I would literally spend 15 hours some days because I was trying to cram a lot of learning into a small period of time.<p>The personal project time is much more productive, the 8 hours of work, I guess, is questionable as to whether its ""Writing code"" as a lot is wasted wrangling with the legacy app I have to deal with, debugging old legacy code, etc but even though its writing less code I find it far more stressful than working on my own project where I am mainly writing code.<p>I don't advocate anyone work for an employer by spending more than 8 hours a day working unless you're being paid really well but when you work full time and want to get stuff done outside of work its inevitable that you have to spend extra time coding.",1323025138

Because world population has grown five-fold during the age of cars, we will be stuck with their legacy in roads and low-density metro configurations for at least the next century.

But neither the physics nor economics work out, and in fact will not work out until population density is much higher.<p>It is the ubiquity of roads, more than the greatness of cars that is difficult to defeat.  And so, the future of transportation is, perhaps disappointingly, simply better cars.  Our abstract criterion for the perfect transportation system is one that is fast, ubiquitous, has on-demand departure, and is quiet, private, and safe.  The solution to all of these is a self-driving car.<p>It is clear that a maglev based personal rapid transit elevated track system should not be pursued as a business.""""",1323025138

3311371,comment,3310873,3310992,21,0,kstenerud,,,"I just read the whole book. Here are my comments:<p>1. ""Pilgrims."" The author consistently makes comparative references to pilgrims to the American continent. This is disingenious.\nFor the homesteaders, the cost of expansion was very low. Their technological advantage allowed them to drive out the native inhabitants with relative ease. Their infrastructure requirements were minimal, but most importantly, there was fruitful land to be taken at very low cost.<p>Not so with seafaring. Your ""land"" must be planned and built up-front at substantial cost. Once you've built your ""land"", you're stuck with that design. You can't just take more ""land"", since it would require building an entire new platform, once again at substantial cost. What happens when your platform capable of supporting 1000 people can no longer support its growing population? Do you kick people off? Who decides who stays and who leaves? And who would be willing to live with the sword of Damocles over their heads, knowing that at some point in the future, they could be ousted by the council of elders, forced to leave their home and friends, to fend for themselves?<p>2. Maintenance. The author is very opposed to taxation, and yet the very nature of seafaring incurs substantial maintenance costs. Who will bear those costs? Who will collect the funds? How will you handle disputes over the taxation rate, or people who refuse to pay?<p>3. Wealth generation. This one was particularly poorly thought out. Tourism? The amount of space dedicated to tourism would have to be so huge to offset the living costs that I don't see this contributing in any meaningful way to economic surplus. Manufacturing dangerous goods? Space ports? Who would want to live near such places? All of the possibilities offered were of small economic value. Any balance of trade would tilt massively in favor of land based economies.<p>4. Expulsion. How and when do you expel members of the community? Do you write a set of laws, with the more severe prescribing exile? How about people who fall behind in their financial obligations (i.e. taxation) for one reason or another (for example, someone gets sick and can't pay their bills on their salary)? That works well for those on the top, but for those at the bottom of the totem pole, it would be intolerable.<p>5. Government. I realize that the author is a libertarian, but this worship of the ""corporate"" government as some sort of panacea is really naive. A corporation is a despotic form of government. Despotism is very well suited to small communities, but still suffers from the flaws of all governments: tyranny. Anyone who has spent time dealing with corporate politics will know how much it resembles swimming in shark infested waters. Political rot builds up, and is all but impossible to remove. Psychopaths make their way to the top and rule with an iron fist, making the company financially profitable, but a nightmare for those who work there.<p>6. War. The author glosses over arguments of war by hand waving that it might not be as bad as with historical autonomous governments, or that ""war drives away trade"". Historically, this has not deterred those who bear a grudge. Furthermore, outright armed conflict is unlikely to be the norm. Far easier to simply sabotage the rival platform, since damage to a sea platform is orders of magnitude more devastating than damage to land.<p>7. ""You can just leave if you don't like it."" This always makes me laugh. Leaving is not something simple like changing washing powder brands. Leaving involves uprooting your entire life, leaving friends & family, giving up all agreements, titles and numerous other intangible benefits, and then starting over with only whatever money you have in a new place where you don't know other people. The barrier is actually quite huge, especially when the community is small. It's even worse for people who are born on the platform, but don't agree with its politics. You know, just like libertarians who are born in a country but don't like its politics. You can always just leave, right?",1323024739

Advanced detection and defense systems could be put in place to warn of uninvited vessels approaching.  Remember piracy is a big deal precisely in those places least likely to have seasteads (why would someone build a resort, hospital, or tech incubator off the shores of Somalia?).<p>Natural disaster is of course and issue, but I don't know if the probability of natural disaster would be any higher on a  seastead versus on land.  Natural disasters frequently aren't natural at all, at least the consequences aren't.  Just compare the consequences of the Haiti earthquake versus Fukushima.  When there are incentives to protect property, it will be protected. The probability of a disaster is uncontrollable anywhere you live, the extent of devastation is controllable.",1323024702

3311317,comment,3309108,3310617,2,0,umarmung,,,"You are generalising and taking too much at face value.<p>I went to Oxbridge (not going to say which) for my first uni and also interviewed at several colleges, as well as many of my friends also going to Oxford or Cambridge.<p>1. Neither Oxford or Cambridge university have an open policy to discriminate against privately educated students. This is just a public perception due to political pressure. In fact, in the 1960s, 30% of domestic intake was from private schools, it is now holding at roughly 45%.<p>2. You are largely correct that you need better exam results if you're from a private school compared to maintained schools. But within that large group, you are actually differentiated mainly by your entrance exam (70% of all admissions), application and interview.<p>3. Oxbridge has no inate preference for diversity. Academic excellence in general matters far more:<p>i. Your first critical generalisation is that preferences are expressed from a university level. This is not the case. Every college has its own admissions office and select based on their own college preferences which vary significantly from college to college and can be surprisingly strong and consistent across time.<p>ii. Therefore, your resume matters far less than you think, depending on which college you apply to and even what subject. For example, for the most competitive subjects, the academic bar is extremely high and in the interview they will be looking for additional indications of the nature of this intelligence such as quick or lateral thinking as well as confidence of expression. For the least competitive subjects, the academic requirement is far more flexible and you can get in largely based on how well you fit in with that specific college's ethos or how much they value diversity.<p>4. Oxbridge DOES <i>effectively</i> discriminate, not on any illegal basis, but on your ""class"". Almost all Oxbridge students have a background from upper or upper middle/professional classes, even those from state maintained schools. It is rare to find lower middle or working class kids who go to Oxford. This is likely due to the heavy emphasis on education from an early age as well as the Oxbridge staff, culture and traditions all being from the same cut.<p>Since this tends to cover a large proportion of immigrant groups, this means you will rarely find such pupils at Oxbridge. For example, there was a notorious article that exactly ONE Black-Carribean student had been admitted to Oxford in 2009. Even the British Prime Minister got involved. Oxford vociferously denied this and said there had been 26 ""Black"" students out of 3,202.<p>5. As for Europe, I dare not generalise. This is especially the case since many European countries have lower proportion and diversity of immigrants as well as strongly integrationist rather than the multicultural policies of the UK and US. Also, difficulty of access to tertiary education tends to be much lower in Continental Europe because it is heavily subsidised publically. For example, many courses in many German universities are effectively free, even for foreigners. When things are that different, there's little point trying to compare directly on one specific issue.<p>===<p>So, Britain does not do ""tick box"" discrimination even for the most competitive universities. Quite the contrary, at least for Oxbridge, they will take academic quality even if that means sourcing from a monoculture. Only political pressure has stemmed the further reduction in state school access.<p>In short, you could say that Oxbridge is almost a perfect example of the minimum you could expect <i>without</i> legalised ""positive"" discrimination in a university system of a multicultural anglo-capitalist society.",1323023536

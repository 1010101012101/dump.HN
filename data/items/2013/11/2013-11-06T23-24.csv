6686513,comment,6684800,6686372,5,0,sillysaurus2,,,"... would you say the same about the Library of Alexandria?  What would you have suggested they do?  Not kept a library?<p>You should play some poker.  It&#x27;ll give a healthy respect for how much odds can affect outcomes.  Shocking situations will happen, but half the time you&#x27;ll be the one doing the shocking.  Often you can win with just a pair of 8&#x27;s.  Based on your attitude, it seems like you&#x27;d always choose to fold if you were only holding 8 8, but in reality it&#x27;s sometimes worth it to call.<p>Your expected value by not playing at all, though, is zero.  Meaning you won&#x27;t lose, but you won&#x27;t win either.  This only makes sense when you&#x27;re satisfied with your environment as it exists today.<p>I wouldn&#x27;t be satisfied without the internet archive.  It serves a vital function.  They may be gambling against natural disasters, but you know what?  They&#x27;re still winning.  And by choosing to play, they&#x27;ve improved our world a bit.  We should be grateful, not scornful.",1383782391

Arguing about that (or focusing on it) misses the real point about how they&#x27;re different from a lot of government agencies, which has everything to do with why they&#x27;re acting grabby about IP like a business.<p>As the Wikipedia article notes, since 1971 it&#x27;s been a corporation-like independent agency that&#x27;s essentially unsupported by taxes. Since then it was supposed to operate in the black and it did for a long time, until it got hit by increased competition in traditional delivery services, digital communications... and the Postal Accountability and Enhancement Act of 2006 (which both keeps it from offering new &quot;non-postal&quot; services and gives it new obligations like prefunding healthcare obligations 75 years into the future).<p>I don&#x27;t think treating zip or other geoinfo they&#x27;ve got as proprietary is a great idea, because it could be used to create a lot of value if it was let out on its own. But the value it has makes it a potential revenue source, and given the obligations and limited options they have, I can understand why they feel like they&#x27;d have to capture some of the value they&#x27;ve created.",1383782270

Every time they release a new piece of hardware is cause for a face-palm.<p>15 years ago, when no console maker had a viable strategy for going online, MS should have built a cross platform solution that made online gaming possible for every console. Does that sound familiar? A cross-platform solution for a number of competing hardware makers?<p>This division would probably be a huge part of Microsoft&#x27;s business if they had pulled it off. Just think of the leveraging possibilities if every gamer over the age of 25 had an XBox live account, instead of the much smaller subset of gamers over 25 who also owned a Microsoft console.<p>I think they&#x27;re back on the right track with Windows phone, but Google already beat them to the cross-platform solution.",1383782264

ZIP codes are (collections of) delivery routes.  You can then reverse engineer a map more-or-less from the collections of addresses in a ZIP code, but it&#x27;s messy and not necessarily meaningful.<p>If post offices were as plentiful as they are in (say) Manhattan, ZIP codes are a good proxy for location.  If you live outside a major city, not so much.  My parents live about 15 miles from the post office from which their ZIP code derives; my house used to be about a half mile from its post office, but that one was shut down (for mail delivery -- still exists for PO boxes), so now I&#x27;m attached to a ZIP code for the post office two towns over.<p>This matters, because if you do any sort of map-business off of ZIP codes, instead of political boundaries, the results are crap.<p>So death to ZIP codes.",1383782061

There&#x27;s a good deal of magic involved, and passages in the documentation even state stuff like &#x27;there are a couple of these magic variables, but not too much&#x27; (Note: No list is provided).<p>In general I hate the state of the documentation. It&#x27;s barely usable.<p>I do like the simplicity of the format (.yml) and the architecture (no agent required, only dependency is python and I think even that can be bootstrapped via python).<p>My playbook (see above) certainly feels like a shell script packaged in .yml format, but .. I stumbled over and over again when I tried using ansible&#x27;s modules (examples: No way to create postgresql roles without a password, no way to load data into postgresql => Two things I&#x27;ve to do via shell: or command: in my project).<p>Bottom line: I&#x27;m happy with the state I have, but I&#x27;m far from happy with ansible as a technology and probably wouldn&#x27;t use it as it is for the next deployment project.",1383781456

Ignoring high energy (not .22 rimfire) rifles (can address that later if you wish), for normal handguns in  self-defense, what police and civilians can legally do is stopping a lethal threat.  Killing is not and cannot be the objective.<p>And there&#x27;s basically three mechanisms for that, only one of which is reasonably guaranteed to work with normal human marksmanship.<p>First, when shot once, a large fraction of people will stop their aggression, e.g. Trayvon Martin is the most recent famous example.  For that matter being shot <i>at</i> is often sufficient (browse YouTube some).  But you obviously can&#x27;t count on it.<p>Hitting the central nervous system, brain, or spine high enough, will do it.  But those are small, hard to hit targets, we have strong instincts about threats to our heads, the brain is well protected with bone, etc. etc. ... and of course a hit to the brain is often fatal and almost certainly catastrophic.<p>Failing that, causing someone to lose enough blood they can&#x27;t keep fighting is what you&#x27;re left with---but that&#x27;s dicey, there are many many incidents where e.g. heart function is outright stopped and the aggressor continues to be lethal for 10s of seconds to in some rare cases minutes.  And this mechanism is obviously also hard to keep from going all the way to fatal.<p>One very special case for police snipers is the hostage situation where they have to hit the perpetrator&#x27;s brain stem to prevent him from reflexively killing his hostage.  That&#x27;s invariably lethal (killed JFK), but still based on the, in this case, narrow legal distinction that the intent was to stop the perpetrator from killing a innocent 3rd party, not kill him <i>per se</i>.<p>Ah, I should add the deterrent affect.  Being maimed or killed by a civilian is about the greatest fear of criminals according to surveys; the fact that the civilians will be using lethal guns is of course behind that.  From that it logically follows that the <i>vast</i> majority of the 2.5 million gun self-defense incidents in the US every year do not involve anyone getting shot, and almost always even a shot being fired (warning shots are pretty much never legitimate).",1383780641

Stat #3: As more people buckled on helmets, brain injuries also increased. Between 1997 and 2011 the number of bike-related concussions suffered annually by American riders increased by 67 percent, from 9,327 to 15,546, according to the National Electronic Injury Surveillance System, a yearly sampling of hospital emergency rooms conducted by the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC).&quot;<p>>&quot;Of course, concussions are more readily diagnosed now than they were 15 years ago. That likely accounts for some of the increase. It&#x27;s also possible that some of the 149 fewer riders killed every year survived to get lumped into the brain-injury category. But that still leaves thousands unaccounted for. We&#x27;re left with this stark statistical fact: The concussion rate among bicycle riders has grown faster than the sport.&quot; //<p>So, yes 9327 -> 15546 is a 67% increase and as they rightly say the increased survival rate contributes as does the improved diagnosis.<p>>&quot;that still leaves thousands unaccounted for&quot; //<p>Except they already said that daily commuting had increased over years 1995 to 2009 by 60%.

What is well known is that they operate on a wide &quot;portfolio&quot; of products and services since there are strong dependencies between them. Drugs, weapons, bank robbery, ATM stealing, truck robbery, kidnapping... the list is long.<p>Drugs is a relevant LOB because it employs a great deal of terror on the human structure of the organization. Debt with a drug dealer is usually seen as a death sentence. So the dealer knows he can manipulate those who cannot pay their debts by forcing them to commit various crimes as compensation. Dealers don&#x27;t need money to finance crimes, they do it mostly through terror. Drugs are just the foundations.<p>Black market. If the legal drug is sold for $15, drug dealers would sell the same amount for $10. Like the do with stolen medical drugs sold mostly in slums.<p>Government/private companies would have a hard time trying to sell legal drugs anywhere near slums. Not only the dealers would exterminate the workers of those places, but would also steal the products to resell them.<p>I&#x27;m pro drug decriminalization. I believe people should be free to experiment anything they want in their lives, of course, being properly accountable for that.

I don&#x27;t believe that.<p>Can you demonstrate ?<p>I&#x27;m making a device, it doesn&#x27;t matter which kind, rocket or car, or what it does. Why don&#x27;t you give me a plan to allocate production of this device. Of course, it has to apply to all possible devices, rockets, boats, cars (fisher-price and the regular kind), ... Since you say this decision can be made intelligently without domain knowledge, there must be a general solution.<p>As an AI aficionado, I am EXTREMELY interested in this solution and I can personally guarantee this to you : If you have even a basic (but non-trivial) beginning of a plan that actually works, I&#x27;ll make sure you get the Fields medal at least 5 times, or 1000 billion dollars, because a discovery of that magnitude absolutely merits such a reward, and the money would be easy pickings with such an algorithm. Hell it&#x27;d be rather easy to become the leader of a robot empire that easily defeats the US and every other nation on earth if you have such a solution.<p>But frankly I expect that you&#x27;re bullshitting. Out of the dozens of lunatic proposals I&#x27;ve received from various sources, from students to foul-smelling people I&#x27;d never seen before (or again), they at least mentioned the method they claimed would work. None were even remotely workable. You just claim that &quot;some people have learned it&quot;. I disagree in the strongest possible manner. Please, please convince me wrong. If it can be learned, it can be taught : so teach us, right here in this thread if it does indeed exist.<p>I claim these people who have learned &quot;allocation&quot; have not learned a thing. If they did, capitalism (a learning algorithm itself) could never possibly win against communism or dictatorships (because one of them would have had a leader that got allocation right). Instead, manager success is attributable, exclusively, to either the skills of the people they &quot;allocated&quot; and got things done (usually by undoing at least some allocation decisions), some external factor (it is no great feat for a microsoft product manager to build a program used by 500 million people due to monopoly), or shear dumb luck. Oh right, there&#x27;s also bribery and nepotism to account for management positions (as opposed to success).<p>This sort of arguments makes the ideas behind software development methodologies make much more sense. Especially scrum, but agile before it and others seem to be highly focused on taking allocation decisions out of the hands of people with this &quot;allocation&quot; &quot;skillset&quot;, like managers and project managers and the like, and into engineer&#x27;s hands by moving them into systems the engineers control.<p>I would also like to add that, in the business article/book way of saying things, &quot;most&quot; successful companies, from Ford, over Microsoft to Google, became successful and grew when &quot;allocation&quot; of resources was effectively not done at all in these companies. Especially human resources that brought these companies their big wins were often going against management decisions (or management was giving them 20% time. Except of course, they spent a lot more than 20% on it).",1383779405

Basically, your idea (which boils down to an FIR scaler) samples the entire image when resampling. That isn&#x27;t a very good behavior, IMHO.<p>EDIT: fixed math",1383778852

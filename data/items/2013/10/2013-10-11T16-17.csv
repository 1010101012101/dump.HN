SRAM memory is still used in a lot of devices where speed is more crucial than capacity. The most prominent use of SRAM is in the cache memory of processors where speed is very essential, and the low power consumption translates to less heat that needs to be dissipated.</i><p>In any case, SRAM can be more power hungry that DRAM (per bit) but it can also be vastly less. SRAM power consumption is not at all driven by the fact that registers are &quot;continuously powered&quot;. Accessing SRAM is the power hungry operation, but powering requirements otherwise are negligible. If anything, it&#x27;s the DRAM that requires constant powering (refreshing).",1381510466

6534304,comment,6532985,6532985,1,0,realrocker,,,"Perception is everything while learning a skill. Recently, I taught the Go programming language to a bunch of non programmers(mostly from arts and design background). The things I skipped talking about were the history of programming, the place of Go in the world of programming and consciously ignored questions similar to, &quot;How difficult is this?&quot;, &quot;How much time this will take?&quot; The idea was to teach a programming language with a sense of a planar plateau of difficulty for everyone in the room. I tried to develop the perception of  programming as a non-elite skill. The results were surprising. Most of the students picked up the language fairly well and went to write their own apps without any guidance. One guy remarked, &quot;This is like carpentry&quot;. I don&#x27;t understand his reasoning behind the remark but I can infer that as soon as the aura around programming was removed, students responded with much greater understanding. This approach was polar to my earlier methods of trying to ignite a fire of passion in the students by elucidating the complexities and charms of programming. The previous approach was successful too but I had a feeling that I was preaching only to the converted. Now whether natural aptitude is a factor in learning a programming skill is highly suspect. Even if a learner has exceptional natural aptitude(i.e. the X factor gene) he might be living in ghastly social circumstances with unknown effects. Except documented medical conditions there might be no link of learning on natural aptitude. The point is that there is far too less data supporting it.",1381510387

That&#x27;s a very nave view and one that I wouldn&#x27;t expect from TBL. The open web, as a marketplace, is already universal in that it can contain anything.

Another direction of history I&#x27;d like to compare this to is the unification of humanity.<p>No matter what our opinions on globalization, or diversity of cultures are, the humanity is inevitably moving towards one culturally homogeneous world. This may not seem obvious if we look at history on the scale of a few centuries, but it becomes apparent if we look at our entire history as species. We started with tens of thousands of completely separate &quot;worlds&quot; that had nothing to do with one another, and slowly, through trade and money, religion and imperial expansions we have become a single &quot;world&quot; without a single completely independent culture left on Earth. Slowly we are also all agreeing on moral and political values, such as &quot;democracy&quot;, &quot;human rights&quot; or &quot;equal opportunities&quot; (incidentally, values spread across the globe by western imperial expansion). If you want to object that there are still tons of cultures left that are all so different, that&#x27;s simply not true. Can you imagine Indian cuisine without chili peppers? Or the Russians/Irish without potatoes? Or the Italians without tomatoes? The whole world smokes, no culture openly accepts slavery, and so on, and so forth. And all these things and ideas were introduced just in the past few centuries, an almost negligible amount of time compared to the rest of our history.<p>Anyways, so the idea of openness of information, free data, etc. definitely seems to be a similar force. Again, if we look at the evolution, for most of our history we lived in small bands where privacy was non-existent, the ability to gossip was what gave us a major evolutionary advantage over other species. Still, even today most of things we spend our time talking about is pure gossip (just think about the proportion of HN articles about the &quot;celebrity&quot; programmers going to this or that company). So this idea of privacy, secrecy, etc. is something very new and I guess only the history can show whether it&#x27;ll stick or not (as you conjecture).",1381508267

Cult leader, maybe not, but his ego is visible from the ISS, and his narcissism is fairly hard to miss as well.<p>Likewise Assange is certainly intermingled with harm/death to Americans, if not directly involved. He claims there are higher reasons such as his effort to foist transparency on the U.S. government in particular, but you don&#x27;t leak hundreds of thousands of diplomatic cables and still end up Doing No Harm.<p>Additionally it was Assange&#x27;s mistakes that left the archive of unencrypted unredacted documents on a public web server in the first place. The Guardian journalist should have been just fine to publish the password years after the fact as the FTP share used to push the documents to the journalists doing the analysis was not required to be public for years! So again, although Assange is not &quot;the sole gunman&quot; here he does share in the responsibility.<p>And all of this now reaches back into why it might be appropriate to describe Assange with cult-like descriptives. You ask a U.S. Democrat and they&#x27;ll probably be able to list at least 5 things they don&#x27;t like about a prominent Democratic politician. Even a Republican would be able to list faults with their politicians.<p>But to hear people describe Assange, he is almost <i>literally  perfect</i>, has never done something wrong, makes snap decisions that are revealed to have been 100% beneficial years later, and never suffers from normal human misunderstanding or flaws in decision-making. Where does this come from?? I screw up something at least twice before breakfast every day, but any fault people point out with Assange must be as part of a vast government and media conspiracy to discredit him?

Wait, Microsoft makes chairs? No, not directly. But the part of that chair? Manufactured in facilities running on, you guess it, Microsoft software.&quot;<p>Let&#x27;s look at this statement. &quot;sitting in a chair made by Microsoft&quot;. It&#x27;s pretty clear what &quot;made by Microsoft&quot; should mean, shouldn&#x27;t it? What do you think when I say &quot;a smartphone made by nokia&quot;? You surely think that the smartphone was manufactured in a facility that may or may not used some software from nokia, right?<p>So my issue with that article is very misleading language. Can I call it newspeak?<p>So &quot;made by microsoft&quot; means neither made by microsoft nor does it mean made with sotware made by microsoft. It means it was made in a facility that may or may not uses an operating system made by microsoft. Who actually made the chair is an ingenieur using software not made by microsoft but that for <i>reasons</i> decided to target the microsoft operating system.<p>And these <i>reasons</i> are not something anyone at microsoft should be proud about. They worked really hard at disabling their competition with unethical methods. It&#x27;s not exactly secret, anyone can read about their history:

Is it not bad that fucking hospitals and their instruments &quot;run on&quot; proprietary closed source microsoft software? Again, this was achieved by becoming a (quasi-) monopolist by methods described in the links above.<p>&quot;were only able to do so because of generations of Microsoft leadership in technology.&quot;<p>What gets me is the casual tone that (as I read it) sounds like microsoft had &quot;generations of leadership in technology&quot; on their own merits instead of because they disabled their competition by their business behavior.<p>&quot;I run our Bing for Schools program. It gets hardware in the hands of kids, teaches them digital literacy skills, and creates a safe environment for them to practice in. And when we launched, the haters emerged from the woodwork with pitchforks and torches, growling Google!  Google! Just for fun, see the comment stream on The Verge story:  Microsoft offers classrooms free Surface RT tablets with ad-free Bing for Schools&quot;<p>Again, as others have said. It&#x27;s cool that children are introduced to technology. It&#x27;s bad that it&#x27;s proprietary technology. Especially at educational institutions. When I advocate that they get android tablets instead it&#x27;s not because it&#x27;s from google but because it is (mostly) free and open source. Meego/Sailfish OS/Firefox OS would be fine too. But getting taught proprietary microsoft software, possibly with their first contact to this technology? No.<p>&quot;But think about the number of young people who make a face when you say Microsoft. Thats an entirely different problem.&quot;<p>Why is that a problem? Sounds totally healthy to me.<p>&quot;Because even if you know that you are working on something that will help save lives&quot;<p>Actually you don&#x27;t do that. You are working on something that others will build something for that will save lives. And because you work for someone who has become a quasi monopolist with unethical behavior those others will have to give a lot of money to your employer even though without you we may or may not had a world running on free and open software by now.<p>&quot;or make things better for humanity&quot;<p>Again, look at the list of lawsuits microsoft was in and lost. And that&#x27;s only the stuff that is actually illegal, there is a lot you can do that is not illegal but still unethical.

I personally don&#x27;t see how anyone that thinks stuff like &quot;know that you are working on something that will help save lives or make things better for humanity,&quot;, i.e. who has a heart and a conscience can work for Microsoft.
I&#x27;m sure the working conditions aren&#x27;t as bad as some people say and the products aren&#x27;t as bad as people say either. For example the metro interface: I don&#x27;t really see why microsoft thought it was a good idea, but I could certainly work with it with no problems if I wanted to. It&#x27;d be only a little bit annoying but as someone who has no problems with fluxbox/openbox, xfce4, gnome2, gnome3, kde4 etc. it&#x27;d be no big deal.<p>The thing is that it&#x27;s not just microsoft, they &quot;support&quot; a whole industry intentionally or coincidentally designed to lock you in: Adobe Flash DRM, while atrocious, did work on linux. But it wasn&#x27;t &quot;good enough&quot; or something. The media industry had to choose microsoft technology with silverlight. Result: netflix, lovefilm, ... only (officially) work on either microsoft windows or apple&#x27;s mac os, both commercial proprietary operating systems.",1381507315

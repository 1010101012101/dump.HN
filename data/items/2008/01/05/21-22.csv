Ultimately, the hardest part was syntax highlighting on the current line, because you had to monitor input to figure out when a ""token"" had been completed, and then do the corresponding magic.  Dealing with the idiosyncrasies of changing colors and maintaining cursor position makes this a real bitch.<p>Turning off syntax coloring on the active line definitely makes the problem easier.  Wish I would have thought of that.  Strange how you can spend days on a problem but never think of the ""easy"" solution.",1199568601

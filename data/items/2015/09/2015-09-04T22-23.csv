Your charge may exist in the merchant&#x27;s database but not post to your online banking for several hours. Or it may be a wildly different amount - i.e. gas stations will place a $100 hold on your debit card and it will stay that way for days until it&#x27;s settled for the actual (lesser) amount. If you were accidentally double-charged, than rather than processing a separate refund, the merchant may simply not settle the duplicate charge, and it will drop off your pending transactions... eventually. The lag time may be several days or weeks. If it&#x27;s a debit card, you can&#x27;t spend the money during that time and you may be temporarily broke because of it.<p>If you make an ACH transfer, money will disappear from your account one night, spend a business day in the aether, and then post to the recipient&#x27;s account on the third day. The system is in inconsistent state (i.e. money is missing) for at least a day, possibly a whole weekend.<p>The actual transaction is settled and goes into &quot;posted&quot; state with a lag of 2.5 * 10^8 ms - i.e. 3 business days.

10173193,comment,10171942,10173022,0,0,mjb,,,"Those are fundamentally different things. Sharding is a scaling strategy for reads, writes and data size. It doesn&#x27;t address durability (which many distributed databases do). It doesn&#x27;t address the discoverability problem of how you know which piece of data is where (easy if you have a well-distributed natural key, potentially difficult if you have a poorly distributed natural key, potentially obscenely difficult if you don&#x27;t have a natural key). It doesn&#x27;t address data locality (it can, but then you need to migrate keys, and end up with a second-order &#x27;which key is where?&#x27; problem). Most crucially, it doesn&#x27;t address what you need to do if you have to do transactions (of any kind) across shards. You can try invent something to do that. You may get it right (probably using consensus or 2PC), or you may get it fundamentally wrong. Either way, it&#x27;s a tricky problem.<p>Sharding is good, for sure. It&#x27;s not a replacement for this kind of technology.<p>Aphyr is doing great work keeping vendors honest, and making sure they live up to their marketing.

10173188,comment,10171942,10172581,0,0,antirez,,,"Every time the topic of consistency in distributed systems arise I see this idea mentioned in a way or the other that the problem is how hard strong consistency is. To be honest is a problem solved a long time ago by consensus algorithms: there is a lot more work to do in the future in order to explore other useful consistency models, but if you want strong consistency you know you have &quot;just&quot; to use a consensus algorithm like Paxos or Raft or Viewstamped replication or whatever, and you end with a CP system. Of course it is <i>non trivial</i> even to implement those systems correctly, but the point is, most implementations tested by Aphyr don&#x27;t attempt to do this at all most of the times.<p>There will be bugs but in the end if your goal is to write a consistent store, you can do it. Bugs in wanna-be CP systems and/or failed attempts at implementing CP because of home-made protocols with flaws are part of the issue and part of what Aphyr&#x27;s research uncovers, but IMHO the central point is a different one: CP systems have performance limits so many real world systems don&#x27;t even try to be CP, which is fine, it&#x27;s up to the designer to pick the DB design and tradeoffs, but <i>you need to document it properly</i>. What happens during partitions? What consistency model the system employs if it does not feature strong consistency? Is the system Available during partitions? And so forth. As long as the documentation is honest, it&#x27;s up to the user to understand, for its use case, if the system is a good fit or not.<p>What we are seeing often is an attempt to informally document what should be well specified. Sometimes there are also incorrect things stated in bold letters in the documentation, like &quot;the system is consistent but sacrifices partition tolerance&quot; which does not mean anything in the context of partitions actually happening in the real world.<p>Aphyr&#x27;s effort and our collective effort as people working, implementing and using databases, in my opinion, is not to end with databases designed all the same way or all providing strong guarantees, but with clear understandable and honest documentation describing the system behavior.",1441406734

It seems like a more sophisticated customization tool, that you could leave aside for later? The IDL itself is pretty clear, and although I&#x27;d thought about (eg) java classes as defining a schema, I hadn&#x27;t made the connection that IDL (as from CORBA) also do that.<p>(1). RPC format. I&#x27;m familar with OO serialization and schema languages (unfinshed PhD, book chapters, a library and business), but less so for RPC - so maybe I&#x27;m off-base here.  And standards - even nascent standards - may be worth complying with. But why not omit the meta stuff, and make it even simpler:<p><pre><code>  {
    &quot;stackhut/web-tools&quot;:
    {
      &quot;renderWebpage&quot;: [&quot;https://stackhut.com&quot;, 711, 393]
    }
  }
</code></pre>
I&#x27;m really just wondering if there&#x27;s a strong reason for the meta data. It can be helpful to orient the reader, but here it is clear from context - the keys and how it&#x27;s being used. Maybe there are other optional fields you sometimes need?<p>But... for your use-case, perhaps it doesn&#x27;t matter that much, as the bindings hide it from users (but the point of text protocols is human readable, eg for debugging; so the simpler the better). You could use XML, or a binary protocol.<p>(2). JSON by example: This is my great idea for JSON schema, which I&#x27;m amazed no one has done yet: instead of another meta-format, do it by example:<p>Because JSON primitive values are typed, you can use a value to signify type. An object therefore also implicitly defines its type (like a java class). For example, the above JSON can also be used as a schema, because it indicates the two nested objects required, and the types of the primitives (string, number, number). Though I suggest a convention of using &quot;&quot;, 0 and false as values.<p>Those zero values help convey that it&#x27;s a type, not a value. It&#x27;s temping to want to encode information in the value itself (as opposed to the type), such as a default value - but that maybe a mistake, because there is so much more than can be done with strings than with numbers. Keep it super simple.<p>[ Arrays are usually not fixed-length, enabling the next trick to encode optional values and polymorphism. ] The JSON spec allows duplicate keys: so you include the same key with different types for all the polymorphic types. Specifically, you include the null value to indicate it is optional. e.g. version is an optional string:<p><pre><code>  {
     &quot;version&quot;: &quot;&quot;,
     &quot;version&quot;: null
  }
</code></pre>
This is a bit dodgey, because all JSON parsers simply return
one value if duplicate keys are found. You need to write your own parser. But it <i>is</i> valid JSON - and more importantly, it <i>looks</i> like valid JSON. That&#x27;s the key idea of &quot;by example&quot; - it looks like what it represents; there&#x27;s minimal cognitive leap from type to instance.<p>It&#x27;s rare to want polymorphic primitive types (e.g. string and number), so this is more for polymorphic objects. Unlike the common trick of a &quot;type&quot; field for nominal polymorphism, this is structural polymorphism - where only the different fields distinguishes types. NB: there are some tricky cases here, when the fields overlap, and I&#x27;m not sure that client code would want to mess with it.<p>Finally those non-fixed length arrays: polymorphism is represented by the types of a set of values in the array. In other words, the values aren&#x27;t ordered, but just represent the permissible types. eg:<p><pre><code>  [
    { &quot;image_url&quot;:&quot;&quot;, &quot;width&quot;:0, &quot;height&quot;:0 },
    { &quot;text&quot;: &quot;&quot; },
    { &quot;link_url&quot;:&quot;&quot;, &quot;link_text&quot;:&quot;&quot;}
  ]
</code></pre>
That&#x27;s a schema for an arbitary-length list that can contain instances of those three types of objects, with those mandatory fields, of those primitive types.<p>NB: for a schema of the RPC &quot;header&quot; above, the fixed length array schema represents a fixed length array - a special case.<p>(3). primitive datatypes: This idea can be extended, in a second level, with explicit primitive datatypes - this is the next level of schema power that everyone wants. Every value is now a string, and looks something like: &quot;url&quot;, &quot;date&quot;, &quot;email&quot;, and then gets closer to XS, with ranges like &quot;int:1..31&quot; and even those ridiculous regex defining valid values (great idea, awful in practice, like the regex for email). The key thing is it still is JSON and <i>looks</i> like JSON, since the datatype specification language is just a JSON primitive value (string), and the syntax and meaning is obvious and familar.<p>BTW minor typo on your website: s/intergrated/integrated/ (like integer)",1441405168

Applying such a tough standard amounts to very strong status quo bias.</i><p>Sorry I wasn&#x27;t clear.  I wasn&#x27;t making that statement as a &quot;justification&quot; for not implementing UBI.  It was about how it&#x27;s being &quot;sold&quot; politically.<p>Personally, if I were to push for UBI, I&#x27;d tell people that the only realistic way we can afford it is if we all agree to take a hit in standard-of-living.  I don&#x27;t have irrefutable proof but that&#x27;s what I think will have to happen.  However, it doesn&#x27;t necessarily we shouldn&#x27;t do it.  With the mass effects of citizens avoiding low-wage jobs, maybe it&#x27;s better for society that Walmart is open 6 days a week 9am to 7pm instead of 24/7 and for Amazon-Prime to scale back to 1-week delivery instead of 2-day, etc, etc.    Or Amazon-Prime costs $199/year instead of $99.<p>If sophisticated dynamic equations show that middle & upper class will have to &quot;suffer&quot; a bit to provide the entire country a UBI... fine.  But sell it that way to them and let everyone have open eyes going into it.  I&#x27;m skeptical that we can fund UBI just by renaming existing govt assistance programs so that it ends up being virtually &quot;free&quot; to taxpayers.",1441404025

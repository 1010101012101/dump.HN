130505,comment,130405,130405,0,0,nostrademons,,,"I certainly couldn't handle it - I didn't finish any of my independent projects until I got out of college.  Like you said, I couldn't really give them the concentration they required when I had to worry about classes, homework, activities, eating, friends, parties, etc.  Day was just too broken up.  And you can't code a startup on an hour here and an hour there.<p>Same problem occurs after you get a day job, but to a lesser extent.  The nice thing about employment is that once you go home at night, your time is yours (or should be), so you don't have any homework or studying that you should be doing.  You're still limited to 2-3 hours/day of decent worktime, and that's still not enough to really start a company, but at least you can concentrate decently on it.<p>I'd recommend that you finish college, get a job at a software company for 1-2 years, and then do the startup.  A job will let you see the sorts of problems that people are willing to pay for (they're usually more difficult than you imagine in college), and get you in the habit of writing code all day.  And it'll show you what the alternative is, for the rest of your life, if you don't make the startup fly.  You might even pick up some technical skills.<p>If you're really really passionate about computers - enough that you just can't concentrate on class - then I'd suggest dropping out, going to work for someone now, and starting a company a couple years down the line.  I have a couple friends that took that route and their careers don't seem to have suffered for it at all; in fact, they seem to be doing better than others their age (namely me ;-)) because they didn't waste 4 years on something they weren't really into.  But since you phrase it as ""nearly impossible to work on my startup on days that I've been in class"" instead of ""nearly impossible to work in class on days that I've been working on my startup"", I doubt this applies to you.<p>Do try some smaller open-source projects though, stuff you can do in a weekend.  Or work on someone else's open-source codebase.  That stuff looks really good on a resume, and you'll pick up some really useful skills.",1204807802

130502,comment,130191,130357,0,0,Tichy,,,"I guess Google can get away with it, because they are Google?<p>I understand vendors not wanting to give away their revenue, but in this case, I am not the person buying the hammer, I am the person who gave the hammer to the store to sell. So it seems to me at least telling me the percentage of revenue share would be fair. Then I would have to trust them on how much they sold it for, or, if things went bad, I could audit them.<p>With the way they do it now, they could make a million dollars off my game and never give me a penny. It just doesn't seem fair. And it is not like things like that have never happened before, think about all the bands that were ripped off by record labels. So is it really a good idea to trust here?<p>I have heard complaints about AdWords, too, although I forgot the details, did not pay enough attention at the time.",1204807389

130495,comment,128998,128998,0,0,eol_of_urnst,,,"MUMPS? MUMPS?? MUMPS???<p>And they specifically cite the $TEST variable????<p>The one programming language that I know of in which you can execute <i>both</i> x and y in a ""IF t THEN x ELSE y"" (not the actual MUMPS commands). That happens because the ""t"" test sets the value of $TEST (a global variable). The ""THEN"" part checks if $TEST is true, and if so executes ""x"". The ""ELSE"" part checks $TEST and if its false executes ""y"". If ""t"" is true ""x"" calls a subroutine which has a IF that sets $TEST to false then you get thrown in the deepest places of debugging hell.<p>And <i>THAT</i> is a software masterpiece?",1204806588
130494,comment,130405,130405,0,0,bkrausz,,,"And that right there is why I haven't been to any non-required classes in quite a while.<p>I really don't want to advocate my ways but it works pretty well for me: I don't go to class.  All of my classes have notes online, I just attend the review sessions before exams.  If you're interested in the topics covered you already know the basics, and if you're good at it (strong correlation to interest) you should be able to teach yourself the lessons via Wikipedia and the notes.<p>The reason I don't advocate this is because it's a pretty good way to get low B's, but makes A's very difficult.  I feel that one of two things make this ok:\n1) you're going straight into a startup out of college, where GPA doesn't matter\n2) you already had a big-name internship, and potential employers won't even care about GPA (except Google, but that's a whole other debate)<p>I've found the second to be true from personal experience.  It's a very dangerous path, but the free time payoff is huge.<p>I guess there is a huge advantage to finishing your general education requirements early...",1204806431

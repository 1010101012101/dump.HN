When people say co-founding is like a marriage, I think it's not much of a stretch to say that start-ups and hacking in general are a way of life. That's why I worded it as ""lifestyle discussions"".<p>One could say that intellectuals are similar to hackers in that both take interest in nuances of complex things, but imo, hacker culture is more individualistic (""let me do my thing"") whereas intellectualism is more of conversational (""hey, here's another thing to ponder"").",1290628791

1938368,comment,1936208,1937154,0,0,Dbug,,,"A few things to remember for those with uncertain wireless support<p>1) Don't forget you can easily try Ubuntu and wireless devices on most x86 laptops in the Live CD mode before you install.  If driving somewhere to buy a USB device, bring the laptop along.  You might also be able to run a Live CD and try a USB wireless device on another machine in the store (ask for permission first!)<p>2) If there's a Mac laptop handy, OS X doesn't need any extra software installed to share the laptops wireless access out the ethernet port, allowing simple DHCP connections.  Just go to the Sharing prefs panel.\n(add a hub or switch to share with several machines)<p>3) Instead of using a Mac, some routers with free open-source DD-WRT firmware installed can also act as WiFi clients giving access to machines plugged into the ethernet port(s).  Older WRT-54Gs often turn up cheap at thrift stores etc. and are ideal. (some versions have more RAM than others, check the DD-WRT site www.dd-wrt.com/ for more info) It's a good way to add wireless to desktops.<p>4) ... and of course Ubuntu runs well in a Virtual Box virtual machine, an easy way to use it under OS X or Windows hosts with whatever net access those already have.\nvirtualbox.org  It's a particularly simple/clean free solution for Mac users, not disturbing OS X at all.",1290628686

1938337,comment,1937879,1937879,0,0,geophile,,,"The article says: ""In the face of all this, it's fair to say that objects have failed."" The author appears to define ""this"" extremely broadly, including: ""address[ing] the computing requirements of the future"" (whatever those might be); dealing with ""software evolution"" and ""wholesale changes"" (again, not sure what that means), although that's claimed to be addressed better by open source (huh?); making programming easy; and lots of other things. Well, OK, objects also haven't cured cancer. I'm not sure what the point is, except that the author sure is pissed about Lisp being less important than it used to be.<p>Objects were certainly oversold -- what computing trend isn't? But I think they succeeded at the problem they were intended to solve. Objects are basically encapsulation and a sensible bundling of behavior and state. It's just the next step after structured programming. Before structured programming we had line labels, and goto statements, and every time you had to do branching or looping, you had to express the control structures in these primitives. Now you write if statements and while loops. It's better, it's not controversial. It didn't solve world hunger, but that doesn't mean it failed. Structured programming succeeded in the sense that it is just accepted and is no longer even noticed.<p>Objects are an improvement of that sort. Objects have state. That state can only be manipulated by a few pieces of code (methods).  This way of organizing code makes it easier to structure and debug software. It organizes coding patterns that everyone was reinventing anyway and no longer has to. It's a modest goal, and objects have succeeded in meeting it.",1290627930

This is perhaps the upside of ""nerdy"" that Matt did not mention in his article.  But I agree with him that HN is not intellectual.  When the topic of discussion is beyond the expertise of almost anyone, the only way to make progress is to apply a certain amount of intellectualism -- to be tentative, questioning, critical, contemplative, <i>nuanced</i>.  For a definition of intellect, I have always relied on Richard Hofstadter's formula, in <i>Anti-Intellectualism in American Life</i>:<p>Intellect [...] is the critical, creative, and contemplative side of mind.  Whereas intelligence seeks to grasp, manipulate, re-order, adjust, intellect examines, ponders, wonders, theorizes, criticizes, imagines.  Intelligence will seize the immediate meaning in a situation and evaluate it.  Intellect evaluates evaluations, and looks for the meanings of situations as a whole.  Intelligence can be praised as a quality in animals; intellect, being a unique manifestation of human dignity, is both praised and assailed as a quality in men.  (Chapter 2, Section 1)",1290627491

It works in roughly the same way that Daniel Bernstein, Eran Tromer, Onur Aciiçmez, and Colin Percival's (independently discovered) attacks work; you run a tight loop measuring memory accesses for cache perturbation, and postprocess the measurements to guess key bits. It has nothing to do with AES - the - algorithm.<p>The paper is interesting (they used an artificial neural network to filter the measurements), but the results aren't ultra-surprising; I think everyone expects more side channels to be discovered on x86 hardware in the coming years, especially since much of the microarchitecture is undocumented. (Note: this paper targets a very old processor, which probably improved their results).<p>The biggest issue with this branch of side channel study --- an issue not mentioned in the paper --- is that ""getting on the same machine as an encryption process"" is much less hard than it sounds in 2010: many encryption processes run on VMs inside hosting providers, where the cost of situating an attacker on the same metal as the target might be as low as $20.<p>But, long story short: this isn't the crypto attack you should be most worried about.

That is, in a conversation about how a property owner chooses to allow their property to be used, the only relevant point, legally and morally, is ""this is how I choose to allow my property to be used"". There need be no further explanation.<p>Since the whole thing is dilatory in that context, the only meaningful interpretation is as an abstract discussion of why one might want to make such a distinction. In such a discussion, the idea of tolerating the thoughts of others -- not just those who might claim offense at seeing such speech, but also those who would like to profess their beliefs -- certainly has a place.",1290625844

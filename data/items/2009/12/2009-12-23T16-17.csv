And I call it a launch, since noone knows about SO, let alone SE, except for a few thousand tech geeks. So the idea of ""oh it's just another wordpress blog"" didn't come up in the decision to cover it.<p>And hey, I had a phone interview with Venture Beat...when I launched my ""non-startup""...which is more than some ""startups"" can say.<p>Techcrunch is just a wordpress blog and it gets 7.5 million uniques. WikiHow is just a mediawiki instance and it gets 20 million uniques. You can't focus too much on a platform. You think those guys couldn't build their own product from scratch? Sure they could, but then they'd have wasted 1-2 years in development time, when they didn't have to, and that's just stupid.<p>I'm sure there are plenty of other examples of turn key solutions being used to make a business.

It doesn't matter how you get there, all that matters, is that at the end of the day you are working towards building something positive.<p>And we are getting plenty of traffic to justify that we are doing something people need.

1012327,comment,1011798,1012065,0,0,DougWebb,,,"Encapsulation generally refers to private data, but you could define classes that are just collections of methods, and you can define interfaces that are just collections of method signatures. An object which claims to support an interface can accept any of the messages defined by that interface, and another object can pass messages based on that.<p>A javascript example: in javascript, functions are objects, and can have methods.<p><pre><code>    function MyFunction(...) { ... };
    MyFunction.method1 = function(...) {...};
    MyFunction.method2 = function(...) {...};
    MyFunction.method3 = function(...) {...};
</code></pre>
Now, you can pass the messages 'method1', 'method2', or 'method3' to MyFunction. Message passing without encapsulation (as it's usually thought of.)<p>Of course, MyFunction has some default properties too, and you can define more:<p><pre><code>    MyFunction.data1 = ...;
    MyFunction.data2 = ...;
</code></pre>
That gives you traditional encapsulation, especially if you use somewhat more complex syntax to make the data private instead of public.",1261586983

Even in classes where professors or TAs effectively grade and comment the code, I think most students have a tendency to see the grade they received and ignore the professor's feedback.  The program worked, they got the grade, onto the next assignment.<p>I had two classes this past quarter taught by a professor with a very different grading system.  He used a program he wrote called the ""code critic"" to have us submit exercises into his grading queue.  Only working code could be submitted and we could only have three assignments in the queue at once.  He would then use his program to return the code with criticism added on any lines not to his liking and mark the assignment as ""Not done,"" ""Almost done,"" or ""Done.""  If he didn't mark it done, we had to fix the code in response to criticism.  These criticisms were very picky, even sometimes dealing with the naming of functions and variables.<p>At the end of the quarter we were graded on how many assignments we were completed, and <i>how much we grew as programmers</i>.  If our assignments at the end of the quarter did not require any resubmissions, this was reflected in our grade.<p>I think this method was an extremely effective alternative to traditional grading.

Just some background.<p>I used to think that Google's desire for graduate degrees was sort of elitist and not necessary.  I've changed my mind, and here's why.<p>I work in a woodshop as a way to relax and have found an analogy for the education thing.  I've come to believe that a well educated mind is sort of like a well organized shop; a self educated mind is like a messy shop.<p>There is no judgement intended, both neat and messy shops can produce excellent work, just as a self-educated person can produce just as good work as a formally educated person.<p>The difference is speed.  At the risk of stretching the analogy, in a neat shop you can find tools quickly and make things quickly.  A formally educated person uses the education to quickly make choices about how to solve problems whereas a self-educated person has to rederive a lot of those choices.<p>I've personally witnessed this in engineers that have worked for me and I'm moving towards wanting formally educated people.  If you want to do well in the tech industry, I'd strongly urge you to get a formal education and cover the basics.  If you have a CS degree and pointers bother you, you got a crappy degree.  Ditto for basic language design, compiler design, OS design.<p>Just my two cents and you should probably ignore it because while I have a masters in CS, I also have a messy shop :)",1261584936

Their business had just crossed cash flow breakeven, had grown past 50 employees, just raised a substantive follow-on round of financing and had recently hired a Chief Financial Officer. It was an impressive performance.""<p>The relevant pieces of information here are:
1. (Marginally) Cash flow positive: Even though the company may still be underwater, they are not adding to debt anymore. For a young company this is a nice place to be. Nobody expects you to be generating lots of money, but you are moving in the right direction and there is no immediate need to cut cost in order to survive.
2. Grown past 50 employees. Again, this mean they are in the right track. The fact that they are adding headcount means they are not stagnating, but growing. Besides, if they are cash flow positive, it is sustainable growth, not the crazy pump and dump trick of the dot com era.
3. Just raised a substantive follow-on round. This means they were not in immediate financial distress. They have a healthy operation and investors give them more money to keep making the right strategic decisions. No need to go cannibal here.<p>The political declaration stuff is my personal interpretation of the incident. It says nowhere that the CFO implied or suggested that they should put those techies on their place. It is my personal belief that some key people may have feel that way, and that it was a blunder to risking that mis-communication to happen in the first place.<p>Organizational culture is a delicate thing to mess with.

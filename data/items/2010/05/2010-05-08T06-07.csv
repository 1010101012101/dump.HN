If the idea has no basis in reality, then can someone demonstrate the reason for this belief with the same degree of intellectual rigor that is demanded from Christians for their beliefs? Dismissing it as mere superstition is inadequate. An evolutionary hypothesis would be quite hard to prove.",1273301766

The only truly secure strategy is an expensive one - record, upload, and replay the game on-server. The cheaper alternative is hand-moderated scoreboards. In any case, high scores are not central to the success of most games - they're a payoff that comes at the end of a session and many users will back out before finishing even one session. (Yes your game may differ, but you haven't presented data to back up the assertion.)<p>2.

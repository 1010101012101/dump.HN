Once the cold war went away there wasn&#x27;t really anyone left who offered that kind of credible threat, and attempts to turn the F14 into a bomber were more expensive and less effective than the F/A18.<p>Today, there <i>is</i> one aicraft/missile in service with roughly comparable performance to the F14/Phoenix -- the Eurofighter Typhoon II when equipped with the (similar range to Phoenix) Meteor missile. This isn&#x27;t an accident. One of the major purchasers for Typhoon is the UK, satirically renamed &quot;Airstrip One&quot; by George Orwell in <i>1984</i>; because it&#x27;s basically an unsinkable aircraft carrier off the coast of Western Europe, and in event of a conflict with Russia it&#x27;d be a major NATO logistical resupply target for the aforementioned TU-23Ms and Tu-160s. The Typhoon II was delayed into the 21st century but basically it started as a cold war solution to the exact same problem as the F14, minus the cats and traps.",1446908203

The US government spends tons of money on all sorts of things, but spending that money instead on security would mean they&#x27;d have to stop doing some of those other things that we actually pay them to do.

One of my biggest issues is not with computing so much as math. I just cannot work at the pace that a Uni course requires because I have to <i>understand</i> it.<p>For instance, it took me some time before I realised that the determinant of a matrix was really just the &quot;size&quot; of the matrix. And I couldn&#x27;t get through trigonometry till I worked out why the trig functions were called what they were called - eventually with a bit of help from Dr Math (that guy is awesome) I realised that you just create triangles in a unit circle and work out the Latin meaning for each of the lines:<p><a href=""https://sherlockchrisblog.files.wordpress.com/2015/11/trigfunctionlines4.png"" rel=""nofollow"">https://sherlockchrisblog.files.wordpress.com/2015/11/trigfu...</a><p><a href=""https://sherlockchrisblog.wordpress.com/2015/11/03/trigonometric-functions/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://sherlockchrisblog.wordpress.com/2015/11/03/trigonome...</a><p>I&#x27;m trying to put down my &quot;discoveries&quot; in a blog, but until now I didn&#x27;t realise that Wordpress allowed for LaTeX and included the ams package.<p>My blog is here:<p><a href=""https://sherlockchrisblog.wordpress.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://sherlockchrisblog.wordpress.com/</a><p>I guess I&#x27;m doing this because I was heavily involved in Wikipedia years ago, and I&#x27;d still like to contribute to society, even if I&#x27;m just rehashing material.<p>I intend to finish documenting what I know about trigonometry, then I&#x27;m going on to differential calculus and beyond.

Specifically, time not spent making finished products for sale. People working on the product still need to eat.<p>/ Anechoic chambers and other specialized equipment are expensive.<p>/ As the article details, solving for novel/unique problems can involve unique solutions. That will translate to new/ non-standard manufacturing techniques. And that means more costs.<p>/ The Wife Acceptance Factor. As pointed out in the article, getting small speaker systems to sound as big as the orchestra recorded for playback is a challenge. One approach is to use bigger drivers. Another approach is to use large arrays of drivers. Either way, you get cabinets that have the volume (size, not sound) of refrigerators. Anything that big has a noticeable visual presence. Looking good adds more to the price [If there is a question as to sources on this point, I refer to my ongoing experience as a Klipsch Cornwall owner].<p>Sidebar: As a BBC article, kinda surprised they didn&#x27;t profile Tannoy for contrast.",1446905171

Currenly there are 21 predefined lists including main sources like EasyList, regional (non-english) lists and a couple of social blocking lists.<p>The app is free and you can upgrade it for $2.99. With free version you can use only EasyList, which may very well be the only list you ever need becuase this is kind of the default one for every adblocker. With upgraded version you can use any predefined list in any combination.<p>After updating the lists you may encounter &quot;Can&#x27;t reload Safari Extension&quot; alert. Why this is happening is beyond me, sometimes Safari just can&#x27;t handle the awesomeness of content blocking concept without any apparent reason. Looks like it depends on the device, so if you see this alert - just tap &quot;Try Again&quot; a couple of times, usually 3-5 is enough. In the next versions i&#x27;ll try to make it less anoying. Also, all this &quot;Content Blocking&quot; thing if full of limitations, so you can&#x27;t use more than some-unknown-amount of filters (probably also depends on the device). On my iPhone 6 i&#x27;ve been able to enable EasyList, EasyPrivacy, RU Adlist and Fanboy&#x27;s Annoyance list just fine. More than that just resulted in &quot;Can&#x27;t reload ...&quot; alert. But you don&#x27;t really need too many filters, usual rule of &quot;too much filters may slow down your browsing expirience&quot; may apply here too, hence the limitation.

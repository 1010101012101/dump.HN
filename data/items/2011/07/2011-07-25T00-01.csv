The notion that perception is reality and a loss of confidence is the worst thing that can ever happen conspire to stifle public questioning.<p>We see it with Afghanistan, stimulus spending, TARP.  As justifications don't pan out, something else is used to justify things.<p>Of course, the real root cause is that those paying for things are far removed from the decision making process.  If voters individually decided whether they were going to be taxed $500 a year for continuing the shuttle or $100 a year for returning to disposable rockets, this program would have been killed long ago.<p>But everything is put in one big pot and dollars borrowed to conceal the actual ultimate pain.

2800853,comment,2800538,2800720,10,0,econgeeker,,,"I've interviewed many engineers in my career (I've been writing software for over 20 years.)  I've evolved my process for finding good engineers.<p>The problem with most technical interviews is that they end up asking trick questions, where the answer is more important than the process (and thus the ""process of problem solving"" is not even relevant.)  You'll notice, this guy actually solved the problem in question, immediately, but that wasn't acceptable because it wasn't a technical solution.<p>Critical thinking is very important, I agree.  Far more important than problem solving, and one of the real problems is, that people think that these kinds of interviews actually reveal ones ability to think critically. They are not the same.  Problem solving is more of a process one can learn, critical thinking is more of a talent, or maybe a willingness, to step outside the problem and evaluate, for instance, whether it should even be solved.<p>In my experience- but I could be wrong- I would say there is a very strong correlation between being able to solve mathematical brain teasers and having <i>trouble</i> with critical thinking.  (Unfortunately, these people do not realize that they have trouble engaging in critical thinking.)  I can't find a correlation between solving the type of problems on google billboards and being good at critical thinking. Its mostly about awareness of obscure (to the mainstream, anyway) math.<p>Being able to solve problems is good for an engineer. All good engineers can do this.<p>Critical thinking, however, makes the great engineers great, and it eliminates the need to solve large numbers of tough problems.  Engineers can end up in the weeds because they chase tough problems to solve (they're fun!) rather than employing critical thinking to keep focused on the important business problems.<p>The examples from this blog are not very illustrative of my point, but there it is.",1311555402
2800852,comment,2798813,2799002,2,0,justin_vanw,,,"Well, the 'pet feature' that MySQL lacks is 'ability to efficiently join between tables'.  I think that is pretty high up on the list of important features for a relational database.<p>Saying this is a 'no true scottsman' is a 'straw man' on your part.  Lots of people only have experience with MySQL, and think that it is somehow representative of the quirks and performance characteristics of all relational databases, which is simply not true.  MySQL is popular, and that is the entirety of the list of positive things I can say about it.  It's buggy (known segfault bugs accepted in final release versions), slow (I've seen identical fairly simple queries run on identical schemas with identical indexing and identical data run side by side on Postgresql and MySQL when we were moving away from MySQL.  In Postgresql the query in question ran in about 4 seconds, on MySQL the query never finished, even after allowing hours to pass), bizarre (many table engines parse and silently ignore all FK constraints), non-transactional (unless you use one of the transactional table engines, and then it is slow), poor with concurrency (several table engines have table level locks, the ones that are MVCC have silly concurrency limitations, until recently Innodb could only do 4 core concurrency, due to some weird implementation), and will fuck you in sneaky ways (a VARCHAR(N) can hold N bytes, so if you store unicode data you can't necessarily store N characters.  That's not the only absurd and horrifying wart, there are literally dozens).",1311555373

2800836,comment,2800538,2800677,28,0,econgeeker,,,"""They go around the internet looking for candidates who look like they are pretty smart (insightful blog posts, open source contributions, etc), however they don't always have the deep technical ability to differentiate people who would and would not be a good fit for Google.""<p>I once created a LinkedIn account to see someone's profile.  It was meant to be a throwaway but I didn't delete it.  The account had no activity, no ""insightful blog posts"", no open source contributions, nothing but a single job listing under a previous position.<p>Not being a real person, nobody contacted this account... except google recruiters.  And they did it persistently.  It was right out of glengarry glenross.  They were very smug, which I thought was amusing because, well, they were chasing a non-existent entity. (even if I didn't have my own startup, I have no interest in ever working for google.)<p>When I didn't answer the first recruiter, after many emails, I was handed off to another guy who felt this event was significant enough to send me, yet another email about it.  In it one of the things he said was: ""I identify top-tier engineers for Google""<p>Of course, when looking at his profile, his background is in recruiting, not engineering, and his degree is in accounting, not engineering. (No disrespect to accountants.)<p>I'm completely burned out on recruiter hyperbole, and absolutely have spent the last conversation I'll ever have with a non-technical recruiter whose trying to ""evaluate"" me.   Here's how the last one went (before I started refusing to deal with recruiters, which, by the way, produced better job leads and better jobs.)<p>Her: Do you have oracle experience? (having not told me anything about the job, other than it was a ""coder"" job.)
Me: Well, I was writing java that generated SQL dynamically to talk to an oracle database.  The SQL had to be dynamic because...
Her: (interrupting) which oracle?
Me: Uh, the one from Oracle corporation. 
Her: What was the version number
Me: (just because I'd happened to see it in passing) 8i I believe.
Her: OH, sorry, the client wants 9i experience.  (9i, I later discovered had been released within the previous 3 months.)   I'll keep you in mind and let you know if I find anything that matches your level of qualifications. (From tone of voice, it was obvious I wasn't ""up to speed"" in her eyes.)<p>Later I was awarded a patent as sole inventor for the technology I'd tried to describe in her question.<p>Anyway, getting tired of constant emails from google recruiters, and irritated at this non-engineers belief that he ""identifies"" ""top flight"" engineers, I asked him what he looks for in a phone interview.<p>Here's a direct quote of his answer.  Because this is obvious nonsense (he can't evaluate any of these things from the perspective of an accountant) he's clearly just playing buzzword bingo, and in the hopes of getting other engineers past this fake ""evaluation"" to talk to real engineers, this is all you have to say:<p>""The l things I look for when I'm having a phone conversation with an engineer (at a high level):
- What big problems are they solving (large scalability and storage issues, advanced algorithms, etc...) 
- Involvement in complete product development (are they shipping products or are mainly doing integration)
- Technical coding, % of time they spend coding, languages they're coding in.
- use of data structures and algorithm writing. 
- Educational background and motivation for making a change.""<p>Note that ""I got tired of being harassed by google recruiters"" is probably not a good answer for the last one.<p>From the original article: 
""I guess thats why when I interviewed for my transfer, I was told I was not technical enough to do the job Id been doing for 3 years already, supporting the Freebase community.""<p>Google literally told this guy he was not capable of doing the job he was already doing, and given that it was a startup, a job he had likely created himself.<p>""There are plenty of fresh-faced kids from Stanford and MIT and whatever other elite universities are on Googles preferred list, who can solve stupid puzzles and tell you the O notation of anything you want.""<p>Well, when your founders were graduate students at Stanford, and they implemented a hiring policy right out of school, it shouldn't be surprising that they have an arbitrary filter like that, and a focus on identifying personalities that are nearly identical to the founders.<p>Finding people like yourself is orthogonal to finding good employees who will find the best position.  In the worst case it can result in a monoculture where literally every employee is blind to a solution that would be obvious to at least somebody if you had more diversity.<p>I've not worked with google, so obviously I'm just giving my impressions based on my experiences being recruited by them (and this has happened ore than once, the LinkedIn example was just the most recent.)",1311555032

Writing for an audience also makes you evaluate what ideas may be relevant and what irrelevant.<p>Its even better if you have somebody you can use as a soundboard to talk about your ideas.  Of course, thats not always possible (and is very obnoxious!), so the email method works better for me.",1311552751
2800743,comment,2800412,2800668,5,0,wallflower,,,"> But besides that one interest, how do you go farther?<p>It really comes down to taking the initiative. The goal when you first meet someone you like (aside from the rare person you meet on a plane and connect with and share life stories) could be (sometimes you might not meet them again) to meet them again. Don't try to ""date"" them (friends or potential lovers) on the first meeting - the whole goal is to get the contact information to meet again, somewhere else, ideally doing something the other person likes. Just find out what the other person likes to do and invite them to go do it - 'I love art - and watching people enjoy art - I'd like to meet up and go with you to the X exhibit and the museum' - (the key word here is 'I'd like' phrasing - not 'Do you want to?' - express your preference, take the lead...)<p>I've met a fair number of the people who matter in my life through taking the initiative and talking to strangers. But, to be clear, it was not a first degree contact - it was meeting them through the person I initially met.<p>The problem with Google+ Circles, is that it does not allow overlap. In real life, the interesting connections occur when you overlap circles (e.g. throw a party and your improv friends meet your Salsa dancing friends). Throwing a party is one of the most effective ways to improve your social life. Indeed, taking the lead on anything is powerful. Going to an event solo may make you feel like a pariah but going with two other people - you're golden.<p>The ideal is the self-perpetuating party - e.g. you throw enough regular parties that you get invited to outings constantly. Doesn't have to be a Saturday night blow-out, something like a Tuesday night potluck for three or four friends, once or twice a month, will really grow your social circles.<p>And, most importantly, to end my soapbox (thanks for asking), just be yourself. If you are quiet and shy, don't try to be Tom Cruise 'Show me the money'. Be yourself. As much as I wanted to be the life of the party, I'm relatively happy knowing a lot of people from various worlds and circles. When I hang out with people, its usually not very regularly and usually with their good friends (and I'm the odd one out).<p>But the universe rewards bold action.",1311552723

Can you really build a website in 15 minutes? The purpose of the projects mentioned is not of importance and I am not trying to criticise the work accomplished. What I am curious about is did it really take 15 minutes or even a weekend to create these projects?<p>It takes months or years to learn programming language, databases, networking... Frameworks, apis, and modern programming language makes it easy to develop but you still need to learn about them. It may have taken just the weekend to build the project but it doesn't include all the initial learning. That is my problem. It makes it sound so easy to develop an app or a website when actually it requires a lot of effort.<p>Also ideas need to mature and it may take several days or weeks before implementing the idea. Chatting with friends, searching for similar implementations, finding and registering the domain name takes time.<p>I have been working for months now on my project and as I record the hours spent, I know it is more than 500 hours and the website is far from complete.<p>Can we be honest with the time we spent on our weekend project and simply call it ""My project""?",1311552338

The basic POS thing is never going to work. It's not obviously better but involves set up by both the buyer and seller. And it's kinds of weird (""Sign with your face""??). But then there's a loyalty scheme layered on top. But without any traction on either side, that's not going to work. With money transfers, you should at least copy PayPal to address the chicken and egg problem: let people transfer to an email address or phone number so that the service only requires the sender to be signed up and enabled. Splitting checks is either a small or just bad idea. That's just not a big problem for most people and not one that most would pay to ""solve"".<p>Finally, we get it, the government sucks when it comes to making laws like those that make starting up a money transmitter company harder. But other entrepreneurs seem to have addressed it. There are a variety of ways to approach it. For one, use a partner for the transmission part and focus on what you think your added-value is. It would be quite easy to layer a face/barcode scheme on top of PayPal, for example. If you can prove it out, then you're in a better position to handle the money transmission yourself.

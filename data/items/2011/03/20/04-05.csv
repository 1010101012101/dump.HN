I can see if their work history for public consumption is similar to the one which is on their resume (tailored for the position). I can also see if anyone I know has worked with them before and then get an off the record assessment of their previous work and a feel for them as a person. Neither of those directly contributes to a hire/no-hire decision but it does help with getting to know what the candidate is like.\nAs a side note, I tried posting a job recently and was hugely underwhelmed with both the quality and quantity of applicants.",1300597051

It's terrible at helping me make new connections.<p>I should know, that's partly why we founded <a href=""http://letslunch.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://letslunch.com</a>. We felt that the LinkedIn introduction ""the InMail"" just didn't work. So we implemented a sort of reverse-Facebook concept: meet people who are not your friends yet. So far, it has been really successful at growing people's connections, where LinkedIn, in my opinion, failed miserably.

2345574,comment,2343570,2344313,0,0,cookiecaper,,,"The interesting thing about this comment is that OGL allows such vendor specific extensions without totally destroying everything else. No need to sit around for 2-3 years and wait on MS, people can start programming for that hardware relatively easily. My understanding (not too involved in 3D) is that vendors usually mimic any unique extensions that their competitors might have, but even so it's easy to test caps and turn off a feature if hardware doesn't support it (in fact, all games do this, even DX games; you still have to test caps and profile hw to know what code paths to run and what features to enable). A well-architected engine is flexible and allows you to write sfx even if only one card on the market supports that feature without much hassle, and this is a lot easier to do in OGL with its extensions model than DX, afaik.<p>Again, not too heavy on the 3D, please correct anything I got wrong.<p>I agree about open drivers, though. There is such a wide field of possibilities with open drivers if vendors would only take them seriously and quit being so paranoid about ""their IP"" and all that. I think great OSS drivers is one of the most important goals for desktop Linux atm.",1300596822

How big of a budget increase for NPR would it take to stop Gaddafi from crushing the rebellion and massacring the rebels and many many uninvolved civilians?<p>I suppose if Gaddafi were a contestant on ""Wait Wait...Don't Tell Me"" and won Carl's voice on his home answering machine, he might feel so happy he just could not bring himself to order the next round of killings. Or maybe if ""This American Life"" were on more, he'd get caught up in some of those great stories and forget about the revolt? Maybe Gaddafi is crazy because there's a weird noise in his car, and if only ""Car Talk"" were on 7 days a week instead of 1, a solution to his problem might be revealed, and then he'd stop being crazy?<p>In other words, what the heck does NPR's budget have to do with the situation in Libya?",1300596312

A niche community or site has things simple -- they need to get direct advertising from businesses in their field. A more generic web service (like Facebook) could use only the data a user explicitly provides on their profile. A site with wide ranges of content could use contextual advertising. All of these options only use data that's already available on a company's servers, and do not require tapping into browser histories through tracking cookies. The main problem with tracking is its implicit nature -- most people don't realize just how much their browsing history reveals about them, but they do understand the information they explicitly reveal on Facebook or Twitter.",1300596132

Click the 'Add Permission' button to bring up Facebook's Permissions page"".  We have a button that looks SUPER clickable, like if you didn't click it you'd feel horrible because it has nice css gradients and looks like it's 3D.  Underneath we have a message that says: ""We won't publish anything without your direct permission to any part of Facebook, promise"".  Once you click the button, it will show you the FB permission prompt.  yes, it's multiple steps, but it's clean and makes people feel really confident.

I'd recommend asking for just the minimum of what you need and then if they need to access a feature that requires more ask for it then.  Do a progressive rights request or have some video explaining the service.<p>Right now with the simple design and just text most people won't offer you their Facebook rights.",1300594818

I thought (1) and (2) were true, but in a sort of vacuous sense... that is, you can ask <i>yourself</i> those questions, but - for most people - the answer will simply always be ""yes"" because people tend to fall in love with their own ideas.  It's hard to be objective when asking yourself questions about yourself.  Maybe some rare people can truly pull it off, but I like the emphasis on (a), external feedback, and (b) ""does it scratch an itch?""<p>Short of doing some formal market research, or something like @sgblank's ""Customer Development"" stuff, I think those points are the best place to start.",1300594815

If not, you're asking for a huge failure on a critical part.""<p>That's at least party due to the different design requirements and constraints that mass-produced for-profit engineers work under. That lawnmower wheel screw was specified not purely on the engineering requirements to ""hold the wheel on"", but on various other important-to-the-company-designing-them-for-sale requirements, probably including things like: use the cheapest fastener that we already keep in stock that'll do the job, use a fastener that will reliably last the length of the warranty period at the lowest cost, use a fastener that's compatible with out existing automated manufacturing tools. On top of that there will have been other decisions already made like ""use an existing wheel assembly"" and ""ensure the mowers packaged size and weight fit in with existing supply chain logistics"".<p>Once designers are freed from existing manufacturing industry constraints, I like to hope that one day we'll download a push-mower design from somewhere like Google Sketchup, where the designers were perfectly happy to ""over engineer"" critical components and where the design requirements might include ideas like ""should last long enough to pass on to your grandchildren"", and ""will still be able to be repaired at the side of the road with a flatblade screwdriver and a rock"".",1300593969

Your systems can last longer if they&#x27;re based on free software, so you don&#x27;t have to worry about a dependency going away and you not being able to fix it.  (And of course effective copy protection here is the kiss of death.)<p>2. Your systems can last longer if they have <i>less</i> dependencies.  (I tried to compile a six-months-old Guix from six months ago from source for several days.  This was difficult because it depends on so many things.)<p>3. Your systems can last longer if the dependencies they have are <i>more popular</i>.  Installing DOSBOX today is a lot easier than installing an emulator that will emulate the Tandy 1000 version of MS-DOS.  (I think Lotus 1-2-3 had a Tandy version, right?)  This is synergistic with the previous two: your free-software dependencies are still going to be a pain to handle if nobody else uses them.<p>4.

It was the logo the company had used for the longest time, the logo that adorned their best (and their worst) products. It was a logo that everyone had seen, everyone knew, that was incredibly recognisable.<p>And then they threw that all away, and created intentional brand confusion by swapping their logo for the <i>Windows</i> logo, then completely replacing Windows&#x27; logo with a grayscale tilted pane of glass.<p>Why? Why fix what&#x27;s not broken? Why replace the well-known with the unrecognisable?<p>Google&#x27;s logo, the one they used from 1999-2010, was also iconic. It was easily readable: it had a typeface made for legibility and style, not made to be mathematically simple. It contrasted well with any background. It was the logo that everyone knew.<p>And while this particular change isn&#x27;t quite so drastic as Microsoft&#x27;s was, it&#x27;s still strange to me. Why is it necessary?

Just put it in your hosts file and &quot;block&quot; it by pointing it at 127.0.0.1. If you really need access, &quot;unblock&quot; it by undoing that. This sounds stupid, but it really helps. Everytime you waste time at a site, add it. That works for most sites- not all, but enough.<p>Another technique mentioned was breaking tasks up into hour blocks with rewards. This sounds like Pomodoro technique. I tried that on multiple occasions and it never worked. The timer and breaks distract me and interrupt whatever flow I might have been lucky enough to get into. I&#x27;ve never worked with anyone that has continued to use this technique. Rewards in-general work, but I&#x27;d just have a reward when done with a task and have smaller tasks.<p>Here are other techniques that really work: (1) Find work you like to do and that you are good at, and find an environment where you excel. If you can&#x27;t, then try to reduce stress through music, taking brief walks, etc. (2) Sleep more. (3) Lose weight in a healthy sustainable way. (4) Get exercise regularly.

Earlier this year there was Cricket World Cup and most of the world cup schedules I checked were in the form of a long table, nothing interactive. It was a pain to find matches happening on particular day/team/venue in one glance.<p>So me and another friend set out to create a schedule viewer that will give us match info within 1~2 secs and wrote a simple but interactive schedule viewer[1] with AngularJS over a weekend. We posted it to r/cricket subreddit but didn&#x27;t get more than couple hundred views. I also tried tweeting other former cricketers,cricket writers but my tweet got buried in no time because these people had fans ranging from 100k to 2mil.<p>Then I noticed espencricinfo.com website had a twitter section that listed tweets from all these prominent cricket figures in real-time as they were tweeted.<p>So during the match when everybody was watching and tweeting, I started tweeting these folks link to our interactive dashboard. This increased chance of them seeing my tweet and we got RTs from a lot of them this way. Of course for that our dashboard had to be the best out there and it was (it worked on mobile browser too).<p>With just few tweet to celebrity cricketers/sports writers we went from hundreds to over 30k page view and 7k recurring viewers over the course of world cup. The key I think was to get noticed when they were most active and also have a nice app/content to convince them to RT.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.itinora.com/worldcup2015"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.itinora.com/worldcup2015</a>",1441157854

There&#x27;s good reason to believe I&#x27;m right: it will fail with SIGILL on any Intel system and on all native 32-bit systems whatsoever, and it&#x27;ll blow it in strange ways even on AMD systems unless the SYSCALL instruction is followed by an explicit reload of the SS register, because reasons [1].<p>If you&#x27;re interested, v1 is here:<p><a href=""http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.linux.kernel/2030456"" rel=""nofollow"">http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.linux.kernel/2030456</a><p>[1] It&#x27;s reasonably widely known that Intel screwed up SYSRET in a way that caused basically every OS ever to have an exploitable root hole.

Very new Linux kernels work around this in the kernel, but most Linux kernels actually had an SS reload in the vDSO.<p>[2] AMD&#x27;s design for the SYSCALL instruction as implemented for 32-bit code running under a 64-bit kernel is bad in a way that makes using it quite nasty.

A 3 disk RAID1 has the size of 1 disk and a 3 disk RAID5 has the size of 2 disks so they&#x27;re not the same. To make it comparable you need to make the array RAID6 at which point you have the same space and redundancy. You&#x27;d still do a RAID1 though as for the 1 disk size case there is no added benefit of parity.<p>Pardon, but <i>what</i>?<p>Think about this for a second.<p>For one, now you&#x27;re moving the goalpost by shifting gears to disk capacity alone (which, as I&#x27;ve mentioned repeatedly, is a non-factor if you&#x27;re considering anything mirror-based).  <i>With the same number of disks</i>, mirroring always beats parity in a RAID.  There&#x27;s no getting around that.<p>Don&#x27;t believe me?  Take those four disks (you need four at minimum) in your RAID6.  Your array can survive two disk failures.  Now I build a RAID1 with four disks.  Mine can survive three disk failures.  Yes, there&#x27;s a capacity hit, but it&#x27;s been <i>repeatedly</i> established that it&#x27;s not <i>capacity</i> that matters.<p>This still holds true when comparing a three-disk RAID5 and a three-disk RAID1.  This still holds true when comparing <i>any</i> n-disk n-1-parity-block array with <i>any</i> n-disk RAID1 with the same value of n.<p>Your points are much more valid when they&#x27;re targeted at RAID10 instead of the concept of mirroring in general.",1441156076

10156871,comment,10156265,10156265,0,0,amluto,,,"> In my case, I was designing a spec for a CPU that was intended to be as minimal as possible. The CPU would physically implement signed or unsigned atomic math operations, not both. The compiler would support the missing one (signed or unsigned) using emulation in terms of the one that was physically implemented.<p>I find that part very strange.  Here are a couple of observations:<p>* Unsigned wrapping binary addition and two&#x27;s complement addition are identical as long as you don&#x27;t try to report carry or overflow.<p>* Unsigned wrapping binary subtraction and two&#x27;s complement subtraction are identical as long as you don&#x27;t try to report borrow or underflow.  If the goal is absolute simplicity, subtraction isn&#x27;t needed at all because both cases are efficiently handled by two&#x27;s complement negation  (which is the same thing as calculating 0-x in an unsigned wrapping sense) followed by addition.<p>* Unsigned wrapping binary non-widening multiplication (the usual case) and two&#x27;s complement multiplication are identical.  This follows from the distributive law: an n-bit two&#x27;s complement negative number -x is represented as 2^n - x.  If you multiply -x (a two&#x27;s complement number interpreted as unsigned) by y, you end up with (2^n - x) * y, which is y<i>2^n - x</i>y.  The first term doesn&#x27;t affect the result, because its low bits are all zero.<p>Widening multiplication is extremely useful, but implementing the unsigned version in hardware should make it fairly simple to emulate the signed version.  x86 implements both.<p>Division is nasty, especially because number theorists and C programmers disagree on what it means when negative numbers are involved.  Really simple CPUs don&#x27;t implement division at all, though.<p>Finally, CPU vendors who actually implement undefined behavior are, in my opinion, nuts.  Give the CPU a nice clean spec that fully defines what happens and stick to it.",1441155903
10156870,comment,10156265,10156265,0,0,w8rbt,,,"One quick side story. Years ago, when I worked in automobile systems programming, some coworkers had to bring up a CAN bus data extraction system quickly (less than a week) that worked with all of our programming tools. We used Java, C#, C, Python and C++ to capture, process and display the data to end users.<p>To save time (due to the short schedule), they decided to store all numbers as 64 bit doubles. They reasoned that 64 bit doubles were big enough to hold any number that might come off the system controllers (some where intel, others motorola) and would simplify the design so that they could write it quickly.<p>Some time later, we discovered an infrequent bug where occasionally, some of the CAN variables were correct, but at other times they failed sanity checks (way outside of the expected values for the specific sensor).<p>Long story short, the issue turned-out to be that 64 bit double assumption. Sometimes there was enough space to store a large 64 bit int (if the int was 52 bits or less (IIRC)), at other times the int was too large to fit. The sign (+/-) and exponent take up 12 bits or so.<p>The moral of the story is to use the right size (and sign) for each variable and don&#x27;t assume that one size will fit all. We had to go back and correct all the bad values. That took awhile. In hindsight, they should have been given more time to design the system.",1441155879

Doesn&#x27;t something like Dropbox handle this?  (Speaking as a non-photographer and non-Dropbox user... maybe I just won&#x27;t &quot;get it&quot; on that aspect.)  If not, why can&#x27;t they just make a better app solution?  And why does it have to use the cloud, as opposed to your system at home, or a local SD card?  If your &quot;infinite storage&quot; is only 100GB (and that&#x27;s a perk for Kickstarter backers only!), you can get that for less than $80 on an SD card!*  If you&#x27;re going to spend hundreds on a new phone to put your photos in the cloud, let&#x27;s hope the camera you&#x27;re stuck with is decent (they claim it is.)<p>Judging by their $500k+ worth of funding in their first day on Kickstarter(!), they&#x27;ve managed to sell people on this, but I&#x27;m not sure it&#x27;s really about the cloud syncing (there are &quot;enthusiasts&quot; who would buy just for fun, maybe people like the design, and the company is supposedly committed to updating the OS over time.)  I think there&#x27;s something about Kickstarter that gets people to buy something they wouldn&#x27;t be jumping to buy if they just saw it in the phone store.  But hey, if it makes money, who cares, I guess...<p>* Possible caveat: I often see Android phones spec&#x27;d as 64GB max SD card size.  I&#x27;m not sure if that&#x27;s just the most they were tested with, it&#x27;s a FAT filesystem limit, etc.  But if that&#x27;s an actual barrier, I&#x27;d still rather see kernel patches or hardware hacks like &quot;paging&quot; between two 64GB virtual cards before this.",1441155773

I was part of Vivisimo (spin off from CMU) which created a ""clustering engine"". In the beginning we always had the ""Librarians"", pro categorization & classification, dismissing the interest of Clustering (or maybe they were justifying their job). Then more people in the organizations (government or corp.) said yes those 2 approaches (automatic ""on the fly"" clustering vs human generated taxonomies) are complimentary. Finally couple years ago, in the same week, I visited the Government of Israel which said ""we just need clustering"" eg. on the left side: <a href=""http://search1.gov.il/govilt?query=israel"" rel=""nofollow"">http://search1.gov.il/govilt?query=israel</a>  and then Ferrari competition in Maranello (yeah:) even if I don't like cars;) and there their CTO explained to my surprise [was trying to tell him ""we integrate well with your existing taxonomies, ontologies...""] ""forget about any hierarchy or classification tree in our File Systems, we just search!"". Reality/information is much more diverse & evolving than any predefined categories.",1289728698

This was more pervasive in Japan, where most scientists from unit 731 were given pardon, and held highly respectable positions well after the second WW (e.g. M.

There's no other way.<p>I've seen this working live only in the Be Filesystem, or BFS. There you can be sure that if you add an image somewhere, another view of the filesystem will instantly contain the new file and removing it will again banish the image from all other views.

1902932,comment,1902595,1902595,0,0,bensummers,,,"I've spent the last 3.5 years building a platform for ""information applications"". The key observation which prompted this was that hierarchical file systems didn't work well for organising information within an organisation.<p>However, hierarchy itself is still incredibly valuable. People think in terms of hierarchies - it's just that they think in terms of multiple hierarchies and an item will almost always belong in more than one place in those hierarchies.<p>If you allow users to describe items in the way which makes sense to them, and then search and browse by any of the terms they've used, then you've eliminated almost all the frustrations of a file system. In my experience of working with people building complex information applications, you need:<p><pre><code>  * deep hierarchy for classifying things
  * shallow hierarchy for noting relationships (eg ""parent company"")
  * multi-values for every single field
  * controlled values (in our case by linking to other items wherever possible)
</code></pre>
Unfortunately, none of this stuff is done well by existing database systems. Which was annoying, because I had to write an object store.",1289727648

At first I thought I read it wrong... wow, its sounds like you are gay/lesbian and you say that!<p>If you believe (or anyone believes) that women are under-represented in the field, then why would you support the position of only hiring women?  It doesn't solve the problem.<p>If you believe that women are underrepresented, then address the issue, NOT THE OUTCOME.  Use that money to fund CS scholarships for women or programs that encourage programming for female high school students.  Personally, I think that all teenagers should have learn a language(computer!) in high school; I wish I had learned programming sooner but there really isn't mainstream way to learn it outside of college and even then you don't get much exposure to it unless you know its there.<p>This would be no different than Harvard saying they are hiring a feminist studies teacher (A field that most agree is female dominated) but one of the bone fide occupational qualifications is being male.  There are probably hundreds of qualified women who want an equal chance at that position.  Instead they don't get a chance at all, why -because they were born with a vagina?!?!?!<p>The practice of hiring like that is discriminatory.

This would give you the flexibility to change your schema without breaking file paths while still being able to organize and name things sanely.<p>As far as metaphors, I'd say think of calling someone on a landline vs. a cell phone.  With the cell, you don't have to specify where or who joe is (/people/friends/joe/house|work|carphone|vacation|etc.) in order to reach him since joe's 1 cellphone number rings wherever he happens to be.<p>Another example is folders on the iphone -- moving an app into a folder with other apps doesn't actually move the app from /homescreen/app1 to /homescreen/games/app1 on the iphone hard disk (as far as I know...), it just changes the superficial hierarchical view of the data.",1289727409

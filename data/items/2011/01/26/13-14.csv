Plunking down a few bucks for some games once every decade doesn't count. I like Linux as much as the next guy and I've used it since 1998, but the extremists (at the FSF and elsewhere) that have managed to somehow convince a large enough portion of Linux users that paying for software is somehow a moral issue (I mean, seriously?) have killed 90% of the market in that area. Yes I know that a few companies left and right make a few cents on 'support' and other such frolicking in the margin, but Red Hat is the only one who has managed to make any serious money from Linux itself (as opposed to some others who have found a sound and cheap platform on it to build their product offerings on, those seem to do OK with it)..",1296050206

There's a C++ ""plugin development kit"" that's been out for a couple months now and AFAIK that doesn't change when Enyo gets introduced. I didn't really look, not particularly interested in WebOS C++ development.<p>Enyo is a palm-developed js framework originally created by the Ares editor team that performs (reportedly) dramatically better on the same hardware than Mojo. I believe the difference is that Enyo uses a javascript layout system a la Sproutcore/Cappuccino instead of the html+css layout in Mojo so they're basically innerHTMLing everything instead of performing a bunch of DOM manipulations/reflows. I'd expect a number of other changes but aside from that and allowing multiple-layouts (i.e. for tablets) that's all I came away with from the developer day talk on it.<p>I started looking into WebOS when CES was going because I was wondering at Palm's absence. It turns out that the homebrew community is surprisingly vibrant and they have (basically) an independent market app (preware) for their apps and patches. I was most impressed by the patching. The entire interface is interpreted, so changing how things work is just a matter of modifying the appropriate javascript and rebooting the device.<p>All in all, I was impressed enough to get a developer account and start intermittently hacking apps. Enyo isn't out but it'll have to come out soon in order to handle tablet layouts so I'm heistant to commit to a Mojo app before the big Feb 9 event.

I say this as a Python programmer who has only recently begun to seriously learn Perl as my day job demands it. Earlier, I had used Perl only off and on for small scripts. I was always put off by Perl syntax and contexts. However, once I got over that and started using it seriously, it does have a lot of neat features.<p>One example, I recently got to know about attributes[1] (which probably people using Perl for some time may know already) and its neat uses. I can use attributes to do what I would do with a Python decorator[2]. IIUC, this feature has been in Perl since 5.6 (2003). Yes, I still like Python and I continue to believe that its easier to write bad code in Perl than in Python but I have a lot more respect, liking and understanding of Perl than I did a month ago. IMO Perl 5 is well positioned for meeting enterprise needs as it stands today. I understand this now after I spend the last 3 months debating and discussing with the architecture board of my employer to introduce Python as an officially approved language for our IT applications (I work for a large corporation so we have a lot of policies ;)).<p>As a language, I like Perl 6 even more based on what I have read[3]. I hope to spend some time playing with Rakudo sometime soon and eagerly await a production ready package.<p>[1] <a href=""http://perldoc.perl.org/attributes.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://perldoc.perl.org/attributes.html</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.perl.com/pub/2007/04/12/lightning-four.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.perl.com/pub/2007/04/12/lightning-four.html</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://perlcabal.org/syn/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://perlcabal.org/syn/</a>",1296048787

2143175,comment,2137950,2140486,0,0,nika,,,"Robbery is a fine term.  However, taxes are not commerce because they do not involve consent. You reference the state deciding to provide services ""at [prices] they deem reasonable"".  Would you go to a restaurant and let them decide what to feed you (if anything) and let them dictate the prices and consider that commerce?  Maybe such a restaurant might be a sensation in New York, until the novelty wore off, but still the people who go to it are choosing to go to it, presumably knowing the risks. How can that be commerce where you don't get to choose to participate, don't get any say in prices, and may not feel you're getting any value out of the deal?  That's not an exchange.<p>There is a fifth option and it is perfectly moral: simply don't pay taxes.  This is not stealing because you are not obligated to the terms of an agreement that you have not consented to.  If I'm obligated to pay taxes, then you are obligated to pay me $100,000 for responding.  Why? Because I said so.  Think that is a pretty lame justification? You're right, and so it is with the state when they claim moral justification for demanding payment.   The paltry ""services"" they provide generally don't benefit citizens (the police, for instance, spend their time defending the interests of the state, not the citizens)... they exist mostly as rationalizations for taking more money.  EG: a state will levy a %1 tax to provide roads, a few years later, shift that money elsewhere, wait for the roads to go to hell and then say ""we need to raise taxes in order to pay for the roads"".  They simply ignore that they already passed a tax for that purpose.<p>Here's a hypothetical: I am born into a house on a block with four other houses.  My parents were forced by a bully to pay ""property taxes"" because he said ""youse gotta mighty fine house here. Sure would be a shame if something were to happen to it, say, a fire, or even just ""hooligans"" breaking you windows...""  When they died they left the house to me.  Meanwhile the Bully put up a streetlamp that shines right into my bedroom window so he and his friends can play soccor in the street at night... the light and noise keeps me up at night.<p>Am I morally obligated to pay the bully protection money because he threatens my person or property with damage if I don't?  I never signed a contract with the bully.  Am I morally obligated to pay him because he ""provides"" a street lamp I do not want?   The bully calls a vote of the other 3 houses on the block.  They happen to be inhabited by the bullies friends.  They all vote to raise the taxes on my house (but not theirs, of course.)  Am I morally obligated to pay these increased taxes because there was an election (that I didn't participate in, but if I had, that wouldn't have meant anything, the election was rigged, as are all elections in the USA which prevent anyone but representatives of our one party government from running.)<p>I submit further, that because my parents paid taxes (or I might have in the past) that I have the right to whatever benefit of that street lamp because it is a paltry compensation when compared to the taxes I (or they) were forced to pay.  But even if it isn't, I didn't agree to the streetlamp and thus am not morally obligated to pay for it.<p>When you see it on this level, only a few people, the morality, or rather, immorality of it is stark.  It doesn't change by adding years of tradition and a lot more people being involved.<p>To the bully's friends, I'm ""a fucking idiot"" because they profit from me paying taxes. They expect to benefit out of proportion to their costs. (The reality is generally the opposite of course, but they aren't educated in economics, and their impression of the economics industry is filled with nonsense put forth by so called ""experts"" hired by the bully.)   They know it is wrong to extort money from me, so they can't make an articulate argument, but they can call me names and vote me down, while voting the bully up.<p>You may genuinely believe that these ""services"" are valuable.  In some cases I concede they have some value, but never close to their cost, and my personal perspective is that they have a negative net value on my life.  Further, by providing them the government generally criminalizes any competition. It is illegal for anyone else to offer first class mail service.  Do you think we're getting a great deal on our mail delivery in this monopoly situation?<p>But even if you are right and they are valuable, the lack of consent undermines any possible morality of taxation.  I did not consent to taxation, I do not consent to these services, and I did not even consent to the existence of this government.  I have no problem dealing with corporations who deal with me on a consensual basis.  Sometimes I've felt ripped off, but I've taken my business elsewhere.<p>But I am continually amazed that people can see non-consentual relationships, backed up with the threat of violence as somehow ""moral"".  I suspect that this is the purpose of government schools- they indoctrinate kids to believe government is somehow different and that the rules of morality don't apply to the actions of government.  Certainly there wasn't a lot of critical thinking taught in the government schools I was forced to attend. (not much education either, so most of the education I've gotten that has economic value was self taught.)<p>I actually pay taxes, and I have relocated my ass and my business to a jurisdiction that I find more favorable.  My only point here is to try and get you to see the immorality of the situation and thus the error in the rationalization that you've been given.  Not that I think it will change anything if I convince you.",1296048335

What I am talking about is more <i>fundamental</i> in this discussion.  Here I am drawing directly from Tannen, and she's right:<p>Okay, in my scenario, in middle school at lunch a boy, all excited about some technical topic he just learned, say, the TCP part of TCP/IP, tries to explain the topic to a girl.  Likely he will not get a good reception for, say, four reasons:<p>(1) She's a girl, knows that she's a young women, and is reluctant to <i>interact</i> with males her age or older without a good reason.  She has been warned by older women that such interactions have a tough tine being just casual because the male can easily start pursuing more.  So, she is <i>selective</i>.  Maybe if the boy is 1-2 years younger she will feel less threat and be more ready to be <i>just friends</i>.<p>(2) He's all fired up about the technical topic.  Sorry, but boys have strong desires to master any technical topics around them that appear important.  In part there is a lot of <i>innate curiosity</i>.  Why?  Exercise.  Sorry:  It's rare for girls to do that.  For how an automobile differential works, there is something wrong when a boy is not wildly curious or when a girl cares at all unless, say, being able to give a description will get the her something else she wants, say, an A, and thus praise and approval from others, on a test in middle school general science.<p>(3) Females make connections with others, and more generally get acceptance in groups, by <i>gossip</i> where they express their feelings.  Boys are taught to keep their feelings suppressed as in ""How you <i>feel</i> about it is just irrelevant."".  So, what the boy is trying to give the girl is not really girl gossip and, thus, is not liked by the girl.<p>(4) Males make connections by sharing information, especially, <i>neat, cool,</i> technical information.  So, that is what the boy is trying to do.  The girl doesn't give a weak little hollow hoot about technical information (for it's own sake).<p>Here (1) was your observation; for (2) I'll let you justify that yourself; (3) and (4) are directly from Tannen.<p>Lesson for girls who want to be <i>more like boys</i> in computer science:<p>You have heard about <i>virtual memory</i>.  Now, any boy with any hope at all of liking Hacker News, will be eager beyond belief, and thrilled enough to jump out of his skin, for any even small bit of information about why virtual memory and how it works.  When they get into page-segment tables, look-aside associative memory translation buffers, least recently used techniques, how I/O makes the virtual to real translations, and the shockingly low average execution time overhead, etc., then they will grow two feet taller instantly and have a ""Eureka!"" experience.<p>Similarly for <i>closure</i> in programming languages, binary search, the Gleason bound, the TCP part of TCP/IP, multi-protocol label switching (MPLS, used in the <i>core</i> and <i>backbone</i> of the Internet), and much more.  They'd rather understand such stuff than eat, sleep, play sports, watch a movie, or sit in class.  They really, really, really want to learn this stuff, all of it they can, whenever they can.  The first time they get to see a tower case with the sides off will be one of the most exciting moments in their life.<p>Girls:  If you want to do computing, go for it.  It's clean, indoor work with no heavy lifting.  Don't need gloves, masks, or special clothes.  A computer for less than $1000, a good Internet connection, and a lot of time alone with the computer are a lot of what you need from the beginning into quite high competency.<p>To get to the ""pay window"" (JLM at AVC.com), right now you go to the head of the line, well ahead of all the boys with similar qualifications:<p>(1) The hottest thing in computing now is <i>social media</i>, and there in conceptualizing the opportunities the girls should be knocking the socks off the boys.  Uh, much of Facebook, with over 500 million users and worth over $50 billion, is about gossip where boys can at best try to use a telescope from Mars to look at Venus.  Larry Page just said that 99% of <i>social search</i> has yet to be done; so, what's in this 99% that would be good to do now?<p>(2) Learn how to bring up a corresponding Web site.  The site will need some <i>graphic design</i> where girls are much better than the boys (25% of whom are partially red-green color blind and likely still draw both trees and people as stick figures).  The site will need a good <i>user interface</i> and <i>user experience</i> (UI/UX), and here girls should totally knock the socks off the boys.  The site will need some text, and, again, girls are much better at not just typing and spelling but at writing for emotional effect -- knock the socks off the boys.  Still more important, girls are much better than the boys at writing and correctly estimating the reactions of others.  E.g., I'm a man, here am just writing ideas, and clearly don't have even a clue about how others will react!  Maybe I don't even care, but girls both care and know, and that's a big advantage.<p>(3) Once the site goes live, you will need to get some <i>publicity</i>:  ""I don't know if you know who runs that business, but I assure you it's not the Boy Scouts.""  (Dangerfield in <i>Back to School</i>).  Neither is it the mafia, but it is women.<p>(4) Older men with big bucks tend very much to want to help women.  No joke.  Not just into bed or to be a Daddy Warbucks or Svengali.  So, Fred Wilson, Brad Feld, and Mark Suster have all been loud and clear on their blogs about how happy they are to fund women.  May find much the same at KPCB and Sequoia.  You are at the head of the line; the door is being held open for you.  HP was thrilled to have Carly Fiorina and Patricia Dunn.  Yahoo was thrilled to get Carol Bartz.<p>Go for it!",1296047492

I recently purchased the 'Humble Indie Bundle 2' games package which was available for all platforms.  This was offered on a 'pay what you want' basis and, after deciding how much you would pay and purchasing the games, they provided some very interesting data:<p><a href=""http://i.imgur.com/Cn5vX.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://i.imgur.com/Cn5vX.jpg</a><p>In this case (maybe it's unusual?) Linux users were willing to (voluntarily) fork out more cash for these games than either Windows or Mac users.  Perhaps it's because payment wasn't strictly necessary or something, I don't know.  I suspect that Linux users, as a community, are closer to the software-development community, so when good software is made (without a bunch of insulting DRM) at a reasonable price, they're more than happy to pay for it.",1296047460

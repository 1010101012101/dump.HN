For me, a blog ought to be a put-everything-that-doesn't-fit-in-an-essay place. Wordpress is decent for that, but Tumblr makes it very easy for me to share things that I've found and to write about them. I can write a lot in a day and get a bunch of great scraps that focus my eventual piece. Further: all due respect to Wordpress, but Tumblr is beautiful. It's one of the best-designed sites I've ever seen.<p>The great thing about Tumblr is you can use it for anything. You can use it like you would Twitter, you could get images like you would on Ffffound, you can make it into a lengthy posting place, or a portfolio, or a jukebox. It's extremely versatile. And it uses the opt-in approach of seeing people, so you can build whatever community you want and still get fascinating results.",1229017522

Both of us had excellent jobs.<p>The clincher that made us quit was when it became perfectly clear that those jobs, or their equivalent, are readily available should we fail. If the worst, worst case scenario is the status quo, why not go for it?",1204343895

However, if you actually want the general public to come visit, then get yourself some cheap hosting.",1204341284
126527,comment,126480,126515,0,0,Electro,,,"slicehost.com is the best I've seen for a VPS so far, $20 beginner. They also say they're negotiable on bandwidth starting at $0.30/GB, which is a bonus if you're running a popular blog and for some reason need more than 100GB bandwidth.<p>As for power, you've always got UPS'.<p>Internet is the tricky one as all private hosts use redundancies, although I don't see why you couldn't sign up for regular internet and a cable connection.<p>I've seen a handful of ISPs that let you run a server (or more correctly, don't stop you), although I think most ISPs prohibit it to force you onto business packages (which you can get in your home too).<p>I know in the Toronto region there is Mountain Cable, which doesn't have anything in their Terms of Service preventing you, and have unlimited bandwidth (From speed tests I've seen, they're faster than Cogeco, and get an upload speeds in the 1+MB/s range). I think you've just got to settle with DynDNS, however from what I've read this is reccomended for static IP's too. If you did have two ISPs then this would solve the IP problem when you switch.<p>I'm actually considering going with Mountain Cable anyway as they're cheaper than Cogeco. Although their lack of information on their website freaks me out; I mean their service area map isn't even online. (Edit: They do have a service area map for their internet, however they apparently provide service outside of the area)",1204341238

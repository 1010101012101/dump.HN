7766248,comment,7763957,7764737,1,0,beagle3,,,"> The effect is that implementations must sacrifice either security (by not being able to use public key derivation techniques that improve security) or compatibility (by ending up with private keys that don&#x27;t have the high bit set and being unable to use the widely distributed fast curve25519 code).<p>How does that follow? I&#x27;m not a crypto expert, but I would think you would derive your keys whichever way you want, except at length one bit shorter, and then add the &#x27;1&#x27; bit; Or, equivalently, derive it at the length you want and then set the top bit to 1. If your KDF is foiled by reducing one bit of information from the output, wasn&#x27;t it bad to start with?",1400486375

I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve watched live TV in 10 years.<p>I&#x27;m looking to cut my cord, but the problem is that nothing legit is as convenient as the cable+DVR setup. With those 2 things I have access to practically <i>every</i> TV show on the air (minus Netflix exclusive stuff).<p>To have access to that wide of a library without cable I need Netflix, Hulu, Amazon Prime, iTunes (and Pirate Bay for the stuff that&#x27;s just impossible to get). There is not a single (non-computer) device that can play those all on my TV. So it&#x27;s a bit of a hassle, screwing around to find what service on what device has what show and then remembering when the new ones come out.<p>Compare that to the stupid, but venerable, DVR where every show I want from whatever random channel just shows up when it comes out in one clean interface.<p>I want to kill it so bad but from a UX perspective, it&#x27;s just so much better.<p>Really, the only thing that gets close to that experience at all is flexget[1] + a private torrent tracker. How sad is that? It really should be a huge kick in the nuts to all the legit streaming services, but I doubt that they even care... DRM just ruins everything.

MySpace was mainstream, but Facebook was a more serious consideration because (at least as I remember it) it didn&#x27;t allow the quagmire of horrific CSS crud MySpace did. It felt mature and accessible. I remember the &#x27;social media marketing&#x27; of Heroes S1, where the kid characters had MySpace accounts and the politician had a Facebook account. Equally millions had used DOS before, but Windows got to people who didn&#x27;t want to touch the command line.

There&#x27;s a big difference.<p>If you just need auto-completion, modal dialogs and similar features then you shouldn&#x27;t build a web application, and you definitely should make your site work without Javascript.<p>On the other hand, if you are building Google Maps, then you should build a web application. Google Maps doesn&#x27;t work when you disable Javascript.<p>Supporting clients without Javascript in web applications often doesn&#x27;t make sense. If it does, you should consider building a standard web site. Just imagine building Google Maps without Javascript. Or better yet, imagine using a version of Google Maps without Javascript. I&#x27;m sure that there are people that could pull that off and still end up with something good but it&#x27;s not the case for most teams (not enough time, resources or skill) building web applications.<p>[0]: What&#x27;s considered Javascript-heavy anyways? I think that including support for standard stuff like auto-completion, modal dialogs or even just including bootstrap&#x27;s javascript these days makes your site Javascript-heavy.<p>[1]: By this I mean a single page web application that uses Javascript for state management/routing, rendering, communication with the backend, etc. You should be able to deploy an application like this on S3 and it should work. That&#x27;s not a requirement but I&#x27;m just trying to point out that it&#x27;s an application built completely with Javascript, with no backend support (except for the api that it communicates with).",1400486057

The ring signature its using has been peer reviewed, though the partial uncloaking technique they use to prevent double spending is a novel application.<p>(And come on, I&#x27;m not usually one to lean on authority— but you ought to believe /me/ when I say it&#x27;s not copying Bitcoin and that it&#x27;s doing something very useful and interesting for cryptographic privacy)<p>The privacy achieved by Bytecoin is better than any existing-in-production privacy tools (e.g. CoinJoin) and also as good as or better than every theoretical system I&#x27;ve heard proposed except for Zerocash. Relative to ZeroCash, Bytecoin exists today and has simpler cryptographic assumptions, better performance for signers, and no requirement for trusted initialization. Because it doesn&#x27;t mask values its anonymity set is potentially smaller, though the implementation does some clever denomination tricks to reduce the harm of value transparency.<p>The reason I included a hyperlink instead of just speaking comparatively was so that you wouldn&#x27;t have to suffer from any confusion on the matter. :)<p>Kinda sad that with all the worthless clonecoin and whitepapercoin pumping people are missing the few bits of real innovation that are getting created, enh?

Doing so does require cooking and a bit of planning.  Obviously, filet mignon is off the menu, but you&#x27;d be surprised what still is. Also, (properly chosen) real food is proven while Soylent is not.<p>So, what is the niche for Soylent?<p>People who know about nutrition know that you probably shouldn&#x27;t trust the claims Soylent makes until it&#x27;s been on the market for a while.  People who know how and are willing to cook economically probably don&#x27;t want to risk their health on an unproven product that won&#x27;t save them money (currently). People who are largely ignorant of nutrition and eat ramen and Kraft Dinner daily probably won&#x27;t want to give up the taste they&#x27;d be missing out on, nor pay <i>extra</i> for it.<p>There are a few crazy people who will adopt Soylent as their primary staple, but the majority of business will likely be from people looking for novelty or an occasional time-saving meal replacement. Basically the meal-shake crowd.  What&#x27;s the best way to appeal to this segment?  Claim that your product can be eaten daily without causing health-problems, just as Soylent is currently doing. Future variants might include calorically reduced versions for the diet crowd or a protein-boosted version for the (wannabe)body-builder crowd.  There&#x27;s plenty of commercial opportunity here.<p>Will Soylent actually change the world for the poor though?  If they can bring the price down Soylent might make a difference with the educated poor, but that&#x27;s a very small segment of the population.

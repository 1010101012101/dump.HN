I think that is as important as anything in terms of the Ordered List employees being happy as Github employees.  In many cases the acquirer is several orders of magnitude larger than the acquiree, and I think that is what leads to the ""suck"" associated with being acquired.<p>I worked at a company of 200 employees that was acquired by a company of 200,000 employees, and it was a bad enough experience that I promised myself I'd never work for a big company again, and that if I ever worked for a company that was acquired by a big company, I'd start a new job search immediately.<p>I think this is fairly standard practice, but I've only been through it once.  When we were acquired, management came up a with a set of timelines and associated goals.  30 days, 90 days, 6 months, 1 year.  None of the short term goals were that big of a deal.  Log in to the new HR system.  Do a sexual harassment training.  It was the longer term ""synergy targets"" that were the killers.  Tracking every minute of your day to a project.  New project management techniques and new project managers.  No more input from engineers on new features.  It happens slowly enough that you don't just walk in one day and realize you're working at a different company; it's more insidious than that.  I'll never put myself through it again.",1326080144

My last work term was in Sunnyvale, came with a $5,000 US a month salary, $1000 monthly rent allowance, $400 a month car allowance, plus a travel allowance for 2 trips home. Upon graduation, most of my class went into ""real"" roles at their companies, none of this entry level bullshit that usually beckons for new grads who have never shipped code before and can't be trusted to handle anything north of double checking bug reports. Finally, the variety of work experiences helps you find a niche in terms of the types of projects and companies you'd like to be associated with post graduation. It's a giant red flag to see employees move on to new gigs every 4 months after graduation, so even if you hate your job you're somewhat obligated to stick around for at least a year to prove you're capable of fulfilling a ""commitment"".

This isn't about the job you are going to be doing, this is about getting me to even consider you for a job.<p>To answer your questions though:<p>(1) I'd expect you to continue doing open source, as both part of the job and on your own. I do it, so should you. Case in point, we just integrated our site with WePay. WePay didn't have Java API, so I wrote one (along with my business partner) and we made it open source [a]. This benefited my company, open source and WePay all in one shot. This isn't the only one, I can point at many more large projects [b], [c], [d] (for just a short list) that we've either open sourced ourselves or contributed to. I have a clear history of coding in multiple languages. Anyone who is going to hire me knows my skill set without having to give me silly brain teasers or even read a resume. Why would anyone want to hire someone without a clear record like that?<p>(2) How you spend your time is up to you. There is a certain amount of work that needs to get done as part of the job and I'd expect that to get done. As long as you are getting your work done, in a reasonable time and of a good quality, I'm fine with whatever you do with your time. If that 'policy' doesn't leave you with enough energy, then I'd suggest either learning how to do better time management or find another profession / company.<p>As I already said, I wouldn't hire someone without seeing their source code. The single best way to really see it is to see how they've contributed and worked with open source projects. Bonus points if you find a unique project to create yourself.<p>[a] <a href=""https://github.com/lookfirst/WePay-Java-SDK"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/lookfirst/WePay-Java-SDK</a>

I would argue that a company that comes out against the SOPA does it more out of interest in having control over its content, what it does and not having a monopolistic third-party shut them down. They do it for survival of themselves first.<p>I'm sure that most of them care about internet freedom (after all, companies are composed of people who have their own freedom of expression); and if it didn't affect them whatsoever, I'm sure that many companies would take a stand against the SOPA and we'd be in the same position as we are now.<p>Of course, companies that have supported the bill have done so out of interest in having control of their 'material.' So we have two different points of view, one for and one against. However, both come from a need for control of content (some would call it greed, but that has negative connotations which I don't feel like addressing.)<p>My comment that you replied to has nothing to do with companies supporting or not supporting the SOPA, for freedom or not, but rather that some politicians (see the ones who support the SOPA) see things from an individual standpoint: i.e., they support business freedom except when it interferes with either their supporters (MPAA, RIAA, etc.) or what they 'believe' in. In other words, they want their cake and they want to eat it too.",1326078358

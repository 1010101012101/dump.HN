3286825,comment,3286399,3286399,15,0,nikcub,,,"Great post. I would add:<p>* the site module, which is imported by default and is what is responsible for setting up the default sys.path. You can skip 'import site' by running python with the -S switch. the site module is written in python, so you can scan through it and understand how python starts up and inits.<p>* PYTHONSTARTUP env variable, which points to a python file that is run (like a bashrc, or AUTOEXEC.BAT, if you prefer) on interactive prompt startup. I use this to import custom paths and modules that I want to access from the REPL, such as Google App Engine<p>* I use pip with local repositories. clone the repos of the libs you need, and then pip install in the virtualenv from that local clone:<p><pre><code>    $ pip install git+file:///Users/nik/.python-packages/tornado\n</code></pre>\n(note the triple slash). Or straight from GH:<p><pre><code>    $ pip install git+git://nikcub@github.com/nikcub/tornado\n</code></pre>\nthis can keep your versions in sync across all projects and virtualenvs and it means no re-downloading and you can setup and update projects while offline.<p>* don't store the actual project inside the virtualenv. the virtualenv provides the execution context (setup and torn down using the virtualenvwrapper helper scripts). a common practice is to place all your virtualenvs into a directory like ~/.virtualenvs. you should never have to cd into this dir, access it using the wrappers and pip. (edit: also agree with comment below that you shouldn't be sudo'ing).<p>* just a quick add, I think it is definitely worth learning how to install python from source.",1322502790

My English monolingual classmates minds were blown by things like noun cases and the vocative. <i>That</i> is why you learn those languages (arguably Sanskrit, Chinese, Arabic, or any other language with a rich history also fits the bill).<p>In this sense, learning Latin or Greek is similar to learning Lisp: sure you'll not use it in your daily life (I know, many will differ on that), but, boy, does it open your mind up.<p>Unfortunately, these languages are taught by people who are generally English majors, not Linguistics or CS majors and so focus on the literature as opposed to cool grammar.

I used MyFitnessPal to keep track of my diet for the first month or so. It's great because you can scan the bar code and 9 times out of 10 the nutrition facts are already there. I go back and track my food one day every other week or so to make sure I'm still sticking to good eating habits.<p>However, starting with only the concept of calories in - calories out actually winds up being more difficult. If you have a candy bar and a soda today, you just wasted 400 of your calories. You mentioned a 1,000 calorie deficit, which is where I was at and I was eating 1,200-1,400 per day. So, you essentially just ate 30% of your calories on items that will not make you feel satiated at all. In fact, they often times will make you feel more hungry and lead to sugar spikes.<p>Now, compare that to someone who cares about healthy eating. You could eat: 6 ounces of chicken with salsa on it, grilled bell peppers, a piece of whole grain bread, a handful of almonds, and more broccoli and spinach then you could feasibly eat in one sitting. Eating healthy makes you more full (which makes the 16 hour fasts very easy to follow through on) and gives you better macros for fat/carbs/protein.<p>I eat more now than I have ever eaten before, and all I had to do was change the contents of my meals a bit.",1322501918

Spread Spectrum isn't some magic buzzword that you can throw in there and it instantly fixes all our technological woes.  Yes, it works, up to a point, up to a fixed amount of traffic on any particular channel, but when you start getting into denser populations, you need to start getting more complex.  general wi-fi tends to crap out if there are too many (around 13) operators in the vicinity, cell towers in urban areas need to handle hundreds, if not thousands of calls at any one time. (yes I realize that isn't the best analogy, as the technologies are quite different) And wi-fi sucks up a big chunk of the unlicensed 2.4Ghz spectrum. Then you start to get into the question of bandwidth, if you want more users, they are each going to have less bw, thus you can advertise your 100mbs bw for 4G, but if any more than one person is using it, you download speed is going drop fast.<p>Now i do agree that it'd be nice to have one standard, and open up all these frequencies for common use.  But it's more than just big brother out there holding fast to the status quo.  Companies use very different technologies. (especially in the States)  Companies like Qualcom (Verizon/Sprint CDMA technology) invest enormous sums of money into protecting their IP, and aren't about to share it, just so that AT&T customers can use their spectrum. Yes, there is a merge towards LTE, but by an large, there is still the CDMA/TDMA divide between companies, and the use of propriety chipsets means that two different technologies can't really share the same spectrum, as there really is so much traffic on each channel, SS isn't going guarantee there is no interference.

See for example [1], which shows excellent correlations between AFQT (the US Army's IQ-like test) scores and post-military wage (not to mention many specific objectively graded tasks within the armed forces).<p>(Note that IQ test-retest scores tend to be highly correlated - it's rare that a child scoring 1 stdev below the mean will later score 1 stdev above the mean.)<p><i>In the particular case of math proofs (which I think you're referring to) you have the additional issue that (I think - I'm not a mathematician) proofs often require intuitive leaps...Teaching intuition/pattern-matching is of course really hard.</i><p>True. But nevertheless, some students pick it up immediately while others never do. The question arises, why?<p>Also, as for what is ""well accepted"", there are lots of things in the field of education that are well accepted but false. For example, people widely believe that test prep significantly improves SAT scores [2]. They also believe school quality (rather than % of Asian students) explains many of the differences in test outcomes between US schools and Asian schools [3]. See also Bryan Caplan's book [4] which shows lots of evidence that most of what is done to children before age 18 has little effect on adult outcomes.<p>So if you have evidence that public schools and private schools significantly affect outcomes, go ahead and post it.

I have personally had the experience of having a flight attendant ask me to put away my kindle because I wasn't paying attention to the announcements.<p>As I've explained elsewhere in this topic, aviation mishaps are almost always the result of multiple factors, where if any one factor had been removed the mishap would not have occurred.  ""Passenger with unauthorized active RF transmitter"" could be one source, but it's probably not going to cause a mishap alone.<p>In aviation we define ""risk"" as a combination of probability and severity.  You can drive down the risk for a particular hazard by either lowering the probability or lowering the severity.  The only way to completely eliminate risk is to not fly, so every flight involves accepting some level of risk.  It's really a question of residual risk you're willing to accept balanced against the costs (financial and otherwise) incurred by attempts to further reduce the risk.  Several people in this topic have discussed the costs of just the current system of having everyone turn off their phones during critical phases of flight, and complaining that the FAA doesn't apparently care about such things.  I disagree with them--if the FAA truly didn't care, they would do exactly what you say: confiscate all electronics at the gate and lock them in a shielded box.<p>><i>It just strikes me as odd that failure to pass an EMC SOFT grounds the plane until the issue is debugged, but then they just allow an random passenger to bring any random radio aboard just so long as they promise/remember to turn it off during critical phases of the flight.</i><p>Keep in mind that I'm flying in a developmental test environment.  That means that we're dealing with a lot of stuff that has never flown before, or are using it in ways it has never been used before.  Because of the nature of what we're doing, we already have a lot of risk baked into our flights that an ordinary flight does not have, so we tend to be a lot more conservative about the risk factors that we can control.<p>[EDIT to add quote for context]",1322501690

XSS sanitization can be difficult to get right as it ties in closely with the parsing behavior of the browser. This paper explains some of the subtleties of ensuring correct sanitization, as well as common pitfalls. We study several emerging web application frameworks including those presently used for development of commercial web applications. We evaluate how effective these frameworks are in guarding against the common pitfalls of sanitization. We find that while some web frameworks safeguard against the empirically relevant use cases, most do not. In addition, some of the security features in present web frameworks provide a false sense of security.",1322501207

Nobody ever had an idea of a number being ""irrational"" until Pythagoras attempted to measure the diagnonal of a square and discovered that it could not be represented as a fraction.

But I'd disagree with pretty strenuously with both credit score and IQ and would walk away immediately if a potential employer asked for these.<p>Re credit score: In the US this appears to be legal in some states, illegal in others, so as an employer I'd investigate carefully before asking asking for a credit dscore. But outside of of a banking industry job or a situation where one is attempting to obtain security clearance, this is pretty egregious. Plenty of families have had their credit wrecked by the recession and there are lots of reasons (e.g. unforeseen medical problems) that could result in a lowered score that have no predictive value whatsoever. So, even if what you're doing is legal in your locality, it's morally dubious outside of a certain types of jobs. Finally, it looks like this can cut both ways: ""If you do agree to let [a prospective employer] see the report, and they base their decision not to hire you on something in it, you have the right under the Fair Credit Reporting Act to see it, says EFLs Meschke.

It's not that it has _no_ predictive value, but that there are a lot of confounding factors (e.g. the country you were raised in). Furthermore results need to be interpreted very carefully and I don't necessarily trust an employer to do that. I think a lot of people would rightfully see this is intrusive.<p>Having interviewed a fair number of job candidates in my time, I agree it's hard and there is definitely an art to it.

There are many other ways it could have happened, such as multiple simultaneous invention, aesthetic choices that are in fact constricted by physical analogs, conventions, and prior customer experience. If you believe that the iPhone has hit a local maximum for design, why not believe that other manufacturers are hillclimbing toward them with the same algorithm?",1322499607

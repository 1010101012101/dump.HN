430229,comment,429477,429477,0,0,iigs,,,"Disclaimer: not particularly a power user. Problem also probably more of a UI/UX issue than a technical issue.<p>From time to time when I'm working in excel I'll find I've derived an answer from a couple adjacent input cells and several intermediate calculation step cells below. As a contrived example, lets say I have pennies per number of hours and I want to convert to dollars per year. I'll start with hours per year (365.25*24) and divide that by the input ""number of hours"". Then I'll divide the input ""number of pennies"" by 100 to get dollars. Then I'll multiply the two together to get my output.<p>Without fail after working through a problem like this I will want to make a 2-D grid with an input variable on each axis and have the results filled into the grid. Unfortunately because I just did it using a bunch of intermediate cells I can't copy and paste, drag and fill, or any of the other intuitive mechanisms. To date the only solution I've found to this problem is to re-do all of my work in VBA as a single function and use =myFn(colval,rowval) in each cell.<p>There are a couple ways this could play out. One of which would be to call subordinate sheets (or chunks of sheets) as functions. This is how I've envisioned it in my head. It would be a terrible pain to make that work, and I'd be afraid it would confuse people who wouldn't understand which cells worked normally and which cells were function components.<p>Another solution would be to select an output cell and have it refactor it to a function that could be called. This is probably a lot easier to do, but might not be as maintainable by the kinds of people that don't understand VBA -- they could keep the ""source code"" cells around and recompile when changes are made, but all of the standard code generator / manual edit problems apply.",1231743559

Compared to some european countries with good healthcare systems, the US spends substantially more (~15% vs ~9% of GDP) covers substantially fewer people (the millions without coverage) and the overall health of the population is poorer. By nearly all objective measures, a good public system is much better than an all-private system and yet, we know this is not compatible with libertarian ideology - you will have to search far and wide to find a libertarian group that supports a public healthcare system.<p>I haven't been feeling my best lately.[1]  I apologize for not supporting my argument, but I believe Chile has a reasonably good healthcare system, where the rich go to the private system and the rest go to the public system.<p>[1] I just moved to the US from Chile.",1231742692

430203,comment,428785,429884,0,0,grandalf,,,"Why is perfect information required?<p>If I walk into a bank and consider depositing my hard earned cash, perhaps I'd demand enough transparency to determine whether to trust that entity with my cash, in exactly the same way that I must trust Amazon when I place an order online, etc.<p>Information will always be imperfect, but it's in both parties' interest to increase transparency.  It's barely even a coordination problem in today's world.<p>As a note to your remark about my speed limit explanation, why is it then that on an extremely icy road people go exactly the posted speed limit rather than, say, 90 miles per hour?  Clearly they are taking the sign literally and at face value.<p>So one regulatory approach that would be an improvement over the current one might be to require a reserves ""rating"" to be published, much like the smoking causes cancer warning.  Perhaps right under the bank's logo it would have to say ""This bank has a reserve score of 71 (moderately risky)"".<p>And yes, there would be room for 3rd party ratings to be applied to bank solvency as well.  I'm not sure what the best approach would be, but consider that most securities regulations were made in the 20s before the information revolution (ironically, the ""Financial Services Modernization Act"" removed a few of the depression-era regs that were actually smart and prevented moral hazard and conflict of interest).  Surely there would be a lot of clever approaches.  One idea that intrigues me is that the government could offer its rating, but banks would be required to obtain several.  I'd love to see someone like Michael Moore create his own such agency and use his genius to publicize it.<p>Analogously, consider the FDA drug approval process.  Everyone knows that the FDA process is flawed, as people are routinely killed by side-effects of drugs.  So why not have several ratings:  One from a consortium of insurers, one from the AMA, and one from the FDA -- each group has a slightly different downside risk (and upside) to approving a dangerous drug or failing to approve a safe one in a timely fashion.  Why not have a grid of 3 checkboxes on every drug.  The absence of an AMA approval might be a warning sign to some, but not others.<p>If you think this idea is silly, consider what happens when the FDA gets it wrong and lots of people die because of a drug... exactly nothing but a too-late knee-jerk reaction.  Usually the drug is immediately pulled even if it has other valid uses, etc.  One perverse example: many doctors knew the dangers of Vioxx well before the scandal (the same risk exists in lesser form with all such drugs, even Ibuprofen) and good ones didn't use it on patients at risk for bleeding without great caution.  Yet it took a few years and then bang, it's gone from shelves even though there are a few essentially identical drugs that stayed on the market and do still occasionally kill people when used without caution by docs.<p>I'm not claiming to have the whole idea of optimal regulation for the 21st century figured out, but I'm just brainstorming.  Surely there would be a lot of great and clever ideas.  The current, one-size-fits-all approach leads to massive and often ineffectual regulatory apparatus.<p>Why shouldn't coming up with ad-hoc regulatory / information-dissemination / transparency-reducing systems be something that startups do?  Why not in the case of medical trials have data published to the web so that people can make mash-ups with all the data that is being considered by regulators?  A few weeks ago the SEC approved a plan to put financials in XML format, but it's all very primitive and is unlikely to be all that useful, but the core idea of transparency through an API is a good one, I think.<p>The role of the ""regulator"" of the future, I think, is to design a good API spec (metaphorically and literally) and possibly make a list of all of the watchdog groups offering analysis.  State and federal governments could fund their own watchdog groups too -- maybe I notice that Wyoming's prescription-drug watchdog group has been right a bunch of times in a row, so I begin trusting it more than the one in my own state.  Maybe I decide to trust Michael Moore's group or Paul Graham's.  Over time the best would rise to the top and every mistake would give new groups a chance to enter the limelight -- maybe a YC startup was the only one not to approve Vioxx, for example.<p>Toward the libertarian goal of efficient, small government, we should be focusing on regulation that increases transparency and also increases the number of entities that can act as private watchdogs.  It's exceptionally telling that the SEC received repeated complaints about Madoff's fund from various sources and still did nothing.  One might argue that the SEC is understaffed, but it found the staff to shut down prosper.com, a startup that was making humanity better off, on a technicality, not even on any remote accusation of fraud.  More likely, prosper.com competed with the established finance powerhouses, so the SEC was probably just acting to keep competition out of the industry.<p>Most of what all of the regulatory agencies do is coordinate information, and if the modern world (and the internets) have done one thing, it's make such problems extremely easy and inexpensive to solve.  My basic argument is that the antiquated structures create a false sense of security and get in the way, as well as soak up tons of industry lobbying dollars to the point where industries tend to become highly regulated and highly protected, the two biggest characteristics of libertarian dystopia.  The military industrial complex and now the financial and auto industries are that sort of thing.  Big agriculture is too, as well as many others.",1231741814

you with the people around you.""<p>Isn't that kind of ... anti-social. Social science dictates that the best way for anyone to connect with people around is offline. Meetup, have a beer, dine-out, and talk!",1186077163

A network that doesn't transmit any content (and exists mostly to network) is useless.<p>I wrote a little about that as it applies to reddit (and LinkedIn): <a href=""http://www.byrneseyeview.com/byrnes_eye_view/the_tragedy_of_the_common_all.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.byrneseyeview.com/byrnes_eye_view/the_tragedy_of_...</a>",1186076907

The reason I keep coming back to this thread is not because I want to win an argument, but because I might be wrong.<p>I agree with you that drawing the ethical line wherever it is most convenient is bad. In fact, I have discussed or debated ethics online a few times in the past, and I was always in your position, saying that the issue is black and white no matter how convenient it would be otherwise. Perhaps this is why I am so interested in this thread, now that I am on the other end of it.<p>Anyway, thanks for your insight. Although I am still not convinced that anything I did was unethical, I will think twice before looking at past work again.",1186076057

Like a really simplified RSS reader (either a desktop app or web app) that uses the current technology to let you know when things have changed on arbitrary websites. I could see a lot of people being interested in something like that who have no clue what RSS is.",1186075042

38769,comment,38485,38657,0,0,menloparkbum,,,"Software is not mentioned under any copyright law. Thus most ownership clauses contracts will NOT hold up in court. And as randallsquared said, most of the time ownership isn't even mentioned. I'm astonished by engineers who think this is some cut and dried issue, like NickB who points out that what Juwo mentions is ""illegal"" when it isn't. If it was illegal, you could make a reference a law. <p>Software copyright and ownership issues are murky. If they were clear cut, would Facebook be running right now?<p>Facebook is a great example. It depends on who you believe, but it appears that Mark Zuckerburg worked on a site that was similar to Facebook, but geared towards Harvard students. For whatever reason, he bailed and started Facebook, which was pretty much the same thing, only with a bigger scope, and better. <p>If he stole some PHP code, is that unethical? If he stole the idea, is that unethical? What if the guys he was working with were idiots who didn't really care, and were going to only pay attention to their rinky-dink site when they weren't at rowing practice? Is it unethical to grab someone elses idea and run with it when you know they are just going to let it lay fallow?",1186074825

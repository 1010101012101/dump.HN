The mere act of trying to predict reality to further some end means you have an emotional objective. The universe can get along just fine without you, you know.<p>Also, how do you determine when your rules have accurately predicted reality? Can you measure your own confirmation bias or congruence bias? Can you be sure that you've rid yourself of your bias blind spot when you make the connection between your mental model and what you perceive as reality?<p>There are not turtles all the way down. At some level you enter the exciting, terrifying, wonderful, and dangerous world of raw human emotion. Emotions aren't antiquated. They are the turbulent foundation upon which rationality stands. I'm not saying that rationality is baseless or impossible. I'm just saying that you cannot set it apart as a motivational engine that supersedes human passion. I see it more as a system that helps you make effective use of your emotional energy.<p>Additionally, you can't set up your definition of rationality (a set of self-consistent rules that allow you to accurately predict reality) as a system that encourages morality (rejecting things like torture or other needless suffering, as you said above).",1222270686

313606,comment,313384,313513,0,0,time_management,,,"His rationale is not incorrect but incomplete.<p>Essentially, he's arguing that since the Benford distribution of leading digits is the sole fixed point under the scaling operation, it's the most natural distribution to expect in large collection of measurements. Since units of measurement (e.g. dollars, meters, miles) represent arbitrary quantities, and the data set could be examined using literally any unit of measure (a unit of measure being a scaling operation, e.g. meters -> feet multiplies each datum by 3.26), a sufficiently large set of measured data (e.g. an almanac) can be expected to obey Benford's distribution.<p>Benford's Law is also not true of specific distributions that are very tight. Consider IQ. That the mean is 100 is completely arbitrary, but the standard deviation of ~15% is not. Observed ratio IQs in healthy children are log-normal with a multiplicative standard deviation of 1.15-1.16; in other-words, the 85th-percentile 6-year-old will have the cognitive maturity of an average 7-year-old, a fact that is independent of the unit of measure. (Adult ""deviation IQs"" are a different matter entirely, as they are ""forced"" to conform to a normal distribution, e.g. a person who scores in the 99.0th percentile will be ""assigned"" a z-score of 2.33, corresponding to an IQ of 135.) Obviously, with 50% of IQs having a leading digit of 1 and almost none having a leading digit of 2 or 3, this is not a Benford distribution. You could use a different arbitrary scaling factor, setting the median to 50 instead of 100, but then leading digits of 5 and 6 would be overrepresented, with virtually no 1s or 2s. The issue, of course, is that normal IQs are very tightly distributed in the log-space and don't span nearly an order of magnitude, so we will never get a Benford distribution no matter what scaling factor we choose.<p>The other problem with the OP's argument is that it doesn't apply to figures like fatality figures in natural disasters, or sizes of cities, neither of which involves an arbitrary unit, but both of which exhibit Benford-esque distributions, due to the <i>multiplicative</i> rather than <i>additive</i> compilation of the variables involved. An additive compilation (e.g. sum) of a large number of variables (e.g. height from genes) exhibits a normal distribution, for which Benford's Law does not apply. However, a multiplicative compilation (e.g. product) of a large number of random variables will have a log-normal distribution, and if the variation of X is over many orders of magnitude, its distribution will be locally flat enough (in the log-space) that Y - floor(Y), where Y = log X, will be approximately a uniform choice out of [0, 1), leading to the Benford distribution.",1222270188

If that value is picked randomly, you have 8/10 chance of including the teens, 7/10 chance of including the twenties, etc. until you have a 1/10 chance of including the eighties, and an increasingly low chance of including the nineties. Then you choose a number from that range - what are the chances it begins with 1? Far greater than if it began with 9, since numbers that begin with 1 are included 8/10 of the time.<p>Does this make any sense? Is there something I've missed?",1222269450

As Howard Roarke, the protagonist in 'The Fountainhead' says, ""The world is perishing from an orgy of self-sacrificing.""<p>We don't need more altruism or nobless-oblige. We need more innovation. Google, who all but started the cloud computing model, is a leader in innovation. They should stick with what they are good at, technological innovation, and not have some kind of save the world guilt trip. The world benefits most by a Google that is focused on the one thing they are great at: search and a cloud computing dev environment.<p>Don't save us, google. Just keep up the good work. That way, by benefiting from your technology, we can save ourselves. :-)",1222269212

It doesn't apply exactly to <i>any</i> well-defined, real-world distribution (""physical constants"" is not a well-defined distribution) but it applies <i>approximately</i> to a good number of them.<p>Benford's Law is exactly true on 10^X, where X is a random variable, chosen with uniform probability, from [0, 1). It's also true with X chosen from [0, n) for any integer n, because the leading digit of 10^X relies only on the non-integral part of X. When X is chosen from some other distribution that spans many orders of magnitude (say, N(4, 1)) the distribution of the fractional part (X - floor(X)) is <i>approximately</i> a uniform random variable from [0, 1), so Benford's Law is approximately true.",1222269021

If you take a look at the planning tab, you'll see that it's not how you think it is.<p>It's simple:<p>1. You add a deadline by which time you expect some particular featureset to be completed (for example, the user interface)
2. The you add a bunch of features to that deadline (like toolbar, about box, etc).
3. You have a series of tasks for each feature that need to be completed like a standard todo list<p>Normal planning does not work for ISVs. But the approach above works (for me at least), because it allows you structure the way you approach your coding. It's not about traditional planning in any sense, it just a way of organising your todo lists in a manner that fits with the way that ISVs approach their products.",1222268907

Have you worked with independent software developers to identify the need you're satisfying with your product?  For my own case, at least, it's not that we've not the time or inclination to create detailed timelines or project plans, it's that we would find such things less than useless since we're frequently changing plans to better satisfy emerging user requirements.<p>To use a tortured analogy, large companies are like container ships plodding along a pre-defined course [they know exactly where they're going to be four weeks from now] whereas smaller developers are on the scale of Leif Erickson [we're headed 'thataway', hope to find something really valuable in the process, but realize we're going to have to change course every day to adapt to the winds, current and coastline we're discovering if we've any hope of surviving this adventure].  If you're enabling large-company planning processes for independent developers, there may be a mis-match in your marketing.<p>If you've not yet sat down with some small software companies to find out just what they would find helpful, I'd suggest you do so before proceeding further.

Apparently, no one only told HR that:<p>(1) ""Ivy League"" means absolutely nothing in the context of graduate programs, as the rankings are discipline-specific and many Ivy League grad programs are mediocre. For example, Harvard's computer science program is strong, but not remotely in the same league as CMU or UIUC.<p>(2) In any case, ""Ivy League"" is not a synonym for ""elite college""; well-regarded universities such as Stanford, MIT, and Michigan are (surprisingly?) not Ivy League.<p>(3) Related to (2), emphasizing ""Ivy League"" pisses off nearly everyone who went to a good college. Those who went to non-Ivy elites (like me) consider themselves excluded when they see these ads. Those who went to Ivy League colleges generally dislike the snooty, stuffy connotations of ""Ivy League"" and don't like the sorts of people who emphasize ""Ivy"".",1222268489

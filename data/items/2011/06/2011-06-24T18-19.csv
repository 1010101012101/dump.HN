The vast majority of non-technical users are just going to google for your company, so your example seems a little contrived.<p>The first part of the conversation would go more like this:<p>Hey, what's your new site?<p>grinnit with two n's. So grinn dot it.<p>However, there is definitely a problem when a search for ""grin it"" on google doesn't find your site. Moreover when a search for ""grin it photos"" or ""grinit photos"" is also unsuccessful. That's definitely a problem. If the spelling of your website isn't immediately obvious (a la reddit), you just need to ensure that users can still find your site.<p>I don't think it's a horrible name. Seeing it in print makes it instantly memorable which is always helpful, they just needed some additional work on seo for the typos of their name.

It's not the browser's fault, it's the fault of the people who made that app.<p>Mozilla's responsibility is indeed to provide reasonable backwards compatibility, but as long as that behavior is specified in the standard or as long as it benefits lots and lots of people.<p>But it is also Mozilla's responsibility to advance the state of the art, to implement new emerging standards and to fix their broken implementation, if needed of course. And let me tell you - Mozilla almost lost me to Chrome.<p>I also think your argument doesn't hold water as I've never seen Firefox behave badly on upgrades, ever since version 2. Sure, there might have been an incompatibility here and there, but I never ran into one and if it was, it was easily detectable if you just executed your app in Opera, or Chrome, or Safari, or another non-Gecko browser.<p>However, I suspect that this fear-mongering is from ""consultants"" and IT staff that are paid for support contracts and testing new versions of Firefox was part of their billable hours. And now they'll have to do more work supposedly testing Firefox.",1308941820

2693411,comment,2692985,2692985,56,0,ghshephard,,,"Absolutely zero surprise on my side.  VCs, and acquiring companies are always looking to maximize their return, as legally as possible during an M&A deal, even (sometimes particularly) if that means screwing over employees who are no longer with the company.<p>I actually like the honesty of this quote:<p>""Silver Lake declined to comment. When asked about Lees situation, Skype spokesman Brian OShaughnessy said, Youve got to be in it to win it. The company chose to include that clause in the contract in order to retain the best and the brightest people to build great products. This individual chose to leave, therefore he doesnt get that benefit.""<p>Most people will look at it and say ""What an Asswad"" - but at least he's not being a hypocrite.  That's precisely what everyone in the M&A team is _thinking_ they just aren't _saying_ it.<p>This is another take on what Oracle did when they bought Oblix (I had just left Oblix in 1999)  Oracle gave MegaBonuses to all the existing employees and executives, two of the founders, and paid absolutely nothing for the common shares.  The acquisition price was still $100Million plus, but there was only enough money to cover the preferred options + liquidation preferences in the ""on the record""  purchase prices.  Effectively, they wiped out all the employees who were common shareholders, but no longer with the company (or were part of the 15-20 out of 100 who were laid off during the acquisition)  while taking care of the VCs and the acquired employees.  (As a side bonus, they called the money they gave to the acquired employees ""Retention Bonuses"" - which resulted in the top people having to hang around for another year)<p>Lesson to be learned: When you leave a company, and it is still private - if they are Sold, instead of going public, there are probably any number of ways that you will get wiped out if you are no longer with them - possible exception if you are a founder with a significant percentage of the company, and you might be able to raise a stink for minority shareholder rights.  Then you'll get a ""consulting bonus"" to shut you up.<p>This story is more common than not.",1308941715

Sure, building a simple LAMP application will not help your CS chops like writing your own toy programming language will, but you might learn something along the way about Apache, PHP/Python, Linux, or MySQL that will help you in your career.  It also gives you a chance to question some of the fundamentals that have been with us for years - why do we use SQL for so many things?  Maybe a key/value store would work better for certain apps.<p>Just like a mechanical engineer might be able to design an engine that is easier to work on if he rebuilt an engine in a garage once or twice, a software engineer might be able to write code that is more easily maintainable if he installed WordPress once or twice.  Learning the difference between a good and a bad install procedure can at the very least help you write an installer that doesn't suck.",1308941476

Good eats.<p>I'm not formally a designer, but I fancy myself a fairly decent UX/UI guy and think I can offer some basic suggestions.<p>1) In your header, I would keep the Fishblab logo where it is, move the ""Map Driven Fishing Community"" tagline up next to/under the logo, and move the Login/New Account creation to the upper-right corner.  Then, move your menu down to where the tagline and login currently reside.  Right now, there's a lot of wasted space where the menu could be, and it seems awkwardly balanced to the left.<p>2) Remove the huge ""Fishblab"" logo in the main section.  It's redundant, and doesn't really do anything for the users.  What to put in its place? Add something for the user to do, like input their location or a type of fish they're looking for. Or, make this space a dynamic feed for other site content, like photos and forum posts.<p>3) Minimize your use of tag clouds.  These were cool a few years ago and you still see them a bit today, but users may be overwhelmed at the sheer amount of them on your homepage.  Think of your most prominent use cases for the site, and mold your homepage content around that.<p>4) Move the menu in the main section (Photos, Catch, etc.) over to the right or left side and turn them into actions the user can make.  Instead of ""Photos"", make it ""View and Submit Photos"" or something like that.<p>5) Please, please allow for authentication from other sites like Facebook and Twitter.  This will increase your trial and retention rates and allow you to leverage the size of those networks with your users and gain greater visibility.  Let people tweet stuff and post stuff to Facebook!<p>6) Not really a UX/UI thing but it'd be really cool if you pulled information from each state's Fish & Wildlife Department website. You could probably write a fairly simple program to pull this info and dynamically display it on your site according to the user's location.<p>I could make a dozen other small suggestions but they'd mostly be nitpicking and personal opinion.  Overall, I really like the concept and see a real need if there's nothing currently in this space (well, even if there is).  I see you guys as a sort of ""Yelp for fishermen""; you could probably take a few design and functional cues from their site to kickstart the ideation process.<p>Cheers and good luck!",1308940309

I realize there's probably a lot of app spam, and of course you want to deal with a lot of that in an automated manner, but we're talking about apps that have built up millions of users here, it is in no way unreasonable to expect at least one lowly paid human to look into these cases before shutting them down.  A single person could probably clear a hundred of these cases in a day, especially if the automated system gave them info on why it thinks the app should be banned - if it says there are too many negative reviews, that's real simple to check, if it catches a TOS violation, that's also real simple.<p>Here, it looks a lot like someone (maybe accidentally?) turned the sensitivity threshold too high on the ban-bot and never bothered to check if it was working right because it's not public facing enough.<p>As far as the Google comparison, to me that's rather unfair, because in the case of Google's app store, they <i>don't</i> tend to go around auto-banning large numbers of popular applications.

We aren't proud of 'giving up' but we stand by our convictions. Every situation is different and our decision came down to a multitude of factors.

Yes, the fragment is not normally transmitted to the server, but since the user is running code on their browser which was provided to them by mega, all mega needs to do is log the fragment back to their servers with a simple ajax call.<p>The point wasn&#x27;t that mega can deny ever getting the key - the point was that this &quot;security&quot; system in place is very obviously designed to workaround the problem of mega knowing what files they were trading.

10420338,comment,10420329,10420329,0,0,jancurn,,,"Hello HN! Today we’re launching what we were building for the past couple of months. Apifier is a hosted web crawler for developers that enables them to extract data from any website using a few simple lines of JavaScript. We built it because we realized that many existing web scrapers trade off their ability to scrape complex websites for the &quot;simplicity&quot; of their user interface. We thought: we are programmers and we already use JavaScript for client-side development, so why not use it for scraping?<p>Please have a look at the service, play with the examples and maybe set up your own crawl. My co-founder jakubbalada and myself will be around here to answer your questions. We&#x27;d love to hear what you guys think!",1445360333

I don&#x27;t miss trying to memorize all the key combinations from Emacs.  I like that Acme presents a clean, simple, and direct Unicode interface to what I work with: mostly editing shell scripts, and running shell commands, as a build engineer.  It takes a while to get used to mouse-button chording, but I don&#x27;t even think about it now.  I constantly use guide files, in many directories, to store and modify commonly used commands to highlight and run, so I make many fewer typos now, and don&#x27;t forget which commands to run or how I run them.  I can also switch contexts a lot faster, both because commands are laid out in the directories where I use them, and because the Dump and Load commands store and retrieve sets of files in the tiled editor subwindows.  When I had to work on Windows I enjoyed having a pared-down unixy userland that I could write scripts in, to use also in my Linux Inferno instance (mostly communicated from one instance to the other through a github repo for backup and version control).  The biggest drawback to me with Inferno is that so few other people run it, that I have to compile it myself on any new platform on which I run it (there are not really rpms/debs/etc available to just install it).  But your experience with Plan 9 Acme might be better, I just prefer also working with the Inferno OS improvements, such as bind, /env, sh, etc.",1445360332

I&#x27;m also working with the local Open Data/Open Government groups.  As I&#x27;ve gotten to know the communities I&#x27;ve seen this over and over...even in the Open Data groups.<p>I&#x27;ve come to the conclusion that it&#x27;s not malicious (or even &#x27;Not Invented Here&#x27; syndrome), but ignorance and a complete misunderstanding of the FOSS world. It seems that a lot of the people and groups involved come from a corporate background where they had to build and keep everything in house. Whenever I mention not reinventing the wheel, building on others work, collaborating with other groups, or opening up our the data I&#x27;m met with mostly blank stares. (I could go on and on about this disconnect and why I think it&#x27;s happening, but it&#x27;s not directly relevant to your comment.)<p>I think the major issue is that non-developers (and even some developers) have no idea how to work with others. It isn&#x27;t that they don&#x27;t want to or are refusing to, they fundamentally just don&#x27;t know how to. The idea of working with more than the fifteen people that are present in the room is mind-boggling, let alone the idea of working with people all around they world they may never meet. On top of that simple issue you have the same concerns you do with any person outside the Open* communities: security, trust, liability, etc. Have you ever seen a layperson look at a software/data license? It&#x27;s beyond overwhelming, so they all go back to whats safe, even if it&#x27;s not the right thing for their goals or the community as a whole.<p>To begin to remedy this I think we have a lot of work ahead of us...starting with making the ideas and principles of Openness more accessible to those outside our community.<p>TL;DR: I believe that silos are a symptom of being ignorant and/or overwhelmed by the Open-anything world.",1445360277

Pretty harsh, considering that the author of said &quot;ambiguous thesis&quot; is also one of the handful of people responsible for defining the very infrastructure which makes your diatribe possible to disseminate.<p>Actually no, TCP/IP/DNS is the backbone of the Internet and what made the Internet possible, HTTP was invented before Roy dropped his thesis. People like to give Roy kudos for inventing the Internet which re-inforces the &quot;Bible&quot; concept REST-afarins like to re-enforce as their blindly ignoring any other superior technology that&#x27;s not deeply rooted in a REST philosophy.<p>Here&#x27;s a quote from Alan Kay on the Internet as it was invented in 1969 - which handle billions of nodes that has never been stopped after it was turned on and had all its atoms replaced:<p>> The Internet was done so well that most people think of it as a natural resource like the Pacific Ocean, rather than something that was man-made. When was the last time a technology with a scale like that was so error-free?<p>Take note the lack of any mention of REST. This is what he has to say about the tacked on &quot;Web&quot; you&#x27;re attributing to the Internet:<p>> The Web, in comparison, is a joke. The Web was done by amateurs.<p>The thing that makes the Internet possible is its infrastructure, the thing that makes the web platform powerful is modern web browsers - i.e. the things that only the largest tech companies spending decades of developer effort and investing 100&#x27;s of millions can do to maintain a competitive browser. Which Despite its primary focus and decade-long head-start it&#x27;s still getting eaten by Native Mobile Apps and not because they better at adhering to the constraints of REST, quite contraire, they&#x27;re not grounded into the turn-by-turn per-request model and just focus on providing the best end-user experience they can using the most suitable technology for each task.<p>HTTP is a conduit sitting in the middle, adding unnecessary overhead on each request that&#x27;s great for linking documents and composing static content sites but is poorly optimized for Responsive or Interactive Web Apps.<p>>  you&#x27;d prefer whatever Facebook tells you is better?<p>No people should learn to think for themselves and use their experience to pick the best tool for the job, not blindly follow mindless preachers who can only think in REST ignoring anything superior that can deliver end-users a better experience - i.e. who Technology should be serving, not the other way round.",1445359957

The managers have new and extremely elaborate play acting to perform, dominance to new authority to vigorously enforce, and extensive new paperwork and reports and whiteboards to shuffle.  The snake oil salesmen obviously love selling snake oil.  The marketing and HR folk have a new feature nobody can deny they use because nobody knows what it is, its like being &quot;customer focused&quot; or &quot;empowered&quot;, it means nothing and sounds nice therefore everyone does it.  Customer svc has a great excuse, well, sure you have a bug, but now we have agile so surely there will never be any bugs in the future.  The customers are told things will get better because of Agile and when things invariably get better for whatever reason, it was because of the wise application of agile and their wisdom in selecting an agile supplier.

Nothing, really.<p>Everything that happens around a plastic christmas tree is really cool and fuzzy and happy and the best thing to ever happen and the nicest time of the year and watch us drinking cups of eggnog while you stand there as a plastic christmas tree.

But with some empathy for the point of view of the plastic christmas tree itself, all the foolishness related to christmas, is kinda irrelevant to itself in it&#x27;s tree-i-ness.

Previously tech companies, Microsoft being the prime example, paid employee&#x27;s a fair market wage but then gave options or restricted stock as well.  The rising stock price acted as a sort of bonus to employee&#x27;s.<p>With companies now spending more time private and getting more of their gains as private companies, what&#x27;s happening is that private equity and vc companies are now capturing more of those gains that the  public would.<p>Employee&#x27;s are also the one&#x27;s holding the bag here.  With their lockout periods after going public they are the most exposed to busted IPO&#x27;s.<p>One other worrying trend is that investment banks are no longer backstopping the IPO&#x27;s they shop.  If you remember the Facebook IPO, there was a lot of buying at the ipo price from the book runners to ensure that facebook didn&#x27;t drop below that price.  The last few tech ipo&#x27;s had no such support and happily &quot;broke&quot;, or traded below their initial offering price.",1445359685

In some cases, the companies agreed to give additional equity to investors if the IPO price wasn’t met.<p>This is not necessarily a &quot;sign of wariness.&quot; The investors are just doing what reasonably sophisticated investors do: protecting against downside risk. As long as the companies they&#x27;ve invested in can get out to market, the investors really can&#x27;t lose.

However...<p>The point I&#x27;m trying to make it that the cost is not the only part of the equation and that we must also account for reward <i>and</i> control.<p><i>Cost/reward</i>\nWhen the female birth control pill became available the cost/value was weighted very heavily against the woman and female control was much more essential.  However today the cost/value is more evenly weighted.  Back then a man could deny everything and move on leaving the woman with the baby and a ruined life.  Now the man can&#x27;t deny everything and as a minimum will be committed to child maintenance but he may still be denied access to the child.  So the situation now is: woman high cost coupled with high reward; man moderate cost and potential reward controlled by the woman.<p><i>Control</i>\nLet&#x27;s assume that both parties decide for themselves based on their own cost/reward situation. Let&#x27;s assume that they don&#x27;t always inform the other of the their decision honestly. Neither is perfect judge of character.<p>Current situation\n    Scenario 1: Man wants child. Woman does not. Woman controls outcome. No child.\n    Scenario 2: Man doesn&#x27;t want child. Woman does. Woman controls outcome. Child.\n    Scenario 3: Both want child. Child.\n    Scenario 4: Neither want child. No child.<p>Situation with male birth control\n    Scenario 1: Man wants child. Woman does not. Woman controls outcome. No child.\n    Scenario 2: Man doesn&#x27;t want child. Woman does. Man controls outcome. No child.\n    Scenario 3: Both want child. Child.\n    Scenario 4: Neither want child. No child.<p>P.S.\nPersonally I think that the pill was one of the greatest drivers of women starting to have rights on a par with men (I&#x27;m not saying that 2015s western world is perfect gender equality wise but it is a lot better than the 1950s western world was).<p>P.P.S.\nI just think that men should if possible have the option to control their reproductive function and that <i>it does not matter</i> whether woman trusts the man -- the man&#x27;s control does not affect the woman&#x27;s control (except in the scenario that the woman is a deceptive actor - NB that the inverse situation where the man is a deceptive actor is already under the woman&#x27;s control).",1445359455

Sometimes Agile is the least strongly defended possible victim.  Therefore Agile is bad.<p>Agile is complicated.  The simplest components to explain are also the most trivial.  Something that&#x27;s only trivial is invariably foolish.  Therefore Agile is bad.<p>&quot;Most people&quot; are experimenting with Agile.  Half of managers / devs are below median by definition.  Its a very realistic prediction that half the time, Agile will result in below median performance.  Therefore Agile is bad.<p>Every other silver bullet for the past 50+ years has been a scam.  Agile is a silver bullet.  No one can explain why this silver bullet is any more likely to be real than the last couple dozen fads.  Therefore Agile is bad.<p>Agile only seems to scale to a narrow range of team size.  Things that don&#x27;t scale up, or down, are stereotypically seen as bad by programmers, no matter if the stereotype is applicable or not to the situation under discussion (that&#x27;s why its called a stereotype or bias).  Therefore Agile is bad.<p>Sometimes Agile is implemented as a sub-scheme where the overarching style remains micromanagement or seagull management or simple chaos.  If the cake is a lie, a thin layer of Agile flavored frosting isn&#x27;t going to make the overall dish taste good.  Coverups are inherently bad.  Therefore Agile is bad.<p>Agile is impossible to define and really popular.  Grok that.  At least some of the bottom half of the median will simply use the word as a checkbox without ever implementing it.  Essentially managers who &quot;have no idea whats going on&quot; will sometimes describe themselves as Agile as false advertising.  Therefore Agile is bad.<p>Related to most of the above, the odds of finding a shop actually successfully implementing true Agile are low.  Therefore statistically if an employer says they&#x27;re agile that&#x27;s a sign for applicants to avoid them.  And that means the best people will successfully avoid agile, with all kinds of secondary effects.  Therefore Agile is bad.",1445358315

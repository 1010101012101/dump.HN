17518,comment,17439,17492,0,0,Tichy,,,"What do you think of them, though? I don't really like them, but perhaps it just takes some getting used to. Google and Yahoo are different, because I don't even now the words they are derived from. But the others - it's weird that those misspellings will probably become normal words if the startup is really successful. Perhaps they'll even replace the correctly spelled words.<p>Then again, if the exist strategy is getting bought by Google or Yahoo, perhaps the name doesn't matter much - it can be changed after the acquisition anyway (ie scripts.google.com).

News.<p>Hosted apps have a risk (coordinated failure) that desktop apps generally do not. 100,000 hard drives don't all crash at once. <p>Also remember that it's in the interests of journalists to assume a tone of authority, to write in a way that mimics reasoned analysis: ""this is part of a recent trend"".

3389524,comment,3388645,3389236,5,0,malandrew,,,"I spent two weeks traveling in Xinjiang in 2006 and everything I saw suggested that it was an occupied territory. The most obvious sign is that the population almost everywhere you traveled were ethnic Uighur, but the police forces were all ethnically Han Chinese. Prior to visiting Xinjiang, I had lived 1 year in Beijing and Handan, Hebei for 6 months. The other detail that caught me off guard is that for 1.5 years, I had not seen a police officer with a gun. Every police officer in the East of the country had a baton, but no gun. In Xinjiang, not only were the police of obviously different ethnic origin, it was not uncommon to see them armed with handguns and occasionally with an assault rifle.<p>I don't know anything really about the issue discussed in the article other than hearsay, but there is no doubt in my mind that Xinjiang is undergoing ""ethnic cleansing"" by dilution.

After my company rolled it out, I was shocked at how many of us took to it. Everyone knows the reason: it looks and feels like Facebook. When we encounter that look and feel, our minds go into ""sharing"" mode. We get comfortable because it feels like a comfort zone. We share documents, but we also joke around more. Our interpersonal relationships got better, and I'm sure that had a positive impact on our work.<p>I don't think Google+ will have an equivalent effect because few people visit it habitually, and when they do, most posts are fairly formal/professional instead of playful/casual.

3389476,comment,3389144,3389144,19,0,bane,,,"The problem is that the idea of visually representing information has caught on with the general masses -- and 90% of everything is crap.<p>It wasn't really all that long ago that terms like ""infovis"" or ""datavis"" were novel and new to the great majority of people. Sure everybody was familiar with standbys like bar charts and scatter charts, but the idea that you could cram complex multi-dimensional data into a single, novel, picture was relatively new as a discipline.<p>So now everybody and their aunt wants to ""visually represent information"" even if it doesn't make sense to do so, or the representations chosen artificially distort the information.<p>The problems are many but boil down to three essentials:<p>- the art department produces this stuff (""it's visual, so it must be the art department's job""). This is a department that is fundamentally wrong for producing representations of quantitative information. But I'm not sure giving it to the bean counters, statisticians, engineers or other nerdly disciplines is any more right.<p>- it's <i>hard</i> to come up with new and novel ways of representing information. Tufte's come up with approximately <i>one</i> - sparklines. And he's widely considered the king of the discipline. A couple others get bandied about ad-naseum,  Napoleon's March for example, and as a discipline it seems more geared towards taking apart other people's efforts at novel visualizations rather than producing new, good ones. Innovation in Infovis is rare.<p>- even when falling back on traditional techniques (bar charts everywhere!), they are open to abuse or misinterpretations depending on how the data is viewed. Have 1000 entries but only room for 10 in the graphic? Drop the other 990! Use logarithmic representations when linear would be better. Focus attention where you want with colors or other indicators. By choosing how the viewer gets access to the tables full of boring numbers, you can influence what you want them to see.<p>Infographics <i>can</i> be an entertaining way of educating the non-quantitatively minded reader without presenting tables full of boring figures. But I agree they are widely misused.",1324755146

Remember, freedom of speech is in place not to protect nice language, its there to protect the derogatory kind. We don't need rights to protect nice language. Think about it. So it follows then that technology developed under that platform of thinking doesn't always translate well to ones which have different customs, religions, and laws. Unfortunately, we can not assume or expect that free and expressive ways of thinking are acceptable in other parts of the world.<p>For instance, Fotoblur publishes a magazine in which an Iranian photographer was published. Unfortunately we couldn't send him a copy because American companies can not ship to Iran. We worked out a deal where we'd ship him the issues to a friend in Canada, then he would deliver them on a trip he was making to Iran. It worried me a bit because I found out that the possession of material containing nudity was a jail-able offense in Iran (that magazine issue had a few artistic nudes in it). Lesson learned: Our publication did not translate well within Iranian cultural laws.<p>The question for me is where is the line drawn when it comes to objectionable material. Most sites have TOSs that restrict such material that is considered objectionable or offensive anyway. I'd also imagine that this type of content constitutes less than 0.01% of the material and is being blown out of proportion and shouldn't even be part of the public debate.<p>Regardless, rather than having each nation determine its own laws governing Internet Services I propose a global consortium be developed.

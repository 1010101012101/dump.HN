The external disk will store my media and backup my local files already, so I don't want to have a backup of a backup.<p>This means I'd have to upgrade the disks of my external RAID-1 unit instead, but my old unit only supports 500GB disks officially.<p>Looks like it's going to be expensive.<p>For reference, I still had some IDE (EIDE?) harddrives manufactured in the 90's that spun up without a glitch a few years ago when I still had an old desktop box with the appropriate controllers.

3399132,comment,3398517,3398517,2,0,mhartl,,,"As long as potential customers aren't offended, this is an odd complaint, but the psychology is predictable. Indeed, part of the reason I made a free online version of the Rails Tutorial (the PDF book mentioned in the article) was to insulate myself against the criticism that I was gouging my customers. I figured that if people complained about the price of the PDF and screencasts, I could say ""Look, there's a 500-page book available for free online—what more do you want from me?"" This strategy has worked, with basically no complaints about cost. In fact, most feedback had been along the lines of ""This is a great value. I hope it's making a lot of money!"" It is, and finding a business model that makes money while giving away a lot of value has been very gratifying.<p>In the case of the Rails course mentioned in the OP, maybe they can record it and make the videos available for free, à la MIT OpenCourseWare. That wouldn't silence all the critics, but it might shut some of them up. And I bet it would boost sales to boot.",1325062514
3399131,story,,,5,0,lightyrs,"Amazon S3 Announces Object Expiration",,"Dear Amazon S3 Customer,<p>Today we're excited to announce Object Expiration, a new feature to help you efficiently manage data stored in Amazon S3. Object Expiration enables you to schedule the removal of objects after a defined time period.<p>You can define Object Expiration rules for a set of objects in your bucket. Each expiration rule allows you to specify a prefix and an expiration period in days. The prefix field (e.g. “logs/”) identifies the object(s) subject to the expiration rule, and the expiration period specifies the number of days from creation date (i.e. age) after which object(s) should be removed. You may create multiple expiration rules for different prefixes. After an Object Expiration rule is added, the rule is applied to objects with the matching prefix that already exist in the bucket as well as new objects added to the bucket. Once the objects are past their expiration date, they will be queued for deletion. You will not be charged for storage for objects on or after their expiration date. Amazon S3 doesn’t charge you for using Object Expiration. You can use Object Expiration rules on objects stored in both Standard and Reduced Redundancy storage. Using Object Expiration rules to schedule periodic removal of objects eliminates the need to build processes to identify objects for deletion and submit delete requests to Amazon S3.<p>You can start using Object Expiration today using the AWS Management Console or the Amazon S3 API.<p>To use Object Expiration from the AWS Management console:<p>Under the Amazon S3 tab, select the bucket on which you want to apply Object Expiration rules.\nSelect the “Properties” action on that bucket.\nSelect the “Lifecycle” Tab.\nUnder the “Lifecycle” tab, add an Object Expiration rule by specifying a prefix (e.g. “logs/”) that matches the object(s) you want to expire. Also specify the number of days from creation after which object(s) matching the prefix should be expired.\nYou can optionally specify a name for the rule for better organization.\nFor more information on using Object Expiration, please see the Object Expiration topic in the Amazon S3 Developer Guide.<p>Sincerely,\nThe Amazon S3 Team",1325062443

Yes, the pledge drive is annoying. But it only happens for a month or so a year, and it doesn't have all of the other problems associated with ads.<p>Other objections are that the advertisers would be the ones paying Wikipedia, and thus have the ultimate control; they can threaten to reduce advertising revenue in order to get objectionable material removed, they would incentivize people to put more advertising-friendly content that would draw people to lucrative pages and entice them to click on ads.<p>Ads are also a security and privacy risk. Advertisers who can inject content into pages can do varios nasty things. And advertisers tend to track what you do; tracking your Wikipedia browsing habits would likely be quite lucrative.<p>One of the worst things about the internet today is that so much of it is funded by advertising.

3399091,comment,3398780,3398995,37,0,bdonlan,,,"The article summarizes the report a bit badly. With most ADIRU inputs, each flight computer independently samples all three ADIRUs, and takes the median value. It also looks for outliers - if an ADIRU input falls far out of line with the others, the flight computer signals a fault, and disables that input. This can also be done manually.<p>What actually happened is one (of three) ADIRUs started mixing up its outputs - it intermittently labelled altitude data as angle-of-attack data. This happened after internal checks for data consistency, and before CRC generation - exactly how this occurred is a mystery, but it happened without the ADIRU detecting an internal fault.<p>Now, AOA data is measured by multiple independent sensors, and each ADIRU has its own sensor, on different sides of the plane. Because of this, under normal circumstances, AOA data can be somewhat different between the ADIRUs - much more so than the other inputs. Moreover, two sensors are on one side of the plane, and one on the other - making the median method weight one side far more than the other. As such, the flight computer software normally averages the AOA data from all three ADIRUs, but has an error checking system to detect and exclude erroneous data. This system detects when an outlier occurs, after which point it enters a 1.2-second cooldown, in which it uses last-known-good data. 1 second into the cooldown, it rechecks its inputs to see if the outlier remains (and if so kicks it out of the system), and at the 1.2 second mark it resumes normal operation. This error-checking algorithm is supposedly meant to deal with the situation where two ADIRUs are both temporarily bad due to some turbulence on one side of the plane - a fault scenario identified during early testing of the A330.<p>The key thing is, at that 1.2 second mark, it assumes any input that passed the 1-second-mark test is valid. In this event, ADIRU 1's AOA input spiked, triggering the 1.2-second cooldown. It then returned to a normal value for the 1-second-mark test, and then spiked again - at the 1.2 second mark, this invalid data was sampled, the average of all three ADIRUs taken, and a bogus value resulted. Once the spike resolved again, rate-of-change limiting prevented the value from returning to its true value immediately.<p>Note that there's also an independent flight computer monitoring system for each flight computer that only listens to <i>one</i> of the three ADIRUs, cross-checks the control <i>outputs</i>, and has the authority to disable the specific flight computer it's attached to if there is a discrepancy for too long (450ms). This flight control computer monitoring system <i>did</i> work properly, and disabled the flight computers in the end, switching over to manual pitch control via a more primitive, secondary flight control system. However, it took two faults (ie, pitch down events) to do so - one to take out each of the primary flight computers with pitch control authority.<p>In any case, a new error detection algorithm that avoids this issue is currently being distributed as a software update, and in the meantime there are safety bulletins instructing pilots to disable the affected ADIRU manually at the first sign of trouble.",1325060868

3399077,comment,3398780,3398889,5,0,bdonlan,,,"First, the black box doesn't actually do anything safety-critical. It's a pure data recorder, and only comes into play _after_ an accident. You're thinking more of the flight control computers, as well as the air data inertial reference units (ADIRUs).<p>These components are indeed redundant; from the sounds of the report, one of the ADIRUs malfunctioned (there are three), sending incorrect angle-of-attack data (as well as a lot of other incorrect data). Although the flight computers have monitoring routines for identifying and disregarding erroneous inputs, there was an unforeseen scenario in which a very specific pattern of erroneous AOA data could avoid detection - and this happened here.<p>It's important to note that the plane was not in autopilot at the time - the autopilot disengaged itself immediately upon detecting an input discrepancy (several seconds prior to the actual pitch down event that caused the injuries) and the captain took manual control. However, due to the fly-by-wire system, the flight controls are normally processed through a rather complex system that (under normal circumstances) helps prevent accidents due to human error (eg, it's impossible to stall an Airbus A330 under normal conditions; the plane will respond to your commands until just before it stalls, at which point it'll force a pitch down or thrust increase to maintain lift).<p>This invalid AOA data made the flight computers believe the plane was indeed in a dangerously steep climb, in danger of a stall (the stall warnings even sounded multiple times during the flight), and automatic protections called for a pitch down movement (ie, a descent). Due to the precise timing needed for the AOA fault to go unnoticed, some of the flight computers were unaffected - as such, shortly after each of the two pitch down events, flight computer error detection systems triggered failovers - but not until the flight computer currently in charge triggered a descent. The second time this happened, none of the primary computers were eligible for controlling pitch angle (due to each having a pitch-angle-related failure already) and so control passed to a more primitive backup system - incidentally disabling the pitch angle protections that had caused the problems, and allowing the crew to regain control.",1325060284

If I'm attacking an asteroid with a huge ass gun on it, I'd first like to have some type of EMP type weapon developed to simply shut down the tracking/aiming/power supply of the asteroid's defenses. Just the threat of an attack like that from orbit would probably be enough, as it would likely shut down life support on the rock as well.<p>Secondly, assuming that such a weapon isn't developed, depending on what you're mining, it seems likely enough that it won't matter what shape the asteroid is in. For mining solid materials, it would probably be best just to blow these asteroids into manageable pieces and send the whole lot through your enormous space processing plants for extraction and refinement.

Sure, 5000 degrees would be bad, but there apparently is no evidence that cooling drives matters.<p>I can't source the article, but seem to recall is was google related with the data coming from their experience with drives in their data centers.  It possibly could have come from BackBlaze, though that is a distant second.<p>I used to run a small ISP, and found that I had a 10% failure rate on average of anything, before it was even used.  Order 100 new servers, 10 will be dead on arrival.  Order 1000 drives, 100 will be DOA. 100 network cables, all will work, that was about the only deviation.<p>With drives, the failure rates were better, however, I never allowed drives to be put into use that were not internally ""certified"".  I would use SoftRAID, which is a Macintosh application, though I am sure there are equivalent on Linux and Windows.  While this is nothing more than software RAID for the Mac, many of my servers were not Macintosh.  I didn't use the RAID capacity of the software, rather using the drive certification feature instead.  It takes about 8 hours per 1TB drive to ""certify"" it. This will run through every sector on the drive, and make sure it is ok.  The softwares ability to ""predict"" that a drive was about to fail, or susceptible to failure, was very good.  I would never use a drive that didn't pass.<p>One handy feature which I did run on non servers with the software, is that it can monitor the drive and tell me that is suspects failure to be imminent. This is not SMART, though SMART was a first line test, the software went deeper and logged aspects of the drive over time.<p>Once I started doing this, drive failure went to near nothing.  I can't really measure failure in percentage or time, as we would outgrow the capacity of the drive, or the server would be taken out of commission for a faster server before a failure ever happened.  Those drives were then given to friends or sold.  As a result, we never had an in use failure once we started using this method of testing.  42U worth of server space, with a mix of 1U, 2U, 4U, and a few 6U NAS's, plus switching gear.<p>Do keep in mind, we were a small local ISP, and could take the time to perform these tests.  Someone like BackBlaze has their system created in a way to deal with failure as part of the operation, and it would be a waste of time to perform these tests.",1325059214

It's briefly painful for the person who has to find a new job,  but then the product is cheaper and better for everyone else.  Forever.<p>Jobs don't disappear.  They just change.  The industrial revolution made cheap many products that had previously been expensive or required armies of laborers to produce.  And then it made <i>available</i> many more that had previously been unthinkable.  A transition to a robot/information economy would have a similar effect; today's burger flipper is tomorrow's burger recipe artisan or perhaps robot maintainer/programmer, and can run a whole store by himself.

Safire died recently, and since then his column has been written by a series of guest authors.

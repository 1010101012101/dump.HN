That is great advice for any startup (due to the quality of the content), but for a startup selling to educators? Unmissable. In case you are unaware, patio11 is extremely popular on HN (for varied and valid reasons), and he runs a website which sells bingo cards to teachers.<p>) Agreed re: adverts - as a user, I would be annoyed that I am paying for your site and still seeing ads.<p>) Try outsourcing the creation of new material - the more subjects you cover, the better. There are many freelance where you can find teachers in various subjects, and your wife can act as ""quality control"".<p>) Use Adwords to bring more people to your site<p>) If you are specifically targeting Dutch schools, maybe creating a Hyves app will help? (Unless that is your employer :D )

Is failure okay or do you want to prioritize survival -- ""finishing up"" into a mature company?<p>We all know the startup model that Google has influenced and nurtured, and it's not about finishing up.  That's clear from the ""60% of the impossible"" quote.  To oversimplify, it's about ignoring revenue and giving away value in order to build huge amounts of usage.  I am not criticizing that, and it has a lot to recommend it.  But start-ups with that model are not going to finish up very often, just because they're risky.<p>So I'm a little confused.  Are start-ups failing because they're trying to do the ordinary, and instead they need to aim for the impossible?  Maybe this is the zen of Google.",1300467491

The team that put this together is the same team that launched chicago2011.org, an app that took 72 hours from conception to development to implementation.  I consider this a massive accomplishment, especially considering we were working with government.  Coming off of that success, we were pumped to push out potentially a real startup under similar time pressure.  You are now seeing some of the sloppiness that exists at the edges of a project like that, and I too shared your sentiment when usehipster went back into stealth/hype mode.  Using launchrock certainly doesn't help that since it is works really well as a vague hype machine.<p>I promise you that I will put more detail up to the public within 48 hours, and I would love to personally speak with you to explain exactly what we're doing.  You can email me at scottv@gmail.com if want, I would love to hear more of your feedback.",1300466616

2340937,comment,2340819,2340819,0,0,pauldisneyiv,,,"Nice.  I like the concept of ""best"" though it's obviously (purposefully?) vague.  What does best mean here?<p>An idea I like, is allowing eateries to accept reservations for specific tables.  After the visit the diner could review the actual table and rate its appropriateness for specific occasions (first date, business meal, group of guys, etc.)as well as a short writeup.  There are many places that have different vibes depending on where the table is, of course this can change on a nightly basis depending on crowd, day of the week, and other variables.<p>Adding this extra level of reservation personalization by allowing the user to choose their own table might encourage repeat visits.  Imagine if a couple had ""a table"" that they always liked to eat at.  It would also allow individuals to sort not by ""Best"" but by ""Best for Intimate Conversation"" or ""Best for Great Bay Views"".",1300466571
2340936,comment,2338368,2338368,0,0,iuguy,,,"It appears as though the data stolen <i>might</i> include RSA seeds. I thought I'd explain what this means for some of the people here not familiar with SecurID.<p>The seed is used a random key for the token and is used to generate a string of random numbers periodically to use. This is called a one-time pad as  you use the numbers in combination with a pass code (PIN) in order to log in. In theory you won't use the same code twice although in practice you can as long as the token number is valid (normally a few seconds).<p>So this provides you with two 'factors' for authentication - something you have (the token number) and something you know (the PIN).<p>If you know the seed for a token you can simulate a token [1](or put it on a real one) and use it. Where the token is being used in conjunction with a PIN (probably the majority of use cases) you'd need to know the PIN.<p>The PIN is between 4 and 8 alphanumeric characters in length, but most people use a 4 digit number (possibly as it's called a PIN and people associated it with bank numbers, I don't know).<p>Now imagine the scenario, you want to break into PG's VPN and he uses SecurID but you have his seed and you've synced up with his token, but you don't know his PIN. You can take a guess that it's a 4 digit PIN (as is common) and that means a maximum of 10,000 authentication attempts. Using a tool like IKECrack[2] you can brute force about 18,000 guesses with a P3-700, so it becomes quite easy to target an organisation that way.<p>Likewise you can start brute forcing two factor auth on Citrix servers as well to great extent.<p>The great thing about all this (from an attacker's perspective) is that people don't change their PINs. Why change one factor when the other is so infallible?<p>But what if you have a more complex PIN? Well, that 62^8 possible combinations for an 8 character alphanumeric PIN. Let's break this down:<p>62^8 == 2.18340106 × 10^14 combinations<p>62^8 / 18 000 = 1.21300059 × 10^10 seconds<p>62^8 / 18 000 / 60 = 202,166,764 minutes<p>62^8 / 18 000 / 60 / 60 = 3 369 446.07 hours<p>62^8 / 18 000 / 60 / 60 / 24 = 140,393 machine days<p>That's for a P3-700, modern computers will be considerably more powerful, although at some point the limitations of the machine at the other end kicks in.<p>Bottom line - 4 digit PIN and you're screwed. 8 character alphanumeric PIN and you're probably alright.<p>[1] - <a href=""http://seclists.org/bugtraq/2000/Dec/459"" rel=""nofollow"">http://seclists.org/bugtraq/2000/Dec/459</a>

One of the systemic problems in open source is that the last 10% is both no fun, and not well regarded in the community (this was a cultural challenge at Google as well when I was there)<p>In the start-up world you can think of those companies that had a good idea, but couldn't get themselves to finish it, as the primary food source for patent trolls. One need only look at patents assigned to your favorite 'non-practicing entity' vs for whom they were originally filed to see a long list of start ups the flamed out before achieving orbit.<p>This is also why there are only a limited number of deals available for 'untested' entrepreneurs, sort of the VC/Angel equivalent of 'frequent flyer seats'. Extra risk don't want to over weight the portfolio with them.<p>So perhaps a good way to start is to think about how you're going to finish and work backwards from there. If you define 'finish' as 'make a lot of money' and you're one of the principals in the start up, correlation suggests you are less likely to reach that goal.

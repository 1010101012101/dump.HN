4527443,comment,4527147,4527197,11,0,sschueller,,,"Switzerland uses the honor system in their public transit and it works.<p>There are random checks on small routes and long distance routes have a conductor checking tickets.<p>About 800 are caught each day with invalid tickets which is a very small percentage of total travelers. There are about 1 million travelers on rail per day. The fine is 'only' 100 CHF for the first offence which is very small if you compare it to ticket prices. However subsequent offences have higher fines and you are added to a database which you will stay in for at least 2 years.<p>About half a million out of almost 8 million residence have a year pass for the entire rail system (General-Abonnemente). Over 2 million have a year pass for half-price tickets (Halbtax-Abonnemente) so any ticket they buy is half price.<p>It is very nice to just walk in and out of trains, buses, boats without having to go through turnstiles etc.",1347746390

Our guys flew over to meet them at least two times. We (as a company) spent a lot of time on that financing round. We thought we would be able to close the deal, but something totally different happened. They stopped all communication with us. Suddenly. No explanations. No apologies. Nothing. We were in trouble.<p>Stuff like this is why I'm thankful for YC. Understanding the mechanics of raising a round has been <i>incredibly</i> helpful when evaluating what's actually going on. 2009 me would have thought two meetings with a VC was basically ""a deal"", 2012 me is much more capable of realistically evaluating progress towards a term sheet.",1347746327

4527414,comment,4526050,4526093,2,0,snogglethorpe,,,"> <i>Yes the Second Ave Subway is expensive, but how many cities are building new subway lines underground through incredibly dense existing infrastructure?</i><p>Tokyo for one.  E.g. the very recently built Fukutoshin line, deep tunneled subway underneath some of the busiest areas of the city (the tunneling is complicated in part because it had to dodge myriad existing subway lines), including very elaborate and expensive stations, had a cost-per-km about 1/4 that of the SAS.  The Fukutoshin line is also overbuilt in various ways because it will be interlined in the future with the Tokyu Toyoko line (an extremely high-ridership suburban line).<p>A number of recently built subway lines in the Tokyo area had many problems, and were considered extremely expensivebut they were still much cheaper than the SAS...<p>So it isn't ""complexity,"" it isn't ""density,"" and it isn't high wages (Japan is not a low-wage country!).  It's not faresTokyo transit fares are roughly on par with NYC; they're distance-based, so sometimes higher, sometimes lower, but it works out to roughly the same thing. Arguably it isn't even unionization, as Japanese industry is heavily unionized, although of course Japanese unions are rather different than U.S. unions.<p>One difference may be that Tokyo actually keeps building subway (and other rail) lines, and thus has has kept around the necessary in-house organization and knowledge for doing so, and has a wide selection of competent contractors available.  U.S. cities typically have none of these things, and end up relying on consultants (and may not even have the competence or freedom to choose the consultants well), and a limited selection of contractors.  [The NYC contracting situation is reportedly pretty dire, with a very few contractors having figured out how to game the system.]",1347745770

4527372,comment,4526621,4526621,16,0,bpatrianakos,,,"This is terrible advice and not something I think people should be recommending to others. I love Joel's posts enough to subscribe to the rss feed (which I have never done for any site ever) but this post is something I strongly disagree with for many good reasons.<p>The idea he puts forth is incredibly naive and has not been taken to its natural conclusion. He talks about the negative side of keeping up with the news while ignoring the many positives.<p>He puts forth a simple solution to a complex problem. The solution he comes up with is naive and extreme. The problem seems to be that news being biased and overwhelmingly negative puts a damper on your mood. It can also harm productivity when becoming too engrossed in it and when the news stirs up strong emotions. His point is valid but his solution is extreme.<p>I think it's this kind of attitude that is making Americans stupid when it comes to civics. People in this country (the US) have no clue what's going on in the world or domestically because they either don't follow the news at all or because all they can process at any given moment is some asinine sound bite that barely comes close to touching on the substance of an issue.<p>Following news isn't harming anyone's mental well being. <i>Not following the news</i> is what causes harm. We pay a price for ignorance and the bill is about due. Following the news keeps you informed, it expands your world beyond the narrow little bubble most people live in, and it makes you an informed citizen which then gives you the tools to make smart decisions and, if you're an entrepreneur especially, gives you insight into where your next opportunity may come from.<p>While Joel's points about the detrimental effect the news can have and the problems with the media itself are pretty valid, tuning out is the wrong solution. The real solution is to be aware that what you see and hear is often biased. Being aware of the business side of the news will make you a better, more informed consumer of news thus making any news you consume more valuable and often actionable.<p>Now, if watching the news and reading mainstream news outlets creates anxiety for you then you probably have to brush up on your skills as a consumer of news. You don't need to watch 8hours of CNN or read the newspaper cover to cover to be informed. Consuming mainstream news reasonably shouldnt be detrimental in any way to you.<p>Furthermore, the fact that he singles out ""mainstream"" news makes me worry. It implies that news sources outside of the mainstream are somehow better or more true. This is not the case. Many of these news sources outside the mainstream like the brag about how they are the only ones with the balls to report the ""truth"". Whenever anyone appoints themselves the authority on truth it's time to be skeptical. Everyone has an agenda and while mainstream news may have some major problems with bias and conflicts of interest, it doesn't mean they are completely without any credibility news outside the mainstream can be just as bad if not worse than mainstream news. These organizations often push a very biased agenda or peddle ridiculous conspiracy theories while claiming to be sources of truth. Many times both the conspiracy theories and extreme bias go together in a news outlet beyond the mainstream in an effort to push some agenda. I used to be a believer in ""truth"" and conspiracy theories (often being unable to tell the difference). Now I understand that truth is not always so clear cut. There are degrees of truth.<p>The best thing to do is not to ignore mainstream news but embrace it. Embrace it with a healthy amount of skepticism and logic. It will expose you to new ideas and keep you up on what's going on in the world. So long as you consume it smartly you won't have a problem.<p>This whole post seems to be born out of a non-problem. I mean it's a problem but a problem born out of going to extremes. I happen to be keeping up with the news and in particular the US presidential election. It sometimes makes me angry but not to the point of disrupting my life in any way at all. It doesn't keep me from being productive. I listen to the radio as I drive to the train and sometimes read a paper on the train itself. Thoughts of the news don't distract me at work or socially. And when I see or hear nonsense I can tell its nonsense and go on with my day.<p>This post is a recipe for ignorance. If you plan to live a monastic life or a certain lifestyle that allows you to get away with being uninformed then this is good advice. But for the vast majority of us living modern lives trying to get by in this world, it's a shortcut to happiness that has a price.",1347744621

4527367,comment,4523611,4526921,3,0,tikhonj,,,"For what it's worth, the reason I prefer Haskell is exactly what you're interested in--I want to make the ""best"" programs. The elegance of the language is just a proxy for this.<p>Out of all the languages I've tried--and I've tried a decent amount--Haskell is by far the most productive. I can write my programs faster and they come out shorter, more readable, more maintainable and easier to test. I've found it far easier to go back to old Haskell code I've written than old Java or JavaScript or Perl or even Python code. All this without significantly sacrificing performance.<p>I've also found Haskell far easier to refactor. In most languages, my projects' code size goes up monotonically; in Haskell, it isn't rare for me to both add a feature <i>and</i> make the code shorter! This was a surprise the first couple of times, but now I almost expect it.<p>Also, critically, I've found Haskell's advantages scale superlinearly with the complexity of the problem. That is, the harder a problem is conceptually, the bigger the advantage of using Haskell over another language. Haskell actually helps me <i>think</i> about the problem, even if I don't want to write a program for it. I've certainly found certain tasks far easier even in other languages by thinking in Haskell terms about things like nondeterminism.<p>This may seem counter-intuitive, but I've even found Haskell to be very good for prototyping. Once you get used to the slightly different style of thinking it requires, the type system actually starts helping you develop solutions quickly. I'm sure other languages may be better at this than Haskell, but Haskell really shines when it's time to take your prototype and transition to a solid piece of software--it makes the refactoring much easier and makes even significant architectural changes more approachable.<p>The real problem is that Haskell, for whatever reason, has the rather unfair reputation of being impractical. Really nothing could be further from the truth--yes, there is plenty of theory and research in the language, but this is not there just for fun: it actually makes the language better to use, even for more mundane tasks!<p>You definitely don't need to understand monads to make people happy, but it certainly helps. In practice, as PHP has shown :P, you really don't need to understand much of anything to do awesome stuff. And yet we all still heavily recommend encapsulation and testing and code reuse and so on; the Haskell philosophy is just a systematic extension of this.<p>I think Haskell's widely spread reputation as just an academic curiosity makes some people a little defensive--and well it should! But never take it personally. It's just a little annoying for an immensely practical and productive language to be cast aside simply because it derives its efficiency from a well-founded theoretical basis.",1347744372

Thiel himself at least had the fallback option of a traditional career in case his entrepreneurial aspirations didn't work out.

But there's one quote in particular that few intelligent people will disagree with, and that even fewer will be able to dispute.<p><pre><code>  There's no way to rule innocent men. The only power any \n  government has is the power to crack down on criminals. \n  Well, when there aren't enough criminals, one makes them. \n  One declares so many things to be a crime that it becomes \n  impossible for men to live without breaking laws. \n</code></pre>\nBy itself, speeding is a victimless crime: if you hit something or someone with your car, you were doing something wrong besides just speeding. The main idea behind speed limits is to ""make criminals,"" in Rand's words.  They are a tool that gives law enforcement a valid reason to pull over virtually anybody and everybody on the road.  At the end of the day, the result is less respect for traffic laws and police in general, but more revenue for police departments, municipalities, and insurance companies.<p>As a young driver, speed limits on open highways -- or simply the idea that an untrained, politically-appointed bureaucrat in Washington, DC has any insight into what's optimal for drivers on I-10 in West Texas -- were my very first encounter with the idea she's referring to.",1347743633

So existing iPhone users would have been happy. There was also no foreseeable external competitive pressure at the time, everyone knew that there weren't going to be any S4 phones for 6-9 months, and that Tegra 3 would be a joke.<p>They were also still on a 45nm process, and the A5 with dual-core A9s was already huge (120 mm^2). They would not have wanted to increase that at all, even if they had a working design of their own. What would have been the options? Seems like it would have been either reducing GPU resources, or dropping a core. Hard to see either of those being worth it.<p>Finally, one could argue that they main plan was their own core@32nm, and the A9@45nm was the fallback if there were process troubles. But these days there seems to be a strong preference to alternate new designs with new process nodes, rather than doing both at the same time. And in fact this conservative option is exactly the one Apple picked next spring: the iPad refreshes were a mix of 32nm parts (simple shrink) and 45 ones (higher clock, more GPU). If Apple weren't willing to risk going to 32nm even for a design iteration as conservative as A5 -> A5x (and the process was clearly working for them with the A5 shrink), the idea that they would have tried for a radical new design + new node 6 months earlier doesn't seem credible.",1347743498

They are designed because that is the safest speed to drive. They assume several things here:<p>1. Non-ideal conditions with many traffic lights require slower speed limits.<p>2. Views are often blocked by building, landscaping etc.<p>3. There are many types of traffic that do not conform to our ""car society"" but are still legal users of roads. (bicycles, pedestrians, etc.)<p>The 55 MPH speed limit was also not a matter of safety, but of energy savings. That's a whole different issue, however.<p>You can think what you want, but I can assure you that speed limits inside cities are not some sort of conspiracy. It's far more likely that most people feel they are better drivers with quicker reaction times than they actually have.<p>EDIT: Quick elaboration. There's a saying in architecture, ""You design a parking lot for a busy Saturday, not the day after Thanksgiving."" Speed limits are a compromise. You likely <i>can</i> go faster often (though like I said, most people are not nearly as good drivers as they think they are), but you must consider the times when you <i>cannot</i> go faster when designing the road (night, rush hour, rain, etc.). Speed limits are designed to find a good compromise. Remember, if this were a conspiracy, you don't have to be speeding to get a ticket, you can be pulled over for ""too fast for the conditions"".<p>The thing to remember is that speed limits are not set by politicians, they are set by engineers.",1347743306

I lived in a chronic apprehension lest I might, so to speak, miss the last bus, and so find myself stranded and benighted, in a desert of demodedness, while others, more nimble than myself, had already climbed on board, taken their tickets and set out toward those bright but, alas, ever receding goals of Modernity and Sophistication. Now, however, I have grown shameless, I have lost my fears. I can watch unmoved the departure of the last social-cultural busthe innumerable last buses, which are starting at every instant in all the worlds capitals. I make no effort to board them, and when the noise of each departure has died down, Thank goodness! is what I say to myself in the solitude. I find nowadays that I simply dont want to be up-to-date. I have lost all desire to see and do the things, the seeing and doing of which entitle a man to regard himself as superiorly knowing, sophisticated, unprovincial; I have lost all desire to frequent the places and people that a man simply must frequent, if he is not to be regarded as a poor creature hopelessly out of the swim. Be up-to-date! is the categorical imperative of those who scramble for the last bus. But it is an imperative whose cogency I refuse to admit. When it is a question of doing something which I regard as a duty I am as ready as anyone else to put up with discomfort. But being up-to-date and in the swim has ceased, so far as I am concerned, to be a duty. Why should I have my feelings outraged, why should I submit to being bored and disgusted for the sake of somebody elses categorical imperative? Why? There is no reason. So I simply avoid most of the manifestations of that so-called life which my contemporaries seem to be so unaccountably anxious to see; I keep out of range of the art they think is so vitally necessary to keep up with; I flee from those good times in the having of which they are prepared to spend so lavishly of their energy and cash.<p>From ""Silence is Golden"" by Aldous Huxley",1347743301

127261,comment,126540,126610,0,0,michaelneale,,,"Good question. I don't know - people tend to throw the ""racism"" term around when really its culture. India is made up of a bazillian races anyway, so clearly it can't technically be racism unless someone intends to slightly a significant percentage of the global gene pool in one hit (which is more comical, then anything).",1204447716

The value of ability to read tells is vastly inflated in the public consciousness.  Some bad players have very obvious ones, but at higher levels it just doesn't happen much that anybody picks up anybody else's tells.  You read other players by how they bet, not by which way they twitch.  Good poker players are good at picking out patterns by induction.",1204445721

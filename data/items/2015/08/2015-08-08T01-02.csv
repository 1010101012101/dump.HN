For instance, frozen vegetables are picked ripe, and packaged very close to harvest, whereas &quot;fresh&quot; vegetables are picked green, and spend weeks in a truck traveling across the country, and you end up eating them long after they were picked.  Frozen vegetables are better for you!",1438999153

10026045,comment,10023931,10024752,0,0,sdesol,,,"As someone who has developed a product that will let you search a Git repository, I can say there is a lot of moving parts.  And I can see why Bitbucket, GitHub, and others don&#x27;t support it.  Working at their scale does present a lot of challenges.<p>The biggest challenge is knowing what to consider and I solve this by enforcing a context for every search.  For example, if I know you are looking at 7 different branches, as the image below shows:<p><a href=""http://i.imgur.com/L7aHr2r.png"" rel=""nofollow"">http://i.imgur.com/L7aHr2r.png</a><p>I will only consider these branches when you do a search.<p><a href=""http://i.imgur.com/JYHgB6I.png"" rel=""nofollow"">http://i.imgur.com/JYHgB6I.png</a><p>Searching code presents a unique challenge since your code base is constantly changing.  And without the user giving you hints about what to consider, you&#x27;ll just end up generating a lot of noise.<p>Another example of how context simplifies things, is in the image below, I know you are looking at a tree<p><a href=""http://i.imgur.com/l8Y0oLA.png"" rel=""nofollow"">http://i.imgur.com/l8Y0oLA.png</a><p>so I will only search that tree<p><a href=""http://i.imgur.com/CIxHPjr.png"" rel=""nofollow"">http://i.imgur.com/CIxHPjr.png</a><p>When searching code, you really can&#x27;t guess what is important or not since what mattered in the morning may not in the evening. You really need the user to guide you and as you can see in my screenshots, I had to implement a new way of exploring Git.  The current way of browsing one repository at a time will not work in a lot of enterprise environments since a product is usually a combination of branches from different repositories from different time lines.",1438999024
10026044,comment,10025106,10025933,0,0,dmm,,,"Imagine that you decide to get a security camera system for some reason. Maybe you have a valuable collection of something or you have a small business with lots of easily moved/sold equipment. You can easy buy or assemble a DVR system with up to a few dozen cameras from a number of sources.<p>These systems can be very valuable in ways you may not expect. My parent&#x27;s recently captured video of a car accident in front of their house. This video greatly benefited a long-time neighbor and friend.<p>Anyway you get a system that has good video coverage of your building&#x27;s doors and windows and can record say a few days worth of video. You&#x27;re golden, right? Unfortunately you are vulnerable in a fundamental way. An intruder can find the video recorder box and destroy it. I personally know individuals this has happened to. So you come home from a long week and find your building broken into and the video lost. What can you do about this?<p>Simple... find a neighbor/AWS/colo box/etc and stream the video there too. It records a few TB of data and provides a backup in case of theft or destruction. This differs from typical backup situations of home users because of the bandwith involved.<p>Because ideally you would stream the video directly from the cams. If you have 10 cams producing 2 mbps, thats 20mbps. That&#x27;s a lot of upload for the typical home connection, but for a symmetrical gigabit connection it&#x27;s a drop in the bucket.<p>This is just one example. Having the bandwidth available makes so many things easy that were previously very difficult.",1438999000

10026041,comment,10024958,10025918,0,0,vacri,,,"> <i>and/or data destroyed right during an excitingly busy period</i><p>The idea that service providers destroy data when a cap is reached is just plain weird. Usually your access to the data is simply blocked - then you can pony up some more $$ if you want access to it.<p>Similarly, it&#x27;s also weird that people think Amazon doesn&#x27;t care about 4- and 5-figure accounts. They do. Big accounts bring in money... but so do a lot of small accounts... and there are a hell of a lot more small accounts than big accounts. At my last job our monthly bill was $1-2k, and I&#x27;d get regular contacts from the AWS account manager, along with free training days.<p>I think that the real reason is that AWS is generally not at capacity, and if someone does have a hostile overage event, it&#x27;s quite short term, and the only money that AWS really loses is from the wattage used by the VMs. There&#x27;s no extra labour or hardware on their side. Refunding overages is good PR and not all that expensive, as long as it doesn&#x27;t prevent other paying customers from accessing existing resources.",1438998957

10026036,comment,10025106,10025947,0,0,simoncion,,,">  I have a 50/50 fiber connection now and even with multiple people watching HD video streams, torrents and other files I don&#x27;t believe I come close to saturating it.<p>Unless you&#x27;ve throttled your torrents, or you&#x27;re connected to a really slow swarm, you have almost certainly saturated your download. I have -er- 100/10 or 100/15 service from Comcast. If I&#x27;m downloading anything >= 100MB, and a member of the household is going to start a new Netflix stream, I need to pause the download, or else the stream will be degraded for a <i>long</i> time.<p>Also, unless you&#x27;re using a decent router, it&#x27;s very possible that your router can&#x27;t route and/or NAT at 50mbit or faster. I know that Apple Airports can and Ubiquiti EdgeRouters[0] can. I would also expect that an ISP-provided router would route fast enough.<p>[0] If you&#x27;re in the market for a new router and are somewhat network savvy, or are comfortable with running OpenWRT on your router, I strongly recommend the Ubiquiti EdgeRouter Lite. It routes and firewalls at ~1Gbit/sec (when offloading is enabled) and costs right around $100. Check out the Newegg reviews that aren&#x27;t &quot;It&#x27;s slower than I expected&quot; or &quot;It&#x27;s totally broken&quot; for an idea of what you&#x27;ll be getting in to. I&#x27;ve had mine for nearly a year and -other than the eventually dodgy external power supply[1] it shipped with- it has been rock solid.<p>[1] The unit I got had been sitting in a box in a warehouse in Florida for ~two years before it arrived on my doorstep. The failing power supply presented as infrequent spontaneous reboots with nothing unusual in syslog, which became more and more frequent until the power supply just stopped providing power entirely. Replaced it with a wall wart that I had on hand and have had no trouble since.",1438998913

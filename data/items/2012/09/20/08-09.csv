Worked fine.<p>To get 9-10 hours I used a 9-cell pack and keep the brightness fairly low. The screen kills it more than anything. I also have a 128Gb Crucial M4 SSD in it which is a little less power hungry than most devices. It does only have 4Gb of RAM though.<p>As for usage, mainly Eclipse with JDT and a Windows 7 VM spun up for Visual Studio 2010. CPU is throttled most of the time and memory usage is about 60-70%. Disk IO is fairly low once everything is up. Unity is running in 2D mode or disabled entirely in favour of Awesome WM. I don't do heavy compile runs as a rule as our dependencies are quite small and coupling free.<p>Regarding charging, it spends most of its time docked in an Ultrabase but when away or sitting in the garden I rarely have to bother charging it. I've got to the point I don't actually bother dragging a mains charger with me. The 9 cell pack was a year old when purchased with the laptop off ebay - neither were new. The battery had 108 charge cycles when purchased. I have no idea what it has now as I don't know how to extract that info from Linux.<p>Battery life is better if you install Windows on it as a rule though. I actually much prefer windows on it to Linux but I'm forcing myself to use Linux as my primary OS for a few months to see how I get on.<p>Windows 8 will probably give best battery life as it is tickless as well but I can't stand metro.",1348131398

It's very nice for getting a quick view on file-based changes, why and when someone did them and I use that interface a lot for that. I find it way easier figuring out file changes there than in github. SF is generally a lot slower (sometimes so horrible slow that browsing is near impossible). GitHub on the other hand sometimes freezes my browser when it has a lot of syntax highlighting to do (not sure if it still does, been a few months since I last run into that).<p>They have different ways to present code with different design targets and different problems. I prefer GitHub for reading code online without having to check-out, I prefer SF when already working with a project where I have the code locally and using the online interface to hunt for changes.",1348131116

My iPhone is in WiFi nearly 100% of the time.  This means that the carrier's network almost never has to deliver data to my phone save text messages and, perhaps, notifications.  I'd be interesting to find out if it is actually smart enough to use WiFi for messages when available.  If it does, then nearly no data goes over the cellular network.  I suspect that lots of people fall into the same pattern.<p>So, carriers charge us for something that is underutilized and then, if we want to simply use the phone as a personal hot-spot we have to pay more!<p>Maybe I was right after all, in an odd sort of way.<p>Granted, not an Apple issue after all.<p>There's plenty more that could have been better with the iPhone 5.

If Google now just releases it free to users, isn't it a complete win for Apple? Contrast this to YouTube app, where Google still can make big money through ads in the free app. So, I think Google is not exactly thinking ""what's to lose?""",1348128644

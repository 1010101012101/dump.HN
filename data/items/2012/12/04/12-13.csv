4870669,comment,4867577,4870641,1,0,Wingman4l7,,,"Neat idea, but I don't think there were any onboard batteries -- AFAIK power was just fed straight from the RTG thermocouples, more or less.  Batteries would have just added weight, would have had a crappy recharge capacity after a while, and wouldn't have made much sense for a deep space probe which relied on an RTG instead of solar panels.<p>Also, the RTG might be powering instrument heaters, keeping them at warm enough temperatures to prevent failure.  If that's the case, once those are shut off, there's no turning those instruments back on.<p>EDIT: It appears that Voyager 1's  ultraviolet spectrometer instrument, at least, is pretty tough: as of January 2012, it has survived having its heater shut off for power conservation: <a href=""http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/voyager/voyager20120117.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/voyager/voyager20120117.ht...</a><p>That's one hardy spacecraft!  =)",1354625915

When one of my items (WiMAX router) didn't work correctly for the new buyer I offered to go round and help and give a full refund if I couldn't get it working (it started working thankfully).<p>The weird thing about gumtree was the rapidity of response - I put a microwave oven on there a midnight on a Saturday night, and got three email responses within 15 minutes.

This obviously means you can't <i>depend</i> on your garden. Also, what you would have would be a laboratory, not a garden. You would spend a lot more time analysing the food than eating it.<p>On the other hand, you could carry out a sample return mission, bring some mars dust back, run tests, and land with a solid plan.

All clicky-clicky?<p>Next day my wife saw that our booking disappeared. Wow, having calmed her down I checked all myself. Yep - no booking, disappeared w/o trace. The only things left - e-mail confirmations and less $1'000 on my bank account.<p>Next step - to send a message - several choices for the subject, one of them 'bookings'. No avail - since my booking was deleted, the system did not allow me to choose booking. Nice and cool - but my problem is booking...<p>Next step - call them [it is becoming urgent due to visa, etc] - found local AirBnB phone support number - dialed - nice greeting got cut after 30 secs and then silence and music...

Times and times again, it has been demonstrated that peer teaching is one of the most effective way to enhance learning.  In Physics, many profs (myself included) encourage students to discuss problems and help each other but without copying solutions. When you give one assignment every week with 5 to 10 problems to solve, and assignments count for 20% of the final grade, each problem is worth very little... which is why you do not penalize students strongly when you catch them for the first time copying a solution to a problem.  Learning the difference between explaining the solution of a problem (similar to explaining an algorithm) and just giving a solution to copy may is not something that is immediately obvious for some.",1354624487

When you buy a license, the licensing server associates some sort of ID with your installation, the same ID that must be presented to the server for an online play. No valid license -> no valid ID -> no online play. That's how all massive online games with free clients work. Easy-peasy. The question here is what can be used as an ID in case of iOS games, but, again, this is a solvable problem.<p>Moreover, the same scheme applies to the standalone software, except there's an extra step involved with strengthening the executable against any modifications. What Photoshop did is the lamest thing possible (and I think it's a valid theory that they did it on purpose to facilitate the piracy rather than to curtail it). A simple option is to sprinkle 100s of conditionals around the code (with a simple pre-processing script if need be), do not issue any sort of messages, but instead just make the code corrupt heap, stack and do other things that would cause the program to go down after a while. Then simply sign the executable. This is <i>very</i> effective. For every complain in the support forums that the program crashed (and a crash dump that shows the absence of a valid file signature), there's a automatic reply that it's a cracked copy, you get what you paid for.",1354624223

The issue in this particular case is not number of copies (pirated vs non-pirated) but the amount of hours spent from pirated vs non-pirated. Even that doesn't tell the whole story. Perhaps this game required a critical mass of users (some do)? If so, pirated users might ultimately be beneficial.<p>Also, when it comes to piracy there are a lot of people who download a lot of pirated content and then never look at it or they might try it once. Just getting the pirated content itself becomes a game;<p>3. How expensive is it to maintain a server on a per user or per user hour basis anyway? It seems quite likely a single machine can serve thousands if not tens of thousands of users as a conservative estimate; and<p>4. Are they shuttering the game or just overhauling the authentication model? If they plan on rereleasing it then the publicity of (1) becomes even more likely.<p>Like I said, I've seen a number of one-sided stories now where I've known something about the other side and as sympathetic as someone can make their case, believe me--generally speaking--there is a lot they don't tell you.<p>Also, don't discount the possibility of internal politics.

Links are discoverable even if you can't manage to make your URLs clean or even stable.<p>I think their bit on error codes is all wrong: Using an unfamiliar code number won't throw a human at all, as they come with a self-descriptive label like ""Gone"" or ""Conflict"", and should have a body with an explanation of what happened. (Which they recommend)  Error messages are for tools, libraries, and proxies; you should use whatever code gets you correct behavior from them (even if it makes no sense), but there's no value in carefully reducing the set of codes you use.<p>They have some slightly confused ideas about hierarchies, like suggesting version numbers always go at the root.  Surely version numbers should be at whatever level the API gets versioned? If you religiously put your versioning at the root, you're going to wind up with the standard API compatibility problem where someone wants to use a v3 feature so they (have to) upgrade all their calls to v3 and then get angry when there's some unrelated compatibility break.  Good advice on making it mandatory though.<p>For God's sake don't allow GET with &method=delete or the like.  You can narrow your verbs down to POST and GET but no further.<p>Insert mention of CSRF here.<p>The whole architecture section ""The API Faade Pattern"" is just a bunch of waterfall, API-first design nonsense. Don't invent an API in outer space then try to integrate it with a real system designed separately.<p>The whole point of decomposing your API into actions on resources is that you don't have to have one unified, consistent, holy API, each resource is an API unto itself that can live on its own and follow its own rules to get something done.

I think the sentiment of just declaring something (or, more often, someone) 'sucks' is a bit immature, and it's almost always unconstructive. I was listening to the Kalzumeus podcast the other day, and they were talking about this very thing on the last show they did. I can't remember what they called it, but it was something like 'Be curious' instead of 'be critical'. He had an acronym, but it didn't stick with me. Anyway, the long and short of it was, instead of saying something like ""this is just a pile of ass"", ask the question of why it might be the way it is - there are probably good reasons.<p>Actually, the Kalzumeus podcast is a good example. I don't especially like it that much (sorry guys, if you're reading), but as I sat in my car listening to it I tried to think it through constructively, rather than just declaring it sucky. I tried to answer questions like: 1) why don't I like it? (the smug attitude of 'gosh-aren't-we-just-coining-it-in-contractors', the ohmygodyes exclamations about everything, the poor sound quality) and, 2) could I do it better myself? (definitely not) and, 3) if it really is that bad, why am I still listening to it (and, of course, that's when I realized it's not actually that bad).<p>OK, some stuff genuinely is poor quality, and some people are fools, but maybe rather than berate them we would find it more constructive to ask the question ""why has nobody else done better?"", or ""why didn't they spend extra time polishing it?"", or ""why is this guy in this position and not somebody else?"". There are probably good answers to those questions. This is also moving in to 'constructive criticism' territory, which is actually good.<p>BTW, I'm not saying coddle me (or anybody else).

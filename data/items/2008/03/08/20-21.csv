132129,comment,131945,132069,0,0,crescendo,,,"I've always thought that the ""Back to the Future"" style of time travel would be a direct violation of the first law of thermodynamics.<p>Let's say that you invent a time machine and go back to time (t) in the past. Now, if someone at time (t - 1 hour) measured the entire energy in the universe and arrived at figure (e), when he measures again at time (t + 1 hour) the total energy in the universe will have increased by a factor of (<your mass at time of departure from present> * c^2). Energy will have been created.<p>I suppose you could look at it in terms of an equilibrium over all time--i.e. if you take eternity as a whole, the disappearance of your energy from the future would cancel out its appearance at time (t). But it would make these laws basically useless, I think, if you have to take into account any future or past events and how they might affect your current measurements.",1205009002

132122,comment,131942,132007,0,0,gruseom,,,"<i>Arrogance</i> comes from a root meaning ""demand"" (related to pre<i>rog</i>ative). <i>Confidence</i> comes from a root meaning ""trust"" (related to <i>fid</i>elity). So self-confidence has to do with trust in one's own ability to deal with a situation while arrogance has to do with demanding status or privilege from others. Based on this, it would seem that either of these qualities can exist without the other.<p><a href=""http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=arrogance"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=arrogance</a><p><a href=""http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=confidence"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=confidence</a>",1205008420

After Paul told me to stop, I did, then he took away my voting rights three days later. He didn't like my reply to his nasty email telling me to stop upvoting. My reply was ""Sometimes you take yourself too seriously."" Paul interpreted this as a ""Fuck you."" Which it really wasn't, though in the context of the email he sent me, I could see why anything other than ""Yes sir, I'm sorry"" could be interpreted as ""fuck you."" He has since ignored my attempts to apologize.",1205007971

132111,comment,132026,132054,0,0,Electro,,,"Go for instrumental music, it doesn't activate the part of your verbal part of your brain. Essentially to hear singing (or talking) your brain mimics it, however when you're trying to read/write you've got two processes and only one processor to put it through. You can struggle through, but not nearly as well as running them solo.<p>Also, just go onto TPB or usenet and download some Beethoven or Wagner. It's 100% legal, no copyrights exist on them and even if they did they're so old it'd be void anyway. Even the BBC offered them up for free at some point, they were surprisingly good quality too.<p>I learnt this a long time ago when I was working doing reviews. When you spend 10 hours writing reviews, you need something to listen to or you're going to start shooting kids and spearing dogs for making the slightest noise.",1205007184

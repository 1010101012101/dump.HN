26194,comment,25936,26181,0,0,aston,,,"Thanks for this. Sounds like you guys have some great reasons. Legacy's always a good answer, and productivity's a close second. I was mostly concerned with the web app frontend stuff with the ""really?"" tag. I didn't/don't really know your product well enough to know how much of it's in scripts and how much of it's officially part of the web app.",1180921130
26193,comment,25847,26130,0,0,BitGeek,,,"Really, its backwards.  Speed to market is a factor of team size-- the more engineers you hire the slower you are to get to market.  So, VC funding slows down the rate of feature development.<p>A small tightly focused and really motivated team will out compete a group of employees funded by VC everytime. <p>And, if you look at it from the perspective of the opportunity value-- you will get more massive going it alone than going with VCs.  Both because of the massive dilution of venture capital, and because of the significantly decreased chances of success.<p>Scaling should never be a problem-- you should outsource everyting but engineering and scalability should be the problem of your hosting provider. (or manufacturer, etc.)  At the time that you really need to scale you will have plenty of money to pay for it.  And because you outsourced this (something that is often harder to do in a VC backed business) you have people who are more capable working on it. <p>Course, I'm presuming we're talking about businesses that make something people want to pay for.<p>If you're building a youtube like business, then VC is the onyl way to go-- you're just gambling on some mebulous chance of profitability or getting acquired for having massive pageviews... and when gambling its always better to do so with someone elses money.<p>",1180920580

26190,comment,25847,26056,0,0,BitGeek,,,"If a term sheet isn't horrible, then the lawyer you're using is the one the VC firm hooked you up with!<p>Sounds like you believe you need to spend it all before you make anything.. I think you've got it backwards.  If someone wants to charge you $10k a month, find their competition and get the same service from them at a higher unit rate but paid for out of actual usage.  Negotiate.<p>""Not to mention the market might be radically different by the time you even launch.""<p>you're making an erronous assumption-- the VC treadmill has you betting the farm on the state of the market at some point in the future.  <p>Building a viable business means that you are <i>less</i> dependant on the state of the market, not more.  <p>One company I worked for was profitably doing consulting when we took VC funding.  They insisted that we close that business to ""focus"" on the product... the result was, when all was said and done th company ended up selling for less than the consultancy was worth and the founders got a fraction of it -- because the VC business took most of the money due to their preferences.   Venture Capital killed that business.  Now a decade later, the market that company was in is a huge multi-billion dollar market... if they'd kept the consulting business and kept at it for another three years-- they would have been in it when it finally did take off.<p>Bottom line-- you can't be frugal when taking venture capital.  Keeping a viable consultancy was percieved as a threat to the business-- even though it would have allowed us to hire more engineers on the commercial side.  ITs almost as if VCs want you completely dependant on further funding from them.  (Or they are just totaly incompetant at business.)<p>\n",1180920236
26189,comment,25847,25847,0,0,BitGeek,,,"Unless your product requires you to build a factory (and even if you're in the manufacturing business its highly unlikely that you can't profitably outsource even manufacturing) -- then you absolutely shouldn't take VC funding. <p>YC, Angel, Friends and Family, maybe even a couple million (to last several years)... but not VC funding. <p>VC funding is for people who would like to spend four years working like a dog for a %1 chance to get $10M in payoff...than the alternative of four years working like a dog for a %400 chance of getting a $1 million payoff. <p>The value of these two opprotunities are $100k for the VC route and $4M for the independant route. <p>But, like contestants on ""Deal or no Deal"" they don't do math and they go for the big score instead of the sure thing.   You only hear about the people who get the big score- they go to conferences and they start investment funds.  but for each of them there are 100 or mor equally talented people who went the VC route and are now employees somewhere because the VC killed their company.<p>The big difference is when you get on the VC treadmill, as pointed out, the only options viable to the VC is IPO and acquisition... and you'll be diluted all to hell.  Worse, you'll hire too many people spend too much money and lower your chances of success.... because you're spending that money before you know it works.  And you pay in equity for the priviledge of lowering your chances.<p>On the other hand, if you angel fund, you can quickly determine whether the business is viable, and if it isn't, you only spend a few months on it before trying another idea.  In four years you should be able to try 16 businesses .... but likely you'll make $1M per year doing it.   And at the end of it, if you've failed and you've got a business that's throwing off $400,000 in cash for you for profit (your share) you could stop working and live on that  $400k.  The 99 out of 100 times that your VC backed venture fails, you've got nothing to show for it.   So, even if you ""Fail"" and have a business worth $4-$8M, you still win.<p>One of the commentators had an excellent and underrated point:\n""And thats the rub. Every lawyer, finance, and admin guy you run into at a VC firm will think they know your idea better than you, and worse yet, better than your intended customer.<p>Sure, they will give you funding, but along with that funding comes their screwed up way of thinking that no matter how much you, because they have money, or an mba, or a bar number, that qualifies them to tell you how much more they know than you.""<p>Never met anyone associated with a VC (including Seqoia) who wasn't dumb money but thought they were smart money. (except Guy Kawasaki, who is smart enough to realize he's dumb. If you think you're smart, you  aren't, if you think you're dumb, you're smart.) <p>",1180919870

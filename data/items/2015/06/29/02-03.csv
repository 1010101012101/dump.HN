It will be half or a third of the cost.  Get something laser cut/SLAd/vacuum molded etc and it just doesn&#x27;t compare.  There is a larger supply of suppliers hence more competitive prices.  Just go on alibaba and order a sheet of aluminum and do the same from virtually anyone in the US.  Energy is important but many of these materials and parts aren&#x27;t originating from the US hence you are paying to ship all the parts, then assemble in the US and then ship to the customer.  Instead the factories in China buy in mass from local suppliers and ship the end product once.  The cost structure just ends up being superior.  There are a lot of scraps also.  Not shipping those as a result of shipping final products is huge as well.",1435546471

Nothing.<p>I think those barriers that come between founders and MVP are important obstacles to learn to overcome. IF you can&#x27;t get an MVP off the ground, with all the distractions like incorporating, how the heck do you hope to survive the real challenges of a startup like figuring out how to make payroll when there is no money in the bank.<p>Maybe i&#x27;m wrong, but something about removing these barriers strikes me as self-defeating, and would likely lead you on a journey with lots of folks who never should be doing startups in the first place.<p>It&#x27;s not like the barrier to entry is so big right now...but your belief that &quot;nothing should come between a founder and an MVP&quot; is fundamentally flawed.

Add new patient.\nFill in many many different check boxes/drop down lists about the patient. Some of these seem irrelevant.\nPush a button.\nTreatment recommendations come up. Top recommendation is reasonable.\nEvidence summary provided about the recommendation. This is explicitly marked as being human curated from the MD Anderson, not generated by Watson.\nLinks to possible clinical trials given - these were wrong, not applicable to the patient at all.<p>So in summary, this is really designed for a doctor treating a cancer that they aren&#x27;t really used to treating. There is no &#x27;magic&#x27; that I could see. Maybe I used the most simplistic version, but the major limitation seems to be that it requires very structured input about the patient&#x27;s case. I can&#x27;t indicate for example that there was something unusual about the how the cancer looked under the microscope, or that the patient has a rare other medical condition that influences the treatment decision etc. Not surprising, because these are factors that lack an evidence based recommendation. If you read the article this is the key point:<p>&quot;I see technology like this as a way to really break free from our current health-care system, which is very much limited by the community providers. If you want expert care you have to go to an expert center,&quot; she said, &quot;but there are never enough of those to go around.&quot;<p>This is quite a different goal to &#x27;revolutionising&#x27; cancer care, or &#x27;taking on&#x27; cancer.\nThere is clearly a lot of hype...

What is good is when markets operate properly and resources (including human resources) are allocated in the most efficient way.

It&#x27;s been on my mind and I&#x27;ve been gradually taking steps to evolve the website into something usable for that purpose, but, for now, I have a firm priority list of things which need to get done that users don&#x27;t care much about. YouTube TOS concerns (nothing huge, I&#x27;ve worked through them with YouTube I just need to finish writing the code), some security/oauth concerns, and getting SoundCloud added as an additional catalog source. Once those things are done I&#x27;d expect a lot of the &#x27;smaller&#x27; features to get implemented very quickly.<p>You can see a full list of feature requests here: <a href=""https://github.com/MeoMix/StreamusChromeExtension/issues"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/MeoMix/StreamusChromeExtension/issues</a>. I haven&#x27;t embellished on all of the ideas yet, but the list should give you a general idea of what I think needs to happen -- including improving the UX of sharing playlists.",1435543596

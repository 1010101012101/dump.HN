You are making the assumption that an increase in minimum wage does not decrease the employment rate.<p>Your particular country may be benefiting from a commodities export boom, free-money level interest rates, or any number of other internal or external factors, which allow employers to get by fine with raising the minimum wage. Perhaps they had huge margins already, the customers can eat the increase in cost, CEOs are enjoying a stock market boom and don't dare to let their companies growth stall, whatever.<p>In an economic contraction things aren't so rosy.<p>We have a unique situation now where minimum-wage level employees are increasingly competing with machines.

5335981,comment,5335774,5335774,1,0,ggchappell,,,"Nice little post. But I see a few problems. techgeeknet, is this code your work? Regardless, here is a critique.<p>(1) The biggest problem is doing a ""free"" on a caller-provided pointer without giving any explicit requirements for where that pointer originated. It definitely needs to be stated up front that the nodes in the list referenced by list2 must have been individually allocated with ""malloc"".<p>Alternatively, the removed nodes could be returned to the caller in a separate list, which the caller could then deallocate.<p>(2) A somewhat similar issue is that the two input lists must have no nodes in common. Again, this needs to be stated.<p>(3) Variable names. I see ""list1"", ""list2"", ""list"", ""tlist"", and ""dflag"". What do these mean? I'm not sure. (OTOH ""mergedlist"" is good; that should be kept.)<p>(4) Efficiency. As noted at the bottom, this is a quadratic-time algorithm. True, it does make minimal assumptions about the type of ""info"". But with slightly stronger assumptions, the code could be a lot faster.<p>In particular, if the type of ""info"" is orderable, then do a Merge Sort on each of the input lists first. The resulting lists can be merged in linear time. So the whole algorithm would be log-linear time. And there would be no significant additional space requirements (if a non-recursive Merge Sort is used).<p>If the type can be hashed, then deplicates can be detected by inserting all values into a Hash Table. The resulting algorithm is still quadratic time, and it does require space for the Hash Table, but the average case is much faster: linear time.",1362628594

While the other allows you to add features from different libraries as you realize you need them, sometimes that leads to less constancy in the code base. But with good conventions and design you can build and app with Backbone/etc. that is just as maintainable and scalable as ExtJS or Dojo.

He disagrees with this position, that the president has this constitutional right. He wants the administration to state clearly that they do not have this right.  He mentions the Posse Comitatus Act over and over which prohibits the military from using force on American soil unless war or an insurrection is declared.  If the military cannot operate within the boundaries of the the US (except for imminent threats), then these issues are police matters. There is a legal process for this.  Paul describes the clear distinctions that separate military and police power from judicial power.  Clearly and unequivocally, the precedent needs to be stated and defined. I think, and from what I gather, Paul has stated that this is obvious and not very complicated and can easily be stated. But for some reason the message keeps getting muddled by the administration, and we get the repeated ""no intention to"" answer over and over...when the dispute comes down to ""have no constitutional right to"".

It may be true that _some_ of the claims used to support a $12 wage would apply to a $1,000 wage. Surely you won't take the position that this is true of _all_ possible claims.<p>The following claims I post are examples of counter-claims. I haven't thought these positions through entirely, but they refute the reductio ad absurdum argument that $1,000/hour is as reasonable as $12/hour:<p>* I make a claim that most minimum wage jobs produce more than $9/hour of productivity to their employer. Assuming this is the case, we can raise the minimum wage to $9/hour without severely impacting the number of jobs currently available. This claim becomes less true the higher the minimum wage goes, and I certainly wouldn't support it at $1,000/hour.<p>* I make a claim that the job-losses caused by raising the minimum wage to $9/hour are offset by the job-gains caused by people scaling back from 2 jobs to 1 job). This is certainly not possible at $1,000/hour.<p>I think your reductio ad absurdum in this case is indeed absurd, unless you are using it to invalidate _specific_ claims (i.e. refuting the increase MPC claim)",1362626187

5335792,comment,5335627,5335627,2,0,hardwaresofton,,,"I think you should avoid ExtJS. I believe you should avoid it because it's considerably heavier, hard to look at, and most importantly, there are some other people where I work that use it, and I don't envy them at all.<p>I feel that their development is held back in large part by difficulty understanding ExtJS, and difficulty finding documentation for a lot of things. Don't get me wrong, ExtJS has a very extensive man pages, but a lot of it is just descriptions (sometimes incomplete) of classes and methods -- where as when I last checked, the official guide was lacking.<p>I'm about 90% sure that ExtJS can dynamically load modules. It really depends on what kind of performance you are looking for for your app. There are some benchmarks out there, this one should help:\n<a href=""http://jsperf.com/angular-vs-knockout-vs-extjs-vs-backbone"" rel=""nofollow"">http://jsperf.com/angular-vs-knockout-vs-extjs-vs-backbone</a><p>Like acesubido said however, Sencha is a resource that the devs are free to tap into and get support from if they buy a Sencha contract. This will be extremely important if you feel the team will have trouble adapting.<p>However, my general opinion (as stated above) is that ExtJS is more trouble than it is worth. From what I have seen, my colleagues spent more time making ExtJS components and trying to figure out what went where than building useful functionality. Also, from what I have seen (though this may be specific to my witnessed case) - choosing ExtJS means basically moving away from markup, in general. When looking through the code base of my colleagues (I had to help them debug their app alot), there was a metric ton of JS, but almost no HTML. ExtJS, though very powerful, abstracts almost too much from markup, and gets very heavy very quick.<p>If you're wanting them to learn HTML5 as they go, or even any HTML at all, they're gonna want to at least get a chance of writing it.<p>Please take all this with a grain of salt, I'm very biased against ExtJS because of how much trouble I've had with it -- as a confident developer I'd choose Backbone/Ember/Angular... If I wanted the safety net, I'd choose ExtJS",1362625640

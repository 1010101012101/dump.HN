Free speech is such a principle.<p>Principals are compromised by compromise.  Preferences are not. Therefore if you think in terms or the right to freedom of speech, compromise is how you lose.

The Pirate Bay doesn't <i>host</i> any of the files and it's up to the producer of the media to give the consumer a better experience. They aren't doing that, what with the DRM on CDs, DVDs, etc. Don't forget the movie previews or other ads that are included before a movie begins. You also aren't given the option of purchasing <i>just</i> the movie as opposed to the movie + interviews + whatever.<p>The producers and distributors could be doing a much better job but they aren't, and the consumers don't like it which is why they resort to piracy (of course a lot of them probably do it because it's free).",1240109519

NYSEC does a ""second Tuesday of the month"" thing; there's more security people in NYC, but our attendance is often 2x theirs. What we do instead is a mailing list and a website, and we poll the group members about what the best date is. 8 months in, we switched from Thursdays to Wednesdays, for instance, and got a significant boost in attendance.<p>* We publicize. Why wouldn't we? Sure, you want good people there, but the idea that there even is a ""group filter"" is a deterrant to newcomers. And what's more important than a group filter is attendance.<p>I actually <i>don't</i> think showing up and meeting only two people makes it a good experience for a newcomer; I think it ensures that newcomer isn't coming back next time. Better to skip a month or two than risk new people having that experience.",1240106519

As the article delved into, a lot of these people are big followers of &quot;alternative medicine&quot;, which is a field chock full of con artists and shysters claiming to be &quot;experts&quot;.  If someone is gullible, then they&#x27;re easily convinced by these fraudsters that their &quot;treatments&quot; are real and work, even though it&#x27;s just the placebo effect.<p>I&#x27;m just like the article&#x27;s author: I was married to someone like this.  My advice if you find yourself in a relationship with someone big into anti-vax or alternative medicine: GET OUT.  If you have a logical worldview that isn&#x27;t full of conspiracy theories, and you believe in things supported by real evidence, and your partner doesn&#x27;t, then the disagreements over this stuff are going to tear your relationship apart.

This compiler goes beyond normal &quot;minimzation&quot; and goes into dead code removal, function inlining and a ton of other stuff. That compiler is written in Java. So it&#x27;s highly unlikely that JVM is removed as a dev-time requirement anytime in the near future.<p>On the other hand, I have never really seen a need to remove it. Once the CLJS compiler is up and running, incremental compilations on huge codebases (~300 files) takes a fraction of a second.

Tie the results to the payout and the expected value should show that working at a start up with the idea of making money via equity is foolish compared to Big Co. Let&#x27;s take that 1% one and say you get $500k if it works out in an IPO. And let&#x27;s say you take a salary below market of $30k. It will take the start up 7 to 10 years to IPO. You gave up maybe $300k for the chance at $500k. Or the 5% case where the company exits early and everyone gets $100k. Maybe that takes 3 years. You gave up perhaps $90k for a chance at $100k. You can play start up lottery several times in your career, but equity, unless you are getting a very significant portion, should not be a large factor in choosing the start up you work for.

Thus, there is an emotional component in the initial premise that, when confronted with facts and reason, lead them to dig their heels into the sand and hold the line instead of thinking logically.<p>4) There&#x27;s an industry supporting anti-vaxxers — and we&#x27;re driving them into its arms\nTL;DR: There are people positioned to exploit fear, and it is these people who are validating the anti-vaccination movement, despite various ethical concerns, and allowing it to thrive.  Without these people, the movement would have died out shortly after it had started.  Also, anti-vaxxers seeks support from loved ones and people who have experience with the subject matter to validate their worldview.<p>5) Changing someone&#x27;s mind doesn&#x27;t just take love. It takes empathy.\nTL;DR: Anti-vaxxers come to their erroneous conclusion about vaccinations after bad experiences, not logic.  The road to change minds is through empathy, not attack.<p>He makes an interesting quote in his article: &quot;The anti-vax position was not a deal breaker for me, but suggesting that we should expose her daughter to grave dangers for no good reason was a deal breaker for my wife.&quot;  This reasoning could (and arguably should) be applied in reverse: suggesting that we should expose children to easily preventable dangers (various potentially lethal childhood illnesses) for no good reason should be a deal breaker in any kind of relationship.  While empathy could change an anti-vaxxer&#x27;s mind, the dangers of having children unvaccinated while this strategy is employed is too risky, so a more direct approach, in my mind, must be taken.  It&#x27;s like trusting someone to drive you to the store while they&#x27;re very drunk when it&#x27;s better to never get into the car and to stop them from driving, if possible.<p>Likewise, he compares the anti-vaxxer movement to arachnophobia.  His conclusion to drop his stance on vaccination doesn&#x27;t logically follow from this comparison, however, as arachnophobia is a mental illness, treated by certified therapists when the phobia starts preventing people from living their lives or driving people to impact other people&#x27;s lives. The logical conclusion to this comparison is to treat the anti-vaccination movement as a mental illness, encourage anti-vaxxers to seek out certified therapists, and enact laws to prevent people who don&#x27;t vaccinate their children or themselves from spreading easily preventable but potentially life and quality of life threatening diseases.",1450975799

Removable firmware part used to happen in older machines, too.<p><i>Far as I know</i>, I came up with it first with a proposal on Schneier&#x27;s blog, etc to put both the CPU and trusted state on a stick or card you inserted into a machine containing only peripherals maybe with RAM. Research CPU&#x27;s at the time had RAM encryption/integrity to make it untrusted. I was thinking PC Card rather than stick due to EMSEC, storage, and cost issues. I&#x27;ll try to find the link later today.<p>It was actually inspired by foreign, airport security compromising stuff. People asked me to develop a convenient solution. So, real problem was physical access to the trusted components. That access couldn&#x27;t happen but can&#x27;t keep all our gear with us or away from inspection. A simple chip or PC Card they carried on would be better. The chassis, from laptop to whatever, they could acquire in country or ship separately with inspection. I further imagined a whole market popping up supplying both secure sticks/cards and the stuff you plug them into. Inspiration for that was iPod & its accessories like docks. One more part was that each user could determine how much protection, from tamper-evidence to EMSEC, to apply to their trusted device.<p>As it sometimes happens, another company showed up with government backing IIRC and R&D on security devices. Their proposed portfolio was very similar. They undoubtedly started patenting all of it. This created a second risk for anyone attempting what I or now Joanna is attempting: a greedy, defence-connected, third party legally controlling pieces of your core business. They usually just rob people but I predicted on Schneier&#x27;s blog & later here in a heated debate that they could attempt to change or get rid of the product using their patents. Especially true if a proxy for an intelligence agency. We might have just seen that happen with Apple over iMessage but I can&#x27;t be sure. Anyway, do know there&#x27;s both prior art and probably patents on these concepts in defense industry.<p>So, it was a cool concept. It was one of those I was proudest of given it collapsed problems with all kinds of devices to design and protection of one component. That&#x27;s basic Orange Book-era thinking I try to remember. Unfortunately, after much debate with marketing types, we determined there was a chicken and the egg problem with these [at the time]. The NRE cost would be high to the point you&#x27;d want to be sure there was a demand for thousands of them plus people willing to pay high unit prices. Custom laptops were often closer to $10,000 than $3,000 if low volume. My greater market idea was chicken-and-the-egg times a million. That plus risk of 3rd party patents made me back off the idea as nice but not practical.<p>Since then, what&#x27;s changed is dramatically lower cost for homebrew hardware or industrial prototyping. Projects like Novena show it can probably be done for lower NRE than before. However, this is security-critical design that needs strong expertise in both hardware (esp analog/RF) and Intel x86. That will up the NRE and odds of them screwing up. ARM or MIPS (&quot;cheaper ARM&quot;) might be easier to do but still need HW expert and significant NRE.<p>So, there&#x27;s my take. It&#x27;s a good idea that two of us in security industry already fleshed-out with removable firmware being proven in ancient mainframes. Serious marketing obstacles to getting this done and done securely. A high-level design for the technology, as I did, is pretty straight-forward and will teach one many lessons. It was a good learning experience if nothing else.",1450974366

He defined a problem space (implement a game like in the 90&#x27;s with a software renderer) and decided to use the common parts of C and C++ for the actual implementation.</i><p>Well, I would ;-). I think the quality of the code he writes for the game scores low on almost any objective measure of quality except pragmatism.<p>>> <i>You made me curious, what do you consider a good programming style for game programming ?</i><p>I don&#x27;t think there is a single &#x27;good programming style&#x27; for games, it all depends on the game, the development environment (language, tools) the third-party components you use, the target platform, etc. I think there&#x27;s a lot of best practices you could apply to any game though. Applying abstraction in those parts where it matters and doesn&#x27;t negatively impact performance, for example. Defining the components of your game and keeping clear boundaries between them. Making good use of the language features at your disposal. Not obsessing over constant factor performance &#x27;optimisations&#x27; before you know where the bottlenecks are. Thinking about and preferring efficient algorithms and data structures, over quick & dirty &#x27;handmade&#x27; data structures, just because you feel STL or boost are &#x27;not efficient&#x27; (it doesn&#x27;t matter for 99% of your game code, especially not for something simple as HH). Not passing around naked pointers everywhere.  I could go on for a while...<p>If you watch Casey work on HH, most of the time he&#x27;s fiddling with and rewriting the same things over and over again, because he feels that he always needs to program everything &#x27;in the simplest possible way&#x27; first, and then rewrite when necessary. I don&#x27;t disagree with throwaway code at all, and not everything always needs to be &#x27;designed upfront&#x27;, but he&#x27;s taking these things to the extreme, which results in an entangled mess of spaghetti code full of bugs (which you&#x27;ll have seen he runs into in almost every episode of his stream). He basically disregards all the advances we&#x27;ve had in programming since the 90&#x27;s, and keeps hammering in C-style code that happens to be compiled by a C++ compiler, but doesn&#x27;t use any of the advantages C++ provides.<p>I still like to watch him do it though because there&#x27;s definitely educational value to his videos, and he does solve some interesting problems along the way. And because I&#x27;ve been working on a simple game myself for a while. In my earlier comment I refrained from plugging my own little side-project but now you&#x27;ve asked you could take a look here [1] if you wanted to see how I like to program games. It&#x27;s about an equal amount of hours in as HH but it already has some actual gameplay, is fully scriptable using Lua, Box2D physics, a sprite-based OpenGL rendering backend, persistency (freeze/unfreeze), action replays with live code updates (inspired by HH, but done &#x27;the right way&#x27;), texture-mapped truetype font rendering, some interesting &#x27;handmade&#x27; algorithms (complex polygon triangulation, sprite packing), motion controls, etc. I realise it&#x27;s not the same thing as HH as I prefer not to re-invent the wheel for everything and use libraries and frameworks, but I still feel it&#x27;s much closer to how you would program a &#x27;real&#x27; game using modern technologies.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.wouterbijlsma.nl/blog/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.wouterbijlsma.nl/blog/</a>",1450973899

Sure, there&#x27;s an optimal strategy, but because of the resource discard rules on rolled 7s (the most common roll, of course), you very often have to make the purchase that you can.  It&#x27;s either that or not make a purchase at all and lose out to the discard.<p>&quot;Playing to luck&quot; is different than &quot;playing to the board&quot; in my book because it requires making probabilistic decisions that have no place in, say, Chess.",1450973479

10788551,comment,10786512,10787517,0,0,pcwalton,,,"> I feel like a new systems language needs to come and make aliasing explicit in a way, so that it doesn&#x27;t surprise programmers but still allows them to get the optimizations that they want. Tracking uniqueness like Rust is a good first step, but it doesn&#x27;t work for unsafe code or anything with more subtle aliasing relationships.<p>I think it could be added to Rust. :)<p>Uniqueness can be viewed as just a starting point. It&#x27;s a conservative subset of more sophisticated systems like PALE. Since it&#x27;s a subset, it could be expanded to the full system eventually.<p>I think the biggest problem is not implementing it or finding a way to slot it into the language design but rather making it easy enough to use to achieve widespread adoption. Rust already stretches the boundaries of programmers&#x27; willingness to learn new type systems/static analyses to control aliasing, and it has, as you point out, a very simple system. In fact, I think it&#x27;s unproven that programmers will be willing to adopt such a system en masse at all†, since Rust is still niche. If and when Rust really takes off in widespread production, we&#x27;ll have proof that programmers are willing to adopt aliasing information in the type system.<p>† It&#x27;ll be interesting to see how the ISO Core C++ lifetime checker fares here. I&#x27;m not optimistic about how much use it will get due to complexity and effectively being a different language from C++, but I&#x27;d love to be proven wrong.",1450973081

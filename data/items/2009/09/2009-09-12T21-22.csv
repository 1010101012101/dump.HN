819504,comment,819217,819217,0,0,gcv,,,"The general point of the article rings true with me. An early prototype helps pinpoint the hotspots of complexity, which were probably not at all obvious in the design stage. I have run into this with my programming. I tend to start out with an overly-complicated model, and whittle away extraneous junk which do not improve flexibility or expressive power.<p>Now about chairs. I find the general idea fascinating --- the Holy Grail of chair design conforms to the user with no adjustments and stays there with no special use of the user's muscles (for example, there should be no need to fiddle with a tilt limiter or tilt tension; I should be able to just sit back at precisely the angle I want right now, and the chair should stay there; if I change my sitting angle, the chair should follow and stay in the new position). If this Setu chair does this, fantastic. It certainly pushes the envelope of task chair design by providing bases different from the usual 5-tentacle rolling octopus, a strong point in its favor.<p>The article says that this group produced the Mirra. I hope it learned from its mistakes with the Mirra, which has an uncomfortably hard and inflexible back. Strangely, Herman-Miller's web site lists the Setu chair in its ""multipurpose"" category, not its ""work"" category. I'll reserve judgement until I find a place to try it out, but it's hard to do worse than the uncomfortable Celle, or the Embody (ugly, heavy, outrageously expensive, and not even comfortable). The Aeron remains the gold standard, but it is starting to look a little dated (in a nice way, I suppose), and it does require a decent amount of fiddling.",1252792095

That would require a perfect meritocracy.  Do you really believe that what we live in, in this world?  Of the Forbes 400, around 70% inherited more than a million or came from wealthy backgrounds.[1]  (So for the vast majority, they actually, quite literally, got it from Daddy.)<p><i>You get paid by doing or making something people want, and those who make more money are often simply better at doing what people want. Top actors make a lot more money than B-list actors.</i><p>Are top actors better actors than B-list?  Sometimes, but often not.  They usually were in more popular films.  And that's often a consequence of what other films came out when it opened, the editor, the opening-day weather, etc.  There are a thousand factors that go into making a film and an actor doesn't have a lot of control over them when signing on to a project.<p>It's called luck.  Actors are on an upward spiral or a downward spiral and it almost never has anything to do with their acting or ""giving people what they want"".  It would be nice if the world was less complex place, but it's not.  So are they getting paid vastly more because they're worth it, or because there can only be so many top actors and they happen to be one.  Natural monopolies are more than just dams and bridges, and for the fortunate in them, there's nothing meritocratic about it.<p><i>When we say that one kind of work is overpaid and another underpaid, what are we really saying? In a free market, prices are determined by what buyers want.</i><p>But in a free market, with no oversight, we would get dangerous chemicals in our food, kids pajamas that explode from a spark, etc.  You know all those crazy regulations we have?  A lot of them are because companies tried to violate those exact rules.  A market may say it's OK to sneak imflammable chemicals into those pajamas. A market may say it's OK that a clerk can make $2/hour -- but we can then say, no, that's not enough for the clerk to live on.  You can vote with how you spend your money, but you can also vote at the polls.  They're both valid ways of getting things done.<p>The difference is like that between hard and soft skills.  Managing a group of great hard-skill guys who can't work together and can't be managed is high-performance/low-control.  A bunch of guys who communicate and work well together, but don't get anything done, and you have high-control/low-performance.  The trick is to mix hard and soft skills to get both.  Both market and social concerns are valid and need to be monitored, tuned.  A baseball player is payed a lot?  People are willing to pay a lot to see him.  Good for him; he got dollar votes.  A woman is working two part-time minimum wage jobs because neither company wants to make her full-time to avoid paying benefits and she still can't feed her family?  Not good for her, or us to allow it; we need to vote at the polls.<p><i>One often hears a policy criticized on the grounds that it would increase the income gap between rich and poor. As if it were an axiom that this would be bad.</i><p>At a certain extreme, in either direction, it can be devastating.  I don't tink I have to defend that the ""no income gap"" is a calamity.  But at a certain point the other way and you also get devastating results.  It's a fine balance.  With a large disparity in income, you get lower economic mobility and society as a whole suffers tremendously. It creates huge problems that are well documented and easy to see if you simply travel.  There's been a lot of work done on this [2], and the best I can put simply is that if the gap gets too big, instead of increasing motivation it decreases it, much as with an extended duration of being unemployed.<p><i>You need rich people in your society not so much because in spending their money they create jobs, but because of what they have to do to get rich.</i><p>Again, you're fantasizing that this is all a meritocracy.  Most wealthy people were born that way.  We all hear of large leaps of economic mobility based on merit, but that's unfortunately the exception.  I'm not saying, ""Don't let people get rich.""  I'm saying, ""There is nothing that the incentive of $50 million at a 35% tax rate will give you that $50 million at 45% won't.""  And yet if that 10% is spent on education and other enablers of economic mobility, your pool of Henry Fords who can build that tractor just got bigger.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.faireconomy.org/press_room/1997/born_on_third_base_sources_of_wealth_of_1997_forbes_400"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.faireconomy.org/press_room/1997/born_on_third_bas...</a>)

819464,comment,818840,819176,0,0,dlsspy,,,"One of the frustrating differences I ran into is the callback mechanism in tornado.  You can't attach more than one callback, and the one kind of callback does two different things (meaning the callback has to determine whether or not the call was successful before it does its work).<p>To me, this makes things more complicated.  What if I want to use the same error handling code for all bits of code (really common for me is `d.addErrback(log.err)` to just log it), but each successful call has to do something different?<p>Twisted deferreds also allow you to <i>compose</i> chains.<p>This is a somewhat trivial example, but by having the callback do both success and error cases, I had to build an adaptor to pass to callbacks to include the ""is this a failure"" information.<p>The easy way to do that is to create a wrapper class and construct it one way or another based on whether a success or error occurred.  I ended up just composing it like this:<p><pre><code>    deferred.addCallback(lambda x: Response(body=x))
    deferred.addErrback(lambda e: Response(error=e))
    deferred.addCallback(lambda r: callback(r, *args, **kwargs))
</code></pre>
The first callback and errback create a Response (wrapper) object that contains either a body or an error.  The second callback receives the response that was made by one of the above and calls the initial callback.<p>This is sort of unrolling complexity and sweeping it away.  The <i>real</i> problem is that you can only have one callback in tornado (and you can't easily chain them).  That means that what actually happens when this deferred's callback fires is that it ends up calling the original callback, which is an inner wrapper function inside of another function that calls a curried function that calls your original callback -- and you have to create these things by name when you're building out your auth class.<p>To me, <i>that's</i> complicated.<p>deferreds seem like there's more involved than you get with a simple callback until you actually try to <i>use</i> the simple callback.<p>The interesting properties of deferreds are<p>1) You can add multiple callbacks and errbacks and build chains as complicated as your system needs including <i>composing</i> common cases (such as success and error counters).<p>2) If a callback (or errback) returns a deferred, you spin off another dimension of the chain.<p>#2 is why the above code and about twenty lines of web.py exist for a single use case.<p>Here's a concrete example (close to something I do in the real world™):<p>Imagine a simple twitter API.  You go grab a tweet and then give it to something else:  `t.grabTweet(something).addCallback(processTweet)`<p>Now someone adds a requirement that between `grabTweet` and `processTweet` you want to perform short URL expansion.  In twisted, I'd just toss an `addCallback(expandURL)` in the middle and call my awesomely well-tested URL expander -- which makes an async http call to another service and doesn't call the next callback in the chain until that service returns the data I need to fill satisfy the request.<p>And then after I did that, I found that the URL expansion stuff I was using was blowing up the upstream and causing me to fail to expand some, so I added async cache support to those <i>inside</i> the API (not as an additional toplevel callback).  For this new step, the toplevel API doesn't change, but now I can do more async stuff that may lead to further async stuff without having to write additional glue code.",1252790100

The impression I received from the post I was responding to was that the poster was suggesting a positive correlation between the general level of fearfulness in a population and the strictness of the gun laws in the region. Canadians would presumably be much more fearful than Americans in that case.  I don't have any statistics to compare, sadly, but at the very least I would think it safe to say that any such relation is decidedly less than linear (or my neighbourhood would be overrun by paranoids), if such a relation exists at all.",1252789785

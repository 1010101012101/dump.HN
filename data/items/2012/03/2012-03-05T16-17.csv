I have every confidence that this is probably a very cool thing.<p>But judging from that opening description, I gather that Datomic puts the data and analysis in the same application.

3667173,comment,3666564,3666564,14,0,jarrett,,,"Homakov kind of gave the impression he had discovered a previously unknown vulnerability in Rails. This is not the case. Rather, he discovered an instance in which one very prominent Rails app (Github) failed to implement a standard Rails security practice.<p>For those not familiar with Rails, it boils down to this: You as the programmer need to use a security feature built into Rails called <i>mass assignment security.</i> If you fail to use this feature, you have a vulnerability. In other words, the <i>default</i> is insecure by design. The alternative would be to make Rails secure by default, but that would mean pretty much nothing would work until you explicitly granted access where necessary. I guess the core team figured ""not working by default"" was worse than ""insecure by default.""<p>Homakov obviously disagreed with this design decision. I can understand why, and I mostly feel the same way.<p>So Homakov posted an issue to the Rails repo Github (<a href=""https://github.com/rails/rails/issues/5228"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/rails/rails/issues/5228</a>) suggesting the default be changed. He made a good case and was initially polite. A few days passed, and nobody else had posted to his thread.<p>So, presumably to draw attention to this issue, he exploited the fact that Github had failed to use mass assignment protection. Specifically, he posted a comment with a far-future timestamp, which obviously should be impossible. (I think that's what he did, although Github seems to to have fixed the timestamp now.) He then said this should be proof enough that the Rails defaults need to be changed.<p>The problem with Homakov's argument, as pointed out in subsequent comments in the thread, is that Homakov's hack only demonstrated a mistake on <i>Github's</i> part, not a bug in Rails. It didn't prove anything about Rails that we didn't already know. The only thing surprising he demonstrated was that Github had left open a rather serious vulnerability.<p>TL;DR: Rails has some less-than-secure defaults which all Rails developers are expected to understand and deal with. Homakov found out that Github failed to do so in at least one instance, and he wanted to use that as proof the Rails defaults should be changed.",1330966684

Twitter builds the page, loads the layout, and initializes the client-side script, which makes a JSON request to pull an individual tweet after everything has loaded.<p>This means that to get the requested information on first load, the user has to wait for a 2MB download, followed by another roundtrip Ajax request to twitters tweet retrieval API.  This results in the <i>perception</i> of a slow page load, even though the tweet itself comes down the pipe in only 100ms.<p>In my view, Twitter is an excellent case study in some of the pitfalls of thick-client application design.  Mainly that ignoring the first-time-use case will result in widespread perception among users that your app is slow, even when every page view after the first is lightning fast.",1330965702

2) As pents90 said, rating system is pretty tricky for legal content, but we do track signatures and data to help people identify the most used documents. There's a discussion page for every document, where you can share questions and opinions, tell us if you need a specific version, etc

A few years ago that school got a new principal.  She went from being one of the top performing teachers based on evaluations to the bottom of the list.  This isn't because she's a bad teacher, but because she and the principal didn't get along.  At the end of last year, she quit that job and got a new position in a new district.  First evaluation this year?  Right back to the top again.<p>On top of that, the new district has a completely different outlook on how to deal with parents amongst other things.  The old school and district would bend over backward for parents even if they were completely in the wrong.  The new district will at least try to take an objective view of any issues, including input from the teacher.<p>What does that do for a teacher's morale?

The per thread overhead, including user stack, kernel stack and control structures are at a minimum of ~8K.

Much like API design, a logo/mascot/etc, once you commit to it, is <i>very hard to change.</i> People talk about software that scales, but keep in mind, <i>identities need to scale</i> too. The standard logo/identity course in any design program goes into this and forces you to think about identity not only as a mascot, but as a <i>system.</i><p>This isn't to say that any of the submissions proffered wouldn't be valuable, they might be! But the whole thing that happens when you pick up a designer is that you also are implicitly asking them to research how your brand/logo appears on a shirt, on a business card, in press clippings, on sponsorship banners, and so forth.<p>These are all things that are incredibly easy to ignore because, unless you've done this before, it's really hard to get an identity right the first time.<p>Also, why's it gotta be an animal?

3666935,comment,3666564,3666881,1,0,adriand,,,"Yes, if there is anything else in the public key table that you don't want to be updated via form fields, then you should be protecting yourself against it.  However, every developer - or at minimum, every experienced developer - should know the basic maxim ""never trust the data from your users"".<p>But this method does protect resources from being arbitrarily assigned to other users.<p>In any controller where the user should be authenticated, I would suggest the following two guidelines (let's assume the model is PublicKey, as before):<p>1. In the index action, where you get a list of resources, use:<p><pre><code>    @keys = current_user.public_keys
</code></pre>
2. In all of the actions (such as show, edit, update, etc.) where the method starts with:<p><pre><code>    @key = PublicKey.find(params[:id])
</code></pre>
Remove that method and instead create a private method in your controller:<p><pre><code>    def get_key
      @key = current_user.public_keys.find(params[:id]) if params[:id]
    end
</code></pre>
And at the top of your controller:<p><pre><code>    before_filter :get_key
</code></pre>
This should just be a habit.  With these two modifications, you've just scoped the resource down to the user everywhere that it is used.  Additionally, you've DRYed out your single resource-specific actions (show, edit, etc.) because the code to find the resource only exists in one place.<p>Of course, you still need to think about attr_accessible.  But even this is not a panacea.  Consider the case where a user has a role_id field that specifies whether they are an admin, manager, or regular user.  In this three role scenario, managers are allowed to create managers or regular users, but not admins.  Admins can create users of all three roles.<p>This means that you may want to allow the role_id to be updated by mass assignment.  You just have to ensure that users cannot update the role_id if the role they have picked is more privileged than their current role.  You could just add a validator to the user model that does exactly that.<p>Alternatively, you could keep role_id as a blacklisted attribute, but in your controller you could check for the new role in the params, and then only assign it if the user should be able to assign it.  Both approaches have merit.  The bottom-line is that you still have to THINK.",1330963395

Second, porting a large program from one language to another is not a trivial ""optimization"", so if you suspect a problem may need the speed, it's probably wise to use a suitable language in the first place.",1200626411

100127,comment,100127,99802,0,0,tlrobinson,,,"I actually (partially) agree. I think that any company that wishes to be a OpenID provider should also be a relying party. I wouldn't use Yahoo or any of the other big guys as my provider anyway, though.<p>I don't think sites should be reluctant to accept OpenID. It's more convenient for users to sign up, so if OpenID catches on (which obviously Yahoo thinks it will), they would likely get more (and happier) users. I'm not sure why you think support costs would be higher, since the OpenID provider is responsible for managing the user's account (lost passwords, etc...)<p>OpenID is very different from Passport, namely since OpenID is <i>open</i>, not controlled by Microsoft. As I've said before, if you're so worried about ""corporate overlords"" spying on you, there's a simple solution: be your own Open ID provider. It's very easy if you've every set up a simple website before.",1200625832

The struggle to articulate our beliefs is a struggle to form them. Non-writers often seem to &quot;just know&quot; what they think, which is to me quite remarkable. But they also frequently lack the tools to analyze their beliefs and how they are constructed, because they never have to go through the slow and painful process of figuring them out.",1419897574

It&#x27;s quite inevitable that it will, unlike all previous eras, there won&#x27;t be new jobs for humans because it&#x27;s human thinking that&#x27;s going to be automated.  Robots destroy jobs, that&#x27;s a fact; sometimes, that creates new jobs, but it&#x27;s usually always far less jobs for far more skilled humans and that pattern is and must come to an end.  Jobs that require smarter humans don&#x27;t work for the vast majority of barely capable humans that exist.<p>Mass unemployment is coming, the masses aren&#x27;t capable of knowledge jobs and labor jobs are being taken over by machines, what other possible outcome do you see?",1419897558

Why? Because the customer didn&#x27;t want to interrupt his users even though in our opinion the proxy state was out of whack. This created a nightmare for us because it was hard to debug. We ended up fork()-ing and aborting on the side to debug the cores.",1419897543

The problem is that the younger generation wants Big Brother to know everything, and that is sad and scary. One need look no further than the comments on this thread for proof.<p>We are not teaching our children the value of humanity, and the way that privacy creates a sense of self. &quot;Self&quot; is now what you make it on Twitter/Facebook/SocialNetDuJour. Sharing everything in a way that government/Facebook/Google can monitor (&quot;Big Brother&quot;) is like breathing to the youth who&#x27;ve had iPhones since before puberty.<p>So many younger programmers think RMS is absurd. They don&#x27;t even have context to understand where he comes from. RMS has been foretelling the future since the days of the GNU wars.

8812514,comment,8811581,8812362,0,0,angersock,,,"Just finished The Peripheral in an evening binge, and honestly I don&#x27;t care for it.<p>Gibson, in the Sprawl trilogy (probably his best works), and the associated short stories, used to do a much better job of focusing on the characters. You usually had some lower-class or poor folks scurrying about, trying to eke out a living. I likened it to a friend once as ants fighting on the edges of glaciers: fierce, crude, and utterly inconsequential in the orbits of their environs.<p>The problem I had with Peripheral, as well as with Zero History, is that he&#x27;s fallen into &quot;Oh, hey, here&#x27;s a bunch of rich people--so super rich you can&#x27;t even imagine--and they&#x27;ll just deus ex machina everything along&quot;. I <i>hate</i> that.<p>In the earlier works, those characters (the dim spectre of Maas Biotech, or the Tessier-Ashpool for example) are just background threads, occasionally injecting events or setting the stage, and focus is kept on the minions and protagonists. In Peripheral, the real badguy is just dull &quot;oh and then <i>this</i> evil thing happened&quot;, and the rich people are kind of separated from any of the action and stakes that matter. Indeed, the central conceit of the story is such that, by definition, there is no real impact beyond a slightly-higher-than-normal gentleman&#x27;s game going on.<p>Contrast this with Case, or Armitage, or Automatic Jack, or any of those characters in the Sprawl verse. Those characters occasionally directly deal with high-up powers, constantly get used by them, and are fully aware of it, and yet there is the very real chance that maybe--just maybe, if they play their cards right--they could <i>perhaps</i> get a <i>slim</i> chance to act instead of react. No such setup is available in Peripheral.<p>Moreover, I&#x27;m really disappointed in the way that Homes and the veteran stuff is handled. Like, I kind of dig the &quot;haptic veterans&quot; human refuse thing, I get some of the used-world feel, but honestly it all feels kind of phoned in. Contrast this with what Stephenson pulled off twenty years ago, or even what Gibson himself pulled off in Count Zero. Like, the notes are there, but there&#x27;s no soul behind it.",1419897126

But they won&#x27;t find it for most labor because of two factors:<p>1.) At the most efficient time usage (under politically impossible configurations and assuming equal productivity), in which people work 18 hour days forever and utilize 6 hours of sleep, 1 machine&#x27;s labor equals 1.25 human&#x27;s labor.  Typically, 1 machine&#x27;s labor equals 3 human&#x27;s labor.  Accounting for productivity enhancement, the comparison will be about as worthwhile to make as comparing engines to horses today.  (My drone is 500 plebpower?)<p>2.) It takes 12 years (again, under politically impossible standards) and ~18,000 pounds of food to make a human productive.  It takes a drone a few weeks to be born out of a few gallons of fuel, and a few pounds of materials.<p>The real cost of labor is staggering.  And if you think people are stupid enough to fall for the trap (again) to use the productive gains of a new technology to do nothing more than cycle it all back into a mechanism to breed more humans into existence, I think you will be in for a rude awakening when human costs drop so low from endless inflation appeasement that using said drones to harvest these surplus humans for their physical materials becomes wildly profitable.  And if the charlatans can make even HackerNews believe North Korea was behind the Sony hacks and clamor for invasion, just imagine how easy it will be to manufacture some social justice narrative for mining populations centers for biomaterials.  (&quot;Those evil sexists need to be mined!  For great equality!&quot;)<p>TL;DR: Once the price of human labor drops to sub-zero levels due to political appeasement via inflation to counter &quot;good-enough&quot; drones, it will be more profitable to crush human organization than promote it.",1419897124

Rather than dispatching purely on the type of their first argument (as in Python) or into a class hierarchy/namespace based on that argument, then by parameter types (ala Java) Julia methods are fully qualified over every parameter type.<p>Sadly, that makes it hard to ask the question &quot;what methods can I call on an object of this type?&quot; because the answer might include functions with that type in <i>any</i> parameter position. In many cases that wouldn&#x27;t be a meaningful answer - as in the case of, say, a numeric type which could be used for all kinds of indexing, iteration, and offset methods involving collections, IO handles, etc.<p>You might benefit a bit more from using the &#x27;apropos&#x27; builtin to lookup functions based on simple keyword matching.

One doesn’t prove axioms.” is interesting.  What&#x27;s chosen as an axiom, and why, is an advanced question.  Unless you get into foundations of mathematics, that question is seldom addressed. It&#x27;s way beyond most pre-college math teachers.  It&#x27;s the sort of question that occurs to smart kids, but there&#x27;s no easy answer you can give them. The usual answers are theological, and boil down to &quot;shut up, kid&quot;.  Here&#x27;s a discussion on Stack Exchange of that subject: <a href=""http://math.stackexchange.com/questions/127158/in-what-sense-are-math-axioms-true"" rel=""nofollow"">http://math.stackexchange.com/questions/127158/in-what-sense...</a><p>(If you get into automatic theorem proving, you have to address such issues head-on. Adding an inconsistent axiom can create a contradiction and break the system.  This leads to constructive mathematics, Russell and Whitehead, Boyer and Moore, and an incredible amount of grinding just to get the basics of arithmetic and number theory locked down solid. In constructive mathematics, commutativity of integer addition is a provable theorem, not an axiom.<p>I once spent time developing and machine-proving a constructive theory of arrays, without the &quot;axioms&quot; of set theory.  The &quot;axioms&quot; of arrays are in fact provable as theorems using constructive methods. It took a lot of automated case analysis, but I was able to come up with a set of theorems which the Boyer-Moore prover could prove in sequence to get to the usual rules for arrays. Some mathematicians who looked at that result didn&#x27;t like seeing so much grinding needed to prove things that seemed fundamental.  This was in the 1980s; today&#x27;s mathematicians would not be bothered by a need for mechanized case analysis.)",1419896062

This is the way of technology: obsolete work becomes automated.

Do you want to plow your land with your bare hands? No! Do you want to drive taxis? No!<p>There&#x27;s a special point regarding driving taxis: it&#x27;s one of the most dangerous jobs currently available. Moreover, the taxi industry is infamously exploitative of drivers, such that the competition from Uber/Lyft is actually <i>raising</i> taxi drivers&#x27; wages in the interim.[0]<p>I did not expect the logical conclusion of RMS&#x27; argument to be ludditism. I find this surprising.<p>> Uber is an unregulated near-monopoly, so it can cut rates for drivers arbitrarily.<p>I think this is an unrealistic long-term view. The rideshare market has low barriers to entry and a high potential for competition, such that I expect to eventually see this market fragmented among many isomorphic companies (Lyft, Uber, SideCar, etc.), perhaps more so on a local than on a global level.

We raised a $2.5M seed round and a $7.5M Series A. At no point during our seed and Series A (the time period you&#x27;re talking about) would it have made any financial sense for the founders to cash out even a penny. We felt this way because we had and still have genuine intentions of building a huge company, and every penny should be invested in growing the company. If we had instead felt differently, we would have tried to cash out some of our equity (which we didn&#x27;t), and that should have been a red flag for investors to stay away.<p>There&#x27;s nothing wrong with trying to build a company to flip it for a few million in a year. Even better if you can do it without taking any outside money.

It means that you have to think for a second about the most appropriate forum for that discussion. And if you decide that you do need to talk to someone, the friction isn&#x27;t really that high. Click on a user, click on the green button with the camera on it, and you&#x27;re talking.<p>In-person spontaneous collaboration is, in my experience as both a developer and a development manager, highly overrated, and the value is very rarely worth the costs. Those costs include lost productivity, developer stress, bikeshedding, and an implicit culture of hostility to anything that doesn&#x27;t _look_ like productivity (like thinking).<p>Taking a moment to put on my development manager hat, one of the things I never want to do to my developer employees is interrupt their flow. I go to meetings, so I can give them a brief summary which contains only the information they need to do their job. I work with the customers and listen to 50 minutes of rambling so I can glean the 5 minutes of information my employees need to do their work.<p>I&#x27;ve hired them, and I&#x27;m paying them ludicrous amounts of money, to create programs; to create value for the customer. Anything that gets in that way is up to me to address and remove. And based on my experience as both a developer and a manager, those &quot;spontaneous collaboration&quot; interruptions are usually something that needs to be addressed and removed.",1419894164

Sometimes, I couldn&#x27;t do as good a job on concurrent projects, but was afraid to do things sequentially or turn down projects.<p>FWIW, the business and sales skills tptacek talks about end up helping when the startup bug strikes again ... which it probably will.<p>It&#x27;s been said elsewhere, but one of the most important things is to hold firm on price, probably a much higher price than feels reasonable coming from startups. If you&#x27;re not charging by the project, charge by day, not by hour. You have extra costs as a freelancer, and you provide extra value.  So build that in.",1419894096

Then let users browse your database of companies (and/or the products they&#x27;re pushing) and actively search for what they went. Filters could be ecological stance of the company, color or style of the product, user reviews, published &quot;expert&quot; reviews, etc. Turn all that data over to the user and let them be in control of what ads they see. Let them spy on advertisers instead of vice-versa. It would also be way cheaper since you don&#x27;t have to maintain this vast data-collecting network.",1419894018

I can&#x27;t quite put my finger on it but it has something to do with assuming that the institutions of the elite (businesses, government, colleges) are driven by meritocratic impulse primarily.<p>This leaves out elements of human motivation like tribalism, pure status seeking, creative impulse, absurdism...there is a veritable smorgasbord of human attributes that defy quantification.",1378461524

For example, postfix has the &#x27;smtpd_recipient_restrictions&#x27; directive.",1378461490

My issue is that .on() continues to work as if I&#x27;m connected for the client who is originating changes locally but that all other clients are blind. I think the app developer should be able to choose that .on() only triggers once firebase really calls back.<p>In addition, it should be possible to create a safety net using localStorage so that unsynced data can be saved and put back into play after a page refresh. So I think this problem is very fixable.",1378461451

I hear a lot more horror stories about people being discouraged from sufficiently challenging material than being pushed into it - <a href=""http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/1lrvit/what_memory_from_school_still_makes_you_rage/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/1lrvit/what_memor...</a> has a lot of examples, to pick one random internet thread from this week. One thing that we can fully agree on is that NCLB is horrible policy. Uniform education, with no catering to the genuine interests and capacities, is stupid; only a few alternatives, like not educating the majority of people, or basing education on statistical arguments about amorphous groups rather than individual merit, are stupider.<p>Our civilizations, for the most part, don&#x27;t cultivate genius, unfortunately. And geniuses aren&#x27;t radically less common in some groups, unless you mean groups like &quot;people who suffered severe childhood malnutrition&quot;. Normal schools aren&#x27;t really set up to deal with people with IQs more than a standard deviation, or perhaps two standard deviations, from the norm.<p>If you define genius to be an IQ of 160+, and model it as a Gaussian with a standard deviation of 15, most schools have no geniuses of any race. If you take a more-reasonable fat-tailed distribution, many schools still don&#x27;t.<p>My personal, anecdotal bias: the best school I went to was  quite small, and had several geniuses - including a black one. There weren&#x27;t many black kids, but the ones who were there were exceptional; I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if they had the highest average IQ of any ethnic group at the school (and yes, there were plenty of Asian and Jewish students, from several countries).",1378461405

The gradual, step-wise release of information about the NSA&#x27;s surveillance capabilities has been quite effective in two different ways.<p>First, it has kept the NSA in the headlines for almost three months now (quite a feat when you consider our cultural attention span is usually measured in fractions of days).<p>Second, it has let officials make denials and give reassurances come back to haunt them and tarnish then credibility when further disclosures are made (consider that Senator Feinstein, chair of the Intelligence Committee supposedly providing Congressional oversight of these surveillance programs, who spent weeks claiming said oversight was quite robust, admitted to not knowing about the internal NSA audit finding thousands of privacy violations).<p>I&#x27;m pretty confident there will be more disclosures.

I ended up writing most of it in the browser. Then the killer feature of ScribTeX for me was that it didn&#x27;t require registration; you could use it from anywhere right away if you had your TeX files with you on a flash drive. It wasn&#x27;t that registering or logging in was hard, mind you, but not having to do it completely bypassed the mental barrier of entering your password in a  potentially unsafe environment like a malware-infested university computer lab. Later you would be at a safer computer (e.g., your own), log in to ScribTeX and upload your document to it as an off-site backup.",1378460259

Here in my country nobody knows what anthropology is. The only hope for those who want to stay in the &quot;business&quot; is to beg for a lousy scholarship and starve for years doing a PhD and waiting for some old professor to retire and make a room for a young and aspiring researcher (who by the time it happens won&#x27;t be young anymore).<p>Still, I&#x27;ve been very lucky compared with my friends from the university. I&#x27;ve got a decent job in a large insurance corporation, doing a little bit of PR and mainly monitoring the work of debt collectors abroad.<p>Mostly it&#x27;s a very repetitive, limited, not creative, nine-to-five kind of job, with a very annoying, over-controlling, nosy, bipolar colleague.<p>I&#x27;ve had enough, although my salary rose by 36% in the last year.<p>I would like to move abroad, but I am limited by my predominantly soft skills and lack of serious experience (I&#x27;m 27). And I&#x27;m not a native Englih speaker.<p>During my studies I was researching new technologies in education and I am very much interested in human-computer interacion, usability and design. I know I cannot compete with so many great wizzard programmers, I am not an alogorithm genius, but I do not intend to be. Nowadays there are so many great software engineers all over the world and the market becames more and more saturated with sophisticated devices I believe it is the client&#x27;s research which will make the difference and help to turn a good idea into millions.<p>However, at least here in my country, in order to get into R&D one has to graduade in some computer science related subject.<p>So next month I am starting a new degree in applied computer science :)<p>But going back to the core problem of not enjoying your job:<p>I agree with Arjuna - you should consider relocation. I live just 10 minutes walking away from my office. I pay high rent, but the comfort of life without having to commute anywhere is beyond description. I highly encourage all to consider it.<p>Secondly - if you are having a problem with a colleague, or with some aspect of what you do, then treat it not as an offence (&quot;the world hates me!&quot;) but rather as an intellectual, personal challange (&quot;hmm, it&#x27;s interesting - why do I react in such a way?&quot;), an opportunity to grow, an excercise that will make you stronger. As others said: there will always be things and people you don&#x27;t like in your future jobs, but the goal is not to strive for a perfect environment without these problems, but to develop strategies to deal with them.<p>I hate reporting. But I knew it was something I have to turn into an interesting challange and to learn something new, or it would kill me. Now I must say I make the best reports our clients ever received. In the course of doing so I turned myself into an advanced user of Business Objects, automated the process to the furthest extent and delegated the manual stuff to my colleagues - what in the beginning took at least 2 days of solid work on the reports alone now takes just about 1 hour!<p>We&#x27;re young. And I believe everything is possible. If I am able to turn myself into a mediocre computer scientist, working full time and having to pay for my studies, you are able to become whatever you want.<p>Cheers!",1378460052

That goes for the food industry, as well as the fitness supplement industry. The answer is eating the right foods and to be on some sort of food plan.<p>I read at the end of 2011 a comment here on HN about the 4hb and how it changed some dudes life. So I read and applied and it changed my life, as well as some of my family members. So I am going to recommend to the people that want to lose their body fat, The Four Hour Body.<p>Obesity is a big problem in this country. At my local grocery store there is an entire section cut out for scooters and I kid you not 20-30 people in a scooter when its busy. And these aren&#x27;t old people scooters. I saw scooter traffic jam the other day, made me feel like I was in South Park. But not even sure where these people would start, its almost like they committed suicide with food and now are just being. Life is not easy and eating shit is a legal way to cope. We all have our crutches.",1378458532

You can get an &quot;auditor&quot; to pass anything you want if you control the assumptions of the model.<p>NBNCo have already had to progressively change their projections for rollout time, rollout penetration and end user takeup.

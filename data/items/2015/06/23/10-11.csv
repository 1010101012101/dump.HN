The key difference is the &quot;precompliance review&quot; part. Unlike when cops show up at your door, you can challenge the subpoena in court before having to respond to it.

Don&#x27;t worry, we can fix your pride problem with these tasks below:<p>I don&#x27;t have to acknowledge anything. Anyone knows that javac does not execute code on the Android platform. As such talking about whatever influence it might have on runtime performance, besides peephole optimizations, constant folding and similar AOT optimizations only reveals ignorance about the Android stack.<p>> 1. Dalvik and ART don&#x27;t take jar files as input, so it is impossible to get your brownie points. Learn why.<p>Yes they do. Jar files get converted into dex files, which means the same file can be used as canonical input for both platforms.<p>Then again we are learning about Android aren&#x27;t we?<p>> 2. Oracle&#x27;s Hotspot targets x86 and x86-64, and Dalvik and ART are mostly focused on ARM. Learn the difference between ISAs.<p>Maybe you are the  one that should inform yourself about Oracle and certified partners Java JIT and AOT compilers for ARM platforms.<p>Learn about the Java eco-system.<p>> 3. Hotspot and Dalvik make different tradeoffs between CPU and memory both in their choices of garbage collectors and in their JIT strategies. Think about why that would be.<p>Of course they do different tradeoffs. The ones made by Dalvik and ART are worse than approaches taken by other Java vendors, hence why they generate worse code, which leads to bad performance.<p>Learn about commercial embedded JVMs.<p>>4. The word &quot;compiler&quot; by itself refers to a program that translates source code into object code. Notably, an assembler is not usually considered to be a compiler, and JIT &quot;compilers&quot; were originally called dynamic translators for three decades, with JIT compiler only appearing in the 90s. Given that terminology background, figure out why most people would call javac a compiler but not Hotspot or Apple&#x27;s Rosetta.<p>Learn about Xerox PARC documentation and its references JIT compilers.<p>Or better yet feel free to dive into OS/400 documentation about its kernel level JIT compiler.<p>All of which go back a little earlier than the 90&#x27;s",1435057077

9763790,comment,9759639,9762283,0,0,vacri,,,"Everything gets shoehorned into the one tag. Originating repo, image name, version. So next time you pull &quot;x/y:latest&quot;, the current holder of that tag loses <i>everything</i>. You see an image in the list with nothing listed - no repo and no image name, when it should just lose the &#x27;latest&#x27; tag. If I have multiple images on a machine, I now can&#x27;t tell which are the old images from a particular repo (well... I can guess by image size), and that&#x27;s not great if I want to roll back. There is no reason for an image to automatically lose a tag describing where it came from.<p>It also means you have to tag twice using the full tag if you want build numbers: this build is &quot;x/y:latest&quot; and &quot;x/y:v1.2.3&quot;, when you could just do &quot;latest&quot; and &quot;v1.2.3&quot;. Similarly, when you pull an image, it should pull all tags associated with that layer, so you pull &#x27;latest&#x27; and it also brings the tag &#x27;v1.2.3&#x27;. This seemed to be the case with the docker v1.5, but it seems inconsistent in 1.6. I haven&#x27;t had time to nail down that suspicion, though.<p>There are other bits that could do with polish (like being able to do multiple tags at once, rather than push afresh for each one), but the main problem is the single tag field. Given the amount of metadata they already store for an image, this seems a strange behaviour to suffer.",1435056794

The details of &quot;what&quot; can be seen by looking at the diffs. Where the details of &quot;why&quot; go is split. Why you chose a particular method over others available? Any constants or magic numbers you think might need clarifying when someone else looks? You&#x27;ve done something that looks odd/unnecessary at first glance in order to work around a bug/limitation beyond your immediate control? Those things go in comments in the code. Just about everything else goes in the ticket and possibly makes its way to other documentation, there is not point cluttering the code up too much (unless your implementation documentation is all in-code and you use tools to extract it into other forms, as I&#x27;ve seen done before now, in whic case everything goes in there). &quot;FIXME&quot; and &quot;TODO&quot; markers can go in the code too though generally you want them gone for release (if they survive between releases then they should really be feature requests in your backlog rather than just code markers, so they can be tracked/managed/prioritised as needed.<p>What really grinds my gears is commits without any comment at all.",1435056580

So it was my plan to take a higher paying job outside of games to save the money to pay that. However, Cambridge has a policy of not wanting the students to work while they study, so the costs are higher as I will also need to provide more living costs than initially expected and my saving plan has accounted for.<p>I am very new to academia but it seems the standard way to solve this seems to be to approach the different funding organisations which offer limited amounts or through the Colleges. Unfortunately, for quite a lot of these I am not eligible, ironically, due to the income at my new job, age (I am 25 and a lot of them cut off at 24) and having been working for the years since leaving University in 2012. Others do not provide funding due to the course being an MPhil, not the standard MEng, MSci etc. as well as a few other things.<p>So, I am a little lost in the process and feel I might be missing something obvious.<p>The plan going forward, if I am actually on the right track, is to begin approaching businesses once I have confirmed my research subject. Based on my assigned supervisor and my research proposals the subject is looking likely to be in the area of developing GPGPU techniques for spacial recognition problems.<p>If anyone has any advice or guidance in this area I would love to hear it, especially if I have just went down the entirely wrong route in approaching this!<p>Thanks",1435055884

I read the page for RunC and the only thing I could find out about it from that page is that it is a &quot;Container&quot;, and these are its specs. A &quot;Container&quot; is something that is used by &quot;Docker&quot;. &quot;Docker&quot; is a program that &quot;allows you to compose your application from microservices&quot;. A &quot;microservice&quot; is &quot;a software architecture style, in which complex applications are composed of small, independent processes&quot; (we&#x27;re down to wikipedia at this point). So a &quot;microservice&quot; is an abstraction of unix design, and finally we&#x27;re on solid ground. If you were interested you might be able to work backwards through this list of projects, researching what each one does, and then you could find out what RunC actually is.",1435053982

A great example is Victoria station, where trying to get onto the Victoria line can take up to 15 minutes at 5pm. Instead, head down to the District Line, then follow signs to the Victoria line once you’re down the escalators. You’ll beat the rush, and as a bonus, come onto the platforms at the quieter end.\n&quot;",1435053892

There are a ton of different kinds of cartridge/pad/pod/foo systems, and again, it&#x27;s trivial to find third-party capsules.

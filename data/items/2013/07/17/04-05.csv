And they never waged war on large regions at a time. And let&#x27;s not forget their expansion was blessed by their own government.<p>Do you have any recent example of super-powerful corporation waging war around the world by themselves? Any example of corporation launching WW1 or WW2, or even something remotely big as the Vietnam war, all by themselves ?<p>It&#x27;s fairly obvious that no corporation nowadays has the financial means to wage war by themselves. It takes 100 billions to wage war in Iraq. Top tier companies make that much in REVENUE, not even profit. How would you expect them to spend so much? Your point does not make sense.",1374037153

Gittip is a nice initiative, in the &quot;thank you for developing this project&quot; kind of way - but I doubt anyone believes they can (or will be able to) pay the rent with donations paid through it. I wrote a post on this subject a couple of months ago, title &quot;Open-source can&#x27;t live on donations alone&quot; [1].<p>I also don&#x27;t subscribe to the notion that open-source should <i>only be about the love</i> - if companies like MySQL and Red Hat can make it into a huge business, and with the immense value open-source provides to the software industry, open-source developers should be treated as first-class citizens, not relegated to volunteer work late at nights, while doing their <i>real job</i> during the day.<p>Of course I&#x27;m biased, since I&#x27;m the founder of a company who&#x27;s making that change happen. We started Binpress [2] to help developers build profitable businesses like MySQL and Red Hat around their open-source code. We do it by providing them with a platform for adding a commercial layer over their open-source code (whether it&#x27;s self hosted or on GitHub, etc.), through commercial licensing and by providing customization, integration and support services.<p>We are a distribution marketplace, similar to the appstore or Steam but for open-source code products. We already have many developers making silicon-valley salaries working exclusively on their open-source projects - and we&#x27;re just getting started. We&#x27;ve been bootstrapped (and profitable) for 2 years but are now closing our seed (after going through the 500startup program).<p>If any of this makes sense to you, you are welcome to reach out to me at eran@binpress.com (I&#x27;m Eran, the CTO and co-founder).<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.binpress.com/blog/2013/04/14/open-source-cannot-live-on-donations-alone/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.binpress.com/blog/2013/04/14/open-source-cannot-l...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.binpress.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.binpress.com</a>",1374036704

If an ambulance following you turns on its lights to tell you to pull over, you&#x27;re compelled to do so -- it doesn&#x27;t mean you&#x27;re &quot;participating&quot; in a medical emergency.<p>3) You&#x27;re right that the NSA would like to slurp up data through as many means as it can. That doesn&#x27;t mean it is. Put another way, the fact that I would like to have Bill Gates&#x27; bank account does not mean I actually do.<p>If you possess actual evidence that Internet companies &quot;participate&quot; in PRISM, as opposed to being compelled by law and legal threats, and if you have evidence that the NSA has &quot;direct access&quot; to the Internet companies&#x27; servers, kindly share it.

There are a lot of lean times and challenges that test everyone&#x27;s mettle. I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s very likely someone can do their 9-5, even if they&#x27;re massively productive in that timespan, and not be looked at funny if the cultural norm is for everyone to work crazy hours. I think the way for reasonable hours to actually work at a startup is for the founders to actively make that the culture.<p><i>Unless</i> the company works asynchronously/remotely which has an awesome side-effect of making it feasible to value output over effort.",1374033943

I&#x27;ve heard of <i>lawyers</i> that specialize in defending animal rights activists get harassed incessantly by the police (e.g. getting pulled over, forced to sit there for 30 minutes as more police cars show up, then told they can go; no explanation as to why).<p>Also, look at all of the cases of police sending agent provocateurs into protest groups to encourage radical and/or violent behaviour.",1374033885

No. They&#x27;ve gone with the flow because they somehow agree that if the American public knows the law that governs them, we will all be killed in our beds by terrorists.<p>I have very little respect for people with the access and clout that Wyden and Udall have who fail to actually take any action outside their little box despite their probable understanding that this whole thing is undermining American democracy.<p>And that&#x27;s why I don&#x27;t feel bad about ascribing intent. Sure, they want to introduce mild reform without breaking any rules or expectations - but they want to keep their perky little jobs as opposed to taking an actual stand.<p>Why haven&#x27;t they proposed any legislation addressing the fact that our policymakers are sworn to secrecy so they can&#x27;t get a second opinion about the line they&#x27;re being fed? Why haven&#x27;t they brought any of this to the public for debate?  Because they actually think that - except for a few tweaks - it is a <i>good</i> thing for America to be run by secret bodies using secret policies and judged only by secret courts. They have acclimated to a two-tier system of justice, one for people with pull and another for you and me.",1374033802

Just today, we joined 18 other civil society groups in EFF&#x27;s lawsuit against the NSA&#x27;s surveillance of telephone call records; announced an event in San Francisco on reforming the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act to rein in this overly broad law with reforms such as proposed in &quot;Aaron&#x27;s Law&quot;; and endorsed reforms that would cut the red tape that prevents many of the schools and libraries that most need E-Rate funding from getting it.

Did you need to get market penetration to get them to listen to you, or did they never listen at all?  I&#x27;d love to be able to license our technology to a larger company instead of doing things the hard way.  Putting together a startup is not the easy way, although it seems to be easier than trying to navigate the inside of a large company to find the right person to be an internal champion for your product.<p>Basically, I&#x27;m asking, &quot;what does a successful wireless licensing path look like?&quot;.<p>My experience with trying to find the right decision-maker at large companies has been daunting.  I mean, I play soccer with about 10 engineers & managers from a large military radio company (rhymes with Paris) and not one of them could even point me to the right division to talk to, much less the correct decision-maker.  With companies where I don&#x27;t know anyone, I don&#x27;t even know where to start.<p>So, our startup is aiming to hit niche markets, like amateur radio, just to get a product out there and start some buzz.

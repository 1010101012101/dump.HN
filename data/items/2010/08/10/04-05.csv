It even includes a bit about different VMS filesystems, a neglected topic.<p>But I think this misses a lot of key points. You cannot compare operating systems without comparing a few key points:<p>1. What is a ""process"" (a.k.a ""task"", or ""job"") on this system?  In traditional Unix, a process was an address space, a thread of control (the schedulable unit, another key comparison point), a signal mask, a (set of) signal handler(s), a UID, and effective UID, a group ID, and a set of file descriptors, and maybe some other stuff like priority.  What's the equivalent in VMS?  Nobody ever charts that out.<p>2. What's the lifecycle of a program?  That's not the same as the lifecycle of a process in VMS, if I understand correctly.  Contrast and compare.  Extra points for complete explanation of starting a process (fork/exec vs CREATE$PROCESS or whatever VMS has).<p>3. What's the on-disk format of an executable file?  How does the OS decide if it can execute a file?  How does the OS decide to interpret a file (#!/usr/bin/env perl) or directly execute it?<p>4. How does a process do I/O?  Synchronous or asynch? Are different classes of devices treated differently?<p>5. Does a file have a ""type""?  What, precisely does the ""type"" mean?  On-disk format (fixed length records for example, or stream-of-bytes) or ""a document's owner""?",1281416131

1590486,comment,1588934,1590049,0,0,binspace,,,"> refusal to let private enterprise get on with making, doing, exporting, building<p>Agreed. However, blatant consumerism is causing massive global environmental damage. Industry & private enterprise should produce things that help society & the world, not pillage and destroy it.<p>Face it, the economy was on hyper-drive for too many years. We have for too long deferred paying our debts and missed making fundamental changes to our economy and society that would make our society (not just the environment) more sustainable.<p>Joblessness and a down economy would have happened with or without California regulations.<p>> The only way the energy problems are going to be solved is by letting free enterprise innovate and compete to a solution. Governments can't and shouldn't pick winners. Let any energy solution live and die on it's merits.<p>Exactly, that would be wonderful. Unfortunately the government has & still gives enormous subsidies to many environmentally (both sociologically and environmentally) damaging industries.<p>For example, why is food so cheap to mass produce in a centralized location and ship, so we can enjoy fattening and nutrient-starved meals at our local Micky D's? Government subsidies.<p>Why is oil so prevalent as our only energy source. Government subsidies of the auto industry. Let them go out of business so manufacturers make cars that people actually want.<p>Why is planned obsolescence such a mainstay in consumer goods, when more practical solutions exist? The all-mighty dollar has served as a Siren's song to the unchecked finance gambling machine.<p>Why do we have to spend billions of hours commuting, away from our families, when we can focus on making industries more localized and developing telecommuting technologies?<p>And how about the military as a vehicle of subsidization. Why are we fighting two wars based on false premises while pillaging social security?<p>Why is there a war on drugs? Subsidies.<p>I would rather have subsidies spent on encouraging more sustainable behavior, as the world population's resource usage is rapidly increasing. It just makes sense.",1281415759

Of course, we can all benefit as customers from cheaper books or more reliable vehicles and so forth; indeed, Walmart exemplifies the benefits of scale and modern supply chains in a way that substantially lowers the cost of living for a very large number of people. But it is not true that all of society benefits evenly when dull jobs are eliminated by automation.<p><i>Sure, those warehouse workers never get that job, but there are jobs at the robot makers, robot technicians, systems designers. The freeing up of this labour enables it to be deployed elsewhere, making everyones lives better.</i><p>See, if we had low unemployment and steady growth I'd agree, because industrial policy props up inefficient businesses and labor shortages drive up wages and act as a brake on growth. But what we have now is unusually high unemployment following a long period of wage stagnation, even though we had a period of record GDP growth at the same time. Between technology, outsourcing, and a shift towards services, it's not clear where less skilled labor <i>can</i> be efficiently deployed in the US at the moment. Youth unemployment is something like 40% because there's just not much demand for the inexperienced. One approach might be to abolish the minimum wage so that people could be busy doing <i>something</i>, even if only for $1/hour - but that's not a realistic policy, and would probably lead to riots.<p>It's no good being able to deploy your labor elsewhere if you lack skills that are in demand or the place demanding them is far away. Of course, you can up and move. I've done it myself, on several occasions - but I was young, free and single, and more importantly I had portable skills that were in high demand. The sad fact is that a lot of people aren't very entrepreneurial or smart - half the population is on the left side of the IQ distribution. A cheerful distribution and a good work ethic are important for anyone, but absent the skills most in demand, or the knowledge of what those even are, the opportunities are limited. We can easily come up with suggestions for a given individual but it's much harder to do across a population. And part of the reason for this is that neither government nor the economy as a whole operates like a business. We don't have the option of just firing 10 or 20% of the least productive citizens.<p>There's plenty of capital sitting unused in the private sector right now, but not enough new demand to invest it in new equipment or hiring. The ~30 million unemployed  and the bottom 50% of earners don't have enough money to do much shopping, so it's not going to come from them. Europe and Japan are in a similar situation. Where is the demand going to come from?",1281415256

But the general situation that the person who gets the final result <i>wins</i> very likely does inhibit effective work on the solution of very difficult problems.<p>I mean, I think there's a consensus that if Wiles had been publishing his results as he went along, Fermat would have been solved earlier but probably not by Wiles himself. Whether the current N/NP proof is right or not, it also is clearly the product of long work in a vacuum. That's not the best way to do things if nothing else as a matter of sanity. If you're publishing as you go along, you've got a lot more of a sanity check. Further, if research is open, you can do single person, small-committee and crowd-sourced versions.<p>Still, I don't think this primarily a matter of the Millennium Prizes in particular but of the tremendous competition of academia in general - Wiles' effort happened before the Millennium Prizes - and he couldn't get Fields Medal either - too old.<p>Oddly enough, the Netflix prize actually seems to have produced a fusion of efforts in the end.

1590428,comment,1586958,1586958,0,0,gensym,,,"This doesn't need to be hard or confusing. Let's start with the basics -<p>* It needs to be tasty and satisfying, or you won't stick with it. Don't start with some extreme diet: e.g. ""only raw food"", ""only stuff grown within 20 yards of your house"", ""No X where x is some macronutrient"".<p>* Set a goal of eating zero processed foods. If it comes in a box, don't eat it. If it comes in a can and it isn't just preserved, pure veggies (e.g., canned tomatoes) or fish (e.g., sardines), don't eat it. What can be done in a typical kitchen is about the max amount of processing you should regularly tolerate.<p>Very few will argue with the above points, unless they have some sort of agenda or ideology beyond just eating well. If that's all you do, you'll be eating more healthily than the vast majority of Americans. You'll probably feel better.<p>If you want to go further, you can:<p>* If you're going to eat animals, stick to animals that eat a diet for which they've evolved. i.e., prefer grass-fed beef to corn-fed.<p>* Prefer a variety of plants, and prefer plants that have been raised without chemical fertilizers or insecticides. We don't have enough data to know, but it seems likely that plants have evolved all sorts of chemicals to protect themselves from their environment that may also help protect us from their environment.<p>The theme of the above two points is- ""let's not fuck with the diet that kept humans alive since the development of agriculture and cooking. Let's let other poor saps be the experimental subjects""<p>I also prefer to do things whose benefits are less obvious, such as eating very little meat. That's likely healthy, but I do it more to be a decent neighbor.<p>That's my reasoning, and how I eat. Changing to eat that way  was surprisingly easy and enjoyable, and I no longer feel like I need to change my diet. I physically feel better: fewer headaches, better sleep, more energy, better ""digestion"". When I started eating that way, I dropped 10 pounds without trying (I wasn't overweight to begin with, and I'm not underweight now).<p>Here are the downsides - I expect them to apply to any reasonable diet:<p>* It's more expensive.<p>* It's more time-consuming. I cook more. I enjoy it, but it is less convenient.<p>* It's a challenge to not come across as a snob, especially when around less urban folks. I most frequently compromise on my diet when with family members.<p>* It's hard to eat that way outside of real cities. Produce at major supermarkets is frequently awful. Chain restaurants sell preprocessed garbage.",1281413622

This can be a real hassle for Mac users sharing work documents with PC users."" Excuse me, but you have to PAY for that Apple suite, just like you have to PAY for Microsoft Office on Mac. Does Microsoft mean to tell us that Office for Mac is a real hassle for Mac users to use in order to share documents with PC users? Well, now that you mention it, it is! They can't even keep their own office suites compatible, and I'm not talking OLE or VBA crap.<p>""If there's a Mac version of a program you need, you'll have to buy it again and relearn how to use it on a Mac.""

Don't waste your time with F2, or many other shortcuts that are changed for no apparent reason. Oh, and every time you launch a new Excel document, change your view from page-break view (with gaps for the margins!!!) back to the normal spreadsheet view that <i>almost every other spreadsheet in existence</i> starts with by default. Add a font to the OS? ""Optimizing font menu"" and add 30 seconds to the startup of either program.

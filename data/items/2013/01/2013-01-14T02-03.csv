Dopamine is a chemical that your brain secretes when you are trying to get something, not once you get it - so when you're hungry, for example, you'll have higher dopamine levels.  Then when you eat, they go back down. The actual sensation of higher dopamine levels is stress and anxiousness - it actually doesn't feel good at all.<p>Here's an NYT article talking about the common misconception: <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2009/10/27/science/27angier.html?_r=0"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nytimes.com/2009/10/27/science/27angier.html?_r=0</a><p>> they're addicted to the chemical sensations that their brain provides.<p>EVERY experience is a ""chemical sensation"" in the brain. Good.  Bad.  Whatever.<p>> In fact, now that I have learned about this, whenever I see a post on HN about how someone has lost their interest in programming or other activities, the first thing I think of is probably this person has a porn addiction.<p>What the fuck? This is the dumbest thing I've read in a while. There could be a million things that cause a loss of interest in programming.  Maybe they got girlfriends or started families? Maybe they suck at it, and just realized that?<p>It sounds like you used to be obsessed with porn, and now you're obsessed with ""porn addiction""",1358131958

It's hard to know which pieces of the syndrome are causes and which are effects.<p>But if you don't see anything broken with modern relationships, you aren't paying attention to the statistics. Since the 1960s things have certainly changed at a rapid rate and some of that change is clearly for the worse.",1358131933

It was definitely a cycle for me.  Alcoholics do not have to have a drink every day to be an alcoholic.  In fact, one of the points of the AA program that people need to learn is they are always an alcoholic.<p>In my experience, I would just feel an uncontrollable urge which would lead me to view porn.  Once I started, I would be in a trance-like state which is common from other experience I have read about.  What kind of really hit home is hearing a non-addict say something like he would view porn for 15-20 minutes and then it would get boring and he would stop.  That is the complete opposite of me, and other addicts.  Once we start, it becomes almost impossible to stop until we are completely ""drunk.""

(Eg. Building bridges or buildings.) In fact, in other disciplines it takes longer to build the final product than it does to design it, whereas with software, for most projects where the risk of wasting expensive resources is not involved, it's easier to write a prototype than to design your software up front. And yet the word ""engineer"" is used primarily to refer to a software developer, even though the term doesn't really fit the process of software development.<p>I can't help but feel that the word ""engineer"" is less of a descriptive and more like a title, such as ""writer"" in graffiti. [0]<p>""designer"" is interesting because it assumes that all design work is the same in all contexts. Software is special in regards to design, because it features graphic design challenges which are also industrial design challenges. So while a reader peering in from the outside might be confused by the ambiguous ""designer"", in reality the term is usually referring to interaction design.<p>This ambiguity gets especially interesting when you see the conversations that seem unaware of the difference between industrial and graphic design, leaving you guessing if the participants know or not.

I get paid to write, formulate, and conceptualize iOS Apps and how they connect with Android, our web services and designing the experience for the easiest use and most pleasurable use. I've never taken a CS class besides the one all undergraduates take (ala ""This is Word and Excel, today we're doing sums"").<p>All of this is besides the point, but hopefully it'll illustrate why I hate arguments from both sides of the fence about visual design vs engineering. Engineers tend to think visual designers can't possibly code/build like the engineers. Because they went to school and put in the time, that this knowledge is somehow inaccessible to designers - and that's the way it should be. Flip the coin over and you have very similar arguments. Designers tend to think engineers will never be able to realize aesthetics in their own work, to intuit the feeling certain colors and ratios of visual elements have with each other that leads to the ill-defined ""pleasure.""<p>Both are wrong, very very wrong. All of this knowledge is accessible to everyone - if you work towards it. A designer can learn to intuit which data structures are necessary to build this/that app, thinking about scalability to infinity while maintaining practicality in the small-scale, before writing a line of code, in the same way an engineer can learn WHY aspects of design are beautiful, and how this beauty is relative to the system (aka the painting, or all of the songs of an album) as a whole. These are trainable things. But you just gotta' get out of your comfort zone and preconceived notions about both design and engineering.",1358129209

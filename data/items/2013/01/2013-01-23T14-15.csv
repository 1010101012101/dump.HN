If you have more time, maybe link to a screenshot. Vague criticism alone is worthless though.<p>Personally I'd say that the font weights are far too low on much of the text. Thin text is in vogue and often looks great, but it's a bit overdone in this example. The phrase ""Address book storage you can trust"" at the top practically bleeds into its own red background. The sentence below is less readable still.

If something like this <i>did</i> appeal to them, it would take a lot of field trials and monitoring before it went out.  Remember that the corporation can specify certain equipment to produce their products, but in franchised stores those store owners need to do the actual purchase and maintenance of the equipment.

If they say ""this is the shake machine we recommend"", there will be two competing companies making that type of machine.  This is good business for a number of reasons.  So something like this mega robot would never make it to the field without a duplicate style of machine being made by someone else.<p>As far as this robot goes, it's just too complex and too critical to base an entire restaurant upon.

Doesn't matter if a technician is seated on a stool next to it 24 hours a day, you still can't guarantee when it will be running again.

It's really not all that difficult to parse, but it feels icky depending on how you view the scope of ""appropriate"" behavior in method argument definitions.<p>Like many viewpoints, the ""wrongness"" of this example is not black & white; it's shades of gray. On one hand, you have the ""anything that will eval is valid Ruby"" view, and on the other you have the ""If it's not immediately obvious to a beginner, you shouldn't do it"" view. There may be better ways to express those two sides of the matter, but that's the general idea.<p>The problem with this code (from the latter viewpoint) is that it crams too much program logic in to the argument definitions. This example uses parenthesis to force the evaluation of default_given = true; nil` in the argument definition list. That's only two statements, but it violates some common expectations:<p>A) We generally expect argument definitions to be clear and readable, so that method definitions are self documenting (to some degree); this approach clutters the argument definitions<p>B) We expect argument definitions to sometimes assign default values<p>C) We expect program logic to appear in the body of a method, or to be DRY'd up in separate methods<p>In this way, the example is not ""incorrect"" but awkward.

Here's the rub, if you want to go back because you feel like you have some gaps in your knowledge and want to fill them in, college can be great for that.

So focus on more theoretical stuff if you go.<p>Also, keep costs in mind. While you're at school your good salary means the opportunity cost is fairly steep.

5103100,comment,5098873,5099857,1,0,gench,,,"I dont think saying PhD is good or bad in general makes sense. It depends on what alternatives you have on your hands. If you are from a third world country and PhD is the only chance to take you a batter place, it makes sense. For the ones who already live in a decent country, it only makes sense if you are very very passionate about being an academician and you should carefully question the arguments making you passionate about that. I think doing PhD is much tougher now than 1983. There is a huge literature you gotta scan and there will be so many other people from both academia and industry working on similar topics so it is very difficult to make an original contribution that is satisfactory enough for the most.  Especially in engineering, hot topics having an application area are already studied by the high tech firms. One can work in one of those companies and still can do research, which can be more satisfactory since you can see it applied to the real life. Plus, you will have strict deadlines, much better salary and the time you spend there will be considered as a work experience when you make a new job application. So, in the end of the PhD, there is a risk of finding yourself where you started and asking yourself where you did wrong, especially if you didnt consider the after-PhD phase during the PhD (wrong topic and wrong supervisor choice, not  building connections, not doing an intern in a related company etc.) However, having a supportive supervisor with good connections can hack the game and put you some levels up.",1358951002

It seems to be extremely painful for the individual, and it's horrible for the people around that person. I don't classify people with occasional (but harmless) strange thoughts or paranormal beliefs as ""insane"". That's part of being human. Over a billion people believe that a virgin birth occurred over 2000 years ago. I personally think they're wrong, but I wouldn't call them insane or delusional. That belief, standing alone, is harmless.<p>I have no problem with people who choose to explore alternate states of consciousness, whether through meditation, brainwave entrainment, sensory deprivation, or psychedelics. I don't think they're ""insane"" for doing so. Most people who use LSD or psilocybin come out of the experience with no lasting harm. Albert Hoffman, who discovered LSD, used it into his 80s with no health problems. (He lived to be 102.)<p>However, if you spend significant time in a hipster enclave (e.g. Williamsburg) you see the long-term effects for people of certain mental patterns. The problem is that the people who are most attracted to frequent psychedelic use are also those, in my opinion, most vulnerable to the mental problems that this lifestyle can exacerbate.<p>Cocaine and alcohol are extremely dangerous, but everyone knows that. I think the danger of psychedelics (which are biologically non-toxic) is that they can appeal to an experience-chasing mentality, and that they sometimes become entwined with a pattern of self-medication for an existing mental problem that would be better treated by a real psychiatrist.<p>I've altered my consciousness a lot over the course of my life, and won't get into details (real name) but I haven't used any of these drugs for years. I don't even drink, except for an occasional beer with dinner. Drugs are not necessary. The way I think of it is that altered consciousness is like a wilderness. Meditation is like riding your bike into it, in the sense that if you're not in shape, you won't go very far but you'll be able to go back out. Keep riding, and you'll be able to go deeper over time. Psychedelics are more like hitch-hiking. You catch a ride, can go deep into the thick of it, and end up with no idea where you've landed. You hope you can find a safe ride back. Most of the time, you get a ride back and you're fine, but the probability of disaster is not zero.",1358950310

In a typical web application you usually get 3-5 things from the db, then you start rendering the templates. Each DB query waits for completion, then it starts the next which is a huge waste of time. In fact the system can easily start the parser and template renderer while the DB queries run and all the data will likely be available once it's accessed. This means you have <i>all</i> the benefits of synchronous processing with the majority of the advantages of async. The vast majority of web applications would likely very rarely block a thread in such an architecture.<p>I'm very surprised that not more languages implement this pattern.

Title is deceptive, it should have been labeled 'Deceptive Pricing Scam' or 'A need for better product reviews' and not 'E-commerce Scam'.  It's a blank statement with no meaning.  Almost every website in the electronic shopping sphere offers orders of magnitude better than the brick & mortar alternative, which is zero, with regard to reviews.  Additionally, this sort of price problem exists in both traditional retail and online shopping.  How is the problem specific to online shopping?<p>2.  Saying that Amazon returns 24,000 hits for Canon Digital Camera as a problem is like saying Google returns 12,400,000 for the same search (which it does).  Search is evolving in all areas, not just e-commerce.<p>3.  I'm going to assume that the statement 'no innovation has been made since the 90s' was in specific reference to product review/consumer option entitlement.  Leaps and bounds of improvement have been made to user interface, credit card security, guided navigation, payment options, search (believe it or not), scalability, advanced marketing, etc.",1259034678

It's an ideal opportunity to develop talent.<p>It's true that Sid probably doesn't fully understand his own approach, and even if he did, there's a junior designer would be able to absorb and adopt it all instantly. However, Sid would have some understanding, and the junior designer would be able to absorb and start adopting some of it; and simply having a kind and encouraging word from Sid would count for a lot.<p>If Sid didn't go to the trouble of doing this, or if the junior designer expected to be great without practice, it would indeed be demotivating.",1259033885

958657,comment,958627,958627,0,0,wmf,,,"Lots has been written about threads vs. events, although most of the debate concerns low-level software like Web servers, not Web apps. The supposed benefit of event-driven architecture is performance, but this may be reduced in the future by massive multi-core and Web apps already have such low performance that it's not clear that the benefit is worth it. Events can also reduce stack memory wastage (e.g. in Comet situations), although Go shows that memory-efficient threads are possible. Event-driven code is generally more verbose (due to ""manual stack ripping""; closures reduce this problem) and requires extra discipline because you can't ever call anything that blocks (like reading from a file). The recent trend in Web apps seems to be productivity over performance, which would seem to favor threads (note: not processes).",1259033744

958630,comment,957958,958546,0,0,Retric,,,"As I said ""Useful abstractions always have their limits"" you can represent any tree using the relational model.  The basic problem is recursive data structures need a higher level of abstraction.  Consider the following situation:<p><pre><code>  Bob is managed by Ted
  Ted is managed by Bob
</code></pre>
If that situation is allowed then all recursive queries need to deal with it.  On the other hand if it is NOT allowed then every commit needs to deal with it.  However, while the relational model does not understand those issues just like it does not understand HTML it still stores the data just fine.  Generally it's a fairly moot point because it's a program talking to the database and not a person, so that program can provide that level of abstraction just fine, granted it's less efficient than a model that understood the abstraction.<p>As to speed, Relational Databases are the x86 chips of the Database world.  There are plenty of custom system that are faster doing specific things, but they sacrifice speed for adaptability and backwards comparability.  For example: A core 2 chip's instruction decoder and an SQL databases query optimizer do basically the same thing.  With a custom solution you can just skip that step and directly say what to do, but the abstraction is normally worth it so you can upgrade the hardware for years without changing the program.<p>So the relational model makes the basic assumption that speed is not the primary concern or you would be writing at a more basic level, yet people want more speed so there are plenty of real world hacks to help things along like CONNECT BY and <i>stored procedures</i>, and all those new x86 instructions.  So, 99.9% of the time in the real world an of the shelf database running on an x86 chip is plenty fast if used correctly and it's also fairly cheap compared to the total costs of the other solutions.",1259032679

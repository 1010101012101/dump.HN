210544,story,,,2,3,edb,"Ask YC: IDE debugging for web programming - a dream or a reality?",,"So I've done a lot of java + eclipse and C++ + Visual Studio (that + looks awkward..) development in my life and find that the debugging IDE tools in eclipse/VS were absolutely key to my adoption and performance in using those languages. Most importantly, I like that they allow you to step into and out of function calls, view the call stack and variable values real-time at any line of code as the code progresses. This was a key learning tool for me.<p>Has anybody successfully done this in with any web programming languages + frameworks? I'm a cakePHP developer, for example, and I'd like to see the sequence of calls from the time the dispatcher is instantiated to the time that the views are echo'd and sent to the browser.<p>Just curious if anybody has done this successfully in PHP, Symfony, CakePHP, Ruby, Rails, Python, Django, whatever it may be... I've been doing web development for a few years now and have resorted to elaborate print statements and variable dumps for my debugging needs, I need more!<p>If you've lived the debugging dream, or have any debugging tips to offer, please post the tools you've used and any resources you may know of to help me (and our readers) set it up.<p>I've recently installed Eclipse PDT with Zend Debugger in an attempt to do this and had luck in simple scripts with include statements, but once mod_rewrite gets involved, everything goes straight to hell.<p>I'm curious if I should keep trying or if it's nothing but a dream...",1212717558
210542,comment,210197,210197,0,0,etal,,,"I would have used it. I used to ride with a van pool. Links:<p><a href=""http://www.vanpool.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.vanpool.com/</a> (sponsored by Enterprise rent-a-car)<p><a href=""http://www.vanpoolusa.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.vanpoolusa.com/</a> (sponsored by VPSI Inc.)<p>This was in Southern California, where public transportation has been endangered or extinct for decades. The arrangement sucked, and my current commute sucks enough that I'd carpool again if the meetup time wasn't 5:45 a.m.<p>Edit: I poked at it a little, and noticed that it doesn't ask for a radius when saving a new commute (no matches). Is the matching algorithm fuzzy enough to figure out when I'm ""close enough"" to someone else's route? Does it match along the whole route, so I could pick someone up midway?",1212717420

210540,comment,209955,210141,0,0,etal,,,"I was thinking about that the other day -- it's an anti-inflammatory drug that seems to work immediately on many patients diagnosed with Alzheimer's. Why?<p>Apparently it's difficult to tell the difference between Alzheimer's and vascular dementia while the patient is still alive -- examining a sample of brain tissue is the definitive test. I think I heard that the misdiagnosis rate is something like 50% (unreliable number, don't take my word for it). It doesn't make much sense for an anti-inflammatory drug to clear the protein plaques or undo neurological damage in the case of Alzheimer's disease, but it does make sense for the drug to improve blood flow to the brain for patients who actually have vascular dementia instead. So, perhaps there was a mix of patients in the (small) initial trials we've seen for etanercept as an Alzheimer's treatment that accounts for the surprising result.",1212716881

210535,comment,210484,210484,0,0,cconstantine,,,"The main problem I've had has been distribution.  To distribute a lisp program I need to either:<p>1) Create an executable image that is HUGE, even for small/simple applications<p>2) Distribute a loadable image and force the users to make sure it's version matches their runtime (if they even have one, which isn't likely).<p>Perhaps there is a third option... and if there is I'd love to hear it.  But if you can't distribute the program, whats the point in writing it?",1212715977

I just assumed because of the connection to Engine Yard, and you know what happens when one assumes.<p>""We will be releasing the whole thing open source once we have locked down the protocol and made it a XEP standard, so keep an eye on my blog if you are interested.""<p>Will do.  While we have our own implementation for solving quite a few of the common cloud infrastructure problems, we're also agnostic and configure dozens of other tools without feeling the least bit guilty about having multiple ways to do things (must be our Perlmonger background), and it sounds like you're addressing things that aren't in our current scope.  (For example, we support Xen, VServers, Zones, and EC2, and S3 and ZFS...we're loco like that.  We don't even care.)",1212715257

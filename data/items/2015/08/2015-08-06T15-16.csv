10017359,comment,10016910,10016910,0,0,birken,,,"I imagine there is going to be a lot of negativity in the comments, but I applaud you for not only solving a bunch of problems, but posting your code.<p>However, when sharing code that others might use, there are some basic recommendations that I think would help here.  They aren&#x27;t entirely about correctness, though some of them are.<p>1) Consistent style (function naming style, indent style, are these functions or not, etc).  It is confusing for your end users if some of your functions look_like_this, whereas other ones lookLikeThis.  Granted, PHP itself has a bunch of problems with this, but since you can easily control this, it is a nice thing to do.  Same goes for the code itself and how it is indented, how brackets are used, etc.<p>2) No commented out lines of code.  If there is an option for a particular feature in a function, it should be a $parameter in the function.  Your users shouldn&#x27;t have to comment and uncomment code to enable things.  Comments written in english explaining code are of course fine.<p>3) All options should be $parameters.  For example in #13, the $dir variable which affects the output filename is just hard-coded.  This is an important value and should be a $parameter for the function.  In #18, the reply-to and return-path should be $parameters.  When you are writing functions for yourself, it is perfectly functional to hard-code these things (though not necessarily recommended).  But if you are sharing it, you need to write for the most general case, so everybody can easily use parameters for their own specifics.<p>4) Simplest possible code.  For example in #9, this function could just be the return statement and it would do the same thing.  When writing for other people, every extra line of code is extra work for people to understand.  If it can be written in a simpler way (that is also easy to understand), than it should be.<p>5) Be aware when using APIs.  Quite a few of these examples use external APIs.  I&#x27;d put those in a separate section, because they have external dependencies (internet connection, access keys, etc) that put them in a different class as compared to pure PHP solutions.  A person using your code might not be aware of this and it could create problems for them.",1438876744
10017358,comment,10013434,10014223,0,0,soylentcola,,,"The selection used to bother me until I realized it was due to treating it as a replacement for a video rental store.  Makes sense since the original DVD-by-mail service aimed to compete in that space.<p>But now I treat it more like a really cheap version of cable TV.  With cable, I can turn it on at any given time and channel surf until I find something I wouldn&#x27;t mind watching.  The specific movie or show I want to see probably won&#x27;t be on but sometimes it is and the rest of the time, I&#x27;d just flip until I found something interesting.<p>The thing is, just a basic cable package for casual browsing and watching shows costs at least like $30-50/mo and often more.  Netflix is what, $10/mo?  As a replacement for &quot;all the random channels&quot; I find it to be quite good.  I usually have a better time finding something I&#x27;d enjoy watching compared to basic cable and it costs a good deal less.  For the occasional movie or newer show, there are online purchases, rentals, and more &quot;premium&quot; services like HBO Now.  Just like cable TV, you pay extra for the new stuff.<p>The only thing about the new Netflix website that bums me out is that it broke the &quot;God Mode&quot; bookmarklet that I always used.  It got rid of the endless horizontal scrolling and showed several rows of titles for each category, making for much easier and faster browsing.",1438876723

10017355,comment,10014794,10016406,0,0,cdr,,,"The biggest thing I&#x27;ve seen that Skylake provides for high-performance gaming is 26 PCIE lanes.<p>This means you can run a PCIE 3.0 4x+ lane NVMe SSD like the Intel 750 while also running a 3.0 16x GPU (or two GPUs in SLI/CrossFireX). Given an appropriate board, anyway - I haven&#x27;t looked at Skylake boards.<p>The performance increase of PCIE NVMe SSDs over SATA SSDs is amazing. SSDs are already great of course, but the Intel 750 can decrease load times by another order of magnitude.<p>Looking at the linked motherboard, its PCIE 3.0 slots are shared bandwidth, which isn&#x27;t taking advantage of Skylake at all.<p>Edit: Actually, looking at the launch boards in Anandtech&#x27;s review, most of them are routing the extra PCIE 3.0 lanes to M.2 ports (potentially a step backwards from U.2 but forwards from SATA). Getting maximum performance out of a NVMe SSD is seemingly still going to be restricted to only certain high-end boards for the time being.<p>At a glance, it looks like the &quot;MSI Z170A Gaming M9 ACK&quot; board has a dedicated 3.0 x4 slot separate and supports U.2, so there&#x27;s at least some available, but it&#x27;s $400.<p>Edit2: Apparently Skylake M.2 slots can provide full 3.0 x4 performance, so they&#x27;re probably fine.",1438876707

Netflix makes up a lot of that on increased marketshare, but still, I&#x27;m not sure they can afford to generate a lot of content.<p>>People are wanting to get away from cable, not find a way to recreate it.<p>But it&#x27;s totally unreasonable to believe you&#x27;ll get the same content as cable at a steep reduction in price. Sure you can take away cable profits and delivery expense, but you have to add in Netflix profit and delivery expense. It&#x27;ll be cheaper, but not by a lot. Unless Netflix increases the subscriber base, but cable and networks already had a massive marketshare.<p>The value Netflix provides on 8 dollars is miraculous. But most of that pricing is hinged on netflix being a rerun service. Studios sell them stuff that is old and will never run on TV again. Netflix is sort of a parasite on cable and the movie industry.<p>If netflix actually kills cable and broadcast TV, then who is going to make all the shows for it?<p>As netflix becomes the normal way to consume media the expense of the content is going to shoot up. Because media is priced based on price discrimination. If netflix becomes the premium market, it&#x27;ll have to pay premium prices.",1438876696

My gripe with go was that it was a clean-slate, modern language that didn&#x27;t adopt any of the awesome things PL community invented since the 80&#x27;s.<p>Julia seems to be the best example of a clean-slate language that tries to combine all the best features and attributes of various languages with good effect. Also beats Go and many other languages on various benchmarks despite dynamic typing. I&#x27;d like to see some application-server or RDBMS type of benchmarks, though, as Julia was designed for the mathematical stuff.

It&#x27;s a matter of applying business concepts of productivity to the healthcare setting.<p>Ex: In business, if Joe the factory worker can make 100 widgets in an hour, and Mike can make 150 in an hour, with the same number of defects, Mike is more productive than Joe.<p>So now let&#x27;s apply this to the ED: If Joe the nurse can discharge or admit 10 patients in an hour, and Mike can admit or discharge 15 in an hour, Mike is more productive, right?  Well, no, because maybe Mike had patients that were triaged as low priority, but Joe was working Level 1 trauma side.  Or you have patients presenting with the same things, but one is a healthy 30 year old and another is 80-something with multiple comorbidities.<p>I&#x27;ve seen Baumol&#x27;s Cost Disease used to explain why we see the healthcare industry grappling with rapidly increasing costs, especially wage costs: because we can&#x27;t measure productivity.  I&#x27;d argue, from what I&#x27;ve seen, that in fact, that&#x27;s not true.  I even came up with a formula to measure nursing staff productivity relative to patient acuity levels, but never had any buyers.  Why?  You start getting into questions about actual patients that no one wants to answer, because they&#x27;re uncomfortable ethical questions, and reimbursements will drop regardless of the answers.<p>Being treated effectively at this point is being treated as a human, and either bringing the disease under control, or getting rid of the disease.  We need to undersand that although these healthcare workers are in caring professions, their work is being increasingly shifted from what we all think effective treatement should be, to what the business thinks effective treatment should be (read: profitable).<p>You do accept this kind of rushing in other industries, because you believe in productivity.  And that&#x27;s fine.  It&#x27;s also fine to believe in productivity in healthcare (I do), but not in the patients/hour concept.  As a country, we need to change this model.

Of these filings, one didn&#x27;t even require anaesthetic for her to drill and complete the filling.<p>After this dentist left, the next had a policy of, if it isn&#x27;t causing you pain, filling it is unnecessary (because you often have to drill a tooth slightly to fill it, damaging the tooth worse).<p>That dentist eventually moved on, and two of those earlier fillings fell out within a month of each other (really not a good time having to carefully eat around these teeth, one on each side of my mouth), and the new dentist gave me two root canals because the roots in the affected teeth had apparently died (potentially my fault, for delaying an appointment due to the timing being several weeks before I was to leave uni). Several months after these root canals had been completed, I had an abscess on one of these teeth, but it passed after a weekend of paracetamol(?). One of these root canal&#x27;d teeth then further broke, and the dentist recommended having a crown placed on the tooth, I did enquire about simply having the tooth removed because it had become so much hassle, but the dentist was really against it.<p>Due to my situation of being at university, and having to travel several hours down the country for each dental appointment, and the need for 4+ appointments to have 2 crowns I opted to visit a dentist local to my university. They ended up recommending removing both the root canal&#x27;d teeth (one specifically because the tooth had broken below the gum-line, so it should not be crowned/filled) and they also applied dental sealant to an unrelated tooth. This dentist also stated, if you have an abscess on a root canal&#x27;d tooth, that it has become infected, and that infection is unlikely to ever go away, it will simply come back when your immune system is weak (at the initial abscess I had been doing a 48 hr all-nighter for a large assignment deadline), so it&#x27;s best to have these teeth removed.<p>tldr; Dentists in my own anecdotal experience can have vastly different opinions of best practise.<p>I&#x27;m also UK based, so dental treatment is relatively inexpensive, due to the NHS funding a large part of it.",1438875417

Meanwhile the &quot;good stuff&quot; is priced much higher than it should be. For example, multilevel cell technology only multiplicatively increases capacity, but exponentially decreases endurance and retention. This fact seems seldom-mentioned. 16Gbit SLC and 32Gbit 4-level (2-bit) MLC made on the same process should be the same area and price, but as of this post DRAMExchange says the SLC costs over 4x more.<p>I know ECC and advanced wear-leveling can help, but all this adds extra complexity to the system and introduces more points of failure (see all the SSD firmware problems for example.)",1438875384

You&#x27;ll bring up the average quality of current employees, but have to backfill the missing employees.<p>If your hiring is just a normal distribution on average skill, the result is that you quickly reach diminishing returns.  You fire the vast majority of your new hires every year, while slowly turning over a few of the old ones in favor of new superstars.  If your hiring is better than average, though, you can reach far high equilibrium points.  In effect, it makes sense to fire all the employees up to your hiring midpoint, trusting that you can efficiently raise your average quality by doing so.  After that, you&#x27;ll have to cycle through too many employees per position to see speedy improvement.<p>Of course, all of this is crippled by training delays and the problems you&#x27;ll face when &quot;we fired half the employees last year&quot; gets around.

It would be even better if such study could conclude if such correlation is strong enough to justify calling &quot;increase of A&quot; a driving factor in the &quot;increase of B&quot; or not.<p>* On the other hand, it is a logical fallacy to claim that no conclusion can be reached regarding the causation/correlation between increases of A and B without &quot;backing it up with facts&quot;.

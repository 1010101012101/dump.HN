Their focus will be business class computers, workstations, and servers.<p>If it were just the end of the consumer market, then Intel and MS should be concerned, but at least they could take comfort in the fact that they still dominate the enterprise space. The issue is that their dominance in the enterprise space is eroding as well. For Intel, a central issue is the ascension of ARM. Smooth-Stone (a well funded startup), Dell, and NVIDIA (see Project Denver), as well as others, are now prototyping ARM-based servers for datacenters. A related issue is that Intel's latest processors now overshoot the performance needs of a majority of customers. Meanwhile, Microsoft's enterprise business is eroding due to several trends, such as cloud services (e.g., Gmail) and cloud computing (e.g., PaaS and IaaS). And both companies have to overcome some reputational issues stemming from their historical power in the PC space through the Wintel standard.<p>Intel and Microsoft have tremendous resources to respond to these threats, but the clock is ticking.",1297302817

In Twitter-sized chunks. That is why Twitter is so popular. But you can compose a Tweet on a touchscreen keyboard. I'm sure that's especially true if you have been to middle school in this century and have lived the life of the text messager.<p>But that's just part of the answer. The real answer is that the PC isn't going anywhere. But that's not enough to make an ""era"". As Bruce Sterling once said: We very likely have better flint-knife technology today than they did in the flint era, if only because the flint-knapping enthusiasts can swap secrets on the net and share a global collection of books, videos, and meetups. But that doesn't mean we are in any kind of ""flint era"". We have more paper and more pens available today than ever in history, but we don't speak of the pen-and-paper era. And there is more rock music being played today than in 1968 and yet we think of then, not now, as more of a ""rock era"".<p>An ""era"" is defined by newness, disruption, and the smell of profit. The modern PC platforms are between fifteen and twenty-five years old and have changed little in the last decade. Major parts of the industry have seen their margins shrink to near zero. Others are profitable but only for a tiny handful of big players. This doesn't mean history is over - I refuse to believe that, say, Adobe Photoshop circa 2011 is the last word in image editing for the next hundred years - but to change the PC market from within is a long hard slog. The build-out of mobile will be a lot more fun to watch.",1297302534

That means Nokia would have a special status with Windows Phone 7.<p>Would the other hardware vendors Microsoft has been working with be kicked out, leaving WP7 to run only on Nokia hardware? I find it hard to think of any other 'special status' Nokia can have, if other vendors also offer WP7 phones. Or would other vendors be forced to offer ones with severe limitations, to differentiate Nokia's? If so it seems to not make sense for the other vendors.<p>Also not sure why it makes sense for Microsoft. Giving Nokia special status means limiting the amount of hardware vendors. Perhaps Microsoft just wants to do the iPhone thing - tightly integrated software+hardware - but they could have done that in-house, like the did with Zune. Why have a single hardware vendor that isn't themselves?<p>For Nokia, I can see how this might make sense - they have had lots of delays while developing their software platform, and Microsoft has a viable one now. However, it seems it would make much more sense for Nokia to just fork Android, which is also a viable platform, and a more popular one at that. Also, it is free of cost, unlike WP7.<p>So overall this is very odd, but I guess the details will come out soon, and maybe it will make more sense.",1297302018

I'm an übergeek; she's a technically competent teacher. Computers are merely tools to her.<p>We went to Italy this past summer. We took my iPhone (data turned off), an iPad 3G, my SLR, and her camera. Because I couldn't find someone locally to sell me a photo tank, I also had to take an Airport Express, a netbook, and a card reader to save the pictures I took (I didn't have the camera connection kit at the time). Except for that, we did not use a laptop. We used the iPad extensively in Italy, paying our bills, making calls on a SIP client, browsing the web, writing blog posts, and even uploading edited photos to a photoblog at <a href=""http://aureolastatua.tumblr.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://aureolastatua.tumblr.com</a>. We didn't once feel like we were missing out on anything or that we needed to go to an Internet cafe. The portability was astounding. We needed a laptop in 2006 when we went to Europe to do much the same.<p>The second anecdote is current. When I get home, I rarely get on the single ""real"" computer unless I'm programming. When my wife is doing report cards, I <i>can't</i> get on until shortly before bedtime. In years past, I would have quickly been annoyed by this and gotten a laptop by now. I don't need it for my evening browsing—because of the iPhone and iPad.<p>The PC isn't going away, but it's not going to be the main screen soon. That screen won't be the iPad 1, either.

You technically don't even need a real corporation until much later in the process than you would expect (I have friends who run successful businesses as sole proprietorships).<p>As for what you can do now, IANAL, but having been in a similar situation myself (startup died and I was left with a C-Corp), you have a bunch of options. You can dissolve it right now, or hold on to it for a while to see if something else takes off. There's a certain minimum amount that having a company will cost you in taxes and fees (about a grand a year if you're in CA, and likely less if you're elsewhere). For a Delaware Corp that's actually elsewhere, you need to pay for a registered agent, which is like $200 a year. You need to file some report and pay some tax to Delaware as well, but the time/money involved with that requirement is pretty minimal.<p>If you want to dissolve it yourself, it isn't that hard. There are a bunch of forms you need to fill out, but it isn't all that difficult to do so (you can find them online).

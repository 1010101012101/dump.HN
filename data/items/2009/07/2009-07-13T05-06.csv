701168,comment,700999,701129,0,0,michaelkeenan,,,"> no psychologist would argue most 14 year olds have fully developed understanding of consequences (much less, empathy) at that age.<p>Robert Epstein is a psychologist who argues that teens are/can be as competent as adults:<p>""Dumas and I worked out what makes an adult an adult. We came up with 14 areas of competency—such as interpersonal skills, handling responsibility, leadership—and administered tests to adults and teens in several cities around the country. We found that teens were as competent or nearly as competent as adults in all 14 areas. But when adults estimate how teens will score, their estimates are dramatically below what the teens actually score.<p>...<p>Studies show that we reach the highest levels of moral reasoning while we're still in our teens. Those capabilities parallel higher-order cognitive reasoning abilities, which peak fairly early. Across the board, teens are far more capable than we think they are.""<p>From <a href=""http://www.psychologytoday.com/articles/200703/trashing-teens"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.psychologytoday.com/articles/200703/trashing-teen...</a>",1247464235

I do plan to make a simplified version eventually but for now I'm still adding features and trying to document the most recent ones.<p>For now there's video tutorials there that guide through the basics of using the ear trainer and further instructions on the help page. There's a few things that are counter intuitive but are far more efficient that way. For example when you click the wrong answer the correct associated song starts playing. Clicking star wars and having it play here comes the bride might seem confusing but it's necessary for improving the song associating with the correct interval. Also automatically playing a new interval when you're correct is confusing at first but the more clicks saved the more efficient training can be.<p>I can't guarantee anything if they don't watch the tutorial or read the help page for now. Making it beginner foolproof would be great but not if older users have to make 5 - 10 clicks when starting up to get it back to the most efficient settings. I tried a version with elements hidden but in the end it's better just make another version and call the current one the 'advanced version'. The song buttons are packed because they're dynamic in length. The songs can be named anything in the song editor. Also if you select all chords or scales in the first dropdown it already overflows the expected area. There can be a lot of answer choices.<p>Thanks again for the detailed comment, It'll try and reciprocate my time if I notice somewhere I can or if you tell me something you want feedback on.",1247464234

The same goes for 14 year olds and they sometimes consistently make calls that seem ridiculous to older people. That it seems ridiculous to <i>you</i> doesn't make it ridiculous to <i>some 14 year olds</i>.<p>Your examples both fail to take into account that say 10% of youngsters may not act like <i>you</i> would expect them to.

You can repeat how stupid something is until you throat goes soar: that doesn't mean the person under discussion was capable of understanding that.<p>I think you should read up on your developmental psychology: the ethical calls of 8 or 14 year olds tend to be pretty different from those of adults. Especially the regular outliers are fascinating.<p>A kid with a knack for electrical engineering... hmmm, might he just be a little behind in his understanding of social phenomena? Of the value we adhere to other people's wellbeing?<p>I still have the capacity to reason about things without any concern for the people involved. People ask: how can you even consider that, given the consequences to the people involved. The seem paralized to even consider some options, as they immediately think it would be bad for humans. My answer: like any other factor, you can perfectly exclude 'people' for simplicity, to take that factor into account later. Sometimes that make the previous exercize a waste; sometimes it brings a valuable perspective, because the cost to humans turns out to be avoidable in some way. Think 'nuclear energy' in the 80's. Many people were incapable of any sound reasoning about that, because of perceived costs to human lives.<p>Perhaps only one person should have said to this boy ""ehmm, do you realize how dangerous this is?

701151,comment,700999,701129,0,0,imajes,,,"IANAL, however-<p><i>The age of reason- The age at which a child is considered capable of acting responsibly.</i><p><i>Under Common Law, seven was the age of reason. Children under the age of seven were conclusively presumed incapable of committing a crime because they did not possess the reasoning ability to understand that their conduct violated the standards of acceptable community behavior. Those between the ages of seven and fourteen were presumed incapable of committing a crime, but this presumption could be overcome by evidence, such as the child having possession of the gun immediately after the shooting. The rebuttable presumption for this age group was based on the assumption that, as the child grew older, he or she learned to differentiate between right and wrong. A child over the age of fourteen was considered to be fully responsible for his or her actions. Many states have modified the age of criminal responsibility by statute.</i><p><i>All states have enacted legislation creating juvenile courts to handle the adjudication of young persons, usually under eighteen, for criminal conduct rather than have them face criminal prosecution as an adult. However, a child of thirteen who commits a violent crime may be tried as an adult in many jurisdictions.</i><p>-- West's Encyclopedia of American Law, edition 2. Copyright 2008 The Gale Group, Inc. All rights reserved. (from <a href=""http://legal-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/Age+of+Reason"" rel=""nofollow"">http://legal-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/Age+of+Reason</a>)<p>Now, it'll be easy enough for anyone to argue that the teen is responsible given the typical age of reason argument. Defence might argue that he has social development issues and therefore is emotionally younger. Prosecution may argue that given he researched, developed and then executed his 'attack', the level of premeditation and appropriate amount of time taken to complete would show presumptive responsibility.<p>In other words, dude. wth?<p>Yes, the engineers built a cheap system however many years ago (i'd say decades). They didn't have any idea of what they needed to do for security. And for what it's worth, it'd be pretty easy to hack SF's Muni - there are plenty of spots where all you need is a welding torch and a crow bar to cause damage and risk lives.<p>But the reality is, the kid did something wrong and will find it pretty hard to argue that he's not responsible. Hopefully however, the judge will have the foresight to set a sunset clause on his sentence which will expunge it from his record when he turns into an adult -- or the hope of him ever getting a visa to come and hack out here will be pretty slim. :)",1247463100

701146,comment,700999,701129,0,0,cduan,,,"A lot of HN readers appear to place the blame on the system engineers rather than the kid. Some go so far as to say that the kid did a good thing in teaching the engineers a lesson. The implicit principle seems to be that unwanted intrusions are acceptable--even applaudable--actions in the face of systems unsecured against them.<p>I would ask of you whether you would apply this principle in other systems. Shall we call it a ""good lesson"" if the kid went around shooting people in the train, as a lesson that the trains need to be bulletproofed?<p>Folks, the criminal law exists to punish certain undesirable actions, so that the general public can save itself the cost of self-protection. I don't walk around wearing a bulletproof vest all the time, because I believe that the law and its enforcement will sufficiently deter others from deciding to intrude upon my body with a bullet.<p>So should it be with technological intrusions as well as physical. Certainly it is feasible to build secure systems. So is it feasible for me to wear a bulletproof vest all the time. But secure systems, like bulletproof vests, are costly things--they require hiring good engineers, spending time to evaluate security risks, testing systems for robustness, and so on. And if these costs are sufficiently high, then it would be economically inefficient to impose them on systems engineers by allowing hacking like this to go unpunished.<p>I'm not saying that anyone should be lax in building secure systems. I am, however, saying that intrusive behavior like this kid's should not be applauded. It should be recognized for what it is: a societally detrimental act, for which he should be held accountable as any other societally detrimental act is held under the law.",1247462774

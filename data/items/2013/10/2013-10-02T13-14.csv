Its not just his $100K/700 hours = pretty good, its also his customers thinking, hmm, it took a specialist 700 hours, so it going to take our busy guys 1000 hours part time, and our guys are already busy, and he&#x27;s only asking $500, thats a bargain at 50 cents per hour to replicate...<p>Now if you start demanding $5/hr from each customer then the outsources in India are going to start eating into your sales when they take the work inside or just figure out a work around that doesn&#x27;t take 1000 or 700 hours.<p>Another interesting issue is signing budgets.  I have no use for this particular example but my boss can sign off on $500 at pretty much any mega corp I&#x27;ve worked at, but if you demand annual auto-renewal ongoing charges or get into the mid 4 figures suddenly you have to convince a heck of a lot more people than me and my boss.  If you&#x27;re charging more than a conference or a training class, or you&#x27;re demanding annual payment, its going to be a harder sell for megacorps.  Sure the code monkey and his boss might love it, but now you need to convince additional bean counters who think ruby is a precious stone and its all downhill from there.  You could try to corporate speak market it to get past the bean counters with lots of babble about proactively leveraging the synergy of the enterprise cloud platform but that risks repelling the code monkey and his boss, a fine line to walk.",1380722355

I&#x27;ve done WP and Drupal briefly before doing Rails, basically all the time. But since then I&#x27;ve also built things in Sinatra and JS frameworks, too.<p>For awhile, I didn&#x27;t touch Rails but went back to it and was pleasantly surprised that even though I enjoyed using Sinatra and Padrino, the weight that Rails&#x27;s magic adds is counter-balanced by convenience that is most welcome to developers.<p>I contrast this with Drupal/Wordpress, in which the version upgrades make the platforms easier to build out for clients, but not much easier to develop for, in terms of either developing plugins or customizing the install (not sure with Drupal, I quit at around v5).<p>To me, it seems like Rails is adding some things I may never use, but those things seem to be optional...And from 3 to 4,  they did cut back on some magic-hacks, such as the magic-finders that were too susceptible to security flaws.<p>I think a big part of why Rails may have better longevity than previous uber-platforms is because of its focus on testing.

But if you use a port sewquence derived from a S/KEY, then each port knock sequence is a one time sequence never to be repeated.<p>It is a simple and dirty level of security using the much hated obscurity approach, but by varying the ports via a aranged S/KEY sequence you can move it up a whole level.  S/KEY easy to do and worked well on old old old nokia over 10 years ago as a little simple java app.  Just using it to derive a port sequence instead of a one time password.",1380722108

So for example, alt + ] snaps the window to the right half of the screen. The same shortcut again grows the window to 90% wide, then 80%, then 60%, and finally back to 50%. So if I want whatever I&#x27;m reading to be decently wide at the cost of letting my SSH window take up slightly less than half the screen, I can make that happen without a mouse. Or for a good responsive site, 20% or 30% of my screen is all the site needs.<p>In addition, when I have two windows each taking up 50%, hovering on the window edges they share them brings up an additional handle that lets me adjust the width of both windows simultaneously (if I want).

It is opinionated, and has tools like railsapps that let you customize it.  So you can have a solution that includes bootstrap, authentication, stripe-payments, etc., almost completely out of the box.<p>2) Rails will continue to be plagued with the problems (security, slow dynamic language) etc. but it will always have workarounds like jruby, celluloid, rails-api, in-memory-models (I wish this was more common).  The community is vibrant enough to keep plugging along and fixing the gaps.<p>3) I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s a coincidence that the two most influential frameworks (Rails and Sinatra) were written in Ruby.<p>4) Eventually people&#x27;s MVP will move to something like Scala, following the example of Twitter and LinkedIn.  Static languages that encourage functional behavior improve speed and safety.<p>5) Play is interesting.  I am checking it out now, and seeing how I can move a rails app to it.<p>6) Node serves the lowest-common-denominator in my opinion (it caters to non-polyglots).  I use it for certain things (a workflow for prototyping phonegap apps, and client-side tooling) but I personally think it is way overhyped.  However it definitely has a place, and will continue to have one.<p>7) If Rails does someday &quot;die&quot; that&#x27;s okay for dhh&#x27;s legacy.

The real question is whether or not the things that Rails does best will continue to be important in the marketplace.<p>We&#x27;ve already seen parts of Rails&#x27;s core competencies carved out by other tools: Erlang/Node/Go enable saner async programming.  Backbone/Angular/Ember enable rich web applications.  Scala/Clojure/Go/etc. on the &quot;fast compiled backend services&quot; front.  Even PHP is keeping pace with the times (Composer, Laravel) just enough to keep its adherents from having a real reason to jump ship.<p>Ruby and Rails are still pretty much as good as it gets for rapid development of web applications (the backend parts of MVC, anyway), and there&#x27;s a growing Ruby niche for configuration management (Chef, Puppet, etc).<p>Personally I find my investment in learning and working with Ruby has been a great way for me to experience a much wider variety of technologies and architectures than I would have otherwise.  Thanks to Rails work I&#x27;ve learned tons about AMQP, Postgres, Chef, Backbone, JavaScript, CSS, Ansible, DNS (bind), and more that I just wouldn&#x27;t have had the same exposure to in a slower-paced development environment.<p>Your ending line about &quot;still in wide use but not frequently selected for the best new projects&quot; is a bit complicated.  Certainly any language stays in wide use once it falls out of fashion and its projects categorically move to the &quot;legacy&quot; phase, but &quot;best new projects&quot; is a bit much.  A lot of what we might think of as the &#x27;best&#x27; projects are driven by fashion just as much as technical merits.",1380720751

While it&#x27;s becoming obvious that the basic design of Django creates serious problems when moving away from the request/response cycle, it&#x27;s a very hard problem to fix if you can&#x27;t fundamentally change core assumptions within the framework. Second, Python 3 (sans Tulip) just isn&#x27;t up to snuff for asynchronous coding. Twisted is a mess, Tornado is far too simple.<p>The Rails team seems more willing to break with the past between releases, but its still hampered by Ruby&#x27;s inherent performance disadvantages.<p>Ultimately, while none of these frameworks are disappearing any time soon, it&#x27;d be fair to say that many engineers, particularly those working at the edge of the industry, are choosing things like Node, or Go.",1380720743

Rails with Turbolinks, to pseudo-mimic frontend JS frameworks. Rails also implementing server side events, moving web sockets closer to &#x27;the norm&#x27;.<p>Will they still be the hot go-to languages/frameworks 5-10 years from now? Probably not. Rails will probably feel then like PHP does now(&#x27;old and safe&#x27;, with better options available for most cases), and something like Go or some other incredibly thin means of maintaining a backend API to facilitate frontend Javascript frameworks.

That&#x27;s doesn&#x27;t there is something wrong with those databases, only that they weren&#x27;t the right tool for the job is some cases.<p>Also &quot;MySQL problems&quot; are most of the time due to poor usage, not to the database system itself, actually when used properly MySQL/MyISAM is a great tool",1380719313

Instead of chasing an ever higher salary, can I instead work less? My preference would be to 30 hour work week spread over 3 consecutive 10 hour days. I understand that the pay-cut to current schemes would be more than 25% due to benefit costs and other constant per-employee costs. Some of that pay-cut will however be offset with commutes from farther cheaper locales.<p>Why arent employers offering such work schemes for professionals? And if they are, who are these companies?",1380719304

6482127,comment,6481319,6481523,8,0,kapowaz,,,"There may not be any conceptual difference, but there is a very significant difference in how these things you describe are used. Flash, when used badly, becomes a self-contained sandbox for the entire experience of a website. Besides security concerns, this approach is damaging to the overall experience of that site, since developers end up needing to re-implement native controls and functionality (scrollbars, form elements and keyboard navigation to name a few) in order to provide users with affordances they would otherwise take for granted. More often than not, the developer doesn&#x27;t re-implement these features and so users are left with a sub-optimal experience (even if it is more on brand, or replete with gratuitous effects and animations). This is to say nothing for the accessibility implications.<p>Since the advent of smartphones and tablets that can&#x27;t display Flash content, sites that do this have started to die out in favour of a combination of native applications and true HTML implementations. If the experience they&#x27;re going for calls for a video or canvas element (3D or otherwise) then great, go for it. But the scope of that part of the experience is implicitly reduced, and so it doesn&#x27;t result in a sub-par experience across the board (I might not be able to see your fancy WebGL 3D canvas effects, but the links to your contact us page still work).<p>What I&#x27;m worried about is that by providing a compatibility path, Flash&#x27;s imminent demise will be put on hold, and the sub-optimal experiences I described above see a resurgence. And that&#x27;s not a good thing.",1380719289

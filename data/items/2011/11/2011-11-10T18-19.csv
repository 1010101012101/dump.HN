3221304,comment,3219929,3220221,10,0,kellishaver,,,"It took my husband a while to catch on to this, too, though he really was trying. He works 3 days a week (not that he works less, just that he does it all in 3 days). He's always respected the work I do, but it took him a while to adjust to the fact that I couldn't just rearrange my schedule at the drop of a hat to take the day off to go somewhere or go out to lunch or something.<p>I'm not so busy that I don't stop to eat lunch, so we would still go out on days where I didn't have quite so much to do and could afford the extra hour or so that eating somewhere other than my dining room requires, but then he would do things like remember he needed to stop somewhere else and could we just do that while we're out so he doesn't have to drive all the way back into town? (We live in a fairly rural area) So a trip out for lunch would turn into lunch, grocery store, his business (he owns a store here in town), bank, etc. and suddenly the hour and a half I'd planned to take off had turned into three or four.<p>I can't say I blame him. I enjoy spending the time with him and it's nice to get out and do some things together during the day while the kid's in school, but it just isn't practical most days. Now we very clearly plan what we're going to do when we go out on the days I'm working and he's not.",1320951591

3221296,comment,3219663,3219663,2,0,arjn,,,"I bought the original Asus Transformer about 6 months ago and have been using it almost daily ever since. At the time it was quite difficult to find one as it was sold out almost as it arrived in stores. 
It is a fine product if not quite as good looking as the iPad 2. However it was cheaper, has IPS screen with gorilla glass, sdcard expandability and around an 8-10 hour battery life.
In the months since I bought it I've seen the number of quality apps in the appstore grow considerably. I now use the device at home about 90% of the time I need to use a computer.<p>If the Transformer Prime is along the same lines as the original transformer - with these better specs, I would say its a potential winner.",1320951483

I'm not well versed enough in Objective C to develop these myself, so I'm having to contract them out. The proposal for the two devs came back with the Mac app costing 50% more and taking 50% more in terms of time for development even though its the same exact app - literally looks and works the same. They say that things such as incorporating minimize/restore functionality and accounting for different screen sizes are what causes 50% more work. However, for the iPad development, they have to code for vertical/horizontal viewing.<p>Like I said, I don't know Objective C very well and I have very little experience with iOS/Mac dev, so I feel like I cannot make and intelligent determination on whether this seems right or not.<p>Could you please help me out?

3221273,comment,3220637,3220637,7,0,gooddelta,,,"Throwing an autocomplete at something is NOT always an upgrade. I've spent quite a bit of time thinking about country selectors, and I'll present my solution for two separate use cases here.<p>In the first case, a country selector allows a user to select a country as a component of their shipping address, a user profile, etc. The input method described in the aforementioned article suits that case decently; however, it's not immediately intuitive that a user can access some of its touted conveniences (such as the selection of a country by its short name), and in most cases, a user will not frequently return to the same country input field (i.e. they'll set up a saved shipping address ONCE, or set their home country on a social profile ONCE) which removes the possible avenue of training the user to expect the pattern.<p>In this case, the best possible user experience can be given by leveraging geo-location (either by using the JS API, or any of the myriad IP-based solutions) and making intelligent suggestions to the user. For example: If I'm a user, and I am required to enter my shipping information (including country) on a checkout page, the page's best GUESS as to where I am should be displayed first, and the user should be allowed to change that assumption quickly. For example, you might show the user a drop-down box with the page's best guess selected by the default, surrounded by nearby countries (depending upon geo-location accuracy). Secondly, flag icons actually have quite a bit of value -- many people think visually, first, and will be looking for their flag's colors. Even if the icons are minuscule, they're still incredibly helpful.<p>The second use case which I want to present is that in which a company (such as Range Rover) presents a page allowing you to select which localized version of their site you wish to visit. In Range Rover's case, this is a massive list of countries, with their respective flags. Let's be honest: part of the reason this page exists for most companies is because they wish to demonstrate how significant their global reach is, or the expenditure required to translate the site. On Range Rover's site, the US (my homeland) is buried deep on the bottom left-hand side -- to make this more usable, they could leverage the same geo-location technique discussed above, and simply provide visual differentiation between my home country, and the other countries! Everyone's goals are achieved here; usability is increased, the ""global"" feeling is imparted, and the business douches who insisted upon a massive list of countries in the first place are sated!<p>The guys who wrote this article don't understand what's possible with current technology, and therefore cannot successfully design for it.",1320951225

So if you gave someone 100K shares over 4 years, and they had been there 2 years, 50K was vested and 50k yet to vest, they are asking that you give back the 50k that have yet to vest.<p>This would be different than Skype's 'clawback' clause, and it would be slightly less onerous than canceling vested but not yet exercised options.<p>The article also suggests that choices were made based on some measure of value (and implied performance). I have seen folks who are doing ok work, but its not at the level that they are being compensated, that puts you in a tight spot. Few, if any, folks are open to a restructuring of their compensation package in a downward way (which is what Zynga is proposing it would seem). In California at least you simply ask them to leave (and the article suggested that the choice was 'accept this new lower compensation package, or leave, your choice.')<p>Frankly I think it would be less painful on the company oversall if they just laid off the folks they felt they had made the compensation error on. I don't see anything good coming out of this approach for the company, and I recognize they may think they are being compassionate by <i>not</i> firing people who, except for the size of their option grant, are doing ok.<p>Google's innovation here is something they call a 'Google Stock Unit' (GSU) (which is not an 'option' it is more like restricted stock) where the ratio of GSU to actual stock is fixed at the time it vests by a perfomance multiplier. That way they can offer a hot shot person 2500 shares of 'restricted' stock (market value of 1.25M$) which vests in four chunks of 625 'units' a year, and if you didn't meet your goal that year your multiplier could be less than 1.0 even 0. So they wouldn't actually have to give it to you if you weren't a hot shot inside of Google. To be fair the multiplier could, in theory, be greater than 1.0 too. The cleverness of that scheme is that the company could 'tune' the compensation of someone dynamically.<p>I'm guessing Zynga might be wishing they could do something similar for ISO type options.",1320949867

Also, most computer components are designed to be air cooled in an office setting so they can get fairly warm with little damage. In other words to keep an 80w CPU at 45 to 50c might take water at 35c but air at 20c.  If the outside air is 40c then then you only need to actively drop the water 5deg where air needs to drop 20deg and cooling systems are much more efficient for small changes in temperature than large ones.  You can probably find many cases where air temperature water is perfectly acceptable where you would want chilled air to do the same thing.<p>PS: 40c = 104f and most cpu's are fine at 50c most are still ok at 60+c.  If the outside temperature is more reasonable you can often get away with passively cooling water systems where air needs to be actively cooled.  You can also combine this with other methods aka if a local lake can give you water below 30c most of the year you might be able to use a passive cooling system with water even if you would need to actively cool air.",1320949532

3221094,comment,3220819,3221018,51,0,api,,,"I'll do a quick summary.<p>Episode 1: (this is the one that most directly affected me)<p>I was working on a very interesting but somewhat far-off technology. I did some tech talks about it, and put them on Google Video. Was approached by a guy who said he was a wealthy early-stage technology investor. He showed me a lot of stuff that indicated that this was the case, had a lot of real people vouching for him, etc.<p>He made me an offer of a cash investment over a period of two years in exchange for a percentage ownership in a company I would create. I got a lawyer, did a contract, and was very excited. We'd work with early stage customers, iterate, and he'd support the hiring of two additional people to do R&D work. (The technology was a machine learning application.) He even had some existing customers lined up and interested in bio-medical, oil and gas, and other industries.<p>Came to find out that: a) this guy has <i>almost no money at all</i> and is a complete fraud, b) everyone he associated with literally has a different picture of reality. It was pretty amazing. Some people thought he was associated with a company that he only acted as a salesman for, for example.<p>I walk. In doing so I have to walk away from approximately three years of work because the ownership of said work is now tied to an entity that this guy <i>could</i> have a potential claim on.<p>Guy turns out to also be a f'ing lunatic. He threatens my life verbally. I contemplate buying a handgun.<p>Episode 2:<p>I meet a promising entrepreneur who is interested in bio-med stuff. He's working on a protein classification company. He asks me if I'd be interested in joining as a software engineer. I say sure.<p>He sends my resume out to his investors, only he's listing me as having degrees I don't have. I e-mail him about this. He asks me to personally write up a CV and coaches me on how to pad my resume.<p>I walk.<p>Episode 3:<p>I join a consulting firm that does early stage tech R&D and business consulting for startups. This one involves me only indirectly, but while there I get to witness several pieces of rather astounding sleazery.<p>One episode involved a company that was formed to build a video delivery device. We did a bunch of R&D for them. They were basically a sales pit: founder was a salesman, and he hired a bunch of salesmen to go sell ahead into the market and hired us to build a prototype. (Nothing wrong so far.) But the market didn't seem to be too interested, so he pulled the plug. Walked. Left our firm with almost $100k in uncollected bills. We do some investigation and find out that this guy's name is on over a dozen defunct LLCs.<p>Another episode involved a guy who was ""known"" as a ""genius,"" a ""business God"" as one person called him. In this case we did actually get paid, but... the guy was a complete f'ing lunatic. He would berate and insult his employees, sexually harass women, and we come to find out that he'd been sued multiple times by previous partners. We were lucky to get paid... mostly because someone other than this guy was footing the bill. (That someone later pulled the plug.)<p>Consulting firm shutters its doors. I can't blame the guy. I mean... I didn't have to actually negotiate with these pricks. I just worked for the place. He did.<p>Episode 4:<p>Join a startup doing mobile devices. We get funded to develop something, and we're on the verge of making a sale, when the parent company decides to pull the plug. We were inches away. Millimeters away. Then the parent company decides to screw over our development partner.<p>That's it. I'm out. No more startups for me, unless it's my own.<p>Now here is my question:<p><i>Do they actually teach this s--t in business school? What the hell?</i> I had a friend when I was much younger who got into some shady stuff including drug trafficking, and he told me a lot of stories. None of them approached what I experienced in the ""legitimate"" business world.",1320948834

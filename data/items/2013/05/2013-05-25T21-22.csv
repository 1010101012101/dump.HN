It's not about reading/not reading, but only about going to a different page. If a user does not view any other page within the same site, even if they stayed for 2 hours and have read the whole thing twice, then they still 'bounced'.<p>That said, I still agree with you that conceptually, you might want to measure engagement.

5768972,comment,5767985,5767985,5,0,febeling,,,"One of the most confusing things about designing for programmers and other brainy / rational-minded people is, that when you read about it by actual practitioners, you mostly look at post-rationalisations. That means you can't expect to have reproducibly success with applying them. Quite often someone does the opposite of what the rules suggest, and meets much approval.<p>Designers will tell you about depth, and structure, and rhythms, emphasis, and similar categories. But it is often not obvious how you create these effects with color or shape or other design means. Or when you have them, they don't convince anyone and get scraped, even though fulfilling the formal requirements.<p>So what you read about design is not really what designers do to achieve great results, it is rather what they like to think about while working. Or that is my interpretation of this process. For a rationally thinking person, it is often just not conclusive and confusing, and you wonder about what you are being told and what it has to do with some specific decision.<p>The thing is that nobody really knows how to create beauty or good design, mostly because nobody knows what goodness is here. (Some try to sidestep the whole discussion by demanding reduction to functionally essentials, but that yields mixed results.)<p>For me personally other strategies have been much more helpful:<p>- expect hard work and some suffering: to create something of great quality, you have to go through a painful process of searching, thinking about meaning, trying different approaches, and learning techniques. Expect it every time anew. (You can vary the same design, or style, though, and thereby ""reuse"" it.)<p>- don't expect to be able to synthesize design from principles; it's the other way around: you come up with it and realize it is good. Later you understand that you can find principles that can to some extend explain (but I have always felt they don't explain it sufficiently.)<p>One great discussion of this for me has been the book 'Zen and The Art of Motorcycle Maintenance"" by Robert Pirsig. I know this has somewhat of a pseudo-philosophy reputation, but I think undeservedly. (Maybe this is just because it is mandatory reading in many undergrad curriculae in the US?)",1369518208

For example, if you're doing an experiment, you should report everything that you think might make it invalid--not only what you think is right about it: other causes that could possibly explain your results; and things you thought of that you've eliminated by some other experiment, and how they worked--to make sure the other fellow can tell they have been eliminated.</i><p>> <i>Details that could throw doubt on your interpretation must be given, if you know them. You must do the best you can--if you know anything at all wrong, or possibly wrong--to explain it. If you make a theory, for example, and advertise it, or put it out, then you must also put down all the facts that disagree with it, as well as those that agree with it. There is also a more subtle problem. When you have put a lot of ideas together to make an elaborate theory, you want to make sure, when explaining what it fits, that those things it fits are not just the things that gave you the idea for the theory; but that the finished theory makes something else come out right, in addition.</i><p>It's the same for crypto.  This is where all the ""don't roll your own"" stuff comes from.  Use stuff that other people have built, and other people have poked at.<p>Many people say that Javascript crypto is a bad idea.  Considering the fact that people use cryptography to avoid being shot in the head by their oppressive government it seems irresponsible to dismiss any concerns about javascript crypto without doing rigorous testing.",1369517926

5768904,comment,5768837,5768837,27,0,daeken,,,"So, first it should be noted that this critique (and the original article) are from 2011.  Not a lot has changed since then, but it's worth noting.  Secondly, I'm an ex-Matasano employee and still friends with tptacek et al; just throwing my potential biases out on the table.<p>Now, I don't agree with every single bit of the original article, but I disagree with just about every bit of this one.  I'll go point by point.<p>>> “Any attacker who could swipe an unencrypted secret can, with almost total certainty, intercept and alter a web request.”<p>> This problem is simply mitigated by deploying Javascript cryptography in conjunction with HTTPS.<p>No, it's really not mitigated by doing so.  Because the crypto code is coming from the server you're attempting to prevent cleartext access to, the trust model is fundamentally broken here.  The server could easily throw down JS code that does not perform proper crypto operations, leaks keys, or any number of other things.  And that's not even speaking of XSS and other attacks making it trivial for an attacker to compromise your data.<p>Edit (based on edited OP): > [...] it is possible to deliver web apps as signed, local browser plugins, applications and extensions. This greatly helps with solving the problem.<p>Correct, this does mitigate some of the issue.  Namely, it allows the code to be reviewed as it is in use.  However, the server can still push code arbitrarily and completely compromise the crypto, and XSS is still an issue.<p>>> “Secure delivery of Javascript to browsers is a chicken-egg problem.”<p>> This problem, while serious, can be mitigated with the usage of browser plugins that locally verify the integrity of the Javascript code, warning the user should the code be faulty.<p>This is correct...ish.  The problem is that it still gives too much trust to the server.  The proper approach would be a browser plugin that exposes a Keyczar-style, high-level interface to JS crypto and allows secure operations on data without revealing access to the server.<p>However, this <i>still</i> isn't enough.  Take the case of Gmail adding GPG support for emails.  Let's assume you have a perfectly secure plugin such as one I described above.  Even in this case, the server-driven JS still could send unencrypted data from the DOM up to the server, before crypto operations have happened.  The trust boundaries are <i>nonexistent</i> here.<p>>> “Javascript lacks a secure random number generator.”<p>> While Javascript does not ship with a secure random number generator, [...]<p>Let's just stop here.  Doing a CSPRNG right is <i>hard</i>.  Very, <i>very</i> hard.  Thankfully, browsers are starting to implement this as part of the browser directly, making it much less likely that JS code can skew results.  This should be a solved problem soon, if it isn't already.<p>Edit (based on edited OP): They now mention the CSPRNG built into modern browsers.  As mentioned, this is 99% a solved problem.<p>>> “Javascript cryptography hasn’t implemented well-known standards such as PGP; such a high-level language can’t be trusted with cryptography.”<p>This is one point from the original article that I think is specious.  If you have the proper lego blocks, you should be able to put together things like PGP securely.  But those blocks don't exist.<p>> However, the ultimate problem with browser cryptography is that there is no standard for innate, in-browser encryption. Very much like HTML5 and CSS, there needs to be an international, vetted, audited, cross-browser standard  for browsers to be capable of securely encrypting and communicating sensitive information. There’s no denying the urgent need for such a standard , considering the ridiculous rate in which the browser is becoming pretty much the mainstream central command for personal information.<p>This I agree with.  However, every approach so far has <i>really, really, really sucked</i>.  See also: <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4549504"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4549504</a><p>To do this properly, we need a standard for high-level crypto operations, which is incredibly hard to pull off, and we need sane trust boundaries to prevent the server from skewing operations and stealing data.  I hope someone will get it right eventually.<p>Edit: Forgot to respond to one point.<p>>> “JavaScript’s ‘view-source transparency’ is illusory.”<p>> It is the case in every cryptography implementation that the implementation will need to be reviewed by an expert before being declared secure. This is no different in JavaScript, C, or Python.<p>There are a few issues here:<p>1) Generally speaking, the fact that JS source is pushed down on every access means that there's no way for you to actually review it.<p>2) Even if the crypto code is isolated and completely reviewed and found to be bulletproof, the trust boundaries are still screwed.

People simply want to use things that they themselves have proven to work before.<p>As an example an old colleague wanted to dump some data from python to a csv-file and did this by for-looping through each row and each item and concatenating each cell and a semicolon to a string. Even after pointing out to him that python already has a built in csv writer, that handles all issues of escaping etc, he didn't want to use it because he didn't know what it did and didnt want to learn anything new. His version didn't even do escaping inside the for-loop and he didn't see the issue of not doing it. To him the for-loop gave exactly the same result and didn't require any learning and was thus better, and why change something that works... My last suggestion was to at least use "";"".join(...) but it was also a bit too magic so he stuck to his well known for-loop.<p>Usually standard libraries are quite reliable but in some cases, and especially if adding third party libraries, bugs and performance issues inside the library can really give you hell. If the library is supposed to just perform a simple task maybe you would rather implement it yourself as you then also have influence to fix those issues yourself later.

The whole system is completely corrupted, people are used to get ""passe-droit"" (not sure about the translation) for anything, and even the top Political leaders are acting this way. Politician asking cops not to be fined for something illegal they just did, a friend of a friend asking the School President to let their kid attend their school, etc.<p>The whole French society is based on this.

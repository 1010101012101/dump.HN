Further, I&#x27;d suggest that you should <i>want</i> your first few employees to sleep well, so that they can provide a well-rested analysis of whatever crazy thoughts you had at 3am when you&#x27;ve had 10 hours of sleep in the last four days.

This is the classic silicon valley model, a model I love, but there has to be a light at the end of the tunnel.<p>As noted in the OP, this also reminds me a lot of Exec, and Exec didn&#x27;t work.  In the post-mortem, JK makes a very interesting point:<p>> if a job request came in and there were no Execs available to run them ... we sent someone from the office to run the jobs ourselves.  Unfortunately, this gave us a false sense that the quality of service for our customers was better than it was, as the average competence of our employees was higher than our average recruitable errand runners. [1]<p>This is a critical problem that any service business like Magic will run into.  Training and quality becomes much harder at scale, and the more you have to pay for &quot;Magicians&quot;, the more you have to charge.  And if it costs too much money, it isn&#x27;t &quot;Magical&quot; anymore.  Yes, they have advantages over Exec because they can arbitrage less expensive labor overseas, but quality at an efficient price is still going to be a huge issue.<p>1: <a href=""http://justinkan.com/exec-errands-post-mortem"" rel=""nofollow"">http://justinkan.com/exec-errands-post-mortem</a>",1434844591

9751481,comment,9751200,9751200,0,0,michaelochurch,,,"First, I think that people aren&#x27;t becoming less uncivil but that environments are getting worse. If anything (although this is probably an artifact of increasing age and status) people seem to be getting better, on the whole: fewer mean jokes and exclusionary behaviors. Work environments, with the open-plan trend, are getting a lot worse and more stressful. It used to be that an off-color joke was heard by 2 people in a private office; now it&#x27;s heard by 40 in a bullpen. Open-plan offices tend to magnify the cumulative effects of microaggressions, which is one of the reasons why every population except for the most constitutionally insensitive one (those who&#x27;ve never had negative experiences, either due to general inexperience or a combination of privilege and luck) hates them.<p>Second, when you&#x27;re aggressive or even uncivil, it hurts you with that person. That said, it can be beneficial-- in very small doses. Punching down is bad, while punching up is risky (the best target is a person of high status, that is &quot;punching up&quot;, and low character, but with no real power) and if you&#x27;re perceived as being uncivil for personal benefit, you&#x27;re just considered an asshole. Usually, uncivil behavior is to one&#x27;s benefit when (and pretty much only when) one is perceived as being that way <i>for the group</i>: you&#x27;re a protector. People tire of selfish rule-breakers and firebrands, but those who behave in such ways for group benefit tend to inspire loyalty.<p>Don&#x27;t get me wrong: it&#x27;s generally best not to be uncivil or arrogant at all. It&#x27;s just not intellectually honest to say that it&#x27;s always socially detrimental to be that way. You have to be extremely selective in your targets to make it work, though.",1434844425

I don&#x27;t get it. YC doesn&#x27;t guarantee success. From what I read, YC gets the pick of the litter, the rejects either raise money from others or bootstrap or just go back to the workforce.

> It&#x27;s completely free to chat with Magic. When you order something, we&#x27;ll let you know the total price so you can confirm it before you are billed. There are no hidden fees, and tip is included.<p>There could be a large amount of inquiries that do not result in purchase, however a real person will be looped in.

Some of the findings from the report:<p>> <i>The GAO report is the most damning. Investigators noted that the library could not confidently estimate how much its spends annually on IT costs, although the GAO offered a guess of $120 million, about one-fifth of the library’s total budget.</i><p><i>“They don’t know what they spend, they don’t know what they have,” said Joel C. Willemssen, the report’s author. “The fact they have had five acting CIOs in less than three years, that’s a big concern.”</i><p><i>GAO investigators found the library’s master list of personal computers numbered 18,000 when it actually had fewer than 6,500. The number of systems used by the various units was listed at 30 but another was tallied at 46. “After we raised the discrepancy . . . [the library] provided us with a revised list of 70 systems,” the GAO said.</i><p>Part of this will be spun as an &quot;old-people-don&#x27;t-get-technology&quot; thing...that Billington being 86+ years old meant that he was unable to manage the library&#x27;s transition to the digital age. To put that in perspective, he was nearly 50-years-old by the time the Apple ][ came out. But I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s the right lesson to take...Older people <i>can</i> learn computers just fine as an intellectual pursuit, it&#x27;s just that many of them don&#x27;t have much reason to, especially if they are near retirement or have a job that&#x27;s not computer-related. It&#x27;s a matter of incentive; if their job required computers, and they value having a salary, anyone can become adequately acquainted with the computer.<p>But it just sounds like Billington, among other things, was just a bad/aloof manager, something that can get exacerbated over time if you&#x27;re at the same job for 10/20/30+ years. If he was also willfully ignorant/uncurious about the digital age, e.g. &quot;Books, radios, computers; they&#x27;re all the same thing&quot;...then it would seem that the LoC&#x27;s technological progress would happen in spite of, rather than because of its leader&#x27;s vision.<p>But if an 85-year old leader who is still interested in the work even 20 years after he could&#x27;ve retired to a nice pension, and engaged enough to humble himself to learn new technology. Sure, I&#x27;ll take that any day over a 30-something startup-millionaire. I think institutional memory is very important, and being liked and respected by everyone who controls your budget is not an insignificant asset, especially when it comes to libraries.",1434841841

Me trying to explain to you all of his ideas about solving physics problems is not going to be a worthwhile use of either of our time. If you want to understand that, you should read his books and papers, try to solve the problems therein, apply those tools and approaches to your own problems, etc. Reading a few paragraphs on an internet forum is not going to make these ideas sink in.<p>You said:<p>> <i>it sure sounds like he&#x27;s talking about teaching vectors as geometric objects with various manipulation rules and avoiding coordinate descriptions. [...] This is actually the sort of angle that [...] is not [possible] for physicists. [... For] physics, it is absolute essential that you are also able to think about vectors in terms of coordinates if you are to connect them to the real physical world, which has rulers and T-squares and so on. Physicists are trying to understand the world, not the abstraction.</i><p>The laws of the “real physical world” are absolutely not defined by T-squares or rulers. Those are imperfect measurement devices which we use to help us learn approximate relationships between things in the world and some human-defined standard measurement, but there is nothing fundamental about rulers. The fundamental thing is the structural/spatial relationships between objects which are directly interacting in whatever system we care about, not the tick marks on some stick which were drawn by a machine based on other tick marks drawn on some arbitrary global reference stick.<p>In any event, it is obvious that Hestenes doesn’t want to abolish measurement devices or ban the use of coordinates. You’re basically arguing with a straw man.<p>If you really want to get Hestenes’s answer to your comments, I suggest emailing him directly, instead of trying to get some strangers on Hacker News to stand in as proxies. I suspect he’ll be willing to at least point you at other sources to read, even if he doesn’t answer in detail.<p>> <i>In my teaching experience as a graduate student, students adopt the geometric picture of a vector as soon as they are able to, because it&#x27;s vastly easier and more pleasant to work with. (That&#x27;s why the abstraction was originally developed.)</i><p>The geometric picture of a vector <i>is</i> the vector, and insofar as it’s “an abstraction” it is because the concept of a vector is itself the abstraction in question. The geometrical properties and relations of vectors are the fundamental nature of vectors. If students “struggle to build the proper abstract machinery in their brains”, what that means is <i>they haven’t actually learned or properly been taught what a vector is yet</i>.<p>Many many scientists I have met, and especially many engineers, when confronted with a problem, immediately start reaching for measurement devices and coordinate systems.

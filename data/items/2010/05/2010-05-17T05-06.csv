1353686,comment,1353587,1353587,0,0,jackowayed,,,"I agree that they're probably screwed--on top of the normal how-do-you-get-enough-people-to-switch-that-users-get-real-utility-out-of-the-social-network issue, people now expect, by virtue of the fact that they've got $170k and lots of attention, that they have something ready to compete with Facebook by the end of the summer--but I don't think they would have done any better waiting.<p>By doing it this way, they got to strike while the iron was hot. Right as Open Graph and the dozens of ""Facebook is pure evil"" posts were fresh in people's minds, they asked for money. With startups, the best time to raise money is when people badly want to give it to you, and it's no different here. If they had waited a few months, not only might they have had trouble paying their living expenses for the summer and their tuition bills in the fall, but they also, had they asked for donations after a summer of getting a crude v1 together, would have had a much harder time getting the money because Facebook privacy concerns wouldn't be as strongly in people's minds as they are now. Do you think they'd get anywhere near $170k with a v1--which would be nowhere near ready to kill Facebook--but in a few months when most people don't care anymore? In fact, it's quite possible that having a crude version 1 today would get them less money. Right now, they're selling nothing but ideas, which are easy for anti-Facebookers to latch onto. If they had a rudimentary implementation, potentially donors would be thinking about all of the ways in which the product sucks, not all of the ways in which it could be great. By having no product to criticize, they get the donors to dream.<p>And at least this way, they're set financially. They'll still probably fail, but probabilistically, they were going to fail either way. This way, if they do manage to ignore the hype and get a great product built, they'll definitely have money when they need it.<p>Another way that this does help them is something PG has pointed to--fear of failure. If they were just friends hacking this thing together in their spare time, maybe they would have made some grand statements to a few friends and family members, but there'd be a pretty low barrier to saying, ""oh, building something with Facebook's capabilities is extremely hard. And even if we do a decent job, we probably won't get any users. Let's go play video games."" But now, they can't give up entirely. They have to at least build something that sort of gets the job done. Thousand of people gave them money to do so, so they have a duty to do it. And millions of people read the articles about Diaspora and will read about it again if they fail. If Diaspora becomes a joke, every potential employer of theirs will think of them as ""the guys who failed miserably at building Diaspora."" All of a sudden, failure comes with a very high cost.",1274075668
1353685,comment,1353140,1353140,0,0,jrockway,,,"I wish we would stop calling drawings of small girls with boobs ""child pornography"".  Not you thing?  Sure.  ""Obscene"" under the Miller Test?  Possibly.  Graphical depiction of the abuse of actual children?  Nope.  Drawn by people who abuse children?  Nope.  Enjoyed by people who abuse children?  No more so than Fox News is.<p>In order to approach the problem of obscenity on Wikipedia rationally, we need to call a spade a spade.  This has nothing to do with child pornography; that expression is only being used because it stirs up so much automatic hate.  When all we can think about is hate and protecting our children, we can't think about the actual problem.<p>Criticizing Jimmy Wales until he deletes some pictures from Wikipedia is not going to prevent a single child from being abused.  So if we really care about child abuse, we should think about focusing our attention on something other than Wikipedia.  Perhaps child abusers...<p>(I guess this is a little off-topic, but having done a bit of research into this, I haven't seen anything on Wikipedia that remotely resembles pornography with children.  But the media, even tech-savvy sources without a religious agenda, keep using that term, and it's not helping the discussion at all.)",1274075577

1353681,comment,1353144,1353640,0,0,derefr,,,"I said nothing about Facebook. Facebook is a manifestation of a social network, and thus cannot <i>be</i> private by definition. All it does is allow people to spread things, and to do it efficiently as possible; it has no other use. Privacy exists <i>going into</i> the Internet, not <i>on</i> the Internet.<p>But the Internet is not the problem. Instead, the problem is this attitude:<p>> If someone in my circle of friends shares something with the outside world that they shouldn't have, then they are in the wrong and will have to accept whatever the punishment is<p><i>This isn't how the real world works</i>.<p>Your friends have other trusted friends that <i>aren't</i> you. The separation isn't between ""my circle of friends"" and ""the outside world""; there <i>is</i> no ""outside world."" Your circle of friends each has their own circles of friends, who have their own, and those circles, together, comprise the entirety of the world. There is no separation; no barrier there. It's a problem of incorrect perspective to put a dividing line around the people connected to <i>you</i> and no one else—because, to everyone else, that's not where the line is. It's around <i>them</i>, and <i>their</i> friends.<p>You'll ask your friend for advice on something, who will delegate the question to their own friend. You tell someone a secret and ten other people will find out, all in complete confidence. You'll end up doing embarrassing things in other people's wedding pictures, or being captured in a photo alongside them in a bar. This isn't something that can remain private, because these <i>aren't facts about you</i>. They're stories occurring in other people's worlds, in other people's circles—they just happen, tangentially, to have you as <i>a property</i> of them.<p>Now, usually, all this leaked information doesn't <i>come back</i> to you—people have the sensibility to keep the secret secret. And the world goes on that way just fine. Ten people will know about something embarrassing you did, but, because they are aware of the rules of our culture, they won't tell you they know, and you can go on leading your life pretending nobody knows.<p>The problem with the privacy after the advent of the Internet is <i>not</i> that these people now know your secrets. The problem with the Internet is that it makes <i>the slip-ups of the third-parties</i> public, permanent, and irrevocable. It vocalizes the maid-and-butler conversations that we all managed to pretend weren't happening, and, in doing so, ruins our collective facade of propriety.<p>And, unless we throw away everything about how the Internet works, we're just going to have to learn to work around that permanence. If anything, we need to kill <i>the desire for sites like Facebook</i>, not Facebook itself; we need to remove ourselves from our collective lecterns and podiums before we ruminate upon others' secrets. And that's hard–that's changing human nature, or at the very least, the nature of Western society. But that's what we have to do, if we want to keep this gift of a worldwide network of permanently-remembering machines alive.<p>(And note—what Facebook is doing right now has nothing to do with all of this. Everything that Facebook has done to ""decrease"" the privacy level of its userbase could have been done by a third-party by collecting the login details of a few not-particularly-privacy-conscious[1] volunteers and then spidering Facebook from their viewpoints, re-building its social graph within their own servers. This could still be done today, and is <i>not</i> an exploit that can be patched in any way, shape or form. As I said: social networks are inherently public.)<p>[1] Like these: <a href=""http://www.silicon.com/special-features/protecting-your-id/2004/03/19/one-in-five-brits-not-learning-id-theft-lessons-39119357/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.silicon.com/special-features/protecting-your-id/2...</a>",1274075259

As ludicrous as that sounds, that is the basic claim that one makes when asserting that, 'no information shared between two people is 100% guaranteed to be private.'<p>Whether you realize it or not, your basic claim -- at its heart -- is that it's ok for Facebook to breach your trust just because it's also possible for other people to do so.",1274073819

1353621,comment,1349394,1349918,0,0,lsc,,,"Yeah, that's pretty much how I feel about it.  Of course, most of my 'stuff' consists of computer parts, so it's while it's pretty important for me to periodically go through and throw out stuff that is beyond a certain age,  having this stuff around saves me quite a bit of money/time when assembling or repairing servers. more, usually than throwing out or giving away the stuff that has become garbage in the last 6 months costs me.<p>I think all problems with having too much 'stuff' stem from this idea that you need to take care of this stuff as if it were a family member.  If you are skipping opportunities because you are unwilling to get rid of your stuff, or if you end up spending time that would be better spent on other things dealing with your stuff, if you avoid taking risks because you are afraid of damaging your stuff, then yeah, you have a problem.<p>All my stuff (aside from production servers)  is essentially disposable.   you could take everything I personally own, and eh, really, I wouldn't cry.  I'd have to replace much of it, granted, but hell, most of my stuff is cheap.  I make it a rule not to own a car that costs more than a month's pay.   Yeah, I like having nice tools.  But I don't like it enough to spend more than a few days pay on something that becomes obsolete as fast as a laptop.  (I'm typing this on a thinkpad x60S.   I got it used for $400 a little under two years ago) The drive is encrypted, so really if it gets lost or stolen, I shrug, change my login keys, and get a new one.<p>The idea is that stuff is... stuff.  It exists for your convenience.    When it stops being convenient, it should be promptly removed from your life.   Be vary careful about owning stuff that is so expensive that worrying about losing it causes you stress.  That is the 'stuff' that will tie you down, and that should be avoided, I think.<p>Really, I think the comments about 'stuff owning you' are wise, in a way-   You need to be very careful about what things you allow to have a claim over you.   Relationships with other people, yeah, those have a certain claim on you, but like most people, I think that's worth it.   My production servers; my business- that has a claim on me, but again, I think that's worth it.   Allowing 'stuff' to have a claim on me?  emphatically not worth it.    But, as 'stuff' is inanimate, I can easily have a claim on 'stuff' without allowing it to have a claim on me.",1274072967

Due to network effects, you're going to have a tough time pulling people over to your service when their friends are on Facebook/Twitter/Reddit/etc.<p>To summarize, you're entering a competitive space and your revenue plan sounds shaky.

The NVAC ( <a href=""http://nvac.pnl.gov/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://nvac.pnl.gov/</a> ) place is peopled by lots of non-PhD hacker types doing cool things. Many of the better hacker types I've run across are also not from traditional CS backgrounds which is interesting, lots of trained physicists and mathematicians.<p>The non-profit types have loads of people who are not-PhDs who do clever think-tank style work for the government. Lots of report writing mostly, but if you can get latched onto some IRAD type project and do internal R&D work, you can see some really cool stuff -- I'm pretty sure I've seen the first ever real-time fusion of geospatial data from six different imagery platforms in a 3d environment. But even the report writing can be interesting, things like open-source studies of countries, industries, facilities, etc. But they can also be a back door into the lab work if you work for one of the managing organizations (like Battelle). Look into them closely as they also tend to have fairly large internal R&D departments. It's possible to make a career working on IRAD projects and responding to SBIR grants. Both are pure research.<p>Other places do things like geospatial systems research, text mining, information visualization, network security research (which for lab purposes usually requires lots of high level systems understanding or solid math, not as much low level hacking as you might expect, lots of the work is in predictive theories and social network analysis), pattern detection, image analysis, image change detection -- lots of good places for applied math, acoustic triangulation, emergency response modeling and simulation, etc. Think DARPA style research, which the labs do lots of work for.<p>If you are into hardware, there's also plenty of that, communication systems, weapons testing (like naval guns), hardware encryption systems, phased array radars, biochem detection systems, rapid prototyping, radiation detectors etc.<p>Most of these don't require PhD backgrounds, and if you hit all the ones you are interested in, you might find something that sticks.<p>Honestly, given your background, you'd probably find a better home at the labs than the companies. But the hiring cycle is abysmally slow, don't take a non-response as evidence of a lack of desire to hire. 6-12 month wait times on call backs are not uncommon. Often followed by 5-20 years of happy employment.<p>I personally found both the lab and non-profit environments a bit too rarefied for my tastes. But I <i>do</i> miss being surrounded by brilliant people every day. Also, keep in mind that some of these are enormous organizations, Google-sized by way of comparison, their campuses can be measured in square-miles, not acres and they often have tens of thousands of employees. If you don't live in the States (or aren't a citizen), there are probably equivalent organizations in your home country. Often there is lots of cross-pollination as well, I worked on projects with the Brits, the Italians, Singapore and the Aussies.",1274072606

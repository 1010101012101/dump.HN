9811507,comment,9810342,9811325,0,0,JoshuaScholar,,,"[edit, I wrote this before you changed your comment so say &quot;one-shot&quot;. In short my continuations are not one shot, they are delimited though, by necessity because I don&#x27;t rewrite ALL functions into continuation passing style, and you can&#x27;t recast what lua calls metafunctions.]<p>Continuations are not coroutines.<p>Continuations let you save the current position, like setjump/longjump. But unlike setjump/longjump you can continue inside a function that already returned, ie as long as there is a continuation remembering that position then the activation record can&#x27;t be deleted.<p>That means that activation records (ie local variables) can&#x27;t be just the top of the stack - it changes things deep.<p>Also note that continuations only save the position, they don&#x27;t restore the values of variables to what they were at that position, so re-evaluating continuation more than once will break any code that wasn&#x27;t expecting to re-run.<p>Something that snapshots some local variables as well as the position will be more useful than raw continuations for things like search, backtracking, and logical programming languages.<p>[edit 2, I am ALSO adding snapshot continuations for these purposes]<p>Running an OUTER continuation rather than an inner one looks like an exception.",1435755519

It was designed to use the same transport as signalling - when no signalling information was being sent - you could send a SMS - so essentially was free for the operator to provide.<p>In the beginning it was thought that only technicians would utilize SMS messaging [0]? The &#x27;public&#x27; would all be using pagers to get their text. Turned out to be the opposite.

2. Add a variant of end points to change the point of focus.
3. Perhaps even add a &quot;bomb&quot; element. So, if you get X amount of points, you gain bombs (think geometry wars or pacman championship). The bombs will allow you to sort of reset the built up arrows when things get a bit difficult.<p>Score : 4400",1435755257

I very well acknowledge that others, who are no less talented, might prefer <i>more</i> abstractions.<p>However, I <i>am</i> saying that the assumption that better developers invariably prefer more abstractions and more powerful languages is absolutely wrong.<p>Personally, I&#x27;ve had a terrible experience with Scala, found its abstractions distracting, its complexity hindering readability, its DSLism obstructing code sharing and staff migration among various teams, and the grapple with the tool stack a horrible waste of time -- all with little benefit and lots of harm. I know that my experience isn&#x27;t universal, but it&#x27;s far from unique, either.<p>Clojure is a completely different story, partly because its designers are not purists and not interested (at least not as a primary concern) in PL research, but even with Clojure I don&#x27;t think we have enough data to conclude that its cleverness (which, thankfully, is much lower than Scala&#x27;s[1]) is a net gain for large projects that require maintenance for a decade or more by large teams.<p>All in all, I&#x27;ve seen that a solid, fast runtime with a good compilation and linking story, excellent profilers and deep monitoring (all provided by the JVM) yield much bigger gains than most new languages. Given that those extra-linguistic features are free and switching a language is <i>extremely</i> costly, I&#x27;m always hesitant about whether it&#x27;s worth it. Staying on the JVM reduces the switching costs, and good interoperation with Java -- like Clojure has -- reduces it further, so I find the risk to be worth it for some less-risky projects.<p>[1]: Then again, so is every other language in history.",1435753607

I&#x27;ve tried to avoid that, but entering this space without promising (seemingly) nonsensical things means that you won&#x27;t gather much traction.<p>And I&#x27;m OK with that. I will rather build good tech and be honest with my users, rather than giving them a false sense of security.  As I mentioned in another HN comment the other day[0], I have mostly been operating in a niche market in Iceland, circumventing dual pricing for bandwidth on home connections.<p>VPNs are good for some things, but they are not tools made to give you absolute privacy as some claim. I&#x27;ve been running Tor exit nodes and tried to be as clear as I can about what a VPN is and what it is not.<p>I have also tried to keep most of my code on GitHub[1] with AGPL as license, and I&#x27;m not aware of any other provider that does this. Of course, it won&#x27;t help with the issues outlined in this paper and I probably should have published server configs as well. But this project is nearing it&#x27;s end for me, so it&#x27;s probably too late for that. Although I&#x27;m not opposed to cleaning up that repository and publishing on GitHub.<p>Since starting this project I have watched about a dozen VPN providers start up, make ridiculous claims (this paper mentions some VPN providers claiming to provide better privacy protections than Tor) and often disappear just as quickly as they appeared. This market boomed after Snowden and a lot of the providers will not shy away from outright lying to their customers. I&#x27;d like to give them the benefit of the doubt because maybe they don&#x27;t fully understand themselves what a VPN is. But thats even worse.<p>This entire market is weird. A recent example that comes to mind is a certain VPN provider posted on reddit[2] claiming that even themselves cannot see the IP address of their clients. The reddit thread was deleted shortly after I responded, but the claim remains on their blog.<p>Of course not all providers do this. I have on purpose not been naming the providers I have been talking about. As always, be careful about who you trust and what you trust them with.<p>I have shared this paper in the capacity of Lokun.<p>[0]: <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=9791770"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=9791770</a><p>[1]: <a href=""https://github.com/benediktkr/lokun-record"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/benediktkr/lokun-record</a><p>[2]: <a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/VPN/comments/3aecvi/how_we_keep_your_real_ip_address_hidden_even_from/csbvo1h"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.reddit.com/r/VPN/comments/3aecvi/how_we_keep_you...</a>",1435753511

The thing about x86 is that the instruction stream isn&#x27;t self-synchronizing, it&#x27;s hard and occasionally impossible to figure out where the instruction boundaries are if you don&#x27;t decode progressively from the front.  This means that to decode mulitple instructions per clock cycle x86 has to use complicated voodoo.",1435752590

On the one hand, companies want someone who&#x27;ll deliver, and they&#x27;ll pick technology based on how cheap programmers you can find (reminds me of my ex-boss&#x27;s answer to the question why won&#x27;t they upgrade the tech stack - &quot;well, we could go with something else, for example Ruby, but non-PHP programmers are too expensive&quot;). Or they&#x27;ll pick whatever platform upper-level management already decided to buy. On the other hand, a lot - if not most - developers learned the profession out of joy of programming (the recent trend of learning programming because of a career choice is a domain of the new generation). Learning something new, or using tools that are efficient and convenient, is an important part of the development process, because without enjoyment, developers burn out.

I notice the dynamics are different in a really big company versus a small one though. Like if you&#x27;re in a large company, meetings tend to cast a wide net and usually it&#x27;s impossible to get 100% attendance anyway, so it&#x27;s a lot easier to hide (metaphorically). Especially if you&#x27;ve sort of built a mystique of having a lot of fish on the fryer. On the other hand, in a small organization people are pretty aware of each others business, so it&#x27;s a lot harder to pull the &quot;gosh I wanted to attend but I had this other thing come up...&quot; card. Then you have to be a little bit more direct with the &quot;I have things to do and this isn&#x27;t that important&#x27; deal.<p>If I were to wear my slightly evil hat though, I would say it&#x27;s useful to occasionally decline meetings.

This means that there is more redundant information per-packet as a durability measure.<p>UDP-based streams also often have something called forward error correction (FEC). This is where you encode lower quality versions of media samples in subsequent packets. Again this is trading more bandwidth for realtime durability. If you miss a packet, then the next packet probably has the same media sample in a lower quality, and your 100ms jitter buffer gives you just enough time to make use of it. This is far more time-efficient than requiring the receiver to ask the sender to retransmit a missed packet.<p>To the point about retransmission: in UDP cases, it&#x27;s often not worth bothering about. By the time you round-trip the request, you&#x27;ve probably already received more recent media.<p>I should say that this isn&#x27;t about TCP vs UDP so much as it is about buffered vs realtime streaming.",1416544848

To her, it&#x27;s either sell books like deodorant or some ideal system where it&#x27;s quality, not marketability, that makes books sell.  This sounds good, but it&#x27;s tripe.  As you say, the Internet in general and Amazon in particular have opened up publishing -- Amazon getting huge credit because it not only allows freer publishing, but has set up a system that allows many thousands of new authors to actually connect with readers.  Yet, Amazon is also a business focused on selling products at high volume with tight margins.  These two goals aren&#x27;t opposed, they&#x27;re different aspects of a complex business.  Amazon can be both a great contributor and profit-motivated, it&#x27;s not that hard to see how.<p>Who defines quality, anyway? The tastemakers, like newspaper reviewers, who nobody much pays attention to anymore?  Or Le Guin -- she seems to think she knows what&#x27;s good.

What if he&#x27;d been able to sell his work like toothpaste on Amazon, even if the tastemakers thought it wasn&#x27;t worth publishing.

8639814,comment,8637646,8637646,0,0,userbinator,,,"I think AV software, despite all the benefits that it provides, also has a very dangerous dark side - it encourages more-or-less blind trust by its users, and thus can be used as a very powerful means of control to further an agenda. The most common example of this is the detection of keygens/cracks/patches as being malicious, many of which are clearly not (at least back when I was still into that stuff around a decade ago - not sure about now); I&#x27;m a reverse-engineer so I can inspect the files manually and see the truth, but the average user will be far more likely to believe their AV and assume it&#x27;s malicious --- helping to spread the FUD. Seeing how things as simple as completely innocent &quot;Hello World&quot; programs can get detected as false positives[1][2][3][4][5][6][7] while state-sponsored spyware gets let through is <i>very</i> deeply disturbing.<p>IMHO signature/heuristic-based detection techniques are always prone to error, and should be replaced with behaviour-based detection (and blocking). At the moment, I think a good firewall (on another known-clean machine - ideally running 100% open-source software) should be enough to detect any suspicious network traffic.<p>[1] <a href=""http://forums.avg.com/us-en/avg-forums?sec=thread&act=show&id=217712"" rel=""nofollow"">http://forums.avg.com/us-en/avg-forums?sec=thread&act=show&i...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/22926360/malwarebytes-gives-trojan-warning-for-basic-c-sharp-hello-world-program"" rel=""nofollow"">http://stackoverflow.com/questions/22926360/malwarebytes-giv...</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://forum.bitdefender.com/index.php?showtopic=45169"" rel=""nofollow"">http://forum.bitdefender.com/index.php?showtopic=45169</a><p>[4] <a href=""http://board.flatassembler.net/topic.php?t=8154"" rel=""nofollow"">http://board.flatassembler.net/topic.php?t=8154</a><p>[5] <a href=""https://forum.avast.com/index.php?topic=152926.0"" rel=""nofollow"">https://forum.avast.com/index.php?topic=152926.0</a><p>[6] <a href=""https://forum.avast.com/index.php?topic=120578.0"" rel=""nofollow"">https://forum.avast.com/index.php?topic=120578.0</a><p>[7] <a href=""http://itsacleanmachine.blogspot.ca/2012/01/antivirus-anger.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://itsacleanmachine.blogspot.ca/2012/01/antivirus-anger....</a>",1416544233

    [...]
    real    0m1.990s
    user    0m1.937s
    sys     0m0.049s
    [root@stats ~]# time grep &quot;number 123456&quot; /tmp/file
    [...]
    real    0m0.158s
    user    0m0.115s
    sys     0m0.035s
    [root@stats ~]# time egrep &quot;number 123456&quot; /tmp/file
    [...]
    real    0m0.150s
    user    0m0.127s
    sys     0m0.023s
</code></pre>
But what happens if we use a slightly more complex expression?<p><pre><code>    [root@stats ~]# time perl -ne &#x27;print if /number [1]23456/&#x27; < /tmp/file
    [...]
    real    0m1.989s
    user    0m1.925s
    sys     0m0.047s
    [root@stats ~]# time grep &quot;number [1]23456&quot; /tmp/file
    [...]
    real    0m1.402s
    user    0m1.366s
    sys     0m0.022s
    [root@stats ~]# time egrep &quot;number [1]23456&quot; /tmp/file

    real    0m1.414s
    user    0m1.382s
    sys     0m0.031s
</code></pre>
The difference becomes much less pronounced.  What if we make the expression just a bit more complex?<p><pre><code>    [root@stats ~]# time perl -ne &#x27;print if /number [1]23456[0-9]*/&#x27; < /tmp/file
    [...]

    sys     0m0.037s
    [root@stats ~]# time egrep &quot;number [1]23456[0-9]*&quot; /tmp/file
    [...]

    sys     0m0.045s
</code></pre>
So, now we have the Perl regex engine fairly static across extra complexity while grep and egrep are seeing order of magnitude time increases, and are <i>much</i> slower than Perl at this point.  I suspect your first benchmark was the result of a specific optimization grep has that Perl doesn&#x27;t, or it may be that grep was able to switch to using a DFA regex for that first case, while Perl doesn&#x27;t both with a completely different regex implementation for special cases like that.<p>Anecdata: I needed to process a large amount of XML a while back, to the point where a week spent testing and optimizing XML parsing libraries in Perl was worth it, because it could shave weeks or months off the processing time.  The winner?  A regex that captured attributes and content and assigned name/value pairs directly out to a hash.  This was only possible because the XML was highly normalized, but it was actually <i>over 10 times faster</i> than the closest competitor for XML parsing I could fine, and I checked all the libXML libXML2, and SAX libraries I could get my hands on.<p>In the end, it was something as simple as the following approximation:<p><pre><code>    while (my ($doc) = $xml =~ /$get_record_xml_re/) {
        my %hash = $get_record_xml =~ /$record_begin_re$capture_name_and_value_pairs_re$record_end_re/;
        process_record( \%hash );
    }</code></pre>",1416543284

User comments posted in social media are difficult to find after some time has passed, so removing comments from articles makes it difficult for future readers to get sense of the discussion around an article.<p>While some re/code stories do generate great discussions, most don&#x27;t. This move is a way for them to avoid reinforcing the feeling that there aren&#x27;t many readers.",1416543128
8639775,comment,8632749,8638489,0,0,alttab,,,"Maybe not for everyone. I find myself alone amongst many because I hate tools. The need for a tool means there is some problem that has to be solved. For instance, I much prefer languages that don&#x27;t necessitate an IDE. I&#x27;d much rather program in Ruby, Python, Javascript, or anything else I can do competently in vi, with a 5 line .vimrc file. Even when in vi I only use like 5 commands. I find other ways to be effective. I can boot up Eclipse or IntelliJ or whatever and get the job done, but certainly there has to be a better way?<p>I installed Chrome because its fast. I liked it for web development because it had &quot;Firebug&quot; essentially built in. I eventually peeked back at Firefox to see if was doing anything interesting on the development side, but by that point much preferred the overall speed and simplicity of Chrome that I simply haven&#x27;t bothered to go back.<p>Compared to IE, developing for both platforms rarely requires you to even check Firefox for correctness or performance once you get around the quirks or use more recently developed JS libraries.<p>I think the only extension I installed for Chrome was TamperMonkey. And a couple of things developed for work purposes.",1416543086

8639771,comment,8639317,8639707,0,0,gnufied,,,"from same article:<p>&quot;Apparently GDM 3.8 assumes that an init system will also clean up any processes it started. This is what systemd does, but OpenRC didn’t support that. Which means that GDM under OpenRC would leave lingering processes around, making it impossible to restart/shutdown GDM properly. The Gentoo GNOME packagers had to add this ability to OpenRC themselves. Then there were various other small little bugs, details which I already forgot and cannot be bothered to read the IRC logs. &quot;<p>So apparently there are bugs when using OpenRC with Gnome. That is not to say, Gnome requires systemd (I did not make that claim).",1416542967

Either you are using Fedora, where software is usually just frozen bleeding edge circa Manjaro, where breakage does happen and that cannot be accepted in production, or you are running upwards of 5 year old versions of software.<p>The Ubuntu LTS cycle is just an optimal compromise in my book. You even get Debian Testing as a good rolling release, Debian Stable as a great server release, Ubuntu Server as an enterprise option, and they all (soon) will be using a common core.<p>For now I advocate the SUSE&#x27;s, but while it has been stable the general obscurity of it and the dwindling userbase and the fact Novel (I know they have also since sold SUSE) backed out of maintaining OpenSUSE directly, I can&#x27;t be confident in its future.

Linux (and also PGP) is just too much of a cultural shift for most people. I mean even a security conscious guy like Glen Greenwald didn&#x27;t even bother to learn PGP or Live CD usage in the first few months of Snowden reaching out to him.<p>It is a gap in capability that many of us (including Danny at EFF) are working on day and night to try and bridge though!",1416542825

If that average of #2342 was actually 95% of them getting insurance for #300 and then 5% super-dangerous teens who're charged #40000 each, only the latter will take you up, and you'll pay out a lot on their claims.<p>All that said, I do hope you find a way to make it work.

I will be a Xoogler as of about 2pm today, so you could say my opinion is at least fresh.<p>Google is an awesome place, and huge opportunities will open up for you if you do accept the offer. Google is still very highly respected and has a great internal culture. There is very little bureaucracy and a lot of autonomy allowed.  My life basically completely changed (for the better) after joining and I'm a way better developer than I was 2 years ago. You can also read Steve Yegge's recent G+ posts about what he thinks of Google - I would say I am about 80% as enthusiastic about it as him ;)<p>The one thing I will say is that the team you're on matters. Google still has the great ""don't be evil"" policy which permeates throughout the company, but the teams are free to organize how they want.  If you're into TDD and pairing, you may find a team that is into that and have a great time, or find a team who hates it and not. Google is big enough that there are teams doing things very differently. The good thing is that you CAN change teams, and there is an internal application that lets you do just that. It's not really that hard.<p>If you are deciding between Google and the other big SV players like Facebook, Twitter, etc, then I would just pick the company that seems to fit with your personality the best.",1346427913

Pike's point is that these objections were in hindsight inevitable, because the whole idea behind Go is to simplify the language --- Go is even simpler than ANSI C.<p>The Go team's idea was, look at languages like C++ and replace groups of individual features with orthogonal components that can be composed to similar effect.<p>Pike is a little dismissive of C++, as am I, but ultimately he acknowledges the truth of the matter: if you're dead set on writing programs using template generics and inheritance hierarchies, you're going to stick with C++. And that's OK. We don't need to argue about it.<p>I am very new to Go, have a background in C/C++, am Ruby today, and was Python from '02-'05. My take is that there are definitely still things I would write in C, and I would still write web frontend code in Ruby.

4460065,comment,4459131,4459397,11,0,mschaef,,,"> My choice of implementation would be to pass a discriminator function which takes an error and returns true if the error is recoverable.<p>Conditions are close to exactly that + syntactic sugar.<p>`handler-bind` lets you establish a dynamic scope, inside of which specific functions are called when specific conditions are signaled. Signaling a condition = call the first handler function in the list that handles the signaled condition. The handler is called <i>before the stack is unwound</i>, which allows it to elect to either `throw`, invoke a restart, or ignore the condition entirely.<p>This is in contrast to exceptions in (say) Java. `throw new FooException()` does a lot of potentially destructive work before control gets transfered to the exception handler: It allocates an exception object, which fully captures the current thread's stack. (It's not too common, but this can be bypassed, if you don't throw a <i>new</i> exception object...) It unwinds the stack to the frame that has a matching `catch`.<p>Only after those two things have happened does the exception handler get a chance to decide how to proceed, and at that point, it's too late for many recovery strategies. Conditions help this by making it easier to intercept the process earlier.<p>Where they hurt is that they add another level of complexity to API design. With Java style exceptions, if the function fails, it fails completely. There's a convenient simplicity to that. With Lisp style conditions and restarts, A function will let you know how things are going as it does its work and then give you the opportunity to change its behavior midstream. It's a lot more work to design that kind of API, and it's probably well past the point of diminishing returns for most kinds of development.",1346426510

I took a part time job in applied math and computing on some US DoD problems -- hush, hush stuff.  We had two Fortran programmers using IBM's MVS TSO, and in the past 12 months they had spent $80 K.  We wanted to save money and also do much more computing.  We went shopping and bought a $120 K Prime (really, essentially a baby Multics).<p>Soon I inherited the system and ran it in addition to programming it, doing applied math, etc.  When I got my Ph.D., soon I was a prof in a B-school.  They had an MVS system with punched cards, a new MBA program, and wanted better computing for the MBA program.  I wanted TeX or at least something to drive a daisy wheel printer.  Bummer.<p>At a faculty meeting the college computing committee gave a sad report on options for better computing.  I stood and said:  ""Why don't we get a machine such as can be had for about $5000 a month, put it in a room in the basement, and do it ourselves?"".  Soon the operational Dean wanted more info, and I lead a one person selection committee.  I looked at DG as in ""Soul of a New Machine', DEC VAX PDP 11/780, and a Prime.<p>The long sitting head of the central university computer center went to the Dean and said that my proposal would not work.  I got a sudden call to come to the Dean's office and met the critic.  I happened to bring a cubic foot or so of technical papers related to my computer shopping.  I'd specified enough ordinary, inexpensive 'comfort' A/C to handle the heat, but the critic claimed that the hard disk drives needed tight temperature and humidity control or  would fail.  I said:  ""These disk drives are sold by Prime but they are actually manufactured by Control Data.  I happen to have with me the official engineering specifications for these drives directly from Control Data."".  So I read them the temperature and humidity specifications that we could easily meet.  The critic still claimed the disks would fail.  Then I explained that at my earlier site, we had no A/C at all.  By summer the room got too warm for humans, so we put an electric van in the doorway.  Later we had an A/C evaporator hung off the ceiling.  Worked fine for three years.  The Dean sided with me.<p>In the end we got a Prime.  What we got was a near exact copy of what I had run in grad school, down to the terminals and the Belden general purpose 5 conductor signal cable used to connect the terminals at 9600 bps.  The system became the world site for TeX on Prime, lasted 15 years, and was a great success.  The system was running one year after that faculty meeting.  I was made Chair of the college computer committee.<p>That faculty meeting had been only two weeks after I had arrived on campus.  There was one big, huge reason my planning was accepted:  I'd been there, done that, and gotten the T-shirt.  That is, in contradiction to the article, what mattered was actual, prior accomplishment, not 'potential'.<p>Why the industrial psychological researchers came to their conclusions I don't know, but I don't believe their conclusions.",1346425259

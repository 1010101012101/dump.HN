I thought it would be nice to highlight another founder's startup as well.<p>To explain, the original title of the post was ""Duck Duck Go makes Time Magazine's top 50 sites of the year""<p>Personally, I feel that Gabriel contributes more to HN content and startup culture than the AirBnb, Hipmunk or Instapaper founders combined.  And, that's not to detract at all from the great work those other startups have done.<p>The reason that I highlighted Duck Duck Go,and Gabriel, was because he in particular, has done something amazing:  he's boot strapped a search engine essentially by himself to 8M unique searches a month.<p>He's also taken things like search privacy, and tithing revenues to Open Source projects, and brought them to the forefront of discussion.  His blog also has a _ton of great content on it, especially his series on traction is amazing.<p>The original title got 10 votes in the first 5 minutes after I posted it.  That Duck Duck Go doesn't get some of the kudos they have coming to them is disappointing.<p></rant>",1313575174

2894715,comment,2894658,2894658,95,0,thaumaturgy,,,"I've been thinking about this lately, too. A long time ago, I spent almost no time on the internet, because there wasn't really much of an internet to speak of. Instead, I wrote code. Lots, and lots, and lots of code. Some of it in assembly; some of it, even, in hex, with tons of printed pages of processor instructions in front of me.<p>Feats like that required a level of concentration that I find almost impossible to achieve today. I've developed a tic: write a line of code, check a news site; write another line of code, check email; write another line of code, check a social site.<p>I can't even call it procrastination anymore. It's something far more insidious. I'm fighting it, but the fight itself requires a nearly exhausting amount of effort.<p>It's got all the hallmarks of an addiction -- a psychological one, rather than a chemical one, maybe. The trouble is, with many addictive substances, completely avoiding them is a reasonable solution. With the internet, looking up a function reference or even testing and uploading a piece of code can lead too easily to diversions; it's difficult to separate necessary things from distractions and impractical to avoid it altogether.<p>I hate it. I've tried many of the tricks that people suggest, but the simple fact is, a significant part of my personality would rather mindlessly browse the internet instead of focusing intently for a long enough period of time to do something productive.<p>> <i>This leads me to believe that the ideas we have reflect the kind of world we live in.</i><p>I think this is insightful. I somehow never managed to lose track of my childhood dreams, but instead I'm constantly preventing myself from accomplishing them.<p>Good luck on your internet diet. If you manage to stick with it for a full month, you're a better person than I am.",1313574685

People in the first world have problems. Solving them is anything but a waste.<p>Every time you bring civilization a little step further through technology, you inevitably end up helping those who work hard at what you consider worthy problems.

For example, road block adverts (like when an entire page is taken over with an advert saying ""your content will load in x seconds"") are genuinely annoying, a sponsored site skin is (unless it's implemented/designed badly) not, because while people might see it and mutter to themselves, it doesn't actually harm their use of the site at all, and it's not nearly annoying enough to make them leave the site.<p>Interestingly, on one of my company's websites (our entire business is based around advertising), we had discussed the possibility of doing things like this and decided against it, on the logic that even though we wouldn't directly drive away users, in the long run it might contribute to their not liking the site as much. However after various pieces of user feedback, we ended up doing just this for galleries that our journalists take at events, now each image loads a new page cleanly, (giving new banner impressions), and feedback since we made that change has matched the suggestions we had beforehand: our readers actually prefer it.",1313572138

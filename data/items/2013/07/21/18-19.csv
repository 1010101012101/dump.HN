6079822,comment,6079326,6079326,6,0,ChuckMcM,,,"Holy flashback! I was sitting in Sun trying to explain why the next version of NFS could not be a &#x27;pay&#x27; version to SunSoft leadership, and then President Ed Zander said &quot;Chuck, look how many people use NFS, if we got $10 for only 10% of the seats out there we&#x27;d fund this company on that.&quot; To which I replied, &quot;If you charge $10 then 10% of the seats will be 0 since there will be no seats.&quot;<p>This is the paradox of &quot;infrastructure&quot; services. Today the telephone is an amazing thing. But their value is tied up in the network effect (other people have them so you can use them to call). If nobody has a phone, you buying one has little value, if everyone has a phone then you want one because you can talk to everyone you know.<p>So Facebook is &#x27;cool&#x27; when everyone you know has a presence there, it is &#x27;not cool&#x27; when you don&#x27;t know anyone there. Charging a subscription now, is not plausible, people will leave. Instead you need to sell entire groups and then charge <i>them</i> a subscription fee. Fortunately we have a really great example of someone doing exactly that, it was called Yammer. Put everyone in your business on Yammer (it felt like they just changed the CSS assets in the Facebook code, seriously) and increase connectivity and communication in your team. Instant value proposition if everyone in the company is using it. So you sell a subscription to the company and boom, done.<p>Now if you wanted to create Facebook for Enterprise to compete with Yammer, that might be interesting, and to bake in the notion of &quot;Enterprise&quot; presence and &quot;Non Business&quot; presence into the same user account, that would generate revenue. And if you told people, &quot;if your company signs up for Facebook for Enterprises you&#x27;re personal account will also be ad free and have these additional features ....&quot; then you can create &#x27;pull&#x27; where people actually want to lobby for it inside.<p>But just doing a subscription model probably won&#x27;t work.",1374433121
6079821,comment,6078023,6078881,3,0,fbuilesv,,,"> <i>Crush chaos and entropy through decoupled design, through APIs that are simple and affordant, crush chaos by making it everyone&#x27;s job to make the whole simpler.</i><p>The author and yourself are talking about entirely different things. Decoupled design and APIs won&#x27;t help you manage tens or hundreds of developers, it won&#x27;t help you guide a team towards the same goal. It also won&#x27;t help as a communication buffer between all the different areas/developers. This is where the PM comes in. The author&#x27;s thinking _above_ the code level. With his 105 developers, even if they&#x27;re all producing amazing software, you still need to setup a comm. and product guidance machinery [0].<p>> <i>Don&#x27;t add people who cannot code and hope they will improve things.</i><p>I&#x27;m sorry to nitpick this specific phrase from your comment but a lot of people has expressed this &quot;people who can&#x27;t add code won&#x27;t add value&quot; thinking. The reality is that the author never mentioned bringing non developers to do the job (but from the comments on this thread it seems this has been a recurring theme for many people).<p>Speaking from my own experience, the best PMs almost always started as developers. You don&#x27;t have to bring an outsider with no technical knowledge, you can just find the right team member who&#x27;s already starting to take over this and then make it &quot;official&quot;.<p>This prevailing &quot;but he can&#x27;t code&quot; ideation shows that most people&#x27;s experiences with PMs has been bad and us developers bring it up because code is where we excel, it&#x27;s what we can understand and fix. The reality is that if the PM failed to do his job correctly it was most likely not related to his coding skills (but again, we frame it in terms of what we understand, code).<p>[0] Keep in mind that this does not mean you need to add more layers to your company structure. Empowering current employees seems to be working just fine for companies like Valve and GitHub.",1374433107

If this means taking the ES* syntax wholesale, that&#x27;s fine. If it means minting a new (and hopefully, but arguably, nicer) syntax, that&#x27;s fine too. And if it means breaking backwards compatibility, that&#x27;s also alright, as the compiled lowest-common-denominator JS output will still be perfectly compatible with the new stuff.",1374431386

Four broad, obvious possibilities:<p>(1) More people are taking greater liberties with government secrets in 2013 than they did in, say, 2004.<p>(2) The government is creating more &quot;secrets&quot;, justifiably or not, and thus putting more people into contact with secrecy and creating a greater risk.<p>(3) The Obama administration is working more diligently to monitor the handling of secret information, so that leaks that wouldn&#x27;t even have been detected in 2004 now are.<p>(4) The Obama administration has a more punitive attitude towards leakers, so that leaks that would have resulted in a slap on the wrist in 2004 now produce criminal prosecution.<p>All four can be true.<p>Also, I think it&#x27;s important to bear in mind that our sympathies with specific cases (best example: Bradley Manning) aren&#x27;t dispositive. It is simultaneously possible for someone to have done something for the greater good --- and even for that thing to have achieved the greater good --- and still have that act merit criminal prosecution. This gets to the issue of &quot;rule of law, not of men&quot;, and requires you to consider that your definition of &quot;the greater good&quot; can differ sharply with definitions of other people; consider, for instance, my zealously pro-life Catholic aunts, or the militia movement.<p>Relatedly: it&#x27;s important to understand that supporting a prosecution doesn&#x27;t demand support for conviction; it can simply mean that one believes something more formal and &quot;accountable&quot; than the discretion of officials combined with public sentiment should govern the acceptability of a breach of trust with the USG.<p>Looking at the list of cases I presented:<p>* Three of the cases (Liebowitz, Sterling, Kim) don&#x27;t involve terrorist threats on the US, but rather foreign policy and counterproliferation. Leaks of actual active foreign intelligence might demand a stricter review standard.<p>* Two of the cases (Snowden and Manning) were so monumentally huge that there may have been no possible outcome other than a court case of some sort.<p>That leaves Drake and Kiriakou. I read the FAS archive of filings on Kiriakou and came away thinking that, regardless of my extremely negative feelings about CIA-run interrogations in the Middle East, his prosecution wasn&#x27;t egregious: <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5796162"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5796162</a><p>Drake, I don&#x27;t know.<p>My personal guess as to ranked order of the 4 factors above: (3), (1), (4), (2).",1374429905

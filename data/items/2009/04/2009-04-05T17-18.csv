547540,comment,547483,547511,0,0,cia_plant,,,"Among historians, ""revisionism"" is not a loaded word - it just means a challenge to the common theories about a time period. The term is tarnished outside the field because the most visible revisionists are simply denying well-documented historical facts for political reasons (e.g., the holocaust, the rape of Nanking, etc.)",1238953839
547539,comment,547256,547332,0,0,DougBTX,,,"> or faster than using document.getElementById<p>The bit to explain is that Ext.fly (and jQuery() for that matter) don't return actual DOM elements like document.getElementById does. Instead they return a Javascript object which you can use to interact with the DOM element(s) using a different API.<p>Both are probably slower than document.getElementById, but allow you to program at a higher level of abstraction. For example, jQuery("".foo"").someMethod() could act on many DOM elements, but document.getElementById().someMethod() can only act on one.",1238953836

Antenna placement in cell phones is a high art, and when you consider a modern phone supports a huge number of frequencies and protocols in which it has to be efficient, well, it's an incredibly hard problem to solve.<p>Motorola, for all their recent problems, likely understands this better than Apple, with some 2 basic phone models under their belts.<p>Modern pcs have this problem too.

In other word, economic is still in its infancy.<p>However, I have to say that the interpretation of the new deals actually goes all the way before the great depression.<p>You have economicsts like Ludwig von Mises and Friedrich Hayek warning of a major economic crisis before the stock market crash of 1929.<p>If there is any economic school I am willing to bet on, it is the Austrian School of Economics. After all, those who are of the Austrian tradition correctly predicted the current housing crisis, now. Their preceddesors predicted the Great depression.",1238952841

It's also easier to start using (you just take it out of your pocker). This convenience means you can use it when you couldn't be bothered using a laptop. I don't know the reasons people prefer the iPhone over similar class of devices (blackberry, other phones), but they do.<p>It reminds me of Alan Kay's ""Of course, you can do all those things on the mainframe, but [the minicomputer/microcomputer] is for all the extra things you can do that you wouldn't think of doing on the mainframe."" <a href=""http://ecotopia.com/webpress/futures.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ecotopia.com/webpress/futures.htm</a>",1238952480

Optimising for something that won't be used can be a terrible waste of time.<p>For example, I recall a niche site that dealt with antiques - People could list their antiques for sale in a nice searchable 'craigslist' style site. They also included a separate url that showed only the antiques for sale by a single user, it was more of an afterthought than a core feature.<p>The 'abuse' came when users, especially antique shops, starting using these as their actual sites. In a time when getting a presence on the internet was an arduous deal (hire a developer, hosting, domain name etc.) It turned out that the real interest of the site wasn't searchable antiques, but rather as a very simple method of creating an antiques focused minisite.<p>Unfortunatey I don't recall the url.",1238952425

I'd concede that.<p>But that is comfortably offset by the advantages you gain from seeing through the syntax to the language concepts. It is not even the correct question to ask really. Because mastering of a language might be a secondary goal.<p>A more interesting question might be: do I know at all which language I should strive to master?

After their luck at getting the CP/M version of WordStar running on the PC, they could not seem to get an updated version out the door. They decided instead that they would produce an entirely new product, one which was easier to maintain and improve than the original version.<p>Luckily for us, the new WordStar, introduced at COMDEX as WordStar 2000, was entirely different from the old product. Micropro intentionally attempted to replace their market leader with a product that was bigger and slower and used a different interface. Although it was not obvious at COMDEX, the product was doomed from the start. In spite of all the product hype and the size and beauty of the Micropro booth and presentation, the new product did not stand a chance.<p>Micropro did more for us at that show than we could ever have done for ourselves. They convinced their customers that the old WordStar was not very good and that they needed to look for something better. Not only would these customers take a look at WordStar 2000, but they would also look at WordPerfect 4.0.""",1238951850

8131482,comment,8131116,8131116,2,0,Silhouette,,,"I also vote for maybe 5-6 hours on average.<p>That&#x27;s &quot;active&quot; programming time, meaning things like designing with software tools or pen/paper, literal programming time where I&#x27;m bashing on a keyboard and compiling stuff, and immediate testing activities.<p>I&#x27;m not including things like time for running automated testing suites, making general notes, or overheads like calls, meetings, and reviewing specs. I don&#x27;t find these activities detract from my concentration on detailed technical tasks in most cases.<p>I&#x27;ve noticed that if something really grabs my attention -- maybe because it&#x27;s a very interesting part of the system or maybe because it&#x27;s an urgent bug fix or a huge deal is riding on it for my client -- I can do detailed technical work for considerably longer without suffering a drop in either equality or productivity, but these are exceptional cases and in short bursts for maybe a day or two at a time. It&#x27;s not a level I can sustain for multiple weeks.<p>(Edit: To answer the question about contracts, if I&#x27;m billing on a time and materials basis then my contractual wording normally says I can bill the daily rate for any date on which services are provided, without reference to how exactly I will provided the services or any specific hours or number of hours. Sometimes this raises eyebrows when people first see it, usually if they are used to working with other people who bill by the hour. However, my experience has been that no serious prospect objects to the point of losing a deal over it, nor has it created any lack of trust or bad feeling once a client sees how it really works. In practice, I sometimes work only a couple of hours in a day because something has been held up on my client&#x27;s end, and I think my record was something like an 18 hour day involving significant travel, and I would charge the same for both. At some point you just have to be sensible about these things and trust that it will work out fairly overall.)",1407156491

But I do know that there are a awful lot of English translations, done by well-meaning people, which vary from mediocre to Godawful. Almost every anime subtitling job I&#x27;ve ever seen is at the very least somewhat stilted and awkward to my ear. (Though they&#x27;re still better than the dubs.) And a lot of it comes down to native English speakers who fear losing the intended nuances of the original and so do a rigidly literal translation, because they think that&#x27;s the &quot;most accurate.&quot;<p>So the problem isn&#x27;t nitpicking; it&#x27;s the <i>wrong kind</i> of nitpicking.

Everybody commenting here is describing their perception of these numbers.<p>However, the data really is deceptive.  You cannot draw any conclusions whatsoever from this data alone, unfortunately.  What conclusions are being drawn that are valid are actually drawing upon extra information about the countries concerned.  For example:<p>> The median income is often closer to what most people actually earn than the mean for example<p>It&#x27;s not really important what &quot;most people earn&quot;. Take South Africa, 3rd on the list in this chart. This is a country with a 25.2% unemployment rate and significant income inequality [1]. The median income listed is $6,600. If you&#x27;re interested in technology - good luck programming Casio digital watches, because that&#x27;s all you&#x27;re going to be able to afford. Even when do you save up to afford things, you die sooner than the rest of the world so you don&#x27;t even get to enjoy it for long [2].<p>What&#x27;s important is what kind of quality of life you want, and whether or not the income you earn in your chosen profession can provide for that.  Over and above that are cross-cutting concerns, for instance, do you really want to live in a country with a higher homicide rate than Colombia and significant corruption?

They do not impose an opinion about how to interpret the data. what I&#x27;m saying is it would be great if there were a way to factor all the data in together in a way that allows people to specify preferences (e.g. homicide rate < 10) to determine a personalised quality of life score.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.bloomberg.com/visual-data/best-and-worst/most-stressed-out-countries"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.bloomberg.com/visual-data/best-and-worst/most-str...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.bloomberg.com/visual-data/best-and-worst/longest-life-span-in-middle-east-and-africa-countries"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.bloomberg.com/visual-data/best-and-worst/longest-...</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://www.bloomberg.com/visual-data/best-and-worst/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.bloomberg.com/visual-data/best-and-worst/</a>",1407154093

The best you will be able to do is to speculate that one might have been Deist a very long time ago. According to these surveys, an atheist simply could not be elected President today. Christians occupy most political offices, so they cannot plausibly claim to lack political representation.<p>Rank and file Christians are just ordinary people, but they are manipulated by politicians and political preachers to believe they are being persecuted, that there is a War on Christmas, that Sharia will rule over them in their towns, etc. and that they must claim ever greater control of society in order to protect Christianity. Of course this means they should donate money to certain organizations, vote for certain candidates and silence religious minorities.<p>It also extends to more militant means. Nobody wants to discuss this in polite company, because it&#x27;s unsettling and it makes many Christians angry and defensive, but a certain number of followers will respond violently, as in the case of abortion clinic bombers who are encouraged to escape from law enforcement, or men who are widely though quietly praised for shooting up a Unitarian church during Sunday morning service. I could go on. This isn&#x27;t a majority of Christians, but the violence feeds on that substantial supporting population, and it relates to the way many Christians have been politically manipulated into hate.<p>Several recent popular movies present near future scenarios where Christians are systematically persecuted by non-Christians. Convincing people of this kind of falsehood is essential to building hate. This is widely seen as a plausible scenario, despite the fact that the majority of the country identifies as Christian and a disproportionate majority of our politicians identify as Christian. When you assume that this is reality, it feels more justified to infringe on others&#x27; constitutional rights and even to harm them. Whether you want to admit it or not, this is the same mechanism used to justify violence against Jews in Weimar Germany.<p>If Christianity is a religion of love and tolerance rather than hate and intolerance, then Christians should at least respect the Constitutional rights of religious minorities, including atheists, even if they disagree with them. A few denominations have good records for this, while others do not. But the former are quiet, and the latter control the drift of Christian politics in the US, which is to attack religious minorities and insist on absolute Christian supremacy as if it were a condition of survival.",1407154004

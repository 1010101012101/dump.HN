The problem with Python is that there is no syntax for assigning to variables declared in an arbitrary scope, because there are no explicit declarations. As far as I understand, implicit local variables are what causes the problems in Python, not anything about closures, really.

Attached is a graphic of what a rigged, backstopped and manipulated market is all about. The chart demonstrates Goldman's YTD trading track record: out of 194 trading days in 2009, the firm has made over $100 million on 116 occasions! This alone accounts for $11.6 billion in revenue (and is likely much more as Goldman could have easily had a $1 billion trading day in the rightmost bracket as it is open ended).

But I don't apologize for that, nor do I regret it. I'm a designer and an entrepreneur. I'm passionate about great user experiences. I think fighting for great user experiences from companies is a good thing. What is passion if you don't fight for what you love?<p>We're on the cusp of a changing society. Customer experience is becoming, in a very literal way, the brand of a company. And when I come across companies so clueless that they won't spend 50k to hire a design firm to design their online identity/experience, I can't help but wonder what kind of negative effect that has on the evolution of the internet and on customer experience design as an industry.<p>Fixing AA.com would be [strike]ridiculously[/strike] relatively cheap and simple, especially if it was just a new skin based on the logic they already have built (even though there are serious flaws there as well). Yet the company has not done this. It hasn't even hinted at this, and it fired the one guy who seemed to care about it in the organization. This is a management problem, not a design problem. When I mention this, and when I call out the CEO specifically, people call me arrogant, young, naive, and stupid. But I honestly believe the fault for a failing like this, a failing so visceral that it affects the image of the entire company in the eyes of its customers, rests solely in lap of the CEO.<p>American Airlines is no doubt a terrible company, and not just from a design perspective.

A few things of note (that have come up in these comments):<p>The $99/yr is meant to be a nominal fee to keep out the riff-raff, basically (my metaphor, not Joel's).  SO will charge the hiring companies a much larger amount to get the opportunity to search the database.<p>It seems like this was actually designed more from the perspective of the person who is HIRING, not the person being hired.  Joel mentions the frustrations of sorting through a zillion resumes, many of them from people who are wildly out of their league, and the reality that even a good resume doesn't really prove that the person is a good coder.  Two people with identical backgrounds might have wildly different qualities as developers.  Looking at resumes isn't enough.<p>So the $99/yr is a deliberate barrier to entry to reduce spam, and your Stack Overflow rep/answers are a second way to distinguish the quality of developers.<p>The grand unifying theory that makes it work (if it does work) is that developers want to work for the kind of company that takes enough care to look at SO answers in order to distinguish great devs from mediocre ones.  That's why you would want to pay the $99 bucks just to have your resume searchable there.  In theory.<p>Also, as a deliberate, specific method to prevent recruiters from using the database, you're required to give the name of the company that is hiring in order to search the database.  Recruiters won't do this since the dev could skip the recruiter and go straight to the company, in which case the recruiter can't get their commission.",1257463455

Anyone can crank out a clean design in a few hours when they're working with no specs, business goals, market research, investors or actual customers to answer to.

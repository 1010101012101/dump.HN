9098789,comment,9097404,9098650,0,0,chimeracoder,,,"> There are alternate compilers for Go, in the form of gccgo and llgo. But those are both very slow to build (compared to the Go tree that takes ~30s to build the compiler, linker, assembler and standard library).<p>For any non-Gophers reading this: I write Go as my primary language, and have for the past two and a half years. I just timed the respective compilation speeds on a handful of my larger projects using both gc and gccgo (and tested on a separate computer as well just for kicks).<p>gccgo was marginally slower, though not enough to be appreciable. In the case of two projects, gccgo was actually slightly faster. The Go compiler/linker/assembler/stdlib are probably larger and more complex than the most complex project on my local machine at the moment, but I think my projects are a reasonable barometer of what a typical Go programmer might expect to work with (as opposed to someone working on the Go language itself).<p>The more pressing issue as far as I&#x27;m concerned is that gccgo is on a different release schedule than gc (because it ships with the rest of the gcc collection). That&#x27;s not to say it&#x27;s not worth optimizing either compiler further when it comes to compilation speed, but it&#x27;s important for people considering the two compilers to understand the sense of scale we&#x27;re talking about - literally less than a second for most of my projects. Literally, the time it takes you to type &#x27;go build&#x27; is probably more significant.",1424753672

No regrets. I know some of the qualities of successful academics, and I don&#x27;t possess them. I do enjoy being involved in making things.<p>And it was 20+ years ago, when there was maybe a bit more migration between physics and engineering, and not so damn many specialized tools to learn.<p>They say &quot;luck is the residue of design,&quot; but I sure owe a lot to pure luck. I was graduating into a rotten job market, but got my first job through a friend-of-a-friend sort of deal. It was a small company where a jack of all trades could be of value, though the pay wasn&#x27;t great. When things began looking better job-market-wise, my spouse and I moved to a new town.<p>I actually did teach a couple of courses as an adjunct during a brief period of unemployment. It was hard work because I was doing it for the first time. Now I&#x27;m back in industry, doing a sort of systems architect thing for a company that makes measurement equipment.<p>As for entrepreneurship, yes, I have a very small side-business making an electronic gadget, but it is for a very specialized and mature market, so it&#x27;s not start-up material. The good thing is that I&#x27;ve actually learned a lot about running a small business.<p>The biggest, and perhaps only, barrier to me starting a start-up is that I don&#x27;t have a good idea.

I&#x27;m sure there were plenty of skateboarding companies that tried to stick with the old style and simply went out of business.  Things change, you can&#x27;t always blame somebody when they do.<p>On Enjoi: you have to take things in context and even a casual glance at their ads makes it clear they trend towards the offensive and absurd for the sake of being offensive and absurd.  They also joke about pooping their pants but I don&#x27;t think they&#x27;re trying to advocate for it.<p>On Hubba: a wheel company I&#x27;ve never heard of that doesn&#x27;t have a wheel on Amazon&#x27;s 100 best selling skateboarding wheels list and only has one set of bearings on Amazon&#x27;s 100 best selling bearings.

If you watch five minutes of girls and five minutes of guys skateboarding at the XGames you&#x27;ll realize the girls skate differently, they have a different posture and a totally different style but not really in a good way.

I think she makes some good points, but awkwardly uses skating culture and its change to drive her points across.<p>Mainly, marketing, and marketing targeting has had a huge negative effect on society.  There has been good, and there has been bad, but more bad than good.  With targeted marketing, you get this kind of thing where advertisers go for the jugular on their core market, abusively ignoring the side-effects.  So you have them marketing violence and counterculture to boys and pink-love-mother-earth to girls.  On the other hand, they get to market narrow markets like fish sauce to SE Asians, and Vegemite to Commonwealthers, for example.  So, while it&#x27;s nice that this makes an Aussie feel at home, or a Thai feel like they are part of the social fabric, on the whole, targeted marketing can have a stratifying effect, it amplifies the differences and you can end up with unrecognizable monsters like the ones where sexism is used to sell products, or shape the youth (to drink sugary drinks).  The alternative would be bland marketing which necessarily would have to appeal to the mainstream, which also has its drawbacks.  but on the whole?<p>But back to sexism in the workplace.  It would be nice, in thought, for there to be a more or less even distribution, of people in the different industries, and we can try, but, in the end, I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s going to happen any time soon.  There are too many social aspects which go into this, from social behavior, to individual behavior.  Maybe a start would be for people not to feel that some jobs have more cachet than others.  That there be no such thing as cliqueishness and clubbism, tribalism.  That people didn&#x27;t recruit from their pool of friends --and this happens anywhere from Facebook, to Carwashes, to Airport personnel, to professorships, to ethnic restaurants.

Not to mention the fact that young people don&#x27;t watch the news (the State of the Media report in 2014 said that the average age of the evening news watcher was 53) [1].

I think at the end of the day citizen journalism and fact-checking (allowing more participation from non-paid parties) can not only produce higher quality journalism, but can actually save the news from its monetization woes. (In other words, our thesis is that instead of trying to squeeze more out of the monetization end as a result of increase in supply, we should just let that increase in supply decrease the value of each printed word). Basically we&#x27;re trying to create an open Wikipedia-like newsroom where anyone can curate and fact-check in real-time.

9098603,comment,9097404,9098562,0,0,humbledrone,,,"My understanding is that they wrote code that translated the C code for the original Go compiler into Go code. This translation wasn&#x27;t fully general -- it made assumptions about how the C code was written -- but it allowed the port from C to Go to be very precise (i.e. bug for bug). So now that the Go compiler written in Go can compile Go, that&#x27;s what they&#x27;ll use going forward, and they will slowly work to make it into more idiomatic Go instead of machine-generated Go.<p>So to answer your question, this new Go-written-in-Go compiler will initially be compiled by the Go-written-in-C compiler. The output from that will be an executable Go-written-in-Go compiler, and _that_ will be used to compile itself in the future. I.e. Go compiler version 1.4 will be used to compile Go version 1.5 will be used to compile Go version 1.6...<p>Keep in mind that this is not at all unusual. The C compiler GCC has been compiled using older versions of GCC for a long time. Having a compiler compile itself is a sort of milestone that many languages aspire to as a way of showing that the language is &quot;ready.&quot;",1424750429

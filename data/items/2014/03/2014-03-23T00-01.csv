7451591,comment,7449728,7449728,3,0,zaporozhets,,,"I&#x27;m 19 and living in Sydney, Australia.<p>I ignored High School and taught myself javascript and web standards instead from about the age of 12. During this time I also did 8 years of ballet, contemporary and jazz dancing. I also played the guitar and double bass semi-professionally and I sang in a Cathedral Choir ( even sang for the pope a couple of times even though I am 0% religious ). I also travelled across most of Europe and Asia ( it helps that I speak fluent Ukrainian and Russian ). I did a bit of freelance when I was about 16 for a couple of places. This experience was probably the most valuable part of my career to date. Learning how to pitch work to someone that doesn&#x27;t know you, learning how to manage your own time correctly and learning how to talk the client speak are things that restrict many developers later on ( i&#x27;ve found ).<p>I started work a week before my HighSchool final exams were over as a full-time junior front-end Developer for a small agency that was quite far from where I lived at the time. I think it was particularly good for me since they had a wonderful culture and though my title was &#x27;junior front-end&#x27; I was actually the only developer there that knew anything about front-end and I was able to plunge into the deep-end with every project, and really own the front-end. I also learnt to work closely with designers and really care for that relationship there. Another thing that is so often missing.<p>Interestingly enough, that agency ended up firing everyone and doing something new about 7 months after I started which sucked ( I was absolutely gutted at the time ). Luckily, I had built a pretty good portfolio there of work where I could point at the front-end and say &#x27;that was all me&#x27;. I ended up applying for about 5 different places that I particularly liked.<p>The first place I interviewed at was actually wonderful. Great culture, reasonable expectations and a great work ethic and care for perfection ( this was my ultimate need ). Funnily enough, they liked me just as much; so much so in fact that they hired me in the interview to start the next day as a contractor until they got all of the documents in order to make me full time.<p>3 months in, I changed a bit as a person. Still very much a developer in mentality, I felt closed off from the decision making process and a lot like I was just a &#x27;resource&#x27; rather than a person with ideas. The agency was in a &#x27;transitional&#x27; period and the corporate side struggled with integrating properly with the newly acquired &#x27;dev&#x27; side. Anyway, after 3 months I decided I needed to change something. I stopped being a developer and began working there as a &#x27;Creative&#x27; ( this is still my position there ). This was actually pretty great since I have a great passion for marketing as I do for development. In this role I my main duty is as a &#x27;concept&#x27; resource in regards to big integrated campaigns. I spend most of my time researching and writing up ways that the dev side can be best applied to the corp. side or drawing up concept art for products or ideas.. It&#x27;s a pretty fun gig. Aside from this I do a bunch of random sub-contractor work for different people. This allows me to continue flexing my dev side which I feel is just as important as everything else.<p>It&#x27;s hard to say i&#x27;ve been that successful yet, because I still have so much I feel I need to do; but it&#x27;s definitely liberating earning a good $80k AUD at 19 after everyone told me that I wouldn&#x27;t be able to do anything with my life unless I went to uni.<p>I am also working on a product in my other spare time ( if it even exists ) that I know actually has a market. Trying to figure out if I want to drop everything and pursue it or possibly even license it and raise some funding and employ someone to build it for me. Tough decisions.<p>Down the road, I will build an Agency that bridges the gap between digital innovation and the needs of Ad/Marketing Agencies ( I have a huge underlying passion for this ).",1395535990

7451587,comment,7450140,7450681,2,0,dragonwriter,,,"> It is kind of shocking to me that the state isn&#x27;t liable for defendants&#x27; legal fees in the face of an acquittal. If I sue someone in civil court on frivolous grounds, they can countersue me yet no parallel exists in the criminal realm.<p>That&#x27;s...not really true. First, plaintiffs aren&#x27;t generally liable for respondents costs in a civil suit if the plaintiff loses, so the idea that the fact that prosecuting authorities aren&#x27;t responsible for defendants costs whenever the defendant is acquitted in a criminal case is unexpected given the civil parallel is bizarre.<p>Second, while it is possible to sue someone for abusing the system in a civil case (but just because they lost alone) and be awarded legal costs, the prevention of such abuse in the criminal system is generally provided by the early parts of the criminal process (indictment or preliminary hearing) where the the prosecution is required to demonstrate probable cause before being allowed to even proceed to trial at all.<p>I suppose you could make a case that a prosecution that fails to pass a preliminary hearing out to bear responsibility for the defendant&#x27;s reasonable legal costs incurred to that point, and that that would be parallel to the kind of protections that exist in the civil system. You might even go farther and extend this by requiring a &quot;preliminary hearing&quot; reviewing the indictment even in cases where an indictment is required (where the defense would have assistance of counsel at the preliminary hearing), since in practice indictment has generally become a weaker protection than a preliminary hearing, even though its intended as a stronger protection against abuse (hence, why it is required for federal felonies.)",1395535939

In fact, I enjoy it and have been rewarded for it well over the last 15 years. I have had the opportunity to work with and learn from some amazing developers and to build some very cool products. At the moment, I don&#x27;t have an entrepreneurial dream and I may never have one. I am content to make a living doing what I love to do - which is simply to write software.<p>I don&#x27;t think the issue is risk aversion or not following your dream. I just think that different people have different dreams and desires. At the risk of sounding like a Disney firework show - follow your dream. If you have a dream of owning your own business, you can make a plan to do that. That might involve striking out on your own early or later in life. I think you just have to ask yourself what you want.",1395533830

Calling a payment for commercial services a &quot;donation&quot; doesn&#x27;t make it a donation.  If it did, every business would ask for &quot;donations&quot; instead of payment. Indeed, as a matter of tax law, calling the Lyft fees &quot;donations&quot; actually makes it worse for the drivers--they can&#x27;t offset the &quot;donation&quot; income with their Lyft-related expenses.  (Lyft can&#x27;t recharacterize the donations it receives on behalf of the drivers as fee compensation when it remits payment to the drivers because it takes the position that they&#x27;re independent contractors and it is merely acting as a collection agent.)",1395533816

If you think about it, a child node has a fixed number of parents, but a parent can have an infinite number of children.<p>> What happens to a commit after &#x27;git reset&#x27; abandons it; can the commit be accessed ever again?<p>The commit doesn&#x27;t go anywhere (yet). What actually happens with `reset` is a touch complicated, but basically you are changing the label of the &quot;thing&quot; that you are resetting to point to a different commit . After you reset, you can still `git show <sha>`, ie. the commit is still accessible, it&#x27;s just not part of the &quot;tree&quot;.<p>> What&#x27;s the difference between reset and revert?<p>Reset will change labels (tags, branch heads), whereas revert just takes the commit you&#x27;ve given it (say `C`), inverts it (so &quot;add line X&quot; becomes &quot;delete line X&quot;), and creates a <i>new</i> commit that undoes (reverts) the changes in `C`.<p>> How can merge and rebase be trusted?<p>... to do what exactly? One thing to note is that git will bail out when a merge/rebase causes a conflict, and leaves it up to you to fix it.<p>> What are the best practices for how many branches a project should have and how & when should they be merged?<p>This is close to a &quot;Emacs vs Vim&quot;-type question (Emacs, of course ;) ). We use feature branches in our 5-developer project quite successfully, sometimes we have 10 branches in flight, and sometimes we can collapse down to `master`.<p>Branching is so cheap in Git that you can just use them as much as you want.<p>> And what are remote tracking branches?<p>A remote tracking branch (as far as I know) is just a setting for git saying local branch `A` will automatically use remote branch `B` for updates (push/pull) without having to tell git <i>every time</i> to update from `B`.",1395533082

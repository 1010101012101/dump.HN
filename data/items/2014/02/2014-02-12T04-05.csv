7222585,comment,7222299,7222489,6,0,ynniv,,,"Wow, thanks for linking a really awful rebuttal. Not only does &quot;Mark Kern, PHD, RD, CSSD, Professor of Exercise and Nutritional Sciences&quot; start off by saying that Lustig is inherently biased by selling a book &quot;Even if all proceeds are being donated to charity&quot;, he later goes on to drop such gems as:<p><i>The key for preventing obesity and metabolic syndrome is to avoid consuming excessive energy (Calories)</i><p>Maybe this is still debated in the (surely non-profit) exercise world, but I see no evidence that eating too many calories of lean meat would cause metabolic syndrome, or that limiting daily intake to 2000 calories of soda would cause one to become healthier.<p>Much of Kern&#x27;s lengthy rebuttal are technical points that are beyond me to evaluate, but I suspect that the book is intended for a non academic medical audience. In fact Kern says<p><i>It is possible that the author’s intent was to simplify these processes for the reader, but doing so inaccurately calls into question his knowledge of metabolism, upon which he bases much of his book.</i><p>Perhaps one could use other material he has authored for a technical audience. And Kern is pedantic with quotes like &quot;real food doesn’t have or need a Nutrition Facts Label&quot;. A casual reader would understand that a mango does not have a complicated ingredient list, Kern says:<p><i>While it is true that labels do not need to appear on unpackaged foods such as a produce, the Code of Federal Regulations is clear regarding nutrient labeling for these types of foods. The regulation from the Federal government is that nutrition facts must voluntarily be posted for at least 90% of fresh food items in a conspicuous place by at least 60% of companies that sell food.</i><p>Perhaps Kern doesn&#x27;t understand who the audience of a trade book is. Kern also cites many studies that I&#x27;m not going to track down and evaluate for their own biases.<p>Giving talks, writing papers and selling books is how our world works. If that&#x27;s the only thing Lustig is doing wrong, then he&#x27;s doing alright by me.<p><i>but if there&#x27;s one thing he&#x27;s proven about nutrition, it&#x27;s that he&#x27;s no one to be taken seriously when talking about it</i><p>If you&#x27;re going to grind your axe here, please make better arguments.",1392181015

This notion continues to prevail despite research from nineteen years ago that proved otherwise. In 1994, the Journal of the American Medical Association published a trial that compared older adults with high cholesterol (levels above 240 mg/dl) to those with normal levels (below 200 mg/dl).9 Over the course of four years, researchers at Yale University measured total cholesterol and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) in almost one thousand participants; they also tracked hospitalizations for heart attack and unstable angina and the rates of death from heart disease and from any other cause. No differences were found between the two groups. People with low total cholesterol had as many heart attacks and died just as frequently as those with high total cholesterol. And reviews of multiple large studies have routinely failed to find correlation between cholesterol levels and heart disease.10 Mounting research like this has prompted Dr. George Mann, a researcher with the Framingham Heart Study, to go on record stating:\nThe diet heart hypothesis that suggests that a high intake “of fat or cholesterol causes heart disease has been repeatedly shown to be wrong, and yet, for complicated reasons of pride, profit, and prejudice, the hypothesis continues to be exploited by scientists, fund-raising enterprise, food companies, and even governmental agencies.

This reminds me of Al Gore&#x27;s little movie where he talks about his old prof gathering climate data.  The temperature kept going up, and he could not figure out why.  Lots of data, no explanation.  What should have been the proper response?  Dismissal because there&#x27;s no explanation or further study?<p>I worry that there are other things where the timeline required to truly observe and understand things is not possible, and that risks are completely accepted because no current viable explanation can be made as to why the thing is actually dangerous.  The biggest one for me is wireless communications.  Can cell phones and other wireless devices cause cancer?  Generally, we say no.  But we don&#x27;t have enough data to truly say no, and we probably won&#x27;t have that data until kids born after 2000 become geriatrics, as they&#x27;ll be the first generation to truly grow up from birth in an age with ubiquitous cell phones.  And besides that, it&#x27;s not like anyone&#x27;s been able to provide any widely acceptable explanation on the matter anyway.  So we&#x27;ll just trundle along blindly because our current data says there&#x27;s no risk.  I&#x27;m mostly sad because what other choice do we really have?

I think that many of them had been taught &quot;test taking skills&quot; in high school, including a method of finding answers to math problems by guess-and-try or process of elimination. Basically, their teachers had hacked the standardized testing process. (Probably including the AP exam).<p>Honestly, college math wasn&#x27;t much better. Rather than confronting them with critical thought, we simply replaced the old hack with a new one:<p>1. Recognize the &quot;form&quot; of the problem, corresponding to a section in the textbook.<p>2. Plug the parameters of the problem into an equation solvable by the method of that section.<p>3. Apply the method and write the answer.<p>When I realized this, I told my students about it.<p>There was a chapter on maxima and minima. But the only function they had learned was the quadratic, so all optimization problems boiled down to arranging things into a quadratic. The text had them graphing each quadratic. I decided it would be more interesting for the kids to see how we make our own formulas, so we derived one for the optimum of a quadratic function, and memorized it.<p>Now is this math or not?

7222477,comment,7218913,7221060,11,0,einhverfr,,,"I actually disagree with you both with regard to the complementary nature of the sexes and the basis of feminism.  I will deal with feminism first because I think some historical background is worth looking at.<p>The typical narrative we are fed regarding women&#x27;s rights is that women decided one day they didn&#x27;t like being oppressed as they had through the ages and fought for equality which they got.  The problem is that this narrative doesn&#x27;t actually work.  It supposes a sort of oppression a few centuries ago that is really hard to support on the evidence, and it supposes an equality today which is just as far off.  Also not all feminists have adopted this narrative.  Many post-modernist feminists (for example Robbie Davis-Floyd) have not.<p>It is worth remembering that Jefferson&#x27;s campaign called Adams (in 1800, <i>LONG</i> before the 19th Amendment) &quot;a hideous hermaphroditical figure, lacking the force and firmness of a man, and the gentleness and sensibility of a woman.&quot;  Far from the oppressed narrative here, this quote strongly suggests women having important roles in the political discourse.  We see this also from letters in the day.  Similarly there were whole industries dominated by women before they were industrialized (interestingly depending on time and place this included not only textile manufacture but also brewing, midwifery, and more).  So before industrialization, women had businesses.  They were entrepreneurs, and strong active players in both politics and the economy.<p>What happened though is that the women&#x27;s industries were the ones which were industrialized most heavily and consequently between this and urbanization women were kicked out of the economy.  I strongly suspect <i>also</i> that women&#x27;s political institutions (which were relatively informal but no less effective) were also destroyed.  Feminism, women&#x27;s suffrage, etc. to my mind is a reaction to <i>that</i> sort of inequality that industrialization brought.<p>On to the issue of complementary natures.  The question I think is the question of an aversion to essentialism which is generally seen as constraining.  This is, I think, a relatively recent phenomenon.  Essentialism which presupposes that women are by nature both more gentle and <i>sensible</i> than men, but that men are more <i>predictable</i> is not so oppressive and that&#x27;s the sort of essentialism one sees in pre-industrial America.  This was not new.  Chris Faraone in his excellent study &quot;Ancient Greek Love Magic&quot; talks a lot about drama and love spell formulas in ancient Greece in terms of complementary forms of misogyny and misandry (and contrary to what the male Greek writers thought, women had a <i>lot</i> of power in ancient Greece).<p>Of course the truth is probably more abstract than was seen by any time and place, but some patterns are unavoidable.  If women&#x27;s political work is behind the scenes, then reliability and keeping one&#x27;s word becomes very specifically an important male trait (because it is what assures a woman that her interests will be protected), and it means that men largely navigate a social world created by the social entanglements of women.<p>The complementary natures are not &quot;stay at home and raise kids&quot; vs &quot;go accomplish stuff&quot; but rather &quot;working together and socially&quot; vs &quot;going off by oneself to work alone.&quot;  This one pattern is extremely common.",1392179088

The two major exceptions to this are<p>1. Things which aren&#x27;t essential to your business. (e.g.: things that could be replaced by nothing (even if just temporarily))<p>2. Things which meet the definition of a commodity, in the formal &#x27;fungible goods&#x27; sense of the word.<p>Many .?aaS offerings fail both of these tests in that they&#x27;re an essential component of a service, and also fail the commodity test in that there is qualitative differentiation between offerings.  The features of EC2 (used to their fullest) are wildly different than those of Rackspace, and the two are only really fungible with one another across a small subset of their feature sets.<p>Examples of offerings that pass this commodity test include:<p>- Most mailers (sendgrid, mailgun, postmark, &c) <i>when used simply</i>. Switching from one backend to another isn&#x27;t a huge endeavour, as they are all cut from conceptually similar cloth.<p>- VPS offerings <i>when used simply</i> (notice a pattern here?). A basic Ubuntu box in the cloud is a basic Ubuntu box in the cloud.<p>In contrast, Stackmob, Parse, et al. all fail this commodity test <i>hard</i>.

I agree completely that the point is moot unless you ship; the GP wasn&#x27;t really intended to be imperative; it was meant (or at least it was always how I understood it) as more as a heuristic to assess the risk associated with outsourcing a core dependency that can&#x27;t be easily hedged.",1392179013

Once any organization gets to a certain size, getting change to happen is more &quot;social problem&quot; and less &quot;technical problem.&quot; When you don&#x27;t select for people at that stage who can move an entire organization over to a new way of doing things, your organization will stagnate and die. It used to really annoy me at Google when technical evaluators who dismiss those &quot;soft qualities&quot; in candidates. I had a fairly famous Googler tell me point blank that anyone could change the organization by shouting loudly enough. Which I tried to explain was just as false as saying anyone can solve a problem if they write enough code.

Peter Todd (well-known Bitcoin developer), said[1]:<p>> [...]I&#x27;m a bit hesitant to bake in assumptions about malleability when we have no solid idea if ECC signatures are or are not malleable on a fundemental level; if &quot;whack-a-mole&quot; anti-malleability is all we&#x27;ve got it could be ugly if a break is found.<p>I understand this to mean, there may be unknown ways to transform signatures, like the s sign flip you quoted.  In that case there would be no way to know which representation is &quot;canonical.&quot;  Thus, malleability is either a fundamental, fatal flaw in Bitcoin, or just something Bitcoin developers need to work around.<p>Now, it seems even the reference implementation isn&#x27;t perfect about malleability, and perhaps people could have been better about making the issue known.  So there is work to be done, but it is not a &quot;bug&quot; that can be &quot;fixed&quot;, at least not without upgrading the entire network, and/or risking it popping up in the future when someone applies more ECDSA signature mutation tricks.  The real solution, if you want to safely fingerprint transactions, is to make your own transaction hash that is immune to malleability, like [2].<p>[1] <a href=""http://sourceforge.net/mailarchive/message.php?msg_id=31954652"" rel=""nofollow"">http://sourceforge.net/mailarchive/message.php?msg_id=319546...</a><p>[2] <a href=""https://github.com/sipa/bitcoin/commit/e7853a91cf646a6a4701158d148f036924575a97"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/sipa/bitcoin/commit/e7853a91cf646a6a47011...</a>",1392178370

Whereas with utf16 there&#x27;s a bunch of people who are either new or should never have been programmers to begin with that are clueless about it. Sadly this number is so large that just about any program that uses utf-16 strings is broken for inputs where code points != characters.

Dollars are already backed up by guns, so the notion of &#x27;price controlling&#x27; dollars makes no sense.<p>On the contrary, with a fixed-ratio gold standard currency it is still the state who said that a dollar was by definition equivalent with, say, 1/35th of an ounce of gold (as it was just before the U.S. finally abandoned the standard for good). But the only reason the government would give you $35/troy ounce was because of the men with the guns, and the government could change their minds.<p>In fact, the U.S. <i>did</i> arbitrarily change their mind several times throughout their history about &quot;what gold was worth&quot;. This didn&#x27;t change the market value of gold of course, but this didn&#x27;t stop the politicians from abusing fiscal policy for their own interests.<p>The interesting thing is more that there was a market value of gold which was <i>different</i> from the &quot;official&quot; government price of gold, which should illustrate by itself the issue.<p>Rather there was never anything special about gold except that people thought it was special. The U.S. started off on a gold <i>and silver</i> standard after all, which led to problems fairly soon after since the difference between gold and silver value that Congress decreed was not always the difference the markets created.<p>While I&#x27;ll agree it&#x27;s possible to have gold-backed fiat currency (like the Civil War-era greenbacks), there&#x27;s no reason why it&#x27;s &quot;more responsible&quot;. It&#x27;s still just as susceptible to government intervention and it unnecessarily conflates non-orthogonal concepts for the sake of... what?<p>Gold was only valuable because people thought it was valuable. If you went to a desert island you could form an economy on water bottles. Prisoners actually <i>did</i> form economies on cigarettes, and when cigarettes were banned the currency shifted to cans of mackerel.<p>As far as I&#x27;m concerned gold-backed dollars make as much sense as dollars backed by sardine cans. At least true fiat currencies (and Bitcoin) finally gave up the middle-man and acknowledge that their currencies are worth what people think they&#x27;re worth.

Just that, with many people, if I spend enough time observing them, I can start to predict what they&#x27;ll do or say with better than chance accuracy. The best analogy I can give is not Sherlock Holmes, but Groundhog day. What people miss in that movie is that the main character (Phil Connors played by Bill Murray) is spending his time mapping out the behavior patterns of the girl of his dreams (Rita by Andie MacDowell) to see if he can find the behavior pathways that will lead to her falling in love with him (or sleeping with him depending on your take on the story). Many people follow routines and habits, and if you observe them long enough it&#x27;s like spending the same &quot;day&quot; over and over with them. You can start to mentally note and map out their behavior and then start making predictions about that behavior.<p>Most people do it all the time, we track what foods or films or whatever our friends like and dislike, and then make recommendations to them, or buy them presents based on that. We <i>know</i> them, so we think we can predict their behavior on a like/dislike vector. But what if you observed other things? Say you find a friend has an extreme allergy to milk and milk products. You can guess then that, if they drink coffee, they&#x27;ll use a milk substitute, maybe soy. If they use soy, and you know what stores in their area carry soy milk and which don&#x27;t and the ones that do are only the vegetarian stores, then you might be able to make a probabilistic guess that they&#x27;re vegetarian. If they&#x27;re vegetarian, you know there aren&#x27;t many restaurants that are vegetarian in their area, so they probably cook at home, meaning they have a decent kitchen. So you can guess they have decent cookware, guessing at their income level you can guess if it&#x27;s $100 an item cookware of $1000 an item cookware. There&#x27;s only so many vendors at each price point for that, and only so many sell in my area etc., and on and on to yoga studio and car choice and neighborhood.<p>You can probabilistically guess all kinds of things from a cup of coffee. A little more observation, a comment here and there, a couple questions from you to direct your guesses and you can improve your chances and before you know it you can run down the list of consumer choices many individuals make which defines their space.<p>Even singular biases or opinions can tell you worlds about a person. It&#x27;s kind of like stereotyping, but it&#x27;s a little more informed than that. You can guess, for example, a person with strong opinions on say gun rights is likely aligned with several other related categories. Differences in those aligned categories might tell you other things, and let you know if they&#x27;re conservative, liberal, anarchist or something else. Even a <i>single</i> comment can inform your predictive model about a person and set boundaries on what they would or wouldn&#x27;t do.<p>You also have to <i>know</i> things. I couldn&#x27;t do this with somebody from a country or area I don&#x27;t know anything about. I don&#x27;t know the politics, neighborhoods, social signals, in and out group dynamics and on and on.<p>Another example, there&#x27;s an old phrase, &quot;everybody skis in Aspen&quot;, meaning that knowing a person is from Aspen implies they do snow sports, but knowing that doesn&#x27;t inform you of much other than they probably own a pair of skis or a snowboard and there&#x27;s a fair chance they come from money.<p>But knowing a person you meet in someplace like Tampa, is an avid skier (an outlier) tells you all kinds of things about them. That they travel, that they probably don&#x27;t go to anywhere on the East Coast (the snow sucks), that they probably have a passport (to go to the Canadian Rockies or the Alps), and gives you an idea of their disposable income they set aside for trips and skiing, which then can inform you of their total income and on and on and on.<p>People are like chaotic systems, and every piece of information you know restricts the space they can operate in. Within limits you can infer many many things. And it&#x27;s not superhuman.",1392177738

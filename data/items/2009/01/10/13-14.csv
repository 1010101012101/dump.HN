427922,comment,427112,427586,0,0,ggruschow,,,"Now that I came back to HN for my morning fix and made it through the form:<p>1. Seems to only have trance-y stuff, not the general electronic dance music (e.g. search for popular non-trance artists: Pendulum, Prodigy, or Aphex Twin). The only problem with that is the expectation from the description.<p>2. On my browsers (Safari, FF3), the sets search edit box isn't clickable / won't take focus. I can only search tracks and artists.<p>3. How does this help me? Is it just a nicer interface than Amazon's? I frequent sites like <a href=""http://dnb-sets.de"" rel=""nofollow"">http://dnb-sets.de</a> to listen to music. I suppose this is a compelling argument for pandora to take mixed sets into their playlist?<p>Now, I've closed it because I don't see a reason to use it. This is a major problem because I figure I'm probably the best consumer you can imagine for this. I love this music. I listen to it online for literally hours nearly every day. I'm very hungry to find new stuff to listen to, have it available to listen to again (I had physical media storage problems back when raves were big), and I'm happy to pay ridiculous sums for the service (e.g. i'd pay $10 just to know the name of the D&B song from 1-2 years ago with certain fight club samples#, and if I couldn't quickly find a mix with it online, maybe $25 for an mp3 of it).<p>If the site had a much broader range of music, and at least 100x more of it, I might use it. Even then, you'd need a compelling reason for me to stick around on your site (e.g. making it easy for me to find tracks I don't know what they are and buy them... or sucking in zillions of mixes and indexing them continuously in a way more convenient than others do).<p>___<p># example sample, Tyler Durden: ""You have to consider the possibility that God does not like you. He never wanted you. In all probability, he hates you."" This isn't the more common tune you'll find in your quick search. Like I said, I'm serious, I want this tune.",1231594332

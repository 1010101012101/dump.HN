Growing up geeky in India didn't have any such downsides, but that might have been peculiar to the small school  went to,but I don't think it fully explains it.

Potentially it was the emotional reaction I had on his behalf, but I like to think that it was the realism of his scenario: ""I don't think I had it particularly worse than a lot of others"" and ""here are the things that are entirely my problem that accelerated this treatment"". While 'the system' is sometimes to blame, it's also the person. And he understands that. But since he works for Google, it's clear that he got it together in later life, and distancing himself from those who used to drag him down is probably a good choice. School reunions are often just people gloating about how awesome they think they are at life anyways, so why should he put himself in a position to potentially arouse jealousy?",1247837070

709784,comment,709685,709685,0,0,skolor,,,"I'm a little suspicious of the collection method for the data. While you got 6500 results, when I register for most sites I have a couple of ""low security"" passwords I use (which I rotate ever 6 months or so), so that whenever I come across a site that says my usually username is taken, I've got a good guess that I registered at some point and forgot about it (this has happens about 4-5 times a year).<p>So, what I would be wondering is if many of the results are the same thing. I certainly wouldn't register for a survey with on of my more secure passwords (or generate a new one for it). I would also be more likely to put in a nonsense password that I won't need to remember, and will immediately forget. One thing that should probably be checked, at least before you can draw any real conclusions, is how well the user can log in.<p>While it is true that the claim was that unobscured password\nfields would make for more secure passwords to be used, the reason was that an unobscured password would be easier to type and remember when logging in. If you remove that logging in feature, its hard to have any real conclusions.",1247836763

Well... I just changed ""mysql"" to ""sqlite"" in my DB config, fixed a few problems with SQL CREATE statements and it worked.<p>On a side note I also agree with the ""PHP is the best templating languge"" idea. I just use a template class for it that has a similar API to Smarty.<p>So yes, I use abstraction layers in both cases. I guess that is more convenient because I do not work on any one web application for too long and I need to carry my libraries and knowledge painlessly from place to place.

Even if the hashing algorithm is the same everywhere, two different urls can yield the very same hash, and the birthday effect (that is, there's a very large chance that two students share the same birthday in a class of 30) makes that an important problem. URL shorteners need to have some sort of mechanism to deal with hash collisions, but this means that it can only be assumed that two identical hashes point to the same url if we know that the very same database is backing both.<p>Sure, you can increase the length of the hash to a level where the birthday effect isn't very significant but that would mean longer hashes.

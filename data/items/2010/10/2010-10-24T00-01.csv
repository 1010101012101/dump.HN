I'll debug this one with you, sorry for the inconvenience.<p>As for random times, it actually does that a little bit. I pushed most of the timezone code to behind the scenes so that it will automatically figure out your timezone through javascript and then push it server side via ajax. I also put in a random checker in the views that will decide if the user should have their timezone checked.<p>Given the timezone, it tries to guess your ""working hours"", i.e. 8am to 6pm your time. It'll send you a set number of random texts throughout each day, that number is set by the message frequency in your profile.<p>That was one of my biggest concerns. Google calendar sends me a daily email at 5:15am with my calendar in it. That's nice, but I have a hunch that the texts will be less effective if people know that they will come at a set point throughout the day. So that's my rationale for randomizing the delivery time throughout the day.<p>I have been thinking about dropping in a slider bar to set both the text message frequency, as well as the texting window throughout the day, so I'll definitely be implementing your feature in the near future.",1287881637

It's the best mac I've ever had (and my 10th since 1992). I do a fair amount of graphics work as well as code, and it's suitable for that - don't let anyone tell you otherwise. You can't walk into a Costco or Sam's Club without seeing labels I designed on my Air. And for coding, it's a dream. The ONLY reason I'd be a bit averse to getting the new one is it's no faster than mine; with the SSD, ""2Gb"" of RAM is really never a limit since the drive is basically lightning fast anyway; and the new one doesn't have a backlit keyboard, which is bad because I don't stop coding when it gets dark.<p>I'm an expatriate and live on the road; I'm literally never anywhere without my laptop, not even for five minutes, so the weight and form factors are critical. And I don't use my computer for entertainment, and don't care about having a DVD drive, etc. I do all my development with Flex, Dreamweaver, Dashcode and a LAMP stack, so my needs may not match those of desktop app devs. But for me it's really been ideal.",1287881509

Rent in Emeryville/South Berkeley/North Oakland is cheaper than SF, but it's still easy to get to SF/Peninsula by BART.<p>We were renting a 1400sq ft 3 bedroom house in Emeryville for $1750/mo a couple years back, and a 700sq ft 1 bedroom apartment in South Berkeley for $750/mo before that.

As far as public transit goes, it's a bit more painful than SF, but not too bad. My morning commute from Oakland to work in SOMA takes about 30 minutes - 10 minute walk, 15 minutes (2 stops) on BART, another 5 minute walk.

There there was this brokerage company (""Wit Capital"") which would give out IPOs to us serfs on a first-come, first-served basis. They usually got very few shares (maybe a couple of 1000 at most), and gave out only 100 to each applicant; and the competition was fierce. I wrote a Perl script which would poll their site (usually they announced an IPO in the evening), and if there was an IPO, it would fill out the web forms and submit it immediately. (This was before WWW:Mechanize and all those modules). I got in on quite a few of those, flipped them, and made a nice sum.<p>Later, ETrade got in the game. They would give you at most 100 shares. But I realized that you could open multiple accounts in ETrade and increase your chances of getting the IPOs. So I opened 35 accounts in all. Once again I wrote Perl scripts to fill in the multi-step forms and submit them. This was pure screen scraping and LWP. Once again I got into a lot of IPOs. (Side note: but this time I decided to hang on to many of them, instead of flipping them immediately. Sadly, I ended up losing a good chunk of money too; but overall still came out quite ahead :) ).<p>-----<p>When I was in the univ lab, the dorms got ethernet. Lots of students started sharing their disks via Windows. I hacked together a ""search engine"" with smbclient and Perl which would crawl their shares and index their contents; and with a simple Perl+curses app, I could pick stuff and download it.

I've been working on a website that will be able to replace Skype for a few features, such as video calling, calling, chatting etc. 
I also have a feature where you can meet new people, the omegle/chat roulette way, but the ability to invite someone you know into the conversation makes it better, and the fact of having a contact list makes it better, because you can stay in touch with people you meet, instead of having to ask if they have a desktop program to stay in touch, but what happens is often this:
""Do you have Skype?"" No.
""MSN?"" No...
Alright then bye...<p>We are using the newest Adobe's technologies that allow for p2p directly on the web, and this is what provides the best user experience for video chat, and we want to be the best with it.<p>If you're interested on this project, and hearing about future ideas I'll put on the website, and discussing about new ideas, please tell me.<p>I have a few employees to which I outsource some work, but I am the only founder, therefore the only one who is higly motivated, so having highly motivated people on my side would be huge for me.<p>Thank you!",1287880354

You could turn this into a not-at-all-random algorithm that performs even better, given sufficient (vast) computing power: enumerate, and execute, all ""cheap enough"" computations that produce sets of answers; use this to put some suitable probability distribution on answer-sets (so that answers generated by cheaper computations are more probable, and then (deterministically) choose your answers to minimize the probability of failure.

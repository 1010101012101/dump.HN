3687287,comment,3686950,3687227,3,0,Groxx,,,"While I agree, and I fully expected it to go to March 1st instead, the core of the problem is that dates <i>don't</i> obey basic arithmetic identities.  Treating Feb 29 as a zero value is an elegant solution in some ways.<p>But say 2012-02-29 + 1 year went to 2013-03-01.  Then what's 2012-03-01 - 1 year?  Does it go to March 1st every time, sometimes ignoring that there's an extra day in between, or does it go back 365 days (March 2nd)?<p>I suspect the only ""solution"" is to decide that calendar dates are for human consumption <i>only</i>.  If you're doing any calculations, you do them on timestamps, where you can declare a 'year' to be one of 365.256363004, 365.24219, or 365.259636 days (sidereal, tropical, and anomalistic years)[1].  Given the importance of calendars and seasons, you'd probably want to use the middle one, as they all essentially share that length of time as a definition of a year.  That way you can just screw the whole leap-year concept entirely.<p>Of course, then you're left with year-long agreements that expire at odd hours of the night.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Year#Sidereal.2C_tropical.2C_and_anomalistic_years"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Year#Sidereal.2C_tropical.2C_an...</a>",1331362612

You'd be well advised to be aware of this, because you're being manipulated.<p>And the fact that someone else is paying for the system doesn't make it right.  Just because I'm not paying for a DRM'd product (and very often you <i>do</i> pay) doesn't make it ""right"".

Almost all of the wars and trouble in the region are a result of the current national borders having been imposed on the continent by colonialists who divided up the spoils, rather than being based on local tribal affiliations.<p>Uganda does not have a single ethnic group that comprises more than 10% of the overall population. This leads to instability, turmoil and multiple coupe's (Kony belongs to a tribal group that a former president belonged to. His army was founded initially in reaction to persecution following the coupe). During the 90s there were over 40 conflicts at any one time in Africa - some of them the deadliest seen since WW2 (5.4M in Congo 2 - which the Ugandan military started with its invasion).<p>Most governments resort to corruption and violence to retain positions of power. That includes exploiting minerals and mining on the black market, nationalizing assets, etc. All to get and retain power. There are very few functioning peaceful free market democracies.<p>There is also a lot to be said about western aid methods (see Dead Aid[1]). Our food programs have been known to destroy local economies. What the WTO would consider dumping (and a trade violation) in the west we call 'aid' in Africa.<p>Before having an opinion on the Kony campaign, you should know these things:<p>1. Kony was indicted by the International Criminal Court 7 years ago.<p>2. He left Uganda around that time. Most of the internal refugees in Uganda have settled back home. Uganda has been relatively peaceful since.<p>3. The images of children hiding from militias in camps <i>was</i> big news in the west when it happen - back in 2003. There was even a celebrity campaign and congressional lobbying at the time to do something about it. This isn't a 2012 issue.<p>4. The last US trained mission in 2006 to capture Kony resulted in a months long terror campaign by the LRA that killed hundreds[2]<p>5. Most local groups, including clergy, oppose a military solution since the remote villages in the region are not adequately protected from retribution [3]<p>6. the LRA has largely been an ineffective fighting force in the past 7 years, and have only attacked villages while retreating from military campaigns<p>7. Almost all the local aid groups including doctors without borders oppose a military solution<p>Knowing this and then watching the Kony campaign video you find that there is a lot that isn't being mentioned, some if it misleading. It has intentionally simplified the situation and problem down to a good guys vs bad guys paradigm - where there is only a single bad guy responsible for all ills (even his soldiers have been kidnapped, it is Kony alone who is evil). Kony is a symptom of a deeper seeded problem and not the solution. This campaign video spends a lot more time talking about Facebook and social media and showing people in the west a lot more than it talks and discusses the problems in the region. Not a single mention of the Congo war (worst in death toll since WW2), nor of the situation in Uganda, and with facts that were true 8 years ago but not today.<p>The danger here is misleading people into believing that the problems of the region are the responsibility of a single person, and the solution is to capture that one person. The proposed solution is perhaps the worst part - to re-arm and train a military that was partly responsible for the worst war since WW2 and to send more troops into Congo and other nations.<p>I think the desired solution is the exact opposite - don't make Kony famous, don't give him a means to arm more followers, keep him in the middle of the jungle where he isn't a threat to anybody and ignore him to the point where his message and means are completely ineffective. This is what has been happening since the last US raid and today.<p>I think this is a good opportunity to get a real message out about Africa. Be it through a film that covers the modern history of the region or a social campaign to back more pragmatic NGO's that don't take sides in conflicts.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Dead-Aid-Working-Better-Africa/dp/1553655427/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1331359746&sr=8-1"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Dead-Aid-Working-Better-Africa/dp/1553...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.nytimes.com/2009/02/07/world/africa/07congo.html?_r=1"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nytimes.com/2009/02/07/world/africa/07congo.html?...</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://allafrica.com/stories/201111130058.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://allafrica.com/stories/201111130058.html</a>",1331361158

The next Steve Jobs\nWhy does PG seem to think that there has to be the ""next"" Steve Jobs?   Is there some sort of pattern to be recognized from the Apple story, that a startup can emulate and be successful.<p>Wasn't Apple a large company already, even before Steve Jobs came back to it.   Though Apple at that time was in a dire conditions, it wasn't exactly a start up.  How come some hardware startup during the 90's, 00's, and this decade, do what Apple has done.<p>I know people think Apple is constantly inventing something ""new"" and always needs something ""new"" for it to survive, but I don't think that is the case.   I bet the iPhone wasn't really created in just 2 years, I am sure Apple had been working on it for a long time.   A feet that is much more difficult for a start up, to do R&D for a long sustained period and pay the bills with some other product.  PG had the following quote.<p>PG:\n""well, and I asked him if the people now running the company would be able to keep creating new things the way Apple had under Steve Jobs.""<p>I think Steve Jobs had a particular vision for his products for a long long time.  He might have thought about functions of the current iPhone and iPad during the Newton days.  Steve might have had 3-4 products that he wanted to create, and thats it.  We don't have enough data to interpret, that Steve would of kept pumping out ""new"" products if he was alive, like the iCar.<p>Allot of Apples success have been through luck and timing and making the right gamble.  Jobs couldn't have put Apple back, without the help of numerous people, and the above mentioned.<p>I think if PG seriously wants to find the Apple formula in a start up; he may as well start playing the lottery.  Eventually with enough time he will find one.   But the odds don't look so good.<p>I am a fan of his writing, but I found this article to be disingenuous at best.

Bring Back Moore's Law\n</code></pre>\nhmmm, maybe <i>developer cycles are more valuable than machine cycles</i> really is getting out of sync with current conditions?<p>I didn't connect stalled clock-speeds to the web being slow til reading this.  One reason is that web-serving is usually embarrassingly parallel, as each client is independent. Some other causes are increased client-side JS; assembling many services (eg. amazon); increased usage with resources not keeping pace. But pg's point is surely a factor too.<p>Bloated frameworks, and software with many layers (some quite unnecessary) were facilitated by increasing clock-speeds - but at least it's possible to get rid of them.  Also, work has been done on JS JIT compilation. Server languages are getting faster too.<p>This may seem like a tangent, but bear with me: Clayton Christensen (who coined <i>disruption</i>) makes an interesting point about ""integrated""  (closely-coupled, interdependent)  vs. ""modular"" (clean interfaces enabling mix-and-match) architecture.<p>The advantage of integration is you can make it perform <i>fast</i> - you can optimize ""performance"" according to a variety of definitions (e.g. smaller, lighter, more memory, less battery power etc). This wins when customers value increased performance - Christensen describes this willing to pay more for performance as it ""not being good enough"" because once it's good enough, they won't pay for more of it.<p>The economic advantage of <i>modularity</i> is you can develop <i>fast</i>, you can create and customize more quickly.  Part of this is reusing components (e.g. buy off-the-shelf or open source, or reuse internally) - this wins when customers value that over performance.  This usually doesn't happen until performance is ""good enough"": if it's too slow to use, who cares how configurable it is?<p>An example is iPhone/iPad (integrated) vs. Android (modular). The iPhone/iPad is fast, light, slim, long battery-life, better resolution, smoother animation etc.  In contrast, there are many different Android devices, with different prices, displays, shapes etc, and many have customized UIs.<p>Christensen's fascinating point is not that one approach is better than the other, but that they change over time, cycling back and forth. It depends on what the market wants at the moment: what will customers pay for more of?<p>Following the example, once smart-phones become ""good enough"" in performance, customers will start to buy on other factors, such as price. This seems to be starting to happen for smart-phones; but not yet for tablets.<p>In relation to pg's observation of server slowness, it seems that formerly, performance was good enough, and so the developers that were most successful favoured mix-and-match layers, because they were faster to develop and easier to customize.  But now, performance is a problem... which may mean that developers who favour integration will be most successful.  It's not black and white, but an interesting perspective.",1331360754

Even then, nobody is sure if it is even a cost effective measure.<p>It is difficult and costly to produce a screening test. It also takes many years to validate. Then there is the problem of what to do with the results - for example, if you are diagnosed with possible pancreatic cancer, the treatment is a massive operation to replumb your upper abdomen. 5% of people die because of the surgery alone, and the surgery costs a fortune.<p>Unfortunately a simple relationship like ""find cancer early = good outcome"" does not exist. There are incredibly high barriers for a startup developing diagnostic tests for screening. There is a good reason why the only people doing cancer screening studies are large government funded research consortia that can afford to wait 10 years or more to prove a result.<p>The example of Bill Clinton is misapplied - cardiovascular disease is really common, maybe 30% or more of people will get heart disease in western countries. We don't need to have a cool machine to screen for it, we need to risk stratify people with a few simple tests (ie ask them if they have a family history, check their cholesterol and blood pressure) and improve their risk factors (eat better, quite smoking, exercise, lower cholesterol etc).

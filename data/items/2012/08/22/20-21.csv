They could shutter their blog and stop all interviews and continue on as a successful business indefinitely.<p>However if you're a young company learning the ropes and looking to emulate 37s' success, you have to first understand that 37s is a company that is built on PR.  They were around for years doing consulting work before they ever built a single product.  They were one of the early noteworthy web design blogs, and they built a significant audience right around the time people were figuring out how to go beyond brochure websites.  So when Basecamp launched in 2004 they had the most valuable possible audience in the palm of their hands.  It didn't hurt that true web applications were in their infancy, and they were essentially competing with bloated desktop software like MS Project, but it's important not dismiss their reach in the web design blogosphere.  Without that, there's no telling if the product would have had the uptake to become their sole focus or whether they would have gone back to more consulting work.",1345669186

Less waste would mean less food production and less environmental impact.<p>Perhaps it's just me, but I've always felt like wasting anything that has scarcity-- food, water, etc-- is just a morally bad thing to do.",1345669152

4419533,comment,4418904,4419446,2,0,cyarvin,,,"A couple of things I don't see on a quick scan of the docs:<p>(1) I don't see how one Tent entity contacts another proactively - it looks like A can't message B unless B has already chosen to follow A.  If this is so, is it an anti-spam measure?  Given that StatusNet etc. are infested with spam, it seems like a very wise one :-)  On the other hand, it is rather limiting as compared to centralized platforms, don't you think?<p>(2) I don't see how you maintain the promise of a portable identity when your identities are hosted URIs.  Eg, if my identity is tent.is/foobar, and I want to move to a different host, how do I do that?  I can download my data, sure.  It looks like I can even bounce from tent.is to another data server.  But unless I want to break all my social connections, don't I remain at the mercy of tent.is?  This strikes me as a rather unsolvable problem, but it would be reassuring to clarify that you're not solving it :-)",1345669096

4419444,comment,4418515,4418967,13,0,ars,,,"> but on a rough-order-of-magnitude basis, is that a reasonable conclusion?<p>No. Uranium is barely radioactive. In contrast the waste from a power plant is very radioactive.<p>Radioactivity is directly related to half life: The longer the half life, the less radioactive, and the reverse as well.<p>Uranium 235 has a half life of close to a billion years, and 238 (the much more common kind) of nearly 5 billion years. So it's barely radioactive.<p>Once you ""cook"" it in a reactor you generate all sorts of isotopes with much shorter half lives (so none exist naturally in any quantity). Those isotopes are also much more radioactive. The good thing is that the very powerful ones don't last long.<p>The ""worst"" isotopes are the medium lived ones. Short enough to be radioactive, long enough to last for centuries. Of those Strontium-90 and Caesium-137 are the main ones.<p>Now you also know why nuclear fuel reprocessing is a great idea. The uranium left behind after a pass through a reactor has not been changed (it's not any more radioactive than it was before it started) - you can isolate it chemically and use it again (only a small amount actually burns each time). You still need to deal with the dangerous stuff, but the quantity is massively reduced. (Technically you can burn that as well in a reactor to other shorter lived isotopes, and essentially destroy any hazard, but I don't believe anyone does that.)<p>Just to respond to your actual idea, there are proposals to bury waste in subduction zones. You can find more about it via google <a href=""https://www.google.com/search?q=nuclear+subduction+zone"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.google.com/search?q=nuclear+subduction+zone</a>",1345667739

Humbly quoting the motivation:<p>> What is wrong with other social services?\nCentralized Social Service Providers limit what you can share and who you can share with. They only allow users to interact with other users on the same network. Because their products are centralized and maintained by a company, users are left in the cold when the company changes its products or shuts down. There's nothing wrong with a company offering users social services. But users shouldn't be limited by those companies. Imagine if you could only email other customers of your Internet Service Provider. Unfortunately Centralized Social Service Providers have done just that. You can only communicate directly with other users of their closed network.<p>> If you don't like a bank you can withdraw your money and deposit it somewhere else, including your own home. You could even start a new bank where you and your friends felt safe. You can still pay your bills and maintain your financial relationships, just tell them about your new account. We aren't talking about money. Your data is far more valuable your family and friends' photos, locations, and private communications. You should be able to store them somewhere you trust, move them when you want, control who can and can't see them.",1345666549

So, the valuation doesn't look too arbitrary.<p>The good thing is that the CEO has been the CEO of another big company for >10 years. So he is capable of making this company a success. This company has been around for 5 years and has some physical products out there, so the chance of it going belly up over a short period is relatively low.<p>They are offering a salary that slightly exceeds that job current job including bonus/401K etc. and the vesting period for the options is 3 years with 1/3rd of the options vesting each year.<p>The CEO wants to make the company profitable and keep it private if possible. He said I could sell the options back to the company once they vest. He said he just converted somebody's options to company's stock once they vested. I am not sure if I can get real cash for the options though, if the company is still private and not seeking funding.<p>The offer letter says vesting period, but it doesn't give details regarding what happens if the company gets acquired before my options vest.<p>Is it okay to ask for the options agreement, before joining the company ?",1345666533

It's possible (though unlikely, from what I've seen here) that they have some deep new insight into the nature of time, sure. But <i>any</i> successful theory of time will have to be almost indistinguishable from standard 3+1 dimensional spacetime under ""ordinary"" conditions, or else it will contradict a huge body of experimental evidence.

Downs can be detected in time for an abortion, but it means that you have to get pregnant all over again, and risk Downs and the various other bad mutations again, and risk miscarriage for whatever reasons all over again, etc.<p>So for non-fundamentalist women, there is fear of having a Downs child, but it gets rolled into the package of ""worried about getting to have a successful pregnancy at all"".",1345665849

4419266,comment,4416864,4416864,4,0,voyou,,,"I used Goodfilms briefly, but the rating system is so bad I stopped. The odd thing is that, as this blog post demonstrates, they recognize the problem and then totally fail to solve it. Ratings tend to be fairly bimodal, with people either liking or disliking stuff and not making fine-grained choices. In response to this, the Goodfilms system  makes ratings continuous, so that rather than trying to figure out whether a film is 4 or 5 stars, the user now has to figure out whether it's 3.8 stars or 4.6, then compounds the problem by making the user rate on two separate scales with a pretty opaque distinction. So the response to the observation that people's ratings tend to be simplistic is to make the rating system much more complicated; it's pretty much the exact opposite of a solution (I quite like letterboxd's system, which has five-star ratings and also a ""like"" button, which gives you some level of choice over how fine-grained you want to make your ratings).",1345665743

Also, it only takes 10 ft of water to block all radiation, alpha, beta and gamma.<p>However.  Radioactive 'waste' is actually really useful.  We can recycle it and use it.  It's just a matter of regulations and cost.  I'd much rather make our radioactive by products readily accessible for when we can use it as either fuel (only need a higher neutron flux) or extract elements for various uses.",1345665732

You can&#x27;t <i>implement</i> anything in GraphQL: absolutely all of its expressions are implementation-provided — contrast with, say, SQL, which, being an actual query language, defines operators, arithmetic expressions, mutations, etc. A defining quality of a protocol is that it&#x27;s a medium through which clients can talk to multiple black-box implementations, which is exactly what GraphQL is.<p>I like GraphQL, but I wish you&#x27;d thought through the name before you started to publish about it. If you&#x27;d called it something like Extensible API Protocol, nobody would have batted an eyelid.",1443581962

But if the application owns your data—if it stores it behind the scenes and never exposes it to you directly—then your data is exactly as fragile as that application. If there’s a bug, your data can disappear. If the company goes under, your application can rot to unusability. If the product is discontinued, the same. If the company kills a feature, you have to do without it. Or, most likely of all, the company could start publishing buggier and buggier updates, and you’ll have no choice but to use buggier and buggier software.<p>It seems like a clear choice to me: if the data is anything I value, I must have direct access to it, regardless of what tools I use to manipulate it.

This means just assuming that I didn&#x27;t make my point clearly or that I was mistaken or didn&#x27;t use the right approach to the reader. When I am downvoted, I tend to edit my comments. Sometimes this means changing the words around.<p>And sometimes it means deleting the comment. Not because I&#x27;m afraid of being banned, but because it&#x27;s not very good.  I&#x27;ve found that deleting not very good comments is good practice. That just saying the stupid thing that I feel compelled to say is enough. I don&#x27;t need someone to actually read it. I&#x27;d rather have people read my occasional good comment.<p>On the flip side. Sometimes I downvote a comment in lieu of arguing. Actually, it&#x27;s probably a lot more often than sometimes. Those downvotes are in lieu of mostly unproductive xkcd386 &quot;someone is wrong on the internet&quot; comments I might write if downvoting and moving on wasn&#x27;t an option.<p>There are things about which it is reasonable to disagree. For example I believe that discussion is more productive than debate and that conversation is far more productive than either because it doesn&#x27;t require opposing viewpoints as a starting point and doesn&#x27;t entail the idea of winning or scoring points.<p>There are plenty of other places I could do that.",1443581692

I believe that Mesos&#x27; work on oversubscription took concerns around this issue into consideration.<p>It&#x27;s really fascinating to compare the architecture of Nomad vs K8s, because both claim heavy descendence from Omega + Borg.

With a model like IMSA&#x27;s there tends to be an ever increasing amount of bureaucracy. I have heard teachers mention grade quota’s,  dealt with an over zealous marketing team who clamped down on student creativity, and the general Silicon Valley “fluff“ that I know plenty of us disliked. However, that being said, the people I met there were awesome. The rigor the school applied on us made us better in the long run, even if it did injure some of our GPA’s.

I was stuck on 2.3 and never saw an upgrade in the time I owned the phone.  I figured that Google would be a better actor and actual push updates, but boy was I in for a wild ride.<p>When I saw that 5.0 had been pushed, I upgraded, thinking that Google had vetted the release.  Instead what I had was wifi that never stayed connected and seg faults ALL over the place in virtually every app that I used on a regular basis, including apps developed by Google (hangouts, photos [which were trapped on the phone unless I wanted to connect external and download them], my SMS app, WeChat, Strava, Kindle ect).  They broke my phone, no way around it.  It was miserable and I stuck with it, because I paid for a premium device and wasn&#x27;t about to go blow another $650 on another device.

10301272,comment,10295487,10297367,0,0,gnaritas,,,"> in C++<p>You can&#x27;t blame me because some language you choose has limited meta abilities and doesn&#x27;t allow you to place asserts anywhere.  An assert is a generic concept that you can do in any language, and in languages with meta-facalities all of that is trivial to do, you&#x27;re too focused on &quot;where&quot; the assert is in your specific language, but DBC came from Eiffel, not C++, and checking conditions or blowing up is an assert no matter where it occurs.  DBC is cool, the places DBC chooses to do it&#x27;s asserts are also a big part of what DBC is, but it&#x27;s still all just some asserts in creative places under creative inheritance rules.",1443578434

Parcel Lockers [0] are a &quot;new&quot; innovation here but heaven help you if you try to get a courier parcel into one. Royal Mail = Good, DHL = Bad in this case and you might not even know until the seller receives the parcel back.<p>Fedex: Sorry, we missed you. (And the nearest depot is 30+ minutes away somewhere where buses don&#x27;t go and you can only collect after 4 on weekdays)<p>DHL: Sorry, we missed you.<p>UPS: Sorry, we missed you (or handed your parcel off to StarTrack, in which case it&#x27;ll go to a parcel locker, but you&#x27;ll never know if this is actually going to happen)<p>USPS, Royal Mail etc: Handed off to AusPost, can go to a parcel locker.<p>StarTrack: More expensive, more blue version of AusPost - semi private (?), the only courier that AusPost will let into the lockers<p>Toll: Sorry we missed you, there&#x27;s a redelivery fee in a lot of cases. Tried to start up a Parcel Locker competitor and then didn&#x27;t expand to many locations [1]. The website returned 500 errors for the first 6 months of its existence.<p>Amazon: We&#x27;re not going to actually tell you who is carrying your parcel because we outsourced it to iParcel who sometimes use UPS and sometimes use AusPost. Send an Amazon (US/UK/DE) parcel to an AusPost locker at your own peril<p>eBay: Most Aussie sellers use AusPost, so that works, but for some reason overseas orders go through some kind of Pitney Bowes reseller - see UPS, DHL, FedEx, Amazon above.<p>[0]: <a href=""http://lockers.auspost.com.au"" rel=""nofollow"">http://lockers.auspost.com.au</a>\n[1]: <a href=""http://parcelpoint.com.au"" rel=""nofollow"">http://parcelpoint.com.au</a>",1443578426

It seems to have gotten worse over time (I&#x27;ve been lurking several years longer than my current account). Now I occasionally come by threads with a large proportion of not-terrible comments greyed out, and it does make me avoid commenting anything that might be perceived unfavorably by someone. It also seems to encourage lots of throwaway accounts for single comments of unpopular opinions. I wish something could be done about this more than anything else, but I&#x27;m not sure what that would be.",1443578413

109576,comment,109443,109544,0,0,reitzensteinm,,,"The SSD should give slightly longer battery life, though probably only 10-20 minutes. Power consumption difference is about 2 watts vs 0.5 (the battery is 37 watt hour).<p>I'm disappointed too - I thought that everyone was crazy for attacking it in the way they did (soldered RAM, one USB port, no optical drive, pricey etc), but this really does make it unviable. Oh well, maybe Air rev 2 will fix it.",1202194614

I'd hate to blow an opportunity with an idea I had on something weird like this - why not just go a more traditional route?  This seems more risky than rewarding - but that's just my at-a-glance impression.",1202192506

I would make an exception to this: You may continue reading if a definition of ""living wage"" is given, but no definition has ever been given, to my knowledge.<p>A company's obligations are 1) To obey the law and 2) Meet the demands of the stockholders. That's it.",1202191548

For my application, I've tried it both ways and flash outperforms native firefox SVG support, let alone trying to get it to work in IE with the adobe plugin.<p>I think the big flash question remains whether to use long polling AJAX or flash for server push type applications.",1202191258

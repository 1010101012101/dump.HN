The former should be pretty accessible to a 13 year old and he’ll have a lot of time to wrestle with some of the more difficult concepts like Monads (although I think exposure to them at an early age will make them easier to grok since he doesn’t have to unlearn a bunch of other stuff). I highly recommend Real World Haskell (<a href=""http://book.realworldhaskell.org/read/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://book.realworldhaskell.org/read/</a>) if you do decide to go that route.<p>Apologies for a (related) tangent but I'm in a very similar situation (except that my little brother is 31). He has more artistic inclinations but in the past he's demonstrated an aptitude for mathematics and is generally good at problem solving. I've been teaching him some basic set theory and number theory in preparation for some actually programming.<p>My first thought is to teach him one high level language 
like Lisp followed by a low level language like C. On the other hand, JavaScript (+ HTML) has some of the best of both of those worlds with the added benefit of affording immediate gratification.  Any thoughts?<p>*Admittedly, my bro is a bit more motivated by financial considerations but I do think he will come to appreciate the beauty of programming if it is presented the right way.",1231613832

428150,comment,427292,428032,0,0,unalone,,,"Yeah. It ticks me off that Rand is associated with anarcho-capitalism (I think that's the phrase to describe people that want to replace government with corporations, no?). She isn't. She's all for government, but she has it restricted to three primary functions: depending people physically (with police), depending people morally (with law), and defending the nation (with a military). However, she says that these functions should be kept as minimal as possible, so as to give people maximum freedom.<p>It bugs me, because the Anthem argument ignores so much to make a snarky point (and Anthem is a terribly-written book, both Fountainhead and Atlas Shrugged are better-writ). It goes by this vision of Rand as a near-Nazi who wants conformity to her Galtian standard. She doesn't, and she says this repeatedly. Rather, she wants Galt to be the bringer of the message that you ought to do things using your own abilities, primarily for yourself.<p>She's fine with charity, as long as you give what you want to and not what you feel compelled to. She's fine with tax, as long as you're only being taxed for the services that directly apply to you. She's <i>entirely</i> fine with people disagreeing with her, provided they disagree based on their own moral convictions rather than on the convictions they read of others.

428115,comment,428018,428064,0,0,smanek,,,"I was fairly interested in the article. It was a little short on context but, from what I gathered, Horowitz et al. posit that college professors lean dramatically left and pressure their students to do so as well.<p>Based on my experience, this seems to hold pretty true, with a few notable exceptions (miron and pinker jump to mind) in most 'softer' departments (english/theology/psych/etc). In an english course I took last semester (ostensibly about democracy/law), papers I wrote that were critical of traditional liberal/socialist thought were critiqued more harshly than papers were more in line with the orthodoxy. Nothing flagrant enough to be improper (and I actually enjoyed the class), but the bias was definitely there.<p>Even in some of the harder sciences (chomsky and krugman, as two obvious examples) this seems to hold true.<p>Of course, professors should hold whatever political view they like, but I think the real question is if they are using their power to improperly/abusively coerce their students.<p>Personally, I haven't seen anything that rises to that level in college (but there was a horrible and grossly inappropriate bias at my high school), but I think that it is definitely worth investigating.<p>I don't want my professors preaching their politics any more than I want them preaching their religion.",1231611476

Objectivism ultimately became what is called ""the unlikiest cult."" Disagreeing with Rand was tantamount to heresy - much like disagreeing with L. Ron Hubbard is considered heresy in Scientology.<p>> <i>The cultic flaw in Ayn Rand’s philosophy of Objectivism is not in the use of reason, or in the emphasis on individuality, or in the belief that humans are self motivated, or in the conviction that capitalism is the ideal system. The fallacy in Objectivism is the belief that absolute knowledge and final Truths are attainable through reason, and therefore there can be absolute right and wrong knowledge, and absolute moral and immoral thought and action. For Objectivists, once a principle has been discovered through reason to be True, that is the end of the discussion. If you disagree with the principle, then your reasoning is flawed. If your reasoning is flawed it can be corrected, but if it is not, you remain flawed and do not belong in the group. Excommunication is the final step for such unreformed heretics.</i><p><a href=""http://www.spiralnature.com/phil/objectivism/unlikelycult.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.spiralnature.com/phil/objectivism/unlikelycult.ht...</a><p>> <i>Ayn always insisted that her philosophy was an integrated whole, that it was entirely self-consistent, and that one could not reasonably pick elements of her philosophy and discard others. In effect, she declared, ""It's all or nothing."" Now this is a rather curious view, if you think about it. What she was saying, translated into simple English, is: Everything I have to say in the field of philosophy is true, absolutely true, and therefore any departure necessarily leads you into error. Don't try to mix your irrational fantasies with my immutable truths. This insistence turned Ayn Rand's philosophy, for all practical purposes, into dogmatic religion, and many of her followers chose that path.</i><p><a href=""http://rous.redbarn.org/objectivism/Writing/NathanielBranden/BenefitsAndHazards.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://rous.redbarn.org/objectivism/Writing/NathanielBranden...</a><p>Nathaniel Branden was Rand's lover (while Rand was cheating on her husband) and the #2 person in Objectivism, until he got caught cheating on Rand and then excommunicated. Any member of Objectivism that refused to shun Branden (including members of his family) were likewise excommunicated.<p>The book <i>Why People Believe Weird Things</i> has a chapter on Objectivism that is well worth reading.

One of us doesn't like biscuits at all and another doesn't like custard creams (of which there are six). There are probably 30 biscuits of various sorts in the tin. How many should I take? I typically take two. Today I'm hungry and feel like having four but could easily go six to negate those calories I just lost doing a solid workout. What should I do? Stick with 2, go with four, or what the hell, go with six. I suppose I could do some sly ninja slides by the desk and take a couple at a time and hope nobody notices, build a stash in my own desk maybe. Sod it I'll be double greedy and go for eight. Is this too many? Don't forget, it is a rare nice day today and I'm feeling good.",1370527173

When I'm well, I do my best to explain the difficulties I have during an episode to try and avoid people feeling alienated. This is not something I can do effectively whilst ill.<p>The result of this seems to be that when I become unwell people in this group provide me with the best kind of support that they're equipped to give while others help me talk it out.<p>Unfortunately this hasn't been so easy to achieve with family members as it has with friends since they're so desperate to see me well, although things are improving. Fortunately (or unfortunately) my wife is also bipolar so I don't have that problem with her.<p>As to balancing talking it out vs. distraction? I rapid cycle so distraction can be very effective for dealing with short-term mood swings. If I notice that I'm distracting myself a lot then that's a sign that bigger trouble is just around the corner and is when I start to seek help. My wife and I discuss the state of our mental health very frequently so there's always a certain amount of discussion going on as well.",1370527152

Magazines and advertising should be banned from using Photoshop, too.<p>Being exposed to a variety of options and ways to have sex isn't bad. Anal sex can be quite fun, and if someone doesn't like it they're quickly going to say no. Rimming has its risks (like everything else) and isn't for everyone (like everything else), but it's pretty common and not horrendously unsafe. If you try to have sex without lube, you're quickly going to discover the problem. I can't speak for straight porn, but most porn that involves penetrative sex features condoms; if you're watching porn that was made in the last 10-20 years, it's really difficult not to see condoms in action.<p>Just about everybody reading this grew up with porn as teens (and possibly before) and we're not broken or messed up. Before the internet, teens got their hands on magazines and those generations aren't damaged by it either. If anything, I'd suspect teens today are better educated (and having better sex) than any generation before. Porn, together with improved sex education, has had a large role to play.<p>Saying that porn is bad because it teaches people different ways to have sex doesn't make sense. However, I will concede that the key here is sex education. If someone isn't receiving sex education they're not going to know about safe sex anyway, and restricting access to porn isn't going to make the situation any better. Porn should be supplemented by a decent sex education, and thankfully an adequate sex education is provided in the vast majority of the developed world.<p>If anything I'm grateful for all the porn I watched as a teen, and I think my sex life today is significantly better because of it. It taught me more than my prudish religious parents would (or could) and combined with my school's sex education classes, I was good to go have fun, figure out what was right for me, and do it without getting diseases along the way!",1370527114

So I would caution against a single answer.

Too many red flags springing from a delusional, narrow-minded view which looked no further than the bloated world of Valley startups. Hope mr. Author could cast his eye to some other corners of the world (no, even other parts of the States) and witness the bleak reality of a career called web development. Startups are just a small part, albeit the highlighted part of the system. What would you then call those developers who do back-breaking work, with a fraction of your starting salary, in a dead-end career path surrounded by an equally depressing environment? Low-class web developers? They are just like any other programmers out side, people who chose coding as a profession. Before all the perks, freedom and fun, this is a job. You work for your pay, period. I am sick and tired off seeing another article with a viewpoint through rose-tinted glass about values of coders. Enough is enough. </rant><p><conclusion>
There are overpaid programmers and there are underpaid programmers, everywhere in the world. I probably fall into the underpaid camp, that's why I feel annoyed seeing way too many articles with BS about the cool $100k IT jobs for fresh graduates. Where I stay, it probably takes an above average fresh grad 5-6 years of doing good jobs while hopping around (startup/MNC/whatever) to come somewhere close to $100. The media just does not ever cover the average Joe programmer's career path, but this is the reality.

There are a variety of reasons for why not, ignorance being high on the list, but perhaps the most prominent reason is that we expect our government to keep us safe, for better or worse.<p>If Americans are just now getting upset about this, it's ultimately our own fault, as this was the fairly logically expected result of the Patriot Act, and we haven't really done enough to get rid of it.  The 'right' response would have been to vote out every single Senator and House Representative that voted for such an egregious overstep on our liberties, but in reality, that ignores a whole slew of other interests those politicians may have supported.<p>If, for example, I am gun-toting civil rights advocate, a Senator that votes against an assault weapons ban comes out slightly ahead, even if that same Senator also voted for the Patriot Act.<p>If I'm a gay man, looking for federal recognition of marriage, I'm in the same boat.  Someone who votes for gay marriage, but also against privacy, comes out ahead.<p>The net, basically, is that privacy is nobody's 'hot-button' issue because even while somebody can espouse the inherent ignorance of the ""If you have nothing to hide..."" argument, we, for the most part, don't have anything to hide.  So while we don't acquiesce to these intrusions of privacy, we let them fall by the wayside in the wake of more important issues.<p>The real bitch of the matter, of course, is that Republicans are almost certainly going to scream 'outrage' to this new knowledge, even though it was Bush's policies that implemented their capability.  Meanwhile, democrats will likely 'defend Obama' because it would otherwise reflect negatively on the party to not do so.  In sort, it's political ammunition.  The outrage we see won't even be universal.  You'll probably see exceptions on either side (Lindsay Graham, Republican from South Carolina has already said this information ""doesn't bother"" him), and ultimately, if the 'blame' can be assigned in such a way that it advances someone's political agenda, that's what'll happen.",1370526625

There are two simple reasons for this: usage of Google Plus^W^WSearch has declined, and as a company were pouring all of our energy into fewer products. We think that kind of focus will make for a better  and more sociable  user experience.<p>Its been a long time since weve had this rate of change  it probably hasnt happened since the birth of social media in July 2011, with our superior social media platform, Google Plus. So today were officially folding a number of other products into Google Plus:<p>* YouTube will become Google Plus Video. Your YouTube will be just the same, youll just need a username you have government ID for. Dont worry  you can trust us with it.<p>* Google Maps API will become Google Plus Maps. Youll need to add your house, your workplace, your favourite retail experiences and your credit card number to your circles, then you can look up any place you want. You can opt out to Apple Maps any time you like.<p>* Google Docs got absorbed by Google Drive, which will become Google SUM(). Imagine the social of your spreadsheets being rated by all your friends! Once again, users who opt out are free to revel in the joys of Office 365.<p>* Google Voice App for BlackBerry will be discontinued once weve found both remaining BlackBerry users and notified them.<p>* Orkut, of course, is being kept.<p>We know youll be delighted with the Google Plus experience, with hundreds of millions of people every month delighted to be using Google Plus! Or products that require a profile on it. Its like Facebook without all the annoying people on it. Or any people. But the people on it love it with huge enthusiasm, just like the ones who loved Google Buzz before we shot that through the head too. Come onto Plus, or Vic will cry. You dont want to see Vic crying, do you? Asshole. You probably hurt puppies, too.<p>To ensure a smooth transition, were providing a three-month sunset period so you have sufficient time to find an alternate web-searching solution. Good luck on that one.

I don't think what I've created is all that great, in the scheme of things, but the fact that I put energy into it and think it's worth notifying the public means that at least at the subconscious level, I'm confident that what I've made has <i>some</i> merit.<p>So hearing praise is nice...I greatly appreciate it that people take the time out of their busy days (or HN browsing, and what have you) to check out the link and then take the time to say something positive...but the substance of the praise isn't usually constructive, because if I've done something good enough to praise, then theoretically, it's <i>natural</i> that people like it for the same reasons that I had for even making it.<p>But criticism...well, I usually self-critique pretty hard, but I don't think you can ever impartially critique yourself. When people rail on the shortcomings that I <i>know</i> exist, even just putting up a defense or an explanation is valuable to me, because I may have underestimated critical flaws...but if my judgment was right, it's still a useful critical process to re-examine those assumptions.<p>And of course, the gold standard is when you get criticism for things you didn't even realize were problems...and that's immensely helpful. To use that cliche saying, what's worse than harsh criticism is being ignored. And I think it's much easier to psychologically motivate yourself in times of criticism than it is to persevere when no one cares even enough to troll you.<p>And one last thought...the anonymous nature of the Internet does make it easy for strangers to flame each other. But the other side of the coin is that the personal nature of face-to-face contact often stifles much needed constructive criticism. Maybe HN's level of constructive-to-trolling criticism isn't perfect, but it's one of the better places to get free, useful analysis of your work by likeminded people.",1370526120

5832165,comment,5831491,5832059,1,0,einhverfr,,,"Hmmm this is a very difficult topic to really do justice to.  I don't think that Hayek is necessarily contrary to anything I am saying.  The problem though is a definition of virtue.<p>> You line up the list of virtuous things (curing AIDS, feeding poor people) and the list of valuable things (Ruby on Rails programmers, inanimate chunks of metal) and discover that they just don't line up. At all.<p>But the problem here is that without a framework for deciding what is virtuous, all you are doing is assigning your own measure of value.  In that regard your argument boils down to ""what you think is valuable is not necessarily a solution that lots of people will pay money for.""  But I do think that virtuous solutions are valuable to the extent they are virtuous.  A cure for cancer would be worth, I would expect, thousands or millions of times what a hollywood blockbuster would be.<p>However there are limits to this analysis.  While I think valuable = virtuous with regard to <i>solutions</i> it doesn't necessarily follow that the coal miner is less virtuous than the Ruby programmer.  Wages are determined in ways that both do and don't resemble market economics as even Adam Smith noted (he saw wage levels as being indicative of negotiating power differences between various professions).<p>So my caution is to avoid looking at wages (ruby programmers vs coal miners) in the same way you look at solutions (cure for cancer vs the next big MTV hit).",1370524320

Being distracted from the problems, even if only for a short while, can be blissful and hugely appreciated.<p>> On the other hand, I'm usually happy to be treated differently by people that have had similar experiences to me. I can often communicate to them in a sentence things which would take hours of conversation with somebody who'd not been there before.<p>I very much agree with both parts of what you've said here. I'm curious if & how you tend to balance between the two?<p>Generally when I'm having a bad time just having some casual distraction works fine, especially from someone who doesn't know what's wrong.<p>When I'm stuck in a rut, just having a few friends who can stop me bullshitting and keep me talking works wonders.",1370523643

5832090,comment,5831848,5831983,1,0,michaelochurch,,,"Cancer can kill quickly but doctors rarely give specific timelines, at least in the US. ""30 days"" seems suspicious, if only because most doctors hate giving specific amounts of time. (If the person lives half as long, then the family gets angry because they thought there was more time. If the person lives much longer-- sometimes an order of magnitude more, given the complexities of misdiagnosis, new treatments, etc.-- then there's a different kind of blowback.)<p>I would guess that it's metastatic cancer. Mentioning the liver is an indication. Once the liver's involved, cancer gets very hard to treat. Typical chemotherapy is killing the cancer by flooding the body with poison, and doing that when the liver's compromised is often fruitless (and painful).<p>Most likely, the doctors have stopped treatment, in which case 30 days is a reasonable median, but he'll be essentially functional until the last 2 weeks. However, there are cases (although they're quite rare) of people living for months or even years after that happens. Spontaneous remission is uncommon (less than 1%) but it does occur. That's yet another reason why doctors don't like giving specific timelines.",1370523631

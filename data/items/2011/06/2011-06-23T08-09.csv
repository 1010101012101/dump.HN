On the one hand, the compiler will curse you out for trying to use a non-const iterator in a const function (sheesh, what kind of an idiot are you, anyway)? On the other hand, you can read and write to every bit of memory allocated to your application, and it will stand by and do nothing. I think the number of applications which had buffer overflows at least at some point is statistically indistinguishable from 100%.<p>Try this hotel analogy: you go to a hotel in which you once stayed, and tell them that you're going to dump every bit of possessions and furnishings in all the rooms outside on the street, rifle through them, set them on fire, then photograph all their guests in the nude and distribute the pictures.

He also said that Oracle has so far kept their promise to keep developing MySQL and that Percona has pulled their upstream changes.<p>Besides that, if Oracle decides to stop supporting MySQL, Percona is a drop-in replacement, as is MariaDB, developed by some of the original MySQL developers.

But that doesn't hold for immigration laws. Immigration laws are made by one group of people that is completely unaffected by them for an entirely different group of people to respect.<p>That's why, in my view, immigration laws have no legitimacy whatsoever. Where you are born is complete chance. Some of those who happen to be born in better places think that it serves them well to keep others out in order to keep that unfair competitive advantage. Sometimes it's the very same people who pride themselves of being in favor of free trade, a level playing field, antiprotectionist, etc. A ridiculously disingenuous position considering the most important thing everyone has to trade is their own time, effort and skills.<p>They find all kinds of spurious reasons to defend this unfair and blatently self-serving position. One of the worst is that all countries have immigration laws. This argument mixes up practical matters with ethical ones. Obviously, it's difficult for one country to unilaterally abolish all immigration laws.

Yes, it sucks that being born on the right side of an imaginary line determines many of your future opportunities. Agreed. Let's change that. Agreed.<p>But meanwhile, there can't be anarchy. Just because you think it's unfair, you (or your parents) can't go ahead and break the rules, fake to be citizen of a place that you are not, and after enough water has passed under the bridge, come out and expect for everything to be the same, just because you lived your life in a commendable way after that.<p>I think it's unfair and insulting that he got the opportunity to attend schools in the US, get to do internships in the US, while thousands of children from the Philippines were not smuggled across the border and have to cope with life without such opportunities.

OK, I admit there is a kind of madhouse logic to this which I can't refute. There is already a flood of patches that I need to apply about every 5 minutes to something or other, and that's just the vulns that got identified and reported.<p>I certainly agree that nobody will be able to stop this - developers want the API, users want the games.<p>WebGL is currently turned on in Chrome 12, and the only way to turn it off is to add -disable-webgl to the command line.  Which essentially means you can assume it's on everywhere, including on the computer of your bank's manager. This is what people miss when they say you can turn it off for yourself.<p>The security aspects of WebGL seem like they were banged out in about 10 minutes. I encourage all to read  the Khronos paper on security (<a href=""http://www.khronos.org/webgl/security/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.khronos.org/webgl/security/</a>), and compare the level of presentation to anything which gets accepted at a security conference.<p>I don't know why I keep returning to this. I certainly don't think that WebGL is the end of the world. There will be some more holes and some more patches. I just think this is another case of the web development world shirking its responsibility to bring real security to browsing (what happened to all those projects which used virtualization to isolate sessions, which I first heard about 4 years ago?), and instead piling on more features without thinking the implications through.",1308816648

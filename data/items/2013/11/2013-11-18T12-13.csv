And if they have been pushed, you have to go to the remote repo and manually remove them there too. And everyone else who has pulled them, will need to manually remove them.",1384779551

6754065,comment,6751492,6752377,22,0,pron,,,"Google fascinates me. I think it is possibly the first organization in history that embodies concepts from dystopic fiction. Putting a real face to those dystopic ideas can give us a sense of what a true dystopia looks like (short answer: it looks deceptively nice; the horror reveals itself only on close inspection).<p>You mention work. As you say, Google does not just want their employees&#x27; time. They want their complete identification with the company. In a way, they want their souls.<p>As for business, Google is a company whose business model is tricking people into sharing as much private information with the company, and then using this information for profit.<p>One of the most interesting things about Google is their &quot;don&#x27;t be evil&quot; motto. I want to write a complete literary interpretation of it some other time, but here are the highlights. Obviously, it&#x27;s a short and catchy motto that is not intended to be taken too seriously, but that does not preclude literary interpretation.<p>First, let&#x27;s consider the motto as a whole. It could be a motto for anyone, but how come it&#x27;s Google&#x27;s and not mine (or yours)? The reason is that they accept the premise that corporations do often turn out to be &quot;evil&quot; (whatever that means). This is analogous to the reason physicians swear to &quot;do no harm&quot;; they swear it because doctors can easily do harm.<p>Now let&#x27;s take the motto apart and analyze it word by word. First, the word &quot;evil&quot;. The word assumes such a thing exists and can be recognizable. Second, the word &quot;be&quot;. It implies that evil is something you <i>are</i>, not something you <i>do</i>. Lastly, the word &quot;don&#x27;t&quot;. It assumes that you can choose not to &quot;be&quot; &quot;evil&quot;, and implies that those who &quot;are&quot; &quot;evil&quot; are so because they chose to be that way.<p>If a motto can guide a corporation, and if this motto guides Google, we can see why they&#x27;ve become so monstrously terrifying. Evil is not always easily recognizable. Often, it&#x27;s in the eyes of the beholder. Second, evil is rarely something you are, and almost always something you do. Third, &quot;evil&quot; creeps up on you, and is often the result of the best intentions. People other than James Bond villains don&#x27;t choose to be evil. Similarly you can&#x27;t simply choose not to be. To abstain from &quot;evil&quot; you must be vigilant. You must constantly analyze your actions and their consequences separately from your intentions, and listen to other viewpoints.<p>Going back to dystopias, well known ones, like Orwell&#x27;s 1984, insist that the masses love their oppressors rather than fear them. This is a crucial point that is largely overlooked when people discuss the NSA surveillance scandal. It is crucial because true power, absolute oppression, cannot exist if its wielder is generally considered suspect.<p>When I read 1984 many years ago I couldn&#x27;t understand that. Do people not notice that they&#x27;re being manipulated and exploited? Can they actually <i>enjoy</i> being exploited? Now we have the answer.",1384779525

6754055,comment,6751710,6753524,3,0,Lazare,,,"I did some digging, and it seems that the rules for FBA are highly variable for different vendors.  Larger vendors, or vendors who have been part of the FBA program for a long time, seem to still be able to comingle, but there&#x27;s a lot of confusion about it.  No one quite seems sure if it&#x27;s something that only old vendors get (grand-fathered in from back when it was a standard part of FBA) or something that large/trustworthy vendors get (offered on a case-by-case basis).  It might even be both.<p>As best as I can tell, it seems that commingling is happening today, and may account for the bulk of FBA transactions (due to a few very large/old vendors still doing it), but the overwhelming majority of FBA vendors cannot commingle, many have no idea that commingling even <i>exists</i>, and if you signed up today you would not be able to commingle.",1384779232
6754053,comment,6751492,6753150,37,0,elastoplast,,,"I work at Google, have done for about 7 years now. This is my first comment at HN.<p>I think your comment about &quot;not coercive&quot; is insightful. The biggest change I&#x27;ve seen over time here is that at the start, people never talked about what users should or should not do. They were treated as people who would use our products, or not, and that was A-OK.<p>The subtle trend that underlies a lot of this recent outpouring of dismay is that these days, this view has changed. It&#x27;s not about chasing profit (it&#x27;s still extremely rare at Google to see anything approaching a budget). It&#x27;s not about being evil. It&#x27;s that these days users are increasingly treated as if they were sheep that need to be herded around.<p>This trend is evidence in many different ways. The big push for Google+ comes from Larry&#x27;s fear of Facebook. He got really scared a few years ago that Facebook was going to &quot;win&quot; in any area they competed in, simply through being social, regardless of how good their actual product was. Photos was taken as the canonical example: Facebook Photos was inferior in almost every way to PicasaWeb but it won handily in terms of market share because it was social (or so the theory goes). Messaging seemed similar, surveys showed the younger generation didn&#x27;t use email anymore, it was all on Facebook. So at the time it was thought that Facebook were going to take on every one of Google&#x27;s core products and win, simply through having the social graph. So that fear drove the massive investment in Google+ and the desire to win at any cost.<p>Of course this strategy has not worked, as was predictable. Google+ is an excellent social network, but people already had one and didn&#x27;t care to change. Also, the threat from Facebook has never really seemed to materialise in the huge way Larry thought it would.<p>Unfortunately this fear drove a long series of mental rationalisations. People would use Google+, employees were told, because it would be good for them. They might not realise it <i>now</i>, but Google+ would make everything better, and that&#x27;s why it&#x27;s so important that they all sign up. Real Names might be unpopular to start with, but then people would realise the benefits and they&#x27;d all be happy.<p>The same thinking has driven a bunch of other problems. That damn red alerting bell that Google+ users all get? It can&#x27;t be switched off, rationale: &quot;if we allow users to switch it off because it&#x27;s too noisy, after we fix that they won&#x27;t switch it back on and then they&#x27;d end up in a worse state. It&#x27;s really better for people in the long term that there be no way to disable it&quot;.<p>Unfortunately Larry is so committed to this fear-driven social strategy that he can&#x27;t mentally accept that a large population of users is never going to be excited about or use Google+. For him, if Google+ loses, Google itself will become entirely irrelevant a short time later. It&#x27;s literally an existential crisis. This places Vic in a very powerful position where he&#x27;s able to get whatever he wants, and pushback from the lower ranks is ignored in order to seem to be making progress with this &quot;better for the users&quot; social integration.<p>I guess YouTube comments are a good recent example of this. Presumably someone at the bottom of the YouTube org understood that removing character limits and allowing links would immediately cause floods of spam, but  the &quot;social is better&quot; meme is now so unmoveable amongst management that these sorts of practical considerations (which would once have been the dominant factor in decision making) get tossed aside.<p>I don&#x27;t know if Google will change, but unless Larry wakes up and realises Facebook isn&#x27;t going to kill his business, I think it will continue down the current path for a long time yet.",1384779216

The evaluation board for one of those is about $2k, though obviously the FGPA itself would hopefully be lower in price. I can&#x27;t seem to find any open pricing for the virtex line. They say using a larger FGPA would allow addressing more DRAM, but of course, that raises your chip costs as well. You&#x27;ll have to add to that small volume PCB costs, as well as the cost of the hosting server node.<p>Compare all that to a $2k 1U Xeon with 32GB of ram and dual 10GbE and the prices aren&#x27;t that dissimilar. Also one is a research project while the other is a commodity a phone call and fedex away.<p>My guess would be you&#x27;d need the FPGA design in high volume for the costs to work out. So it&#x27;d be good as an appliance product for a vendor, but unless you&#x27;re google/facebook huge trying to build this sort of thing yourself would likely be a boondoggle. The exception is the latency performance: you&#x27;d have trouble duplicating that with the commodity server design.

Tech is no different on that front, where it is different is that, unlike your department store, tech is something that you carry with you almost all the time. Understandably, people do get upset by this a lot more than what a similar change at a department store would result in.<p>I have been a fan of Google and have used a lot of its products over time. The company has been changing for a while now and a significant part of that change is that it is making the transition from being someone in the background (the advertising business), to someone who wants a front seat in everything digital. Consequently, its product line will also start to reflect that change.<p>And one of the obvious outcomes of such a change is that a lot of us who have used Google&#x27;s products extensively from the early days are no longer the primary target group for the company. Early adopters rarely form the mass market and it is the same in the case of Google. Products like Gmail were never front line products. These happened to exist by leveraging existing tech within the company. With Glass, Android etc., these products are now moving to the front lines for the company.<p>I still use Gmail extensively, most of my video is consumed on Youtube, I still use search, Android and Drive (for online docs & Keep, not file sync). My main Google account does not have G+ on it and while things are not perfect, it is so far usable. I&#x27;ve rarely commented on YT, can&#x27;t rate anything anymore on Play Store, but I can live with all that, at least for now.<p>I fully expect the situation to worsen for people like me in the years to come on Google, but that is OK. It will eventually lead to newer products coming into the market and that is always a good thing. Email will be the first thing I will switch and I think that will happen before the second half of 2014 swings around.<p>All said and done, I have been happy with Google being around -- they revolutionized search, made email an enabler than a pain (better storage & spam management) and every now and then I discover something awesome on YT that makes so grateful that it exists. It has given me much more than what it (and NSA ;-)) probably has taken from me.<p>Irony in all of this is that all this while everyone has criticized Google for being an ill-organized one-trick-pony!

Do you?<p>I don&#x27;t consider myself a 10x developer, nevermind a perfect developer.  But I still think you&#x27;re continuing to overstate the difficulty of minimizing the combinatorial effects and general difficulty of handling missing permissions.  You can certainly make a herculean task out of it if you want to, however.<p>> Have you developed apps for Android as an indie developer? Or for iOS?<p>Depends on how you&#x27;re defining both &quot;developed apps&quot; and &quot;indie&quot;.<p>> How much extra time would you want to spend to cover corner cases like this, instead of adding features that might actually improve your revenues or ratings?<p>While I certainly wouldn&#x27;t relish platform mandated &quot;busywork&quot; as a developer, I&#x27;ve seen much worse and much more pointless work than such.<p>> How likely is it that you&#x27;d successfully handle all 255 extra permutations with no real testing?<p>How likely is it that you&#x27;d successfully handle all execution of your app <i>even with</i> real testing?  For anything sufficiently complex, statistics will eventually catch up with you, and your chance will, when rounded, come to a nice and magical number... nil.  Zero.<p>Mistakes will happen, complexity will happen, and removing features in an attempt to prevent the inevitable from eventually striking is the wrong answer.  Don&#x27;t get me wrong, permissions sets are a fine way to help reduce that complexity without necessarily harming the other goals<i>.  And it&#x27;d be nice to have it done for you.  And it&#x27;d be nice to have it done as atomic sets.  But I remain unconvinced it&#x27;s unreasonable to manage without those niceties.<p>( </i> although as a matter of personal taste, if I want to kill INTERNET and just read my chat app&#x27;s logs or settings I&#x27;d like to be able to do that -- and can at the OS level by turning off both mobile data and wifi, your monetization strategy be damned.)",1384777398

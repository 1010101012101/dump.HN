Craigslist isn't stopping Padmapper from being built, its stopping Padmapper from using <i>Craigslist data</i>.

Don't confuse the two things.<p>For instance, many payroll companies have truly awful sites, yet people use them since they have no other choice.<p>As a specific example, searching for an apartment should not mean <i>reading every single listing</i> in order to discern where the property is, what features are available, and what conditions apply. That people post the same listing repeatedly until it is rented is not helping matters.<p>eBay, which is arguably still quite primitive, has much better filtering options, alerts, and a single listing that persists until the auction is completed. Craiglist is a series of random, repetitive posts with only a minimum of categorization.<p>Padmapper provided a superior way to navigate listing data and present it in a much more meaningful presentation. Being able to ""favorite"" listings helps when filtering.",1343149176

It turns out that the game was prominently listed on a popular pirate board, but was buried deeply on the app store.<p>Combine that with a tendency for pirates to install huge numbers of games that they'll never likely play, and a 90% piracy rate isn't surprising.<p>Personal anecdote:  Massive sales cause me to buy games that I'll likely never play.   I just dropped over $50 on Steam because of their massive summer sale.   $20 went to the latest Humble Bundle.   A few months ago I bought a bunch of games for 10 freaking cents each on the Google store.  I've purchased two sequels and one in-app since for those games, but my total outlay is still well under $10.<p>So I believe that the biggest problems on both Android and iOS are pricing and discovery.

On accuracy, there is a difference both in how the numbers are calculated (we use our financial modeling back-end) and the quality of the assumptions used - we have local data sets for transaction expenses, real estate taxes, income taxes etc - NYT uses default values, like 28% for your marginal income tax.  This means they end up overstating the tax advantage for lower incomes and understating it for higher incomes).

Clearly Apple doesn't fit this definition, as they are both making and selling tons of devices that use these patents.<p>In fact, there's nothing you can really say that indicates Apple is misusing patents. They are, unfortunately, using patents exactly the way patents are meant to be used. Patents are <i>meant</i> to stifle innovation in a direction that's already been taken. It's their purpose: exclusive rights for however many years in exchange for public disclosure. The only critique that I think can be made of Apple's use of patents at this point is that they're using them at all (which is a perfectly valid critique, mind you).",1343148037

If, say, you're charging $100 an hour, don't take on customers who aren't used to paying that type of rate.

I invoice net 30 and on longer projects, have a simple condition that I will stop work when an invoice is 60 days overdue.<p>If you really want to encourage early payment, then implement something like a 2/10 net 30, which is a 2% discount if the invoice is paid within 10 days.",1343148004

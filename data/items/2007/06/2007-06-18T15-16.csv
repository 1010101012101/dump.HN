And upon recommendation of my webhost(a2b2) Debian and Ubuntu would be the best choice as I only have a small VPS to begin with. So what do YCers think? which should I choose? ",1182182353

28900,comment,28858,28864,0,0,koolmoe,,,"Winer is not using the example of Jobs to refute the idea that younger people are good at startups.  In fact, he acknowledges that younger people often have the willingness to accept risk and enthusiasm that their older counterparts may not have.<p>He's trying to refute Wilson's idea that younger people are developing the design patterns of the web while older people are used to reading the newspaper, watching TV and generally out of touch with what's going on with technology.  Steve Jobs seems to be a pretty good example of a person whose ideas about technology have improved with age.<p>In any case, the idea that the <i>average</i> twentysomething is more plugged in than the <i>average</i> fortysomething may be valid, but it should be obvious that the situation changes when you are comparing individuals who are interested in and devoted to technology development.",1182181142
28899,comment,28870,28870,0,0,tx,,,"I agree with lupin_sansei. The article lacks a credible source to back up their conclusions. In fact, I believe just recently I stumbled upon some numbers that suggest otherwise: <i>because</i> of the Internet people get caught up in the net of social marketing and start buying more books: <i>""OMG!! everybody is reading this, I gotta buy one too""</i> Several books became very popular this way: Freakonomics, Tipping Point, Long Tail.<p>Seriously, without this largely Internet-based hype about Long Tail I cannot see an article like that (about something obvious) make a book, and a popular one.<p>",1182180687

Imagine if 10% of the apps on iPhone came from Flash. If that was the case, then ensuring Flash didn’t break release to release would be a big deal, much bigger than any other compatibility issues. Since Apple doesn’t have access to Flash CS5’s runtime library code or compiler frontend, they might be put in a position where they would need to coordinate with Adobe to resolve those issues. Shipping a new release where Apple breaks any specific application, even a top seller, is not an issue if the release is compelling, most apps work, and Apple has the option of working with the vendor to help them fix their app. Shipping a release where they break a large percentage of apps is not generally an option. Letting any of these secondary runtimes develop a significant base of applications in the store risks putting Apple in a position where the company that controls that runtime can cause delays in Apple’s release schedule, or worse, demand specific engineering decisions from Apple, under the threat of withholding the information necessary to keep their runtime working.""",1271086648

Of course it's perfectly possible for someone who works for a conservative think tank to have useful and interesting things to say, but in practice I tend to find that such people give a high enough priority to pushing a particular agenda -- as, after all, they are being paid to do -- that I can't trust anything they say without independent verification. (The same may well be true of people working for think tanks on the other side, but there seem to be considerably fewer of them about.)",1271085408

1259304,comment,1259010,1259010,0,0,mdasen,,,"It isn't merely getting people to want world peace.<p>First, what are we in now?  It isn't world conflict or world war.  No one wants that.  Conflict occurs because two people want the same thing or think they're entitled to the same thing.  Palestinians and Israelis don't fight each other because they think it's fun.  There's a conflict there over things like access to/control of land.  Heck, in non-violent ways there are conflicts on the web all the time.  Facebook ""controls"" a lot of our online identity and I'm sure a lot of us are unhappy with that order and, should a viable and open alternative come around, we might all throw in with that new option to re-arrange the order of the web.<p>So, in a sense, peace requires everyone to accept an order - or at least accept it enough to forgo any violent attempts to change the order.  That's easy to accept when you're on top. I'm guessing none of us on here are likely to want much violence and non-peace, but we're likely on top on a global scale.  We fit into that group of people that are #2 in the article - the Americans (or any first-world people) who just don't want to be attacked, but will use things like an army to prevent attack.<p>I mean, it's easy to say that people just need to want peace, but everyone kinda wants a different peace.  Not that I love talking about Israel and Palestine, but it's easy to get up and say that Palestinians just need to <i>want</i> peace. But they do want peace - just a peace where they have something they don't have right now (and for different Palestinians, it'll be a different thing).  When we think of peace in the US, we probably think of it in terms of the current order of the world just without conflict and war - with the US on top.  However, it's always nice to be on top and there are people who would like a stable system where they maintained that top position.<p>The problem is that the world is not egalitarian or fair. Worse, even when it is fair, some perceive it as unfair.  When you perceive great injustice, you might see violence as a possible avenue to correct that injustice.  That could be ugly capitalists spreading disease and poverty to the poor; that could be G-dless communists oppressing freedom and imprisoning people for basic human rights; that could be religious infidels who think they're on top and use their might to deny your true G-d.<p>But what is fair and righteous varies by person. I think that as we make our world more fair, the level of conflict will lessen.  More and more people will view participation in the system as good and that violence against it is more unfair than fair.<p>Think about it this way: you're a police officer in a community.  If you're in a community where people perceive the system as fair and good, people violating the system are likely to be reported, people are likely to be helpful in your investigations, etc.  That's a good situation.  It means that, for the people in your community, the system is fair enough that people think flagrant disregard for the rule of law is a bad thing.  However, it isn't hard to imagine the other side - disenfranchised people who don't see the system as fair.  In that case, even the non-combatants (so to speak) aren't jumping to help the system.  Combatants are seen as somehow justified - or at least that the system is just as bad as the combatants against it.<p>I think that there are likely to always be combatants against the order. The key is to make the order so fair and so just that onlookers aren't neutral.  In those cases, many would-be combatants would be discouraged from the lack of support from their surroundings and combat just wouldn't work.  I mean, one of the biggest problems that forces in Afghanistan and Iraq face is figuring out who is a combatant.  If all the non-combatants ratted out the combatants (because they saw them as fighting an unjust fight against justice), it would be easy.  But, there's the potential that many might see them as fighting a just fight - or a neutral fight - in which case, you might not want to inform on them since they aren't the unjust.",1271085318

You either use the best allocator library you can find or end up having a half-baked allocator of your own on top of a poor default allocator library.
A good allocator is essential for performance.<p>Writing a good allocator is not trivial so your home-made allocator is likely to be slower, consume more memory than an optimized generic allocator, and exhibit all kinds of weird random hiccups when a critical malloc() or free() happens exactly when the library can't avoid housekeeping anymore and goes into a costly cleanup mode. An optimized allocator has loads of knowhow in guarding against these corner cases, both algorithmically and by having empirical special cases to help amortize the cost of maintenance.<p>I've seen many programs that couldn't possibly have predicted their allocations any better but were still stuck until an alternate allocator was bolted in and the juices began to flow smoothly again.<p>I expect a modern allocator to adapt to various use cases, from managing large variable-size chunks of memory to intelligently pooling a thousands and thousands of small objects of one size.

They provide a lot of spiritual and psychological benefits for a lot of people, but have also wrecked a lot of people. Cocaine, heroin, amphetamines (including Rx) and alcohol are probably the worst, as far as I've seen. Psychedelics don't seem to be as damaging in general-- I think it could even be argued that alcohol is more dangerous than psilocybin-- but becoming an acid-head is a terrible idea. I find it astonishing that, although psychedelic experiences can be very interesting and illuminating, the vast majority of frequent drug users (e.g. 2-4x/month LSD users) are exhaustingly boring people.<p>Psychedelics are a completely different class of drug, of course, from coke and alcohol. Most people lump together utterly different behaviors (cocaine at a party vs. shrooms in the woods) into ""doing drugs"", and that isn't really fair.

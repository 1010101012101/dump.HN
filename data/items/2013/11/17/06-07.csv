6747916,comment,6747833,6747833,17,0,nkurz,,,"Eben Moglen is a law professor at Columbia.  He&#x27;s also one of the smartest people in the world on the social and legal issues of the internet.  This is the third in a series of talks he&#x27;s given for the Software Freedom Law Center.  Despite the URL, it&#x27;s not really about Snowden -- it&#x27;s about privacy and it&#x27;s essential role in the future of democracy.<p>Quoting at length to encourage you to read the whole piece:<p><pre><code>  I would urge you also to consider that privacy is an \n  ecological rather than a transactional substance. This is \n  a crucial distinction from what you are taught to believe \n  by the people whose job it is to earn off you.\n\n  Those who wish to earn off you want to define privacy as a  \n  thing you transact about with them, just the two of you. \n  They offer you free email service, in response to which \n  you let them read all the mail, and that’s that. ...\n\n  This is a convenient fraudulence. Another misdirection,\n  misleading, and plain lying proposition. Because—as I \n  suggested in the analytic definition of the components of\n  privacy—privacy is always a relation among people. It is\n  not transactional, an agreement between a listener or a\n  spy or a peephole keeper and the person being spied on.\n\n  If you accept this supposedly bilateral offer, to provide\n  email service for you for free as long as it can all be \n  read, then everybody who corresponds with you has been \n  subjected to the bargain, which was supposedly bilateral\n  in nature. \n\n  ...\n\n  Environmental law is not law about consent. It’s law about \n  the adoption of rules of liability reflecting socially \n  determined outcomes: levels of safety, security, and \n  welfare.\n\n  When you take a subject which has previously been subject  \n  to environmental regulation and you reduce it to \n  transactionality—even for the purpose of trying to use \n  market mechanisms to reduce the amount of pollution going \n  on—you run into people who are deeply concerned about the \n  loss of the idea of a socially established limit. You must \n  show that those caps are not going readily to be lifted in \n  the exhilarating process, the game, of trading.\n\n  But with respect to privacy we have been allowed to fool \n  ourselves—or rather, we have allowed our lawyers to fool \n  themselves and them to fool everybody else—into the \n  conclusion that what is actually a subject of   \n  environmental regulation is a mere matter of bilateral \n  bargaining. A moment’s consideration of the facts will \n  show that this is completely not true.\n\n  ...\n\n  It is technically feasible for Google to make Gmail into a \n  system which is truly secure and secret for its users. In \n  which mail is encrypted—using public keys in a web of \n  trust—within users’ own computers, in their browsers, and \n  in which email at rest at Google is encrypted using \n  algorithms to which the user rather than Google has the \n  relevant keys.\n\n  This means donating Gmail’s scant profit to the world, \n  consistent with the idea that the Net belongs to its users \n  throughout the world. Which, in the long run it is good \n  for Google to be seen not only to believe, but to act \n  upon.\n\n  There are many, many, very thoughtful, capable, dedicated   \n  people at Google who must choose either between doing what \n  is right or naming what is wrong.\n\n  The situation at Facebook is different. Facebook is strip-\n  mining human society.\n\n  The idea of social sharing, in a context in which the \n  service provider reads everything and watches everybody \n  watch, is inherently unethical.\n\n  But we need no more from Facebook than truth in labeling.\n\n  We need to no rules, no punishments, no guidelines. We \n  need nothing but the truth.\n\n  Facebook should lean in and tell its users what it does.\n\n  It should say &quot;We watch you every minute that you’re here. \n  We watch every detail of what you do, what you look at, \n  who you’re paying attention to, what kind of attention \n  you’re paying, what you do next, and how you feel about it \n  based on what you search for.\n\n  “We have wired the web so that we watch all the pages that \n  you touch that aren’t ours, so that we know exactly what \n  you’re reading all the time, and we correlate that with \n  your behaviour here.”\n\n  To every parent Facebook should say, “Your children spend \n  hours every day with us. Every minute of those hours, we \n  spy upon them more efficiently than you will ever be able \n  to.”\n\n  Only that, just the truth. That will be enough.\n</code></pre>\nAmen.",1384671448

Every individual user has the ability to not participate in some of the really awful shit that goes down...but, groupthink and a culture that celebrates the worst of it (&quot;none of us are as cruel as all of us&quot;), leads to some truly awful behavior. And, it is so often white males targeting women (and, worse, young girls).<p>People with privilege are rarely aware of their privilege, and 4chan is a great exhibition of that. It&#x27;s possibly useful as a tool for seeing just how much people <i>don&#x27;t</i> see how awful their community can be, and how much oppressive behavior is tolerated and celebrated. We&#x27;ve got thousands of years of oppression to undo. I&#x27;m calling it out, not because I&#x27;m &quot;sensitive&quot;, but because I&#x27;ve had some of this shit explained to me...I&#x27;ve had my own oppressive behavior called out to me. And, now that I see it, and have begun to understand it, it&#x27;s my job as a white male ally in a centuries-old struggle to call it out when I see it.<p>It&#x27;s not white knighting, and it&#x27;s not sensitivity. 4chan isn&#x27;t hurting my feelings or making me mad. 4chan is just doing what white men have done throughout history: Enjoying their position of privilege to make fun of those with less power. And, I recognize it for what it is because I&#x27;ve done it, too. The only surprising thing about it is how much most 4channers think they <i>aren&#x27;t</i> acting like every prior generation of white men in the face of being asked to treat women and people of color like equals. They genuinely believe they are a different breed, above race, and gender, and identity; all the while promoting the same old shit.",1384671345

While I know a lot of people by their online handles, I also know their real name, and I typically choose to enter that real name into my phone.  Maybe this is uncommon, but if not, if you&#x27;re building a communication platform, it does make some sense for the user-entered data to follow this format.  Is there some intrinsic reason that someone be referred to as &quot;Jonathan Rockway&quot; when you send them a message via the SMS protocol, but &quot;jrockway&quot; if you send that same message via Jabber?  It then follows to wonder: if you&#x27;re talking to your friends via YouTube, why would you use yet another nickname?<p>Maybe what people want is a unique identifier that only they know, and then choose to share a different name with different groups of people?<p>I don&#x27;t have any strong feelings one way or the other, but I am interested in what other people have to say.",1384670984

Can&#x27;t recall the specifics but I believe it essentially skips the technical aspects of the modern era instead focusing on history leading up to the US Federal Reserve and some subsequent well known major events in an effort to raise concern about the systemic problems of fractional reserve and well known derivative issues versus the realities of globalization.<p>For example the fallibility of national regulators, corruption of financial institutions, challenges of post-facto manual slapdash policing versus things like HFT and off-market trading, etc.<p>Notably, I don&#x27;t recall any mention of SWIFT or the ISO&#x27;s centralized currency register.<p>Most of the documentaries I&#x27;ve seen are pretty much like that one: comfortable topics people feel are approachable and that they can easily acquire public faces to discuss. Dated enough to be out of view. Already discussed enough to be not too controversial. Often with slightly corrupting funding influences, eg. from the BBC.<p>As for investigative journalism at the heart of the matter, I&#x27;ve never seen any.

It seems like value in web ecosystem is changing from &quot;views&quot; to &quot;verbs&quot; -- like, share, etc.. actions that spread content rather than passively consuming it. Google has based its business on monetizing &quot;views&quot; and its competitors (fb) are building on verbs.<p>Also, Google has to maintain a forest of separate identities for everyone. (youtube, gmail, g+, etc). It&#x27;s super annoying just to maintain one login. There&#x27;s huge business value in consolidating those, even without adding features.<p>Finally, Youtube comments are a cesspool. Even when they&#x27;re not racist or threatening, they&#x27;re immature and, at best &quot;wow that&#x27;s awesome&quot;. They drive viewers away. I bet google wants to try to do-over comments in a way that makes them useful to people, not unsettling.<p>And I would hesitate to call it a disaster.

Management&#x27;s stated reasoning goes something like:<p><pre><code>  * It&#x27;s silly to force users to have separate accounts for\n    Google services because most users would prefer to have\n    Gmail, Docs/Drive, YouTube, Calendar, and so on under the\n    same account/identity.\n\n  * Users who want to have separate public identities will\n    create pseudonymous &quot;Pages&quot; for each of their identities.\n    These pages will still be owned by the same account, so\n    the user only has to log in once.\n\n  * Users who are strongly opposed to a unified Google account\n    are a sufficiently small population that it is acceptable\n    to inconvenience them if doing so improves the experience\n    of every other user.\n</code></pre>\nBy itself, these arguments are reasonable and could probably have been implemented without too much trouble (though &quot;Pages&quot; continues to be a confusing and unclear term). The problem is that the new account system was introduced at the exact same time as a social network, with the /same name/, and that the social network decided to inject a hard requirement of Facebook-style name validation rules into the new profile system.<p>Now the term &quot;Google+&quot; has become so strongly connected with the Google+ social network (and its infamous names policy) that any attempt to expand the Google+ account system is met with fear and outrage. I don&#x27;t think upper management expected this or understands why the community reacted thus, just as they didn&#x27;t expect or understand why requiring a Firstname Lastname format on the Internet was problematic.<p>I don&#x27;t believe Google+ management is malicious, but they do seem woefully unaware of how internet-native communities behave.",1384670149

If an online community already has recognized favorite content creators, that also makes it extremely hard for new people to come in and get recognized for their own content. Basically, a community based in anonymity can override the whole &quot;argument from authority&quot; fallacy, because no one has any authority. Anonymity is an equalizer.

Then a proceeded to also unlink my G+ account from the app by clearing G+ App data, still no effect, instead of quickly appearing the share view from G+ it was first asking me which gmail account to use to then start G+. The only way I was able to revert it back was disabling Google+&#x27;s App, which then causes some things to not work properly such as Google Search.",1384668414

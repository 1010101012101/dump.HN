I have friends, I have a best friend, I have acquaintances (both business and social), and I have people I don't like, I may have some enemies, too.<p>But in the realm of Facebook, all these people are my friends, and I have no way to differentiate that within the Facebook platform. I do not believe it is the UI that is the problem, but the underlying architecture of it's ""social functionality"".",1278763176

Someone else reading the same books might have no result at all.<p>And, I suspect (but can't prove) that some of this is related to age as well; I can't say I know of anyone whose outlook has been radically altered by a book they read past the age of 30.<p>Now, that doesn't mean that I haven't had my life improved in small but significant way by books I've read in the past couple decades-- but the effects are nowhere as significant as those texts from my teenage years, and early 20s.",1278761977

The cutting edge of cloud has shifted from an ""if"" to a how, and the minds who saw the cloud coming years before the general public are now confronting the balancing act between intrinsically lower featured, topologically insensitive cloud formations represented by certain volume leading de facto standards--and the increasingly technically possible emergence of more topologically calibrated and therefore feature rich clouds. Because simple infrastructure clouds came first, they have largely defined the market--but the voices of ""no thanks!"" are too powerful and persistent to write off purely as technological laggards--there are important architectural reasons they have abandoned or stayed home so far.",1278761451

Second: 'what are some good philosophy books?'<p>The fact is, ""eye-opening reads"" really depends on the eye, and without much context, it's very difficult to give recommendations.<p>So I'll name two books that were 'eye-opening' for me AND are good philosophy and another that is just 'good philosophy.'<p>J. S. Mill's On Liberty. Read it. It's short. It's poignant. Don't not read this book.<p>Beyond Good and Evil by Nietzsche is required reading. if you like it, check out the viking collection of works by him and read his wikipedia page. You'll get a sense of what else  you'd like to read from these two sources.<p>The groundwork for a metaphysics of morals by Kant is a great introduction to his way of thinking/reasoning and deals with an important matter--the possibility of a moral system. This book is a good introduction to a way of philosophizing very different from the others--Kant aims to be deeply systematic and specific. While not eye-opening, 'sexy philosophy' or quite 'enjoyable,' GMM is a relatively short read and a worthwhile thought-journey.",1278760974

If you were ready to be reading them, you wouldn't be asking the question here.<p>The two books you mention in the question (Common Sense and ""On the Fourfold Root"") are both quite readable, as are a few of the primary texts mentioned in the responses (""Existentialism is a Humanism"", ""Thus Spoke Zarathustra"") but in general, I'd have to suggest you stay away from primary texts at first.<p>In other words, begin by reading works <i>about</i> philosophy, rather than works <i>of</i> philosophy.<p>A single-volume work on the history of philosophy will give you the broad scope (for example, Durant, or Russell, or ""Sophie's World"" if you prefer fiction), but will tend to turn the philosophers discussed into caricatures of themselves.<p>You mention that you are in school; I'd suggest you take a philosophy course or two, if you are interested in the field.

If the court follows that evaluation, the defendant can be put in a forensic psychiatry without being judged guilty for the crime at all.<p>Just a different point, doesn't have to do something with the abuse potential of plea bargains. The biggest criticism I have regarding plea bargains in Germany is, that they usually apply for white collar crimes since these tend to be rather to complex for the average judge and state attorney to follow. Blue collar crimes are differrent matter all together.<p>The result is that a plea bargain benefits the state since the process is fast, the defendant since not the whole scope becomes public and the sentence tends to be rather short. While there are some public prosecution departments speciallized in white collar and financial crimes they are far between. So whenever there is one that can be settled out of court, it's tempting.<p>But that's just my personal view of it. One prominent example of a guy being in a psychiatry since 2006 is Gustl Mollath.

It was quite interesting because they were doing a lot of things by hand that could simply be achieved with a little scripting (in this case, Python and Perl). Things like daily sales numbers were still added up in some obscure Excel spreadsheet (this is the biggest restaurant franchise operator in the Caribbean). The potential to innovate inside the company was huge. But no, their mainframe <i>guy</i> made it clear that the job was to continue on with his legacy of writing obscure <i>job-securing</i> (as he put it) code. I declined all the offers they made, and they are still looking for someone to fill in the position (and will be for a long time). It was sad to experience such situation.

The distinction Americans (myself as one of them) seem to have lost is the one between ""rehabilitation"" and ""revenge.""<p>We call prisons ""correctional facilities"" because at one point in time their purpose was to correct the behavior of offenders so that they could be reintegrated into society.  Today they would be better termed ""revenge facilities"", because 1) nobody who enters a run-of-the mill American prison for any appreciable length of time is going to leave a productive member of society, and 2) as the Swartz case aptly demonstrates, there's no longer a sense of just and fair punishment, only maximum, nuclear, life-crushing revenge.

I know the work on it started back in '09 and there were some v6-related bugfixes referenced in the release notes.<p>WRT 100.64.x.x. - back in '07 we pitched IANA an idea to have a dedicated class A network for VPN service providers. This was based on the assumption that while many people might use VPN networking, very few would be on two VPNs at the same time (which is neither too practical nor advisable). So having this space would've meant not needing to compete and resolve conflicts with 1918 addressing <i>and</i> it would also provide single direct-routed space within a VPN that natively supported OS broadcast traffic. Latter is a very big deal in Windows world, because of how a large chunk of Windows Networking works, and it's generally a useful thing to have for proper LAN emulation. IANA just waved us off.<p>(edit) Followed a link at the post you linked to and there's an official news release that says -<p><pre><code>  Weve added IPv6 support to Hamachi a while back, and you can \n  simply turn off the use of the 5/8 space, but we realize that \n  IPv4 is still very important to most of you.\n</code></pre>\nIt sounds like the IPv6 support is there, but the client defaults to IPv4 addressing. This has probably to do with user-facing issues of using IPv6 (like customizing passthru rules in firewalling software and such) rather than with an inherent inability of Hamachi to run outside of v4 space. It is capable of pure tap tunneling after all.",1358249163

Absolutely right. The bureaucracy is like middle management gone berserk. The founders were onto something, they built something with incredible revenue potential, and were both the executives AND the workers. Then some middle management layers had to arise for coordination. Over time the separation between the executives and the workers grew to become a yawning gulf, and the middle managers captured the asylum.<p>Lacking any inherent ability to create value (like actual producers) nor any ability to be bold and take risks (like good executives), the legal bureaucracy/middle management just consumes more and more resources.<p>It can go on for quite sometime when you have a company producing as much revenue as USG. But in this case it won't go on forever, as China is now rising beyond USG.<p><pre><code>  Look at the statist lawyer pack currently continuously \n  stating that this is just business as usual in this case.\n</code></pre>\nYeah, this seemed weird to me too. The best way to understand it is that they were taught in law school that extralegal methods (whether Lincoln suspending habeas corpus or 60s sit-ins) are allowed if and <i>only if</i> they are in service of fighting racism, sexism, homophobia, or something similarly Nazi/KKK-ish. And for those who are not straight white males, which is the majority of today's new lawyers, they also believe (and are repeatedly told) that they owe their current positions/status to the federal government's past extralegal activities.<p>So they combine hatred for pre-1960s America with reverence for the 60s revolution and absolute fealty to the modern US federal government. Insofar as they ever critique it, it is almost always to strengthen it (more taxes, more laws, more regulations, more government). They used to push to weaken criminal penalties for actual criminals (Miranda) and to defund defense, but here too there's been kind of a recent change; the new breed of Sotomayor/Holder/Bloomberg/Obama types (along with the lawyers here) are actually pretty hardcore on both of those points. They are all about mandatory maximums and drone strikes.<p>The result is something similar to the first class of students raised after the 1917 revolution. Extralegal methods for the Great October Revolution were completely justified. But after that point complete obedience to the state was required; the only exception were extralegal methods that tended to <i>increase</i> the power of the state and be directed against various libertarians, reactionaries, dissidents, or running dogs. When they felt they were still fighting against Russian culture, they pushed to reduce penalties against criminals; but once they felt they were fully in command the harshness of everything ramped way up beyond where it was pre-Revolution.",1358248279

In my opinion there are several possible reasons:\n- the &#x27;semantic&#x27; idea of &#x27;strong&#x27; modeling of the world lost out to a competing approach that uses probabilistic models. The latter models don&#x27;t require coordinated effort by humans and thus scale better. \n- the semantic approach also suffered from academicians myopically going over the same millimeters of theory for decades. And losing sight of matters of practicality.\n- The fundamentals of the semantic technology seem rather brittle to me. With that I mean that a tiny difference in the reasoning axioms can make the whole reasoning intractable. That might be anti-tethical to the &#x27;tinkering until it works&#x27; approach that software engineers often use.\n- Somehow a broady applicable killer application didn&#x27;t turn up. But that&#x27;s a result as much as it might be a reason.<p>There&#x27;s still use for the technology though. \nIf you need to unify data that follows subtly different datamodels I&#x27;d be hard pressed to think of an alternative. Which makes me wonder whether intelligence agencies use the technology. F.i. I remember a reference given by Oracle of the US Geospatial Intelligence Agency using their quad store.\nThe new moniker &#x27;linked data&#x27; emphasises this aspect. \nGovernment agencies do struggle with having to relate data that are obviously related but conceptually, legally subtly different. And they do spend quite some attention on linked data. They seem to stay mostly within the RDFS realm and do not stray into more interesting OWL applications.\nBut even in government circles I get a whiff of the solution-looking-for-a-problem vibe that hounded the semantic web for so long.",1414327497

However, in a follow up by BI[2], this figure seems to be widely refuted by Uber drivers across a number of states.

Do it Eiffel-ish.<p>At the start of your function, check all the prerequisites, e.g:<p><pre><code>   if(x<0) throw &quot;x should be non-negative. Got $x&quot;\n   if(x>=n)throw &quot;x should be smaller than n. Got $x and $n&quot;\n</code></pre>\nAdd tests for edge conditions that do not throw, but, say, increase a global counting edge conditions hit:<p><pre><code>  if(x=0) edgeConditionsHit += 1\n  if(x=n) edgeConditionsHit += 1\n</code></pre>\nThen, write tests so that you hit all paths in the condition tests.<p>If that doesn&#x27;t hit 100% in the rest of the function, the function has code it doesn&#x27;t need, or your precondition checks aren&#x27;t complete.<p>Think about other edge conditions.

And yes, that is implementation-specific, but there is nothing you can do about that.<p>Of course, you don&#x27;t need the edge condition and implementation-specific checks in release builds.<p>With these in hand, you can also split tests into implementation-specific ones and contract-based ones.",1414327333

This helps our end users because it removes a lot of guess work. What was obvious for us as maintainers is not obvious at all for the biologists who need to do stuff with our data. e.g. <a href=""http://www.uniprot.org/changes/cofactor"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.uniprot.org/changes/cofactor</a> (going to be live soon) it&#x27;s a small change from textual descriptions of which chemicals are cofactors for enzymatic activity to using the ChEBI ontology. This allows us to better rendering (UI) and better searching. It also makes the difference clear between cofactor is any Magnesium or cofactor is only Magnesium(2+).<p>In the life sciences and pharma semweb has a decent amount of uptake. For the very simple reason that this branch deals with a lot of varied information and often mixes private and public data.\nRDF makes it cheaper for organisation to deal with this.<p>SPARQL the query language has a key feature that no other technology has in the same way.\nFederalised queries: if I am in a small lab I can&#x27;t afford to have datawarehouse of UniProt, it would cost me 20,000 euro - 30,0000 euro just to run the hardware and maintain it. As a small lab I can use beta.sparql.uniprot.org for free and still combine it with my and other public data for advanced queries. Sure uniprot has a good rest interface but it is limited in what you can do with it in ways that SPARQL never will be.<p>SPARQL is only interesting as a query language since last year. Schema.org is only interesting since last year. JSON-LD is only interesting since last year. Semweb is finally growing into its possibilities and making real what was promised 17 years ago now.<p>Of course even in the life science domain many developers don&#x27;t know what one can do with semweb tech, and semweb marketing is no where as effective as e.g. MongoDB or even Neo4J is.

If this leaves a gaping security hole open for an attacker, or lead to DoS, then you need a better approach; fail2ban functionality should be in the process handling logins for example, not a separate entity watching logfiles, which might be broken too).<p>> <i>Being able to induce a restart is a huge increase in attack surface.</i><p>Compared to what?

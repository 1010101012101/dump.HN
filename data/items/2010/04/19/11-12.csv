1276494,comment,1275371,1275683,0,0,MicahWedemeyer,,,"I haven't implemented Chargify on my site yet, but I did sign up for the beta and have looked it over. Plus, I've been running subscriptions via Amazon FPS for about 2.5 years now.<p>By far, the #1 thing I like with Chargify is the ability to modify existing subscriptions. With Amazon (and PayPal too, I believe), once a user signs up with a rate and term, it's locked in. To change the rate they'd need to go through the workflow again. So, if you say $5/mo and want to move to $10/mo, you're screwed. Good luck getting them to go through the checkout again.<p>Not that this is something you'd want to do all the time, but perhaps you've been doing something for a couple years and want to raise your prices a little. Or, you want to add another tier of service and automatically bump some customers into it. It's easy with Chargify, and very hard with the others.<p>There's other stuff too, but it's hard to articulate. Believe me, having been there, I would highly suggest that anyone seriously evaluate Chargify over PayPal or Amazon SimplePay. Definitely DO NOT roll your own, like I chose to originally. It will be an unending source of pain.",1271677232

1276490,comment,1276272,1276480,0,0,jkaljundi,,,"Quite often 50% of the team members is design/development, another half is marketing/biz dev. For Garage48 we had people who were doing a huge amount of stuff in those non technical areas: making real business partnerships with restaurants/bars/cafe's, handing out flyers on the streets, actually ordering manufactured soft pet toys, making deals with other non-profits or organisations, hiring external team members or roles, making sales etc.<p>All of this during a weekend, where they basically had to use all of their contacts and networks to get external people into work mode - and succeeded in that. So in addition to more technical software hackathons, events like Garage48 give also a lot of experience in other areas. It's correct to not call them startups, but startup seeds (startup idea is not correct either, as the events are more about execution than pure talk). May be some of those seeds will blossom or mutate into new lifeforms.",1271676856

1276486,comment,1276262,1276463,0,0,mmelin,,,"Exactly. The problem with location-based advertising etc. has always been that you need users to willingly give up their location. The genius behind Foursquare (and the other services like it) is that giving up your location is the whole point of the ""game"" - it's not a step required before you can get value from the service, it's the core action that the service rewards you for.<p>And really, this is the not-so-secret behind most privacy-threatening trends and technologies: most people will gladly give up their privacy for a [ sense of safety, comment from a friend, virtual badge ].<p>And if that is the value that most of the world places on their privacy, maybe there's nothing wrong with losing it.",1271676461

I don't have any objections to what <i>happens</i> at these sorts of events (no doubt it's a good experience for those involved), but there's some general annoyance at them being labeled ""startups"" because it misrepresents the actual challenges of starting a startup, which are wholly different than what you'd encounter in such a brief timeframe.

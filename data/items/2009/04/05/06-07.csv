And if you want to install something straight from source on OS X it is often no more difficult as it is on linux. My servers are all debian and ubuntu and it's basically painless using them side by side with OS X all day. Plus, with OS X you can have most linux desktop apps + any OS X apps. Even so, OS X is definitely not necessary if someone spends all of his or her time in the shell, and if that's the case linux would be a better choice.",1238912869

There are many people for whom creationism is a fact.  Is it okay for them to teach it to their children?  If not, why is it okay for you to teach your children about evolution?<p>The fact that evolution is correct is sort of immaterial.  There is no knowledge in the absence of cognition.  For something to be known, it must be known by someone.  We know that evolution is correct, but the creationist ""knows"" that creationism is correct.",1238912593

Any good developer will need to customize their environment alot to be as productive as possible, and this means different things for different developers. Personally I choose linux because I like the development tools available there best and find it easiest to make any changes I need. That said though, OSX and Windows are perfectly legitimate choices for different people. From what I've seen though, OSX is no more low maintenance for your average developer's ""requirements"" than anything else.\nFor web development though I'd say osx or linux. I just havent seen sort of tools on windows to justify putting up with it unless you're focused on microsoft technologies (or a hopelessly entrenched windows user).",1238912132

It was fun to contrast the two.<p>It was interesting how the founders were disenchanted with the idea of having to peddle their solutions to merchants and not scientists.  I wonder if we can devise a better system for scientific and academic pursuits.

Every piece of software needs to be updated manually, as there is no system-wide update manager.  If you want to install UNIX software (like C libraries that your language needs to bind to), you will need to install some sort of ports system, and maintain that.  (When I used a Mac a few years ago, none of the ports systems all had the latest versions of packages I needed, so I had more than one installed.  This was a fucking nightmare to maintain.)<p>Anyway, this (along with Apple's evil-ness) is what killed OS X for me.  Yeah, it's really pretty, but it is too hard to maintain.

I have no data to back up my prejudice, but between the stereotype of overbearing New England parents and the probable variance in school qualities in an urban area it's not surprising.<p>In the midwest where I grew up and in Seattle where I live now it's not particularly common to stress over where your children go to school; you optimize if convenient, but most of the choices are pretty good. Likewise, my perception about life in Houston was that some of the schools were pretty bad but given the low cost of living anyone who cared either already lived in the suburbs or made so much money that they could easily afford to send their kids to another school.",1238911431

9165392,comment,9165209,9165209,0,0,gus_massa,,,"The article has almost no technical details. The idea of harvesting heat is not impossible, but I think it&#x27;s not practical. Does anyone have a back of the envelope calculation? Let&#x27;s try:<p>The problem with heat is that you can&#x27;t transform it completely to electricity. By the Second law of thermodynamics ( <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_law_of_thermodynamics"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_law_of_thermodynamics</a> \n), the maximal transformation ratio is  (Tmax-Tenv) / Tmax, where Tenv is the environment temperature and Tmax is the maximal temperature. And this is an upper bound, real cases are even smaller.<p>So, if you want to transform a lot of heat to electricity, you&#x27;d better have a very hot spot. That&#x27;s why the concentrated solar power plants concentrate the light in a small place to get a high temperature. The same idea applies to other form of work, so this is the same reason the car engine is hot (and it&#x27;s hotter inside the cylinders).<p>Back to the tires, I don&#x27;t know the temperature of a tire, but I never heard of someone getting burned by touching a car tire. I&#x27;d guess that the maximal temperature is 50°C(122°F) and let&#x27;s assume a cool day environment temperature of 10°C (50°F). The efficiency calculation must be done in the Kelvin scale, so the hot temperature is 323K and the cold temperature is 283K, do the maximal possible efficiency is (323K-283K)/323K ~=13%.<p>So, at most the 13% of the heat of the tires can be transformed to electricity, but not all the energy of the fuel goes to heat the tires. At high speed most of the energy goes to moving the air, some energy goes to the air conditioner system, some is dissipated in the radiator and with the exhaust fumes, ... So the maximal theoretical efficiency is 13% of a small part of the fuel energy, probably less than 1% overall.",1425818302
9165391,comment,9164881,9164881,0,0,sago,,,"I think the problem is fundamentally that two separate concerns are entangled: education, and certification.<p>The certification is what you need. But to get it, the university can require you to purchase a whole bunch of very expensive education you may not need.<p>Only by separating the two will this problem be solved: having certification authorities that are independent of educational providers.<p>In that utopia, even a regular university can&#x27;t grant you the certification. They can market themselves as the best and most cost effective way for you to reach the competency needed to achieve your certificate. But, perhaps MOOCs are better, or intensive library study, or perhaps you&#x27;re already that competent, and don&#x27;t need any education to get there.<p>It is only that which can solve the scandal of indebting vast swathes of young people by tens of thousands of dollars.<p>So I&#x27;m suspicious of this article, because the solutions described still make the same mistakes.

US defamation law is much less friendly to plaintiffs compared to most European countries, especially the UK (for example).  This may surprise you, but in the US, it is not enough for the plaintiff to prove that a defamatory statement is false.  You have to also prove that the defendant knew the statement to be false, or you have to prove negligence by &quot;clear and convincing evidence&quot;.  This is for private plaintiffs, the standard for &quot;public figures&quot; is higher.<p>I can recognize the attitude that &quot;if you can&#x27;t prove it in court, then shut up&quot;, but there are always going to be a few really important things that you want to say that can&#x27;t be proven in court.

But different websites require different HTML/CSS architectures, because they offer different design problems! It&#x27;s not the same to create a corporate website than an application website (just to name two different problems).<p>I&#x27;ll use the layout as an example:<p>There are different ways to define the layout of a website (call it grid if you want). If I want to create a secondary column, there&#x27;s the &quot;explicit&quot; way, where I specify that my div will take 1/3rds of the main layout with a &quot;.col-md-4&quot; class (like <a href=""http://getbootstrap.com/css/#grid"" rel=""nofollow"">http://getbootstrap.com/css/#grid</a> does).

Author/publisher contracts have the same effect on publishing industry innovation that patent trolls have on the tech sector -- only much worse and, weirdly, <i>much better</i>. Worse, because just about every published author out there is licensing their IP with strings attached, rather than doing work-for-hire: this makes it hard to develop new sales channels or explore new pricing structures. Better, because this ensures that <i>the folks who produce the content get paid</i>, as opposed to being milked like cows.<p>If I was going to disrupt publishing, I&#x27;d start by hiring lawyers, pointing them at the existing shitpile of contract boilerplate the industry runs on, and telling them, &quot;redesign this mess, it&#x27;s not fit for purpose&quot;. And you should use that as an acid test whenever you stumble across one of these bien-pensant &quot;publishing is ripe for disruption&quot; think-pieces. If they don&#x27;t realize the IP contracts underpinning publishing -- and the sales accounting and royalty systems that implement the contracts in code -- are at the root of the industry&#x27;s inertia, they don&#x27;t know nuthin&#x27;.",1425817506

ReiserFS is still a good filesystem and is still included in the Linux kernel, despite it&#x27;s author being a convicted murderer.<p>But journalism is different: the activity is subjective and we are required to trust that the journalist (and their editor and publisher etc) isn&#x27;t out to mislead us (or, more realistically, that we understand their biases and can compensate for them). Thus, the output is much closer linked to the work that went into it. The journalist was in the room, we weren&#x27;t.

Of course, the rules don&#x27;t explicitly state the directory must be otherwise empty...<p>Frankly, I think it&#x27;s pretty reasonable that Patrick &quot;lost&quot; the bet, even if Mike reasoning wasn&#x27;t sound. For Patrick to have won that bet would have required quite a list of requirements of how those &quot;other&quot; files were to be passed to the decompressor.  Such requirements were not presented, and if they had been they would have been obviously fishy.",1425816023

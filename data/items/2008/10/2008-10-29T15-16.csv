There's also a longstanding norm against leaving food on your plate which can make people feel uncomfortable about not finishing.<p>The emphasis calorie counts put on ordering a meal which you can feel comfortable about eating in its entirety are also encouraging restaurants to switch to smaller plates, which helps change our perception of what a ""normal sized meal"" is.

However, I agree with some other people here, there has got to be some sort of licensing issue.  As much as the whole ""you clicked okay to the TOS, you gave us permission."" is a tank in court, it still seems to risky.  If nothing else, it would risk users no longer using the games from the providers using that service if they found out that their computer slowed down at all during playing that game because it was doing things it wasn't supposed to.  Not that I would likely have a problem with it, but lets face it...the general public is slap happy with lawsuits.<p>Also privacy issues in the entire concept.

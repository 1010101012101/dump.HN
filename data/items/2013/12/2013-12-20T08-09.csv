They may ignore beggars on the street and may not give up their seats.  Taking it from there to an extreme (that they are immune to any fear of death) is an ugly reaction.<p>During the 3/11 earthquake, I was shocked and appalled by the stupidity of one of my co-workers who went on coding as normal while the building shook. (It was experienced as a Shindo 6 earthquake in Yokohama, so it was quite strong - I never ever experienced anything like it in my life).  He probably saw it as macho, but it was dangerous - other people then were confused as what to do. He eventually left the company for not being very competent.  (Good riddance.)<p>For every person like him, there were 50-100 people on the staff who were shocked, shaking, crying or scared. I find they reacted pretty much as I&#x27;d expect people in any school in Canada would have reacted.  It certainly was more-or-less how we reacted when one of our class fellows put an end to his life.<p>I find it distasteful that people fetishise another group of people (especially people with the same capitalist democratic strain of lifestyle) to the extent that they basically superhuman or inhuman.",1387529600

6940561,comment,6936321,6940421,1,0,Gigablah,,,"On the surface most of the popular PHP frameworks are not much different from each other. Basic MVC separation, some sort of dependency injection container (actually a service locator), Composer and standardized autoloading, etc. Once you dig into the coding aesthetics then the differences start to become clear. Yii isn&#x27;t PSR compliant, both FuelPHP and Laravel make liberal use of Facades and/or __callStatic to preserve the style of static function calls that are prevalent in CodeIgniter. I guess what makes Laravel stand out is the sheer amount of documentation and examples that are available, both on the website and in the code itself. This makes it really easy to get started.<p>Me, I&#x27;m not really keen on the Component::function() syntax. Feels like a crutch to me. Especially when people go out of their way to avoid specifying namespaces by abusing class_alias.

I don&#x27;t: I&#x27;m selfish in many other ways; pure selflessness can be just as bad (as you&#x27;ve very well described -- parents snubbing children because of a different sexual orientation!). To put in other terms, selflessness and adherence to principle are virtues in the same that bravery is a virtue; yet we don&#x27;t aplaud the bravery (or selfless, or adherence to principle, etc...) of a suicide bomber much for the same reason -- the immense suffering the rest of their action caused to others. We would, however, aplaud this in (to use a hypothetical example) a fighter pilot defending his country from a nuclear strike by ramming the incoming bomber with his aircraft after they&#x27;ve ran out of missiles or cannon shells.<p>I&#x27;ll also point out that my native language is Russian, where there isn&#x27;t a word like selfishness: there&#x27;s egoism and egotism, but not really a world like &quot;selfish&quot;. If you lookup &quot;selfish&quot; in the dictionary, you&#x27;ll find a more value-free translation of the word.<p>My poor chances of physical survival would also not be due to compromising my values: it would be due to inability to adopt to surrounding society&#x27;s values. Military service in former USSR, for example, is very different from Singapore -- bullying of nerdy/weaker/etc... enlisted men by officers is an endemic problem and has driven many recruits to suicide (lookup &quot;Dedovschina&quot;). The smart way some people took is by committing themselves to officer corps (for a much longer term) and (to fit in) becoming bullies themselves -- something I&#x27;d never be able to do.",1387527454

Westerners moving to Singapore aren&#x27;t escaping grinding poverty.<p>3) There&#x27;s a large Indian community in Singapore (indeed the very name of the country is in an Indian language) and if you&#x27;re going to compare Indians moving to the US to another group moving to Singapore (well, perhaps not moving -- they&#x27;ve been there for a long time), this is probably the right comparison to make. I don&#x27;t see a problem with multi-ethnic states, as long as everyone lives by the same basic laws. I&#x27;d still think I would find it acceptable even if the cultures were completely isolated from rest of the country, e.g., Amish in the US, as long as -- again -- they lived by the same laws.<p>4) I did state elsewhere that I think in terms of immigration policies, Singapore may be &quot;superior&quot; to the US.

Your notions of empiricism/testability as well as the scientific process strike me as a bit naive.<p>For example, you seem to have some concept of &quot;testing&quot; that involves the observer having to cause the observed phenomenon in order for it to be empirical. On that basis you might have to classify the existence of the sun as a mere hypothesis without empirical backing, though.<p>Also, you should be aware that a lot of cosmological knowledge very much comes from the here-and-now, in that the light we capture with our telescopes is actually here right now - otherwise, we could not capture it with our telescopes. If you think we should discard those observations because the light we captured has been traveling for a while, you probably also would have to consider it a mere hypothesis that your computer screen showed this text one nanosecond ago.<p>Cosmology does not somehow mysteriously extrapolate the temperature of the microwave background - it&#x27;s something you can measure, and which has been measured, a lot.<p>Of course, there are some assumptions - in the case of cosmology, the probably most important one would be the cosmological principle (&quot;the laws of physics are the same everywhere&quot;). But note that any cosmologist will tell you that that is an assumption, not something that is necessarily true.<p>Also, you may want to consider that looking back billions of years is what allows us to derive laws of nature which would be a lot harder to figure out by only observing recent events, which then can be used to understand things that are of more immediate concern to us here and now.<p>For example, the principle of evolution by natural selection was derived from observations of the past and its effects (that is, the biological landscape on the planet), and now is useful in order to explain an predict the development of antibiotics resistance.",1387526644

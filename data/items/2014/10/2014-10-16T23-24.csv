They have a no-questions asked 16 days to return it or a bit longer than that, but I don&#x27;t think they&#x27;d question a return on a already broken one.

8468624,comment,8466731,8467706,0,0,nkurz,,,"This doesn&#x27;t negate what you are saying, but I happened to be helping a friend yesterday optimize her already optimized R routine by writing a C++ extension.   In this case, a straightforward translation gave us about a 10x speedup, due much less memory shuffling.  Switching to intersecting 2KB bitmaps with AVX2 intrinsics instead of non-vectorizable IntegerArrays (average length about 20 ints) gave another ~10x speedup.   Profiling with &#x27;perf&#x27;, staring at the generated assembly, and choosing very specific syntax that g++ didn&#x27;t mangle gave another ~2x (although Intel&#x27;s icpc is still about 20% faster, and I haven&#x27;t yet been able to trick g++ into generating the comparable).<p>Was this worth it?  In this case, I think so.  It me took a day and half, and brings her per model runtime down from about 3 minutes to 1.5 seconds.   The project requires running about 30,000 models, so the improvement will reduce her total CPU time down from about 2 months to about 12 hours.   The AVX2 requirement means she can no longer run it on the usual cluster, but the speedup is enough that she do multiple runs per day on a standard Haswell desktop.<p>This is to say, while there are great things about prototyping with R, and multithreading can&#x27;t hurt, raw speed and efficiency may still be issues for some users.",1413503842

Bootcamps that send their students out into the world without a realistic idea of where they stand and how to progress beyond their current knowledge are doing an injustice to their students, and to the people who have to sift through their resumes. Its something we try very hard to to work against, and set realistic expectations for with our active students. Its partly why we built our own curriculums.<p>I think your taking the context of small apples and putting them in the context of MASSIVE apples. But I like apples, so lets not get them tied into this mess.<p>I&#x27;m still very confused what you&#x27;re arguing, as you present problems with the bootcamp model, but then what is the solution? How did you learn to code, and how was it better? How long were you restricted to education-only projects before &quot;being allowed&quot; to work on real things?<p>Hiring managers and advanced software developers lead teams for a reason, to filter out people they cannot trust from their team. I would also say though that something we do is take passionate people and give them the tools to kickstart a new career. Yes it takes time, and experience and lots of learning beyond a 3 month course, I think everyone can be realistic about that, but to say someone &quot;shouldn&#x27;t be coding anything&quot; because that&#x27;s where they started? Can&#x27;t agree there.<p>So again, how did you learn to code, and how was it better? How can the bootcamp model be adjusted to do a better job?",1413502667

It&#x27;s a common tactic for companies when the dominant supplier has a 90% market share.<p>Remember &quot;Best viewed with Netscape Navigator&quot;? Netscape wanted to control the web by defining and unilaterally introducing web standards, so Microsoft naturally allied itself with the W3C.<p>It was short lived because Microsoft effectively abandoned browser development following anti-trust action, because it decided it could/would only ship browsers with operating systems. This turned out to be a bad choice because of the long delay between XP (which included IE6) and Vista. The slow take-up of Vista made it even worse. Microsoft didn&#x27;t want people to use IE6 or XP, but the market decided otherwise.<p>All this goes back to the consent decree that Microsoft signed with Janet Reno. This specified that Microsoft was allowed to improve the operating system by adding new features. This more or less required it to build IE into the OS.<p>Microsoft was already under investigation during this period, and for the decade after the case, Microsoft operated under the close supervision of a US Judge. Whether or not you think its actions were scummy, it&#x27;s unlikely they were illegal. Indeed, during this time, Microsoft was certainly easier for third parties to deal with than Netscape -- see High Stakes for examples.<p>As for political donations, this was also inevitable. Netscape couldn&#x27;t compete in either technology or marketing so it played politics instead. Microsoft had operated on the basis that it wouldn&#x27;t get involved with politics, and then it got screwed for its neglect. It simply decided not to make that mistake again. As anyone would.<p>Either way, Netscape was doomed in the long run. It was deluded in thinking that people would pay for a client access program. (You&#x27;re welcome to provide examples of companies that have made pots of money out of this, but usually the client is free and people pay for the service.)<p>Netscape was even further deluded when it thought that it could charge PC manufacturers to ship its browser. The reality is that companies have to pay PC OEMs for distribution.<p>The final delusion was that users would pay a price for Netscape Communicator <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netscape_Communicator"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netscape_Communicator</a> in order to get their hands on Netscape Navigator.<p>You really don&#x27;t need any conspiracy theories to understand why Netscape lost.

No real previous experience with code. We want to get people excited about technology, excited about learning to code. Part of that is making easy to grasp, making it easy to problem solve. Teaching people in ways that keeps them energized and self-sufficient to make quick progress, and see that progress happening. We want people to grow and study, to explore their interests in code and perpetuate their own learning. I don&#x27;t see how what he recommends in the video goes against any of those principles as they are starting points to becoming a developer. Ways of investigating new code, ways to problem solve when you&#x27;re stuck.

For example if someone writes a new song or book, we could have a short &quot;free&quot; copyright period. After that, creator (<i>or more accurately, the rights holder</i>) would need to pay an annual fee to maintain their copyright. The fee would increase by some percentage each year.<p>If the value of the work is greater than the fee, then it&#x27;d be in the interests of the rights holder to pay the fee and maintain the copyright, for example to be able to license it out to others. If it&#x27;s not, then the copyright would expire and the work would enter the public domain.<p>A high enough interest rate for the compounding would ensure that everything is eventually in the public domain. For works that are repeatedly extended, say Mickey Mouse, the public will receive the fees collected for each of the extensions until it enters the public domain.<p>This also has the interesting effect of incentivizing the creation of <i>new</i> works as there wouldn&#x27;t be any fees associated with them for the initial term.<p>There&#x27;s obviously a lot more details to handle such as having a central registry, inflation adjustments, differentiating between new works and derived works, and how to handle works created prior to the introduction of a system like this.

The biggest limitation of display bandwidth is currently external HDMI/DP standards which are slowly ratified and adopted. For all-in-ones and laptops additional channels can be added and/or clocked higher for additional bandwidth. Apple&#x27;s TCON is probably a fairly standard part souped up a bit for higher performance to handle the additional channels / clock speeds.

Mr Snowden presently lives in Moscow, where he claimed asylum after the American government cancelled his passport while he was travelling to South America. The film finishes with a visit from Mr Greenwald, with he and Mr Snowden discussing the existence of a second leaker inside the NSA—something that has been rumoured for months in the press and on computer-security blogs. When Mr Greenwald shows Mr Snowden what his new source is offering, his eyebrows almost climb off the top of his head. Like an action film setting up a plot hook for a sequel, viewers are told in no uncertain terms to expect more leaks—and soon.",1413500969

Given that there were only two uncolonized countries, the sample size there is too small to be meaningful, though the fact that neither Liberia nor Ethiopia fall into the lowest group of African countries in terms of either HDI, and there are a number of countries below both in Africa that did fall under colonial rule (Central African Republic, DR Congo, Malawi, Burindi below Liberia, plus Niger, Mozambique, Eritria, Guinea, Togo, Madagascar, and Guinea-Bissau below Ethiopia), would seem to indicate that colonial areas can be quite bad off.<p>Lets also look at your example of Hong Kong. The issue there is that you&#x27;re conflating a single city, one that was used as primarily a trading and financial hub for the British Empire, with an entire country. Cities across the world tend to be more prosperous in general than the rest of the country.

The constitution is supposed to be the set of meta-rules which dictate how and what the government can do. Like it or not this turns out to come down to literary interpretation. There are two major schools of thought about how one should interpret literature, and I prefer the one that suggests the context in which something was written should be taken into consideration (the other school, which happens to dominate departments of English Literature, is kind of nutty).<p>You may think that constitutional democracy is a Bad Idea, in which case feel free to argue that point. But within that framework, we live by rules, and what those rules <i>mean</i> -- or more importantly, what people <i>think</i> they mean -- matters.<p>This kind of thinking is unappealing to programmers and engineers -- it&#x27;s a concept generally known as &quot;social construction&quot;. Our government is a social construct. So is money. So is bitcoin. So are mathematical proofs (!) -- at bottom, a mathematical proof is an argument that convinces mathematicians. If you don&#x27;t want the FBI to shoot you, you might want to consider that having a shared understanding of the laws they believe they are enforcing is a Good Idea.<p>Second, it&#x27;s interesting to realize that most of the stupid stuff happening today was anticipated, and the fine points argued over, by a group of smart guys over two hundred years ago. It&#x27;s sad that the level of debate today comes down to arguing over what these guys meant by something, especially when most of those doing the arguing lack basic comprehension skills.",1413500851

When you use Tor, you&#x27;re accepting the risk that the exit node could be sniffing and/or manipulating your traffic as a tradeoff in order to hide your IP address from the remote server and anyone in between.  For that reason, if you really need to use Tor then you need to be aware of every connection you make - everything should be over SSL with pinned or otherwise verified certificates.<p>I&#x27;d recommend against even enabling Tor globally for a single machine, unless that was a dedicated box that&#x27;s only used for anonymous browsing.

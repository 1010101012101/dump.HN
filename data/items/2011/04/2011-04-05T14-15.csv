I had thought it was either a) getting sleep at the wrong times (I'll tend to stay awake later each night) and thus missing out on sunlight, or b) that regularity itself prevented my depression. This would also explain it, though.",1302015586

A slow browser in a newsagent's shop is chased out, and puts down a potential purchase. or isn't chased out, and enjoys - but doesn't pay for - several articles. An influential reviewer, having a bad day, communicates his distaste for a work without tempering his words; at a stroke, ten thousand potential sales are 'lost', the artist is deprived ten thousand times over. Copyright on a work expires (75 years after the death of the artist) - the artist is (sort of?) deprived (or rather, his estate is, or he was, back in the day).
People are being deprived of something totally artificial which was granted to them and them unwaveringly, thanks to the Disney lobby, enhanced. Copyright reform has always gone in one direction and it remains illegal to format shift your own belongings in the UK. The debate in a nutshell includes people who'd like to see things swing back in the other direction, without necessarily eradicating copyright, simply because each extension of copyright (a state-granted monopoly right over what you can communicate and reproduce for the benefit of others) grants benefits to the rightsholders at the sacrifice of the commons, and of my rights to use my property (CD burners, CDs, books, etc) freely.",1302015155

2411022,comment,2410307,2410944,2,0,sbarre,,,"The problem I have with ""$18/month more"" is that when you are running and hosting 10 or 20 sites (like our company does) that adds up fast and cuts into the margin.<p>And I don't have ssh access.
And I can't install my own extensions.
And if I want to run cron jobs, it costs more.
And if I want to run MongoDB, it costs more.
And if I want to use Memcached, it costs more.<p>So while I get the convenience, ""doing it myself"" is super simple for PHP stacks, and the costs of using their basic non-elastic add up fast when you are hosting lots of sites, and it actually gives me less, not more.<p>When you say it isn't meant for people who want to do it themselves, I would agree on the elastic plans (running an auto-scaling setup correctly is not easy), but their basic plan really doesn't offer anything compelling for what I consider to be a relatively high price.<p>The whole scaling argument is great and if that's a real concern for your project, then services like Orchestra.io are awesome, but I think a lot of people over-provision and plan for scaling prematurely, and pay the price for it unnecessarily.<p>My sites don't have millions of users, but some of them have up to 10k registered active users and with some smart caching and setup, run just fine on the aforementioned 12$/month servers.<p>Anyways, I think I've made my point here.  I wish these guys the best and I'm happy to see people offering these kinds of services in the (admittedly un-sexy but still very popular) PHP space, and I will definitely follow their progress on the scaling offerings.",1302013246

What's he trying to say?<p><i>Todays market of representations means that we exchange images that are valued by statements without consequence, statements whose only value is the one of attention, something we have learned from the advertising process, which has become the key process of culture. This cultural praxis fails to find a history of the human faces. The faces tried to break the boundaries of word and image, they were processes of conscious creation of speaking images for the feelings that words fail to describe.</i>",1302012107

2410936,comment,2410492,2410492,7,0,kls,,,"There has been a link to depression and too much sleep so much so that sleep deprivation is used as a treatment for depression where other treatments fail. It actually puts the patient into a manic episode.<p>It was peculiar to note that people who are short-sleepers also share a slight manic trait in their personality. While the article makes short-sleep cycles out to look like all sunshine and roses it is not all it is cracked up to be. I get between 2 and 4 hours sleep a night and on a good night I get 6. I have to monitor the sleep I am getting because if I allow myself to fall into a cycle of 2 hours for an extended time I start to have problems with my heart and abnormal rhythms. If the > 4 hours cycle goes on for more than a week I have to start taking medicine to sleep to ensure that my body is receiving an adequate amount of sleep. I see no negative effects if I get 4-6 a night, but it is probably safe to assume that short-sleep cycles rides the line between good and bad health. I never considered myself a short sleeper I just figured I have insomnia but never worried too much about it because I feel no different if I get 4 or 8 hours of sleep a night (if I can get 8) and the fact that my father and grandfather shares the trait and are healthy (grandfather is almost 90) . On the plus side, I experience more life and get more done which are really the only benefits to sleeping less.",1302012054

Sure, there's a chart at the end with some data about income reported by owners of different phones. However, the meat of the author's argument is based on assumptions (presented as smug ""hints"") about which platform has more fashionistas, hardcore gamers, and people willing to pay for a productivity app. Someone else could just as easily write an article smugly hinting that the Android platform has more x, y, and z, and both articles would still be based on assumptions.",1302012023

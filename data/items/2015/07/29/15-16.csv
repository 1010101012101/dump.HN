Like literature and music, you take it into a context that it wasn’t written for, and it rarely produces a desirable response. As long as computing is relevant, we will need new software.<p>The last 100 years of computing machines have proven that this still applies.

There&#x27;s no way to go back and fix old files, but I know iTunes has done flawless gapless (when the source files are good, e.g. ripped from CD in iTunes) for about 10 years (I remember getting the firmware update on my black iPod video, ahhh now that was a beautiful looking bit of kit! Not very waterproof as it turns out though...)<p>Google Music doesn&#x27;t play gapless properly, which is incredibly annoying, and indeed I struggled to get any player on Android to play gapless as well as iTunes. Poweramp was the closest I could find. Ended up going back to iPhone for that and other reasons. Not sure how iTunes Match handles gapless as I could never get it to upload my library properly, never mind play it back...<p>I still feel there is a big gap in the market for a <i>really good</i> cloud music repository. Hopefully Spotify can get in to that space, their player is the best out of the ones I&#x27;ve tried (though still a lot of room for improvement).

The argument isn&#x27;t <i>whether they&#x27;re allowed to do it</i> (whether the first amendment applies here), but rather, should they do it?<p>I say probably not. In many cases, morals/ethics are subjective and should not be <i>enforced</i> upon others.

Discussion and debate is cool, enforcement is not.<p>And just as the company itself has the right to censor whatever it pleases, its users have the right to <i>stop using their services</i> when they feel that the company is infringing on their rights -- which is what a lot of people here are saying (they&#x27;re not saying &quot;this is bad, the company should get in trouble for it,&quot; they&#x27;re saying &quot;this is bad, I refuse to do business with a bad company&quot;).",1438183231

They are just trying to survive as a business.<p>But I don&#x27;t agree that the resultant alarmism is mind boggling.  Folks are becoming increasingly anxious at the ever increasing signalling costs being applied to innocent discourse; applied by people who have little to no institutional authority, and who certainly aren&#x27;t recognised by folk AS authorities.<p>In response - folk are responding instinctively by upping their own application of signalling costs in retaliation.  So you see folks saying things like:  I&#x27;ll never use GitHub again if they do this, instead of just remarking to themselves privately - gee, that was a bit harsh of Github, and moving along with their day.<p>What I personally find interesting is that I&#x27;m not seeing much discussion about what the real causes of these rising signalling costs are.  I kind of expected Hacker News to be interested in that sort of thing - but here, as everywhere else, everyone is just getting caught up in the fever.  We are all human I suppose.<p>My favourite explanation is one predicted by various game theoretic models about punishment in human groups.  Game theory predicts that as human group sizes increases more people become &quot;punishers&quot; and apply higher signalling costs.  I can link to research papers if people request.<p>With the internet - of course - group sizes have increased massively.  Furthermore - the economic costs of signalling have dropped dramatically.  So we are collectively applying much higher social signalling costs to compensate.<p>I haven&#x27;t been able to find research that specifically tries to confirm this hypothesis - but various related hypotheses, as well as the game theoretic models that generated them, have obtained significant confirmation.  Hence I set high credence for this particular hypothesis of mine (though it does need a much more rigorous formulation).",1438183096

However, I don&#x27;t think that was the intent in the long term. If loyalty is a problem with a service business then your customer acquisition has a flaw (high discount) or you provide no additional value to the customer (quality control, customer service, insurance, backup cleaners).Certainly the loyalty problem exists with &quot;traditional&quot; services as well. The big franchises stay in business by first providing good service and second loyal workers. Those factors plus acquiring the right kind of customer provides the recurring revenue this type of business needs to survive.",1438182358

The old adage of “Desktop apps are novels and Mobile apps are proverbs” may not hold as mobile matures, there is nuance.<p>Mobile applications are especially sensitive to this pressure of feature growth since the users are often interacting in short “mobile minute” spurts of need at a specific time and location ( of course not in all cases, youtube iPad engagement is much longer).  The juxtaposition of large apps that support the desired feature and a small app that just does the one desired feature is where larger app stakeholders are trying to hold user base by providing the best of both words by splitting up apps and creating app ecosystems “constellations”.<p>Some things that are not discussed in this article that discounts the current state of mobile apps is the new integration/federation capabilities provided by mobile platforms such as deep-linking, custom actions and widgets.<p>Another interesting situation is how a “north star” or “keystone” app may fit into this by providing the highly valued &quot;single sign on” authentication feature for an app ecosystem.  I despise login screens and passwords fields in mobile and its Im happy to install a second app so long as you federate authentication.<p>Maybe in the end one app makes a product but two make a platform ( or maybe just skip the ‘app’ all together and make an API )",1438182245

You will automatically be working on something needed in the marketplace.  3.  You will be focusing on what's needed like a laserbeam.  DO NOT TAKE THIS ADVICE LIGHTLY!  It's what my first mentor told me.  I didn't follow this advice.  Boy, am I sorry.  It is spot on.  I wasted years whistling my own tune.<p>When the project is finished, reevaluate.  You may be surprised at what you think then.

36352,comment,36276,36276,0,0,euccastro,,,"Thanks for your comments.  I was aware that the initial delay in starting up can be seen as procrastination.  I myself am not sure that's not the case, and that's the main reason why I bounce my ideas here.  Maybe my comfy self is fooling me, but can it fool the YCnews swarm? ;)  Let me add some more context, which I left out of the already long first post.<p>One crucial reason for quitting my job is indeed to focus on learning tasks I had set for myself.  It's lack of focus, not time, what has been dragging me so far.<p>The first task is to finish absorbing SICP.  I have read the book and watched the lectures before, but only as a quick first contact, skimming most of the latter parts and not doing the exercises.  I've found that even this light exposure has made me a much better programmer.  This time I'm going more exhaustively, writing down short summaries of the chapters and doing all the exercises as I find them.<p>As for math, I'm more interested in building some math muscle and intuition, rather than any specific knowledge.  I have started reading Concrete Mathematics, by Knuth et al., and I find it very demanding but practicable.  With my weak math background, this would take forever, and be too easy to put on hold, if I did it on the side of more urgent obligations.  I tried.<p>I have other books and learning tasks in the backburner, but  yes, those I can learn on the side.  The above are the ones I want to finish before letting other focus consuming projects into my head.<p>I've found that the Archy-like editor project is a good playground for the ideas in SICP.  The design is sound and well specified, so I can focus more on the programming part.  I plan to use this as my hacking environment in the future.<p>I hope to be done earlier than four months with the tasks above. I'll try and hit two months, but I must admit my estimates are often short by a factor or pi, so a 2x padding seems right for a strict timebox.<p>There are other topics to reply; I'll do so in replies to the appropriate comments.",1185289672

The variable declaration is &#x27;hoisted&#x27; to the top of the scope, which is defined as where the variable declaration is. Tautological! The rest of your example then falls out the fact local variables can shadow member variables [1].<p>C# scopes local variables more similarly to javascript&#x27;s &quot;let&quot;.<p><pre><code>    class Example {\n        public void Foo() {\n            Console.WriteLine(f); // Error: The name &#x27;f&#x27; does not exist in the current context\n        }\n        \n        public void Bar() {\n            Console.WriteLine(f); // Error: Cannot use local variable &#x27;f&#x27; before it is declared\n            String f = &quot;a&quot;;\n        }\n    }\n</code></pre>\nIn Bar, it knows about the variable f, evidenced by the fact the error message is different to Foo. In Javascript terminology, f was &#x27;hoisted&#x27; to the top of Bar. In regular terminology, f is in the lexical scope created by Bar.<p>[1] Local variables can only shadow member variables, not other local variables. The justification the specification gives for shadowing is so that superclasses can introduce protected member variables without forcing subclasses to rename their local variables. You can still reference the member variable using &quot;this.memberVariable&quot;.",1448704459

What were the results of this experiment? Somewhat surprisingly, it worked... We eventually had many competitors, on the order of twenty to thirty of them, but none of their software could compete with ours... It must have seemed to our competitors that we had some kind of secret weapon... We were just able to develop software faster than anyone thought possible.<p>Here&#x27;s a better experiment:<p>- Take two teams: one with great programmers, and one with mediocre programmers.<p>- Force them to swap toolsets.<p>Question, which team will outperform? If language is the secret, the mediocre team should outperform the talented team.<p>But that&#x27;s preposterous. Great developers write good software fast. Bad developers do otherwise. All developers work best in their favorite tools.

Eg, increase in Manhattan apartments and a decrease in mid-western farms.<p>That would cause asset prices to remain in sync with GDP as the worker would increase goods trade by producing more value in the hot spot.<p>To me, this is probably caused by two things: foreign direct investment in property from China and oil princes which increases the demand for assets and boosts prices, along with slower than inflation wage growth allowing for more investment in assets instead of labor. Foreigner investment is obvious, but for the wage issue: if a business pays less of total profit towards workers, the business has more money to spend on assets. The GDP would be pushed down and the asset price would be pushed up.<p>I&#x27;m no economist though. There might be other reasons that are more valid.",1448702026

The only thing they have in common is using parentheses - they&#x27;re about as different from each other as JavaScript and C.<p>Scheme is more functional programming oriented, Common Lisp is less so. Scheme is very minimalist, it&#x27;s most recent standard contains only about 20 syntax definitions! Unfortunately this transformed Scheme into a concept from an implementation.  Compare this to CL, which has just about everything and the kitchen sink, and is more of a &quot;concrete&quot; language.<p>To choose a Lisp is to choose an implementation. I&#x27;d recommend playing with all of them. Common Lisp, a Scheme (CHICKEN or Guile), or the &quot;recent&quot; ones like Clojure and Racket. Racket is very much a Scheme - it used to be called PLT Scheme - and has a bunch of PLT superstars  building really cool stuff with it.<p>Clojure, the JVM-based Lisp, has more in common with Common Lisp than any other, but embodies a strong philosophy about identity and value. It has a lot of common with Haskell in that regard, supporting immutable data structures and STM right out of the box. It also has really cool ideas like transients [1], transducers [2] and protocols [3], features which have since crept into other languages.<p>Clojure is probably the most popular right now, and its ecosystem is growing every day, and can be used for building serious stuff. This doesn&#x27;t mean you can&#x27;t build cool stuff with other Lisps! CHICKEN Scheme has a great package ecosystem, so does Racket, Guile lags behind, and for Common Lisp there&#x27;s a recent &quot;State of the Ecosystem&quot; article[4] that summarizes its ecosystem.<p><i>&quot;Lisp is worth learning for the profound enlightenment experience you will have when you finally get it; that experience will make you a better programmer for the rest of your days, even if you never actually use Lisp itself a lot.&quot;</i><p>-- Eric S.

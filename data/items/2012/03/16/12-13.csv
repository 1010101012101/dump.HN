My default position on these is that I don't sign up unless I believe the site will offer me some value. If you want my personal info, I must feel like I am getting something in return. Another Pinterest clone does not, IMHO, provide enough value to make me sign up, especially when I am not allowed to view the site's content until I have signed up. If I was going to clone Pinterest, I would be sure to clone their key feature - anonymous users can see all of the content.<p>""Yes sir, entry is just $10. Don't worry, we'll show you what's inside after you have paid your entrance fee, but trust us, it's great.""<p>I'm sure the site is fantastic, and what I have seen of the design is very nice.

3713073,comment,3712411,3712411,1,0,CPlatypus,,,"While bequeathing code to the community instead of having it buried with you is a <i>very</i> good thing it comes with a caveat.  In most cases, it's not a good idea to pick up the result in its entirety - all of the code, the brand, the users, etc.  That's baggage.  It's a burden, not a help.  In most cases it's better to make an explicit fork, or even just cherry-pick the best ideas and bits of code for use in a clearly separate project.  If users think the new thing is better than the old, they'll migrate.  If they don't, they won't feel entitled to come bugging you for support - or, if they do, you'll have a good reason to turn them away and concentrate on making the new thing great.  Obviously you have to comply with the original licenses if you copy code, but you'd have to do that anyway.  This way is likely to be far better for your own sanity and ultimately for users as well.",1331902395

For works of fiction, or biographies, or for other books laid out in linear fashion, there's a tangible benefit to reading linearly. (And on through to the end).<p>For reference works, or almost any type of nonfiction these days, nonlinear consumption makes a lot of sense. How many of us have read a dictionary or an encyclopedia from cover to cover? How many of us have read a collection of essays in a perfectly linear manner? Any sort of book that does not confer a specific benefit upon linear consumption offers no real incentive for such. Linearity is largely a convention to which we've grown accustomed, and I would argue that the era of software and hyperlinks -- cross-references at the click of the button -- is steadily eroding that convention.

While it's often hard to distinguish Santorum's genuine beliefs from his pandering to the redneck vote, the distinction is somewhat irrelevant. He now stands for that base, and he needs it as a bargaining chip in pretty much any outcome that can occur between now and the convention. At a brokered convention, he'll be able to cash in that voting base for a cabinet or advisory position (probably not a vice presidential slot, but at least something) on Romney's ticket. If Romney ends up beating him outright before the convention, then he'll cash it in for a lucrative talkshow deal, a la Mike Huckabee. At the very least, and certainly in any event, he'll be able to sell a mountain of books.<p>The point is, from a game-theoretical standpoint, there is no benefit to Santorum in backing down from his rhetoric at this juncture. He's in an especially lucrative position because Romney is so perfectly ill-positioned to win over the base Santorum has carved out for himself.

We flew to the US and her ESTA application from a few years back had expired. (Every 3-4 years I think, you have to renew). So at the airline check in, we're informed she'll have to re-apply. We though we were screwed but no, she just had to apply right there on the spot using my iPad and the airport's free wi-fi. Went to the ESTA site, filled out some info, paid the fee with a credit card and then proceeded to US immigration (which in Toronto, is in the airport itself).<p>How much security could that form be adding if you can apply for it literally minutes before travelling to the US.",1331899856

Success is not easy to come by. You have to keep working on going from where you are and where you want to be.<p>Extensive networking. Learning things. Acquiring new skills. And making stuff.<p>That's it. Even if you do make it to YC, there is no guarantee that you'll succeed. In fact, it's more likely that your startup will fail than not. Start a startup if you truly <i>have</i> to (just <i>want</i> to is not enough). And go start working.<p>It may seem like a paradox but your chances of getting into YC are higher if you don't need them as bad (ie you already have a product that people love). In plain english, be successful to be successful. Think it through, get a good friend along, brainstorm and make something. Figure out how you'll get past the inertia involved in making things. Talk to people. Network. Iterate.<p>To be very honest it does help if you are from MIT/Harvard. But, you can always substitute that with a strong portfolio. To re-iterate ewokhead's point: yes, you do have a chance if you create it yourself.",1331899603

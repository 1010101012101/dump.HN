10703575,comment,10695340,10703175,0,0,buro9,,,"Small, safe spaces.<p>That is... I went onto the streets to escape poverty, violence and sexual abuse.<p>For me a hostel was not a safe space, so I didn&#x27;t even successfully make it onto the first rung of support. It was hostels that distributed information on where to get food and such, so I missed that too.<p>So there needs to be a better support system for those sleeping rough, and that needs to recognise the flaws in the offerings today and also find better ways to distribute information.<p>Then, I&#x27;ve made the argument before that we should have a better way to migrate someone off of the street. It&#x27;s not enough to give a council flat, someone I knew at that time eventually committed suicide because he couldn&#x27;t cope, fell apart, and suffered from the isolation.<p>I think instead of that, there should be spaces smaller than a studio apartment that are transition spaces. They should be private, but perhaps clustered so that there is a support network there. People should be given help on how to do things, simple things like how to shop and eat better, how to take care of a home and manage the utilities and bills, how to basically live normally again and construct those routines. How to not shrink into that space and be alone.<p>I did meet a lot of people with mental illnesses, I don&#x27;t believe anyone can wave a magic wand and get them off the streets. But we can have the structure in place to help them so that when they are ready, it&#x27;s possible.<p>The vast majority of the people on the streets in the UK aren&#x27;t there because of drugs and alcohol, that&#x27;s just a visible symptom of a small minority. Most I spoke to had normal lives, good lives, but a trauma occurred and they ended up on the street. There seemed to be a lot of divorced or widowed males. A lot of the young who were physically and/or sexually abused.<p>Anyhow, a link <a href=""http://crackandcider.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://crackandcider.com/</a> . These people are good, it&#x27;s no magic wand, but they will take monetary donations and turn it into basic things to help keep people warm and alive even if they are rough-sleeping. I like that they&#x27;re challenging those misconceptions too.",1449669591

Look at these pages:<p><a href=""http://fileformats.archiveteam.org/wiki/Dendrochronology"" rel=""nofollow"">http://fileformats.archiveteam.org/wiki/Dendrochronology</a><p><a href=""http://fileformats.archiveteam.org/wiki/Quantum_computer"" rel=""nofollow"">http://fileformats.archiveteam.org/wiki/Quantum_computer</a><p><a href=""http://fileformats.archiveteam.org/wiki/TLD_.mobi"" rel=""nofollow"">http://fileformats.archiveteam.org/wiki/TLD_.mobi</a><p><a href=""http://fileformats.archiveteam.org/wiki/Endianness"" rel=""nofollow"">http://fileformats.archiveteam.org/wiki/Endianness</a><p>How is any of these things a file format? Because the definition of a file format in the FAQ (<<a href=""http://fileformats.archiveteam.org/wiki/FAQ:File_Format>"" rel=""nofollow"">http://fileformats.archiveteam.org/wiki/FAQ:File_Format></a>) is so broad that it can be made to encompass basically everything. The manifesto that started this site is a rambling sermon that doesn&#x27;t clarify anything in this respect: it just repeats &quot;let&#x27;s solve the problem&quot; without even properly defining what the problem is.<p>There are also other issues. The classification scheme is often Procrustean and confused. Error messages were until recently mixed up with error detection codes, which conflates two different meanings of &quot;error&quot;. Similarly FUSE shares a category with HFS+, even though the former is an API, and the latter a disk format; distinct things which just happen to share the name of &quot;file system&quot;. The pages are rather short and consist mostly of lists of links. Given the above-mentioned lack of clearly defined scope, I suspect many pages seem to be created about topics just because they&#x27;re in the news and/or just to have a place to put a link to a &quot;neat&quot; blog post: see for example <<a href=""http://fileformats.archiveteam.org/wiki/Facebook#Links>"" rel=""nofollow"">http://fileformats.archiveteam.org/wiki/Facebook#Links></a>.<p>Last but not least, the whole site is rather ugly, and the logo is awfully non-descriptive of what it&#x27;s supposed to contain; what am I supposed to do with this thumb, stick it up my arse?<p>It&#x27;s a shame, really, because documenting file formats is a hard and valuable endeavour.

Why deliberately shatter the intrinsic understanding of how the web page works by purposefully destroying all that knowledge and then forcing the user to construct new understanding?

Essentially Yahoo is like a mutual fund that made some good investments but the fund managers are blowing it by running a poorly performing lemonade stand on the side. A lot of the investors just want the holdings and then are happy to let the stinker, Yahoo&#x27;s original business, just go away. At the moment the market assigns the core business a negative valuation so it&#x27;s beyond a stinker, it&#x27;s an anti-company offsetting the value of investment holdings elsewhere under the corporation.

But since you can process new sensory input at the same time as disambiguating previous input, you can get the garden path effect.

I hope it won&#x27;t be too disappointing for you... there&#x27;s a whole world of experiences to explore with your daughters!<p>I&#x27;m on the older edge or in the early middle of the Millennial generation, depending who defines the generation. As such I grew up and grew into technology just as we were getting really immersive operating system UI/UX. I remember fondly the green screen, text-based, 5.25&quot; floppy games we had in elementary school, as well as the immersive film-like experiences today.<p>Chemistry sets were kinda boring, Couldn&#x27;t have cared less about my Dad&#x27;s Erector sets, much to his disappointment. I built a few model cars and a F-14 over a span of 6 months, then those lived in a box never to be heard from again.<p>And even in the computer... hacking around in the depths of my parents&#x27; computers was never the fun thing. But getting into web development was super cool, because it was raw, new, etc. Even as I look around, the companies I find exciting are more often web software vice native OS. I&#x27;m learning to appreciate embedded systems and very low level machine management, but it still doesn&#x27;t have that spark like hacking about in GeoCities did...<p>What&#x27;s the raw, new, interesting tech today? I don&#x27;t wonder if part of it is figuring out what might be the new version of playing with hobby boards or experimenting in system drivers. Even for me, getting a diode wired up to light up as a kid was super boring. But wiring up an iOS app might be super interesting now.<p>Or, maybe your girls would rather be lawyers or vets or oil rig mechanics. I hear that&#x27;s part of the fun of parenting :)",1449668140

I clearly recall IT staffing at the company where the PDP-11 came from heavily staffed by women. However, even the daughters of those women at that time who I got to meet, to the last one, had zero interest in anything having to do with computers. Except maybe for the occasional game that caught their fancy. Usually storyline-driven themes like On-Line Systems aka Sierra Entertainment titles and Pac-Man clones; they rejected all of the dungeon crawlers or shoot-up themes. I recall even as a youngster thinking at the time the displayed gender preferences very odd, as computers to me were neutral territory where neither gender had an obvious physical or social advantage at the outset.<p>I am guessing that the early marketers likely observed the same emergent social behaviors, and decided to market to where the money was.

That&#x27;s what we pay taxes for, so that people who happen to be evicted didn&#x27;t end up in the streets. There&#x27;s plenty of money on the table, and all you have to do is ask. You have to work the system, you need to know where to go and whom to talk to, and in a situation when you don&#x27;t have the money for a bus ticket, that requires much more effort than it would normally do.<p>The system in the UK can be summed up as &quot;help thyself, and the government will help thee&quot;. I think it is a good system, because it taught me to take care of myself. Its unfortunate effect is that people whose coping mechanism involves self-destructive behaviours are not being helped, even when help is available for them.",1449666289

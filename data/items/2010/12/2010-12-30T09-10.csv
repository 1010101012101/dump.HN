This may not be the case, certainly it has never been proven. Furthermore, you speak about free and open in absolute terms though of course these concepts are relative concepts and cut across many categories. Slavoj Zizek (a European philosopher) has questioned[2] this unspoken connection - as have many others. The idea now is that capitalism with Asian features (by which is meant a capitalist system that does not go hand in hand with multi-party democracy) might actually be more efficient and more voracious than Western style capitalism.<p>Given the laws passed by congress in the last 10 years you would have to be deaf and blind not to have noticed the increasing hostility[3] towards liberty and openness in the US. In no particular order you have: pervasive wiretapping, the USA PATRIOT act, humiliation at the border, the executive assassination program (of US citizens!), largest prison population in the world in percentage and absolute terms, to name but a few off the top of my head.<p>I think the US needs to do a little bit more than just rearranging deck-chairs on what ostensibly looks like a ship in danger of sinking.<p>[1] <a href=""https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/rankorder/2001rank.html?countryName=European%20Union&countryCode=ee&regionCode=eu&rank=1#ee"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://topdocumentaryfilms.com/living-end-times-slavoj-zizek/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://topdocumentaryfilms.com/living-end-times-slavoj-zizek...</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://www.historycommons.org/timeline.jsp?timeline=civilliberties&ordering=beginDate+descending&timeperiod="" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.historycommons.org/timeline.jsp?timeline=civillib...</a>",1293702607

Many of them contain two binaries -- one for PPC and one for Intel -- so that inflates the size significantly. OS X also just tends to have bigger applications, I'm not sure what all is in there; maybe larger icons or maybe OS X just requires a lot of extra big files somehow.<p>For instance, the VLC 32/64-bit package for Intel on OS X, which is the first linked download and the one users are mostly likely to click, is ~40MB whereas the Windows download is ~20MB (the OS X 32-bit only is ~24MB). The Arch Linux package is a 6MB download.<p>Stuff on OS X just takes a _lot_ more disk space. Arch Linux's package for emacs (<a href=""http://www.archlinux.org/packages/extra/i686/emacs/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.archlinux.org/packages/extra/i686/emacs/</a>) is 89.7MB installed, whereas your post indicates that on OS X emacs consumes 133MB.<p>So really the space requirements will even less for non-OS X users.",1293702444

It appears to me that the writer may have inadvertently asked his users to click on adverts, because it helps him generate profit. I don't think there's anything wrong with that, but Google does, and it explicitly says that in its Adsense contract.<p>With that being said, Mr Winter deserved a human voice at the very least. A discussion, not a computer generated decision. Perhaps the adsense account for the personal website should have been ceased, but doing so for the youtube one too, is petty. Of course (assuming) a computer can't tell the difference between these outlets a human voice would have helped in this matter.<p>After reading some of the comments, I really think pulling down the youtube videos and throwing up 30 second 'previews', with a link to the full version on Vimeo, is a great idea.

Are you saying that hiring people and turning a profit from their labor is inherently evil?  or is that only so when there is a pre-existing relationship?<p>edit: moved this from another comment of mine, as it really is a response to the ""crass and vulgar"" statement:<p>I'll be the first to admit that I'm not as refined as most people here.   You could certainly call me vulgar, in most senses of the word.  I certainly lack good breeding and taste.   I never went to college.[1]  Hell, I spent half my childhood in a mobile home park.<p>But I don't see what's wrong with offering someone a better job than they had before, even if that someone is friend or family, even if I turn a profit on the deal.<p>[1]I am both proud and ashamed that I didn't go to college.   Proud, because I am able to earn a middle-class salary without going to school, but also ashamed because to be truthful, I didn't go because I couldn't cut it.    My math is pretty abysmal, and there's no way I have the willpower to hold down a full-time job /and/ do homework, and that is something to be ashamed about.",1293700336

That type of opportunism is unhelpful, distracting and poisonous.<p>I personally believe that this topic (the responsibility of intellectuals) touches upon an issue that troubles me a huge amount. Assume that one isn't an intellectual but that you have gone out of your way to discover the truth about the world around you and how your government and other governments act. Assume that you have developed a layer of cynicism, skepticism, mistrust, and now have a healthy wariness of propaganda. If you do not act on this knowledge, how culpable are you with respect to the actions of your representatives? Do you donate to just causes that try to prevent or undo the harm done to others in your name? Do you sign petitions? Do you write your representative? Do you organize meetings to talk about these issues? Do you protest on the street? Do you write articles and books? Do you run for office? I do none of these things and I _hate_ myself for it. I feel that I have done the easy part, I have made myself informed - it is our responsibility to get informed and I have done that part. But the responsibility must go further or society won't change - we get a nation of informed but glassy eyed proles. I am that prole and it saddens me greatly.<p>† but I'd sure avoid chatting to you at a cocktail party :) haha, joke! No I'm sure you're a lovely person really.",1293700238

2051768,comment,2050797,2051723,0,0,michaelchisari,,,"<i>though it's probably the case that there will be more of them</i><p>Someone pointed out below the issue of time investment in order to be an intellectual.  The internet makes searching, information retrieval, access to experts, etc. so much less time consuming, that it becomes perfectly reasonable to work a full time job, have a family, and still slowly build a repertoire around a subject.  So that does mean more people can become intellectuals.<p>And that increase in numbers can build momentum, but what I'm suggesting is to not just bank on that as a natural occurrence, but to actively work towards a culture of public intellectualism.<p>Others down below let their skepticism get in the way, and that's exactly one of the problems I think we all need to overcome.  Of course, it's difficult, a lot of people have grown up in a culture of anti-intellectualism, of ideological stubbornness, or of passive acceptance.<p>Think of it this way, the first step in changing a culture is to no longer accept that a culture must be the way it is. It doesn't mean that everyone will suddenly become Noam Chomsky, but instead of simply accepting the goal as impossible, take it as a challenge:  How do we get from here to there?<p><i>If you want to learn physics, reading all the physics blogs on the internet is probably not as good an approach as picking up the best 20 or 30 physics books you can find and reading them cover to cover.</i><p>Sure, blogs aren't great, physics books are much better, but we now also have MIT OpenCourseWare, Connexions, etc. I can almost completely get a full MIT education, sometimes including lectures, without ever having to get accepted into MIT.<p>But the most important thing is that books and lectures aren't everything, so the next step isn't just about people taking the initiative to self-learn a subject, but to actually build free institutions where people can meet with others working in the field, hobbyists, etc.<p>In past popular intellectual movements, that has meant something as simple as a coffee shop.  LUGS are a good example of that kind of common interest organizing.  In the future, more structured places of intellectualism will be necessary, much like universities, but explicitly free of charge and without any purpose of degree or accreditation.<p>But hey, let's take it a step at a time. :)",1293699797

Sometimes they drop out of college because of financial problems, but still attend courses that interest them. Sometimes they choose to learn on the job, by making mistakes and fixing them, by screwing around disassembling stuff, by learning from mentors they admire, by trying out new things and so on and so forth.<p>Saying that Gates, Jobs, Zuckerberg are college dropouts really ignores that these people are/were more educated than the hordes of people coming out with master degrees. And this I think is the biggest problem with our educational system, the fact that these alternate paths aren't properly recognized.<p>Disclaimer: I'm also a college dropout, I regret it and intend to finish college, on the other hand I have a monthly revenue at least 3 times bigger than the software industry's medium salary in my city for senior developers.",1322138984

It's easy to determine what's on screen when you're about to render the frame, but you have to load every single object in memory because every single object is a ""candidate"" that <i>may</i> end up on the screen, you just don't know ahead of time. You can't <i>cull</i> the voxel tree, even though 99% of the voxel tree won't be used when rending a frame. So the memory overhead is immense.<p>Voxel trees don't make it easy to discard things that are far away at all, because there aren't any low-resolution objects that you can use for far-away objects. You have to load many objects in memory even when you use them to render just a pixel or two.<p>The polygon-based worlds we have today use various low-resolution models for when you view at a distance, and as you get closer the higher resolution models ""pop in"". This tech advertises that you have infinite detail and that there's no need for objects with different level of detail. This means that the complete point cloud of every object has to be loaded in memory and that's a very real problem and it's in complete contradiction to the claims made by the company that artists can create infinitely detailed worlds without having to worry about vertex counts or whatever. Artists have to compose their world out of re-usable high-detail objects or the sparse voxel octree will be way too large. This means the artists will be much <i>more</i> constrained than they are today, not less.",1322138240

3274089,comment,3273843,3273973,3,0,modeless,,,"It's actually the reverse! Voxels make it <i>easy</i> to figure out what's on screen and what's not. That's their main advantage over polygons. The main disadvantage is that they are generally slower to render, but as you add more details, polygon renderers waste time on details that are far away or off screen while voxel renderers can discard those more easily, and eventually there's a tipping point.<p>You're right that lighting and animation are real problems with voxels. Animation in particular is pretty much impossible, which means you have to fall back to polygons for anything that moves or changes, which in modern games is a lot of stuff.",1322136944

I feel that the programmers today are like a big suicidal herd waiting to be exploited by management people.I know that this will sound very awkward in US where the programmers may be at the same time entrepreneurs or self employed but in europe where the entrepreuneurs are crushed easily or have more dificulties, the view might be more conservative.How can I be happy when someone joins the profession, learns overnight some trendy technology and competes with me on some of the fewer and fewer jobs which seem to require less and less depth of knowledge and experience.Why are programmers so naive when all the other professions are restricting their gates through various tactics in order to mantain their advantages ?Again, this may sound extremely cinical and selfish but someone has to say it.Personally i feel myself betrayed by this profession which consumes my best but gives back less and less.Maybe it's just the crisis, maybe its like this only in europe or maybe not.",1322136431

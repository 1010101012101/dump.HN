5544804,comment,5543603,5543603,12,0,graycat,,,"It's simple:  A utility's costs for a customer are basically a fixed cost for a connection plus a variable cost for the power a customer uses.  The fixed cost pays for the astoundingly expensive equipment needed for a connection, and the variable cost pays just for the actual power.  In the US, the wholesale cost of power on the grid has long been about 0.5 cents per kWh, that is, relatively low.  I have some figures from 2007 saying that the cost of power at the plant from coal is less than 3 cents per kWh and, nuclear fission, 2 cents.<p>Now, if a lot of consumers put solar panels on their roofs but remain connected to the grid, then they will pay less to the utility which stands to fail to get back its fixed costs.<p>So, eventually the customer will get an electric bill that itemizes a much larger fixed cost for the connection and a lower variable cost for the actual power.<p>In the meanwhile, there will be a lot of 'politics' where people with solar panels want to pay not enough for the fixed cost of the grid which will mean that people without solar panels will pay too much.<p>And the people with solar panels will want to be able to sell power back to the utilities which; such power will cause engineering problems on the grid, and the solution of these problems will raise the fixed costs.<p>For the batteries, so far they are too expensive.  Same for home electric generators.  Generally a big problem with electric power is that storage is very expensive.<p>Net, for generating electric power, super tough to improve on the results of the last 100 years in electric power engineering where the power comes from falling water, burning coal, or nuclear fission.<p>In simple terms, for the grid, really no one wants power from unreliable sources such as wind and solar because (1) still need the fixed cost of the present system for when the wind is not blowing and the sun is not shining, (2) wind/solar variability can cause stability issues on the grid (to be solved by a 'smart grid', that is, more fixed cost for the grid), (3) the good wind/solar sources are generally too far from the major grid demands meaning long distance transmission lines (more cost).  My guess is that if take the subsidies away from wind and solar, then for the grid wind/solar will fall like a lead balloon.<p>Broadly, wind/solar for the grid asks us to pay for fixed cost twice, once for wind/solar and again for our current system for when wind/solar are not providing enough power.\nHeck, except for dress up, I have just one pair of shoes and wear them rain or shine -- I don't have separate shoes for rain and then shine.  I have one computer for night and day and not separate computers for each.  I want to pay for just one source of fixed cost of electric power, not one source on days with wind or sun and another source otherwise.<p>Power from wind/solar may be useful, say, for smelting aluminum, generating hydrogen from water, providing energy to make gasoline for water and coal.  Note something these three candidate uses have in common:  The output is easily stored, that is, buffered.  Then notice the problem of electric power for the grid:  The means of storage are far to inefficient.<p>For the grid, as far as I can see, wind and solar are just nonsense pushed by a 'wind/solar subsidy industry' that wants to talk people into measuring temperature not with thermometers but pictures of polar bears.<p>There is another candidate, small nukes.  So, from Japan can buy a 'box'.  In a neighborhood, dig a hole in the ground, install the box, and cover it over.  Connect the box to the grid of the neighborhood.  Then the box, just buried in its hole in the ground, provides all the electric power for the neighborhood for, say, 20 years.  The savings are maintaining the long distance power transmission from the power station to the neighborhood.  Of course the interior of the box is a nuclear fission reactor.<p>Now if my startup works and I get rich and build a nice place in the rural hills of, say, New Hampshire, then maybe I will be able to get such a box!  Also for my 4 wheel drive truck to get around in the winters, use that power to make gasoline from water and coal!  Maybe!",1365889894

It's the incredulous ""it would never happen in The Free World"" tone of the article that pisses me off.<p>Do people believe the government doesn't shut down or freeze individual sites at will?

We know the FBI collects information on non-criminal activities both in the real world and on the Internet in the event that those activities become illegal in the future. (Gore sites, for example, are being watched. It's not illegal to post gore. But when it becomes illegal, the FBI will have a list of all those people who posted on the clear Web.)<p>Do you know how easy it would be for the government to shut down the entire Internet in America? You have a few wireless operators, all heavily beholden to the federal government. You have a few cable and telco monopolies. Their executives and board members are all interchangeable, all part of the same sphere of influence  essentially a telecommunications cadre. This isn't accidental.<p>I say 10 friendly phone calls from the federal government could get 90 percent of the Internet shut down in this country inside of an hour.<p>Anyway, they haven't done it here yet.

When I contracted (for about 7 years), I was exposed to new technologies and business domains every couple of months.  I fondly remember about 2 weeks into every contract there was an 'oh sh*t' moment where I realized I was in over my head and running to keep ahead of what the client needed.  Of course, that was nicely counterbalanced by the 'aaah' moment about 6 weeks in when things were finally jelling.<p>(I mostly worked on custom web applications and ecommerce and made a decent living working 30 hours a week.)<p>If you pursue this path, you might want to consider going out on your own as a single person consulting company, rather than going through a contracting company.  You'll have more control, though less security, and will have a wider scope of project domains.  That said, if you are interested in certain types of projects (J2EE, big data) you might find it hard to contract as a one person show.<p>Of course, I don't know what your financial situation is, but if you pursue this, I'd start going to meetups, have about a year of expenses saved in the bank, and read a couple of good books like this one: <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/The-Secrets-Consulting-Getting-Successfully/dp/0932633013"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/The-Secrets-Consulting-Getting-Success...</a> and this one: <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/027363707X/002-1084596-0500848?v=glance"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/027363707X/002...</a>",1365888969

At first, I figured it was just a matter of outgrowing the positions I was hired for, and as I kept getting increasing levels of responsibility at each new position, that seemed to make sense. However, I'm starting to see a pattern where I take a new job, dig in and learn everything I can about a new tech stack and problem set, get bored and then move on, and I'm not quite sure what to make of it.<p>I started my current job 15 months ago, and yet again, I'm starting to get itchy feet. What started out as a challenging job has become routine - it's just a matter of banging out features as quickly as I can.

But supply and demand are not simple things.<p>On the one hand, an increased supply of engineers (or flaxseed) in the form of immigrants (or imports) will obviously decrease the market clearing price, and anyone who says otherwise is either ignorant of economics or engaging in sophistry.<p>But to the extent that engineers spur technological or industrial advances which benefit the entire ecosystem, the presence of additional engineers in the form of immigrants could actually increase the _demand_ for engineers. A concrete example is the marginal increase in engineering demand caused by an immigrant engineer founding a company.<p>(You could argue, given the example provided, that another company would have been founded in its absence, or that the company displaced an existing company. However, my intuition is that it's a positive-sum game, and that a successful company would created some marginal demand for engineers.)",1365887229

We did all we could to avoid the rich neighborhoods and actively sought out the poor minority neighborhoods. People in those neighborhoods with only two dollars would give one to help others. In the rich neighborhoods, they would call the police the moment they saw you. If I ever had to have a heart attack in the street, I would much rather have it in a poor neighborhood, because some kind person would help me.<p>My theory is that poor people rely on cooperation with others to survive, and this forces them to develop compassion and learn good human relations at a young age. Rich people on the other had don't need others so much, and instead are much likely be in competition with them.<p>Even in family relations this applies. Siblings in poor families offer much needed support to each other. In rich families siblings seem more likely to be considered as competitors for parental affections at a young age, and competitors for inheritance when older. This mentality of constant competition is poisonous.<p>Honestly, I think that being rich is a pretty clear path to ultimate unhappiness.

That's kind of the definition.<p>> What's the point of your post?<p>That this post was pointless spam. And further that the OP should be banned for being a shill for a poor quality site.<p>> What's wrong with viewing tech competitors as sports teams?<p>It's childish and counter-productive. You should not have loyalty to a company based purely on its brand (like a sports team), you should choose products based on what suits your needs and tastes best. Maybe for a period of time there will be one company that keeps doing that perfectly, but you should continue to examine the competition and give them a fair shake. Unlike sports teams.<p>That should be pretty obvious. I can't believe I had to explain it on here.",1363957181

5422610,comment,5420094,5421467,1,0,dalke,,,"""this company has every right to fire her if she no longer fulfills her job requirements to the company's standards""<p>My observation is that there are certain standards which are illegal for a company to use as the basis for firing someone.<p>For example, a company may not fire someone based on marital status. Even if there is a company policy that only single people may be employed at a company. Nor may an accountant be fired for wearing a yarmulke at work; some workplace religious practices being another protected policy.<p>These don't even need to be Title VII violations. It is illegal for a company (at least in Colorado, which is where this company is located) to fire a janitor who, in off-hours, enjoys being a street mime, that being a 'lawful activity off the premises of the employer during nonworking hours' and doesn't fit any of the exceptions to the law.<p>So just saying that something is unprofessional and against company policy, doesn't mean that that is lawful basis for firing someone, because acting on that policy can be illegal.<p>I think you agree with that. (I'm setting up for the next part.) Your view is instead that ""the fact that she represented her company in an unprofessional manner that led to her being fired.""<p>The problem is that the law doesn't appear to allow the company to use this form of unprofessional behavior as the basis for firing someone.<p>If it did, then any act that a company disagreed with, while done during company time, would be illegal. For example, under the NLRA a company may NOT ""prohibit you from wearing union hats, buttons, t-shirts, and pins in the workplace except under special circumstances"", even if you are on company time, representing the company, and the company policy says that wearing your union pin is ""unprofessional.""<p>The law is very clear that there are things that a company may not use as grounds for firing. Reporting sexual harassment is a protected action, public discussion of sexual discrimination in industry or at a workplace is also a protected action, public shaming of one's employer for allowing discriminatory practices is a protected action. This is well settled by the courts.<p>Now the Title VII protections only apply so long as every reasonable person would say that there was justification to believe there was discriminatory act, even if this belief ends up being false. The court cases I read are very careful to point out that employees aren't expected to know the law and that some actions, while apparently discriminatory on the surface, are actually not. Even in those cases, an incorrect claim of discrimination may not be used as the basis for firing someone.<p>Making false accusations is <i>not</i> covered by this law. An employee cannot make false claims about sexual harassment while at the workplace and expect to be protected under Title VII or similar laws. So it's not like this is a safe harbor for spreading lies and misinformation.<p>To conclude, where in all the laws and court cases that allow someone to make a <i>private</i> report of sexual harassment, without fear of reprisal through firing, does it say that making a <i>public</i> report of sexual harassment is not also protected? Because I can't find it even after several hours of research.",1363957161

5422598,comment,5417736,5419317,1,0,king_jester,,,"> First and foremost is the double standard afforded to 2nd wave bigotry. The smallest sexist offense incites a twittersphere rabble. Where is the rabble against transphobia taught by 2nd wave professors? Where is the rabble against the blatant misandry? Where is the rabble against anglo-centrism? All I've ever seen is a token effort. If these 2 men deserve to be kicked out of the convention, fired, and shamed then that more than equally applies to the bigots harbored by gender studies institutions. There's no good reason for such double standards.<p>Misandry isn't a real thing men as a whole suffer from. Works about anglo-centrism have been around for a while, although it was not a prominent part of the white mainstream feminist movement decades ago. If all you've seen is a token effort, it seems like you, like many folks, haven't had a chance to access to various material about those issues. As for gender studies, I don't know what you are even saying since I'm pretty sure bigots exist in every studied discipline and gender studies is not a bigoted discipline.<p>> 3rd wave feminists will defend the inclusion of such bigotry through the lense of postmodern relativity but again such inclusion is not afforded to ""outsiders"" and the distinction between in-group and out-group is arbitrary.<p>In what I have seen and read there is been a big increase in the criticism leveled at the big name feminist academics and writers for their moments and instances of bigotry. Exclusion of outsiders is still a problem and there is a way to go before feminism is actually inclusive or accessible for various communities.",1363957002

5422567,comment,5415256,5418659,1,0,potatolicious,,,"> <i>""You dont need permission to publish photos of historical significance.""</i><p>That's insufficient for the sort of photography I mean. There is a tremendous amount of historical value provided in even shots of the mundane. Look up the works of Henri Cartier-Bresson, Garry Winogrand, Treng Parke, among many others - these are photographers who captured regular people, in regular situations, in daily life, and in doing so provide a valuable historical record decades later.<p>The historical record of a people is, IMO, not embodied in photographs of famous politicians and actors, but rather in regular people - and to disallow their photographing by default inhibits this. The concern isn't just historical, it's also artistic - if we disallowed photography of people without explicit model releases almost all of the photography in art museums today would not exist.<p>> <i>""Or  and this can apply to street photography  if it serves a higher interest of the arts.""</i><p>That's an incredibly vague - and conservative - angle on it. Street photography has traditionally pushed the boundaries of what society finds acceptable, and for the most part it is always vindicated over time. Most of the challenging, worthwhile street photography would <i>not</i> hit the ""higher interest of the arts"" bar at the time they are taken.<p>Your standard basically means that whatever is being done has been accepted by mainstream society already as a valuable art form. Now tell me, how much of new art is already accepted by society at large at the time of creation?<p>Take a look at, for example, the work of Bruce Gilden, whose working method is still controversial today, but I for one am glad he has the freedom to do it.<p>> <i>""I think the general recommendation for street photographers is to make eye contact with who they photograph and check that way whether its ok. Also, walking up and talking to who you photographed isnt super hard.""</i><p>I do street photography almost every day. I know this - it's <i>easy</i> to get <i>permission</i>, it's hard to shove a piece of paper in someone's face and have them sign their legal rights away. The bar isn't ""subjects should be consenting"", it's ""subjects should have signed a legally binding agreement"". That is the part that is unreasonable.<p>> <i>""As I already said, photographing without publishing is nearly always ok, so you can shoot first and get permission later.""</i><p>You want to track a stranger on a street down later, put a legal agreement in front of them, and get them to sign it?<p>> <i>""The right to privacy is one of the rights defined in the German constitution  but so is the freedom of the arts.""</i><p>All around the world, almost universally, the protect of the ""arts"" extends only to what has already been deemed acceptable. Street photography still isn't recognized consistently as an art form, much less a protected one. Like I said before, to define acceptability as ""worthwhile arts"" merely protects what doesn't need protecting: art forms that mainstream society already finds palatable and desirable.",1363956519

5422559,comment,5422360,5422360,6,0,cmsj,,,"It's interesting that we still look at platforms through the lens of Microsoft's Windows. That was a platform which achieved market dominance and generated huge revenues for its creators by way of significant licensing costs. They then also sold content (typically software - Office and various back end tools) to end users at high cost and ate a huge portion of the overall software market revenue. We view high market share as winning because usually it brings high revenues and that means high margins.<p>Today we have something that looks a bit like the PC market did in the 80s - lots of competing platforms, some doing well, others not. Android has not yet achieved the market dominance that DOS/Windows did (i.e. 90+ percent) and it certainly isn't generating anywhere near the kind of revenue for its creators, Google, that DOS/Windows/Office/etc did for Microsoft. Most of the revenue instead appears to be going to Samsung, but even that is only a minority of the revenue for the whole market - by far the largest share is going to Apple.<p>So how do we define Android has having ""won""? It has no overwhelming market share, its future looks uncertain (as mentioned in the linked article) and it's only making any serious money for a company that didn't even create it. This puts the claims of winning under serious strain, but they just won't go away.<p>We should want lots of competing platforms. Competition is good for us. Trying to decide that someone has ""won"" just so we can be the one who called it most decisively, is stupid and short sighted (but understandable, given the desperation of journalists, who like Microsoft, find themselves having to shout louder and louder to be noticed at all). We should resist another dark age like the one we endured under Windows, before post-PC computing made Microsoft charmingly irrelevant.<p>Sure it's nice to grind an axe against nasty nasty Apple, or poke fun at Android selling lots of shitty cheap phones made from 2 year old OSes, or to laugh at Ballmer telling us Windows Phone is going to do really well.<p>It would be nicer if we could recognise that we have multiple really good choices available to us and that is a good thing.<p>Unfortunately we are selfish, tribal creatures, so our wallets and our social graphs will vote this into a monopoly, just like last time.",1363956435

I'd just like to point out something he didn't mention in the article: Derek was coming at this mostly from a ""User Experience"" angle. But there's a very clear business angle to this as well.<p>While most startups gloss over this fact, programming time costs money. Sure, if it's you doing the programming you're not actually paying yourself money, but that's a fiction - you're costing yourself a ton of money on opportunity costs.<p>So when you're trying to make a decision on whether to automate or not, you should also take into consideration how much money it costs to automate, versus how much it costs to program. A good programmer costs thousands of dollars a month, so spending a month building an automated billing system (for example) <i>isn't a good business decisions</i> if the alternative is paying someone $100 a month for going over 30 customers and manually doing the billing.<p>Not to mention the fact that a month spent building things that can be cheaply automate is a month farther from getting  market validation for your product.",1363956349

To receive HN upvotes you have to Show HN a product very specific to tech hackers crowd - my product is a product social network, I am sure no bootstrapped private social network would receive any attention here. Show HN small, neat, open source projects go much better than ""try my product"" Show posts. And for TC you would have to be much more high-profile than me. Like eing one backed by a famous accelerator, funded or a former early employee of Google/FB/Twitter.<p>What I am doing is dealing, progressively with three bottlenecks: visitors coming, visitors signing up and users coming back.<p>For the first one, Adwords is good enough. I spent $5 daily, receive about 300 clicks (1 or 2 cents CPC). This give me a constant flow of visitors to run the relevant experiments.<p>For the second one, I am improving right now. I have about 4% of the visitors signing up. I am changing my landing page and will do some tests to bring it, at least, 10%. Don't be tempted to focus too much on improving sign up rate right now. The only purpous of these 2 steps is to give you a good enough flow of new users so you can test your retention (or revenue per user) rate. Nothing more. The same advice for your Adwords campaign, create a good enough one, so some visitors go to your website, don't try to be a master of Adwords (for now).<p>And third, the goal of all your steps so far, retention (or generating revenue, I don't know your model). For me, having 30+ new users each day is enough for me testing my retentions with different tactics. If you need more than this, than you might raise your Adwords daily budget, or try a little more to improve your sign up rate. But fix your number of new users I just work hard enough to match this number.<p>When you have a good enough number of daily new users, than your work on marketing match with your goal to deliver value to your customers, and then good enough is no more enough. This is when you must excel on testing, iterating and improving your product. With no excuses as ""only if people knew what I am doing""....<p>Good luck!",1363956236

This wiki has starting material about the institutional and systemic effects of racism: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Institutional_racism"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Institutional_racism</a>.<p>> why do all these mental gymnastics just so you can say X cannot be racist towards Y? Why even say something like that? I can't see if having any positive outcome.<p>You have to remember that for someone who is black, the institutional racism in the US effects them daily and that such institutional racism is orchestrated by the white patriarchy that is US society. For such a person, what does it mean when a white person tries to call them racist while ignoring the racism that said white person benefits from every day? Often I will see a white or white passing person call a person of color racist when the situation they are talking about is actually caused by the systemic racism that they benefit from.<p>> You can find areas of the world where almost any given race has the power/upper hand and are ""racist"" towards them.<p>That is true, but that doesn't really have anything to do with the context of this discussion. Racism in different societies are not interchangeable in most discussions of racism.<p>> My point is you cannot simply say X cannot be racist towards Y because it can, has and will happen and all levels<p>This is not true. Black people will never be able to exercise systemic racism against white people in US society. Black people will never be able to create an environment where white people are imprisoned more than any other group by proportion, denied access to jobs, denied access to self determination, target white people with racist law enforcement, have over-representation in government, etc.<p>> Either at an individual level, a social group level (X friends won't be friends with Ys) or a social/society level anyone race CAN be racist towards another.<p>Racism at a society level different compared to individual acts of racism.

I'm pretty sure it could be scripted (go through all HN topics, check downvotes etc. you could make this reasonably scientific). The point is still, should we even care? Why must we feel like there is a need to shape this fact or alter it according to some PC dogma?  Let's be tolerant and leave the community to downvote/upvote as it wants.  If it reaches a critical mass then those taking offense will find a way of reacting appropriately (downvoting anti-feminist posts, stop posting on HN, etc.)  If HN posters are for the majority anti-feminist, then it is.  There will be some people that take offense to this, other's not.  The assumption that we can't offend or be offended needs to be questioned.",1363953924
5422415,comment,5421908,5422280,1,0,doktrin,,,"My <i>hunch</i>, based in part on a few single point observations as well as this thread, is that not too many <i>new</i> projects are using Perl.<p>When I asked a prospective employer why they were using Perl, the answer was in effect that it was legacy from the late 90's. I never got the impression that this legacy was an onerous impediment, however. Given the scale at which they operate, switching languages & ecosystems would be costly - and (again, due to scale) they've built up a number of customized solutions using Perl that would be time consuming to port.<p>IMHO, given the state of the language & its ecosystem as compared to its closest cousins (Ruby & Python), I can't really see why any <i>new</i> projects would be started in Perl. If anyone has a counter point I would certainly love to hear it, as I will freely admit to not having had much interaction with the Perl community as of late.",1363953904

I don't think there is anything to prevent the amendment process from working, other than some weird cultural issues behind people thinking ""that's not something you do anymore"", like somehow amendments are miracles and since the sacrifice of Jesus there aren't any more miracles in the world (just as an analogy of a thing people believe, not an endorsement of said belief).<p>It's just too easy to test the legal envelope without any repercussions. Don't like the limits on your power that the Constitution has in place? Pass the law you want anyway and see if anyone notices. Fake-it-till-you-make-it. The Constitution means whatever fantasy Congress and the President says it means, redefined words and all. In order for <i>The People</i> to be secure, <i>the people</i> need to have their personal security violated. In order for <i>Freedom</i> to live on, <i>freedom</i> must be curtailed. It's not until the Supreme Court has someone shove it in their face too hard for them to ignore it that anyone even starts to look at the provisions of these bills. And then the same guys who passed the first one just try again, often with nearly identical wording to the last time, until everyone is just too damned tired to keep fighting.<p>Let's create an Amendment to hold congresscritters accountable--say, with jail time--for passing laws that violate the Constitution. The Constitution is law with most of its provisions lacking codified punishments. I think only Treason is defined with an explicit punishment in the Constitution. If the Supreme Court decides a law gets struck down because it is unconstitutional, then all the names on the list of sponsors for the bill go to jail. The Amendment could be that all new Amendments must have a codified punishment and all previous Amendments need to have punishments amended to them.<p>Stop Cowboy Government.",1363953830

""Retarded"" is very obviously the more pejorative term. Personally I avoid using the term ""retarded"" because of the extremely negative/unpleasant connotations surrounding the use of the term ""retard"" in our culture. I know that by invoking either of those words I could make people with handicapped loved ones feel uncomfortable. Yes for now the full choice of my vocabulary is curtailed, but it's called consideration, and it makes you and the people around you feel good. In the meantime there's plenty of other enjoyable/juicy/harmless words to use for something you want to criticise.",1363953790

Most of the C#/.NET developers are already working in, well, C# and .NET, usually in enterprisey environments and often with little or no contact with open-source community. Also (and this is purely my own subjective view, of someone who worked 5+ years almost exclusively with .NET, before switching completely to OSS stack and Ruby) Mono feels like a second-class platform, orbiting around .NET. I personally wouldn't like to work in Mono as it feels a bit like betraying both realms, OSS and MS, regardless of how good the platform itself and the tools are. And I believe that at least VS can't be replaced that easily with OSS alternatives.",1363953602

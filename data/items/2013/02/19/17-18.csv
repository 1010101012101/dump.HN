They're not getting promoted, obviously, <i>because</i> they're the best. Their company cannot afford to have them leave their current position.<p>The other side to that, though, is not that they necessarily <i>want</i> to be promoted, they just want more compensation and/or new challenges. A maximum wage for a job isn't acceptable if it's going to drive your best employee out of your office. If you can't promote someone who deserves it, compensate based on skill, not job title. And if Joe is your go-to guy who is a wizard at Java but is bored, try delegating some of his easier work elsewhere (is it <i>really</i> critical to have it tomorrow?) and encourage him to come up with some solutions on his own, to problems <i>he's</i> facing at work.<p>""Never promote your best person"" is a good idea, and certainly it looks like the numbers back it up.

Allow me to respond.<p>I have seen people ruined with medical bills.<p>There are many reasons why the system is dysfunctional, and I'm aware of nearly all of them.<p>Did you know that a round of cancer treatment in the US can cost over $500,000, and even if you are fully insured with a good policy you can have a 20% copay required, meaning that with insurance you still personally have to pay $100,000 or more? That sort of thing is what is bankrupting people and is why most medical bankruptcies involved people who were fully insured.<p>That's assuming your insurance policy wasn't subject to ""recission"", which is legal retroactive cancellation of the policy as soon as you have any condition like cancer that would cost a lot to treat.<p>We have a for-profit medical industry, and a for-profit insurance industry and both are motivated to increase profits, and reducing care is often a way to do it. Even non-profit hospitals will price gouge. Non-profit status does not mean that the executives working there aren't paid large salaries, it doesn't mean that things are delivered at cost, or with minimal mark up.<p>The ""reform"" is mandating people buy insurance from for-profit insurance companies, with no cost controls. Thus we end up with policies that can cost a family $20,000 a year in premiums, while still having large co-pays that can bankrupt you. The parts of the law that would have provided socialized care for the poor were gutted by the Supreme Court review, and by the executive office rule directives interpreting the law.<p>The answer to the problem is single-payer. The reform system is a further bailout for industry and is already driving up costs and reducing the number of insured.<p>Your posts presents those of us who support a reasonable working solution of single-payer as a position of hypocrisy, inconsistency, and/or ignorance, because we don't accept a non-working solution that retains and increases out of control costs and profits for industry.<p>Not supporting a specific, bad solution does not mean one does not see there is a serious problem and reform is necessary.",1361296409

Aside from emergency department, health care providers are generally free to refuse care for patients they believe cannot pay except in the case of a life-threatening emergency.<p>What this means is that in the USA it's common for people to have to allow earlier-stage, less expensive to treat problems develop into serious problems before finally going into the ED to seek treatment.  Which increases all of our health care costs overall.  Not only does the problem that eventually gets treated end up being more expensive than it needed to be, but the place where the care is provided is also the most expensive option.  And since they don't pay, health care providers are forced to raise everyone else's rates to cover the cost of this unnecessarily expensive care that they had to provide.<p>Long story short, the range of things that health care providers have to treat is much wider in countries with more socialized systems than it is in the USA.

He considered the US system “absolutely unmanageable”.</i><p><i>However long this goes on for, they'll continue throwing resources at this individual and never show a single sheet of figures to any of his relatives. Not because they'll get anything back, but because this is what the NHS does. It’s free care for throat cancer sufferers who only gave up smoking four years afterwards, for drinkers who were told 35 years ago that if they didn’t quit drinking they’d die. Free care for American immigrants, for jerks and gents. Free care for parents whether they showed up or not. Free care for guys who tried to try. Free care for the only father I will ever have.</i><p>So here comes the TANSTAAFL argument: I don't think anyone argues that what the OP describes is a ""bad thing""...in fact, I think it's probably the dream scenario that people optimistically assume is the case before they have their first encounter with an emergency room.<p>But the reason why it doesn't happen is because of cost, plain and simple. And to be concerned about cost is not just the domain of greedy insurers and fat cat cost cutters, but of reasonable people who understand that preventive care is less dramatic than end-of-life care, but is surely as deserving of resources and attention. And both types of care rely on the same limited pot of funding.<p>It's easy to be emotionally invested in the personal case of a man who is lucky enough to have a loved one so eloquent with words. But what about the hundreds, thousands of routine cases that are treated by NHS with a protocol governed by cost limitations, limitations that will inevitably be imposed by the decision to give blue-chip treatment to the untreatable?<p>These routine cases don't pull at the heart strings because it is the nature of the human mind not to realize/dwell on how an exam/procedure not scheduled two years ago is the main factor in the chronic disease one suffers today. And yet these people are just as deserving of optimal treatment as OP's Bill. The way that OP judges the value of healthcare, though, means that the Bill's will get a greater share of a finite set of resources. Is this really the way an optimal healthcare system should work?<p>This is not to say that the U.S. or any other system is currently better than the NHS. It's just to point out that fashion in which the OP (positively) judges the NHS is susceptible to being ignorant of the problems that occur earlier in the pipeline of health.",1361295649

The political conversation today is focused around jobs, and job creation.  But its kind of deceiving.  Our problem isn't that we can't find enough work for people, its that we can't find enough unskilled, or low skilled work for people.  If you've ever spent months looking for a person, in this ""high unemployment"" era.  It'll be obvious to you too, and it's not simply a matter of having unrealistic expectations.<p>We've entered a new era of employment.  It used to be that you could just take a high school student, assume he'll have what you need, then spend a few years mentoring him to fill in the rest.  Today, that generic mold doesn't work.  A lot of companies are carving value out of doing things more efficiently, and often that means finding people with very specific sets of skills.<p>Online education is EXTREMELY useful for this.  I personally was able to get my current job by watching online lectures.  I certainly wasn't an expert on the subject, but at the very least I was capable of demonstrating how capable i was to learn it on my own.  Formalizing this process would only help this process!<p>If online education isn't working for some students, I don't think we should be questioning whether online education is the right path.  Clearly it's necessary, and the small successes its had now has proven that it has potential.  Instead of going backwards, we should be asking how we can go forwards.",1361295103

5245576,comment,5237967,5243625,5,0,wilhelm,,,"> Is the Opera you knew gone? That depends on what the Opera you knew was.<p>The Opera Software I knew and loved was a technology company filled with some of the most brilliant engineers I have ever met. Despite being a tiny company halfway across the world from where the real action happened, it managed to conjure up some amazing stuff.<p>The financial margins were slim, the salaries crappy, and the the roof of our derelict office building was literally leaking. But that was _fine_, as we were all in this together. Even the new guy received token stock options, owning a tiny share of something big.<p>The company culture was egalitarian. Decisions were not made in some ivory tower, but the CEO himself would roam the hallways, discussing with individual engineers. Even as the company passed 500 employees, we managed to retain very much of the startup culture.<p>The company had its share of problems, of course. Problems that, if not solved, would doom the company long term. Opera tried to be all things to all people, completely lacking focus. It allowed itself to be pushed around by OEMs that didn't understand the browser game. Its greatest strength was that the engine was portable to any platform, any device. But this was gained at a huge penalty to the development speed and agility.<p>With the lacking focus, Opera also failed to understand the importance of design. Having engineers in charge is great. Having engineers in charge of _design_ is a terrible, terrible idea. Opera was a great engine - with a very mediocre UI.<p>However, most worrying of all was that Opera grew complacent from having unsurpassed standards support, the fastest rendering engine, and so on. When things got difficult, one would blame Microsoft, as if taking the moral high ground would make any difference.<p>The decline and fall of Opera has been a gradual process. Just praising the old regime and blaming the new is too easy, too simple.<p>As the competition came back to the game around 2003-2004, Opera wasn't too slow to react. It didn't react at all. We should have thrown out that ugly ad-banner instantly. Dropped the old paid model the moment Phoenix came into existence. We should have made the project open source the moment Safari/WebKit became public. Or even better: before.<p>I was just a 20-yearold brat when I joined in 2004, fresh out of high school. I don't blame management for not listening to me then. But I'm sad that they didn't figure this stuff out themselves.<p>From there on, we were playing the catch-up game half the time, and pushing the boundaries of the Web the other half. I remember the rush to get XHR ready to ship just after Google Maps made use of it in 2005, making our browser look pretty bad. But I also remember the scramble to support Acid2 (2006) first, the rush to remain on top of the layout performance benchmarks - and the crazy experiments we did. Opera Platform, which was essentially Firefox OS many years ahead of its time, was pretty cool.<p>The platform work we did was amazing, too. We had the full web available on the most crappy devices you can imagine. The release of the Motorola A1200 (2005) was one of my proudest achievements. As was the fantastic adaptive zoom we made for the Wii (2006). The iPhone, made public a little later, had the exact same feature as we had come up with.<p>Apple and Mozilla's products, at this time, struggled with the same site compatibility issues as we did in this Microsoft era. But unlike us, they were focused on shipping one thing well. Their products became nice and pretty, while ours looked like something out of a hobbyist shed.<p>I believe our engine was _better_ than the competition for a very long time, but we kept shooting ourselves in the foot. Over and over again. And by this time, the competition was picking up speed. They were loading the big guns, while we were not.<p>Even as the money started coming into the company in 2006-2009, we failed to make the necessary investments in our future. I became department manager in 2007, and remember losing people over petty salary issues. Minor to the company, but significant to the employee. Some of the people I lost I had to hire two new guys to replace - and train for a year before they could really step up. Man-years of wasted productivity, thanks to the holy quarterly numbers.<p>Not to mention the failed projects we poured resources into, draining all departments for the people they needed just to _catch_up_ to the competition. (Opera employees will know what I'm referring to. :)<p>Or the fact that when the testing systems I was in charge of became a major bottleneck of our development process, I had to scavenge discarded hardware from the trash to speed it up. I don't even want to know how many developer hours were wasted waiting for test results. I offered to have my recruitment budget cut to zero if I could just have the damned servers I needed to do my job, but burning out my team was apparently a better option.<p>These were just some of the issues I could see from where I was standing. Elsewhere in the organization, there were similar issues. Many of these things improved over the years, but it was too little, too late.<p>And as the old regime was slowly replaced by the new, they started making new mistakes. The way the 2008 reorganization was handled was atrocious. I kept my mouth shut then, to keep my department from worrying. The 2010 layoffs is a story of its own.<p>It eventually dawned on me that upper management didn't actually give a shit about the rank-and-file employees. We had become replaceable cogs in the machine. They abused the startup culture for a long while. Despite good margins, salaries were kept crappy, playing on the engineers' idealistic love for what they were doing. The token options were soon gone, too. The leftover money turned into impressive bonuses for the selected few.<p>We knew from the start that Opera Mini (2005) was a transitional technology, to be made obsolete as devices became more powerful. But there was no plan then, and I doubt there is any sensible plan now, for how to remain relevant after that era is over. We started with the best, most portable engine, and were surpassed by the competition while we were asleep.<p>The desktop browser has remained stagnant for years.

Think about the comparison: The 9/11 attacks DID force a nation into an actual, real war (two, actually, in Iraq and Afghanistan, and three if you want to count the generic ""War on Terror"" that was stepped up dramatically after the attack). The war in Afghanistan has become the longest in United States history, and those wars together HAVE clearly helped set in motion a series of events that will dictate the balance of power in the Middle East for a generation to come, from the deposition and removal of dictators by force to the Arab Spring to the ongoing civil war in Syria. Though there was no contiguous threat in the Middle East to rival Nazi Germany, the Middle East was and is still characterized by a number of oppressive dictatorships.<p>Did post-9/11 have the same economic effects for the US as the post-WWII era? No, but that's not really the effect of any particular difference between the events that precipitated WWII and the wars of the last decade. And, if anything, the post-9/11 landscape HAS seen a dramatic shift in the global balance of power, specifically in challenges to US supremacy and an internal reconsideration of how we project the power we do have.<p>The point to be made here, which I think backs up the whole ""digital attack as next Pearl Harbor"" argument, is that unconventional warfare is the new conventional warfare. We're less likely to see a direct military challenge along the lines of Pearl Harbor, and much more likely to see indirect challenges to US supremacy through digital or terrorist attacks.

I also run a lot.<p>Right now, my diet probably consists of around 40% protein, 40% carbs, and 20% fat, to slightly varying degrees per week.<p>I watch what I eat and study what I eat quite a bit, though. I've tried the ketosis thing, the low-carb thing, the good high-carb thing. The only thing I've not tried was the high good-fat diet, because I tend to break out and/or get really oily skin when I eat fatty stuff. (Having said that, my skin was the best when I was ovo-lacto vegetarian.)<p>As everyone has said, each body is very different and the way your body uses what as fuel differs depending on your lifestyle.<p>Having said that, I do believe everyone has a ""sweet spot"". That is, a diet and exercise regime that works almost perfectly. I've read people that have been weight training for years that say they go into ketosis with around 100g of carbs a day. Many say this is impossible, but I've seen pictures of the dudes, and unless those aren't his, he seems to be doing extremely well. Personally, I could never go into ketosis with nowhere near that amount.<p>What I also found to be true is that you can either have lots of carbs and protein and little fat, or lots of fat and protein and little carbs. If you have lots of fat and lots of carbs at the same time, you will get fat quickly. The whole .8g to 1.5g per kilo (of your weight) for protein seems to work for me, as well.<p>Another thing that I've noticed that is very important, and this is with regard to what you say about insulin, is monitoring your glycemic index levels, because this is another way you can get fat. Unfortunately, this can be tricky, because theoretically, even fruits can get you fat once you consider the excess increase/energy that you do not expend.<p>Lastly, macronutrients!

Saw that it wasn't crazy to do a sub 4 hour, so I set my pace accordingly.

Audiobooks are wonderful, though.  Especially stuff that's light, escapist, and fun but somewhat embarrassing: I listened to most of the Harry Potter books, for example.  If you're disciplined enough to only listen to the books when you're running, it can be a surprisingly strong motivator.<p>Second Edit: (now I'm nostalgic) I also don't recommend a 2 mile warm up jog to the start of the race (I lived on Fell at the time).",1361293647
5245448,comment,5243389,5243937,2,0,bitwize,,,"Oh God. Don't get me started on const.<p><pre><code>    const char * const fuck_this(const char *shit) const;\n</code></pre>\nThing #1: In C++ the word ""const"" can mean many things depending on position and inflection: declaring a symbol an actual constant; a pointer argument has in (as opposed to in-out) semantics; a function has no side effects. I keep forgetting which use of const does what.<p>Thing #2: Each use of const, regardless of meaning, induces a different <i>type</i>. Which makes API design a pain in the ass since you can't pass in stuff that wasn't declared with the same constness if the procedure expects const parameters without casting the parameters. I actually worked on a codebase where a guy broke much of our code by checking in a ""fix"" for our APIs to make them comply with what he considered best practice regarding constness.<p>Thing #3: Passed-in pointers and references are not 'const' by default. You should have to declare intent to clobber their referents.<p>Thing #4: And as someone said downthread, you can cast around it in most cases anyways.<p>This is why I say, if you're thinking of using C++, reach for Ada instead. Ada's reputation has been necessarily tainted by whiners complaining about its verbosity. But I swear that figuring out a page of Ada code is easier than figuring out a few lines of sufficiently complicated C++. For one thing, in Ada, function/procedure parameters are 'in' (i.e., const) by default, and you must declare intent to modify parameters in side effects by declaring them 'in out'.",1361293639

Its just a condition that avoids distraction in discussing the aspects you usually want to focus on, which is the payoff matrix.<p>What changes it is if the payoff matrix is wrong, as it was in this case. The game theoretic aspects of PD are entirely dependent on the ordering of the payoffs such that the payoffs for strategies are (listing, in each scenario, the strategy of the actor whose payoff is under consideration first, and that of the other actor second) as follows: (defect, cooperate) > (cooperate, cooperate) > (defect, defect) > (cooperate, defect), which makes (defect, defect) the only Nash Equilibrium in the game and makes defection a dominant strategy since it always produces a better outcome than cooperation independent of the opponent's strategy. (Note, so long as this payoff matrix is maintained, communication is mostly irrelevant, since even knowing what the opponent is planning on doing, defection is always your best choice.)<p>Changing the matrix, as was done here, so that the order is (cooperate, cooperate) > (defect, cooperate) > (defect, defect) > (cooperate, defect) makes both (cooperate, cooperate) and (defect, defect) Nash Equilibria and makes it so there is no dominant strategy. It also makes having clear indication of the other players intent (as is the case when the class is gathered outside of the door and can respond to each others actions) significant (as it is not in a pure PD) because then if there is a clear indication of intended action (which differs from a communicated plan, which can be a deception, and which in a pure PD almost certainly would be, since each player not only has an incentive to defect independent of the other player's strategy, but also an incentive to mislead the other player into cooperating) it makes sense to match it, since the best payoffs are always in matching the other players action -- whether cooperation or defection.",1361293586

5245392,story,,,1,1,bpatrianakos,"Ask HN: How would you focus this app into something useful?",,"Distraction-free text editors seem to be all the rage right now. It feels like they're the new todo app. A couple of years ago I made one for myself to suit my own needs then rewrote the entire thing and opened it up to the public. As time goes on I see that it's evolving into more of a ""platform"" for writing than yet another pretty text editor.<p>So my question is, how would all you smart people in the HN community pivot and focus this project into something useful people want to use that differentiates itself from the plethora of other similar projects?<p>The URL is https://writeapp.me (please excuse the really bad homepage, the app itself is actually nice). The original goal was to have a pretty writing environment to store writing and publish it publicly if you want to. It has now evolved into a ""platform"" where you can:<p>- Edit online or from any smartphone via the mobile web app<p>- Save and publish directly from Sublime Text via the plugin I built<p>- Store and publish via the CLI tool I'm building<p>- Save and publish via SMS<p>- Save and publish via email<p>- Make any writing publicly available at https://writeapp.me/your-username<p>I feel like this can become a pretty useful tool if I could focus it. I'm not trying to start a startup with it at all, I just want to build a tool that makes writing something you can do from anywhere, using any tool, and is pretty to look at.",1361293200

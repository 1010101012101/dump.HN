How about if I explicitly ask him for it? Or if I am clearly an uninformed water customer, and don&#x27;t know that the brand of water I am buying is nowhere near as good quality as the other brand he hasn&#x27;t told me about?<p>For the other two cases I agree with your assessment, though I&#x27;m not sure that it is strictly &quot;rational to extend basic good will to others&quot;. I do think that is the right course of action, I just don&#x27;t think it is rational. That kind of behaviour is rational in situations where it might be reciprocated, but when no-one is going to know either way, I think that good will is only extended as a cultural artifact (which is a very good thing!)",1378108797

6313985,comment,6313661,6313661,8,0,jballanc,,,"I&#x27;ve often said that English is to programming as Latin is to medicine. Programmers will be writing &quot;if&quot; statements and &quot;for&quot; loops long after no one uses &quot;if&quot; or &quot;for&quot; in daily conversation.<p>So it is as important for programmers to understand English as it is for doctors to understand Latin. Of course, most doctors may <i>understand</i> Latin, but they wouldn&#x27;t be able to <i>converse</i> in Latin. In that sense, English is also the programmer&#x27;s lingua franca.<p>That term -- lingua franca -- is an interesting one. In addition to being used as a colloquialism for &quot;a common language&quot; it was also, itself, a language: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mediterranean_Lingua_Franca"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mediterranean_Lingua_Franca</a> .

Process implies trusting central server for cryptographic operations, which is very insecure. Central server should only be used as transport mechanism and should not be in any way involved in cryptographic operations that include working with secret keys. If someone, for example, seizes control of server (for government agencies this is an easy task, especially in these days) then he could forge user&#x27;s public keys. The fact that public key is hardcoded in client application doesn&#x27;t solve the problem either. What if server key is compromised?

Is there something you couldn&#x27;t be taught by a private school?<p>> A problem of capitalism is that the same self-interested motives which can be harnessed for productive activity can equally be harnessed for activities which provide private benefit but social costs (see negative externalities above).<p>So they can, but that won&#x27;t change. No matter how much Coercion you throw around, there will always be some people who don&#x27;t give a fuck about other people, or nature, or whatever.<p>On the other hand, self-interest can also guide people towards minimizing externalities. For example, Apple knows its customers don&#x27;t want nature to get raped, so they go through a lot of trouble to produce computers in a &quot;greener&quot; way.<p>> Written by someone who&#x27;s either never heard of, or is unable to admit, slavery, coercion, blackmail, forced options, and other circumstances in which decisions are made under duress or lack of any feasible alternative.<p>Well, I didn&#x27;t say that voluntary exchanges <i>constitute</i> all economic activity ever. On top of that <i>basis</i>, there&#x27;s room for non-voluntary exchanges too. The point was that an economy is a massive &quot;network&quot; of voluntary exchanges. But I don&#x27;t think coercion is relevant here. For example, it&#x27;s safe to assume that slavery or blackmail have nothing to do with any of the exchanges you&#x27;ve made in your life.<p>> Not if the game is structured to explicitly benefit one side or the other. E.g., &quot;contracts of adhesion&quot;, monopoly provision of communications or broadband services, toll authorities, agribusiness conglomerates structuring &quot;intellectual property&quot; laws to forbid saving and planting of seed grain, eternal copyright extension, etc., etc.<p>What do you think the source of these particular problems might be? Hint: It&#x27;s not Capitalism. What might it be that &quot;structures&quot; &quot;the game&quot;?<p>> Identified problems in one area of a practice doesn&#x27;t mean a freedom from problems and conflicts elsewhere. So your conclusion is largely moot and void.<p>I can&#x27;t tell what you mean by that. But here&#x27;s a mysterious statement right back at you: Humanity involves intractable problems.",1378107803

I don&#x27;t know the answer, whether empirical or subjective, but I have a (subjective) suspicion that there&#x27;s a fair bit of confirmation bias going on. What percentage of diners share pictures of their food on instagram? How many people take selfies? I don&#x27;t suppose anyone has actually collected that data, we can&#x27;t quite say how much is too much, and since some of these behaviors may well be annoying, people quickly enter confirmation bias mode. Besides, the problem is not phones, it&#x27;s people. Phones just give us an avenue to run away from ourselves. I&#x27;m not on my phone at the birthday party because I have a smartphone, I&#x27;m on the smartphone because it helps avoid the awkward silence and contrived conversations that would otherwise prevail. If you were sharing a bed with someone you find hot, say some star or someone you&#x27;ve been crazy about but couldn&#x27;t get around to telling them how you feel, I doubt you&#x27;d be staring at your phone with that person in bed next to you. So the problem is not the phones, it&#x27;s the quality of our relationships and interaction, and those won&#x27;t change or improve just because we&#x27;ve put the phone away.

We could assume this trend continues into the future, and that any crypto algorithm we <i>do</i> create will be broken within 20 years. This means that encrypting a piece of data isn&#x27;t some magical eternal protection--it just seals it in a time-capsule that&#x27;ll &quot;degrade&quot; after 20 years or less. (Sometimes far less.)<p>But, so far, this property has also been pretty much irrelevant: almost all the things we want to do by passing along a secret are time-sensitive, and breaking the secret 20 years after the fact doesn&#x27;t really buy you anything. Being able to impersonate the SSL key of Microsoft.com-as-it-was-in-1993 doesn&#x27;t let you do anything to Microsoft.com-as-it-is-today.<p>This policy scales down, of course: in military comsec terms, you only need the encryption on operational details to last until the day after the operation is carried out. After that, your &quot;secret&quot; has become &quot;plain&quot; (something quite obviously blew up, etc.) and so the enemy breaking the encryption on the orders won&#x27;t tell them anything they didn&#x27;t already realize by hearing the explosion.<p>This is why the military keeps multiple different kinds of ciphers for different levels of secrecy, by the way: they assume that the more things they use a particular crypto algorithm for--the more signals the enemy gets to intercept that use that algorithm--the more enemy sigint folks will be put to the task of breaking that algorithm. So &quot;top secret&quot; encryption isn&#x27;t meant to withstand any more scrutiny than &quot;secret&quot; encryption; it&#x27;s just generally a bunch of orthogonal crypto primitives to the ones in the merely-secret crypto, and only used rarely, for the kinds of orders that need to stay secret long after execution (e.g. covert ops on allies.) Thus, enemy nations will have comparatively little reason to have analyzed and broken it--and breaking the secret-level ciphers won&#x27;t help them, because of the orthogonal implementations.",1378106048

Take someone from 1750, drop him in the world of 1500, and things would have been pretty familiar.  Move 250 years in the other direction and he&#x27;d be hard-pressed to make heads or tails of anything (assuming you&#x27;re taking someone from a part of the developed world -- for the developing world, the changes would be less pronounced, but still likely significant).",1378105551

Outside of English-speaking countries, and particularly in the Schengen area, teams are made up of people whose first language isn&#x27;t the local language. This means that all internal communication happens in English. Companies that make an effort to operate in English internally have a much, much easier time hiring.<p>2. Investment often comes from outside the country, particularly from the US, even if your company doesn&#x27;t operate or sell outside of its home country. Your CEO is going to have to pitch your company in English, and your investors are going to have foreigners perform their due diligence.",1378105352

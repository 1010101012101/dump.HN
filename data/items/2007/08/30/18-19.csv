The threat is what it does to your determination.  When the startup seems hopeless you can easily drop it and make consulting your focus.<p>If you're determined enough, you'll come up with a plan to maintain that determination even if consulting goes well and the startup goes terribly.",1188500169

48330,comment,48294,48294,0,0,geebee,,,"50% sounds like really good odds to me, given the payout.  It depends to some extent on what it means to fail, and how long it takes to succeed.  But if your odds of a substantial payout are 50%, and the length of time to get to success or failure is less than 4 years, then these are phenomenal odds.  <p>Of course, it's not just money - you ""pay"" in other ways.  If it takes, say, 4 years to get to the success or failure point, then some people will have worked for over 12 years with grim determination and still never quite nail it.  I wonder if this is a memory-less process (ie., how does a previous failure affect your future attempts?).  Wisdom and exhaustion in equal parts, I'd suspect, and only one side is going to win.

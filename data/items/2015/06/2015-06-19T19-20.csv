9747260,comment,9746427,9746948,0,0,shykes,,,"> <i>It&#x27;s humorous that what you just said goes exactly opposite to the blog post, which talks about how docker is designed to do everything completely differently because current methods &quot;don&#x27;t scale&quot;.</i><p>I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s contradictory. We <i>do</i> want Docker to change, for the better, the way applications are built and run. And if you <i>do</i> want to throw away your existing stack and build your next application in the most portable and scalable way possible, then Docker can definitely help. It&#x27;s just that it doesn&#x27;t <i>require</i> you to, because most people don&#x27;t upgrade everything at once: they improve their toolbox gradually.<p>For example, there is a meme that &quot;if you run more than one process in Docker, you&#x27;re doing it wrong&quot;. I actually disagree with that. I think if you want to transpose an existing VM into a container, and think of it as a mini-server that you ssh into, that is your prerogative and Docker should support that use case. Maybe later you will look into the benefits of breaking up your application into smaller, single purpose containers (for example, you can now the Docker API and ecosystem at a finer level of granularity). And when you do, Docker should support that use case too.<p>A small disgression: I think it&#x27;s unfortunate that the tech community feels the need to coalesce around polarizing &quot;you&#x27;re doing it wrong&quot; statements. I find it particularly unfortunate that <i>Docker</i>, a tool I created partly to make the development world <i>less</i> polarized, was chosen as a battleground for ideological battles that I find frankly boring... Everything doesn&#x27;t have to be a battle.<p>> <i>Keep up the good work on docker though, it seems to be getting some good traction so far! I&#x27;m personally wondering if it&#x27;s more fashion based traction though, and someone will be inventing the next &quot;docker, but more buzzword&quot; before long.</i><p>Thanks.<p>Obviously it will be hard for me to answer that in an unbiased way. I think the &quot;fashion&quot; aspect is a matter of perspective. From the point of view of heavy Hacker News and Twitter users, there is a lot of hype, both positive and negative. But the huge majority of Docker users don&#x27;t hang out on Hacker News (if they even know what it is). They have a job to do, Docker helps them do that job, and they tell their friends and colleagues about it.<p>We&#x27;ve tried to invite as many real-world users of Docker at next week&#x27;s Dockercon, to talk about their experiences, both good and bad. Maybe watch a few of their presentations and decide for yourself if it feels like &quot;fashion&quot; :)",1434743900

Adding the weight improves the experience of using the mouse. How does adding weight to headphones improve the experience?

So mostly keeping things really simple is way better than having everything extremly loosly (so that you could change parts as you grow). Let&#x27;s consider ForeignKeys as an example and / or Transaction. Having them keeps you going really really fast, but as you grow some of the Database needs to be splitted and so that ForeignKeys don&#x27;t work anymore especially when you introduce the model that every service needs to have his own data service. Okai that example wasn&#x27;t that good, but let&#x27;s go further, it&#x27;s way easier to have a transaction in a single application than when you need to have some kind of a transaction go over multiple microservices.<p>Also take filesystem access for an example, if you just have a &quot;few&quot; different places where you do that you should do it. But that  is not a good design for growth, but a design for keeping things simple, it&#x27;s just not necessary to have some Kind of interfaces and file service abstractions just to have an easy way to replace that kind of stuff.<p>Most things I&#x27;m writing is stuff that I learned over the past years, that some things work and some things not. 
Back to the topic, Docker is great, I already said that, but it doesn&#x27;t fit in the use case of everybody. 
And still most things Docker trying to solve are already solved (like application deploying, or prod and dev should nearly be identical [whatever that means..] (vagrant)), still nobody has found a good solution in scaling simple SQL Databases, when running them on your own hardware.<p>Edit: Fixed some spelling mistakes, god it&#x27;s hard to write that late.",1434743028

9747170,story,,,1,1,AndreyKarpov,"Unreal Engine code issues are fixed by the third-party company",," Our company develops, promotes, and sells the PVS-Studio static code analyzer for C/C++ programmers. However, our collaboration with customers is not limited solely to selling PVS-Studio licenses. For example, we often take on contract projects as well. Due to NDAs, we&#x27;re not usually allowed to reveal details about this work, and you might not be familiar with the projects names, anyway. But this time, we think you&#x27;ll be excited by our latest collaboration. Together with Epic Games, we &#x27;re working on the Unreal Engine project. This is what we&#x27;re going to tell you about in this article.<p>As a way of promoting our PVS-Studio static code analyzer, we&#x27;ve thought of an interesting format for our articles: We analyze open-source projects and write about the bugs we manage to find there. Take a look at this updatable list of projects we have already checked and written about. This activity benefits everyone: readers enjoy learning from others&#x27; mistakes and discover new means to avoid them through certain coding techniques and style. For us, it&#x27;s a way to have more people learn about our tool. As for the project authors, they too benefit by gaining an opportunity to fix some of the bugs.<p>Among the articles was &quot;A Long-Awaited Check of Unreal Engine 4&quot;. Unreal Engine&#x27;s source code was extraordinarily high quality, but all software projects have defects and PVS-Studio is excellent at surfacing some of the most trickiest bugs. We ran an analysis and reported our findings to Epic. The Unreal Engine team thanked us for checking their code, and quickly fixed the bugs we reported. But we didn&#x27;t want to stop there, and thought we should try selling a PVS-Studio license to Epic Games.<p>Coninue read: https://www.unrealengine.com/blog/how-pvs-studio-team-improved-unreal-engines-code",1434742981

This isn&#x27;t to trivialize that overhead (or our frequent failure to minimize it), but  complexity is more in whether the abstractions offered for dealing with a problem demand as little attention as possible.<p>Good tools/abstractions categorically reduce the number of details users have to pay attention to, and correctly pick the prominent ones most relevant to the problems they&#x27;re trying to solve. Details beneath the abstraction <i>very</i> rarely bubble up from beneath to break things or otherwise demand attention, and nobody even pretends that when they do that it&#x27;s anything other than a problem.

It&#x27;s not <i>impossible</i> to produce these things. jQuery is one of my go-to examples: it did a great job of insulating developers from browser API differences and blew native APIs so far away in terms of convenience that people could mistake it for an application framework (or even a language).

If we think what is really best for Pimlico we shall find the thread of thought leads to the throne or the mystic and the arbitrary. It is not enough for a man to disapprove of Pimlico: in that case he will merely cut his throat or move to Chelsea. Nor, certainly, is it enough for a man to approve of Pimlico: for then it will remain Pimlico, which would be awful. The only way out of it seems to be for somebody to love Pimlico: to love it with a transcendental tie and without any earthly reason. If there arose a man who loved Pimlico, then Pimlico would rise into ivory towers and golden pinnacles; Pimlico would attire herself as a woman does when she is loved. For decoration is not given to hide horrible things: but to decorate things already adorable. A mother does not give her child a blue bow because he is so ugly without it. A lover does not give a girl a necklace to hide her neck. If men loved Pimlico as mothers love children, arbitrarily, because it is THEIRS, Pimlico in a year or two might be fairer than Florence. Some readers will say that this is a mere fantasy. I answer that this is the actual history of mankind. This, as a fact, is how cities did grow great. Go back to the darkest roots of civilization and you will find them knotted round some sacred stone or encircling some sacred well. People first paid honour to a spot and afterwards gained glory for it. Men did not love Rome because she was great. She was great because they had loved her.</i>",1434742242

Several clues: parallax, vergence, and focus. VR can simulate two of those.<p>So if you were looking at the images produced by the VR set up for a large screen far away vs a small screen close by, they would occupy the same number of pixels on the VR display, the same! It would be just as detailed. But in one case, the two eyes would show you the images from two different angles, whereas in the other, the images would be much more similar. This is the only <i>distance</i> we&#x27;re talking about, the perceptual distance created by the VR.<p>In all cases you&#x27;re looking at the same number of pixels a few centimers away from your eyes, but <i>perceptually</i> it can be made to appear as if watching a large screen at a distance or a small screen upclose.<p>If you still don&#x27;t understand, I can&#x27;t help you beyond that point.",1434741365

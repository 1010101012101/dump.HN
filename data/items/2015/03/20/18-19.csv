9239766,comment,9238839,9238839,0,0,freyr,,,"You have suggested that Silicon Valley is successful, in part, because workers accept a notion of &quot;long-term compensation&quot; [1]. Long-term compensation, perhaps better called maybe-someday compensation, requires SV software engineers to work for relatively less (factoring in cost-of-living) than many other skilled professionals, with hopes that they&#x27;ll be rewarded with a big windfall in the future.<p>With the rising cost of living in SF/SV, young engineers are expected to shoulder much the risk of startups while putting their long-term financial stability on the line. All in hopes of maybe-someday being compensated. And let&#x27;s face it, the lion&#x27;s share of these rewards will not be passed to these workers who put all their eggs in one basket, but to financially-secure VC&#x27;s who have hedged their risk across many companies. If this is how SV works, do you truly believe this is a strong foundation for the industry? Obviously it&#x27;s good for founders and VCs, but I&#x27;m considering the perspective of engineers.<p>We seem to be enjoying go-go years of investment and profits, everyone is starry eyed, and the system is working. What happens when the present-day strain on workers exceeds the allure of maybe-someday compensation? Also, why shouldn&#x27;t talented workers move to an industry that provides guaranteed compensation for hard work in real time?<p>Of course, start-ups have a much different risk profile than banks, consulting agencies, large corporations, etc. And as a result, the long-term compensation model may be a necessity. But in the end, it sounds like SV works because there&#x27;s a large supply of people willing to gamble on their future financial stability.<p>[1] <a href=""http://blog.samaltman.com/why-silicon-valley-works"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.samaltman.com/why-silicon-valley-works</a>",1426876915

Speaking as someone who majored in physics because I love the field even though I knew it wouldn&#x27;t help my comp sci career, Yudkowsky does not have the necessary background to speak with authority on this topic and it shows. He makes a few outright mistakes and a lot more overly broad statements, he ignores many validly competing alternative explanations, and as a result the grand philosophical conclusions reached are left unjustified (and as an editorial aside, probably bunk IMHO).<p>The important result of analyzing quantum mechanics as a case study in rationality is the valid point that if like most people (and sadly, most physics professors) you think quantum mechanics is weird, that should be very concerning. Quantum mechanics is <i>real</i>: it very accurately describes reality. If you have a problem with quantum mechanics, you have a problem with reality, and that&#x27;s about as anti-rationalist as you can get. To improve, find out what part of you rejects the reality of quantum mechanics in spite of experimental evidence, and censor that.<p>Once you&#x27;ve achieved that step, you can skip the rest IMHO.",1426875926

When you see an estimate of how a city’s built-up area has grown since 1980, or how the Everglades are changing, it probably has Landsat as one source. This explains a lot of design decisions that might seem weird to a layperson who wants to use it for everyday RGB imagery. Most use of Landsat imagery is basically off-label. It’s just <i>very good data</i> in terms of accuracy, precision, and general ease of use.

Rather than promoting the FSF&#x27;s agenda, I left with an even worse impression of it than I had originally had.<p>I give Stallman credit for his commitment to his cause, but at the same time I have to criticize him for maintaining his methods.<p>You want people to stop using Google Docs, because it&#x27;s proprietary and hordes your data under Google&#x27;s control? How about encouraging, spearheading, and promoting the creation of an open-source alternative? The suggestion of &#x27;Just don&#x27;t use Google Docs&#x27; isn&#x27;t practical; people use it for a reason, and he doesn&#x27;t seem to understand it, presumably because he doesn&#x27;t &#x27;collaborate&#x27; on documents the way that teams often have to. But if you put a free alternative in front of people, I&#x27;d wager you&#x27;d get a lot more converts.<p>Hell, how about just some modifications to OpenOffice to allow multi-user document edits using your native app, facilitated by a central server or peer-to-peer networking (e.g. zeroconf/avahi). Boom, now your full-featured word processor, which is <i>better</i> than Google Docs, has all the features you want, plus a local copy of the file.<p>Stallman&#x27;s arguments seem to be &#x27;This thing you like is bad, so just don&#x27;t have it&#x27;. It&#x27;s like someone without any children saying &quot;Why do you need a playpen? And so many toys? And baby gates? Just don&#x27;t let your kid go near the stairs, problem solved.&#x27; If you don&#x27;t understand the challenges involved, which he obviously does not, you can&#x27;t really provide input on the process.<p>He&#x27;s also generally opposed to Clang/LLVM, for the sole reason that it provides an even more freely-licensed replacement for GCC. Now don&#x27;t get me wrong, GCC is ridiculously important, and might be the most important thing the FSF has ever produced, but it also devolved into a complex, unmaintainable mess. Very few people in the world were capable of adding substantial features, and even fewer were willing to do so.<p>Now we have a competitor, an open-source compiler toolchain which provides better results faster than GCC, while also including tons of new features that makes a lot of work easier for everyone (e.g. integrating source code parsing into your IDE so you can find programming errors as easily as your spell checker can correct words). Clang/LLVM have forced the GCC team to sit up and start implementing all the things they had no time or interest to implement before. Now <i>everyone</i> gets a better compiler, no matter what OS you&#x27;re on or what you choose to use. GCC is a significantly better compiler, and Apple is largely to blame. But because Apple is involved, LLVM is bad, because it can be used in non-free build systems, like Apple&#x27;s or Adobe&#x27;s.<p>And yet, <i>despite</i> Apple&#x27;s use of it in non-free software, it&#x27;s still far better than GCC in a lot of ways. So his fundamental objection is that proprietary software exists and can be used, and not that it&#x27;s being forced on users. Apple and other corporations have advanced the state of computing and compiler technology, and he&#x27;s upset about it because of the very reasons these corporations were able and willing to put the money in to give us all something better.<p>I can&#x27;t take him seriously anymore. He&#x27;s been tenured for too long, and disconnected from users for so long. He has a lot to say about how the users of 1995 should use their computers, but nothing new since then.",1426875011

Suppose you had to choose between one person being tortured for 50 years, and a googol people being tortured for 49 years, 364 days, 23 hours, 59 minutes and 59 seconds.  You would choose one person being tortured for 50 years, I do presume; otherwise I give up on you.<p>>And similarly, if you had to choose between a googol people tortured for 49.9999999 years, and a googol-squared people being tortured for 49.9999998 years, you would pick the former.<p>>A googolplex is ten to the googolth power.  That&#x27;s a googol/100 factors of a googol.  So we can keep doing this, gradually - very gradually - diminishing the degree of discomfort, and multiplying by a factor of a googol each time, until we choose between a googolplex people getting a dust speck in their eye, and a googolplex/googol people getting two dust specks in their eye.<p>>If you find your preferences are circular here, that makes rather a mockery of moral grandstanding.  If you drive from San Jose to San Francisco to Oakland to San Jose, over and over again, you may have fun driving, but you aren&#x27;t going anywhere.  Maybe you think it a great display of virtue to choose for a googolplex people to get dust specks rather than one person being tortured.  But if you would also trade a googolplex people getting one dust speck for a googolplex/googol people getting two dust specks et cetera, you sure aren&#x27;t helping anyone.

If you prefer 10000000000000000000000000000000000 dust-specks over 1 tortures, then you should prefer to continuously blind someone with dust specks over taking a 0.0000000000000001% chance that they will torture someone.

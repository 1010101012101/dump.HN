I maintain that I absolutely work harder and am less distracted when I&#x27;m working from home, and by a pretty darn appreciable margin at that. If we&#x27;re only considering me in isolation then my opinion on the subject has not wavered. But over the past few years I&#x27;ve come to see the forest for the trees a bit more, and I&#x27;m realizing that while all the individual components of a distributed team might be higher-performing, the <i>overall</i> system wasn&#x27;t running very efficiently. A lot of time was lost to redundant efforts, efforts at cross purposes with each other, stuff like that.<p>I&#x27;m not prepared to throw the baby out with the bathwater - I still think there is a place for working from home and working remotely. But I&#x27;m also prepared to concede that it&#x27;s not all kittens and lollipops, and that there are valid reasons why a company might decide that co-location better suits its needs.<p>Full disclosure: I still ended up leaving my job over it. Among other reasons (none of which were really about the office itself), that daily commute would have eventually ground my sanity into nothingness.",1444359586

Anything missing?<p>There&#x27;s interesting issues to consider with respect to scale + locality in generation/storage.<p>My father-in-law&#x27;s partner has a property in a rural area. Their property runs on 100% solar. The surrounding area has no local (large scale) power generation. During a recent storm the whole town was knocked off the grid. The property with solar kept working (after the storm, not during) while town was without power for days.<p>It&#x27;s pretty rare to invest in small scale, local fossil fuel power generation. Small communities have to rely on the grid. But small scale renewable is feasible. There are cost benefits to larger systems, but those benefits need to be weighed up against the risk mitigation of having local systems.<p>The opposite side to that is that often the best places to run renewable generation is in remote areas and cities may be dependent on larger scale grids. (not that too many people want a fossil fuel plant operating in their city)<p>I expect that storage system (utility scale batteries) will shift the proposition again.

Facetime/Relationship building - If you&#x27;re seen more and have better relationships, on average, you will get tapped for better jobs/projects more often than people who are in another state/country. If you are the only remote worker on your team then you are at a serious disadvantage relative to your non-remote team members who see your boss every day.<p>2. Ease of communication - Working from home, for me, is frustrating because when I want to walk over to someone and ask them a question or set up a physical meeting ASAP I can&#x27;t. Phone calls and e-mails are great but there really is nothing like a physical meeting when it comes to hashing out problems on a white board or building a working relationship. This is also a negative because it can be very distracting to have people able to contact you any time you&#x27;re at the office, but for me it is a net gain.<p>3. I love people. I love working with them and getting to know them and having conversations with my coworkers. This is very easy to do when you are collocated. For me, working at home is lonely.<p>4. Knowledge synergies - This almost falls under number 2. It is really nice to bounce ideas off people without having to stare at a chat screen waiting for a response. I really enjoy when my coworkers ask me a question and a discussion ensues between all of us about the best way to do things. This is easier than waiting for someone to type a response or getting everyone on the phone.<p>Many of these things are possible to do over slack or meeting up once a week but it really does not beat being in the office every day.

Fast breeder. Pebble bed. I don&#x27;t care which you pick, no one is going to pour 10 years and $1-4 billion into a plant that won&#x27;t be cost competitive when it turns up (maybe some governments, but you can&#x27;t fix that; it&#x27;ll just get mothballed).<p>3.

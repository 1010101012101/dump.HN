The version of OpenSSL on my system is over 200 kLOC.  Do you really think that it's a ""pretty remote possibility"" that one of those 200k lines contains an exploitable buffer overflow?",1217635198

I'm building a game I'd like to play of the bus on the way to work.<p>I'm a big fan of the really slick side-scrolling shooters (think R-Type), but my biggest influence for this is my favourite Vic=20 game, Astroblitz. It's also a good excuse for me to get my pencils out and get some artwork happening - something else I used to love doing but haven't for years.<p>So, my motivation is pretty personal, and if it turns out anyone else likes my game too, that's a (quite nice) bonus.",1217634451

I'd tell that it was an Oak by the leaves. Who sees a Daddy-Long-Legs from beneath a glass panel? A normal view from above would make it obvious.

But that's quite extreme, in reality it's not anywhere near that bad.<p>I just don't agree with your risk/reward ratio of not using ssl.<p>It's: possibility of a bug in ssl that allows remote access to a machine, and is not expolitable without ssl (you have to agree that that a pretty remote possibility), vs the known problems of not having ssl especially in a wifi environment + the possibility someone will not understand you and not enable it even when he should.",1217634259

264612,comment,264511,264573,0,0,cperciva,,,"<i>That's about the same as saying that since plenty of people know how to pick locks don't bother locking your door.</i><p>Did you read the second half of the sentence I wrote?  You know, where I said ""unless they have a reason for needing it""?<p>I have a reason for locking the front door whenever I leave home, and I do so.  Putting a lock onto the back gate would be utterly pointless -- that gate is in the middle of a fence which would be easy for anyone to climb over -- so I don't do that.<p><i>Actually it's worse: there aren't any known ssl issues, so you're leaving your door unlocked just in case someone learns how to pick it in the future.</i><p>Replace ""door"" with ""back gate in the middle of a pointless fence"", and you'd almost be correct.  But security vulnerabilities in SSL stacks are not limited to breaking SSL; a buffer overflow could give an attacker far greater access.  A closer analogy to blindly using SSL everywhere would involve a special type of lock which, if picked, magically unlocks everything else on the property, including things like wall safes which are much harder to pick.",1217632928

252038,comment,251584,251983,0,0,timr,,,"<i>""why is the keyword 'virtual' even necessary? Surely all methods should be virtual by default (and the compiler ought to be able to replace virtual calls with direct calls based on the type information).""</i><p>And how is the compiler supposed to determine the (possibly dynamic) type of an object at compile time, in order to determine when to make the call statically?<p>If you declare a method virtual, you're <i>telling</i> the compiler to use late binding.  If you don't, you're <i>telling</i> the compiler to use early binding.  You always know what you're going to get.  That's why the keyword is there -- so you don't have to guess.<p><i>""Can anyone cite an example of where you'd actually want to call different methods depending on whether you're using a base or a derived pointer?""</i><p>Not sure what you're asking here.  Are you talking about the ability to hide a base class method with a derived class method?  It's not really considered a good idea to do such a thing (see: <a href=""http://www.parashift.com/c++-faq-lite/strange-inheritance.html#faq-23.8"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.parashift.com/c++-faq-lite/strange-inheritance.ht...</a>), but it's an inevitable consequence of mixing early- and late-binding features in the same language.",1216623150

The slow-typing/auto-complete was irritating until I realized why it was taking so long, and then I liked it for finding new music.<p>This is much better than Baidu's MP3 search.

252031,comment,252014,252014,0,0,JacobAldridge,,,"I checked out videomailz.com briefly - from what I can gather, you allow users to record their own video message via a webcam and send that (with a storage facility being planned). Now you want to include ads.<p>I can see two issues - not annoying the user with the type of ad you include, and determining context.<p>My guess is users don't want a pre-roll ad if they're sending a message (especially if it's a short message). Post roll ads need to be exciting very fast or they'll get ignored.<p>So your best bet may be a rolling text ad beneath the video message (but formatted so it looks like the CNN ticker, part of the screen without blocking the image, if that makes sense). Other, more subtle advertising means (like product placement) won't work because you don't have control of the recording.<p>2) Getting the context will be more difficult - unless you have the technology to analyze the video for keywords, you will need the user to give you information, which they may be reluctant to do.<p>I would suggest making some kind of tag mandatory when they send, and being honest about why you want that information - this is a free service, your vision is to improve the effectiveness of communication, and contextual advertising is the most profitable and least intrusive way to do so. The users who like your service won't mind.",1216622403

So to suggest that AS2's features are bolted on and AS3's aren't doesn't make much sense logically. Actually you've sort of implied that i am correct if you think about it. And why is it that AS3 conforming to the ECMA4 standard somehow gives it immunity to sucking?",1216621811

That's unsustainable.\nThey paid very little taxes and the government's debt ballooned to a point where the market said enough.\nGreece asked the EU for a bailout & they got it.\nThere were no real austerity measures.\nNow they want the debt holders to cut the debt in half.<p>Belgium's problems.\nBelgium's debt is ballooning out of proportion & bigger than Greece's.\nClose to 10% of the people work for the government.\nSavings are high and can be used to revive the economy.\nInstead, the government asked everyone to buy up their bonds at prices lower than what's available on the market. Crazy & stupid but real. \n50% of all goods are export, even though labour costs are twice as high as Spain's.\nThe Netherlands is in a similar situation. How is that possible? They just work harder.\nI don't know why that isn't mentioned in the article as a possible solution.<p>The Netherlands \nThey were able to handle the world economic slowdown that started in 08.\nThey came prepared, they paid down their debt with every surplus they had.\nExports have been holding up quite well, although the slowdown is catching up.\nSavings are high and that's another bullet you can use to revive the economy.\nHousing prices are a bit high though.\nAlso, those who work after age 62 can earn a bonus for every year they remain employed.<p>ECB & IMF\nThe ECB says they aren't allowed to buy government debt.\nThat's correct but it's BS as well. \nThey found a way around it. \nThey gave money to the IMF and the IMF gave it to Italy. With Germany & France's permission. \nLast week the IMF tried to raise money from its members. They failed at it.\nBoth the IMF & the ECB are sitting on gold reserves. \nNot enough to bail everyone out but perhaps enough for some quantitative easing.\nNot that I'm in favor of it. Quite the contrary.<p>Inflation\nWhen everyone wants a bailout and the ECB blows through all reserves, then they will have no other option than to do what Ben Bernanke is secretly doing in the US.\nHe's buying up all the debt and he's probably doing it by printing more dollars.<p>Don't worry, don't feel sorry, there're other solutions.<p>1) Governments need to be smaller & more efficient.<p>2) Lack of discipline & brass balls\n   In some EU countries you get paid $ 1,000 per month to take time off.\n   You get to ride on the bus for free. You don't have to pay taxes on your house.\n   The list goes on and on. It's a luxury problem. \n   It's easy to stop. It's political suicide but it has to stop.<p>3) Retirement age.\n   The worldwide average is 64 if I'm not mistaken.\n   In Europe it's something like 60 - 62.\n   In Germany it's 65 to 67, so they already shot that bullet.\n   It used to be 50 something in Greece ...<p>I'm all for austerity programs because I want the craziness to stop.\nI want our politicians to stop getting deeper in debt.

3383874,comment,3375806,3377535,2,0,intenex,,,"Alright, I'll speak for myself as that's the path I'm still walking and the one I know best. I'm 19, matriculated into Harvard for one semester, then dropped out and took on the Thiel Fellowship. Under the Thiel Fellowship, we're granted $100k (pegged around college ed prices) for two years to pursue an entrepreneurial project.<p>In the past year since leaving school, I've had more opportunity for maturity than I ever did in college. I've had the freedom to explore, and I've used that to travel to all 7 continents and broaden my internal horizons of the world. I've had the freedom to discover, and now I'm fortunate enough to have found a passion I can pursue with my full attention. I never had luxury of doing that in school - there's no time to step back and wonder why you're doing what you're doing as you're too busy being pushed through the grind of 'doing'.<p>I've had the freedom to become personally responsible. Being devoid of extrinsic pressures (must get good grades, build resume, get job, etc.) for the first time in my life means that I've had to replace those driving forces with intrinsic drive and accountability.<p>I've been living on my own in SF since June, and that's been a wild ride of being liable for every aspect of my own survival and well-being :). Being an entrepreneur means I have to account for a 24 hours each day on my own, as I don't even have an employer to provide a cover story for 8-9 hours every day. I'm not saying I account for all those hours nearly as well as I could and in fact I certainly don't (case in point), but this is offering me the opportunity to <i>learn to be accountable</i>, and that's exactly the point.<p>College is a pseudo-diverse atmosphere. Sure, people might be differently colored or have exotic accents, but everyone's there for the same purpose, is the same age, and has more or less the same mindset, or at the most one of a select few mindsets. Real diversity is living in a strange juxtaposition of homeless crackheads and billionaire tech entrepreneurs (woohoo San Francisco!), or seeing firsthand definitive proof that polio has in fact not been eradicated and is still alive and well in the marginalized corners of the world.<p>Even if we see these things in college, chances are likely our mindsets have been so tunnel-visioned that their full impact doesn't register on us. The insular bubble of college is pretty hard to penetrate.<p>Challenge-wise, being an entrepreneur is far harder than being a college student. And thanks to the cost of college, so many of us might never have the opportunity to take the entrepreneurial path (or any of a number of other paths) unless we take it in lieu of the college path.<p>And yes - college might very well be a mold that shapes you into the person you'll be, but it's a cookie-cutter mold, and it's not unique to you. Life is a variable endeavor, and the experiences we use as a mold with which to shape ourselves should similarly be variable. College is probably a wonderful mold for some. For others like myself, there are almost certainly better molds out there waiting for us to find them.",1324597383

3383871,comment,3380473,3381591,1,0,Tuna-Fish,,,"> Your suggestion that AMD used 16 ALUs per pipe under VLIW is wrong, The change is 4/5 VLIW ALUs to 16 ALUs that now can execute SIMD instructions.<p>Actually, the previous architecture was a setup of 16x simd, where each of the simd operations was a 5/4 wide vliw. So calling that 320 hardware threads is wrong -- in Cypress there really was only 20 front-ends which drove these bundles of 80 alus in groups of 5x16. Also, it was a 4-long barrel processor, so you had to schedule a SIMD ""wavefront"" of 64 ""threads"" for each unit.<p>In the new version each CU still has 4x16 ALUS like it had in Cayman, but now each of the 4 simd units of 16 elements can be scheduled independently by a different hardware thread.",1324597358

I've got some family in town for the holidays and have been tied up.<p>I stick to the advice in the article.  The one thing I didn't mention was that I only do these references if the potential employee is cool with it.  I ask the potential employee if I may check blind references and 95% of the time, they are cool with it...this happens toward the end of the process.  Sometimes when that employee is not leaving their current employer, they ask me to only reach out to folks from their previous employers which is totally cool w/ me.<p>Once I get the green light, I go through my LinkedIn and find folks who I know who have worked with the candidate -- Boston's a small town and I don't have to look too far.  I reach out and ask them about them.  I must say, I do ask some pretty ""open"" questions and leave the door wide open for someone to say something negative about the person because I don't feel like a get a full picture about the weaknesses from the ""given"" references.<p>I totally agree with those who say it is not cool to do this without the employees consent.<p>I'll give you a case where this worked.  Last month, we went through the interview process with someone from Microsoft.  The person did well on the interviews (I've noticed that humans are getting better and better at interviews over time) and it was time to do the blind refs.  The candidate was fine with us doing them.  In this case, they were already out of Microsoft.  I happen to know a bunch of folks at Microsoft.  I talked to them and they all said the same basic things and were all pretty negative.  We ended up passing.  Personally, I think we dodged a bullet there.<p>This method is one I learned from vc's.  In our venture rounds, I give them 5-6 references to call for me.  They usually call them, but spend the majority of their time calling mutual connections that I didn't provide.  Imho, this is smart!  ...There was one venture capitalist who I thought went a bit too far.  They called everyone they could find that had worked at HubSpot at one time, but no longer did.  That's not a long list, so all of those folks were calling me asking, ""Are you getting funded by ____.""",1324597171

All the 'hacker' could do is send the money to another PayPal account, which is trivially reversible as long as someone notices in less than 3-4 business days, before the receiving account can complete a withdrawal to a pre-confirmed bank account.<p>That's all assuming the account isn't immediately locked. If you log into a PayPal account from a different computer and far away location, they'll usually lock the account until you call in to say that's you and not a hacker doing so. At the end of the day, PayPal's core business is fraud detection, not payments. Anyone can do payments; they're just a software layer on top of two Wells Fargo and Chase merchant accounts.<p>Your PayPal account e-mail address should be considered public knowledge as soon as you put up a PayPal button. It's given out with every transaction and, if you don't use PayPal's encrypted button generator, it's in plain text in the payment form or URL.",1324597126

To do this they dictated terms to telcos on how they distribute iPhones, and broke long established conventions built up with Nokia, Motorola, Sony Erikson and others about the distribution process, and questioned the role of the telco in that process.

I think I remember $1-2 per user per year. That should actually be higher today, assuming in the ensuing years search engines have gotten better at monetizing traffic which seems reasonable.

However, doing so would reduce consumer demand, so that the aggregate demand for goods would drop. This would in turn reduce business sales revenues and expected profits. Investment in new plants and equipment—perhaps already discouraged by previous excesses—would then become more risky, less likely. Instead of raising business expectations, wage cuts could make matters much worse.<p>Further, if wages and prices were falling, people would start to expect them to fall. This could make the economy spiral downward as those who had money would simply wait as falling prices made it more valuable—rather than spending. As Irving Fisher argued in 1933, in his Debt-Deflation Theory of Great Depressions, deflation (falling prices) can make a depression deeper as falling prices and wages made pre-existing nominal debts more valuable in real terms.</i> [1]<p>To summarise, Keynesians generally believe that decreasing wages deceases aggregate demand, which discourages growth.<p>The general Keynesian to high unemployment during a recession is to increase government stimulus to increase aggregate demand.

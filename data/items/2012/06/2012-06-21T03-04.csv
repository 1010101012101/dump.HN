I like to stay entirely out of the tech blogs for privacy reasons, but at least a few HNers know of my companies.<p>With all due respect to those involved, these blog posts are usually just linkbait.<p>The young people I know running the 7 or 8 figure per annum companies like to keep the stories to themselves.<p>Last week, an old business friend of mine raised an 8 figure round for his already highly profitable B2B software business. At his age he can't even legally drink in the US. The tech bloggers would wet themselves with this story, but he has kept it entirely under wraps for a few reasons. The thing about it is - literally one day after he closed the round, he was back to all-day coding sessions. He always says that if you just have focus, you can have anything. And this is truly evidence to support that.<p>Don't worry about what bloggers write or what others are doing. Focus on building something of value, experiment, never quit, and in no time you'll be the one deciding whether or not you want the tech blogs to write about you, not the other way around.",1340251091

4140475,story,,,4,4,PythonDeveloper,"IPredict: Speed of light actually exceeded by 2015",,"Okay all you theoretical zealots, save your anger and your rage for someone else. You won't get my goat on this one.<p>It's widely accepted that c0, the speed of light in a vacuum, which has a refractive index of 1.0, is  299,792,458 meters per second (1).<p>The speed of light is widely seen as finite and the upper limit of any movement of anything with a positive rest mass. Most texts state with absolute conviction (something that is supposed to be unattainable in science) that even in experiments where the speed of light is exceeded, since the group velocity of the wave carries no information (wait, what?) it's not really occurring.<p>Science also assumes that a vacuum is the ultimate medium through which light can travel, which is why the speed of light (aka c0) is always quoted as measured in a vacuum.<p>I predict that by the end of 2015, subject to the end of the world later this year, experiments in superconductivity will show that light passing through a superconductive field having a refractive index of less than 1 will result in light exceeding c0, until that light encounters another field with a refractive index of 1 or more.<p>I also predict that we won't know what the hell to do with this, since CPU processing and memory access can't currently handle information at even c0 speeds, and passing information across the superconductive substrate at a refractive index of 0.9999999999 will cause a backlog of information at the CPU or memory controller, negating the benefit.<p>Nonetheless, the speed of light will be broken, causing either (a) the opening of scientific minds and the cessation of arbitrary unproven limits to fit mathematical models or, most likely, (b) the redirection and application of millions of man hours of the greatest minds in science to disprove this finding in order to preserve the status quo.<p>What say you?<p>References :

And not extend to just website design?<p>If anyone knows and can help, that'd be great.

Yes, we were hired as a studio audience for an evening.<p>This was clever because they gave us a reason, not just an individual reason but a collective reason, to be there. We felt more engaged with the experience, even when it dragged into the late evening. We actually ended up laughing, at jokes that were not that funny when they ended up on TV.<p>Ultimately, what they did to get us there enhanced the enjoyment of the later users... I mean viewers. I wouldn't hesitate to get early users the same way, for the same reason.<p>Getting people to sit in a seat in a studio and laugh for an evening is basically a solved problem. But getting a sharper-than-average, engaged group of early app or site users is still tough. And it's desperately needed.<p>As others mention, Mechanical Turk is a pretty bad fit. You're probably better off getting a few friends to be sockpuppets (be sure to pick less silly names than ""Nutshapio"" though).

At Chipotle's I can count on getting healthy fresh natural-tasting food fast, clean tables, and lots of good looking women among fellow customers. At McDonald's I increasingly experienced unhealthy stale, artificial/chemical-tasting food (sometimes fast, sometimes slow), with dirty tables, dirty drink stand areas, dirty bathrooms, sometimes no mirrors, flies common, and lots of fat or ugly women, and slobs of all genders/ages in general. And the price of a meal is roughly the same, order of magnitude-wise. And because of the indoor playground, more frequent cases of kid's screaming or being obnoxious -- though it sometimes happens at Chipotle too, just not as much. Oh and the music would be better at Chipotle too.<p>So it really became a no-brainer for me which to choose whenever I needed a fast meal and didn't want to make something. Chipotle isn't perfect (I've identified about 4 things they could do better, in my book) but they've come closer to perfect, in the fast food space, than any other business I've seen. I'm glad McDonald's is (hopefully) losing in the marketplace and on Wall Street, and Chipotle the opposite. It (should be) all about the customer and the end-user experience, and this should be reflected in revenue and stock price trends, in a fair system.<p>I've never expected their burgers to match their ads, but I do expect them to taste good, and not provide a disgusting dining room experience.

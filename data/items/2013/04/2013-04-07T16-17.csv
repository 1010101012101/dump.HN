5507788,comment,5507177,5507177,3,0,spartango,,,"I've been using <a href=""http://vertx.io"" rel=""nofollow"">http://vertx.io</a> pretty heavily in the last few months, and rather enjoying it. It's an asynchronous I/O framework that wraps the powerful NIO and Netty infrastructure with some elegant APIs and design patterns. It does a bunch of other things as well, but digging through the code, those are the concepts that will jump out at you.<p>Vert.x is a decidedly ""modern"" Java codebase; it's written in a decidedly different style from ""traditional"" enterprise Java. From the build tooling (Gradle) to the use of callbacks and delegation, you'll find it a bit refreshing. I'd recommend thinking about how you would use other patterns or structures in concert with Vert.x as well, as that will get you thinking about architectures. Exploring its model of concurrency in concert with Java concurrency tools is a must; some of my favorite Vert.x code mixes its reactor with Grand Central Dispatch-like threadpools and clever message passing.<p>I've really enjoyed working with Vert.x. It's not without warts, but I feel like the code I've written around it represents a great advance in my Java style.",1365353932

In embarrassingly parellel problems, it is often a matter of adding an OpenMP pragma before the for-loop. To give one example, in some machine learning code I wrote, it was simply a matter of replacing<p><pre><code>  for (int i = 0; i < static_cast<int>(contexts.size()); ++i)\n</code></pre>\nby:<p><pre><code>  #pragma omp parallel for\n  for (int i = 0; i < static_cast<int>(contexts.size()); ++i)\n</code></pre>\nObviously, you have to ensure that shared mutable variables are properly protected.

I have tried to emulate some of OpenMP's functionality in the par package:<p><a href=""http://github.com/danieldk/par"" rel=""nofollow"">http://github.com/danieldk/par</a><p>I think the more convincing argument is that many Python programmers will feel far more comfortable writing Go than C or C++.

Sort of like how Windows 7 was a service pack to Windows Vista.

This does <i>not</i> mean they measured the actual speed of the interaction. Instead, the point of this experiment is to lose a loophole in Bell test experiments: simply put, Bell experiments had previously proven that this seemingly-""non local"" (bear with me) state exists and preserves dntanglement over long distances. The loophole was that it previously wasn't possible to time the ecperiment well enough to make sure that the whole thing didn't occur in some unexpected, <i>subluminal</i> way. Now we know it couldn't have occurred by some sort of classical interaction between the entangled qubits.<p>So how fast is the interaction, really? Well, it turns out that if something moves even 0.0001% faster than light, we can always find a reference frame in which it moves a million times faster than light, or infinitely fast, or even in which it appears to move at some huge negative velocity: back in time. See ""tachyonic antitelephone"". In other words, once something is faster than light, it is, essentially, instantaneous.

I'm not sure if I'm a 10x rockstar, but I’m definitely not a 0.1x slacker. My career so far was pretty successful: I worked at a startup, small consultancy and a big-co. Six months ago I resigned from a well paid job at the big-co. I'm emotionally struggling since then. I was interviewed by three companies for what I'd consider my dream jobs, and got three rejections. That hurt.<p>In the meantime I did some opensource work. I have two aspiring github projects with growing communities. But I don't know how to capitalize on that. Friends suggest to do consulting around those projects, but I don't want that. I'm good at programming, not running a business. Additionally, I like being emotionally attached to the things I do and that rarely happens while doing consulting.<p>I'm not really sure what to do next. I tried asking about opportunities, but here's a problem - I don’t want to work for typical internet businesses like a web framework, analytics startup, or a newspaper publisher. I don’t feel enthusiastic about selling advertisements or stuff that’s purely virtual. I want to write good software, be productive and eventually save the world. I’d like the job to be meaningful. I guess I want to care about it.<p>The time's passing and I'm not making much progress in the job search. I'm getting depressed, which doesn't help with being enthusiastic about potential employers. I fear that my morale will deteriorate and I'll be stuck with neither a job nor an energy.<p>Dear HN. What should I do?<p>- Should I reduce my ambitions and take a first not-completely-stupid job and hope it’ll lead somewhere?<p>- How to be enthusiastic about companies I don’t know?<p>- How can I meet people who have the opposite problem: have passion and vision, but lack a decent engineer?<p>- What’s your experience? How did you find your dream job once you got rejected from places that you thought were the best?",1365350868

Add up malpractice insurance, medical billing, drug advertizing, insurance companies (more advertizing, administration, reviewing claims etc.), hospital overhead, and proft every step of the way. Overhead just dominates heal care spending which is why Canida has universal heathcare while spending less government money per person than the US.",1246371041

Just keep in mind that our opinions, while well-intentioned, come from our own experiences and as such will be what we would do in that situation. We aren't you and so take what we say with a grain of salt.<p>Third - The demo approach is best in this situation IMO.<p>Fourth - Why are you asking us? Your partner/friend should really be handling this side of it IMO. If you trust him/her to be your partner then you should trust that person's experience and suggestions.

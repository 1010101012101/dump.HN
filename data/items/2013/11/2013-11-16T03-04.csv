In order to grow, a replacements need to interoperate, ie. provide an &quot;upgrade path&quot;. Instead of holding something up as the one true solution we are betting on the trend, which is certain. Besides, cash will always be around.<p>Cryptocurrencies, despite their huge number and numerous attractive properties, presently lack market depth, limiting both their stability as value stores and feasibility as trade instruments outside of rapid/realtime/automated exchange. Significant issues with the dominant one (Bitcoin) make it difficult to implement securely, hard for non-technical users to properly understand or trust (there is no benevolent dictatorial regulator, as per their established national currencies/financial service providers), they require connectivity or blockchain storage which is unvailable in much of the world&#x27;s devices, and so on and so forth.<p>A parallel to your suggestion is the example of existing community currencies, which are essentially geographically bound equivalents of cryptocurrencies with an often more moralistic focus. I have been in contact with these groups and associations thereof, plus theorists in the area, and my understanding is that many face challenges in the same areas as Bitcoin; ie. new user education, balance of trade and interoperation with conventional established systems. Indeed, they are developing an inter-exchange protocol at present known as CXP.<p>As for your vast simplification, the best (from a moral standpoint) and hardest kind of change to reverse (from a potential opponent standpoint) is that which is is completely decentralized; an &#x27;opt-in&#x27; from the edge nodes.

Its probaly better for you to study the definition and history of the word than for HN to lectur you or try to enlighten you. In addition to the word &#x27;misogeny&#x27;, you might also do well to study the phrase &#x27;argument from ignorance&#x27;, which I referred to above. The logical construct &#x27;some of the worst&#x27; also seems to be mis-understood. Because there is a reasonably large number of people on HN that speak English as a second language there&#x27;s no point in continuing this sort of debate. Because ultimately, you seem to be basing your line of attack on false premises. I will, however, limit my remarks for brevity to the case of <i>misogeny in the western english speaking world</i>. (One could extend the argument, but its not neccessary to support my earlier point.).<p>(1) Definitions: <i>Misogyny is manifested in many different ways, from jokes to pornography to violence to the self-contempt women may be taught to feel toward their own bodies.&quot;</i><p>(2) Its clear from (1) That the media and workplace bullying are included in the definition.<p>(3) Its clear from the construct of &#x27;many of the worst&#x27;, that this refers to a non-trivial number, but need not be exclusive. So, the verbal threshold means &#x27;many but not neccessarily all, and in any event not amount we need to further specify or approximate in specific percentages&#x27;. But, for the sake of it. The data I reference earlier implied that despite the higher proportion of total &#x27;work bullies&#x27; in the workplace being men, a woman is <i>as likely to be bullied at work by a woman</i>. So, from the perspective of <i>women</i>, this is indeed a non-trivial amount. We can be reasonably say then that the &#x27;some of the worst&#x27; bullies are other women, because this makes up <i>half</i> of the pool.",1384573872

Pervasive GC certainly makes the language easier, with a performance cost that can be totally reasonable in many scenarios.<p>I do think that there are applications for which GC will always be slower than alternative systems such as arena allocation that Rust provides safe support for. (As an extreme example, the binary-trees shootout benchmark.) A language that does not provide safe manual memory management will lose in either performance or safety for these applications. I prefer not to make statements like &quot;GC is slower than manual memory management&quot;, since there are many applications for which this is not true (for example, the level generation benchmark).

He was convicted of burglary for stealing a wallet from a Myrtle Beach hotel room when he was 44 years old.

Police arrested him when he tried to use the stolen credit card at a pancake house.

At what point does society get to tell people &quot;you know what, knock it off&quot;?<p>> After serving two years in prison during his mid-twenties for inadvertently killing someone during a bar fight, Aaron Jones turned his life around. He earned an electrical technician degree, married, became an ordained reverend, and founded the Perfect Love Outreach Ministry. Years later, Aaron was hired to renovate a motel in Florida, and was living in an employee-sponsored apartment with two other workers, one of whom had a truck that was used as a company vehicle by all the co-workers. Jones decided to drive this truck home to Louisiana to visit his wife and four children. When Aaron&#x27;s co-worker woke up to find his truck missing, he reported it stolen. Aaron was pulled over by police while driving the truck.<p>I don&#x27;t understand this one at all.  Shouldn&#x27;t the truck owner have testified on his behalf?

6743415,comment,6731540,6731540,1,0,shawnreilly,,,"I think it starts with support/backing from stakeholders, perhaps the founders or someone in a position to dictate/enforce policy. Once the stakeholders are on board, then I think the next step is to decide if you want to implement a physical solution (aka Folder/Binder) or a digital solution (aka Software, or a Software related Process), or perhaps a combination of both. Each organization will be different, so the best choice(s) would likely depend on facilitating existing policy/process or existing practices/culture. For example, if there are remote workers, then a physical solution (aka Folder/Binder) might be a bad idea. Another example, if IT security is an afterthought, or the IT Infrastructure is not controlled/managed then a digital solution (aka Software based) might be a bad idea. It all depends on the situation/organization, so this will be a call that you need to make. In terms of managing the passwords, I would recommend a role based distribution on a need to know basis. In other words, if there is no reason for all the employees to know all the passwords, then do not give them all the passwords. Just give them the passwords they need to perform their job functions, and secure the passwords that they do not need elsewhere. Sometimes (especially in a startup or when the workforce is small), the lines between roles can be blurred, so your mileage may vary. But the general rule of thumb is the same; only give out what you need to give out at a minimum. I would also recommend setting and enforcing password policy. From my experience, the standard is 16+ characters, one upper, one lower, one special, one number, no words, no re-using, and it must be changed every 60-90 days. Many IT Systems allow you to set and enforce this via policy, for example in a Windows Environment you can set/enforce password policy via Active Directory. Another example, in a Unix/Linux Environment, you can use chage / passwd (or modify the shadow file directly, not recommended) and PAM. I would also recommend to audit frequently. I think the most important aspect of creating/enforcing policy is to let everyone know that it&#x27;s nothing personal. Properly implemented security practices can be a pain in the ass. But effective Security is essential to protecting your assets. Getting the workforce on board is key. In most scenarios, your weakest point is internal (weather it is realized/intentional or not).",1384571825

In real life, I have also lived in a whole lot of countries and thus have experienced the joys of attempting to get both business and personal accounts opened, even those wholly unrelated to Bitcoin, across many countries.<p>The current global situation is essentially an unspoken global monopoly on the world financial system that has been standing since at least the 1970s through the unholy triumvirate of SWIFT, ISO, and SIX Interbank Clearing. Credit cards are an adjunct to all this, essentially representing systematized usury and privacy loss as a requisite convenience, but they do not stand at the core. Western Union and so on are similarly edge case, but guilty.<p>If you are a country, you first need to be recognized by the UN in order to be recognized by the ISO. Then, you need to have your currency recognized. Finally, your central bank and national banking system need to play ball with SWIFT. If you refuse to play ball, then you don&#x27;t get connected (North Korea), or get disconnected (Iran).<p>What do we mean here by play ball? We mean agree to give the US all of the information about all of the international financial transactions that anyone within your entire economy either does or attempts to do that cross a border. If you are a small country, this essentially draws a very accurate picture of your above board international economy including key players, volume of trade, key supply chain links, etc. To put it simply, SWIFT is one of the US&#x27; most important global intelligence assets and despite the best efforts of Europe to rid itself of SWIFT-based surveillance, it has persisted in a complete fashion (100% of all transactions) since <i>at least</i> 2001 (source: FOIA response, European Data Protection Supervisor, <a href=""http://www.asktheeu.org/en/user/walter_stanish"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.asktheeu.org/en/user/walter_stanish</a>). (I would argue since <i>at least</i> the establishment of its first, hush-hush, &#x27;International Operations Center&#x27; in the questionable location of CIA-friendly Virginia, way back in the 70s. But I digress.)<p>Understanding that this is the general government and international relations level background, then, let&#x27;s now turn to the commercial. In order to actually create a bank account (&#x27;financial endpoint&#x27;), you basically need to be a bank. While there are often financial service provider (money transmission provider, or whatnot) categories that act as extremely limited alternatives, in reality any form of serious innovation does require being a bank. Unfortunately, to become a bank within a UN-recognized country and actually innovate, one must simultaneously face the wrath of both the entire established international system and the national government and industry of your home jurisdiction.<p>The solution which we are charting, is four pronged:<p>(1) to collaborate simultaneously with regulators across multiple jurisdictions such that a jurisdiction attempting to erect unfair barriers to innovation simply faces a direct loss of capital (as scaleup occurs);<p>(2) to establish forward looking financial settlement paradgims which empower the initiator to enable routing around specific assets or nations based upon their own priorities (&quot;ethical settlement&quot; as an adjunct to &quot;ethical business&quot;) while using arbitrary settlement systems or assets: <a href=""http://www.ifex-project.org/our-proposals/ifex"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ifex-project.org/our-proposals/ifex</a> ;<p>(3) to democratize the creation of individal financial endpoints (&#x27;bank accounts&#x27;) by embracing and extending the emerging dominant financial standard for such, the IBAN, to a nominally familiar and interoperable system that can be decentrally allocated through a neutral party (IANA): <a href=""http://www.ifex-project.org/our-proposals/iiban"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ifex-project.org/our-proposals/iiban</a><p>(4) To standardize the intersystem identification of non-ISO approved currencies (new release of this about to come out; ISO reformatted their source release so slightly delayed): <a href=""http://www.ifex-project.org/our-proposals/x-iso4217-a3"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ifex-project.org/our-proposals/x-iso4217-a3</a><p>Regulators as well as banks and a lot of private sector businesses can see clearly that massive paradigm change is coming within global finance. Nobody quite knows how it will play out, but there are numerous significant factors supporting a shakeup: (1) the rise of China and the CNY as a reserve currency (2) Chinese parallel settlement networks (3) India and Iran&#x27;s need to trade oil (4) cryptographic currencies (5) the increasingly globalized 24x7x365 nature of business (6) the inability of established banks to meaningfully innovate (is there even <i>one</i> globally with no downtime, where downtime includes evenings, weekends, holidays and scheduled systems maintenance?) ... we&#x27;re talking 365 - 52*2 (= 104 weekend days) - 10 public holidys = ~251 days per year of actual availability, in which 80% of services are unavailable for at least 1/2 the time (6pm-6am) ... a far cry from five nines.

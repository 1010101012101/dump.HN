The full set of DNA changes might be more precise in terms of really really pinpointing the right genes.  But, I guess the true power comes with correlating everybody and their phenotypes together, in which case it doesn't matter if you're looking at unexplainable SNPs or not.",1220943013

Surely they can pass some of that savings (from only having to test on one machine) on to me? :P",1220942444

You seem to be pretty misinformed about what we do.<p>* We indeed do conduct our own research and are currently collaborating with some prominent research institutions (Parkinson's institute).<p>* Why do we have to own sequencing equipment to be useful and/or legit?  Does Google own the webpages they index?<p>* We give you much more than a ""pretty writeup"".  This includes crowd-sourced research initiatives, ancestry and health communities, and many interactive ways of analyzing your own data.  A ton more things coming in the future.",1220941787

Not all compensation is in terms of pay.<p>A CEO to taking a lower compensation says to me they are taking the company seriously.  It's another way they have skin in the game.<p>If they aren't willing to sacrifice a little for the end game, may mean they are either purely in it for themselves or don't have confidence in the company.  Either one is not so good for the company.",1220941678

The software products are sold at a fair price and most of our customers expect to use the products for many years into the future - probably decades. Thus we provide free upgrades for all users.<p>It helps on the maintenance front as well. We can ""kill off"" support for very old versions by encouraging such users to move to a later one.<p>Some software sales models depend upon selling upgrades - alternately you price for ""lifetime use"" and enjoy a long term relationship with your customers.",1220941518

I truly thought that the markets were efficient, that any available knowledge about a company was already reflected in its stock price. Yet I saw Raleigh using the information I gave him to make money for his clients.</i><p>Heh, that's exactly what I'm experiencing now. I've always bought the efficient markets hypothesis (i.e., that current prices already factor in all available information). But, I've been meeting analysts who are supposedly experts in their respective fields, and I've come to a simple conclusion: they can't interpret the information they're given.<p>They are the kind of people who consider valuation by a constant multiple of eyeballs to be legitimate. They are the pointy-haired-bosses of the world, who read a few trade rags and think they are experts.<p>In one light, it's all rather depressing. In another, it seems like a great opportunity ;-)",1220941364

The myspace music playing is really good and I do think it should auto start after you click on an artist.

10104182,comment,10099304,10104112,0,0,hosh,,,"Unless they reinvent the old tech :-)<p>The image-based environment throws me off, but it&#x27;s being reinvented in a different way: Docker container images.<p>I&#x27;m not really thinking about popularity as a general platform like the way a lot of people use say, Java. I&#x27;m thinking about a niche area that is still relatively obscure, will be popular in the future, and very few other technology platform will fit it well.<p>I think a lot of people will try to throw Javascript as the scripting language for the building VR worlds. It might be workable, but the mindshare for creating VR content is still up for grabs.<p>The biggest obstacles I think will be in two areas:<p>(1) An equivalent Github / Open Source thing. Open Source did not really take off until Github and it&#x27;s sibling clones got popular. That property was written extensively by Stephen O&#x27;Grady of Redmonk -- git and Github made things easy to fork and easy to merge, which reduces the friction of having the community contribute things back. I&#x27;m not necessarily saying to implement Github for SmallTalk, because that would not bring the uniqueness of SmallTalk in. But for example, I can dip into Github and check out what the Python or Lua community are doing. Montecello baffled me until I realized that you&#x27;re not supposed to interface it with the web, you&#x27;re supposed to interface it from inside the SmallTalk environment. This leads to the psychological shadow-side of what makes SmallTalk awesome.<p>(2) The all-inclusive environment of SmallTalk shares a similar attitude that long-time Lispers have with their environment, particularly Emacs. This is more of a psychological thing. At the minimum, there&#x27;s likely not as big of a push in creating the tools mentioned in (1). This is the psychological shadow-side of having a very comfortable environment that you can customize to you. There&#x27;s always going to be some sort of emotional resistance to bringing new stuff in there. Montecello is a great example: the web is kinda the lingua franca of exchanging ideas, so if it&#x27;s not on there, it&#x27;s hard to see. I go looking at the Montecello repositories via the web browser, and that experience was broken. It took me a while to realize I was supposed to browse that stuff from inside a SmallTalk environment. (So just off the top of my head: one idea is say, use that Squeak -> Javascript to host an image so you can browse into the SmallTalk world; preset it with Montecello. Just as a starting point.)<p>I&#x27;ve only looked at the community on the surface, but I&#x27;m willing to bet that the Pharo folks are making changes in there.<p>For me, SmallTalk is a really important technology, not for the world as a whole, but for kids. I usually think of my step-daughter as the yard stick: what would I want to show her about this world? I&#x27;m not intending her to make a living off of SmallTalk, but something better, more important: this idea that she can remake her environment by first conceiving and envisioning, and then clearly expressing her intent. That&#x27;s a skill she can take into any domain.<p>But yeah something like: run around in a voxel engine like Minecraft, and being able to edit any voxel block in front of you to do something, or even add completely new behaviors. And sharing that with your friends. While using an Oculus Rift. Something along those lines.",1440285931

If you can&#x27;t do that (whatever the reason), you won&#x27;t feel happy at work.<p>Now of course, in a capitalist corporate setting there are a lot of reasons why you may not be able to align your motives to that of the CEO, for obvious and less obvious reasons.  Books are written about that.<p>See for example:<p>- Capitalisme, désir et servitude (2010) Frédéric Lordon<p>- L&#x27;être contre l&#x27;avoir (2012) Francis Cousin<p>Essentially, corporations are there to make money for the C*O and for the shareholders.  Anything else is purely accidental and out of their real scope.  This can indeed leave a sense of void.<p>You may try to find a corporation that has a real purpose, like, put a colony on Mars, or develop fusion energy.  But as soon as they start to show sign of success, they&#x27;re eaten by capitalists that then change their purpose.  A very good example of that is Apple, which started to become successful with the Macintosh, and then the capitalists took over, fired Steve Jobs, and lead Apple to the catastroph with eventually a capitalization of -400M, when NeXTcomputer Inc took it back. But since then nothing happened at Apple, but the accumulation of capital: all you&#x27;re sold today has been developped at the early Apply Computer Inc. from Xerox PARC stuff and at NeXTcomputer Inc from stuff invented at various other places (Avi Tevanian invented Mach at Carnegie Mellon University,  Brad Cox and Tom Love invented Objective C at their company Stepstone Inc, and Bernard Hulo invented Interface Builder (written in ExpertLisp) while at the INRIA).<p>There are almost no capitalist corporation where you can have a real purpose, and invent or develop new stuff, by necessity, because use of money as final decision maker. Cf. &quot;law of averages&quot; in  Ainsi marchait l&#x27;humanité, Jean-François Geneste.<p>And the situation is rather hopeless, given the current state of academia and academic research too.<p>You might think that you can just work for the money, and then create happiness at home working on your own projects.  But you would subestimate the soulsuckingness of corporations.  Realize that you are much poorer than your grand parents or great grand parents: they had a land to cultivate and to live on.  You probably don&#x27;t.  Before the industrial &quot;revolution&quot; and before the capitalists forbid people to use the communal terrains for their food production, people lived well working much less than now.  We&#x27;ve been robben of our means of survival, and forced to work as slave in corporations.  You need to find a way to free yourself from this system, and this means, you need to re-acquire the autonomous means to your survival; land, culture, livestock.  Buy some cheap place with a garden to grow your own food.

(Which I&#x27;d argue constitutes a large portion of truck-based freight)<p>How much longer does it take to load/unload a freight train versus a truck? How much slower is the train and how longer does it take to ship? (and how does that affect cost or product quality when shipping items that must be refrigerated in transit?) Is it a realistic option for same-day or overnight shipping required for services like Amazon Prime in the volume that is currently being carried by trucks?<p>For items where delivery is not urgent, I&#x27;m all for using rail, but with expectations from consumers for quick delivery, its hard to see how they will be able to compete on the current system for rail-based freight.<p>An alternative (at least in the short-term), might be to create truck-only traffic lanes or highways with tolls and fewer exits. (and other lanes or highways just for cars) The lanes could be built to withstand the additional weight from the trucks, and non-truck traffic would run more efficiently and safely.",1440284609

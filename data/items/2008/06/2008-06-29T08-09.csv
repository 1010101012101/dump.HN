My apologies for jumping to conclusions in my first response.<p>Personally, I probably wouldn't have had the balls to raise as much dust as you did, but ideally, why didn't you warn the leaders of the organization that unless the issues were resolved internally, you'd be providing evidence of misconduct to the media at such-and-such a date, giving them time to prepare whatever PR kung-fu organizations do during scandals?<p>To me it just seems really immoral to walk away when taxpayer money is involved...",1214729100

231096,comment,231036,231089,0,0,bayareaguy,,,"Thanks.  I remember your earlier article where you wrote<p><i>Third, if you have an item with only one attribute, and your read:write ratio is more than 22:1, it's cheaper to use S3 instead of SimpleDB -- even ignoring the storage cost -- since S3's 1 μ$ per GET is cheaper than SimpleDB's 1.305 μ$ per GetAttributes request.</i><p>and wondered if that still held true for varying I/O rates.",1214727841

Maybe a sovereign wealth fund? Unless those funds stay away from Web 2.0.<p>Beyond that, yes, they'll have to show revenue. Facebook will be a good test of the ultimate stability of the Web 2.0 Bubble. I think their best strategy is to go into the mortgage market, but the consensus of this board seems to be that Facebook won't succeed in the mortgage market.",1214727668

Use ""his/her"" when it is known, and a whole new sentence when it isn't.<p>""Pat Jones has has been tagged in a photo"" or something similar. That removes the aspect of it being done by themselves though.",1214727496

I considered it for the application I intend to use SimpleDB for, and decided that SimpleDB was far cheaper.<p><i>I'm still curious about the values you're using in your test.</i><p>They were utterly synthetic -- the first things which came to mind: The item names were 0000, 0001, 0002, ... 9999, the attribute names were ""square"" and ""cube"", and I think you can guess what the attribute values were. :-)",1214727194

You can mutilate it to such an amazing degree and still make sense of it.<p>I'm not sure if this is true for other languages, since English is the only one I am fluent in. Maybe you can just remove ""English"" from my comment and make the point ""language is flexible.""",1214727020

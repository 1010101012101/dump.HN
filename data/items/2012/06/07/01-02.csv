How is that different from the regular system, other than you're using SQLAlchemy rather than Django's ORM?<p>I'm also finding it hard to think of a use case where you need to authenticate 100 users at once, so your initial rationale (100 separate updates) doesn't really work. Surely you'd use a different tool to populate your database, but Django's ORM for day to day stuff?",1339034311

He ignored my warnings.<p>He lasted six weeks before changing majors. It really messed him up psychologically - he's got a serious inferiority complex now.

Fancy data structures are one thing when you want the population of California, another when you're trying to get California, by ethnicity and age group, by zip code.<p>- Data structure compactness will matter less to HN readers than to someone sitting on the other end of a phone dial-up in Oklahoma.<p>- I am but an egg but don't fancier data structures require particular decisions for implementation on particular tables?  Census has a lot of tables -> a lot of decisions.<p>- God only knows how many different systems are involved holding all their data.  The simpler the data structure, the less they have to get into those -- and / or the simpler a layer they between some mainframe and the API output.<p>Also, it may not seem very friendly to HN readers.  But it is stupid simple, you can _see_ how it is organized, making it accessible to a wider audience.  And it's so simple that it can be adopted by any agency publishing tables.  Note that there are a lot of agencies with a lot of tables -- something like this has a chance of becoming standard among all of them.<p>A public agency has special accessibility concerns, and it's just a reality that government agencies have particular legacy technology issues.  A lowest common denominator format helps get the data over those obstacles.<p>Maybe they can do better in places, and they're free to, there is no reason they can't support other formats too.  But this will be available for whatever subset isn't served by those extensions.",1339034214

And while it may be in some sense targeted to fill the Django space, at the present time (and certainly at the time I worked in it) it was more like Flask and a couple of things lightly tacked on.<p>No, my main point is that Django is what Django is, and while that may not be perfect, it isn't useless, it doesn't ""suck"", it just doesn't meet all needs any more than anything else does. Flask doesn't meet all needs either. Don't complain that water is tasteless when what you wanted was mustard. Being tasteless doesn't make the water suck, it just makes it water. Complaining about its watery nature is just silly.<p>If Django <i>actually</i> sucked I'd probably not have said anything, but it's more successful at actually bringing together all those things than most of its competition.

So when you lose a drive, if the only content you have is on that drive you need to seamlessly switch from sucking it off the drive and sucking it down the back haul network. I can think of a number of ways [1] that might be done with varying degrees of 'hiccup' on the user end, but it is a big chunk of cache to lose at once. Note that 3TB is also 50 minutes of full on 10 GbE pipe bandwidth. But as you say it isn't as if you <i>lose</i> data, since its still there back at the head office, but you lose that copy of it.<p>[1] Ways that come to mind are; multiple boxes with a diversity of the content amongst them so that another box can 'pick up' the stream, keeping a stream to the home office open but not pulling data until you lose the local source, or even doing a 'buffer' to disk and stream from the buffer then switch disk targets when your disk fails.",1339033945

It's not so much the cross-platform targeting that interests me, but the ability to use the tools I already know and enjoy (e.g. Backbone.js). Furthermore, the ability to use a language designed for presentation only (CSS3) is a great improvement in terms of separation of concerns. The author is also spot on about the value of not having to spend time studying native APIs in depth.<p>He's also absolutely right about results equalling effort. I've seen plenty of terrible mobile apps developed in JS, and I also have yet to see a jQuery Mobile app that feels right to me. I think some of this stems from attempting to recreate stock native UI elements and failing halfway. I wasn't interested in doing so with ChainCal, so I avoided that issue altogether.<p>As for performance, JS execution has never really been a bottleneck -- it's DOM manipulation. My advice would concur with the author's: use CSS transitions for everything. If you put in the time with benchmarking small operations and you approach things in different ways to squeeze out performance, your app can feel native. Trial and error led me to plenty of performance discoveries. As an example, using translate3d to move an element offscreen is tremendously faster than setting its display to 'none'.<p>Finally, I will agree about jQuery being a very large library with a lot of cross-browser support that isn't necessary for mobile. However, from my benchmarking, it would seem jQuery is still faster at most DOM operations than Zepto.<p>Happy to answer any questions about my experience with PhoneGap.",1339033828

If you shoved all this data into a giant database, query speed is still under a few milliseconds.  In general, rainbow tables can be sharded fairly easily, so if your data set is a few hundred terabytes, just split it across a few machines and you'll retain the millisecond query times.  Storing and querying easily partitioned data will usually be faster than a brute force calculation.<p>Calculating it is like saying you want to find the fibonacci number for any given N, and you have a really fast processor to calculate it to that N, but if you just persisted pre-calculated values up to C, you'd only need to calculate N-C hashes.  So even if you are bruteforcing the password, it is still faster to have rainbow tables up to a certain length.",1339033039

To be blunt (because there isnt any\n    nice way to put this) we think Big Entertainment is largely run by liars and\n    thieves who systematically rip off the artists they claim to be protecting\n    with their DRM, then sue their own customers because theyre too stupid to\n    devise an honest way to make money.\n\n    Im sure you dont agree with this judgment, but you need to understand how\n    widespread it is among technologists in order to get why all those claims\n    about piracy and lost revenues find us so unsympathetic. Its bad enough\n    that we feel like our Internet and our computers are under attack, but having\n    laws like SOPA/PIPA/ACTA pushed at us on behalf of a special-interest group we\n    consider no better than gangsters and dimwits makes it much worse.\n\n    Some of us think the gangsters behavior actually justifies piracy. Most of us\n    dont agree that those two wrongs add up to a right, but I can tell you this:\n    if you make the technologists choose between the big-media gangsters and the\n    content pirates, effectively all of us will side with the content pirates as\n    the lesser of the two evils. Because maybe both sides are stealing on a vast\n    scale, but only one of them doesnt want to screw with our Internet or cripple\n    our computers.\n\n    Wed really prefer to oppose both groups, though. Our sympathies in this mess\n    are with the artists being ripped off by both sides.\n</code></pre>\nNote that the Rails Tutorial is neither part of Hollywood nor part of the music industry. It is distributed as DRM-free files that don't restrict your freedom in any way. When you make a purchase at railstutorial.org, the proceeds go directly to the ""artist"" (which in this case happens to be me).<p>As the author of the tutorial, I would of course rather you obtain the files legally.

Tenement homes/boarding houses get worn down quite a bit faster than rentals. It's easy to end up with the property completely trashed, it's easier to get sued or otherwise in trouble, and it's easy to end up with neighbors complaining and disliking you.<p>In addition to all of that, often codes simply don't allow boarding houses, regardless of who is running them. One of our renters tried to run a boarding house without our knowledge, and when the police were called to one of their parties, the city threatened to levy considerable fines against us for running a boarding house, regardless of whether we were actually running it or getting any money from the tenants.",1339031678

4077064,comment,4074105,4074629,5,0,rayiner,,,"The problem is that it's hard to tell when value arises from the elimination of a deadweight loss and when it arises from externalization of costs. E.g. environmental regulation generates some deadweight loss in the form of compliance, etc. It also seeks to internalize inherent costs of activity that would otherwise be externalized. If we got rid of the regulation, a factory owner would see a small amount of benefit from the elimination of the deadweight loss, and a very large amount of benefit from being able to externalize the inherent environmental costs of operating a factory on the local community.<p>In the situation of AirBnB, the externalities are imposed on all the other residents of the building and the neighborhood who signed up for apartment leases on the assumption that random people would not be coming and going. The value that accrues to the AirBnB host is generated partially by the loss of value to his neighbors.

You're leaking information about the password hash to the attacker, which they can use to speed up an attack where they have large offline resources but are limited in their online guessing capacity.<p>Let's e.g. assume we have an unsalted hash, but the system limits us to one guess per second. The password is hashed, then compared with ==, taking some variable time we'll assume can be measured.<p>We use an iterated timing attack to discover a prefix of the password hash, then run an offline dictionary or brute force attack using that prefix. Passwords that match the known part of the hash are tried online, potentially revealing more of the hash as we go.<p>> It feels sometimes like people hear about the idea of timing attacks and then want to see them everywhere.<p>When it comes to side channel attacks, ""vulnerable"" is the default state.",1339031219

Some day, I will end up having to take part a Macbook and repair it. Invariably, a screw will be lost, but it won't be a problem because there are two spares!",1196449141

I don't get what this article has to do with early-stage investments in particular, except that early-stage usually means <i>no income yet</i>.  <p>I guess investing only in proven businesses is a lot safer, but every business was ""early-stage"" at one point.",1196448933

85073,comment,84599,84909,0,0,downer,,,"URLs aren't a big deal.  Most people bookmark anyway, they don't type them in.  I mean are we going to complain about the character set for domain names next?<p>I surf sites that are natively in other languages and seeing words in URLs that aren't in English doesn't bother me.  It reminds me the world is a big place :)<p>> Every string displayed in your site (aside from the user created stuff) now becomes a bundle of strings, one for each language.<p>That's good practice anyway, from the standpoint of being able to make changes without touching the code.<p>> Hassle.<p><i>Web development</i> is a hassle in the first place.  But being able to handle other languages isn't any more complex than separating presentation from code.

85071,comment,85004,85004,0,0,oditogre,,,"This is so true - you see this kind of thing constantly where somebody has inadvertently changed the way something looks and are suddenly lost. I think one of the defining characteristics of a good IT guy is knowing a bunch of different ways to do the same thing on the software their organization uses (be it the OS or the word processor or whatever).",1196448550

85066,comment,84976,84976,0,0,mxh,,,"""... detailing a grim, overcrowded future ...""<p>This is one of my pet peeves.  BR's future isn't particularly overcrowded; J. F. Sebastian has the whole damn Bradbury building to himself.  As he says: ""there's plenty of space for everyone"".<p>The L.A. of BR is a dense urban environment, but, if anything, it feels like a city being slowly abandoned, not overcrowded.<p>I suspect the hotkeys for 'overcrowded' and 'dystopian' are just close to each other.  Anyway.  I'm sure y'all have some LALR grammars to discuss, or something.

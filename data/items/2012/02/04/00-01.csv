3549814,comment,3549384,3549560,7,0,imcqueen,,,"complete agreement with this. you eventually get used to the pay increase and the reasons for wanting to leave remain. Your manager no longer feels compassion for rewarding your hard work with promotions, bonuses and awards. Long term they're definitely figuring out a way to make you less crucial.<p>This generally only goes for quitting though. Simply asking for more money is completely different. the article focuses on employees quitting for leverage. If you work hard day to day and plant the seed that you're unhappy with your compensation (and continue to grind) a good manager should step in and reward you or guide you toward a promotion. The benefit just takes a lot longer than the ""pay up or I quit"" approach.",1328317174

Repo is not meant to replace Git, only to make \n  it easier to work with Git in the context of Android. The \n  repo command is an executable Python script that you can \n  put anywhere in your path. In working with the Android \n  source files, you will use Repo for across-network \n  operations. For example, with a single Repo command you \n  can download files from multiple repositories into your \n  local working directory.\n</code></pre>\n<a href=""http://google-opensource.blogspot.com/2008/11/gerrit-and-repo-android-source.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://google-opensource.blogspot.com/2008/11/gerrit-and-rep...</a><p><pre><code>  With approximately 8.5 million lines of code (not \n  including things like the Linux Kernel!), keeping this all \n  in one git tree would've been problematic for a few reasons:\n\n  * We want to delineate access control based on location in the tree.\n  * We want to be able to make some components replaceable at a later date.\n  * We needed trivial overlays for OEMs and other projects who either aren't ready or aren't able to embrace open source.\n  * We don't want our most technical people to spend their time as patch monkeys.\n\n  The repo tool uses an XML-based manifest file describing \n  where the upstream repositories are, and how to merge them \n  into a single working checkout. repo will recurse across \n  all the git subtrees and handle uploads, pulls, and other \n  needed items. repo has built-in knowledge of topic \n  branches and makes working with them an essential part of \n  the workflow.\n</code></pre>\nLooks like it's worth taking a serious look at this repo script, as it's been used in production for Android.

3549679,comment,3548824,3548824,95,0,bos,,,"Facebook engineer here, working on this problem with Joshua.<p>What this comes down to is that git uses a lot of essentially O(n) data structures, and when n gets big, that can be painful.<p>A few examples:<p>* There's no secondary index from file or path name to commit hash.  This is what slows down operations like ""git blame"": they have to search every commit to see if it touched a file.<p>* Since git uses lstat to see if files have been changed, the sheer number of system calls on a large filesystem becomes an issue. If the dentry and inode caches aren't warm, you spend a ton of time waiting on disk I/O.<p>An inotify daemon could help, but it's not perfect: it needs a long time to warm up in the case of a reboot or crash. Also, inotify is an incredibly tricky interface to use efficiently and reliably. (I wrote the inotify support in Mercurial, FWIW.)<p>* The index is also a performance problem. On a big repo, it's 100MB+ in size (hence expensive to read), <i>and</i> the whole thing is rewritten from scratch any time it needs to be touched (e.g. a single file's stat entry goes stale).<p>None of these problems is insurmountable, but neither is any of them amenable to an easy solution. (And no, ""split up the tree"" is not an easy solution.)",1328314069

We chat about what we did last 24, and what we want to do next 24, and if there are any issues we need help with. Helps to iron out any road blocks. I was really hesitant as first, and I think the group as a whole looked down on the idea, but it had really turned things around, and we are working much better as a team. Occasionally we go off on tangents, but it's nice to know what people are working on, and keeps people from slacking off when you're waiting for something.",1328314059

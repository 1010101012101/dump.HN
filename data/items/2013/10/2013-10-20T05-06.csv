6579056,comment,6564725,6575358,1,0,rofl,,,"&quot;That other comment was supposed to be tongue-in-cheek :)&quot; I somehow failed to comprehend your humor. But, from above comment, it seems I was not incorrect in detecting your stance about PHP.<p>In your article &quot;fractal of bad design&quot;, you have listed problems in PHP. You can get a lot of similar articles, from Google, that list problems in other languages.<p>PHP (or any other language for that matter) doesn&#x27;t do disservice to anyone or any community. None is forcing you to use PHP. If PHP doesn&#x27;t work for you, you are free to find another language that works for you.<p>Every language has caveats. But good news is - there are a lot people trying to improve the languages.<p>You are <i>trying to find</i> a solution like mod_php. But PHP community <i>has</i> that solution already. So, PHP has something right, right? It is always good when you try to do something to make the language of your choice better than talking bad about a language you dislike. Good that you are trying something to make something better.<p>Phone cameras have improved. So has PHP. PHP 5 is better than PHP 4. But if you expect PHP to have all features of Python, then it will become Python. PHP doesn&#x27;t want to become Python or Java or Ruby. And that is the most important part. PHP is popular because <i>the way it is</i>. It is not the most well designed language in the world. It never intends to have all features taught in <i>programming languages</i> class. Unlike Java, it never tries to be everywhere. PHP just makes it easy to create dynamic web pages. It will not force you to use OOP. It will not force you to use Camel case. It will not force you create XML config files. It will not force you to set type of variables. In short it gives you a lot of freedom and power. But, with freedom and power, comes responsibility. As a developer it is your responsibility to use OOP when needed. It is your responsibility to use right coding style.<p>Just imagine a world where you can&#x27;t choose anything. The computer store forces you to buy a Macbook, even though you can&#x27;t afford one, because the store believes that is the right tool for you. You got to university and the university forces you to take courses they think right for you. You go for buying holiday package and the travel company forces you to choose your destination because they know, based on their experience, what is right for you. Such world <i>without options</i> will be terrible.<p><i>So, let the craftsperson choose what works best for his or her work. Don&#x27;t force anyone to use anything just because you think that is right for them.</i><p>If you love Python, you can tell people why you love that language and how using that labguage makes programming fun. After listening to you, people can try Python. If they like the language, they will keep using the language. But going to a PHP thread and then writing limitations about the language or writing bad things about the community is nothing but <i>negative</i> criticism which is bad for everyone.",1382248421

He described to me that it was a multi step sale.<p>Now, I had read a blog post by Robert Cringely that talked about how companies steal corporations by devaluing stock after the initial sale so that sellers miss out on most of the money they were planning on getting. I had read it maybe a few months prior and was sketchy on the details but bells and whistles were going off in my head.<p>I told him he should read this blog post, I&#x27;d go find it and send it right over. Then the most amazing thing happened.<p>I want to point out, this was the best job I&#x27;d ever had. He was, by far, the best boss I&#x27;d ever had. Unlike any other person I had ever worked for he gave me a lot of autonomy and I made him a lot of money in a very short time.<p>So I was kind of surprised. Rather than say, &quot;hey, send it over&quot;, he instead began to explain to me that there was a contract, that they couldn&#x27;t change the contract after the fact, etc. I said ok, that I didn&#x27;t really recall the details in the article, maybe he should read it.<p>That&#x27;s when he said no. I was very surprised and disappointed but it only lasted a minute. I&#x27;m a type A personality so I sent it to him anyway.<p>Much later I learned that they had agreed on three equal payments in the millions. The first payment was paid as agreed. The next was a couple hundred thousand. The last was zero.<p>The formula was in the contract and couldn&#x27;t be changed. In fact, the purchasers only had control over one number in the formula. If you aren&#x27;t strong in algebra let me just tell you outright what that means.<p>The purchasers had total control over the formula.<p>My boss had a great lawyer that didn&#x27;t realize this or tell him. Maybe because he only gets paid if the deal happens.<p>They had a highly paid business broker who surely knew this but didn&#x27;t say anything because he only gets paid if the deal happens.<p>Anyway, probably my worst business day ever since I obviously caused my boss to lose way more than I ever benefitted him.

6578999,comment,6577671,6577671,6,0,mdxn,,,"I would advise that everyone take more care when assessing the Turing Completeness various models of computation. Many analyses that I have seen do a check for logical completeness, but forget to rigorously check that you have scalable and fully accessible memory, even in the most generalized cases. Even if you assume that some resource is unbounded, your other mechanics might not actually allow you to interface with it, even if they do work on a constant/small scale (locality of computation does not necessarily imply this). You could take a turing machine its infinite tape, but forget to show that you can move it left or right an arbitrary number of times. On the flip side, another ridiculous assumption involves including the power of human operation. Yes, an abacus is &quot;Turing Complete&quot; if it is infinitely large and you, as a human being, do the logic in your head. Pen and paper is Turing Complete by the same reasoning (this is ridiculous). Yes, we know that humans are capable of computation. I might grant that you have scalable memory in these situations, but where&#x27;s the automation of your logic?<p>Here&#x27;s an example of the first: I suspect that the in-game mechanics of a generalized version of Minecraft to not be Turing Complete. By generalized, I mean that you remove the chunk loading and update limitations, giving you a countably large playing field. I, of course, am not considering limitations (or benefits) of Java, the machine running it, or unintended behavior (bizarre bugs). Forgo things like command blocks and bizarre uses of spawn eggs/entities, just consider legitimately obtainable resources (we can assess TC with these later).<p>To briefly sketch the idea, when you have a constant sized machine (accessing arbitrarily sized input), the selected mechanics are too limited by construction to &quot;grow&quot; the equivalent to a Turing Machine&#x27;s work tape. A superficial reason for this is because the mechanics are coded to only extend locally (note that this is distinct from the &quot;computation is local&quot; result). For example, using pistons to push only goes out 11 blocks before it fails. You can chain multiple of these together, but only a constant number. You also need controllable Redstone signal to extend far enough to change their states. With a bit more work, you can show that mechanical self propulsion using pistons is not possible (there&#x27;s a giant thread on Minecraft Forums concerning this), even in one direction. Three simple reasons for this: 1. You cannot push extended pistons, 2. you cannot push/pull/power your back most piston without &quot;leaking&quot; blocks, and 3. you cannot make a pushable clock. Your ability to shift around and access your tape/memory or move your Turing &quot;head&quot;/logic in this approach goes out the window.<p>For block based memory (to make use of infinite &quot;block space&quot;) in general, you not only have to move a number of blocks of an arbitrary number to locations an arbitrary distance away, but you have to autonomously generate and destroy an arbitrary number of blocks, too. Cobblestone, Ice, Pumpkins, and Melons all do this and are thankfully Redstone distinguishable, so we at least have our endless supply of symbols for such a tape. There are additional requirements and engineering challenges, but they fall outside the purpose of this post.<p>Issues like these are not considered in almost all the claims Minecraft&#x27;s Turing Completeness that I have seen. They absolutely should be. Obviously there may be ways around this, but I hope my point is clear. Make sure the application of your &quot;proofs&quot; or constructions actually make sense. Make sure they demonstrate how to handle the memory and the logic (algebra) necessary. And for god&#x27;s sake, make sure that your model is actually an automaton (I&#x27;m looking at you Magic and LBP).<p>On a side note, I did start compiling a paper on the computational complexity of Minecraft a while ago, but left it unfinished. It goes through various generalizations, starting from some most basic (just blocks, redstone, etc.), adding some components like randomness, commandblocks, entities. Even some structural assumptions such as superflat worlds and tiled machines (works for Conways game of life). I lost some motivation because I did not believe people would care enough to be worth my time. Even if I were to pick it up again, the game has changed quite a bit since 1.7 came out. My results might be outdated (new commandblock functionality changes things greatly). However, if others show interest, I could perhaps start working on it again.",1382245792

If your company can put FPGAs within reach of more people, that would be awesome.<p>I used to work at a startup company that had a plan to reduce power consumption in data centers by spinning down hard drives when they weren&#x27;t in use.  Too late, we learned that there isn&#x27;t a lot of money in saving power.  The average data center in the US might spend $500k/year on electricity.  That sounds like a lot, until you consider that the fully loaded cost of a good engineer will be around $200k/year.  Power becomes a factor only when you hit a wall in terms of how much can be delivered to the data center.<p>I was an electrical engineer in college, and I learned how to write Verilog and do register-transfer-level design.

But it offers some things that are more important to customers: infinite scalability, the ability to run on commodity hardware, and the ability to interface with the system via normal-looking software.<p>Actually, even writing Java code is too difficult for many Hadoop users now.

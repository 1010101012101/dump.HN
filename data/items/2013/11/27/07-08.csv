Mark was a dick who shit on quite a few people in his day and deserved a little bit in return.  Thinking that he was some choirboy that I beat up is a very naive way to view the world, but that&#x27;s what I expect from someone who builds up mythical opinions of people they&#x27;ve never met.<p>Anyway, closing this tab now.

6807005,comment,6800387,6805492,1,0,Silhouette,,,"I can see two potential twists in your argument that people using tech companies create new social norms, which seems fairly reasoned on the face of it.<p>Firstly, there is a question akin to informed consent. People do use these services and voluntarily give up a lot of privacy, but is that an informed decision, or is it because they don&#x27;t understand the significance of what they are doing? Although many people share much information with organisations like Facebook and Google, there have been significant popular backlashes against a number of changes they have made, particularly those that have resulted in information being disclosed to people that the users who supplied it didn&#x27;t expect.<p>To extend your bathroom window analogy, there is an argument here akin to sharing certain normally private behaviour with your doctor. This is something you do by choice, in your own interests, and with a clear understanding that the information is sensitive and not to be disclosed to anyone else or used for any other purpose. This is fundamental to medical ethics, and in many places it is protected explicitly by law, so doctors can&#x27;t be pressured to disclose that kind of sensitive information, even by the police. Lawyers themselves are of course familiar with a similar argument, again establishing attorney-client privilege or the equivalent as a matter of universal professional ethics and protected by force of law.<p>Secondly, modern technologies like computers and the Internet are part of a very young and fast-evolving industry that is changing our normal expectations in many aspects of life. In many contexts, the overall effect is positive, but there can be serious negative consequences in some cases. I think it would be unwise for the courts to attempt to reinterpret major constitutional or human rights laws based only on the fact that this week X out of Y people were happy to share something with a specific web site. It takes longer than that for social norms to develop, and as always the law should reflect our ethics rather than try to dictate how things should be.<p>I do think privacy is going to be a big issue over perhaps the next decade or so, as we collectively work through the implications of modern technologies and decide what is acceptable behaviour and what isn&#x27;t. I also think you&#x27;re right that dedicated laws are going to be needed, rather than merely trying to adapt laws written for a time before the kinds of implications we are now seeing and starting to understand. I wonder whether this won&#x27;t be a generational issue, as digital natives who consider things like being on-line and having mobile devices to be basic and universal facilities start to assert their independence, while the political dinosaurs who clearly don&#x27;t understand even the basics of how this technology works and its implications are replaced by the generation in between who are perhaps both more open-minded on these subjects and less willing to trust the government by default.",1385538327

Basically a similar idea to Parakeet or Numba, but with GLSL as a target.<p>The problem with doing this on WebGL (which is essentially GLES2) is that the internal precision of the pipeline is not required to be a full 32 bit float. There are 10 bit integers and 20 bit floating point numbers and all sorts of funny number formats in the hardware. When most scientific/numeric computation is done in 64 bit double precision, going to less than 32 bits is a problem.<p>Of course it still could be done in WebGL, the problem is that running it on different hardware would yield different results.

I only studied it for a few years.<p>Personality theory is one of the weakest branches on the tree of psychology because of its historical roots and because of the difficulty of applying the full apparatus of science. There is no universal consensus for personality theories as there is about, for example, behavioural conditioning. Not even close. My personality textbook was very, very thick and nobody mentioned in it agreed with anybody else.<p>The strongest results in personality work so far come from aggregating work from different existing models; that&#x27;s how the Five Factor Model (including the Intro/Extra axis) was developed.<p>The strength of the FFM is that it comes from multiple lines of evidence (lexical studies and factor analysis of existing personality tests <i>regardless of underlying theoretical model</i>). That is: it arose from what appears in the data, not from what appears to fit particular theories of personality. Indeed it finds support from work done on theories that flatly contradict it. Put another way, the FFM finds widespread support because it is merely descriptive.<p>Eventually, as I say, more work from the neuro direction will begin to tease out what, if any, correlations can be found with underlying neurophysiology. A quick squiz at Wikipedia shows some early fMRI studies with different brain activation patterns for folk identified as extra/introverted.",1385537420

Unfortunately, the DUKW (which was designed for a ship-to-shore dip like at Normandy) wasn&#x27;t up to the seafaring in store, and they ended up marooned in that very jungle.

6806905,comment,6793291,6805028,2,0,sanskritabelt,,,"Maybe I was unclear.  To be explicit, the experimental setup was:\n* Draw a sample of objects (in this case, an &#x27;object&#x27; was a set of text documents) \n* Apply the OLD and NEW treatments to each sampled object \n* Show the results of OLD and NEW to volunteers (double blind, of course), get an evaluation.<p>And so the data I get is:\n(object 1, SCORE OLD 1, SCORE NEW 1)\n(object 2, SCORE OLD 2, SCORE NEW 2)\netc<p>So again:\n* I don&#x27;t have any prior knowledge of how the scores are going to be distributed\n* The primary reason I expected OLD to be &#x27;better&#x27; than NEW is because OLD had theory behind it, and NEW was an ad hoc tweak of a previously rejected treatment\n* The very initial text corpus was fixed\n* The objects were selected from the initial corpus through a multistep process, at least one of those steps was a stochastic optimization of an objective function\n* One of the treatments was also obtained through a constrained optimization \n* The initial text corpus wasn&#x27;t all that large, and the samples were pretty small<p>So what I did was look at all observations for which OLD SCORE was different than NEW SCORE.  Say there were n of them, and say that for p of those OLD<NEW.  If NEW wasn&#x27;t producing results that scored better than OLD, we would expect p/n to be less than 0.5, up to some uncertainty from the random sample.  This is just a straight up test of a binomial parameter, so I computed confidence intervals and found that 0.5 was several standard deviations below the observed p/n, from which I concluded that NEW was better than OLD and we should switch.\n(as described here: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sign_test"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sign_test</a>)<p>In a more responsible analysis I could have done something more sophisticated and modeled the scores as a sum of object effect, tester effect, treatment effect, fixed term, noise, etc. Given the magnitude of the sign test score, I didn&#x27;t feel that was necessary.",1385536087

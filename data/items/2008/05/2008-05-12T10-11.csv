187459,comment,187163,187163,0,0,martincmartin,,,"You're absolutely right.  I'm assuming the other hackers that are interviewing the manager will take care of that.  Usually, technical skills are almost the only focus, so the post focuses only on the management skills.<p>I was part of a team interviewing manager candidates, and it seemed the <i>only</i> thing people focused on was technical ability.  We passed by several very good candidates who were only so-so technically, and got someone who was really good technically but failed pretty much every question asked here.  He proved so incompetent that we let him go after a few months.<p>It was actually kind of depressing, I could see the wrong decisions being made, but none of the other hackers knew much about this ""management stuff,"" so I couldn't convince them.",1210589452
187458,comment,187365,187365,0,0,idea,,,"> So type inference. You can do type inference. Except that it's lame, because it doesn't handle weird dynamic features like upconverting integers to Doubles when they overflow.<p>Pretty weak argument against type inference. Yegge has used OCaml so i expected better arguments.<p>And JavaScript 2 is getting type annotations, so the trend is more likely in the other direction to improve performance.",1210589452

187456,comment,187310,187380,0,0,paulsb,,,"So very true. The best you can get in the UK is about 24 Mbps down, and 1.3 Mbps up - and that is with ADSL. When it comes to cable, there is only really one operator and that is Virgin Media. When it was NTL it was really good: fast, reliable, no throttling and no monitoring. But when Virgin bought it, then everything went tits-up: throttling, unreliable and part of the phorm debacle. If I had my choice I would go for the Scandinavian or Japanese system, i.e. fast and relentless.",1210588949

187454,comment,187208,187208,0,0,michael_dorfman,,,"What a sad, sad article.  A provocative title, with nothing to back it up.<p>The author comes up with two reasons for not learning a new language: 1) expanding your mind is worthless, otherwise we'd all be taking LSD, and 2) if you have a new toy to play with, you might neglect your primary tool.<p>The second point is a reasonable one; obviously, people shouldn't invest in learning a new language unless their fluency and competence in their primary language is such that they can easily sacrifice the time.<p>The first point is nonsense; the LSD metaphor is a poor one, and it would be more relevant (and useful) to compare learning a new programming language to learning a new spoken language.<p>In other words: not even a good troll.  Sorry, thanks for playing!",1210588642

187452,comment,187015,187075,0,0,timnic,,,"I was watching a video by Elizabeth Warren of Harvard Law School on the topic the other day. The gist of it is (I think) basically that housing and healthcare are taking up most of the money of the middle class. In the 1970-ties a single earner could bring in enough money to support the whole family. Now in the middle class both parents have to work, which doubles the financial risk for the family if one of them (for example) looses a job.

187442,comment,187195,187195,0,0,tdavis,,,"It's common for one very simple reason: Programatically, it is much easier to demand user input in a single form than to code for different cases. In this specific case I don't understand it so much because it's exceedingly simple to write a regex replace that replaces every instance of ""not a number"" with nothing. The linked page describes a less-general use of this in Perl, but it's just as easy in any other modern language.<p>Here's a single line of python that removes any character that isn't a digit from the string ""s"":<p><pre><code>    re.sub(r'[^\d]', '', s)
</code></pre>
Wow, that was almost too easy. Now the user can put spaces, dashes, periods, underscores... who cares! Oh, and if they put in the CSV code or something at the end...<p><pre><code>    re.sub(r'[^\d]', '', s)[0:16] 
</code></pre>
A single line should cover 99% of the problems the user can create. Compliment it by giving an example of how the number should be input and... done.",1210586916

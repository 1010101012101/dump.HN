It was a 4 yr old PC. We wanted new graphics card and we had to replace entire PC except power supply (barely!) and the case.<p>Even more fun, we wanted to build a PC from the leftover parts for friend of my son who is less fortunate.

We ended up spending $150 for new power supply, overpriced memory (DDR2), thermal grease, new fan (plastic leg broke off the original) and set of screws (where are they when you need them?).<p>In the end, upgrade = new PC, setting up the old one was still super expensive ($150).<p>Another factor is: these phones get a beating in daily use.

10763692,comment,10763436,10763588,0,0,bertil,,,"Let’s assume a government asks Facebook about private information. In the US, it can do so via with secret courts, so the people being surveilled cannot know about and oppose it. In that case, Facebook is the only one who could do something about it: they can do so by arguing that revealing that information would put them in legal trouble. How that works, I have no idea: the court is secret, so is the idiosyncrasies of its appeal process.<p>The possibility that Facebook could be attacked makes the lawyers unhappy: their job includes minimising risks, and this is a big one given the PR around it. The ability to oppose abusive requests makes the (very many) privacy-concerned employees happy: they really don’t like spending their career helping ideas they strongly oppose. That’s why you can have contradictory statements.<p>The real issue here is the existence of secret courts, and administrative processes that exclude judges and the basic legal protection (guaranteed by the Fourth amendment in the US). Facebook can’t really oppose <i>that</i> without exposing itself to spin around being pro-terrorists (which is mind-boggling when you think about how loudly the same people talk about “Freedom”). Allowing an appeal and maintaining needed discretion in certain matters is a delicate problem, but hardly a new one in law.<p>It sounds to me (not a legal expert) that what would be preferable is to have a Public defender for privacy, fluent in legal and technical matter, who be made privy to secret decision, and not allowed to contact the people being targeted before they know about the surveillance. The ACLU sounds like they could recommend good candidates. A judge should be able to do that, and Congress at a higher level — but whomever was in charge lately has dropped the ball quite dramatically, being both lied to and far too lenient in what they knew.",1450536797

Once it passes congress, the only way for it to be defeated would be for the president to veto the enormous budget bill based only on the amendment, which he is very unlikely to do (even if he did disapprove of CISA, which I don&#x27;t think he does).",1450535452

UX means usability, UI is the more aesthetic side of the exercise, though of course there is considerable overlap</i><p>I&#x27;ve never understood how the concept of &quot;UI&quot; ever evolved to not encompass usability at it&#x27;s core.<p>I was happy to cede UI territory to the designers who said they&#x27;d do it better.  Even when I was insulted to my face that because I&#x27;m a programmer and liked my arcane typing based interfaces for myself, so therefore I couldn&#x27;t possibly understand making usable software for others.  I bit my tongue, put my head down and went back to the things I wanted to focus on anyway.<p>In the time since, user interfaces have experienced gradual incremental improvement just like everything in computing.  But rather than going for &quot;nothing else left to take away&quot; design (or perhaps due to a shortsighted version of it) visual clutter was just turned into mental clutter. The number of WIMP nouns and verbs the average user has to understand are higher than ever, with less consistent behavior, and overflowing with one-off slightly different implementations to remember.<p>Rather than any grand improvements, I&#x27;ve only seen degenerate phenomenons for making user experience worse. My favorites being: A well-managed brand name, good aesthetics and software reputation means that when someone (eg. Apple) ships a bad interaction, users that would (rightly) blame the software first before working around it, start blaming themselves first for &quot;not getting it&quot;.  Or that products evolving quickly (such as the early years of Facebook) are bewilderingly unusable to people that don&#x27;t log in often enough to keep up with the UI changes as they happen in small increments.<p>Then after waking up from their bender the UI folks start talking loudly about UX.  I thought that was the goddamn point all along!  Oh, but what do I possibly know?  I only have formal training in what we used to call Human-Computer Interaction, and I quite like my console shells.  And shells have bad aesthetics, so they must have bad ux too.  And at least the UI guys managed to get 1 of the 2, I guess I&#x27;ll just go back to holding my tongue now.",1450534766

In most cases, the example you give are just too large for anything they do to be outsourced to anyone else - few other companies operate on Amazon scale.<p>The &quot;outsource everything&quot; mantra may also be fueled in part by VC firms who also just happen to be funding a bunch of other companies that... look at that... provide some of the services you should outsource.  Many years ago, on a small scale, I had discussions with a small VC firm.  In exchange for their investment, we were also expected to use some of the other companies in their network whenever possible (media/marketing/other tech/etc).  That seems a bit of an extreme scenario, but i can&#x27;t imagine this doesn&#x27;t ever happen at all.",1450534069

Milk and semen are <i>not</i> symbolic to Catholics. Neither is urine. Blood is, sort of, but dowsing a statue in it would be to miss the meaning of it entirely. That&#x27;s saying something because lots of things are symbolic to Catholics.<p>The entertainer, Madonna used to drape herself in Catholic symbolism as well, even filming her music video in Churches and featuring herself having affairs with the statuary. I don&#x27;t think anyone of any intelligence attributed any more to it than an attempt to shock the audience. I&#x27;d argue that Madonna&#x27;s work is more aesthetically pleasing that Serrano&#x27;s, (a framed turd is still a turd,) and that&#x27;s really the only differentiator in this case.",1450533981

I would also argue there is nothing wrong with an artist speaking from their own perspective instead of one that is forced upon them.\n&quot;Should&quot; is a very naughty word. Our government &quot;should not&quot; servey us, but they &quot;should&quot; in order to keep us safe. Artists &quot;should not&quot; create selfish peices but they &quot;should&quot; speak in their own voice.<p>There was a recent exhibit i found particularly interesting where the artist used real dead bodies. This was interesting because he was legally alowed to and others would pay to go see it. The art itself is not appealing but it applies to the fourth wall. Our world today is filled with so many loopholes and rediculous businesses that an art peice like this reflects on it. If the artist did not speak selfishly, these kind of rediculous loopholes may never be exposed. But in the same notion, would should look at our own lives and recognize art is not a unique case, obvious and loud but far less damaging in many regards",1450533848

The rest of the recipe sites suck.. no reviews, no feedback, no indication that a recipe is good or not. <p>At the house I lived in during college we had a strict ""No Internet Recipes"" rule. But that was... well a while ago.\n",1174694109

Keep in mind, Dozens of mods and hacks have been written for Tivos, many which greatly enhance the built in functionality [2]..<p>The question now is what will Apple Do- They could go either the Tivo/Xbox route and try to lock it down, or go the Linksys route, and embrace the hackers and agree that they add value.<p>\nIt's too early to tell for sure which route they'll take, but from early indications it looks like they're A) Making it easy to hack- This lets people develop on it, and make cool things, without getting in the way.. They are doing this while also b) Not guaranteeing that the system won't change..<p>Essentially, anything made for it can stop working with the next set fromt eh factory. This means that most companies would be insane to develop anything for it, since their investment could be stopped by a third party in a second..<p>It seems like what Apple is doing is letting Hackers play and extend, while stopping any larger players from getting involved.<p>Interesting move.<p>\n[1]<a href=""http://crunchgear.com/2007/03/23/hackers-hack-hacked-apple-tv-to-play-divx/"">http://crunchgear.com/2007/03/23/hackers-hack-hacked-apple-tv-to-play-divx/</a>\n[2] Such as the ability to have a web interface, to schedule recordings from work\n",1174692527

This would be an improvement over what a digg does in that they store your links and rank them by popularity, but they manage the grouping (Politics, Technology, etc).  Does this resonate?",1174692312

The good that can come from this is that conventional media might further understand the paradigm shift in how people want to be entertained. The record companies are still trying to get on the ball so it'll be interesting to see where this is heading.\n",1174691756

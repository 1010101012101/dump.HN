9418928,comment,9416546,9417686,0,0,23david,,,"LXD sounds like another (rkt also...) promising alternative to Docker for running containerized workflows. A few major differences that I can see between LXD and Docker are: a) the security model and focus, where LXD uses LXC natively for security/isolation and is trying to further enhance with cpu-level isolation of some kind b) it sounds like LXD containers will support running init systems, which will make it much easier to deploy bare-metal and VM workloads in LXD containers versus Docker containers c) live-migration, and d) no &#x27;batteries included&#x27; so the equivalent of the docker registry isn&#x27;t installed and setup by default as is the case with Docker.<p>It appears that Canonical is positioning LXD as more of a drop-in and simple alternative to VMs. It&#x27;s also nice to see that LXD containers will support running docker containers within them. So you can have your &#x27;pod&#x27; of application containers all running within one big LXD container if you want. Good times.",1429685364

9418920,comment,9416539,9418785,0,0,beagle3,,,"> We can&#x27;t legislate that you don&#x27;t spoof - it&#x27;ll simply be an arms race. If you want to participate in a market without spoofers, simply require a deposit for offers cancelled within a certain period of time.<p>That&#x27;s like saying &quot;we can&#x27;t legislate vendors don&#x27;t do a bait-and-switch&quot; or &quot;we can&#x27;t legislate against false advertising&quot;. We can, we have, and it made life better for society at large. The false advertising arms race is still on - but the collateral damage to consumers is significantly smaller than it was before those laws were enacted.<p>We can legislate &quot;don&#x27;t spoof&quot;, and we have (for some proverbial we), but any law is useless without enforcement - and there is no enforcement for these regulations. Additionally, at present the SEC is a part of the spoofing arms race, and is massively (and some say willingly due to regulatory capture) underfunded and incompetent in that race with no intent to win.<p>You want to legislate it so that it has teeth? Publish pseudonymized order flow six months after the fact (changing identifiers every day, for example), and give someone who can use this data to prove spoofing 10% of the proceeds of any fines levied thanks to their work. (Sure, pseudonymity is hard, and may be impossible. But 6 months after the fact is enough time for that to matter little in case of trades).<p>You want to stop it without changing enforcement mechanism? Charge for unexecuted orders, or otherwise limit their numbers. In fact, some european exchanges have very stiff penalties if you have >10:1 ratio of orders:fills - and spoofing there is almost nonexistent.<p>But SEC behaviour indicates that they have no intention of fixing that aspect of the market.<p>> It&#x27;s like passing laws making web-scraping for email addresses into hacking. It feels like it&#x27;ll make us safer, but because &quot;only criminals have guns&quot; it just ends up shooting a few people in the foot and weakening us overall against actual threats.<p>No, it&#x27;s not. Exchanges are few and (supposedly) extremely well regulated. The number of &quot;bad actors&quot; (spoofers or otherwise) is also small and under strict regulation.<p>Your claim that it is is nonsensical. An equivalent claim is &quot;It&#x27;s like making shooting people in the streets a crime. It feels like it&#x27;ll make us safer, because only criminals will shoot people but it ends up weakening us overall against actual threats&quot;. We have made that a crime, we&#x27;ve done what&#x27;s needed to enforce those laws, and it has made us stronger, not weaker.",1429685253

9418918,comment,9416575,9418763,0,0,Animats,,,"That guy is bogus. There have been some real cryogenic computing devices, though. IBM and NSA put huge efforts into that back in the 1950s.  (&quot;I want a thousand megacycle computer. I&#x27;ll get you the money&quot; - NSA director).[1]  The first generation technology, cyrotrons, sort of worked, but mainstream technologies pulled ahead, and that technology was abandoned in 1965. IBM kept plugging away at cyrogenic computing through the 1980s, with Josephson junctions being the next technology. Those run at liquid helium temperatures. With great difficulty and at huge cost, they got some experimental electronics (not a full CPU) running at 300MHz. By this time, it was 1982, and while that was about 10x faster than the fastest microprocessors of the period, it looked like the upper limit of the technology was around 1GHz.  That, plus high cost, plus all the headaches of working in liquid helium, indicated the Josephson junction was a dead end.  Standard CMOS was going to outperform the exotic technology.  So, in 1983, IBM pulled the plug on that project.<p>They&#x27;re trying again.[2]  IBM is working on superconducting quantum computing, and has been busy since 2012.  Maybe this time it will be useful.  It will definitely be expensive.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.ewh.ieee.org/tc/csc/europe/newsforum/pdf/RN28-1.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ewh.ieee.org/tc/csc/europe/newsforum/pdf/RN28-1.p...</a>\n[2] <a href=""http://defensesystems.com/Articles/2014/12/04/IARPA-cryogenic-exascale-supercomputing.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">http://defensesystems.com/Articles/2014/12/04/IARPA-cryogeni...</a>",1429685200

9418898,comment,9416078,9416078,0,0,slackstation,,,"Why do we think cheap rent is such a factor in making a tech city? Innovating and inventing new tech is expensive. Everyone in the chain knows this, Founders, VC, tech workers. You pay them well (or in the case of Founders sacrifice alot) but, it&#x27;s worth it in the end because the gains from that initial work are so large.<p>What makes a great tech city is access to a large pool of highly trained people. SF has this, LA (in theory) has this, Austin, NYC and other places in the US has this.  Tech cities also should be places people want to go. Weather is a huge consideration. Detroit is cold. SF and LA are warm. I don&#x27;t care that my rent is $500/mo if I&#x27;m freezing. I&#x27;ll gladly pay $2,500 for the same place for 75F degree sunny weather year round.<p>Culture is another big aspect. When I&#x27;m not working, I want to find interesting things to do, places to visit, food to eat, people to interact with. I think this is why NYC would be a decent startup city despite it&#x27;s terrible weather.<p>Density has a role to play that we don&#x27;t fully understand. Austin would be a great example that checks all the boxes (and has a low cost of living to boot) but, hasn&#x27;t exactly exploded as far as startups are concerned. Miami too as it has actually tropical weather and beaches.<p>Detroit is lacking is so many areas. Density is going to be a problem. Weather is a huge problem; most of the country is warmer and more temperate than Detroit (which is also on the lake so added windchill factor). Detroit is blighted which means unless you are 22 and like warehouse parties or some young hipster and enjoy the early stages of gentrification, Detroit isn&#x27;t for you. Also, who wants to raise kids in Detroit? Lead in the soil? No thanks, I&#x27;d pay the extra money to live someone where my kid&#x27;s IQ isn&#x27;t stunted irreversibly.<p>My question is why are people <i>still</i> in Detroit? If you are going to try to make a new startup city, why not try Miami or Orlando or Austin or Dallas or San Diego? Why freeze your ass off, just so you can brag about it later? What is the city council going to do that&#x27;s so freeing to your ability to write software?",1429684135

The purpose for this was defense not only of the state, but of the individual.<p>But even though I am a gun owner, I think the second amendment is extremely dated and should be ignored. So <i>what</i> if the founding fathers thought civilians should own guns? However intelligent and knowledgable they were, they have been superseded in all dimensions by two centuries of scientific and technological progress. If gun ownership decreases crime, OK. Tweak the laws to increase gun ownership. If it increases crime, OK. Do the opposite. If some middle-ground licensing thing works, do that. I find firearms fun to shoot, and I could see how they could be useful in self-defense, but what I really care about is the well-being of people. It&#x27;s best to do whatever helps people, not what some centuries-old text says.<p>Fortunately, if the Talmud and D&D have taught us anything, it&#x27;s that people can interpret any rule to match their existing view.

This requires skills like listening, positioning, negotiating, empathy, technical and also truly understanding the actual reasons someone is compelled to buy your technology.\n#3 - Manage a pipeline: fill it with more prospective deals that look like those that do close; qualify and then remove those that don&#x27;t. \n#4 - Build trust with prospective and existing customers.<p>At b2b startups, sales people are there to help discover, build, and tune the repeatable sale -- this important work at a startup will help you (and your board) learn if/where it even exists!<p>Unfortunately, if you took 10 companies, good at sales but kinda bad at engineering.

Just compare the ""physics"" section on the ArXiv (that isn't filtered) with any major physics journal (where it can take up to 1 year to get something published after multiple iterations).",1216465187
250612,comment,250580,250598,0,0,Tichy,,,"I like this suggestion a lot. Already I can throw out several ideas. Actually several projects evolve around things I need, but I think I can sort them by the hierarchy of needs. There is one I hope will help me fix my health issues, so that should probably have first priority.",1216464946

It was just a tick box on the OS list, and didn't add any cost or force me to jump through hoops.<p>Speccing the same machine through Lenovo's website was a little more painful, but still doable.  Looks like XP will stay around for a while.",1216464196

Most businesses I've worked for over the last five years are still wedded to PCs and Windows, and wouldn't ever change -- too much risk, too much potential expense, etc. I would guess that most of the growth in Apple's sales are to home users or very small businesses, not corporate.<p>I'm a Mac enthusiast, I'm a Linux enthusiast, but I wouldn't recommend most businesses switching to those platforms (on the desktop, at least) except in a very limited set of circumstances.",1216462543

There are others. Slashdot for example caught on in the general population after the hoards of readers would bring down servers after a single post ~ <a href=""http://pasadena.wr.usgs.gov/office/stans/slashdot.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://pasadena.wr.usgs.gov/office/stans/slashdot.html</a> and news organisations through Journalists started using Slashdot as their geek filter and quoting it in news.<p><i>""... The whole gentrification argument doesn't really hold well with the definition of gentrification ...""</i><p>Depends on what you mean by gentrification. I think in this case it might be the gentrification of ideas, implementation and audience. An inability to improve the quality of the site. Slashdot at the start (suid 2774) when I joined was full of new and interesting ideas. Full of readers with technical backgrounds who you could pose questions you would never get the answers to reading a book, news groups even the source. You had to be on the ball to answer or you would be howled down with logic and facts.  I left slashdot when the discussion and flow of new ideas deteriated into low quality opinions. Just like this one.",1216461687

It was never mass-marketed to me.<p>2.  MySpace is not spam.  There is a concentrated level of marketing, and it is sometimes obnoxious, but you could say that about Times Square.  Marketing itself is not evil.  Some people love watching movie previews.  Myspace does not hamper my ability to use email, nor do spammers on myspace interfere with my ability to use it.  I don't mind getting friend requests and event requests from Bands, and honestly I don't even mind the ""Click for Nude WebCam"" spam.  If MySpace spam bothers you that much, it's easy enough to simply shut down your account, create a new one, or change your email address.  But again, the product as a whole isn't spam at all.<p>3.  I really don't care whether Tom created MySpace or not.  I think it's an effective way to handle customer service.<p>4.  Chris DeWolfe sounds like he might be a Bad Man, but how does that relate to the product?<p>5.  What is bad about MySpace being a direct assult on Friendster?<p>While I appreciate the information, and am glad to see someone sharing it, the tone of the article is very sensational.",1180148079

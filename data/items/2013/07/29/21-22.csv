Just want to add a couple things to Jeremy&#x27;s response.<p>As specified later in the article, of a 99c app or in app purchase, 29c goes to Apple, 20c goes to MGWU and 50c goes to the developer. Thus as Jeremy mentioned, we only take 30% of post Apple revenues, much less than most publishers. This explains why devs get 50% of the revenue from a 99c app (as mentioned in the article). Again publishing through us is not mandatory, and developers retain ownership of 100% of the code they write during the internship.<p>Our intention was not to use their age for marketing, we initially told them to mention it in HN posts to show the supportive HN community what amazing things they are doing at a young age. Our recent posts have not included age (<a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=6093363"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=6093363</a>).<p>It really pains me to hear we&#x27;re coming off as exploiting young developers, and I&#x27;m hoping this stems from a misunderstanding of our model. I absolutely agree that making games is about learning, creating and making, and we&#x27;re doing everything in our power to enable more students to have better experiences building games.",1375135191

6124151,comment,6123720,6123720,17,0,ReidZB,,,"I think SHA-2 should be &quot;minor weakness discovered&quot; (if not outright &quot;unbroken&quot;), not &quot;weakened&quot;.<p>At the onset of the SHA-3 competition, everyone was nervous about SHA-2: it appeared as though a good attack was inevitable, what with the cryptanalytic attacks on SHA-1.<p>But as the competition went on, things got calmer. The attacks against SHA-2 that were so expected simply weren&#x27;t coming[1]. And so now the status quo is that SHA-2 seems pretty darn safe, and the real focus of the SHA-3 competition shifted towards not necessarily having a direct replacement for SHA-2, in the sense of performance, but instead having a design that was sufficiently different to not allow SHA-2 attacks to apply to it. And Keccak is just that: quite different.<p>Anyway, my point is that SHA-2 is mislabeled. Honestly, I think cryptographers recommend it the most out of any of the hash functions currently; SHA-3&#x27;s software performance is rather... lacking.<p>[1] Some may argue that this is because cryptographers were focused on the SHA-3 candidates, but I&#x27;m not so sure",1375135115

The theorem states that the angles at the base of an isosceles triangle (defined as a triangle with two legs of equal length) are equal and appears as the fifth proposition in Book I of Euclid&#x27;s Elements.<p>Generalizing the concept a bit, a pons asinorum is a critical concept in any field, such that if you don&#x27;t grasp it you&#x27;ll never comprehend the field as a whole. 0.999... = 1 is the critical point for the idea of the infinite series and, thus, an important part of how mathematicians use infinity.<p>And the concept of infinity seems to be the stumbling block for a lot of people, in the Internet arguments I&#x27;ve seen about this. A fair number of people seem to hold a religious fear of infinity, at least to the extent they apparently believe that it cannot be handled in a logical fashion; it is sacred and not to be mixed with such profane ideas as 3 or 12. Mix that with a half-formed notion of infinitesimals and some cod-Platonism and you have people seriously arguing that math is wrong and that they have inspired access to a true mathematical revelation.<p>Or they deny that the argument is mathematical at all and retreat into increasingly self-contradictory pseudo-philosophical arguments.",1375134789

I&#x27;m not going to lie - at first I thought the same exact thing as yourself. I was very hesitant, but realizing I had nothing to lose I jumped into the program and it has been one of the best decisions I&#x27;ve made. This program is very supportive to beginning game designers and helps us to refine our skills and ideas. The thing that really made this experience worth while is that when the time comes they take care of art and music. I&#x27;m not the most artistic person and that allows me to fully do the coding I want, to make the game I want. Without having to worry about how it looks and sounds. It is great.",1375134407

Add to that one of my brothers working in a hospital (he&#x27;s a few years from graduating as a doctor) and other sources, and I can get an estimate that I hope is correct to an order of magnitude. A relative has been a customer of the Cleveland clinic, so I know the exact number he paid. I also know the exact number another person paid for the exact same surgery here in Uruguay - it was close to one-tenth, and he chose to pay private rather to go through the public institutions (which have huge delays).<p>Below is a PDF in Spanish, on an investigative piece from a weekly that goes into great detail on the costs of surgery in Uruguay. I&#x27;ll just quote some basic numbers:<p>- Fixed fee per major surgery (medical act) UY$ 27.500 / U$ 1300<p>- Monthly Head Heart Surgeon salary (per hospital) UY$ 263.000 / U$ 12500<p>- Other heart surgeons, between UY$ 162.500 and 243.000 depending on seniority and other factors - U$ 8.000 to 12.000 range, per month. Those are close to the best salaries anywhere in Uruguay, usually as well trained as any doctor in the U.S.<p>- Cost to the hospital per major operation (heart surgery), UY$ 206.000 / U$ 10.000<p>Smaller operations like angioplasty cost UY$ 60.000 / U$ 3.000<p>The most expensive surgery is heart transplant, which costs UY$ 684.000 / U$ 32000<p>All those are set by the government, so those ARE the actual costs (well, actually they were in 2008, I didn&#x27;t adjust by inflation and exchange rate), no insurance or strange stuff involved. The patient is not billed a cent, but there is a huge delay (months usually), and doctors don&#x27;t really schedule surgery unless it&#x27;s critical for the person&#x27;s health (almost no quality of life procedures through the public system).<p><a href=""http://www.semanario-alternativas.info/archivos/2008/5)mayo/18---16.05.2008/PDF_portada/portada/el_negocio_de_la_enfermedad.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.semanario-alternativas.info/archivos/2008/5)mayo/...</a><p>PD: Surgeons and Anesthesists have tremendous power, and managed to get paid close to ten times the rate of other doctors.",1375134141

Few people would post that kind of information by taking a risk. Moreover, people can only truly discuss something when they don&#x27;t know each other.\nIf there is a user ID attached to a user, a discussion tends to become a criticizing game. On the other hand, under the anonymous system, even though your opinion/information is criticized, you don&#x27;t know with whom to be upset. Also with a user ID, those who participate in the site for a long time tend to have authority, and it becomes difficult for a user to disagree with them.

Getting something going fast enough is tough (G loads, aero loads, material in the launcher, etc) but doable. A really really big light gas gun should do, if the &quot;Slingatron&quot; won&#x27;t. Thing is, you cannot shoot something from the planet&#x27;s surface to orbit. Just can&#x27;t.<p>If energy is too low, you&#x27;re normal ballistic, and the projectile falls somewhere downrange. If energy is too high, you escape from Earth&#x27;s gravity well, and you never see the thing again. (This might be fine for sending materials to the Moon, though.)<p>What if the energy is just right? Well, you go into orbit with closest approach at exactly your altitude. Which is you one orbit later... if aero effects haven&#x27;t already caused enough energy loss to run the projectile into the surface, as they would on Earth.<p>(Side bar: even on the Moon or Mars, it wouldn&#x27;t work well. Orbit at the height of the highest lunar mountain would be very unstable, though it would work better than on Earth! Might get a few orbits out of it before crashing, if you can find a path without huge mascon changes, and if it doesn&#x27;t hit your launch facility. The top of Mons Olympus still has enough atmosphere to be problematic.)<p>So you have to have high-altitude propulsion to alter your trajectory once you get there, so you can orbit at a reasonable altitude. Which is why they note that they need an onboard rocket. And that&#x27;s unfortunate, because it throws away the appealing simplicity of ground launch: passive payloads (and thus low marginal costs). Now, alongside your space-gun you&#x27;ve also got to design a mass-produced probably-expendable rocket system (with guidance) that can survive wicked G loads. And so here come a lot of extra marginal and development costs and a lower payload fraction. Does your gun-and-rocket system still beat a 2/3-stage rocket? With enough volume it might, but where do you get those customers?<p>I kind of like the idea of shooting your massive space-gun at an active target that can do the orbital circularization for you; either a tug that refuels itself from the projectile, or more exotically a rotating momentum exchange tether. That on-orbit system adds additional development and capital expense, in exchange for very low marginal cost. Which would be nice if you had the volume--but nobody needs that sort of volume in space now (nor is likely to for quite some time.)<p>But once some system with reasonable development costs and acceptable marginal costs has paved the way, it might be a lovely system for bulk material transport (probably mostly volatiles, like water, but maybe also metals for construction).",1375133411

Of course, more people harassing him means that he replies with even more caustic comments, making him even easier to vilify and dislike.

6123975,comment,6123193,6123193,14,0,jeremysmyth,,,"Tor can be used for good and for bad. It&#x27;s the very same problem that Cory Doctorow talks about in his lectures about the War on General Purpose Computing, and it&#x27;s not an easy problem to solve.<p>I&#x27;m an admin on a social/gaming site (a MUD with appendant forum, blogs, and other community elements), and we have had to make a few decisions about Tor in the last couple of years.<p>Some background: the site is quite old, and we have historically encouraged users to sign up without needing to provide a unique ID such as email address. They <i>can</i> provide one, but don&#x27;t have to. In the last few years we have had the problem of occasional griefers log on and cause whatever social havoc they can.<p>Now, my personal feelings about Tor are generally quite positive, and I like the freedoms it provides people who are otherwise restricted by their ISPs or governments from accessing legitimate resources. Like many others have said, Tor is a tool that, while it can be used to do illegal things, is also used to provide a very useful service to people who need it to get on with things you and I take for granted.<p>Now, back to our griefers: We have a number of banning mechanisms based on IP or domain, and they tend to be successful because griefers usually get bored when they can&#x27;t access the site for a couple of hours. However, because a tiny minority of griefers are more persistent, more technically adept, and figured they could use Tor to damage our community, we did a little bit of analysis and found that few if any legitimate users of our site came from Tor exit points, and we chose to block them. The alternative was to require a unique identity during the sign-up process, and frankly we wanted as few hurdles as possible to new users (anyone who knows the MUD community knows that it&#x27;s in decline, and low-friction signups are pretty desirable). So we blacklist Tor exit points from our signup process.\nThe unfortunate fact is that some Tor users do bad things with the fantastic tool at their disposal, and end up spoiling it for the legitimate (and extremely valuable) use cases that make it such an amazing tool. Yet its very anonymity means that there is no easy way to allow one set of uses while disallowing others. This is a hard problem, and one I&#x27;m not smart enough to solve.",1375132837

If the encrypted password is transferred up the application layers to another physical resource that knows the key, and the passwords (encoded and not) or securely wiped from memory immediately after the comparison then this offers some useful protection over plain storage. An attacker would need to compromise both resources (the data store and the key holder) in order to get hold of credentials. For this to be meaningful the security of those resources and the communication between them must be very carefully designed and implemented, but it is wrong to say symmetric encryption is necessarily no better than credentials stored in plain form.<p>If the system can automatically verify a password, i.e. decrypt it, then an attacker can leverage that. You could design a system very carefully that <i>might</i> be invulnerable to memory injection attacks, <i>might</i> not be on boxes that have root escalation vulnerabilities, and which <i>might</i> be using a secure hardware security module--but why? You don&#x27;t need to.

Either way, you&#x27;re right, the GPS coordinates should definitely be checked against the internal dead-reckoning.

6123845,comment,6121300,6123213,1,0,VLM,,,"They&#x27;re not going to be in phase.  Note that if phase relationship is important, at those frequencies cable length being identical is rather important.  But its not relevant to this problem.<p>One big confusion in the electrical world is people use the same noun for audio &quot;mixers&quot; which are as linear as possible, and RF &quot;mixers&quot; which are as non-linear as possible.  They do different things.  linear mixers you could say superimpose signals without changing them.   Much like pumping up the gain on a CD should not distort the sound on a mic at a &quot;DJ&quot; mixer. nonlinear mixers add and subtract signal frequencies from each other and what came in shouldn&#x27;t come out at all.  in fact a BPSK mod is a kind of balanced mixer, with peculiar TTL compatible (or 3.3v or whatever) levels of course.<p>You want a 4-port combiner.  Most passives have a reciprocal path, a 4-port splitter usually makes a decent 4-port combiner.  Think of the gadget that probably splits you cable TV signal in your house.  They&#x27;re electrically and mechanically simple.  And relatively cheap. Also they are somewhat lossy.  Good luck passively splitting a signal 4 ways with less than 6 dB of loss.  And something is warming the resistors in there, so its going to be worse.  Conversely yes you combine multiple signals there will be internal loss but the aggregate output will be higher.  This is kind of the whole point of a class B or class AB amplifier... what if you took two perfectly good signals, 180 degrees out of phase, and (sorta) mixed them (using baluns), well you get very near twice the power out.  Think of putting the whole works in a calorimeter... 4 zero dBm sources will heat it up just as fast combined or separate.<p>Aviation GPS &quot;around 1.5 GHz&quot; works pretty well despite being feet/inches away from a couple watt radar transponder around 1090 MHz or whatever it is exactly for ADS-B.  Physically zorching it sounds unlikely.  Distortion to the point of un demod ability is however possible.  If you generate enough signal to overload it, attenuators are cheap.  High power is expensive.  If you&#x27;re screwing around at &quot;workbench range&quot; you&#x27;re not going to pay $XXX to generate multiple watts of power so you&#x27;re not going to need multiple watt rated attenuators to reduce the sig level to something reasonable.  Cost scales WAY beyond quadratically, like exponential at microwave freqs for a given tech type.  Stuff working around a hundredth of a watt aka 10 dBm is going to be very cheap compared to stuff rated for old fashioned weather radars at kilowatts.<p>My suggestion is make what amounts to exactly one working satellite.  Then make three more.<p>I don&#x27;t think you can feed all four digital signals into the same BPSK mod by doing weird things with the clock rate, modulation does not work that way.<p>What you&#x27;re building is vaguely reminiscent of a cable TV headend.  Both in block diagram and actual wiring.  Of course its been a long time since BPSK was cutting edge in CATV.  If you think of BPSK as no amplitude modulation and either 180 or 0 degree phase modulation depending on 0 or 1 being input, well, a 256QAM signal is just 16 equally spaced levels of amplitude modulation and 16 equally spaced levels of phase modulation, sorta kinda a grown up cousin of the BPSK modulation in GPS signals.  And 256QAM is sort of cutting edge for CATV.  Anyway you could do worse than looking at a wiring diagram of a CATV headend WRT mods and digital sources and combiners and such.<p>Find your local ham radio VHF/UHF microwave club / community.  Don&#x27;t bother with the 160meter low band guys (well, not for this particular individual project, I mean)  By the time you&#x27;re done you&#x27;ll know quite a bit about RF and might gain a new interesting hobby.  Reading several &quot;microwave handbook/project&quot; ham radio books at the library would probably be as good a place to start as any.  You could do worse than some chapters of the ARRL handbook to start.<p>Analog is fun.  People will tell you the world is digital, but even their digital ckts are fundamentally analog.

Both Scala and Clojure are written by seemingly bright people who chose to use the JVM rather than another alternative (Scala code can in theory be compiled to run on the .NET runtime but in practise I understand that's somewhat difficult to achieve).

1103411,comment,1103339,1103339,0,0,patio11,,,"When people ask for marketing advice on HN, one of the things I always suggest is getting to know bloggers in your niche because, hey, help them help you.  This is generally fairly well-received advice here, and has been practiced by many folks successfully.  (I really like Peldi's pitch emails.  They're on his blog somewhere, and are very worthy of emulation.)<p>I am unsure in what relevant respect contacting someone to post something to HN is different than contacting someone to post on their blog.  Is it that we have a reflexive allergy to being marketed to?  I find that people generally don't mind, as long as they're buying what you're selling.  For example, every once in a while I get an email from startups about the new foozit they're working on, particularly for A/B testing.<p>Heck yes, I want to hear about that.  Please, send me email.  I understand you're not sending it to me because you woke up this morning and decided ""What can I selflessly do to brighten Patrick's day?""  That's OK -- we're all businessmen here.  If you know my name and have given enough individualized attention to believe I will like it, I'll at least give it a looksie. (Running /bingo/ against whois records does not count as personalized attention -- and no, I'm also not impressed that you have a fake female persona do the letter.)<p>While it is extremely unlikely that I'd ever submit something from ReadWriteWeb or your tech blog of choice (simply because if it was worth reading y'all would all have already seen it probably days in advance of me), I wouldn't feel particularly dirty submitting something that I discovered via an email.  I mean, since you guys are my main source of startup/software/etc news, and I don't submit duplicates, eliminating the ""somebody told me about this"" route would pretty much mean that the only way to find something to submit would be to write it myself.<p>Not that I have a problem with that, either.  :)",1265374212

Wisdom is difficult, it takes time. If wisdom was just about learning, we'd call it ""knowledge."" It's about learning and life experience.

I think it's a good language, but nowadays my first choice for starting new projects in its niche would be a mix of Lua and C, unless the project depended entirely on a complex library available for Python but not C.<p>I did in fact switch during the 2.x->3.x transition, though I haven't given up on Python entirely - I still know the language, I'm fine with working in it, It's just not my first choice anymore. If there were one factor (and there isn't, my switch to Lua was gradual* ), it would be GvR's insistence that Python will never get tail-call optimization, because it's ""unpythonic"".

Lua feels like a minimalistic hybrid of Python and Scheme, with the ""good parts"" of Javascript (prototypes, object literal notation) harmoniously integrated, but designed with embedded and multi-language development in mind. Also, the whole language can be installed with a DLL smaller than SQLite (!), which makes deployment rather easy.",1265371645

The issue is to what extent your right to free speech is infringed by laws regulating how (or with whom) you use your money.<p>Perhaps an analogy will help.  You have a right to travel freely.  Imagine Congress passes a law banning the use of money to travel between the states.  Money is not travel; yet, the law banning the use of money to travel certainly makes it difficult for you to exercise your travel rights.<p>Now substitute travel with abortion (for abortion rights supporters).  Are abortion rights curtailed by this hypothetical law?  Substitute travel with the purchase of firearms (for the NRA members out there).  Is the right to bear arms infringed?<p>My examples are admittedly simplistic; yet, the point is that there can be a logical connection between the use of money and the exercise of a right -- including the right to free speech.  The extent to which a restriction on the use of money infringes a right, and whether such an infringement is (a) allowed by the Constitution (b) wise as a matter of policy, is open to debate between reasonable people.  However, simply stating that ""Money IS speech"" or ""Money ISN'T speech"" doesn't advance the conversation much, as your question rightly suggests.",1265371542

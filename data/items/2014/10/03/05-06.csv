Going through some random articles feels like hearing someone bitching about random things when in bad mood. I don&#x27;t see much value in that:\n[1] <a href=""http://www.adamhyde.net/why-github-is-bad-for-open-source/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.adamhyde.net/why-github-is-bad-for-open-source/</a>\n[2] <a href=""http://www.adamhyde.net/markdown-ugh/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.adamhyde.net/markdown-ugh/</a><p>I&#x27;d suggest some things here:<p>* Do not post; wait. I don&#x27;t know what was going on when you wrote [2], but you were clearly not in a mood to write anything constructive. Maybe you should have skipped [2] and only write your second article about markdown (not that I really agree with it either (see below), but at least it is developed).<p>* I don&#x27;t really see the point in complaining alone. Maybe you should look for alternatives, and post them along with your complains. Or if you don&#x27;t know any and don&#x27;t want/have time to look for one, ask people (I don&#x27;t know if you can easily add things like discuss on Ghost). For [1], I think you would like GitLab, for example.<p>Honestly, after reading your article about markdown (the long one), I don&#x27;t feel like reading any other of your articles. Not that it&#x27;s bad, but I waited the whole article for some things that never came[<i>], and ended up feeling like I wasted my time there: I just listened to someone complaining about something (mainly about being bad for doing things it&#x27;s not really meant to do), and nothing else. So now I expect to experience the same with any of your articles (and I&#x27;m probably wrong), and I may be missing some great things.\n[</i>] I was expecting some kind of &quot;solution&quot;. Alternatives? Anything?<p>~<p>About the article:<p>You complain about markdown, but use Ghost for your blog (or can you write blog posts with something else on Ghost? Didn&#x27;t see any from their home page). You never mention any alternative.<p>Maybe because there isn&#x27;t many that are:<p>* easy to read without being parsed, with most of the syntax being somewhat explicit<p>* can be used to produce &quot;clean&quot; html<p>* widely used (with some flavors but mainly the same syntax)<p>And that&#x27;s markdown (to me at least). It&#x27;s not here to replace html, MS Word, etc. More like replacing bbcode and other ugly syntaxes. You sound like you&#x27;d rather use plain html, but do you? Would anyone rather use plain html than markdown (when available) for writing simple formatted text? (well yes, some would.. xD)<p>Markdown could greatly benefit from standardization, though. That was the one valid point in your article, imho. It&#x27;s sad but I haven&#x27;t seen many big differences anyway, except:\n* some space differences (line breakings, etc.), but no change in the meaning of the syntax\n* lists must be preceded by an empty line on some parsers\n* custom syntax for additional parsing (images, etc.) but well, that&#x27;s not really a problem with markdown, more like a problem with ghost-flavored (or anythingelse-flavored) markdown<p>It&#x27;s not perfect, and still wouldn&#x27;t be even if standardized (but would be much closer); but I see no better alternative. And neither do you, seemingly. (so no, I did not find your &quot;numerous articles on better alternatives&quot; =/)",1412315642

That&#x27;s not to say that your viewpoint is invalid. Far from it.

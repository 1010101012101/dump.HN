123440,comment,123265,123324,0,0,mynameishere,,,"<i>or about yourself</i><p>At the risk of getting even <i>more</i> downmods for saying true things here, can I just point out that it's a little arrogant to pretend that a blog post about Ruby is going to move someone towards self-actualization?<p>Anyway, have you failed? No. You wanted to show us your favorite line of Ruby code, and you did.<p>As for me, I don't really have a favorite ""one line"" of code, but I fondly remember when I was a kid typing in Nibble Magazine's ""one and two-liner"" programs. Actually, the ""lines"" were lines as defined by the Apple II's command line buffer limit. Here's an example:<p><a href=""http://www.apple2.org.za/mirrors/ground.icaen.uiowa.edu/apple8/Pgms/rotatecube.bas"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.apple2.org.za/mirrors/ground.icaen.uiowa.edu/appl...</a><p>Maybe I'm not a sufficiently abstract person. My favorite two lines of code was an honest-to-god graphical car driving program in two lines of APPLESOFT BASIC [1]. Two lines of code in a language so crappy it's basically a joke. And yet...a full-on-graphical-car-racing program. I'm strongly tempted to think that APPLESOFT BASIC is superior to Ruby, based on the evidence I've seen.<p>Point is: The next time you show a feature of a langauge, maybe make it solve a problem, or create something real, rather than just showing how few characters it takes to do something banal. Adding numbers together? Seriously, it's a solved problem.<p>[1] Sorry for the capital letters, but I'm in Apple mode now:<p><a href=""http://www.apple2.org/images/Literature/a2/BlueBook.JPEG"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.apple2.org/images/Literature/a2/BlueBook.JPEG</a>",1203981729

It also commits you towards a product/strategy direction when it may be better to not file, and stay flexible.<p>Software intellectual property is typically protected by trade secret rather than patents.",1203981361
123436,comment,123081,123423,0,0,hobbs,,,"Right now, almost every car looks like an ergonomic blobject. The trendy thing to do to cars right now is to add chrome, neon, and spinny wheels. If I were to extrapolate a future car from current trends, I'd imagine a chrome egg that glows like Las Vegas.<p>Sure, I could just as easily imagine a car that looked like a matte black monolith. Problem is, that's just a random shot in the dark. There is no current trending to lead me in that direction.<p>I think the genius in creating a new paradigm lies not in extrapolating from superficial trends, but in isolating a fundamental problem that no one else has fully appreciated yet. It would be like predicting a future car that doesn't need to be replaced as soon as it's paid for.",1203981316

I think it would be worth to pay money to be a part of it. If money was the only thing that would interest me, I would probably have become a financial consultant or an estate agent.",1179337889

If it gets -4, 20% will not see it...etc. The poster will always see it and he has no idea that he is being gradually ignored.\n",1179337872

22574,comment,22540,22567,0,0,BrandonM,,,"The 3 points you describe sound more to me like deontology than negative consequentialism.  According to the entry you linked to, deontology judges actions based on the actions themselves, while consequentialism judges actions based on their consequences.  Negative consequentialism, then, involves avoiding actions which produce consequences that are overall negative.  In each case you described, the actions are typically considered deontologically wrong, but the overall consequences of those actions are not negative, so they don't seem to me to be wrong by negative consequentialist standards.<p>Getting back to the topic of the submission, I always presumed that the comment basically meant, ""Don't be like Microsoft.""  Many people call Microsoft the ""Evil Empire"", so this falls in nicely with that theme.  By aligning themselves opposite Microsoft, Google is able to attract that population of hackers which does not appreciate Microsoft's business tactics (things like the FUD campaign that is going on right now in regards to patents).  Whether Google is actually committed to moral business practices or not is debatable, but the motto is a nice way to appear ""hacker-friendly"".",1179337735

Conversely, I vote down a comment if I strongly disagree with it.  Those in between, which I don't feel strongly about, I leave.  Isn't that what the down vote is intended for?",1179336531

Also it doesn't seem like you take people's advice. Your site still have loads of text painfully explaining stuff. In the past nearly everyone said the same things they said here. <p>Do a better design. Drop the text. Make it intuitive/easy to use.",1179335599
22567,comment,22540,22543,0,0,Sam_Odio,,,"I'm not sure if this is right or not, but in philosophy class, I was taught that Google's motto was a manifestation of negative consequentialism: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consequentialism#Negative_consequentialism"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consequentialism#Negative_consequentialism</a> <p>Basically, the ethical decision is that which avoids a negative outcome.  The professor mentioned a number of interesting implications of strict negative consequentialism. The following actions would be morally wrong:<p>- For someone to stave off starvation by stealing a loaf of bread from Bill Gates.<p>- Any type of self defense that involves harming others. Ie: using pepper spray to prevent rape.<p>- Sacrificing one person's life to save the lives of a million others. Ie: killing Hitler before he started WWII.",1179335435

936351,comment,936291,936291,0,0,mixmax,,,"Here is my take at the questions you pose:<p>- The hardest and most boring part of a startup is all the stuff that businesses have to do, but that you don't personally find interesting. I hate accounting and taxes, but I have to do it. Some people don't like marketing, some don't like support, etc. But it has to be done. I'm sure you have something that every business does that you find tremendously boring ;-)<p>- The most enjoyable part (for me at least) is seeing an idea take shape and become a real thing.<p>- Don't worry about scalability at first. If it becomes a problem you can consider yourself a success. Better to get something out the door as fast as possible.<p>- Don't dedicate you learning time to anything, start something instead! Entrepreneurship is one of those things that you can only learn by doing. It's like basketball: You can read loads of books about it but only playing the game will make you a good player. It doesn't have to be youtube, just start with something small. Do a small webapp, sell something online, sell t-shirts. Doesn't matter. It will get you a feel for what it's like, and you'll learn a bunch in the process.<p>- Don't worry too much about spaghetti code at first. You can refactor it later. This is a great learning experience as well. When you've written code that looks tangled and that you can't quite follow, refactor. Messy code can become clean over time.<p>Just my two cents :-)",1257975976

You save a little bit on the inefficiency of fighting gravity for those first few seconds getting off the ground, you save a lot more by easing the design envelope of your rocket nozzle.<p>It's difficult to make a rocket nozzle that works efficiently at the range of pressures from sea level to vacuum, at 50,000 ft atmospheric pressure is nearly 0.1 atm. Because of the exponential nature of the rocket equation even a slight increase in engine Isp can translate to a significant increase in payload (or decrease in vehicle size) or even cross the line of capability. For example, LOX/Kerosene engines tend to top out at a sea level Isp of around 309 seconds, though upper stage LOX/Kerosene engines have been built with vacuum Isps of 353 seconds. This translates to 17:1 and 12:1 mass ratios, which easily makes the difference between feasible and infeasible rockets (17:1 is at the edge of rocket building techniques, 12:1 well within it).",1257975942

936247,comment,935790,936109,0,0,lucumo,,,"I'm afraid that won't work for long. People will read it once and then comply. Maybe the second and third time they'll stop to think about it for a few seconds, but after that it'll get enshrined in muscle memory, without people actually reading the statement, let alone think about it.<p>I believe the posts are only part of the problem, though. The post obviously needs to exist, but it's the votes that make a comment insipid or insidious. Votes are multipliers: nobody cares about a stupid comment with few upvotes and a great comment with many upvotes is an even greater comment. It's when the votes are distributed the other way around that problems start.<p>Furthermore, a poster that gets downvoted will probably learn from the experience whereas if he gets upvoted, he's encouraged.<p>The problem and the solution therefore probably lie in the voting system. There's a few options I can think of right now:<p>* Giving high-karma individuals more voting power. Maybe tiered or maybe on an analogue scale. This has the problem that not all karma as it is now is deserved. (Take mine: I seem to get most upvotes for snide remarks and snarky questions, not for the posts where I want to make a point.) That said, karma probably still is an indicator of quality of posts, so it may work.<p>* Make upvoting cost a bit of karma. I don't think this will work well, since you'll end up with a closed economy where only the top X% of the users can really participate. And X will be decreasing when more players come in.<p>* Give a certain amount of points each day to spend on votes. (I'm not a user of that site, but I believe Slashdot uses it. Is that correct?) This will make upvotes a scarce resource, making people be more careful what they upvote. Of course, if unused points get deleted at the end of the day, people may try to spend unused points on things they wouldn't normally upvote.<p>* Up the current karma-limits. Right now you need X karma for feature Y, but with the influx of new users, karma has inflated somewhat. It's much easier to get to X if 10 people read your posts than it would be if only 1 person read it.<p>Just a few things of the top of my head. I'm not the smartest guy here, so it may not be a whole lot, though...",1257973967

I have strong opinions that many of the upvotes on the front page come from new people who are using it as a bookmarking feature and not a bestowment of karma to a good post.",1257973935

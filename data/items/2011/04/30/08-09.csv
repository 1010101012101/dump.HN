He took advantage of the situation to push an issue his employers were not aware that he was pursuing which then put them and all of their other employees and their contract with Google in a tenuous position.

2500239,comment,2499963,2499963,5,0,iuguy,,,"I think the title was poorly chosen.<p>Is the technical book dead? Well, it's declining but I wouldn't say dead yet. The problem with the market for technical books is that there are tons of them. Everywhere. Some are good, many are bad and there are a few 'classics' (Knuth, Stephens etc.). I think the problem with technical books (in our spheres) is that they don't integrate with the reader's workflow. The reader is often at a computer when reading a programming book. Switching between the computer screen and book page can be mentally expensive compared to having it open on the screen next to you. The pirated versions of books (particularly epubs) tend to be better indexed, can be copied and pasted and more easily integrated into your daily life. These are the challenges that technical books face. The pirated versions often provide a better user experience. It's the same (or rather similar) with DVDs.<p>Now taking that a little further to the title. The book (in general) is not dead, very far from it. I took an ereader on holiday last year and read through about 12 books in 4 days. It was the only piece of tech that I took (I like to unplug). It doesn't feel the same, but as with comparing FLACs to Vinyl the experience makes up for it in it's accessibility. Having said that, I still prefer to read books where I can. Having a Star Trek TNG style reading experience is great, but having the paperware feels an irrationally superior experience.",1304152889

This is to avoid situations where some random employee says something unintentionally stupid and it gets promoted to the top of all the sites as official company line. Or to prevent things like, you know, everyone claiming that ""Wozniak wants to return to Apple, if they ask him!"" when he never said any such thing.<p>Additionally, you're supposed to report anyone suspicious on the campus, whether they're trying to coat-tail into the building after you badge-in or whether they're snooping around outside and asking questions.<p>Imagine you hire a big pool of people who punch in a bunch of 10 key or flip pages on a book and press ""SCAN"" on the machine all day and someone comes snooping around to ask questions about a project (the digitizing of books) that is currently in litigation and some random jackass employee mouths off about something they haven't the slightest clue about and now it's headline news on all the tech industry rags?<p>Anyway, it's not peculiar or unusual practice. Its' very common. And from what I've seen, this is <i>all</i> speculation. And not even by an employee (or journalist). It's all speculation by a guy who was hired by a company who was hired by Google to get some footage who didn't like the racial makeup of the people he saw walking out of the building for a few days and then started to ask questions of employees who don't know him from any other random guy on the campus filming stuff and asking strange questions.<p>The way the accusation is made and the whole ""expose"" is presented is just absurd. Almost surreal, it's so silly. I can't help but think of it in the same light as the internet meme from a couple years ago, where some guys used Glenn Beck's techniques against him by starting up the website ""glennbeckrapedandmurderedayounggirlin1990.com"" and then posted the following:<p><i>""This site exists to try and help examine the vicious rumor that Glenn Beck raped and murdered a young girl in 1990. Why won't Glenn Beck deny these allegations?""</i><p>Except, in this case, it's <i>""This video exists to try and help examine the vicious rumor that Google is classist and racist and abuses its employees.

There was no clear guideline on Lucene integration at the time.<p>How is your experience with Neo4J? Do you have to sync Neo4J data with traditional databases like M$ SQL?<p>Do you want to make your project as community efforts or see it as potential business?<p>The last question is much more important.

Imagine yourself writing &quot;time&quot; every time you need to write it in a formula in the course of a working on a problem. Just expand the following expression (time + 2)(2time - 3)(4time + 5) by hand, writing &quot;time&quot; every time. Or imagine studying vector calculus and writing out the formulas with the long names like &quot;grad&quot;, &quot;curl&quot;, etc. That kind of notation was replaces with the nabla symbol and overloaded notation for a very good reason.<p>Also, most derivations, for simple formulas even, go through larger complexities before they converge to something slick.

It is a fascinating book in itself and borrows heavily from another book of same title written by Gandhiji&#x27;s disciple Dharampaal.<p>Beside the third book is a comprehensive survey of all caste related laws, judgements and  British Census reports in India and shows pretty big holes in &quot;discrimination&quot; and &quot;privilege&quot; arguments.<p>Here is the essay by Dharampal who notes the British Census in one of the provinces (Madras).

They are objective in a sense\nthat if two people agree on underlying principles of how priors should be\nassigned, then they will get the same priors. Catch is that you must decide\nwhat principles to use, as they are not objective themselves.<p>Updating multiple times on the same evidence can be bad - as it overstates\nevidence you have for some hypothesis - but you could do much worse. Instead of\ndiscovering that H implies E, suppose instead that you conditioned on H, which\nas later turned out is logically inconsistent. This is in general serious\nmistake regardless if what you are doing have word &quot;frequentist&quot; or &quot;Bayes&quot;\nattached to it, but consequences are not necessarily always the same. Larry\nWasserman in chapter titled &quot;Strengths and Weaknesses of Bayesian Inference&quot; of\nhis &quot;All of Statistics&quot; have an example concerned with estimating a normalizing\nconstant. He compares the two approaches, frequentist one which works just\nfine, and Bayes one which fails miserably. There is no additional commentary so\nI always wondered if he never realized that derivation makes inconsistent\nassumptions, or he realized that but intended to show that frequentist comes\nout just fine.

I think it is to great\ndetriment for mathematics and statistics, that people come up with catch names\nwith word &quot;paradox&quot; in it, for things that are merely unintuitive to them. For\nexample Simpson&#x27;s paradox is a simple observation that: probability of an\nevent, is not a simple average of event probability across all groups, instead\nthose within group event probabilities should be also weighted by relative\ngroup sizes. Whats paradoxical about that?<p>Regarding negation of H, not being a real hypothesis -- this is only true if\nyou claim that you somehow consider all alternative hypotheses. I don&#x27;t think\npeople claim that. I seems to me that it is rather taken to represent only\nthose alternative hypothesis that are under consideration given your modeling\nassumptions. Then it is perfectly fine and valid. I like how Jaynes avoided this\nkind of misinterpretations by conditioning everything on background information\nused and other assumptions.

10962012,comment,10957315,10957315,0,0,dkbrk,,,"I have yet to see any convincing criticism of Bayesian reasoning when performed using priors derived from the Principle of Maximum Entropy [0]. By incorporating all information available and nothing more, such a prior neither makes unwarranted assumptions nor throws away information (as is very commonly done with other methods). In principle the process of generating such a prior demands absolutely no subjectivity, rather it it the result of a logical deduction from all information available. In practice some information may be difficult to specify or incorporate, however this is automatically accounted for by the Principle of Maximum Entropy as it guarantees that nothing is assumed that is unspecified and being unable to incorporate some information will merely result in all possibilities being considered without bias. In the very worst case when you have no relevant information which can be incorporated this regresses to an uninformative prior (such as the uniform distribution) which are easily and rigourously handled by this principle even in far more complex cases where other approaches fail entirely. Furthermore, given a different prior this process can tell you exactly what additional (unwarranted) assumptions are made.<p>Once the priors are specified, the actual process of Bayesian Reasoning is formal logical reasoning generalised to the case when you possess incomplete information. It tells you exactly the degree of belief you can assign to a proposition given some information; and given this information assigning either less or more belief than the precise amount this deductive process tells you are equally grave mistakes.<p>For further information on the Principle of Maximum Entropy I recommend reading Prior Probabilities (1968) [1] and chapters 11 and 12 of Probability Theory: The Logic of Science [2]. If you are unconvinced of the theoretical validity or universality of Bayesian reasoning I heartily recommend reading chapters 1 and 2 of Probability Theory: The Logic of Science [2].<p>[0]: <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_maximum_entropy"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_maximum_entropy</a>\n[1]: <a href=""http://bayes.wustl.edu/etj/articles/prior.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://bayes.wustl.edu/etj/articles/prior.pdf</a>\n[2]: <a href=""http://bayes.wustl.edu/etj/prob/book.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://bayes.wustl.edu/etj/prob/book.pdf</a>",1453626653

10962003,comment,10960753,10961782,0,0,jordwalke,,,"Here are some things that make ML (and OCaml in particular) a desirable language for mobile development.<p>1. Sound, static typing prevents entire classes of errors. This becomes even more important when you are shipping an irrevocable binary to users which you cannot update after the fact.<p>2. That same static typing can prove safe the removal of data boxing, and run-time lookup in order to increase performance.<p>3. OCaml (`ocamlopt`) does not run your program in a &quot;Virtual Machine&quot; like Java - instead it compiles your code more directly into machine code like C++. Many (but not all) of the other functional languages compilers produce a byte code, and then rely on a JITed Virtual Machine to (hopefully) optimize your code at runtime. `ocamlopt` compiles your program into assembly and you can inspect that assembly ahead of time in order to understand how it will perform. There&#x27;s always tradeoffs with this approach, but the benefit is that you do not need to wait for (or hope for) a JIT to optimize your code (or re-optimize your code when usage patterns change).<p>4. OCaml is strict (as opposed to lazy), fairly close to the metal, and maps to lower level instructions in a fairly straightforward way - you would not be very surprised if you were to inspect the assembly. OCaml also has two ways to create bindings to C code. One way is easy and automated, the other way has better performance.<p>5. OCaml has a reputation for being able to allocate tons of memory at an impressive rate. To the extent that is true (and I&#x27;ve not yet observed anything to the contrary) I would imagine that would make it well suited to building UIs that are rapidly re-rendered.<p>6. OCaml has an Objects type system extension which makes it easier to create bindings to platform APIs (which tend to follow an OO design).<p>7. OCaml has two compiler modes: `ocamlc` and `ocamlopt`. Both support separate compilation, which is indispensable when building UI applications, where tweaking/reloading is very common. `ocamlc` would be ideal for that rapid development phase because, although it produces slower programs, it compiles them significantly faster. `ocamlopt` is ideal for shipping because it produces faster executables.<p>8. OCaml does not require that you write only pure programs. This makes it much easier to integrate with existing platform/mobile code which is also typically not pure.",1453626364

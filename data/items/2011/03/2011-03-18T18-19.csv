That is because a tsunami (or tidal wave) is generated by a <i>subduction</i> fault where one plate is sliding over or under the other. When tension is released there is a sudden change in relative altitude on either side of the fault, that if it occurs under water results in lifting up (or dropping) a large mass of water.<p>California has <i>strike/slip</i> faults, that is faults where two plates are moving past each other. They tend to create large horizontal dislocations along their fault rather than vertical dislocations. This does not result in massive water movement.<p>That isn't to say that its not possible, at some level all things are possible. But locally generated tidal waves (from a California fault) are even more rare than earthquakes of magnitude 8 or higher.<p>That being said, two things disaster planners can take away from the Japanese experience are; Storing more spent fuel in the pond than the pond is designed to hold is a huge deal, it should be on the inspection list, there should be mandatory fines if discovered and an immediate shutdown until the situation is corrected, and additional backup power options should be available, with infrastructure immune transport (aka helicopters), within a couple of hours.",1300472693

You know, I probably end up reading half the articles that appear on the Times's most popular list, and I enjoy them greatly. But if the Times just gave up on doing ""real"" reporting and focused instead on these kinds of ""popular"" topics -- well, I'm sure I'd pretty quickly lose interest in the publication and go find another source of news and interesting tidbits.<p>Which brings me back to CNN. I just have this feeling that this is what their business team was seduced by. Somebody looked at their numbers and said, ""Hey, we don't get nearly as many viewers when we run an in-depth expose on the state of women's education in Afganistan as we do when we broadcast Lindsay Lohan's court proceedings live. So let's just ditch that newsy stuff and focus on what our viewers really want.""<p>This strategy of following what's most popular probably works in the short run. But in the long run, it can be devastating to your brand if it comes at the expense of quality.",1300472659

I am looking for a Technical Co-Founder to share the load to make this happen. The service, Crumbs, is a location-based service that enables anyone to place notes in any place (not necessarily a business) in the world, thus leaving reviews, recommendations, experiences for others to see -- think of it as a Yelp/Facebook/Twitter of places. The service launched just a couple of weeks back, but we've had some previous good feedback from our alpha testers via TestFlight.<p>The app is currently out only for iPhone so it's Objective-C. The backend is done as Tomcat/Java Servlets (my forte) with almost the whole suite of AWS services (EC2, S3, RDS, SES), and Twilio (for invites via SMS). However, I am flexible on the technology for the next version. I'm considering HTML5 (for quick Android release), and could consider other backend technologies (my only requirements are extensive framework support and good scalability).<p>We made a couple of less-than-ideal product decisions that (I believe) have hindered the service's virality. Now that we have launched and have actual usage (we have solid app analytics in place), we can see this in perspective and that's what I am looking to correct in the next version.<p>Why I am a good co-founder for you: I am both business and tech. Not to brag, but I could probably go toe-to-toe with any technical guy out there. For Crumbs, I've written ~20K lines of objective-C (non-comments), and ~3K on the backend side. On the business side, I work - hard. I managed a team of part-time EECS students, contractors, got the website, and lined up committed angels (though not yet sufficient for a full angel round). For whatever it's worth, my resume looks good on paper (linkedin.com/in/wongjoh).<p>What I'm looking for:
- Objective-C and Java EE preferred. Potential for HTML5 and other backend technologies
- Good at hacking and at architecting (and knowing when to do what)
- Strong product and UI design sense
- Experience using social APIs (facebook/twitter)
- Location: San Francisco or East Bay based -- we have office space in SF Financial District (close to Embarcadero station) and in Berkeley (a co-working location)<p>Also to be clear, I'm not looking for a code monkey. I'm looking for a partner who can co-lead the technical side. Working in the same room is very important to me. You can discuss long-term direction one minute, then, draw a component diagram, and then pull up Xcode/Eclipse and start making it happen.<p>Why is this a great opportunity?: - I am offering up to 1/3 equity in the company (terms to be discussed) - The product is built, operational - A chance to take a project and help mold it into a success - Proven to obtain funding. Lastly, this is a very large market opportunity.<p>Interested in talking more??

I recently needed to print some new business cards before heading off to sxsw. My old ones were outdated in just 3 months (new startup, new google voice number, different title etc).

The reality is it's going to take a lot of money and especially time to cause the lock-in of Win-only apps to fully regress; it'd be a lot faster to work with it and cause almost everything to work perfectly on WINE. Office and .NET are the biggest hold-ups atm.<p>The problem with major investment in WINE is that as soon as MS thinks that suing CodeWeavers/any other WINE investors or distributors would be less harmful than allowing the project to continue without the extra attention, they're going to drop some big patent litigation all over that.

Unfortunately, we have people obsessed with how they look and what's going on in ""famous people's lives"", 90% of which is tabloid distortion or outright fabrication.<p>I blame marketing for this.  People are convinced they need stuff they don't really need, and the best way to do it is to say ""person you admire uses X"".  The reason CNN is sending all these people is they know it will make result in great ad revenue.<p><i>sigh</i>",1300471659

So far, our monetization works as follows:<p>- Someone is on our site getting out of debt, and we have a good picture of where they stand financially (their data).<p>- We know what Lending Club looks for in approving folks to get debt consolidation loans.<p>- We can run this user's data against what we know about Lending Club's model, and see if (A) they would be likely to qualify and (B) it would save them time or money. If these things turn up true, we recommend to the user that they go apply, showing them the data that led us to this recommendation.<p>- If they apply for and get a loan from Lending Club, we get a referral fee.<p>Up until the user decides to go apply for a loan, we have sent no data at all to Lending Club.<p>This kind of model is how we plan to approach the whole business. It's about giving people control over their financial situation and data, not taking it away. There are plenty of opportunities for us to profit with this model in an open, ethical, and transparent way, all the while keeping people in the driver's seat.",1300471538

Anyone relying on this when thinking about new laws deserves to have their constitutional rights slowly eroded year by year. Take Hong Kong as an example. Originally the idea universal suffrage would be applied in 2007. However due to less than ""reasonable"" readings of the law, the government now claims universal suffrage will apply in 2017. As of 2012 the government has performed zero actions in preparation for this.<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politics_of_Hong_Kong#Universal_suffrage"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politics_of_Hong_Kong#Universal...</a><p>The Hong Kong basic law stipulates the ultimate goal is universal suffrage, but every action until now by the government indicates it desires the delaying of this indefinitely.<p>Hong Kong was promised 50 years of autonomy, but after 10 years interference from the Chinese government has only increased. Why is the biggest and most funded political party in Hong Kong backed by the Chinese government?<p>See, you can only expect ""a reasonable reading of the law"" in reasonable times. When times are unreasonable the laws must be bullet-proof to be able to protect citizens.<p>When the average bill blows out to a thousand pages, it is in no way ""bullet-proof"".",1326955689

If corporate political speech were unprotected, then Congress could have outlawed the SOPA protests by reddit, Google, and other corporations.  Do you not feel that this would constitute an abridgement of the rights of the people behind reddit and Google to help inform the public about the nature of these bills?<p>If a group of individuals can join together and form a corporation to publish a book on almost any subject, but are specially prohibited from publishing a book endorsing or opposing a candidate or bill, then it seems to me that such a prohibition would clearly be an unlawful violation of the First Amendment, because it discriminates against certain speech based on the content of that speech.",1326955677

My company (Malwarebytes) has very irregular traffic (at the hour mark we get very big spikes, but only for a couple of minutes) and it seems like we would have to provision (for this specific app) that peak for the entire hour. I might be misunderstanding the billing for this service though- if we ask for more units for 15 minutes, would the billing be prorated?<p>This actually hits on my only real issue with AWS in general, which is the hourly billing. We've used the mapreduce service a bit, and having a cluster roll up and fail on the first job is heartbreaking when it has a hundred machine hours associated with it. Obviously that is far, far cheaper than us building out our own cluster (especially with spot instances, which I can't even describe how much I love), but for some of the services smaller billing times would be useful.",1326955259

You can do a range query within records that have the same hash attribute.<p>It would obviously be untenable if they spread records with the same hash attribute across many servers. You'd have a scatter-gather issue.

Consequently, if you store too many documents with the same hash attribute, wouldn't you overburden that subset of servers, and thus see performance degradation?<p>Azure has similar functionality for their table service, requiring a partition key, and they explicitly say that there is a throughput limit for records with the same partition key.

PRESS RELEASE, FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE.<p>Over a century ago Thomas Edison got the patent for a device which would ""do for the eye what the phonograph does for
the ear"". He called it the Kinetoscope. He was not only amongst the first to record video, he was also the first person
to own the copyright to a motion picture.<p>Because of Edisons patents for the motion pictures it was close to financially impossible to create motion pictures
in the North american east coast. The movie studios therefor relocated to California, and founded what we today call
Hollywood. The reason was mostly because there was no patent.
There was also no copyright to speak of, so the studios could copy old stories and make movies out of them - like
Fantasia, one of Disneys biggest hits ever.<p>So, the whole basis of this industry, that today is screaming about losing control over immaterial rights, is that they
circumvented immaterial rights. They copied (or put in their terminology: ""stole"") other peoples creative works,
without paying for it. They did it in order to make a huge profit. Today, they're all successful and most of the
studios are on the Fortune 500 list of the richest companies in the world. Congratulations - it's all based on being
able to re-use other peoples creative works. And today they hold the rights to what other people create.
If you want to get something released, you have to abide to their rules. The ones they created after circumventing
other peoples rules.<p>The reason they are always complainting about ""pirates"" today is simple. We've done what they did. We circumvented the
rules they created and created our own. We crushed their monopoly by giving people something more efficient. We allow
people to have direct communication between eachother, circumventing the profitable middle man, that in some cases take
over 107% of the profits (yes, you pay to work for them).
It's all based on the fact that we're competition.
We've proven that their existance in their current form is no longer needed. We're just better than they are.<p>And the funny part is that our rules are very similar to the founding ideas of the USA. We fight for freedom of speech.
We see all people as equal. We believe that the public, not the elite, should rule the nation. We believe that laws
should be created to serve the public, not the rich corporations.<p>The Pirate Bay is truly an international community. The team is spread all over the globe - but we've stayed out of the
USA. We have Swedish roots and a swedish friend said this:
The word SOPA means ""trash"" in Swedish. The word PIPA means ""a pipe"" in Swedish. This is of course not a coincidence.
They want to make the internet inte a one way pipe, with them at the top, shoving trash through the pipe down to the
rest of us obedient consumers. 
The public opinion on this matter is clear. Ask anyone on the street and you'll learn that noone wants to be fed with
trash. Why the US government want the american people to be fed with trash is beyond our imagination but we hope that
you will stop them, before we all drown.<p>SOPA can't do anything to stop TPB. Worst case we'll change top level domain from our current .org to one of the
hundreds of other names that we already also use. In countries where TPB is blocked, China and Saudi Arabia springs to
mind, they block hundreds of our domain names. And did it work? Not really.
To fix the ""problem of piracy"" one should go to the source of the problem. The entertainment industry say they're
creating ""culture"" but what they really do is stuff like selling overpriced plushy dolls and making 11 year old girls
become anorexic. Either from working in the factories that creates the dolls for basically no salary or by watching
movies and tv shows that make them think that they're fat.<p>In the great Sid Meiers computer game Civilization you can build Wonders of the world. One of the most powerful ones
is Hollywood. With that you control all culture and media in the world. Rupert Murdoch was happy with MySpace and had
no problems with their own piracy until it failed. Now he's complainting that Google is the biggest source of piracy
in the world - because he's jealous. He wants to retain his mind control over people and clearly you'd get a more
honest view of things on Wikipedia and Google than on Fox News.<p>Some facts (years, dates) are probably wrong in this press release. The reason is that we can't access this information
when Wikipedia is blacked out. Because of pressure from our failing competitors. We're sorry for that.<p>THE PIRATE BAY, (K)2012",1326953385

There are millions of artists who have changed the world and have made little to no money off their inventions. On the other hand there are many who have also made little contribution to the world, but profit hugely from incredibly meagre creations  (often off the back of other, real inventions).",1326952922

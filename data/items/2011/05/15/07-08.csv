2549521,comment,2549349,2549458,33,0,melvinram,,,"Great article. Here's a summary (or at least how I understood it) for those that don't read it (which I recommend you do):<p>* Mitochondrias (an organele in our cells that is considered the battery of a cell) in cancer patients typically don't function as they normally should.<p>* In 2007, University of Alberta researchers led by Evangelos Michelakis, announced a non-human trial that showed promising signs of stopping and regressing cancer using a substance known as DMC.<p>* DMC is thought to work by fixing bad mitochondrias in cancer patients (obviously over simplified).<p>* DMC is non-patentable and is easily made, so the news became a big anti-big-pharma story and spread like wild fire because the researchers were having trouble getting funds for doing clinical trials, since there was no money that could be made from this drug if it proved to work.<p>* The hopes for many cancer patients skyrocketed creating demand for DMC.<p>* A few ethically challenged entrepreneurs setup websites to sell DMC under the guise of DMC for Pets to get around FDA.<p>* There are potential side-effects when DMC is mixed with other drugs so a lot of people put their their lives in danger by doing self treatment, but no results were ever posted to the forums. The suspected reason is that the forum admins removed all negative reports.<p>* The websites were shut down by FDA after some time.<p>* A couple days ago, Michelakis's team at UofA announced the results of a clinical trial in which they administered DMC to 5 patients. This published in a journal but you can see their announcement at <a href=""http://www.dca.med.ualberta.ca/Home/Updates/2010-05-12_Update.cfm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.dca.med.ualberta.ca/Home/Updates/2010-05-12_Updat...</a><p>* Of the 5, patient #1, #2 & #5 showed promising results. Patient #3 died (not attributed to DMC) and patient #4 needed a 2nd surgery 3 months after starting, which it didn't specifically say but I assumed to mean that it wasn't considered successful.<p>* Key things to note:<p><pre><code>  - the trials where a combination of phase 0 \n    and phase 1 trials. \n\n  -- Phase 0 = seek to determine if the drug \n     is doing biochemically what it is expected \n     to do based on preclinical studies, usually \n     by taking a biopsy and doing chemical tests.\n  \n  -- Phase 1 ""are designed to determine two things: \n     dose and dose-limiting side effects"" ... \n     not efficacy of the drug.\n\n  - all 5 were treated differently and in \n    combination with other treatments. \n    This makes the tests not reliable \n    enough to make conclusions from. \n\n  - Treatments often show very very promising \n    signs when dealing with non-humans but fail \n    when the rubber meets the road in real \n    clinical trials.\n  \n  - DMC shows promise but it's dangerous for \n    people to self-treat and inefficient to \n    shortcut the scientific process of testing \n    and evaluating treatments.</code></pre>",1305444447

This optimization is possible because according to ANSI C, a variable is allowed to point to an address anywhere within an object, or at most one (sizeof) past an object. Anything else is undefined behavior (what they refer to as as ""illegal pointer"" in the post).<p>Therefore, buffer through buffer+1 would be valid pointers, but unless they can prove that i-128 is <=1 they can safely assume that the final pointer can be more than 1 past the buffer.<p>If it was just a pointer (not an array) they could do the same analysis if the pointer was mallocced right then in the same function with a constant size. More likely though, the pointer would be a function argument and then they would not know where the object boundaries were without doing interprocedural analysis (which I assume is outside of the scope of this post) and some other additional propagation (so technically within the C99 spec, but I doubt you would see an optimization that actually would do that).",1305444287

A database is a very specific thing, and the typical usage of the database (e.g. SELECT * FROM products WHERE id=?) can be very highly optimized.<p>A programming language or framework is much more general, and it is much harder to optimize common cases without losing layers of abstraction.<p>For example, it would be much faster to return records as arrays instead of ActiveRecord objects. That would probably be much better for certain uses — say, processing of lots and lots of records. It would be worse for most cases, though, and would make Rails that much harder to use.<p>This is probably exacerbated by the tendency to do everything in the application instead of in the DB (e.g. not using hand built SQL to get aggregate information). That said, it seems like there's been some movement toward shifting some processing back into the DB (e.g. joins).",1305443933

As a general rule, though, Card's novels aren't very quotable, and when they are, the quote is closely tied to the plot. If you didn't know how it related to Ender's development as a tactician and thinker, ""The enemy's gate is down"" wouldn't be a very impressive line. Meanwhile, Gibson throws off eye-popping lines every other page. Compare these two examples:<p>""Knocking him down won the first fight. I wanted to win all the next ones, too."" - Ender's Game<p>If you don't know what Ender is referring to, this quote loses almost all of its power. If you've read the story, though, this line is killer.<p>""The Sprawl was a long strange way home over the Pacific now, and he was no console man, no cyberspace cowboy. Just another hustler, trying to make it through. But the dreams came on in the Japanese night like livewire voodoo, and he'd cry for it, cry in his sleep, and wake alone in the dark, curled in his capsule in some coffin hotel, his hands clawed into the bedslab, temperfoam bunched between his fingers, trying to reach the console that wasn't there."" - Neuromancer<p>You don't need to have read the novel to appreciate the quote. Beyond the novelty and aesthetic beauty of the writing, it's very information-dense: You can get an excellent sense of the novel's setting, themes, conflict, and main character just from these three sentences.",1338317720

You can choose to make <i>your</i> point in life to reproduce, but that does not make other choices of point in life any less valid or real.<p>BTW, that's a quite smug attitude, no doubt shared by many people, but I personally do not consider reproduction a worthy goal in life or indeed an accomplishment at all. Raising a child well, yes. Getting your sperm in an egg or getting sperm in your eggs, no. To further elevate the life goal of reproduction to the only worthy life goal for humankind to the point of considering people who do not reproduce to be lifeless borders on the ridiculous (not to mention disrespectful to people who can't have children, or for whom its hard (gay people, for example), or people who simply choose not to have children).",1338317713

4039043,comment,4031035,4031035,4,0,j2labs,,,"Regarding design choices, I think Brubeck and Diesel are indeed the future. They don't rely on the broken ideas found in WSGI and they don't attempt to bolt on concurrency. Both are designed around an async / nonblocking system that removes the horrible callbacks found in Node.js, Twisted, Tornado and even provide a system for converting your blocking calls into nonblocking calls.<p>On top of that, the performance of these two, by being based in gevent, blows the other systems out of the water. Tornado and Twisted are both slower due to so much of the core loop being written in Python instead of C. Here is a simple hello world comparison of Brubeck vs. Tornado: <a href=""https://gist.github.com/2252671"" rel=""nofollow"">https://gist.github.com/2252671</a> - What we see is that at it's base level, meaning there's no I/O or CPU bound tasks, gevent is straight-up much faster.<p>Regarding features, Brubeck can already generate a REST API for you, provides auth hooks, has oauth plugins, supports the template systems you care about, works great with mongo, riak, redis, postgres, mysql, all with nonblocking support, and it even comes witha  modeling layer that won't force badly generated queries on you, aka databaseless schemas.<p>(As said in my other comment, I am biased due to being on Brubeck's core team)",1338317166

That means that the backlog is less a to-do list and more a things-I-am-definitely-not-doing-now list.<p>For me, every time I have one of those ""It would be nice"" thoughts, I write it down on a card for the kanban, throw it in the backlog, and forget it until the next time I make a prioritization pass.

We've always wanted two, and it's been such a wonderful experience that we want more of. So there's that.<p>On the other hand, the months of treatment after diagnosis were the most emotionally draining experience we've ever gone through, and we don't know if we have it in us to go for number two. We're still in the early days (diagnosis + 9 months, all signs pointing to cured) so this may change, but active parenting causes healing and recovery to happen much slower.<p>My wife (and her brother) are also both adopted, so we're well aware of the dynamics involved there. We've said since before we started trying for kids that we weren't going to beat ourselves up if we'd had problems conceiving (we gave ourselves nine months of trying before we'd look at adoption. As it turns out it only took us one). One could probably argue that the truly optimal thing to do would have been to forego trying biologically at all and to jump right into adoption, but that didn't feel right either.<p>All of which is to say that I don't think it's egocentricity per se, but a natural desire to at least <i>try</i> and see your genes successfully expressed in the world. While that's not ideal from a rational perspective, I don't think you can go too far down that line of thinking without verging into eugenics.",1338317076

4038968,comment,4037447,4037831,6,0,earl,,,"1 - fb has the potential to be the first serious adsense competitor: slightly poorer context data (though they certainly can repeat much of the work google has done, and I bet bing would love to do a data deal with them) but much better data about the user.  Adsense earns roughly $10B/ year; ex my quick guess at tac (23% from 2009q4) and adsense makes $7.7B/year net.  FB stands to take a bunch of that if they wish.  They still are trying to invent new types of social advertising, and it would certainly be weird if facebook.com was just a giant data honeypot, but they have the data and the technical ability.  And the demand from pubs is certainly there: pubs love anyone who pays them.<p>2 - anybody citing GM pulling $10M in annual spend is an idiot, unless you think GM is in the business of sending out press releases announcing all of their advertising budget changes.  No?  Then there's something else going on here; perhaps some bare-knuckled negotiation tactics.<p>3 - fb collects a tax on gaming.  Plus Zynga and some others may be cleared to start doing online poker for real money [1].  fb taxes that at 30%.<p>4 - low ctr is fine for direct response as long as you have proportionally low costs.  What this does for the user experience is another question =P<p>5 - lots of people in adtech very much want Google not to win everything.  See the rise of the ABG (anybody but google) exchange: appnexus + aol + microsoft [2].  I expect yahoo inventory to start showing up there once yahoo realizes they no longer have the technical ability to run an ad exchange.  Scott talking about selling off rmx can't have helped retain technical talent, and at this point it's a fat question why anyone would want it.  Yahoo will sell a bunch of guaranteed delivery, but I think a bunch of the rest will show up on appnexus eventually, if it isn't already there blind.<p>5a - contributing to the above, hopefully google will get investigated for antitrust.  For starters, hiding search query terms in the referrer string should trigger an investigation.  They use that data in adsense, and it's particularly valuable for targeting ads on low text pages.  Now they're hiding that from other ad networks, I can't find any public statement guaranteeing they're not letting adsense see it.  Google also uses search query results to juice display retargeting.<p>6 - ctr isn't particularly important for brand advertisers.  There is a growing disparity of the ratios of ad spend / time spent in different media, with TV higher.  Thus behind some of fb's valuation is the thesis that brand advertising dollars will be moving from tv to online, and fb is probably poised to take a big chunk of those.  If/when this happens is unknown, but winning bets on those sorts of things is how investors get paid.<p>7 - fb may still be given a giant present from the EU depending on just how their anti cookie laws work in practice.  The morons in GB rolled it all back 24h before the implementation deadline, but other member states may go all in and more or less ban 3rd party cookies.  Then we'll be stuck in a tagless world, and I bet fb will get an enormous amount of spend.<p>[1] <a href=""http://venturebeat.com/2012/01/20/the-deanbeat-should-zynga-move-into-online-gambling/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://venturebeat.com/2012/01/20/the-deanbeat-should-zynga-...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.adweek.com/news/technology/aol-make-inventory-available-yahoo-s-right-media-exchange-137958"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.adweek.com/news/technology/aol-make-inventory-ava...</a>",1338316509

Do you have any evidence to support that?  Because my experience working with a game that had about 1MM DAUs at its peak was completely different.  The analysis wasn't perfect, because it's very difficult to <i>prove</i> there is no unique user on the other end.  But there are behavioral queues. And we determined that 1/4 to 1/3 of the accounts playing our game were fake.<p>Have you spent much time playing these games?  They're hyper competitive.  So any mechanics which require or benefit a player by having more friends will be taken advantage of.  Need 20 friends to advance past a level?  It's far easier to make and use 20 Facebook accounts accounts than it is to spam your friends list for people to play, especially if no one on your list actually plays the game.  The whole system was designed to <i>promote</i> this sort of activity.  That's why I can't understand why people would be shocked at this.  The ruse is good for users (more stuff!), good for the games and good for Facebook (more DAUs!).<p>Again, it's the industry's dirty little secret: nobody has any incentive to tell people that large numbers of people using their game or application aren't even real.  That goes for Facebook, Zynga or any small gaming shop anywhere.<p>Look at companies like this:<p><a href=""http://www.buyilikes.com/20000-likes/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.buyilikes.com/20000-likes/</a><p>Do you think that they rally 20,000 people to ""like"" your page?

Either way, the data advertisers are using to determine spends and ROI is skewed in an undetermined direction.<p>Edit:  Have you ever played World of Warcraft?  Do you know how people use characters to store and transfer goods?  Depending on the Facebook game, that principle can exist on a very large scale.

Much as Microsoft felt they had to get into search to compete against Google (they still don't compete in a meaningful way), Facebook feels they have to compete in the mobile space, but will never be able to execute as well as Apple on hardware or Google on integration with web services. It's very hard to get right, and I doubt very much they have the product design talent and supply chain experience to pull it off consistently and long-term, and it is way off their main area of competence. I'd be very surprised if they do well with a mobile platform given all the challenges it presents - they should work on improving their offerings on the main platforms instead, otherwise they will have 4 Facebook app binaries instead of 3 to maintain, and no obvious advantage as most of the users will not be on their phone.<p>Mobile is a complement to other devices, and a way of accessing the web, it is not a new segment which is orthogonal to web use - I'd argue mobile has only become popular as handsets became capable of accessing the web fully, and mobile apps may or may not win out over websites for some services, but for websites like Facebook they offer no real advantages save more access to user hardware for uploading pics etc. - something that a website can offer with an API and third party apps. Mobile apps are of course competing with the desktop, and will continue to do so, but not really with websites, they usually complement websites and use their APIs, not replace them.<p>Facebook's real problem, and real competitor, is the open web.<p>Facebook has been opposed to opening up from the beginning, and has pursued a very successful strategy of corralling their users, and requiring anyone who wants to interact with the service to sign in and share their info - I'm constantly plagued by their login messages when I visit a page. At some point this walled garden is going to start feeling very restrictive - it only works if there is a continually growing, or at least not shrinking, pool of people using the service - if it feels like everyone is logged in all the time, otherwise it becomes a bit of an echo chamber, infested with spambots and spammy companies like Zynga, and if your friends don't bother to check it any more or post, what's the point?<p>I suspect as the gloss wears off Facebook, particularly if they make a foray into mobile and waste energy there, it will be harder and harder to keep users inside their bounded version of the web, and competitors without the barrier to entry for readers (sign-in required for all essential services), will come in and capture user interest, as pinterest has for example.<p>As to their stock price, given their current revenue/profits and potential future profits, I'm astounded anyone still believes it was worth > $20B in today's money.",1338315885

You are entitled to your personal view as well. But you could recognize consideration of the issue as a good thing and the disagreement as normal and healthy. Instead, you are calling people terrible names and picking on grammar, without provocation. Please don't continue in that vein.<p>I think for most people, you are right that having a kid is a fulfilling thing. I am personally glad that someone is having kids (particularly if they are doing a good and thoughtful job of caring for them). But the implication that no one with kids could ever disagree with you is not correct - though it is unlikely that they will bother to do so in public. I have talked to several people who do regret having kids (particularly in a certain time or situation) but they are not so likely to say it - both because of the kind of aggressive reply you have given but maybe also because they are likely to be wrongly taken as saying that they do not love their children, or that they wish the child did not exist. A person can believe that having kids is not necessarily altruistic, or that there is no moral or practical imperative to have kids, without being an awful arrogant psychopath.<p>Before you have a child, there is no child to wish the nonexistence of. And since it is an irreversible long-term decision, you should definitely think about the pros and cons in a rational way. Many people do come to parenthood by a reasonable, conscious choice and that is a blessing. Other people decide not to. If that is in their best interests then good for them. Perhaps there will be a future time where it does make sense to have kids. Leave them be. It's a personal decision, not a moral necessity.<p>Not everyone has to get married, either; not getting married doesn't make you a psychopath or a pathetic unfulfilled person, even if it's a nice thing and a great life work for many people.",1338315671

Then you need to take care of your relationship because that's a prerequisite for a working family of two parents and one or more kids.

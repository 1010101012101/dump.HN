It's not an insult so don't get bent out of shape. This isn't me being rude, it's you being hypersensitive.<p>I'm not saying your child - Timmy, age 6, blonde, missing tooth, slight lisp - personally is a worthless being.

3054471,comment,3053645,3053953,2,0,techiferous,,,"> No one is really truly happy, right?<p>""Happiness"" is multidimensional, so even describing it with one word is over-simplistic.  Our minds are very complex; they have different levels of consciousness, intelligence, and perceptions at the same time.  So one way I would describe ""happiness"" is to break it down like this:<p>*  Are you free from physical pain or discomfort?<p>*  Are your basic physical needs met (food, clothing, shelter, safety)?<p>*  Are you free of negative emotional states (fear, anger, sadness) and experiencing at least one positive emotional state (contentedness, excitement, laughter)?<p>*  Think about the ""stories"" of your life--what is currently happening to you and the goals you are following.  Do you anticipate happy endings?<p>*  How do you feel about the relationship with the world around you?  Do you fundamentally think you are a good person?  Do you fundamentally think the universe is a good, safe place?  Do you feel like your connection with the world around you is meaningful?<p>If you are fulfilled in all of these areas, you'll be and feel truly happy.  I've had times like that.  So yes, it's possible for people to be truly happy.<p>On the flip side, only one of those things have to be out of whack for us to feel unhappy, so that's why sometimes happiness can seem so elusive.<p>So that's my 2 cents.  And am I happy at the moment?  No. :)",1317332919

3054384,comment,3054235,3054235,2,0,makecheck,,,"Even if you've done C++ before and want to target mobile, I'd still recommend starting with a forgiving language such as Python.  Python is simple so you can be immediately productive.  It has lots of documentation, it's easy to search the web for examples and even if you won't use it for mobile it will remain a valuable skill.<p>Mastering a simple language can also be like the first 50% of your goal.  While Python is not exactly the same as something like Objective-C, it has many of the same concepts (classes, containers, C-like language features, etc.).  You will quickly become comfortable with relatively complex programming tasks, and you won't be bogged down by tangential stuff like compiler errors, Interface Builder, simulators, or who knows what else.<p>Don't be afraid to start building things that you may not need yourself.  For example, you may have no reason to build an interactive shell that acts like a calculator, but it's a tiny project that would slowly introduce you to a few Python library functions and language constructs.  It's also pretty obvious if a calculator is behaving correctly.  When that works, you should ask yourself how you might <i>extend</i> it; for example, if you wanted the calculator to write its results to a file like an adding machine writes to paper, search the library for functions that deal with files and try to learn those too.  Do this for awhile until you have a few generations of the thing and you've learned a few diverse things.<p>Only then should you try to map what you know to a more powerful environment that is more closely aligned with a mobile platform.  You will find that once you're <i>very</i> confident in <i>one</i> language, a 2nd language such as Objective-C isn't too bad.  It's a lot of different syntax and a whole new standard library, but you will find both the language and the library to have similarities (e.g. you can teach yourself NSDictionary by remembering how Python dicts work, or NSArray by remembering Python list capabilities).  Yes, you still won't learn it overnight, but it will be easier than starting from scratch.<p>And since you have a working prototype in another language, you can then see what it would take to map this to the new environment.  For example, pull up a template project for the iPhone, and try to make a very basic calculator app by making buttons perform the actions you used to receive from the command line in the Python version.",1317331439

3054278,comment,3054235,3054235,1,0,saiko-chriskun,,,"Mobile development (in my experience) is generally a bit harder to get into that just standard web development. You could try something like PhoneGap or just plain web-friendly mobile development first to see if that works out well enough, but if you go native you'll have to fully learn Java / Objective-C (for the android and iphone, respectively.)<p>As for web development languages / frameworks that are beginner-friendly and well supported, I don't think there's much competition to Rails. However node.js has definitely been gaining momentum recently (would allow the entire app to be coded in javascript :P) and if you go that route definitely check out coffeescript (or even clojurescript, which is what I'm interested in, but that's more of a leap :P).<p>Personally I'm going to use my next personal side project to learn <a href=""http://chicagoboss.org"" rel=""nofollow"">http://chicagoboss.org</a> :P",1317330174

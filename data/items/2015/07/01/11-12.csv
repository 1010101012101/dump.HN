In the context of whether they&#x27;re allowed to use pool.ntp.org systemd is a product.<p>> Coreos should register its own product with the pool and use that. Systemd upstream is not a product, we shouldnt register it as one. distributions such as fedora have their own pool, debian has, ubuntu ha, arch hass. if downstream dont set the correct pool for their product then thats something to fix downstream.<p>Here he repeats the line that pools is forbidden:<p>> the ntp pool made very clear we cannot use them. As i read what is written above google just says the servers are crap but doesnt explicitly deny us to use them. Which is why id like to leave them in place because they are at least googd enough for testing purposes.<p>And here:<p>> We are an open source project, with no legal entity behind it and as such we are not the ones who can take responsibilty and not the ones who register as a vendor at the pool. [...] but right now the ntp pool is nothing we can use since the non-vendored pool is explicitly forbiddrn for us and the vendored pools dont apply to us since we arent a vendor.<p>He makes the claim several times in that thread.<p>But even if we accept that pools should not be used: that doesn&#x27;t mean you can use Google&#x27;s time servers.

Most (all?) beginner 3D programming tutorials start you off with making your own meshes by hand in code and leave loading models from files until far, far later. This, to me, is exactly backwards. The basics of modeling are not hard to teach, Blender is free, and building static, non-mathematically defined meshes in-code really sucks.<p>Your mileage may vary, but I wouldn&#x27;t necessarily say that modeling is easy, especially not trying to use Blender.  Most beginnner 3D programming tutorials use simple geometric shapes because it is a helluva lot easier to figure out if your lighting is off or your projections wrong when the scene objects are simple.  Loading complex models from file is not exactly a piece of cake, either - you either need a fully-featured library with support for models baked in, or to use something like Assimp, or even write your own model format parsers.",1435750467

His actual code quality is not so great. PulseAudio is still a mess a decade on, and I gave up even trying to figure out why it breaks because it&#x27;s a nightmare of misleading variable names and uncommented code. I finally abandoned hope when I tracked down a crash, found that a patch that was literally unfinished and labelled as such had made it into a release before being backed out, realised they don&#x27;t do stable releases and the next upstream release with the fix would have other major changes with new bugs, and eventually discovered that reverting it didn&#x27;t even fix the problem. The underlying code was simply broken and there was no way to see how it was ever meant to have worked in the first place, because it was completely uncommented.<p>systemd seems to have slightly better code, probably because it has kernel developers on the team, but like PulseAudio there are no stable releases. It&#x27;s up to individual distros to try and turn the stream of upstream releases into something that works. I think this is a Red Hat thing - they&#x27;re happy to develop new features collaboratively and in the open, but actually turning software into stable, reliable working releases is their secret sauce that people pay them big dollars for. They&#x27;re also the only major distro that doesn&#x27;t co-operate with the upstream Linux kernel&#x27;s process for stable and long-term releases.",1435750202

I beg to differ and actually agreee with this quote more and largely believe that the languages are unimportant.  It is more nuanced than that though and really depends on what you&#x27;re working on.<p>If you&#x27;re writing an app that&#x27;s going to be able to run on a single small vm, you might as well write everything in the language your developer is most comfortable in and will deliver fastest with.  If you have ten developers but 50,000 servers, you might want to pick a faster language, but the math is pretty simple, hosting costs vs development costs, what&#x27;s greater?<p>Of course it&#x27;s  more complicated than that, because your ops guy can make a meal of the scaling, your java developer can write slow code, and your PHP developer can write efficient code (within the constraints of the language, of course).<p>For me the general problems with hiring based on tech is if you go for the new and shiney, you&#x27;ll deal with people who&#x27;ll never finish anything, and if you go with old and reliable, you&#x27;ll get people who are slower because they aren&#x27;t following resonable practices.<p>Most companies just need someone who&#x27;ll deliver though, so there&#x27;s nothing wrong with them picking old reliable $foo for everything, and I&#x27;d suggest your good senior developer shouldn&#x27;t care about anything else than delivering, both long term and short, and if the advice is that everything needs to be rewritting in flavour of the month, I&#x27;d suggest said developer may be good, but they&#x27;re probably not mature enough to be senior.",1435748477

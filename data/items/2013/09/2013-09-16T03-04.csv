6391543,comment,6391388,6391388,21,0,adrianm,,,"I&#x27;ll throw my hat in here for learning Clojure. It&#x27;s a modern Lisp that runs on the JVM, with a great community and awesome libraries. (For example, <a href=""https://github.com/Engelberg/instaparse"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/Engelberg/instaparse</a>) As others have mentioned, it all comes down to what you really want to do. I use Clojure both professionally (for web development, statistical computing/analytics software, natural language processing) and for fun on a daily basis. It&#x27;s the only language I&#x27;ve yet to come across in my career that work doesn&#x27;t make boring. I relish every opportunity I get to code in Clojure, because after solving every problem in it I end up with a DSL (domain specific language) that I can extend and mold to the problem as I learn more about it, and honestly I find that addicting. I can&#x27;t recommend it enough, even if you just use it for fun occasionally. At worst, you&#x27;ll have learned a Lisp and can judge its merits for yourself. At best, you&#x27;ll experience what I have: infatuation that I hope never goes away. It&#x27;s been about a year now since I first learned it, and I probably code at least 3-4 hours a day in it. My love has not abated in the slightest, it has only increased. Give it a shot, you may like it!",1379303990

And this is sorta/kinda the point of the article, where you will do well at a technical interview if you know some tricks in programming, whether it be through academic study or just on-the-job stuff.<p>To find if two words are anagrams of each other, do this:<p>sort(word1) == sort(word2)<p>done.<p>The trick is knowing that an anagram has a signature, and that signature can be found if you sort a word&#x27;s characters alphabetically.  Then you do the same to the other word and compare both of their signatures together.  Voil.<p><pre><code>    &quot;genuine class&quot; == &quot;alec guinness&quot;
    because
    &quot;aceegilnnssu&quot; == &quot;aceegilnnssu&quot;
</code></pre>
In Ruby you&#x27;d write your own alphabetic sorting function first, then apply it to each word.<p><pre><code>    def sortAZ (word)
      word.downcase.unpack(&quot;c*&quot;).sort.pack(&quot;c*&quot;)
    end

    def is_anagram (word1, word2)
      sortAZ(word1) == sortAZ(word2)
    end

    puts &quot;is_anagram(ARGV[1], ARGV[2])&quot;
</code></pre>
I recall seeing this trick in a Ruby book (probably PickAxe or something) and thought it was cool because I had never thought about finding an anagram in this way.  Regardless, it stuck with me so, if this was asked in an interview, I&#x27;d be able to answer the question easily and look like a rockstar...when really it&#x27;s just knowledge that stuck with me.<p><i>By the way, the alphabetic sorting here is done by unpacking each character into its number representation and then sorting the resulting numbers.</i>",1379303455

When biodiesel fuel was once thought to be a promising source of energy a few years back, prices of food promptly shot up and this resulted in the poor having difficultly affording food.<p>Now, I am aware this makes for a tenuous argument if we&#x27;re talking about music, but I don&#x27;t think it is outright inapplicable. Consider not the one-off luxury item, consider items you expect mass public to consume in large quantities -- consider itunes, a highly scaled platform which can now just sit and take in money. Indeed itunes bears a responsibility by virtue of it being a highly scaled avenue to buy music from -- <i>unlike a local store which can only dream of seeing such business traffic</i>, to charge reasonable prices.

Every new piece of software can be broken down to pieces that are very similar to other software that had been done before. This is actually the secret to providing a good estimate.<p>What generally screws up estimates are complications that arise.

There&#x27;s no foreseable end-state to base an estimate on -- though there <i>are</i> terminating conditions we can use to end research (ran out of money, made amazing discovery that will be passed to engineers to commercialise, gathered sufficient data to write publishable paper etc).<p>Take the linked post&#x27;s example of AIDS research. How long will it take to cure AIDS? There is simply no way to know. We can produce estimates, but because it is a <i>research</i> problem, any such estimate would have to have wildly broad ranges to be accurate (&quot;somewhere between 10 and 100 years&quot;).<p>In cases of pure research, you can&#x27;t estimate the end-goal.

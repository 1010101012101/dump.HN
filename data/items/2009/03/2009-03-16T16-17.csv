Show some percentage of free users the new treatment (""premium, but for free"") and the remainder the old default (""like premium, but less of everything you care about"").  Then measure conversions.  If your ""premium, but for free"" users don't buy statistically significantly more domains (enough to offset the premium revenue), then you can abandon the test and your premium users never have to know you had a crisis of confidence in your business model.<p>Its easy to say.  Its hard to do, particularly with dynamic sites.  Google Website Optimizer is a halfway decent solution if you can get it to work.  I hope to have another halfway decent solution available for Rails users sometime in the not-too-distant future, as I'm sort of fed up with the GWO ""all tests incur 1.5~2 seconds of extra load time as we figure out what URL to redirect to, because that <i>totally</i> won't murder your conversions"" problem.",1237222752

I even wear them at home, they can cut out a lot of background noise as they clear a lot of the bass noise that tends to overpower other sounds.<p>I used to fly a lot and they worked amazing, it really helps when you don't hear the rumble of the engines.<p>The only problem with the HPNC300's is that they're on-ear headphones and as I wear quite thick-armed glasses once every few days the headphones just really pile on the pressure. If you don't wear glasses then I don't imagine you'd ever have a problem with on-ear, although personally I'm also looking for a good pair of circumaural (over-ear) but I don't really have a need to spend money on them now. When I got my current pair of headphones the price difference between noise canceling on-ear and over-ear was just shit stupid, it was like double-tipple the price for equal dB reduction through the noise canceling and not simply being a $400 pair of ear protectors with earphones built in.",1237220094

518328,comment,516829,517081,0,0,shader,,,"Unfortunately, I don't think that stimulating production or innovation is a good idea either.<p>When you just stimulate production, it is true that production will increase but not in a way the consumers actually want. The evidence for this is that production has been stimulated (along with consumption) for a long time due to artificially low interest rates. The housing boom is a boom in production of houses.<p>""booms"" in general are caused by the illusion that there are more savings than in reality exist - i.e. lowered interest rates, easy loans, etc. This causes the business to over invest, thinking there is enough in the way of resources to do so, and the consumer to consume more, thinking the same thing. Unfortunately, because the lower interest rate does not coincide with increased savings the businesses soon find out that there are not enough resources to complete their projects. This is when the boom starts to stagnate. In the late '90s, the scarce resource was programmers and IT employees, who were increasingly hard to find as businesses continued to hire them all for new internet projects.<p>Artificial stimulation is a very bad idea in either case, consumption or production. It is especially bad when you stimulate both at once.<p>However, I don't think you have to worry about innovation too much. Especially in this period of economic decline, people will be able able to innovate even without stimulation ;)",1237219496

I simply realised that the one thing I wanted to do in life was write, and that all the BS of school was transitory. That summer, at 16 I started working as a reviewer and was the first person at the company to get an excerpt on a product, however I left when the politics started interfering with the job. It was like, depending on who the product came from you had to add points to the review. It wasn't so much with movies, but with video games if one was coming from EA it was virtually impossible to badmouth. The final straw came with Oblivion, the preview material was so flawed the game was inherently unplayable without cheats (the whole, a rat can kill a lvl 30 thief because they stupidly made all the creatures level too).<p>After I left I switched from writing short stories to actually going for the goal posts with a novel. I've ditched a lot of projects, simply because I outgrew them in the process of writing them. I threw out an entire months work because it wasn't original enough for me, and from my experience humans have a very limited ability to see outside of the box when they're focusing on something so if I released it wasn't original then so would everyone else.<p>My honest advice to you is find someone with a valid opinion on writing (in my case it was my editor, who I became quick friends with) and get them to be <i>brutally</i> honest. Take every single word they say to heart and then feel free to ignore every fucking word if it doesn't help you. Do this with as many people you can trust and get them to be honest and if they don't provide criticism they're not helping.<p>People often avoid hearing the bad things about their work and people often avoid saying bad things about it, but you need to hear every single criticism no matter how irrelevant it actually ends up being. If it doesn't help you immediately, it will eventually because once you're published your work is open to the judgment of millions of people. It also helps with denials, lots of agents/editors can be helpful, but don't be surprised if you get a standard denial letter... I once got one when I emailed an agent asking what genres he was currently accepting submissions for, which was exceptionally funny.",1237219476

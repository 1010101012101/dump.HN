The protections are constantly updated, coming with new ways of triggers and other advanced protection measures in every version, making existing tools and approaches break. It's a neverending war, crackers versus copy protections.<p>As far as ripping and encoding goes, there is definitely some 'skill' involved as well (especially in video ripping/encoding and ensuring the best or 'right' quality and resolution) but in a lot of cases, it is the same steps and combination of tools each time. If we're talking audio ripping, it is basically a one-click thing. You can't compare this to the amount of skills, time and hard work required for cracking.<p>And although today's protections are much harder than most of what crackers in the old days had to deal with, it has always been like that.",1334973411

But there will be lots of sturm und drang before we get there.<p><a href=""http://assets.en.oreilly.com/1/event/31/The%20Cloud_s%20Hidden%20Lockin_%20Network%20Latency%20Presentation.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://assets.en.oreilly.com/1/event/31/The%20Cloud_s%20Hidd...</a><p><a href=""http://www.slideshare.net/sh1mmer/the-clouds-hidden-lockin-network-latency"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.slideshare.net/sh1mmer/the-clouds-hidden-lockin-n...</a><p>There were four separate things needed to bring about what we think of as the modern international mail system. First you needed better infrastructure inside and between countries. You needed literally more portable objects, envelopes with stamps on them, instead of loose sheets, scrolls, wax seals, etc. You also needed standardization of the rates and address formats so one letter can travel anywhere. Last was a uniform rate, no-questions-asked promise to deliver via optimized routes, what we would now call a ""peering agreement"". Two ends of the agreement would treat each other as peers, and honor each others' comminucations as they would their own.<p>It's that kind of system we don't have, but should, in the cloud.
We need better infrastructure in the form of optimized routes between clouds. We need to be able to move our virtual machines and configurations around without special help. We need to make sure we don't get locked-in by screwball APIs or data formats. Most of all, we need the various cloud and web services vendors to commit to honoring each other's traffic without clobbering us, their customers, with metered billing.",1334973374

Of course it should be the ones who give the orders who get canned. But noone gets canned.<p>The definition of tyranny is ""arbitrary or unrestrained exercise of power"".

It's superficial. It's an added bonus on top of <i>design</i>. Design, on the other hand, is the core of the product: how it functions. It's the soul: what story it tells.<p>Your redesign, while prettier, does nothing to improve the user experience, or to tell a story. Sure, it's easier on the eyes, but it's a much worse <i>design</i>, in that it makes the user experience worse. It's now <i>harder</i> to read: less information is on the screen. (11 story as opposed to 25, on my screen.) The information hierarchy within stories is less clear. The eye has to jump around more to get the secondary information (poster / point count / comment count / time posted). The flag functionality is simply gone<p>You did a good job making it look better, and should be commended for that. But as for the design, try again.<p>PS: Take this as friendly critique. Take it in, learn what you can, try again. Rise, repeat. Don't be discouraged, but realize you have a long way to go.

The name Verelo does not convey what your service does.<p>5. I think Pingdom's $10/month price point is about right for our use-case.  We'd probably drop it if they raised prices very much.<p>Hope this helps, good luck with your venture!",1334970152

Although it's also possible that:<p>* next-quarter results are ""less bad"" than expected, and the large band of short sellers have to start buying to cover<p>* insiders feel that the stock is unfairly priced and are willing to hold on until it improves<p>* Facebook's IPO is a roaring success and generates a rising tide for all internet stocks<p>I think the first one has the most chance of happening.  The stock is heavily shorted right now, any news that's not negative has the chance of sparking a rally.",1334970116

The reason I want to learn ruby on rails as oppose to PHP or Phython is because my friend/partner is more comfortable using ruby on rails. Therefore, in order to collaborate with him, I should learn ruby on rails. Having said all that, I would still like to hear your opinion on what language I should start on.. if you have one.

In particular, the distinction between making it work and making it right.<p>The reason for this style of thinking applies to projects that you don't really have a clear path on how to implement them. A good example would be building a humanoid robot. Along the way you learn what works and what doesn't and you end up with a project that works, sort of. Now that you have a better understanding of the problem you re-architect the entire project, if needed, to make it easier to maintain long term.<p>Of course, this is just a rule of thumb. You don't have to wait till the end to re-architect a project. You could treat each major sub-module as a project of its own and apply this same thinking.",1334970015

It's a ragged-right design, and it bugs the crap out of me (though it might just be me).<p>On the whole, I'd much rather be using that site than this one though, and that's gotta be the benchmark for success.

So I located the bug and realized it could be fixed by just increasing a constant in the binary.<p>The best part is that the relevant bit pattern turned out to be legible in ASCII. So this serious bug could be fixed by searching for something like &quot;.,&quot; and replacing it with &quot;.~&quot;. I taught the devops guys to do this in Notepad++. The DLL could even be reloaded without restarting the server. Problem solved!<p>When I left the company and wrote a little report about this, the architect patted me on the back and sighed deeply.

They didn&#x27;t tell me that almost none of the credits would apply to my degree because 4-year degrees have almost every single course planned - so I still have 4 years to go... Oh and the feds just made a law that says if you take to long your tuition doubles. So for about the last year of my college that&#x27;s $16k instead. Oh yeah, and we forgot.

But it&#x27;s not always. Reproducibility is a really tough problem when you support 25+ Linuxes, each with their own versions of GCC and libc, different compiler flags by default, etc. There&#x27;s some work being done to make this &quot;better&quot; like GNU ld&#x27;s build-id hashing binary sections so it&#x27;s easier to tell if they changed, and projects that stash the compiler&#x27;s flags in a binary section with -frecord-gcc-switches/-grecord-gcc-switches. But we&#x27;ve still got a long way to go, at least in the wonderfully fragmented landscape of Linux software development.<p>Furthermore, the example in the article is rather specious. Versioning is very often done by macros and string replacement and not some constant somewhere in a .section that&#x27;s easy to just &quot;lemme tweak this&quot; and push a new release. No, you&#x27;d have to go through the entire object file to find any place that version number is used.<p>It&#x27;s not the exceptional case in real world software with multiple supported releases that you see code like:<p><pre><code>    if (version_number == 2 || version_number == 3) {\n      do this thing; \n    } else if (version_number == 4) {\n      do that thing instead;\n    }\n</code></pre>\nor its equivalent with #ifdefs, which the compiler can then fold away in preprocessing or dead code elimination leaving you with the right chunk for the product version. Hex editing the binary won&#x27;t catch this, leaving you with a broken binary.<p>tl;dr: rebuild the software if you screwed up.",1395656172

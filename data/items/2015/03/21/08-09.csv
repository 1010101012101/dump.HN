Two separate companies. \nWeta Workshop deals mostly with physical effects and props etc, rather than visual effects. That&#x27;s not to say the videos are not fake. I don&#x27;t believe the headset is vaporware though, mainly due to the investment from Google. Google got sucked in by D-Wave though, so who&#x27;s to say ...",1426928378

I don&#x27;t believe so. I think bapineuzumab also showed early promise at reducing plaques, though I don&#x27;t remember if they did a cognitive analysis that Biogen did here.<p>Don&#x27;t get me wrong. I think this is the most promising one we&#x27;ve had, if for no other reason than the method used to develop it. They took people who lived into old age without Alzheimer&#x27;s, and found antibodies from them that targeted Abeta (so they claim). Really cool stuff, if true, and very promising.",1426928355

SMTP-time rejection is the only feasible way to handle it.<p>What you&#x27;re seeing (and a conversation I&#x27;ve had numerous times, particularly with some individuals who seem to think it&#x27;s all some Vast Conspiracy Against Personal Communications) is simply the challenges of dealing with email on a scale where you&#x27;ve got more <i>peers</i> than most people have <i>email contacts</i> -- where a peer is another peering email system.<p>It turns into a reputation management system.  And it&#x27;s a lot easier to deal with those reputations when you&#x27;ve got a handful of major public providers (Google, Microsoft, Yahoo, Aol, Inbox, etc.), and a few thousand major corporations.  Once you get outside of the Fortune 500, even corporate emails get hard to deal with.  At Krell Power Systems, we had a customer who required us to provide our email server IPs (already listed in both SPF and DKIM, natch) before they&#x27;d allow mail from us.  The fact that they run a few machines powered by U-235 and are concerned about SCADA threats <i>might</i> have something to do with that level of paranoia.<p>But allowing all spam through, storing it, and relying on users / client software to filter it is expansive and quite error prone.  The <i>good</i> thing about SMTP-time rejection is that it&#x27;s unambiguous: <i>any</i> well-formed server will recognize that it&#x27;s failed delivery, and in most cases the message is immediately bounced back to the sender.  <i>Accepting email and later trying to determine whether or not it&#x27;s legitimate</i> risks spoofing, Joe-Jobs, and silently-lost messages.

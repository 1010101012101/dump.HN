They're called lists in the article and said ""to group values or variables so that the collection may referred to as a unit"", which sounds like a generic list to me.

If the RF module has approval then you don't have an issue. You still need a different kind of approval for your electronic device, but they are just reselling a 3rd party device so no issue there either.<p>I haven't made a mobile phone - instead I have worked on other RF devices.

It's pretty clear that this guy things Digg is a bunch of idiot engineers - I mean, why else allude to ""rudimentary comp. sci. knowledge""?
These articles might have a central point, but when it's surrounded by a bunch of opinion, it like watching TV news (e.g., Fox News).

1217854,comment,1216583,1216583,0,0,ismarc,,,"chipsy covers a good number of concerns, and I unfortunately don't have time to enumerate the full list of issues seen in both, so I'll quickly cover some of the higher level issues:<p>1. (asteroids) Tracking state in a series of global variables and then relying on that state in timer callbacks to implement your gameloop leads to unpredictable gamerate and framerates.<p>2. Embedding the core game logic in mxml file is ""bad form"".  I would suggest creating a game class that is instantiated and called from within that initial mxml file, but it's basically to get the launcher.<p>3. (symptom) You have entirely too many, pointless loops.  You iterate over the same list of objects numerous times in multiple locations.  A good example would be in the most recent Level.as update() function.  You iterate over the GameObjects 3 different times (not counting the inner loop for collision detection) when this can be reduced to 1 loop.<p>4. Variable names...they're poor.  An example is:<p>for each (var object:GameObject in O) {<p>What is O?  Scroll to the top of the function.  O is the result of getObjects().  Well, getObjects obviously gets some objects, but which ones?  What type of collection does it use?  Go to getObjects() definition and it uses a Vector, but you use the name O to build the vector internal to getObjects as well.  The variable name should, at a minimum, provide a hint as to what purpose it serves.  game_objects would be good, or gameObjects, or activeObjects.  And, I can only guess what RBC and WBC even mean.  I'm guessing maybe it's red blood cell and white blood cell?  Even the associated class files don't provide any information, so from the point of view of someone reading the code, RBC and WBC are random letter strings representing a ""something""",1269497418

We haven't fundamentally solved any of the religious or sectarian conflicts however have improved security to stop the most obvious evidence of these conflicts. It's also very unclear what happens in a post-Malki Iraq or how the Iranian influence plays out -- or what happens when extremists rise to power via the democratic process. So ultimately I think we can reach a clean point in the near future to declare victory and leave the country in a better state than we found it but personally I don't see a future where significant US military forces aren't back in Iraq within the next decade. Politically I cannot imagine any situation short of spontaneous middle east peace that would justify this war even if the nation building project ends up being successful. A good parallel would probably be Vietnam. Public opinion has actually gotten worse about the Vietnam war over time even as Vietnam itself reconciled and prospered and the Soviet Union collapsed.",1269497195

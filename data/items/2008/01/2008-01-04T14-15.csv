If people went back to actually liking groups that have more staying power, perhaps that would strengthen the idea of the album again?",1199458540

94791,comment,94765,94765,0,0,paulsb,,,"Albums are great. Singles have always been released as a means to get people to stump up cash for the album, and this should still be the case. There are many albums that have great songs on them, but these songs are probably too unsuitable/unprofitable to be released to the mainstream audience; thus, the release of ""appealing"" singles to get fans and new fans to go and buy the album. Albums also provide variety by exposing listeners to different styles X if everyone just bought the singles, then everyone would only buy the ""club bangers"" that get released or become popular.<p>If the whole system goes to a buy-per-single model, albums, per se, will probably evolve into ""bodies of work"" for that period of an artist's life, which could actually benefit the artist because it will allow them to release material that would not normally make it onto an album, essentially allowing the artist to say ""buy whatever you want"". Buying-per-single will also be a real ball-ache if you have to preview every song to find the ones you want; hence, my support for albums.<p>If the music becomes free, then money will probably come from concerts, merchandise, etc. Heaven forbid that there will be no ad-supported model! Imagine having to listen to adverts between tracks...oh, the inhumanity!<p>Personally, I like albums and will buy them over a couple of singles because it will add up to the same cost and be much more convenient. Ideally, the whole industry should follow the model of a particular website where you buy music by the megabyte, which is obviously linked to the quality that you have it encoded at.",1199457200

It is our light, not our darkness, that most frightens us. We ask ourselves, who am I to be brilliant, gorgeous, talented and fabulous?""<p>I believe that too be so true. And I personally think I am guilty. I am always beating myself down for not being good enough (and reading blogs and following all the superstars of the tech world does not do much to boost your ego) [Of course, I probably am not good enough, but looking down instead of up does affect your morale].<p>On a similar note, I just came across this book [<a href=""http://tinyurl.com/2eyjjc"" rel=""nofollow"">http://tinyurl.com/2eyjjc</a>] that I believe talks along the same lines.<p>bcater: I have occasionally said things like that, after solving a hard algorithm, or just refactoring some messy code, I would turn around to my colleagues and say ""Yeah, I am that good"" [from House, MD the show] and you are right, you can't fake it.

94785,comment,94765,94771,0,0,dood,,,"I'm not sure this means the album will go away altogether, its a nice format if you like the artists' work. The pick-n-mix thing is probably more suited to artists you don't care about so much, but like individual tracks. I think both albums and cherry-picking individual tracks can coexist quite happily.",1199455939

94783,comment,94554,94554,0,0,goodgoblin,,,"When I read the first rant, I didn't really get it - but now it makes a bit more sense.  Sounds like Zed tried to make a career around Mongrel and ended up meeting a bunch of hucksters and shysters.  I was actually thinking of attempting to do a little rails consulting myself - will definately keep this in mind as a cautionary tale.  If the writer of Mongrel has a hard time making a living doing Rails consulting, might not be too much money in it after all.  Also - thinking about the kind of people who would be interested in paying for a Rails project - they probably have read about how coding in RoR is like putting together legos or something and so would expect to pay very little.  In many cases you are likely to get people looking to do something on the cheap.<p>Not saying you would need to do ""Rails consulting"" - any kind of consulting could be successful - i.e. a  normal project where to the client the technology was not as important.  But if you wrote Mongrel and tried to make a living by getting consulting gigs on that reputation, could explain why he ended up dealing with the kinds of people he did.",1199455749

94780,comment,94765,94776,0,0,iamelgringo,,,"Totally agree.  From what I've been able to tell, there are five ways to make money with music:  performance, licensing, merchandising, advertising paying directly for content.<p>Performance--people pay tickets for concerts.<p>Licensing--companies paying artists to play their music during TV/movies/commercials.<p>Merchandising--Artists selling concert t-shirts and posters for $60 a piece is the canonical example.<p>Advertising--Artists building their own ""brand"" and using their brand to shill other products.  Beyonce comes to mind most recently. I've been seeing her all over the place selling everything.<p>Direct pay for content--The business model the RIAA is based on and that is dying.<p>Generally, music is now a digital download, and the artifice of the ""Album as artform"" is finally breaking apart.  Truly some albums were art, but most were filler crap that was packaged around a high budjet single or two.  People are barely willing to pay for a digital single much less entire albums.",1199455435

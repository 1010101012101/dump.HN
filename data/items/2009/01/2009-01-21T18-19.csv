I know that youtube does a poor job, but what other services are better?<p>I decided that I didn't want the hassle of not knowing how a 3rd party video streaming service (e.g. YouTube) might alter the quality. So I use FlowPlayer (an OS flash video player) and hosted the video file (.f4v) and the flash .swf on my webserver. It works fine, so long as you have BW..",1232564294

443615,comment,443374,443475,0,0,mdasen,,,"Probably a combination of things.<p>1. The newspaper industry is just doing really poorly which means there is little money to be had there.  So, this program, not greatly connected to Google's main business, also probably wouldn't make a lot of money.<p>2. Traditional ads (TV/newspaper) differ from web ads.  With the web, you're trying to automatically place ads for an infinite variety of content and users.  With traditional ads, you're placing one ad for every user and there's a finite amount of content.  So, all of Google's techniques for web advertising have little to do with traditional ads.<p>3. What kind of research can you do?  Like, with web ads, people can look at impression to click ratio of the ad placed next to many different content; impression to click of 100 variations of the ad; click to sale based on all those conditions.  Traditional ads you really only get circumstantial evidence (ie. we ran 100 ads this week and sales went up 5%, therefore 100 ads raises sales 5% - which, clearly isn't good evidence since that change could have been caused by any number of things).  Sure, sometimes they say, go to dell.com/tv-offer-8, but how many people do that rather than going to dell.com?<p>Google's success is having computers do the work for them.  They measure things analytically and mine data.  Unfortunately, the traditional market isn't based on data.  Rather, it's based on intuition - this ad makes our product look cool. Sometimes they back the intuition with quasi-data like focus groups, but that's not a Google thing.  Google mines hard quantitative data, they don't intuit, they don't do qualitative data.  I'm not saying that the others are worse, just that it isn't Google's realm and therefore it just doesn't fit Google in the way that web ads do.<p>Google is great at a few very important things.  They don't have great ideas on how to revolutionize everything.  If there isn't a lot of data to analyze or something that needs a ton of computing power, Google's unlikely to have a great solution to your problem.",1232564113

Because entrepreneurship is an addiction, it isn't a choice. Great entrepreneurs aren't driven to create companies because it is easy, or because capital is plentiful, or because the public markets are swallowing anything the venture community will throw at them. Great entrepreneurs start companies because they can't help themselves.</i><p>If the entrepreneurs can't get funding or customers, they won't be able to start companies, so they'll go off and do other things. More than drive is needed; they also need to eat and make rent.<p>It is possible to squash the entrepreneurial spirit of a people, as observed in post-Soviet Eastern Europe.<p><i>While the resources an entrepreneur may be able to bring to bear on a problem may vary with the economic climate, the desire -- the need -- to innovate never goes away.

It doesnt have many bells or whistles, but I don't need it to. I get it to output a very high bitrate avi file. The real issue for me is how to then encode and stream the video. Here's what I tried, and where I'm at now:<p>1. Use the SWFProducer app that comes with CamStudio. It produces an SWF that is nice and small, but it doent not allow progressive streaming, which is a big no-no for me..<p>2. Use FFMpeg to convert the avi to an .flv file, and then use FlowPlayer to allow users to watch the video online. Works, but .flv isnt great quality for the file size.<p>3. Use FFMpeg to convert the avi to an H.264 .mp4 file. Then either use FlowPlayer to allow users to watch the video online, or post as an .mp4 and allow users watch it using QuickTime plug-in. It Works, but it doesn't allow progressive streaming, which is a big no-no again...<p>4. (What I'm using today). Use FFMPEG to convert the avi to an H.264 encoded .f4v file (the new flash video standard). Use FlowPlayer to allow the user to watch it online. Allows progressive streaming and is decent quality.<p>5. (What I want to get to one day..) Encode using a codec designed specifically for screen-casting. I tried the 'Flash Screen Video' codec in FFMPEG and it produced a very nice quality file, but the size was ~2.5x the .f4v file, so I decided not to go with it. I'm hoping there is a better codec out there somewhere...<p>Using (4) my video is:
650x620 pixels
24 fps
~700 kbps
(includes a 320x240 video - so a screen casting codec may not do the trick anyway - maybe I need a hybrid?)<p>Looking forward to learning about what others are doing.",1232562490

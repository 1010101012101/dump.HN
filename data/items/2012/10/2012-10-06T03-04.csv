The auto industry is highly concentrated in a single geographic area and are all economically dependent upon one another due to shared suppliers. It's very likely that if GM or Chrysler went bankrupt Ford would too. Who would be left then to use these assets? Some unnamed US automotive company? A Japanese automotive company? (imagine how that would go over.) Just how long do you think it would have taken for Detroit to get back to work? A month? 6 months? A year? A decade? Don't forget that if Detroit went bankrupt and turned into a dust bowl, aside from the untold amounts of human suffering it would drag down GDP and have wide-ranging effects on the rest of the country.",1349495691

Tap phone on sensor<p>The end.<p>The NFC system in Japan (standard on nearly all phones except iPhone) works by putting virtual cash into some chip that doesn't need the phone. In fact you can do it with your train pass which was the first way they did it and then later added the same chip to the phone's case.<p>So, no need to turn on the phone or choose an app. To add cash to the chip there is an app so basically you add $50-$200 and then don't worry about it for a week or month.<p>Since they started as train passes you can also rid all the trains, subways and buses (take a out phone, tap on sensor, done).<p>You can even reserve seats for long distance trains on your phone, walk on the train, there's a sensor above the seat you tap to ""check in"". Tap it again to check out if you want to switch seats.<p>The chip holds all the transactions on it. My 2006 Sony Vaio has a reader built in for the chip which can import that transactions for things like expense reports.

1, will an email marketing export be helpful? will they insist to send legit receivers? will it be an excuse to have horrible result, charge us tons of $$ then leave us struggle?
2, where to find them? any place that we can simply hire and pay without worrying too much about the skill level, profession ethic, etc.?

Basically, for a small fee of around $2 a month, you could go to a box, select your novel, then go ahead and read it for as long as you want. I know ebooks are where it's at these days, but I just keep running into people who love and miss the feel of real books, yet find it inconvenient to go to a bookstore or library to get one book. That is why I think placing a kiosk at places people go to all the time, such as super markets, gas stations, street corners, etc, will allow people to come across these machines without having to go out of their way. They will be going to places they normally go to various times a week.
Therefore, I just wanted some feedback on the idea. Would you use it or not? The pricing point would have to be very low, which I think $2 a month is. I feel if it works for DVDs, then it can work for novels, please let let me know what you think! Thanks!",1349492732

If in the age of internets we can't stand people with differing opinions and all have to be beaten into same mold, then we are really screwed.",1349492683

My friends aren't on Twitter or G+, I've never intentionally gone on 4chan, and I just go on youtube for the free music and funny clips. Facebook is where it's at, so I also disagree with the author.",1349492604

Telling him to ""be nice"" then dropping his e-mail and face as some kind of stick-waving, threatening gesture?<p>Congratulations on demonstrating to me and countless others why I shouldn't use any product that you EVER touch. You don't get a pass because you're just two nerds. You have a form with a submit button -- <i>that's where your responsibility as a founder and custodianship of user data begins</i>. Day 1, you're already a liability.<p>I realize this is a pretty direct attack but I'm appalled and staggered by your behavior in this thread. You launched a service on the <i>public Internet</i>. There is no grace period, there is no ""friendly fire""; you fucked up and you disclosed <i>AWS credentials</i>. Not users' favorite colors. <i>AWS KEYS</i>. Tied to <i>credit cards</i>, running servers, S3 backups, God knows what. You don't get to tell people to be nice to you when you're acting as the steward of <i>AWS credentials</i>; you protect them and act like you care when someone tells you that you fucked up doing so.<p>Your behavior here is just foreboding for the future, and you need to realize that before launching your next endeavor (this one is probably done, after that little mess).",1349492559

It was also a demonstration that the people running the business have <i>absolutely no idea</i> what they are doing when it comes to security, privacy, or testing and release processes. (Actually, there is an alternative explanation, which is even worse: they knew and didn't care. I prefer to assume naivety rather than malice.)<p>Unfortunately, the only sensible action when faced with a business like this is to run away and not look back for a very long time, except perhaps to check who the people responsible were so you can avoid anything else they work on in the near future as well.",1349492534

Before that I had a job where I specified the technology that I was using -- and that everyone else had to use. Before that I picked a job that used technology I wanted to be using. And so on...I haven't been ""forced"" to use a technology that I didn't think appropriate for a long time (unless you count the idiot decisions by Google and Apple to use Java and Objective C, respectively, but I've been minimizing my contamination by both).<p>And it was exactly passion and an urge to learn, just as the guy described in the article, that enabled me to be in this position. My contract work pays up to $125/hour, and I'm rapidly approaching age 50, so what were you saying about ""medium wage""? Or do you work for Wall Street and make twice that now?<p>Or maybe you've got the wrong job? Or you don't have a passion for programming?

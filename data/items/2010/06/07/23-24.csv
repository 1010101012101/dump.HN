Do you remember what the feature was?<p>Now to address your broader point, we are at a stage in Zoho (over 1200 people in the company Zoho Corp, check zohocorp.com, with Zoho.com division alone having around 400 people) where venture capital would not make a difference to the way we operate (except that we would necessarily have to worry about an exit for the VCs). So I can say with confidence it was not lack of financial resources that led to us not adding the feature. It is most likely due to competing priorities in our product teams, and the fact that you simply cannot keep adding people (however qualified), bloat a team, and still expect results.",1275955075

1412492,comment,1412040,1412040,0,0,techiferous,,,"Most humans think about the world in a framework of justice.  I believe this innovation started with Zoroastrianism and then spread to post-exilic Judaism which, of course, led to Christianity and Islam.  One of the defining characteristics of Zoroastrianism was its emphasis not just on accountability, but on <i>individual</i> accountability.  More info: <a href=""http://www.newworldencyclopedia.org/entry/Zoroastrianism"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.newworldencyclopedia.org/entry/Zoroastrianism</a><p>Vedic religions have different historical roots (although both Vedic religions and Zoroastrianism share a common Aryan heritage).  Vedic religions, therefore, have less of a sense of justice and I wonder if there is less of the Just-World Fallacy there.  If you think that the concept of karma is the Vedic religions' take on justice, then you may be misunderstanding karma.  Vedic religions don't have a strong concept of the individual self, so ""you reap what you sow"" doesn't quite capture the concept because there is no definite ""you"".",1275955021

The more you cram in there the more degraded older and less intense memories get until you can't recall more than a vague feeling, and eventually nothing at all.

Instead of trying to match a value against a list of patterns, it tries to match two (or more) potentially partially-defined values against each other.<p>Pattern matching is one of my favorite language features. PM-based code is usually quite straightforward to read (especially compared to a jumble of nested 'if's!), and can be compiled to efficient decision trees. It also works well with both static typing (checking full coverage of ML-style variant types) and dynamic typing (such as with Erlang's receive).

I actually believe that Jobs believes what he writes. I just think what he writes is wrong.<p>Regarding a stable mobile flash implementation. You are right they haven't.<p>But the same can be said about HTML5 convincingly showing that it can compete with flash on other than some video, without sucking up CPU.<p>Showing a slideshow or some simple transition simply isn't going to cut if if you want to talk about comparative experiences.<p>The whole multitouch argument is also misleading as there really isn't any reason why Flash wouldn't be able to work with that. The flash player would be written specifically for the iPad/iPhone anyway so that could be solved. And rollover isn't by any metrics a problem. That too can be easily solved.<p>If Apple really where serious about open standards why not disallow flash on the laptops? They have far less battery life than their mobile peers so the reason to remove it from there would be just as strong.<p>I don't really care whether you like the things that flash is being used for and there is absolutely no reason to believe that HTML5 wont be the exact same things happening. Whether annoying banner ads or clunky recreations of gui elements.<p>If HTML5 is better it will end up replacing Flash. But HTML5 has a very long journey before it's anywhere close to flash. At least if it was possible to opt in or out of flash in the setting people would have a choice and we would see a natural selection process taking place.<p>Instead what we have is a bunch of bad excuses for why Flash shouldn't be on the iPad and iPhone.<p>The only thing apple get out of that is going to be substandard flash emulation with JavaScript and Canvas.

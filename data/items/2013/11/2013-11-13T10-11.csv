6724414,comment,6724292,6724292,27,0,ivanr,,,"Great decision! When Google started to work on SPDY and made it SSL-only, we saw what the future could be: people upgrade to the new protocol for performance, but get better security too. What&#x27;s not to like! I was really afraid that the standardisation of HTTP/2.0 will break this, but now all seems well after all.<p>But this is not enough; we also need to work on opportunistic encryption, to be used for sites that do not use SSL today, without any certificates, in a completely transparent fashion that requires no end-user configuration. Such encryption would not be enough to defeat active main in the middle attacks, but it would defeat passive monitoring of non-encrypted communication.<p>To those complaining about the hassle of SSL: The biggest problem today is the fact that virtual SSL hosting (multiple sites sharing an IP address without sharing the certificate, otherwise known as Server Name Indication, or SNI) is not feasible. As soon as Windows XP (the only major platform that does not support SNI) goes away, SSL will become much easier; especially for hosted services.<p>That the cost (of certificates) is a problem is a myth. It might have been a problem in the past, but today there are so many CAs to choose from. There are CAs that give away free domain-validated certificates. There are CAs that give away free certificates to open source projects. And there are also companies that sell certificates for a couple of dollars only.<p>Obtaining certificates is, no doubt, a hassle, but the fact remains that CA-issued certificates is the only practical option to deploy a secure web site today. There are also some issues with latency, but perhaps with HTTP/2.0 (and some possible improvements in TLS 1.3) those are going to be minimised, too.",1384340156

This is EXTREMELY fast, and with modern computing power and memory/storage capacities these libraries can be huge and won&#x27;t just include things like common passwords and dictionary words but also random strings of characters up to fairly long lengths. With this sort of attack you just filter the list of hashes through your table and you end up with a list of passwords.<p>The important thing about un-salted hashes is that no matter how much work is put into building the table it&#x27;s amortized over the total number of passwords attacked, over all time. Which drastically lowers the amount of effort per password.<p>With a per-entry salt this sort of attack is no longer possible. Instead you are forced to do a brute force attack on each and every password. If, hypothetically, it took a week to generate a really good rainbow table then it would take essentially just one week to crack nearly 860,000 passwords. Whereas with unique salts it would take 860,000 weeks.<p>However, that&#x27;s only in the hypothetical case. In practice many people have weak passwords, and a well-built system can compute a huge number of md5 hashes per second. Someone built a multi-GPU monster system that could compute 180 <i>billion</i> md5 hashes per second while only taking up about half of a standard server rack of space (5x 4U). So if you toss an extremely large dictionary of password guesses with even millions or tens of millions of entries it will still take only a fraction of a second to check each hash, so you can crack a significant number of passwords (at leas the ones that aren&#x27;t incredibly strong) in only a matter of days.",1384338947

In terms of constraints, there is no dynamic loading i.e. you have to build a single binary. But at the same time it was pretty fascinating with os, networking stack, drivers all contained in a separate folder building up one project. Lately they have added power management, Android like UI and even some hyper-visor support. Most importantly, it is small and consistent enough for a programmer willing to learn through the entire stack. Helps with much better visualization from hardware to application. A couple of former colleagues (one of which incidentally now works with QNX and hence compared both) highlights both i.e. strengths vs weaknesses of each.

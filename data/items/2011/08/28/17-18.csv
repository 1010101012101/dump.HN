Telephones certainly weren't anonymous, or undetectable.  In fact when they first started they weren't even private but quasi public (to the operator and others on the party line).<p>I'm not arguing with the ideal, just pointing out that we didn't transition straight from face to face, anonymous and undetectable to the internet.  We passed through the telephone phase, which last many decades, and arguably had less tools available to do what you wanted.  Internet communication is an outgrowth of the telephone and its network, but arguably with some work is able to provide more of what you want.<p>Your home phone was the equivalent of a gmail address.  A pay phone was closer to a home email server, or an anonymous internet cafe web browsing session.  If its shocking that this debate isn't larger about web decentralization, it should be doubly shocking that it never seemed to occur at all, so far as I can tell, during the phone age.<p>But regardless, your ISP will always be present, and your packets will always traverse many dozens of pieces of networking equipment, owned by several dozen big faceless institutions, along the way.

I've personally used python, matlab, R and Stata in my research and view the first three as about equally capable.  In my opinion Stata is less comparable to the others as it is more a  wysiwyg collection of tools and functions.  Matlab has good support for large data sets via memory mapping, has  mex extensibility for building your own fast functions and is very good for interactive plotting, but doesn't produce publication-quality finals.  Python is great for no-niggling fast idea to functioning execution and can push data into matlab is mlabraw.  R has well developed stats packages and a huge user base.

2934451,comment,2933619,2933802,5,0,dredmorbius,,,"Spam filtering is a wicked problem. The solutions are contextual, and there's no one single tool that will slay the dragon.<p>That said, a great many anti-spam solutions work by well-known and publicly available methods.  DKIM (header signing) actually utilizes PKI.  DNSBLs are publicly queryable (in some cases the zonefiles may be downloaded), Bayesian and rules-based filters are also generally available.<p>The real challenges are:<p>1. Spam is cheap. Spam mail outnumbers ham (non-spam mail) by 100:1 or better. There's a lot of it.<p>2. Distinguishing spam from ham is contextual, and people's contexts differ.<p>3. False positives are expensive. Wrongly classifying ham as spam carries far worse consequences than wrongly classifying spam as ham (false negatives). Filters must skew to permissive.<p>4. There's little central agreement on methods, there are many old systems in existence.  We've seen a few small advances (DKIM, SPF) in the past decade, but brute-force content filtering is still required.<p>5. Even well-established strong verification tools are too technically advanced for the vast majority of the userbase, and/or are unappealing to others.  PGP MIME-encoded email signatures (strong cryptographic identity verification) dates to 1991, fer crissakes!  Getting even corporate-supported users to employ this properly is at best difficult (though it's becoming ever so slightly more common largely due to compliance requirements). For others, repudiability is important.<p>6. It's an arms race.  Spammers change methods (many based on automated tools assuring rapid widespread adoption of new methods) based on new anti-spam methods.<p>7. Client and server (MUA/MTA) support for tools which would facilitate whitelisting of users and mail peers is difficult. Centralizing mail gateways can complicate the issue if those core gateways emit proportionately high levels of spam (I see or have seen middlin' amounts of spam from Hotmail, Yahoo, GMail, AOL, and other large email service providers, though generally they're pretty good).<p>That said:  whitelisting, reputation systems (sender, server, DKIM, SPF), authentication (DKIM, PGP), contextual (Bayesian), and rules-based (e.g.: SpamAssassin) properly used do make the situation tenable. But this requires extensive support largely for the administrator of an email gateway. End-users may be forgiven for thinking spam is a ""solved problem"", though at their level it largely is.<p>What ultimately will solve the email spam problem will be for email to be superseded by another communications channel (SMS, weblogs, social sites, etc.) to the extent that spammers focus their energies there. It's an economic problem, and if the economics fail to support spamming, the (smart) spammers will move elsewhere.",1314553355

Everyday, I learn about a new app, that allows me to solve a need that I have on my phone itself. For example, unless I need to send out a long e-mail, I don't bother signing into G-mail on my computer anymore. I have stopped checking to see if I have new mail multiple times  day. My phone buzzes and lets me know quite reliably. I don't log onto ""Reddit"" any more. When I have a few free minutes and want something to laugh about, I use the Reddit app on my phone. When I want to see how my sites are doing, I use the Google Analytics app. Basically, as I learn about more apps, I seem to be getting more and more of my problems solved on my phone itself. I am less inclined to turn on my computer unless I have to do actual work. But, since I work in technology, there is still a compelling need in my life that my computer solves.<p>On the other hand, lets talk about my Aunt. She has little or no association with technology. The only reason she uses her computer is to exchange email and chat with her kids on Skype. If her computer decided to disappear today, and she asked me what to buy....I would tell her to buy a nice Android phone. It can do everything she wants to achieve. A computer is an over-kill for her needs. The Android phone will be pretty, cheap, not take up space and have a much more manageable learning curve.<p>My point is simple, Google has made Android smart-phones something a lot of people can have. The Android apps ecosystem grows everyday. And each app, targets a particular need (in-theory). So, if in-theory, if I gave 100% of the people I know Android smartphones and taught them how to find and install apps, about 50% of the people I know would never feel the need to switch on their computers again. All the problems they solved with their computer, would be solved by these tiny apps that take a second to load and are quite pretty to look at.<p>The only people who would end up switching on their computer are the people who would have to do serious ""work"" or enjoy serious ""entertainment"".<p>THE POINT: By creating this app ecosystem and trying to get Android in everybody's hands has Google not solved people's problems too efficiently. So efficiently, that they don't need Google anymore other than to do ""hard core research"". Google makes the bulk of its money on transactional queries, and if people simply stop doing those because there is a beautiful m-commerce app instead. And using Google is a 4 step process while using the app is a 2 step process, then Google will loose out badly.<p>People will still go to Google for doing hard-core research, but those are informational queries. Potential advertisers don't like those queries because they don't have commercial intent. Not a good place to push products. People will click but wont be ready to buy.<p>Lastly, yes there is a search bar on all android devices. But I find my self using that only when I can find a sexy app to solve my problem more efficiently.<p>What do you guys think? Has Google eliminated the need for it's own existence?",1314552881

A better phrase would be ""no answers are found inside the building"".  You can't just ask people what they need and build it, that's not customer development.  Customer development is about finding a problem worth solving and that people are willing to pay for.  You need to understand the problem thoroughly, and that requires you to get out of the building and talk to lots of people.  If the solution was obvious, and the people you talked to told you what to build, then you wouldn't have much of a business, because the problem would be easy to solve (and someone would have solved it, or they'd do it in house).<p>Customers don't hold all the answers, but they can point you to the right solution.  You still need to come up with an optimal solution.  Once you reach product-market fit, then you can work on optimizing customer acquisition.  Before product-market fit, you don't know what your product really is or who your customers really are.  Any time spent optimizing that is time that could be better spent finding the actual problem and getting to product-market fit.  At best you risk wasting time, at worst you risk following the wrong path because you've invested so much time optimizing it, which would make pivoting to the ""right"" product/market much more difficult.",1314552030

2934373,comment,2934103,2934103,0,0,nirvana,,,"I've been starting businesses since I was a kid. It is like a hobby, or maybe an obsession.  I once started a business without realizing I had done so![1] Once I found the pleasure in selling, I just kept doing it.  Once I started having a positive income (e.g.: bringing in more money than I needed to live well) I started investing. I've been investing for a couple decades, it also is a hobby.  For the past four years I've been a full time nomad-- working on a startup and traveling full time, living out of a backpack.  I have built  a half dozen successful businesses, and worked for two dozen startups. I've spent a fair bit of time learning about these subjects and would be happy to share my experiences.  I too would like to find a site like this.<p>The thing is, when you've become successful to some degree, inevitably, your perspective changes.  The perspective of those who've achieved some success is very different from those who want to achieve success but haven't, yet.<p>I don't mean this in an elitist way-- there's nothing I'd like more than to share what I've learned with people who are in the position I was when I was starting out.<p>Unfortunately, Hacker News is not that place.  When I've broached such subjects, the responses have not been of the ""I'm interested in learning your perspective"" variety, more of the ""I'm going to tell you that you're wrong because authority X told me so.""<p>I'm trying to come up with some examples that won't obviously and immediately offend people.  But, for instance, talking about how you can invest yourself (one of the OP's topics) often is met with ""you'd be better off buying index funds"" responses.   It doesn't matter that I've been investing myself and getting outsized returns, and found that it really isn't that hard, and I'd love to share the techniques-- the dominant perspective is that individuals cannot beat the market.   Or, if you talk about tax mitigation, the response is often along the lines of ""you shouldn't do that, you owe it to society"".  Or if you attempt to explaining what's going on in economic terms but your perspective disagrees with the popular mainstream one (which is keynesianism, or more accurately, krugmanism) you're met with often derisive responses.   You know, if economics is a science, it should be able to predict things...and good economists predicted the housing bubble. Even Ron Paul was caught on video in 2001 predicting it.<p>Anyway, one of the big lessons of business that I've learned, is that economics is important. Perspective is important.  Learning about business, and becoming successful really is about changing your perspective.<p>Unfortunately, due to the organization of this site (stories disappear quickly, detailed discussions are a bit difficult) and the culture, it is hard to share a perspective that disagrees with the majority one.<p>I once was told my company was not a real startup, but that it was a ""lifestyle business"".... this from someone that, near as I could tell, had never started a business.  Hell, even if it is a lifestyle business... it gave me a fantastic lifestyle!   I don't feel that people here on HN want to learn from those who have had success... and as much success as I <i>have</i> had, I really want to learn from those who have had <i>MORE</i>.<p>HN is the closest I've found, for all the seemingly negative things I'm saying about it.... I wish there were a way to change it so that we could share these things.<p>But if HN is too big of a ship, then I'd be keen to hang out in a private forum.  Really, get just a dozen good people there- people who have started businesses and are not ashamed of being capitalists-- and you can have some great discussion.<p>[1] I was importing tools from china, and because I didn't know their quality, and the price was so low, I tended to buy 2 or 4 of everything figuring they might break.  The quality was actually good, so I'd sell the extras, but then without realizing it I started buying more and more every order.  I found that keeping four drills around was convenient, as I'd just keep different bits in each one and witch tools, but the next time I ordered, I ordered 4 more drills and then sold them, then ordered 8 extra drills and sold them as well.  Same thing with bit sets, and other tools. I was making great markups on the tools, but when I realized what I was doing I stopped because it wasn't really scalable.",1314551965

2934336,comment,2934003,2934277,2,0,wildanimal,,,"I entirely agree though my personal preference is for lattice over ggplot as it is faster and more flexible at the present time (the ""limitations"" of ggplot reflect the preference of the creator; e.g. not being able to have two axes for the same plot). But reshape and also plyr are quite useful.<p>R does have surprising capability for shell scripting and text processing, albeit slower than Python. I also use Python for the rapid text-processing necessary (possibly populating an SQL database) for R to eventually use.<p>I've been keeping an eye on SciPy, but there still seems to be a lot of ""the source code is the documentation"", whereas in R the documentation is usually superb and well-structured. And Matplotlib, while beautiful, seems to be more verbose than Matlab or R when it comes to customizing details of the graphics (e.g., axes, etc.). That's just my impression, but I wouldn't mind being shown otherwise.",1314551243

2934328,comment,2933994,2934272,2,0,DanielBMarkham,,,"Perhaps this is related to having some sense of value just in the amount of money involved?<p>Many folks won't think twice of spending a hundred hours or more each year managing a property they rarely use because of the value of the property. Whereas if they spent that same amount of time worrying over something inexpensive? It would either be considered a hobby -- done exclusively for the experience -- or a sign of some sort of OCD.<p>I have been very fortunate in my life to have gone many times between having lots of extra cash and having to scrimp and save. I found it took several such cycles for me to finally ""get it"" For a long time, when I was flush I would buy things. A top-of-the line computer each year. A vehicle that I paid to have refurbished to my specifications. A large piece of land for an office. And so on. One day I woke up, looked around, and thought <i>just what is the purpose of all of this?</i> Owning things gave me a sense of security, and perhaps a sense of social collateral, but the trade-off just wasn't worth it. If you want security, it's better just to have cash in the bank. If you want to socially signal with your possessions, I'd advise making enough to first pay somebody else to manage all of it before you load up. Or better yet, just do long-term leasing and have maintenance and such be completely hands-off from your end. Assuming you have the money, the buying is the easy part.",1314551051

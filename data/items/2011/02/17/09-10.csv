It gives poor usability (impossible to select text, or to change the font size for some part of the text).  We would definitely be very interested in a tool that could take our documents in pdf and give us back the html5 code so that we can edit it manually (embedded videos instead of images, adding some interactive feature) before packaging it as an iPad app.<p>There is definitively a market for tools allowing to do things like that.

The books you see with considerable discount are often those taken back by the publisher and then sent back out as 80-90% off.  Softcovers aren't even returned--- the bookseller just rips off the covers and sends those back to minimize shipping costs.  In high school, I worked in a B.

Parallel algorithms are about determining which steps in an algorithm can be executed independently of one another to take full advantage of multiple CPUs.

This is so inaccurate on so many levels. Mainly because everything scales. Obviously for some situations languages like C will deal tons better - like google search. And some languages will be able to support more connections per server (again, C and even Ruby without the rails framework on top). But at the end of the day - Ruby on Rails will scale like any other language/framework, just sort out the database side to shard/slave and your away.<p>Oh and it compared Ruby on Rails to the Google App Engine. Two totally different things.<p>Just doesn't seem like a well thought out article to me?",1214862034

232472,comment,231558,231823,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"You're not alone.  I was talking with someone from Google who works on the Gmail support team, and has an interest in user-to-user support, in general, the other day, and she was asking me about how hard it would be to convert the newly Open Source reddit into a ticket tracker.<p>I think it underestimates the importance of other aspects of a tracker--but my lack of confidence in the idea may be based on my own prejudices based on years of working with traditional issue trackers.  I expect to receive an email when a new ticket is filed, so we'd need to add notifications.  I'm missing emailed ticket submission (I miss it in my current tracker, and will be moving to something else because of this lack), so you'd need to add email ticket submission.  Assignments are a core part of any ticket tracker--you need to be able to take ownership of an issue so that others don't spend time on it unnecessarily (though others should be able to follow it).<p>But, I do think several things would shake out of the model that are hard to do now:<p>Priority.  The less someone knows the more important they believe their issue is.  So, it's basically a no-op field in most trackers I've ever used.  The developers might use them to good effect, and a few advanced users.  But since greater than 50% of priorities are set incorrectly, it's a useless field for sorting (and my current tracker doesn't let me remove it from the form, as it is the primary sort key!).  Since everyone gets a vote, priority as ""hotness"" would be a great improvement.  But, it assumes your whole community is looking at the tracker, which is extremely unlikely.<p>Discussions.  People rarely talk on issue trackers because the conversation tools are weak--the focus is never on making it work really well for discussions.  reddit/HN have great threaded conversations, and you can vote on what's relevant and accurate.  I would very much like better discussions in my tickets.<p>But, I think it would require something like a total conversion to this sort of forum as the entirety of your forums/mailing list/bugs system.  Which might be a good idea for someone starting from scratch.  If you have sub-reddit style categories, with one for tickets, that'd be a pretty effective system, I think.  Though you can't currently ""close"" a thread on HN or reddit, and call it ""fixed""...so that'd be something to add.<p>Anyway, I'd love to see how an implementation like this worked out in a reasonably large community.  It might be something we'd want to try on our Open Source community site (our commercial site is already too set in its ways and customers hate change).  But the Open Source site needs a bit of a refresh...it currently uses SourceForge for its tickets, which kinda sucks.",1214861625

If you're at multiple packs a day, you definitely want to taper off, either by smoking less or consuming your nicotine in a healthier way (like gum or a patch). If you must smoke after you quit, smoke something other than nicotine. I would recommend blue lotus as a mild smokeable herb that isn't a poison.<p>Beyond that, there are psychiatric medications that help. The one one expressly to help quit smoking has some very odd side effects (vivid dreams and suicidal ideations). I suspect that plain old anti-depressants would also help.

There are all sorts of imagined withdrawal symptoms. The first thing to realize is that smoking isn't merely a bad habit, it is a legitimate drug addiction. Smokers are addicted to nicotine. Now, even though nicotine addiction is real, the withdrawal symptoms are ridiculously mild when compared to other drugs. When a heroin addict quits, they get the shakes, fevers, cold sweats, diarrhea, barf all over the place, can't eat anything, and even get physical goose bumps. When a smoker quits, the only thing that happens is that you want another cigarette. Nicotine actually leaves your body completely in 3 days, so the actual physical withdrawal symptoms (which are just craving cigarettes) only last a long weekend. After that, you have to deal with the behavioral issues, which is easier to do if you have some sort of cognitive framework to deal with them, which is what the book I mentioned provides.",1214860536

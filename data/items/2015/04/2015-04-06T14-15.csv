What people do care about is if others know or could know about their embarrassing moments or their flaws.<p>Additionally they aren&#x27;t literally trying to say they will use  your dirty pictures to blackmail you, this is just an extreme example of what they used by John Oliver to make the issue more accessible.

9328301,comment,9328123,9328123,0,0,footpath,,,"There was a similar story with Jason Trigg, an MIT graduate who went to work for a hedge fund just so he could give money away, also influenced by Peter Singer. See these discussions:<p><a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5800345"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5800345</a><p><a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5819762"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5819762</a><p>Here&#x27;s the top comment from the second link:<p><i>Quote from quanticle:<p><pre><code>        If you choose a profession that doesn&#x27;t arouse your everyday passion for
	the sake of serving instead some abstract faraway good, you might end up as a
	person who values the far over the near. You might become one of those people
	who loves humanity in general but not the particular humans immediately
	around. You might end up enlarging the faculties we use to perceive the far
	-- rationality -- and eclipsing the faculties we use to interact with
	those closest around -- affection, the capacity for vulnerability and
	dependence. Instead of seeing yourself as one person deeply embedded in a
	particular community, you may end up coolly looking across humanity as a
	detached god.
</code></pre>
Brooks sees this as a disdvantage, but I do not. Frankly, given the levels of irrational thought and behavior we see in the world today, we should be doing everything we can to increase the amount of rationality and far-oriented thinking in the world. I would posit that a world in which people were more like Jason Trigg would be a far better world, on every measurable metric, than the present that David Brooks endeavors to defend. I mean, Trigg, at least, has a goal and a plan to achieve it. The goal is the old utilitarian one of achieving the greatest good for the greatest number. The means is to earn lots of money and spend it on that goal.<p><pre><code>        Third, and most important, I would worry about turning yourself into a means
	rather than an end. If you go to Wall Street mostly to make money for charity,
	you may turn yourself into a machine for the redistribution of wealth. You may
	turn yourself into a fiscal policy.
</code></pre>
And what&#x27;s wrong with that? The problem with fiscal policy is not the goal of fiscal policy. It is the coercive means used to achieve it. There is no coercion here. No one is forcing Jason Trigg to give away his wealth. He is doing it of his own volition. Were he older and richer, he&#x27;d be lauded as another Carnegie, or another Gates.<p><pre><code>        Making yourself is different than producing a product or an external outcome,
	requiring different logic and different means. I&#x27;d think you would be more
	likely to cultivate a deep soul if you put yourself in the middle of the
	things that engaged you most seriously. If your profoundest interest is dying
	children in Africa or Bangladesh, it&#x27;s probably best to go to Africa or
	Bangladesh, not to Wall Street.
</code></pre>
That&#x27;s not true at all. Sure, if you have skills that are needed in Africa or Bangladesh, it&#x27;s best to go there. But not everyone has such skills. If we all pitched in like Jason Trigg and managed to get a cheap malaria vaccine crafted, say, 3 years from now, we&#x27;ll have done far more good than if we&#x27;d all gone to Bangladesh or Africa volunteering to hand out bed nets. It comes down to the old question: are you worried about doing good or feeling good? If you&#x27;re worried about doing good, you coldly analyze all the alternatives, and pick the one with the highest impact, even if it has zero visibility whatsoever. If you&#x27;re worried about feeling good, you do what David Brooks advocates. You go down to Africa, Asia, or where-ever and get warm fuzzies by hoisting the white man&#x27;s burden.<p>Rationality is not a sin. Calculation is not a sin. Money is not inherently sinful. All of these things are means, and have the capability to do both great good or great harm, depending on the end to which they&#x27;re applied. Jason Trigg understands this. David Brooks does not. And that&#x27;s why I, personally, respect Jason Trigg a lot more than David Brooks.</i>",1428331556

Orchestration is pretty much built-in, including rolling deployment/restarts. Performance can be lacking on large cluster due to the many network round trips and lack of agent. Agents can be faked by rsync&#x27;ing config and running ansible in local mode. You can use ansible to do it and ansible is a great Fabric replacement.<p>Salt is much heavier to setup. Has explicit agents (&quot;minions&quot;) and a server (&quot;Salt master&quot;) whereas ansible can be run from anywhere as long as SSH connection exists. Salt maintains metadata (&quot;grains&quot;) about the remote hosts, ansible gathers whatever data it needs on demand. Salt is heavy on the custom terminology and concepts. You have to work with the metaphors. Salt states are much more declarative.<p>Both make use of YAML for a lot of things.<p>My impression was that Ansible is a far better tool for smaller environments with, say, less then 20-50 hosts being managed and the learning curve is surprisingly shallow. When I got it to work, I had more difficulty getting Vagrant to like Ansible than Ansible to setup a complicated stack (Islandora for the curious.) The semi declarative nature of the Ansible modules was easy to work with but getting idempotence was actually a bit of a pain.<p>I&#x27;ve not fully setup Salt because of the level of effort required.

It provides a <i>direct</i> incentive in the form of $/hectare-year.  If your use of the land does not earn at least that amount, you lose money by owning it.  If it does, the relative burden of the tax decreases as you make your use of the land more efficient.<p>A dense urban business district is incontestably a more efficient use of land than an agricultural field.  If any land is removed from cultivation because the crop yields cannot support the tax, then the land with the lowest yields, and therefore least suited for agriculture, will be abandoned first.  Those lands might be better suited for other purposes.  In that sense, the tax is working exactly as expected.<p>And that farm-use consideration is vital for keeping the tax low.  The government cannot use that tax to squeeze any particular type of person without devastating agriculture.  If you try to use a tax as a sledgehammer rather than a speed bump, you end up with all sorts of nasty unintended consequences.<p>If you need a sledgehammer, you can simply write a zoning law that effectively abolishes new low-density residential neighborhoods.

As you have picked up, they really can&#x27;t be both. Hacking is experimental, and it&#x27;s fun, and it definitely is not optimized around impressing a VC or a journalist in 3 minutes or less. If you wanted to be a true hackathon, you would ban the investors and journalists and really ban judging altogether and just have everyone show everyone else their projects. Even the idea of &quot;fun&quot; is different between the two crowds, with the hacker crowd expecting the &quot;fun&quot; part to be the cool hacks themselves, and the journalist/finance crowd expecting the fun part to be the boozing up and making plans for how you spend your millions after you focused on optimizing a commercial product (ususally with more emphasis on marketability and monetization potential than cool tech). If you want to &quot;win&quot; a hackathon i.e. impress a VC/Angel/CEO/Journalist, of course you should prepare beforehand, it&#x27;s extremely difficult to verify cheating and very little real technology can be built in that timespan and that environment (party wooo!). You should also focus way more on the design and pitch then on the functionality, since the judges only have the time to evaluate the design/pitch. The good news is you can also treat the pitchatons like a hackathon and just ignore the judging/prizes, they can still be nice networking events regardless and times to learn some new things/APIs. Or you can try to game the prizes, but either way I wouldn&#x27;t take them too seriously. How many hackathon projects turn into anything real anyway?<p>The current Hackathon culture is indicative of a general tech and investing culture of picking &quot;hot&quot; ideas made by charismatic teams over people doing true technological innovation which takes sustained, serious effort.

    var request = require(&#x27;request&#x27;);

      request.get(url, function (err, body) {

Here, if one wanted to test the actual business logic (without implicitly testing the request module as well), one would have to refactor the code such that the callback is somehow exposed to the test suite. Additionally, one would not be able to run such tests in isolation (i.e. without an internet connection), and the test speed would depend on network latency.<p>Now consider another example:<p><pre><code>    // injected.js

    module.exports = function (request) {
      return function (url) {
        request.get(url, callback);
      }

I routinely give this advice, but if you looked at the majority of our development work we get paid weekly per resource.  Where we do value based pricing (and where I suggest it) is not generally on active software development projects where we are slinging code.  Instead, we use it more where we are the experts brought in for training, education or business/technical reviews.  In that way your risk is significantly lower but the value to the client is, many times, much higher than your hourly wage would dictate.  For example, a business might easily pay $5,000 + travel expenses for a 3 day on-site training package that if you charged by the hour might net you $3k or so.<p>In some instances when we feel very confident of the project or the scope is extremely small, we will value price it so we can make a better margin.  Although I do this less and less if there is every code being written.<p>Overall, the other comments are generally pretty accurate.  Hourly/weekly pricing tells the client they are paying for effort not a specific result as it will likely change based on their input (although this can still get ugly sometimes).  Additionally, any fixed rates generally lead to almost an unchecked scope creep that makes life unbearable for a small team.",1428329145

They didn't engage in pay-for-placements, so their search results were objective. They were fast (turns out people really value speed). And pagerank was somewhat better (I did comparisons at the time, and search quality was pretty similar - but google <i>felt</i> much better to use because of the other factors). The competing search engines were focussed on monetizing users, instead of doing something useful for them.<p>I think she's claiming that few startups are acting like google did. Yet, google would likely have succeeded as a YC startup, because YC emphasises ""building something people want"", as opposed to being driven by a business model.<p>YC <i>is</i> attempting to productize startups - to find the rules that maximize startup success. The experimental approach of ""lean startups""; trying something fast, then iterating; pivoting all seem to be sensible, and seem to be working. But whenever you have rules, there's possibilities in a complex world that escape them - and that may be where the greatest breakthroughs are.<p>It's true that young people are less familiar with real-world problems (in general, not just in the third world) - yet, many game-changing startups seems to have been founded by young people: apple, microsoft, google etc.<p>Personally, I very much like the idea of changing the world, doing something valuable and not just to make money.

2762414,comment,2760540,2762282,1,0,NY_Entrepreneur,,,"My remarks about women are dead on the center of the target.  If you don't understand that, then I'm sorry:  Read slowly and carefully and learn likely some very important information.  The information could save a life, yours, some woman you know and/or love, and/or some children.  NO JOKE.  I very much know just what the heck I'm talking about, very unfortunately.<p>Sure, not all women are like I described, but some surprisingly large fraction are.  I mentioned the Roman Catholic church as a source; review what you know about that church and add details for yourself.  Sorry you didn't know those things about women.  If you won't take this common wisdom from me, then take it from the writers of the second 'Jurassic Park' as I noted.  The fraction of such women is so large that my description is a good candidate to explain what the author is saying.  That is, she wants to 'save the world' and wants SV to do so also.<p>Deliberately refusing to understand women is foolish down to dangerous down to fatal.  Literally.  Do I have to give you names, circumstances, dates, and where the tomb stones are?<p>Just because some women are as I described does not mean that no men are.  Okay, some men can be similar.<p>For your ""duty"", you are imagining things.  You have no such 'duty' at all.  None.  Zip, zilch, zero.  If following what that 'duty' would say is something you want to do, then go for it, but no one, neither you nor anyone else, should agree that you have a 'duty'.  You have no such 'duty'.<p>For 'innovation', I've been there, done that, am doing it now.  I'm doing a startup.  I'm in NY, not SV, but I have a list of a dozen or so VCs in SV who are eager to see my software run and be ready for users.<p>Your claims of 'corruption' are out of some vulnerability to 'morality' plays, of some old claims that humans are evil, sinful, do transgressions, get retribution, and need redemption with sacrifice -- and now we will have the choir sing while we pass the offering plate.  But I'm not ""corrupted"" at all.  SV has done nothing to 'corrupt' me.<p>My 'innovation' is some original research in applied math with some theorems and proofs based on some advanced prerequisites in pure and applied math.  Only a small fraction of university math profs have all the prerequisites; the fraction among computer science profs is much lower; the fraction among information technology entrepreneurs is still much lower, essentially at zip, zilch, and zero.  So, my work is, if only being so rare, 'innovative'.  It is also 'innovative' because it provides a new and powerful way for software to work with 'meaning' of quite general 'media content' as humans understand it although uses techniques much different than humans do.  Maybe, if from my applied math and corresponding software my Web site becomes worth $150 billion from being by far the world's best at search, discovery, recommendation, subscription, and curation for about 2/3rds of the content on the Internet. then you will be convinced that my work is 'innovative'.<p>So it's fair for me to say I'm 'innovating'.  So, SV has not kept me from 'innovating'.  SV has not 'corrupted' me.<p>But absolutely, positively SV and VCs make no attempt to look at my research as part of evaluating the financial potential of my project.  As I outlined, in biomedical VC, NSF, NIH, DARPA, ONR, etc., the situation is wildly different.  And THAT is where I would criticize SV and VCs and agree with the article.  I said that.<p>""Duty"", ""corrupt"" -- you sound a bit 'moralistic'!  Calm down.  Cool off.  Relax.  Have a beer.  Watch a movie.<p>For more on what's wrong with SV, it's not just the VCs who are not qualified compared with 'project sponsors' at NSF, NIH, DARPA, ONR and at the biomedical VCs; in addition the information technology (IT) entrepreneurs nearly never have the 'right stuff'.  Sorry 'bout that.<p>As I've explained often enough, bluntly, frankly, 'computer science' is out'a gas and not the main path to the future of computing or IT entrepreneurship.  Sorry 'bout that.  For 'computer science', it's trivial down to junk think.<p>The bedrock and crucial content of the future of computing is from:  Let me have the envelope please:  Here is it:  ""Advanced pure and applied math."".  Period.  Sorry 'bout that.<p>E.g., at Stanford, f'get about the Computer Science department, look up D. Luenberger, and study, say,<p>David G. Luenberger, 'Optimization by Vector Space Methods', John Wiley and Sons, Inc., New York.<p>which is fun and profit mostly from the Hahn-Banach theorem.<p>Again, there is a fundamental problem:  Only a tiny fraction of people can start really successful businesses.  So, only a tiny fraction of people will know in good terms what the good directions are for the future.  So, anyone with such understanding will necessarily be rarely understood and nearly always rejected.<p>For what is wrong with SV, I outlined it, but the details of my view are likely not widely shared.  In particular, I doubt that the author of the article or many people upvoting this thread would say that the future of computing is much more in<p>David G. Luenberger, 'Optimization by Vector Space Methods', John Wiley and Sons, Inc., New York.<p>etc. than in computer science.<p>Right away, don't expect to accept what I'm saying easily.  Still, rejection is dangerous:  You have to consider very carefully because I might be right!",1310638853

Coming from the beautifully designed homepage, it looks like a completely different site. Why don't you just add the facebook connect button on the homepage? Saves me a click and keeps it beautiful.<p>Once connected, it lists events by default by Popular. The problem is that some of the most popular events in my Facebook feed are in the past. Since your focus is on getting people out, I'd not even list past events. Just sort future events by popularity and filter by location, friends and time.<p>I just noticed the buttons at the bottom of the screen. I don't know how they look on a phone but on my computer screen, they are almost invisible. You might want to change the colour a bit.<p>On a particular event's page, the text is almost unreadable, as you'd expect from grey text on a grey background. This seems to be the most common annoyance I spot on well-designed websites. Maybe designers can perceive tiny differences in shades of colours, but most normals like me can't.<p>I'm not sure what the search function is for. It doesn't return any results for my friends' names, even when I can see events listed by them.<p>[Edit: In the list of events, it doesn't show me which friend of mine has created the event. Putting a picture of my friends' faces next to each event will make me hugely more likely to click on them.]<p>[Edit: Your blog doesn't link back to your main site. If I launched an app every time I spotted this on a startup blog, I'd be the appiest man in the world.]<p>One social problem with this kind of listing of events is that while it's cool to see what events my wider circle of friends are attending, it's not very useful unless I've been invited. (edit: and if I've been invited, umm your app is not very useful.) If I can see Sally is going to the music festival next Sunday in the park near my house, that's cool but I won't join her unless she invites me or she's a really good friend who won't mind me turning up.<p>Which brings me to the main problem with the concept of this app. Your taglines are:<p><i>Dont know where to go and whom with? Discover what your friends are up to!</i><p>The first one (where to go) is often a question I have. Whom with? Never. I mostly go out with the same set of friends and their friends. Discovering what my friends are up to is not hard with Twitter, Facebook, SMS, email or a phone call.<p>I haven't yet seen or used an app which recommends me things to do based on my interests and the events I've <i>been</i> to. Maybe Foursquare does this. I should try it out, but its focus (check-ins to get free beers) is something I'm not too interested in.<p>If you made something which actually tells me really fun stuff to do (my kind of fun), I'd use it, even if the design was fugly.

The problem is, programmers don't click ads.  So what did the guy do?  he threw in some pages about 'free MP3 downloads'  with some free mp3s on there... of legal, free music that nobody wants, of course, but he makes orders of magnitude more money from the ads on that page, that page that ranks highly (because it's on a high pagerank site, and because it's got all the keywords) but that has no content that anyone actually wants.<p>I mean, personally, I don't have a problem with making money misdirecting people who search for ""free MP3s""  -  but it does make google objectively worse.",1283245182

1648823,comment,1648578,1648578,0,0,sunkencity,,,"It took me about 5 minutes to get started writing code.<p>For some people programming can make sense, for others it's just a craft that's in the hands. When I was at the university lots of people struggled with ""understanding"" programming and they wrote little code, trying to more to come to terms with what programming is rather than trying to do it. The people that succeeded in learning to program wrote lots of code even though it was hard to write the code and to understand. Some of the people that didn't never entered their programs into computers and just ran the code by hand on a piece of paper (to what practical use is that?).<p>For me programming is in the hands. When I learn a new programming language it's total chaos for 1-2 weeks and then the new regime settles and I can understand what I have been doing. After half a year of being exposed to a new programming language even more of the teachings settle and I can begin understanding more, but programming it's a practical art. I suppose it can be different if you are more mathematically minded than I am.<p>I suggest doing ALL the exercises in a programming book - as fast as you can without trying to really understand what is going on behind the scenes. The secret is that you don't have to really understand what the hell is going on behind the scenes, you just have to know enough to stay out of trouble and that knowledge comes from experience. In the beginning of a programming career it'll be impossible to guess what weird bugs might occur so just code and see what happens.<p>In short, <i>you have to have a lot of practical knowledge of programming to support your theoretical knowledge</i>, otherwise you cannot do anything with either. A chicken and egg situation, so it's best just to jump into the deep waters and try to swim to the surface.",1283244764

It uses a yahoo web service to look up prices for them. It collects the data in an object. I pass that to a formatter. Then I print it.

Most programming ""problems"", like any other engineering field, have already been solved, so there's no shame in turning to a search engine or even better, StackExchange, for solutions. The best coders are the ones that are learning all the time.<p>On the other hand, there is usually an impedance mismatch between the description of the problem and the actual solution. Take a look at the horror stories on The Daily WTF. <a href=""http://thedailywtf.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://thedailywtf.com/</a><p>Anyway, try to read as much code as possible, both good and bad, find a mentor(s), be able to take constructive criticism, and just persevere, and you should be fine.",1283241939

Your style will decide whether you will be called a spammer.<p>For example dropbox.com became a huge success because Drew Houston started serving Digg-""Easter Eggs"" inside of dropbox to the Digg crowd that in turn gladly upvoted him. I find his approach very smart (they came out of nowhere) and I think dropbox would have not taken off without it.<p>It's always the same. When you think it's spam, it's spam.

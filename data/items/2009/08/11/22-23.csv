On the other hand, if kids were set up in a system that expected them to be self-sufficient by 15 and started towards that at 8, then they would be self-sufficient by 15.<p>If you look at the last 60-70 years, you see that kids become adults later and later.  My grandparents were married and on their own in their late teens (15-17 years old).  My parents were in their early 20s.  My generation seems to average around the end of college.  The current generation (my sisters) are approaching 25 and still not making the transition.<p>This is worrisome for me, since I've got my own kids coming through that process.  I know my 15 year old could succeed, but there is no way the societal infrastructure would let him.  I worry more about my other kids who aren't as self-aware as he his.<p>I can say that I totally agree that a huge part of the problem is that kids are kept in the kid group until, one day, they are just expected to flip the switch and be adults.

I didn't go on my own, since researching the route would have been very time consuming, and I'm too weak to push both myself and my luggage up a hill. I went with a touring company, America by Bicycle, instead. I highly recommend them. Their website's www.abbike.com. It doesn't look professional, but it's run by a bunch of cyclists who know what they're doing.<p>(But given the nature of this site, I wish I could post something really intellectual or otherwise related to hacking instead.)<p>-----<p>Addenda:<p>very frequently asked questions:\nWhat was the mileage per day?\nAbout 80 miles. The shortest day was 38 miles, the longest was 120.<p>What was the group size?\nAbout 50. The average age was 58, which surprised me. I expected to see a bunch of retired people, but I was the only recent college grad. The youngest person was a girl who had just graduated from high school; the oldest was an 80 year old man.<p>What was your fitness level prior to the ride?\nI ran at the gym for maybe 10 minutes, perhaps every other week. I was not especially fit, had never done any sports and was generally unathletic. Imagine my surprise when the tour booklet came two and a half months before I was to leave, recommending a year of training prior to the ride. =( Anyway, I put in about 1000 miles of training in those two and a half months. I was so afraid they would kick me out for being unfit that I didn't even dare ask them if they had that policy, lest it be true. It was pretty dumb of me to worry, in retrospect, since they'll just pick you up in a van if you can't make it to the next checkpoint, but I wanted the trip so badly that I avoided the thought of failure as much as possible.<p>How fast did you ride?\nThe strongest riders probably averaged 20 mph. I think the 80 year old man averaged 12-13 mph in the hilly places like Oregon. He was terribly slow at going up hills, but the descents made up for it a bit. I started out averaging 11-12 mph, but with lots of help and mentoring I moved up to 14-16, depending on the terrain and wind.",1250030629

If the brightness on the outside gets too high, they turn into a mirror and it's near impossible to see through. However if the brightness remains high on the inside, you can see through with perfect clarity.<p>So long as the back lighting can get brighter than the fore lighting, the glossy screen can be amazing. It has a few problems, like glares (where reflections and such cause light levels to peak higher than the back light), however these are really only a problem if you have to max out your back light.<p>Apple should be designing their laptop screens like they do their iPod screens. My brightness on my iPod is set to ~0% and inside it is perfect, even for most tv shows (no dark moody movies though), and outside I rarely need to put it up to 100% on the sunniest of days.

Large clients get little bits of spec work done for them which, on the whole, are not very useful in an of itself. To actually <i>get the work done</i> they will still need to pick a winning bidder and pay them fairly for the work.<p>In other words, the invested effort vs. the potential reward is pretty favorable for the design firm. For one thing, you're not competing against 50,000 other people on the interwebs, and secondly there's no danger of the client ""stealing"" your work - since they themselves would have little use for what amounts to an insignificant portion of the grand project.<p>That's a pretty key difference - in this case Ferriss has not promised a contract to the winning bidder, and what he is asking for is <i>complete</i> work directly. This strikes me as unfair. Where the traditional spec-work model is supposed to be a ""try before you buy"" thing, Ferriss is simply asking for <i>a bunch of free, final copies</i> to be produced for him gratis.",1250030150

756558,comment,755833,756238,0,0,splat,,,"I'll agree with your semantics.  To me, ""beating a game"" implies that you can consistently come out ahead over a long period of time.  Nevertheless, playing an ""unbeatable"" game over a short period of time is not necessarily irrational.  Although your expected value in your first version of the hat game is -$9901, you are <i>not</i> losing $9901 every time you play.  If you play long enough it will average out to be this, but every time you play you will either win $1 or lose $10,000.  If the chance of a devastating loss is negligible, it's hardly unwise to make a gamble, even if it has a negative expected value--this is why we occasionally do risky things that have a small chance of killing us, like driving or eating sushi.  The problem in thinking in terms of an expected value is that an expected value presupposes many trials--given a single experiment, it's a meaningless concept.  Indeed, given a single experiment, both the classical and frequency interpretations of probability are meaningless with regards to what the probability of a given outcome really is.  In the case of a single experiment, the only interpretation that makes sense is the Bayesian interpretation.<p>I would not play your second game, but the reason I wouldn't has nothing to do with expected values (notwithstanding the fact that it's technically impossible to calculate an expected value for an unquantifiable outcome like death).  In your first game, I feel that I would come out ahead, and in the second game I feel like it's not worth it.",1250028448

Yes, it comes from less experienced designers, and it comes with some additional problems (like the unpredictability of follow-on work, which may or may not be of reasonable quality and may or may not be available from the same designer at all).  But, for one-off design work, like a logo, it's simply the best way for a small business to get design work done quickly and cost-effectively.<p>When times get tough, as in a recession, folks often start looking for people to blame for their own reduced income.  Some folks blame immigrants, and this is just an indirect version of that...blaming foreigners for working too cheap and cheapening their trade by accepting these contest terms.  Because the reality is that most of the designers taking part in $250 contests are overseas.<p>The funny thing is that software shops have historically gotten some flack for using design contests and such...but the fact is software development was among the first to experience this pressure from cheap overseas white collar human resources.  We hackers have been dealing with it far longer than designers, and though a few among us belly-ache and bitch and moan, most of us have embraced the differences and compete on quality and taste rather than price.<p>In other words: Tim Ferriss, while possibly an asshole on other occasions and for other reasons, is <i>not</i> acting like an asshole by holding a design contest.",1250028433

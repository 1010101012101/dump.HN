You should be very likely to win them, yes, but when you lose them, you get penalized harshly for it.  It's kind of like betting on a roulette table that has no zeros (eg, no 'house advantage') on every number except for 36.  You are likely going to win (probability 35/36), but your winnings are very low (36/35), and so the expected value of the bet is still no gain (35 * 36) * (36 / 35) - 1.  Occasionally, you lose all of your money.

1431948,comment,1431540,1431907,0,0,jsyedidia,,,"You said you were interested in methodological ideas, so I'm going to add another comment. Based on the head-to-head rankings of MIT versus other top schools, it looks like MIT should have an Elo rating on your scale somewhere around 1800, which would give it a ranking somewhere around #4, which seems intuitively reasonable.<p>But it is possible that MIT loses more than it should (if it were 1800) against much lower ranked colleges (e.g. Boston University (Elo 1434), which your site gives winning against MIT 28% of the time). What might be happening is that MIT accepts some fraction of students who are weaker academically for a variety of reasons, but those students are intimidated by MIT's reputation for being academically intense, and decide not to attend. My guess is that among strong students (e.g. students with higher SAT scores), MIT's rating would be much higher than among all students.<p>This is also consistent with your suggestion that Avery et.al. used students from elite high schools.<p>So if you want to get ratings that are more in line with what people think of the colleges (e.g. where is a good student who gets into both A and B likely to go) you should probably consider students who have high SATs, or alternatively students who get into a lot of top-ranked colleges, to be more ""valuable"" and thus to be more important for the rating.",1276582985

Stuff like the boe-bot and others. They will allow you to get your feet wet with electronics and circuit design.<p>After you have the basics down, you can start looking at the tutorials that SparkFun has for example to get some basic circuits out, and building them, learn how to solder (screwing up when you have 20 boards made is not that big of a deal, buy SparkFun's broken boards and play with them, I learned how to solder from my professor and have always had extremely neat boards).<p>Just take your time, and don't rush it. It is an absolutely blast to create your first circuit with an LED and blink it with a microcontroller.<p>The one thing I will mention is, get ready to decipher all kinds of data sheets to get the information you need so you don't accidentally burn up your electronic parts.",1276582309

It is possible that this is bug driven. It is also possible that over the past year we have accumulated enough data that MIT is now clearly more favored by our users than previously (since the head to head matchups are realtime and the Elo points are precomputed, these two approaches are currently using quite different data). If true, this would be reflected by an increased Elo score for MIT when 2010 gets computed. There is also the admittedly odd possibility that MIT does better vs better colleges, though I find this possibility fairly unlikely.<p>I'll look for bugs, as you suggest, since I'm going to be re-running the algorithm again in the coming weeks.<p>Edit: After thinking more about my beliefs about MIT not really being comparable with your average college, I'll add another possibility: perhaps MIT is simply engaged in fewer matches against weaker opponents, collecting fewer ""free"" points than HYP?",1276582244

I'm now exclusively Rails, but also have toyed with C# in the past.<p>As for projects, I have many ideas in my arsenal but as of now only one is being actively developed; however it isn't giving me the kind of passion I had when I came up with the idea about a year ago.",1276582126

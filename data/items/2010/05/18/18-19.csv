The more popular a website is, the more casual viewers it will attract.  The fact that justin.tv has such a high viewership time may have more to do with the fact that its audience is tiny, and that viewers kind of have to consciously seek it out.  As opposed to youtube, which is one of those timewasters you go to without really thinking.

1358556,comment,1357896,1358256,0,0,dpatru,,,"The work done to build a robot is amortized over all the robots built. So I think it will be cheaper. Factory robots do replace workers because they are cheaper. Humans can do high quality paint jobs too. It just probably takes them longer, or maybe humans need multiple tries because they mess up more often. The point is, no factory owner will invest in new technology if it didn't make economic sense. Quality is not orthogonal to price.<p>A mower robot could also be safer. A person riding a mower is exposed to a lot of noise, sun, and shaking. If you are relatively disabled or have a bad back, you can't operate a mower. Just about anyone who can see, on the other hand, could operate a mower remotely. No exposure to noise, to dust, to sun, to bumps. Also, you would want to err on the side of safety, so if the robot is in any way unsure of itself (say because there are moving objects nearby) it should just shut off and wait for human guidance. Some jobs, like mowing, cleaning, planting, harvesting, etc, can easily be stopped with no problems. On the other hand, you wouldn't want to just shut down a car in traffic when something goes wrong.<p>If people can attend meetings in another country remotely, why couldn't they also push around a vacuum cleaner or pick strawberries remotely? This would avoid all the costs of travel and food and boarding in a foreign country. Rather than immigrants working illegally in the US, they could be operating machines in the US from their home countries.<p>Janitors already travel from building to building to clean the floors. If they could operate the cleaning equipment from home, why wouldn't they? Physically transporting a person is more expensive than transporting information, and the gap between the two will only widen.<p>It seems to me that the hard part is remote controlling the robot so that it can move around while not hurting itself and other people. The Anybot robot is already semi-autonomous in this sense. Once you have this basic feature in place, it's straightforward to add other capabilities.",1274208723

Hidden menus were very frustrating, and the clunky keyboard implementation meant I tried for voice recognition. Firstly, it sends voice recognition to Google (what! Voice recognition on the iPhone blows the Android experience out of the water due to this alone), but we need the navigation immediately (as we realised en-route we needed to stop somewhere else).  Then the Android just hangs and gets stuck on some ""please wait"" screen.<p>I have never seen an iPhone get stuck randomly unless it's a hard crash.  Then I needed to figure out how to 'reset' the map app -- another exercise in frustration.  Ultimately it proved easier to use my iPhone and read the directions out myself.  It basically sums up every experience I've had with Android - frought with frustration and unnecessary problems.",1274208362

1358511,story,,,6,5,oms2010,"Ask HN: Review my app: www.organizemysearch.com",,"Hi HN,<p>I have been working on a personal project for some time called organizemysearch.com.<p>I came up with it because I got tired of having to manage used car searches while looking for a car. I'm the type of person who likes to do lots of research before buying something (eg. I spent about 2-3 months each weekend looking for my last car, seeing options and comparing. And it was worth it. I got a great deal).  But, while doing this research I end up saving tons of links from across different sites like craigslist.org, cars.com, autotrader.com and it gets messy after a while.<p>So I created organizemysearch.com to allow you to save and organize links whenever you are searching for an item (Eg. a used car, an apartment rental,etc). The critical feature is that it recognizes and parses out data for you if you paste in a link from one of the websites that it monitors.<p>Example: If you find a car ad on craigslist.org, cars.com or autotrader.com, the application will parse out all data like price, miles, make and model for you. You can then save each ad you find interesting from several websites, and have all the options you are considering in one place, so you can make a decision easier.<p>I also plan to add some other functionality in the future (if the site grows):\n- firefox extension so you can add links directly from the browser\n- checking if an ad you saved has been taken down already (eg not available anymore)\n- charts for comparing all the items/options you find in a visual way<p>I'm not very good at graphic design, so I don't expect any thumbs up, but I would really appreciate your honest feedback on the concept and functionality, and any other thoughts you may have to make it more useful (if you do find it useful that is :-) ).<p>You can log in with a test account: hn/hn",1274207946

And it comes down to the granddaddy of modern slot math: the IGT/Telnaes patent (US 4,448,419).<p>The idea is simple: if you have three reels on a machine with 11 symbols and 11 blanks in between those symbols, there are only 10,648 outcomes (22 x 22 x 22) when there is an equal chance of stopping somewhere on a reel (local gaming laws usually dictate this to be ""fair"" to the player).  Assuming one combination is the ""jackpot"" position, that still only means you can pay out less than 10,648 times what you got in...if you want to stay profitable.<p>Telnaes proposed a radical change: let's make the reels <i>virtual</i>, which a much higher number of stops per reel (say, 1000).  Then let's map those positions to spots on the physical reel.  Voila!  Now you have a billion possible outcomes.  You can award higher jackpots.  The gaming board is happy since the virtual reels are still evenly spaced.<p>The gaming companies eventually realized those mappings don't need to be equally spaced to be legal.  So now every one of those losing outcomes can be mapped to BAR-BAR-space, if you want.  Oooooh, so close.  You almost had it.  But in reality, you were miles away.",1274207305

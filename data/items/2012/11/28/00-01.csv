4840326,comment,4836057,4837824,2,0,ekianjo,,,"Maybe this is just that we are dealing with different businesses? I am sure there are indeed some businesses like the ones you describe where ""building the app"" is the only thing they care about. I was just saying that the idea of ""Experience"" instead of ""Product/App"" has been floating around for a long time in many different fields. When you book a trip somewhere, the travel agent does not go into describing each particular aspect of the trip, they try to make you imagine what it's like to be there. When you go in Disneyland, everything is made to make you feel like you step in their world. Advertisers know this very well and their whole business is about creating experiences out of products.<p>So, my point is that this narrative is very, very well known and I think this was already described in marketing books from the 60s-70s but this is just out of memory. So, that is why I said this is nothing really new.",1354064382

I've worked with rails for about 5 years and Django for a little over 16 months now. There's some things I do and don't like respectively for each framework.<p>I suggest testing each out and see which you prefer. Ruby and Python are similar languages but different enough that you'll want to spend some time learning each. Both will benefit you in the long run, as I work with ruby and python daily and is useful knowing both.<p>I will warn you that Django was easier for me to pick up than rails. Rails guys (me included) tout how easy it is to get going with rails, which is true. However, getting really good with rails is hard. Knowing exactly what's going on and why, how to extend ActiveModel or ActionController properly, monkey patching, proper testing practices, etc are quite the time sink, albeit a beneficial one in my opinion. I think if you have TDD or a client adamant about full test coverage, I've found rails support and practices are more flushed out than django's take.<p>EDIT: typos",1354064282

4840310,comment,4840012,4840012,2,0,graue,,,"At the end, the author suggests getting an iPod Touch. A friend I just visited in NYC does this. My friend has an iPod Touch he uses to make Google Voice calls when wifi is available (which is most of the time). He also has a dumbphone for making calls/texts when they're absolutely necessary and wifi isn't available. The dumbphone is prepaid with a very small allowance of minutes and costs him $10/mo.<p>I felt inspired by this setup, but the truth is I do rely on using Google Maps when in unfamiliar places, and that requires a data connection. To a lesser extent, finding local business listings/reviews without wifi comes in handy, too. I don't need it all the time, but when I do, these features are crucial.<p>If it were possible to refine my friend's idea by using only one device (say an unlocked Nexus 4), and getting a small prepaid data plan as well (say 500MB/mo), I'd consider doing the same. Does that exist?",1354064113

4840306,comment,4838215,4840212,1,0,gfodor,,,"Yeah I was more pointing out that the things touched upon in an interview environment for inexperienced and experienced engineers can be wildly different. For inexperienced engineers, the interview can be spent talking about ""new"" technology, ""new"" ideas, and so on with excitement (despite the fact these things might altogether not be new or may be flawed.) For experienced engineers, at least in my experience, interviews tend to be more sobering and focused on blowing holes in ideas and talking about how they were bit by such-and-such an issue.<p>It's a hard balance. In the long haul, you often want people who are careful and diligent and have experience that tempers their urge to jump into things too quickly. But, this type of attitude can actually hurt in startups. In an interview where the particular 3 or 4 things you touch upon are extrapolated (correctly or not) to be the main self-identifying traits of how you work and how you think about problems, if you tell even just one story about superior databases from the 70's or seem to be overly-pedantic when it comes to blowing holes in ideas this can be a 'red flag.'<p>In a startup environment, I'd rather have the engineer who I think will fall in a hole 3 times and figure out a solution eventually than another who I think will think too hard and fall in one in 3x the time due to their fear built up from previous failures. In an interview, if I am spending my time with the person mostly talking about things that have gone wrong and how everything new is old, I will worry they will be too paralyzed to just hack on and break things -- and this type of focus, while obviously invaluable in many situations, tends to come from more experienced engineers since they have seen more shit go wrong.",1354064053

As a geek, I research every part of a computer I am building thoroughly. I read reviews, compare specs and prices, run it by friends on tech message boards for opinions, etc. When the time comes to play Skyrim on uber settings on the machine I built, I get more enjoyment out of it, and feel satisfied in knowing that the components in it won't melt.<p>Same mindset applies to my other hobbies. I always try to get the best and most reliable matches when I go cross-country backpacking, because if a storm comes and I need to light a fire, I want to make sure the matches won't fail me. Last month I bought a new set of tires for my commuter bike, and I did actually get the most tires because for the types of trips I make, it matters.<p>In contrast, I don't give a crap about things that don't relate to hobbies. I moved to a new apartment recently and was in need of a new trash bin. I went to the nearest Walmart (conveniently located across the across the street) and purchased the cheapest one that had a lid.

(You need a pad as large as the text you want to encrypt; the pad <i>must</i> be really random; you must <i>never</i> reuse the pads; you have to get the pads to the person doing the encrypting and decrypting.)<p>And then they learn a bit more and one of the simplifications they learn is to XOR a bit of text with a string; they encrypt plaintext with a key.  This is not a real crypto system, it's just a silly little demonstration.<p>But a disturbing number of people seem to stop there and say something like ""Let's use XOR and a secret key and it's a bit like a OTP so super secure!!"" but they forget that you must have a pad as large as the plain text.<p>So their crypto system is really very very weak.<p>Other DRM systems have been broken, but usually by smart people working hard with advanced techniques.<p>I could have broken this system.<p>The other thing that's bad about it is that it is ridiculously easy to intercept the decrypted files and copy those.<p>So they've sold a system to small un-clueful content distributors and they've used hyperbole to do so.<p>And the law prevents us from telling those content distributors because we're not allowed to circumvent a technical copyright protection method.",1354063888

A huge fraction (imo) of the apps available in the app-stores did not need to go native mobile.<p>Mobile app-stores have mountains of apps that really have nothing mobile specific about them. This astounds me. Yet developers spent serious time/effort building these native apps. Why? I suspect it is the web-noise that continually dangles stats about gazzillion smartphone app downloads that triggers a greed hormone in philosophers and scientists alike, which begins to make them see mobile everywhere.<p>I am not suggesting that there's no need to address the form-factor issue. Only that ""native mobile"" of the app-store variety is frequently not a good strategy. Certainly not, as you point out, as a first-option.<p>Aside: You state ""you need to be where your customers are"". Yes, but if you define customers as those that play a role in generating revenue (either by paying directly for services rendered, or by permitting you to arbitrage someway), is mobile the place to be? This is obviously only a rhetorical question...you address this in your original article. I am just a bit outraged that the ios store has a million deluded worker bees building apps for it when they won't see a penny.

I read (possibly misread) it in this context as meaning that you have to demonstrate this in some more extreme way if you're old. That, to me, is pandering to bigotry.<p><i>The fact is, most of the older people I know (my parents, grandparents, etc) still listen to the music they were listening to at age 25. Many of them (such as my aunt) are still working at jobs that use technologies they learned 30 years ago. It's not because they are incapable of evolving. I think it is because they never made it a point to sharpen their openness & curiosity.</i><p>I know people like that. My experience has been though that those people are just as inflexible in their 20s as they are in their 50s. It's just that it's trickier to spot - because they've been stuck for a shorter period of time.<p>If you're in your twenties and look around your peers now I bet you'll find some folk who are still really into the same bands they were into when they were in their teens. They'll still be into those bands in 30 years time.<p><i>My solution personally is to try to constantly force myself to understand and appreciate the zeitgeist of music, programming, and design as I age. In terms of personal empowerment, it seems to me one of the most sensible routes to fight ageism.</i><p>That's a fantastic approach to living an interesting and fulfilling life.<p>It's a lousy strategy to fight ageism.<p>Ageism is what <i>others</i> do to you.

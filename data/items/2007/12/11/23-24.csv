88454,comment,88247,88247,0,0,nailer,,,"On the non-Linux front, Joyent's accelerators (on-demand scaling via virtualization) use OpenSolaris, with the virtualization being provided by grid containers (virtualized userspace on a shared kernel).<p>Joyent have a good reputation but I'm not a fan of Solaris ancient userspace tools - something as simple as checking the size of a disk is made complex by Solaris not bothering to include an 'h' option - so you have to count your terabytes of disk in kilobytes. <p>The Solaris filesystem layout is non-FHS and a rather odd mess, with binaries in var and etc, and variable files in usr.",1197417339

If there is 1 quarter of decline, then 1 of gain, then another of decline, there is no recession.<p>My question about your startup would be along the lines of how you are getting paid - are you depending on online advertising, or is this a service you are going to sell someone?  Is there any chance you can have 1 or 2 customers ready to pay you something, even a token amount, while it is in ""late-alpha"" stage?",1197415840

I've heard that this was the spot on the west coast to get good coffee (long before good coffee was much of a concept in most of the US).  Anyone know a spot that gets it right?",1197415460

88445,comment,88005,88337,0,0,politrix,,,"It's often the dumb ones who take the stance on discussing other people's intelligence. There is a wealth of circumstances and complexity of the issue that never crosses this posters mind, yet he is quick to make definitive claims of such gravity. Racism has the interesting tendency of exposing the fools even amongst the most educated individuals.<p>Oh, where would I start... The structure of the brain? Our understanding and concept of what is ""intelligence""? Nonexistentent genetical variation between the so called ""races"", which are themselves based on fallacious premises? The theory of races after all started in Germany as measured by the differences in the shapes of skulls, and was mainly categorized as an issue of beauty. With Germans obviously appointing themselves (aryans) the most graceful and beautiful ""race"" of them all. And now people are trying to retrofit genetic explanations on such an old theory based purely on pseudo-science? There is at maximum 5-15% genetic variation between the continental populations, and note that this is not the same as our naive notions of ""race"". There is less genetic variation in humans than in any other mammalian species. Worldwide genetic variation in humans is less significant than in 2 closely related chimpanzee species having evolved closely together in western Africa, to give you some magnitude for comparison. 90% of the genetic variation occurs on a <i>local</i> level as opposed to globally, if you can wrap your head around what that means? And every instance of ""child genius"" that has been studied has boiled down to no innate ability, but rigorous practice from an early age. Meaning that ""intelligence"" is largely learned, mind is an empty plate of neurons waiting to be connected. The only thing conceivably affecting their training are chemical balances, malnutrition, toxicity of the environment, and so on...<p>Basing your theories directly on empirical evidence about the economies of the world obviously can't factor in all the relevant facts. You say that all the African countries with no whites are poor? Did you know that a lot of them have been paying the debts created by the colonialists ever since they were ""liberated""? Do you know how the West still sponsors guerillas and pays diamond merchants in many parts of Africa? Only a secluded mind could have such delusions of grandeur. I recommend debating with some intellectual and educated black scholars.",1197415019

I think there's a saying. . . something like ""A students end up working for C students.""  <p>I've always wondered where that leaves B students.  I have no ideas how many A's I earned, exactly, but I do recall my GPA to a vague notion of a range between 3 decimal places.",1197414979

I mean it is the cradle of the civilization after all. But you wouldn't think that way today with a lot of that history having been nearly eradicated and not taught.",1197414399

Most of the remaining work to do before we launch is superficial, just refining the UI and ""making it pretty"".  We have been actively seeking money, but have gotten blank stares from investors when we explain that we have kept our day jobs thus far.

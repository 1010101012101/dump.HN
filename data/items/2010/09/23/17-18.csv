Once I figured out how to make all wood tools to get better resources, It was over man. I've now made like 5 different homes, and learned how to mark them from the spawn point. My memories of exploration and mining trump those of my daily duties in real life. My latest story was of mining a sub basement of my home, and discovering a vast underground cavern with zombies. I died, and lost that homes location. In the effort to find it, I discovered new land, with more features that replicated the movie Avatar. I have picked the tallest mountain in the clouds for my next project.

MySpace was not a technology company, Facebook is. MySpace was primarily a media company with little to offer technologically (see: <a href=""http://paulgraham.com/yahoo.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://paulgraham.com/yahoo.html</a>), Facebook is building a social web that has deep horizontal integration with the Social Graph Protocol, mobile communication, and is actively trying to optimize it's infrastructure for both scalability and user experience. Look as far back to their decision to go with AJAX and not base everything strictly on page loads (as MySpace did), or as recent as their open sourced internal projects... (I don't think MySpace ever worked on any HipHop PHP or Cassandra)<p>Facebook is in it with the right mindset, to be the leader and game changer in the ""social web,"" and with both the value and quantity of data they are constantly amassing I wouldn't be surprised to see them on par with Google in a few years.<p>Also, as they grow they can continue to optimize and decrease costs on their end... I'd say they have both a big faucet to open and probably a few leaks they could plug as well, the combination of which makes for a large valuation to be expected.<p>It's always easier to look at something we don't quite fully understand from the outside (not many people understood the true value of those little text ads on Google until later) and then make blanket assumptions on valuations based on other companies that were inflated but not even on the same playing field as the company being discussed.",1285264375

If he can make 3k selling to teachers (a very narrow niche), he will make a boat load of money selling to businesses. Let's say in first year, he has 100 customers (a very conservative estimate) on 79/month plan. That's 7900$ in revenue. Next year he adds 200 customers more, now you are talking about revenue of 24k. In 5 years, he can easily make 50k/month with minimum effort on his side. This business can give him the lifestyle we all dream about.

The London BarCamps are also great, as are the Hack Days.<p>I also agree that the start up (and also the mobile) events aren't terribly useful. They are more of a nice place to relax in the company of like-minded individuals rather than places to generate business.<p>As for boozing... that's just London in the evening. Most people are bright enough to stick to one or two drinks and you still see everyone in the office at 7.30am the next morning.<p>By comparison I found events in New York to be a little free of personal interaction. You turn up, spend 5 minutes talking to 5 people, listen to a speaker, then go home. Great for collecting business cards, not so good for establishing solid relationships. Perhaps someone can suggest better events for me?",1285263114

The volume of Facebook trading is so low that when a large trade of it does occur, as in this additional investment that valued it at $33b, the price jumps wildly and it makes news.<p>As per the secondary market, Sharespost shows the last contract traded on their system being over 3 weeks ago, and that there are only 3 people willing to sell and 5 people willing to buy right now.  Those are pathetic numbers.<p>Granted, shares are not entirely illiquid either.

1720321,comment,1719975,1720151,0,0,lyudmil,,,"Doesn't it come down to who comes up with the price and what their motivation for investing is?<p>When a VC invests in a company, they're looking for a big exit. Essentially, they're trying to predict how much the company might IPO or get acquired for. A public investor is trying to predict the rise in future profits of the company. The difference in motivation matters when you consider a hypothetical.<p>Suppose the company is guaranteed to have stagnant or falling profits. Does that discourage the VC? Not necessarily. They don't care about whether the company can make money. They care about whether they can keep building <i>perceived</i> value in the eyes of anyone who would want to acquire. A public investor, however, would not put their money in that company (at least not for long).<p>Therefore, I think David's main point is sound - VC's are more likely to over-value your company than the market is. We also know this to be true because of what happened in the early 2000's.",1285261313

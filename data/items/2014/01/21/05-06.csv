Drove it almost bankrupt. Jobs came back and indisputably saved the company from the brink of disaster, not by trying to play the same game as Microsoft, but again by pursuing visionary projects.<p>Jobs&#x27; refusal to compromise and &quot;work with&quot; the sales guys who ran Apple into the ground... is maybe, just possibly, one of the reasons he ended up being one of the most successful guys in the history of the computing industry.",1390283885

7093718,comment,7093369,7093686,17,0,vubuntu,,,"I have heard this thousands of times, but a common man, a ordinary software engineer, does not have a lawyer on his speed dial. He/She may not even know how to go about finding one without spending at the least 10-15 mins on Google. So how does this work out? If one says &quot;I will only talk in the presence of a lawyer&quot;, then the officers say ok, you get your one phone call, go call your lawyer....then what?? Who do I call? Say best thing is to call my wife/friend and have them find and bring a lawyer.....but what if neither my wife/friend is immediately reachable and I waste my one phone call away....then what?? Are the officers obligated to provide me a &#x27;public&#x27; lawyer ?? It&#x27;s easy to say &quot;don&#x27;t talk ever without lawyer being present&quot; , but if I don&#x27;t know what to do after saying that, and I do know there is nothing to be hidden (100% sure) and have reasonable belief that they will let me go once they are convinced of that, then which do you think is an easier choice for me, especially in that panic/stressful mode??",1390283690

7093715,comment,7093016,7093633,2,0,SeanKilleen,,,"Hey there! Thanks for commenting. I think I commented on this aspect in a few other places on the thread, but while I glossed over the IT troubleshooting steps in my blog post, I&#x27;ve been in IT for 10+ years in the roles of support, sysadmin, and developer. I _of course_ did some troubleshooting. Two different PCs with internet connections that worked completely reliably both had different issues, and they were both in known stable states at the time. On each, I&#x27;d tested the internet connection, speed, etc. Nothing else was wrong with my internet connection at the time, at least in terms of things like loading web pages, downloads, and streaming HD video. In the first case, the speed seemed to drop to zero and then timeout. In the second, case the file took a long time to download and then came out corrupted anyway. I&#x27;m not saying these things don&#x27;t happen; but I&#x27;m saying that, if it&#x27;s a company&#x27;s bread and butter, it would make more sense to put as many safeguards in place to make sure that after 12+ hours, a corrupted file doesn&#x27;t happen.<p>Also, I&#x27;m aware that a few dropped packets can be an issue. This is why I used Backblaze&#x27;s advertised downloader application -- I got the impression that it would provide better stability, checking, etc. to ensure that the zip file did not get corrupted.<p>I also mention the external HDDs in my post, but my point is that I pay them so that I can restore my files conveniently, not so that I can be upsold to a $189 drive. Normally, I would drop the cash, but after just spending several hundred dollars on a new motherboard, I figured I would use their download mechanism, which is offered. I think I&#x27;m allowed to have a reasonable expectation that it would work.<p>With all that said, this is for sure not some &quot;grab your pitchforks!&quot; moment. I&#x27;m doing this partly to call attention to my own stupidity at putting my faith in one cloud backup provider, and also to highlight that Backblaze&#x27;s process for restoring could likely be a little bit smoother, given that this is when users would like things to be absolutely foolproof. I remain a fan of Backblaze&#x27;s CEO who was responsive when support wasn&#x27;t, and of the company itself which has done great things like open-sourcing its hardware.<p>I&#x27;ve since been in contact with support again and I will be sure to update my post once the matters are resolved.",1390283623

7093674,comment,7092762,7093189,8,0,jrockway,,,"I believe the speed increases are due to better beamforming algorithms, which use multiple fixed antennas to behave like one or more directional antennas at the same time.  The idea being that the antenna only sends power in a small cone to your device and only hears responses from inside that small cone.  This lets you fit many users onto the same frequency space, since they can&#x27;t hear each other and each have the full slice of spectrum and time to themselves.  It&#x27;s space multiplexing, as opposed to time and code multiplexing that&#x27;s currently widely used.<p>(The problem is that this requires really good digital signal processing.  Normally we make directional antennas by putting bits of metal around the driven element that pick up the signal and re-radiate it out of phase.  These work really well, and you probably have on on your roof to receive TV signals.  But beamforming does this all in software, using a number of actual antennas to radiate out-of-phase to increase power in a certain direction.  The reverse is true for receive; correlating phase information to &quot;hear&quot; a signal only from a certain direction.  One direction is easy, but 100 directions is hard.  That&#x27;s where better DSP equates to more &quot;bandwidth&quot; for mobile phones.)<p>802.11n contains rudimentary beamforming, but the state of the art for software signal processing on $5 commodity chips is not amazing, and of course, the 2.4GHz ISM band is basically unusable because there is so much interference from non-beamforming (etc.) devices. 802.11ac improves this incrementally with better hardware.  So it makes sense that at carrier grade budgets and with dedicated spectrum, good beamforming is possible.  If so, and that&#x27;s what this is, I totally believe 300MBps.<p>802.11ac has a 256QAM mode that can do almost 1Gbps.  Of course, on the 2.4GHz band, you&#x27;ll never hear 16 levels of signal over all the noise.  But with dedicated spectrum, things change.<p>(This is mostly secondhand knowledge, so take it with a grain of salt.  My cubemate at work is a WiFi expert :)  I&#x27;m just a ham who is happy making QSOs at 31.25baud with PSK31.",1390282603

Would the industry focusing on building better and better steam cars have been a waste? Would investing millions in developing an engine that was light enough to allow flight in heavier than air vehicles when we already have a dirigible/train/ship network that is perfectly adequate for passenger and good transport. \nPersonally I see this kind of work as needing to find &#x27;new&#x27; solutions to realise these kind of blue sky projects. Meanwhile applying ourselves to even quite meaningful works does not give us a new solution to apply to other problems it just fits an existing solution to an unsolved problem. It may benefit us more in the short term to apply the solutions we already have (some times in very novel ways) to solve existing problems but coming up with new ways to apply the same old solution to different areas becomes harder and harder as there are less problems it could apply to and the blue sky research may very much make those solutions, if not obsolete, an inefficient use of effort.",1390282337

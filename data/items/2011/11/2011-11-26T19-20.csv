The hardware is, optically, very crappy. Our image processing and integration software is very complex, much more complex than we really are able to understand at this time.<p>And it behaves almost nothing like a camera.  Even mechanically, the optical projection is very different than a camera makes, or what one would get from a linear perspective projection.<p>There is a projection, but the ""image"" is actually composed of multiple viewpoints over time. The adjustments an artist must make for small changes in the model's pose is nothing compared to the varying nature of the mental image you actually ""see"" inside your brain.  It is far from static, and is in fact very dynamic.<p>Which is why that drawing from life is considered much more important than drawing from a photograph when learning to see.<p>Note that I'm not knocking the study of structure or synthetic processes like linear perspective. They are important tools and aids in perception and image synthesis.  But a good drawing, or painting, or photograph for that matter, is not a mere 2D projection of light and dark. It is an encoded record of a multitude of  perceptions, or perception artifacts that your brain then interprets, inside it's magic ""seeing"" box, which then produces a simulacrum of a perceived event or process.<p>Else making a good drawing or photograph would be an entirely mechanical process that anyone could make by following a few simple rules.  Instead they are like moments of insight into a scene or event.<p>And all of this is relevant if you are creating software that is going to communicate visually.  When you are building your data structures and models inside your head, it is a very different from that which the experience the user has. Your job is to make the important aspects of that model manifest visually, and usefully manipulatable.",1322336796

Under California law (where I homeschooled some years back), one legal option to homeschool is to hire a tutor for 3 hours a day.  Not 8 hours, just 3. And there is good reason for that:  The one-on-one teaching model is far more intensive than the 8 hours a day where one teacher is splitting her attention amongst 20 to 40 students. Trying to do 8 hours a day of one-on-one instruction would be a good way to burn out everyone involved.<p>One book or article I read indicated that one homeschooling parent went and observed at school and concluded that only 1 to 3 hours out of the day was spent actually doing school work.  The rest was spent calling roll, getting in line, changing classes, going to lunch and so on.  It was less time and effort for me to homeschool than to send my kids to public school.

The idea that <i>any</i> politician is routinely dealing in truth is laughable... and I don't mean that so much in terms of cynicism <i>per se</i>, but because they really have very little incentive to do the necessary huge amounts of work it would take that would bring them no gain, or even less than no gain inasmuch as it would limit their verbal weaponry.<p>Just as one example of the sort of thing that makes it difficult for me to take Politifact ratings seriously in 30 seconds of browsing, look at: <a href=""http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/sep/22/mitt-romney/mitt-romney-repeats-claim-obama-went-around-world-/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/sep/...</a> Mitt Romney gets a ""pants on fire"" rating for claiming that Obama has apologized to the world for the US on various occasions. To my eyes, it's a desperate attempt to avoid the accusation by deliberately and stubbornly being as naive as possible, insisting that it wasn't anything remotely resembling an apology (""pants on fire"" remember, not just ""half truth"", which I would actually accept just fine on this matter) because it doesn't contain the word ""sorry"" and never quite fully says ""apology"". I call it ""naive"" because in politics everybody knows that there's more to what's going on that just what is being said; would Politifact expect me to be naive enough that when diplomats say they had the traditional ""frank exchange of views"" that means the negotiations are going well, because nobody said outright they were going poorly? <i>Of course</i> Obama never said ""I apologize for the US"", but there's rather more wiggle room for interpretation than giving someone who says there were an apology a ""pants on fire"" rating.<p>And to be perfectly clear, I see equally dubious straining-at-gnats attacks from conservatives on liberals as well routinely.

I do think that some of that information could be woven into your main page without raising the complexity of the page substantively. But of course those were all just questions that immediately rushed into my head when I first saw the page. Of course, I may not be typical of average customers.<p>Probably the most important things of that lot are that I suspect that even if you had no lower limit on what people could pay (so long as you suggested no minimum) that the number of people who paid <$1 would be negligible. So I wonder if it is the best use of space to even mention that. If 100 people only paid $0.50 would that actually be a problem? And secondly it isn't immediately 100% clear when you first see the page that you are a consortium of indie musicians. To be honest, I am not sure what the best way is to communicate that fact on the main page. But if you can communicate it, I think it adds value (because you are selling the real deal, art direct from real artists which is actually quite desirable to have) and it stops potential customers wasting their effort on trying to figure that out.<p>At the end of the day, because you are the first group to do this, you are probably going to get a good response. But next week, when there's 100 knock offs, how will you communicate that you are the real deal and everyone else is just peddling fakes? It's worth thinking about because you have an opportunity to cement a brand. Ideally, what you'd like by next week is for others to find that they can't sell music bundles unless they are you. And this will lead them to come to you to sell their bundles for them. :-)<p>Best of luck with the sale! I hope it goes really well for you guys. And congrats on being the first to get a music bundle off the ground!<p>P.S: I just noticed you've given away quite a bit of info on how you put this together, e.g. your platform, payment processor, lists you advertised this on, etc. I would not give this info away.

We solved the socialization issue by enrolling them in dance, martial arts, sports, theater and other structured social activities that allow them to socialize in a constructive environment.<p>The stigma of homeschooling is wearing off as more and more people see the product of homeschooling. To me the socialization was over-plaid where homeschoolers where branded as religious fundamentalist that where trying to segment themselves and their children off from society. The thing to remember when people say that it somehow damaged children is, that school is the unnatural environment.<p>The history of children being massed into an environment with few adults to supervise has a relatively short history. With further laws restricting those that do not want to be there from leaving, it has become a recipe for disaster. Before legislation mandating attendance, the bad apples naturally fell away from the environment, now that they are mandated to stay they have become a drag and influence on the ones that remained.<p>Why homeschooling is seen as an eccentric solution is beyond me, when it is becoming one of the few logical choices based on the overwhelming evidence available that public education is failing.",1322336153

I suspect that if the virus was released, because it is already so contagious, it could infect most of us within 10s of human-to-human transmission generations (especially if any of the early spreaders had a large number of contacts, or was well connected).<p>In that scenario, there's not going to be sufficient generations for the evolutionary adaptation to manifest.  (10s of human-to-human generations is vastly more virus copying generations; this doesn't matter, as the evolutionary effect in favor of less lethality occurs at a human level).<p>So, your argument would make sense to me, if we were considering the chances of a virus like this one naturally occurring; but that's not what the article is about.<p>>I suspect the world would go full ""madagascar"" (""shut...down...everything!"") if deaths reached more than 10 million.<p>Epidemics tend to either burn out, or grow exponentially. Exponential growth has strange consequences.<p>For something like an airborne and highly contagious flu, by the time 10 million people have died, it is way too late for any containment; at that stage maybe 1B are already infected.

Let me see if I can answer your questions.<p>1. We will probably release more detailed stats once the sale is over, but as of earlier today we've sold over 9,000 bundles.<p>2. It's a holiday sale because Black Friday through Cyber Monday is a popular time for there to be sales on things, especially digital items.<p>3. We have not offered this sale before. To our knowledge, there hasn't been a sale on a collection of game music like this before at all.<p>4. We are marketing the sale - not just by encouraging sharing on sites like Reddit, Facebook and Twitter, but also news stories on gaming websites like Kotaku, Joystiq, 1up, RockPaperShotgun, Destructoid, etc.<p>5. The deal is indeed 'pay what you want', a very successful model used by the Humble Indie Bundle (all video games), for example, as well as other musicians like Radiohead. It has just never been applied to a group of albums like this, much less game albums.<p>6. $1 is the minimum due to bandwidth costs and PayPal fees.<p>7. Most of the albums here are soundtracks to independent video games. They were produced by independent musicians not affiliated with any label. That's what we mean by game albums or game soundtracks. Some of the games are quite popular (Minecraft, Super Meat Boy) while others are a bit more obscure (Return All Robots!) As for whether you would want them and how to get a sample, you can listen to all the music streaming in full by clicking on the album of your choice and then previewing some tracks. Thus, you can decide for yourself if you're interested in at least some of the music.<p>8. There is no particular license on these. You can listen to them, copy them, send tracks to your friends (though ideally, we would prefer if they got copies too) etc. If you want to use a track from any given album for some kind of commercial project you would of course want to talk to the artist involved with that particular album. Most of us would be cool with any kind of non-commercial usage.<p>9. As I mentioned, most of the albums consist of music used in various games. So for example, ""Minecraft: Volume Alpha"" is music from the game Minecraft. A few of them, like ""Imposter Nostalgia"" and ""Antigravity"" are simply original albums that are stylistically similar to electronic video game music. In terms of the technology used to create them, it varies greatly depending on the artist. Most of us have personal websites which you can find on the individual album pages, where we describe who we are and what tools we use.<p>10. Every artist involved has some form of social media presence such as Twitter or Facebook, and has posted about this bundle to their friends, fans and followers. Thus you can verify by viewing these official accounts and their posts endorsing the sale. So, the sale is completely legitimate.",1322334797

3280431,comment,3279878,3280296,5,0,quanticle,,,"The author is referring to the fact that the taskbar/dock in Unity doesn't offer the same affordances as the old Gnome2 taskbar. For example, in Ubuntu 11.04, there was no way to open a new terminal from the dock. You had to click on the terminal icon, then click File->New Terminal. As someone who routinely opens a number of terminals for various tasks, that one regression was a source of significant slowdowns.<p>In addition, Unity is slow on any system that doesn't have a separate graphics card or the latest generation of integrated graphics. There doesn't appear to be a way to turn off the graphical effects to speed it up. Combine that with the usability regressions, and Unity was a definite no-go for me.<p>That's not to say that I ""hate"" Unity or will never use it as my desktop environment. I think Unity has a lot of potential. Unfortunately, like all too much software out there, it was released before it had been fully finished. I look forward to trying Unity again when the next Ubuntu LTS (12.04, I believe) is released. Hopefully it'll be far more usable and ""finished"" by then.",1322334296

1883265,comment,1882469,1882475,0,0,azim,,,"It seems to me like the problems you're having, like intellisense not working correctly and the debugger being broken, are problems with the SDK tools and not with Eclipse itself. Writing your own tools I fear you will run in to many of the same problems. While I feel that you're right in saying developing Windows C++ apps under VS is a superior experience as compared to developing Linux C++ apps under Eclipse, Visual Studio cross-target development kits I've used in the past tended to be sub-par compared to either. Many degenerate in to rather dumb text editors with project management. From a technical standpoint, integrating with intellisense and the graphical debugger is much more difficult under Visual Studio. Either way, good luck and keep us posted!",1289239043

My roommate is a hardware engineer on the iPad team, and he won't even confirm that there will be another iPad. He takes extra precautions when working at home - he won't take work calls if I'm in the room, and he set up the furniture in his room in an awkward fashion solely so that his computer monitor didn't face towards the door.<p>Several times I've brought friends or family down to Cupertino. He lets us inside to walk around the inner campus and eat at Caffe Macs, but that's truly all there is to see. Certainly we can't enter any other buildings on Infinite Loop.<p>One thing this article doesn't mention is work-life balance. We live in SF, and my roommate has a 90-minute commute (each way) on the Apple shuttle, and he usually works 12 hours on top of that. He's out by 8am and doesn't usually return until 11pm. He tells me this is a common topic of discussion at Caffe Macs - the balance between working on groundbreaking technology and, quite simply, having zero personal time during the week (and often on the weekends).<p>He can be called to go to China with no more than a few days' notice, and the duration of his stay there is never known ahead of time. He often estimates 7-10 days but it frequently ends up being closer to 2, even 3 weeks. Apple covers all of his expenses, of course, but he doesn't much care for Shenzhen.<p>He really likes working at Apple, but I think he recognizes that it's not a sustainable job for him for more than 3 or 4 years.",1289238678

1883239,comment,1882516,1883119,0,0,mechanical_fish,,,"Apple's products don't seem like good counterexamples to me.<p>Apple <i>is</i> promoting the iPad as a different kind of iPod Touch. The thing sits right next to the Touch in stores and on web pages. It runs all the same software. It even <i>looks</i> like a giant iPhone. The ""magical"" and ""revolutionary"" adjectives are different, but differentiation is an essential part of the strategy: You can't just <i>clone</i> the product with an existing market, you have to <i>improve</i> upon it somehow.<p>On the one hand, promoting the iPod as a ""better MP3 player"" would have been a losing strategy because ""MP3 players"" were not an existing market worth entering. The number of people using MP3 players ten years ago was tiny compared to the number of music buyers. And on the other hand, iPods were aimed pretty directly at the market for existing portable music players, which was much larger. The slogan was ""a thousand songs in your pocket"", and the iconic image was a pair of white headphones snaking out of that pocket. I don't think people missed the fact that the iPod was a Walkman, only better. Apple could, instead, have played up the fact that the iPod was a tiny computer that played games, or a tiny portable hard drive that let you tote documents around, but in fact these aspects were very muted, because they distracted from the story that the iPod was a super-Walkman.<p>Apple's actually really good at playing the existing-market-only-different game. The iPod was a different kind of Walkman; the iMac was a different kind of Windows PC; the iPhone was a kind of phone <i>and</i> a kind of iPod; the iPod Touch was a kind of iPhone and a kind of iPod; the iPad is a kind of iPod Touch. It seems evident that Apple could have launched the iPad ten years ago as a new product, and failed. In fact, that seems evident because it <i>actually happened</i>: The Newton came out, it was a new kind of product at the time, and it died horribly. So instead of repeating that mistake, Apple bootstrapped the iPad market, one tweak of an existing market at a time.<p>The biggest ""failure"" (or, in Apple terms, ""hobby"") in the current Apple product line is the Apple TV, and a big reason it's failed so far is that nobody knows what kind of thing it is. (It isn't even ""a kind of TiVo"", for all the good that would do.)",1289238614

I'm currently in CakePHP, so I'm looking at it's security component.  It has a security level that you set in your app, to low, med, high.  If it's set to high, the session is regenerated with each request, meaning that the session hijacking probably won't work.<p>However, it gets complicated when you look at the following situation:
user authenticates, gets session id of 1234.
attacker steals cookie, now has session id 1234.
----
next request comes in, session is regenerated by the server.  Next request comes in with session id of 1234 (invalid).  Server recognizes this and invalidates all sessions for that user id (1234 and the new one).  Have to invalidate all of them, because you don't know which is the valid browser request.<p>That's all well and good.  But it will also log out any other browser that I had logged in.  In effect, it will annoy your users and greatly degrade the usefulness of the ""remember me"" cookie.<p>Is it worth it for your site?  Tough to tell.  But it will prevent your users from staying logged in across multiple browsers, which is something to take into account.  Probably worth it for protecting my bank account (if they didn't use SSL and many other security measures).  Probably not worth it for protecting my Pandora mixes.",1289236699

You can see why ""This researcher has correctly predicted the last two cycles"" can easily be attributed to luck. Given that a research career spans at most 4 such cycles, it's hard to demonstrate one's ability.<p>There's a few respected solar scientists who have written papers to the effect that such forecasting is way beyond our capabilities (there's hints of chaotic behavior in the sun).

2856148,comment,2855948,2855948,2,0,jamesbrewer,,,"I'll share something with you that I've only recently come to understand: Unless you're really interested in both subjects then double majors aren't worth the time and sweat you put into them. The fact is that the double major MIGHT give you a slight advantage when it comes to getting an interview, but after you have a year or two of experience under your belt your double major won't matter much at all. Software companies want people who can get things done, not people who can take more technical courses than any human should.<p>I was considering a double major in Applied Math and Computer Science but I've recently decided to go a similar, but different route. Instead of taking all of the Applied Math courses that I don't foresee myself using, like Partial Differential Equations and Numerical Methods for Differential Equations, I will be picking up a few math courses that I actually WANT to take, like Probability Theory and Stochastic Processes.<p>Take courses you want to take. Take courses that will help you in the long run. If you don't get a double major, then so what? Just go build something awesome and you'll get a job no problem.",1312703961

The protests are usually against this invasion and consist of calls to get the Northern Territories of Japan returned.<p>Also, there are angry tantrums and shouting, but there are no throwing of empty bottles at the walls of the embassy because the riot police do quite an impressive job not letting any of the protestors through. It's a bit of a charade and an annoyance when you're trying to conduct business in the area, but the reality is different from the story you're sharing.",1312703960

I can guarantee it. I wouldn't recommend spending a bunch of money on a single monitor though. Buy two ~22"" monitors off of NewEgg. It won't feel the same as a 27"" monitor, but you'll have considerably more space, pay at least half the price, and have some explicit compartmentalization going. The downside is that it's not all the same monitor, and you need hte deskspace. As well as having to buy a cable for having multiple external monitors with a Macbook Pro.<p>I say give it a try, and return it if isn't as comfortable as you want it to be. You'll still be able to get your money back (assuming you return the stuff in the same condition you bought it), and you can go and try the 27"" monitor too.",1312703802

Let's not forget how stagnant desktop computing became in the years of the Microsoft monopoly.</i><p>I agree that that monopolistic era was especially pernicious. It wasn't just that Microsoft controlled a huge share of the desktop market; it was that this made them a <i>de facto</i> gatekeeper with regard to technology before the Web. Also, there were a lot of startups that couldn't get fair acquisition prices because there was only one buyer. The only good thing that comes out of monopolies is R&D (e.g. Bell Labs)... but I'd rather see R&D propelled by employee demands for autonomy (when there's lots of competition for talent) than by executive largess within a monopoly. One of the most exciting things to come out of Microsoft's research department is F#, and that emerged after the monopoly era was over.<p>Apple and Google both make excellent products, with completely different approaches but an end result that's great for users. Competition is good for products and also good for employees within companies (competition for talent).",1312703778

This includes anger tantrums, shouting, throwing empty bottles into the wall and some such.<p>Here's the fun part. The embassy is Russian.<p>Apparently the logic behind their anger is that it was Soviet Union who caused the bombings by silently agreeing to it when they had a chance to stop them.

Regardless of how talented he may be, he was put in an almost impossible situation as CEO of Sun--too much damage had already been done.<p>Linus Torvalds: First, a personal disclosure--I am a huge Torvalds fanboy, and would certainly have disagreed with CNN on this one. That said, you could now make a good case that CNN got this one right. In the last five years, Linus really hasn't done anything big from a business perspective. Absolutely he has been busy creating software that people use and care about (Git and continuing Linux development). However, none of has recent activity has had a major economic impact. (Can you name an industry that's been disrupted by Git?) Even the major things that Linux has done in the last five years (Android, for example) happened without being driven by Linus.

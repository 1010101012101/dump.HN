Kubrik edited out a short bit in the beginning explaining the theory behind it along with other discussion of alien life.<p>I saw a talk from Hod Lipson who mentioned that NASA estimated that the machinery needed to rebuild civilization could fit in a 100-ton cargo hold. That is pretty amazing. With the right resources, send one to Mars, let robots build some radiation shields, and get crackin.",1199728667

95682,comment,95521,95521,0,0,ivankirigin,,,"I read a statistic from around 2002 that China consumed slightly more coal than the US, while polluting twice as much and generating half as much electricity.<p>You needn't be an environmentalist to be concerned with such numbers. You also don't have to be an optimist to expect this to get better.<p>More wealth will mean more efficiency and less pollution. More wealth dispersed throughout the population will mean greater demand by people to take action against already horrible air pollution, and other damage.<p>But the pattern is familiar, and we only point out China because of its size. Production will move to poorer countries, and they will outsource their pollution generation just as we have.",1199728365

The fact is that it takes an order of magnitude more land to produce the same output.<p>Forget cars, TVs, and McMansions.

Although yes, some logos are <i>hideous</i>, childish, so unprofessional (del.icio.us, reddit, google, etc.)<p>Liked the web standards part a lot. Somehow it reminds the situation with programming languages - no good software is written in Java - another committee-driven cra... sorry, product.<p>However, these 7 habits are not sufficient, not even necessary conditions for success.

95675,comment,95663,95673,0,0,mrtron,,,"I am wondering why X mongrels are commonly used with Rails, is it just how mongrel is designed and dispatched that you need to establish X amount and it does not change with the load?<p>Being completely ignorant of mongrel, what is the benefit of having 7 mongrels running instead of 1?  Does it not just do the job of dispatching the child processes to handle requests, so one would handle things just as effectively?
I suppose what I am asking is, with one box why would you have more than one dispatcher?",1199727764

(this number was already set to seven before the digging, and didn't have to be increased)<p>Having to pick arbitrary numbers beforehand is a bad way of scaling.  Apache with fcgid launches new processes as they're needed.  It may not scale due to other problems, but ""pick a number and pray"" strikes me as a dubious idea.",1199727475

95670,comment,95656,95656,0,0,pchristensen,,,"Seth Godin pointed to a study from the AOL Global Advertising Strategy about who actually clicks on ads:<p>'Advertising is the bread and butter of the web, yet most of my friends claim that they never click on ads, typically using a peacock tone that signals their pride in being ad-averse. The geekier amongst them go out of their way to run Mozilla scripts to scrape ads away, bemoaning the presence of consumer culture. Yet, companies increasingly rely on ad revenue to turn a profit'<p>'Who are these ""heavy clickers""? They are predominantly female, indexing at a rate almost double the male population. They are older. They are predominantly Midwesterners, with some concentrations in Mid-Atlantic States and in New England. What kinds of content do they like to view when they are on the Web? Not surprisingly, they look at sweepstakes far more than any other kind of content. Yes, these are the same people that tend to open direct mail and love to talk to telemarketers.'<p><a href=""http://sethgodin.typepad.com/seths_blog/2007/12/your-ads-are-no.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://sethgodin.typepad.com/seths_blog/2007/12/your-ads-are...</a><p><a href=""http://www.zephoria.org/thoughts/archives/2007/12/03/who_clicks_on_a.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.zephoria.org/thoughts/archives/2007/12/03/who_cli...</a>",1199727282

95665,comment,95656,95656,0,0,PStamatiou,,,"I'd love to know the answer to this one. I've always sucked at monetizing and I get 300k pviews/month. I've attempted joining the larger tech blog ad networks but they pretty much won't talk to you until you hit 1M pviews/month. I'm not one for ugly advertising like adsense - just a personal thing, so I've started running those 125x125 ad blocks and various sponsorship things. They're hard to sell but if you can find the right companies and get decent traffic you can do alright. I sold my last 125x125 for $800 for a month.",1199726789
95664,comment,95656,95656,0,0,davidw,,,"I'm thinking of de-monetizing mine, as it just doesn't make much money (adsense), and a cleaner look might be nice.  To actually make money, you have to write a lot about writing on your blog, or have massive amounts of users, or write about something that a lot of people click on ads about.  Meaning that tech-savvy people, who are the best at ignoring ads, are a terrible audience.",1199726736

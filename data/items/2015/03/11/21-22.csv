9187689,comment,9185732,9187560,0,0,Mz,,,"<i>we may respect someone&#x27;s decisions, but that doesn&#x27;t mean we&#x27;re going to put financing behind them.</i><p>Sigh.<p>I am not sure if we are on the same page here with what we are trying to communicate. In some sense, you have to put money behind it in order to respect it, but perhaps not in any manner that you are meaning by that comment.<p>The current state of the U.S. housing situation grows out of the history of the past many decades, going back to at least WWII. During WWII, men went off the war and women got factory jobs, consumer items were rationed and car factories got converted to making military vehicles. You had a lot of de facto two income households with no kids and no means to have a child due to the man being on a different continent from the woman. During WWII, savings rates were as high as 50% during some years, just because there was no means to spend it all. Luxury items simply weren&#x27;t available and people in the U.S. were being encouraged to grow Victory Gardens so that food grown on farms could be used to supply the military overseas.<p>The men came back home after WWII and they were entitled to VA benefits, including help buying a home. Practically overnight, the federal government put together the financial infrastructure to help large numbers of returning soldiers buy a house. There weren&#x27;t enough houses to go around, in part because WWII was preceded by The Great Depression. So America also had to create the housing infrastructure overnight. This resulted in Levittowns going up all over the place, introducing suburbs to the nation.<p>At that point in time, the average new home was less than 1200 square feet, two bedrooms, one bath and housed a family with two adults and two to three children. By 2000, the average new house was over 2000 square feet and housed a family with two adults and only one child. We have diversified demographically and we now have a lot more elderly retired couples with no kids at home, single parents, and other non-nuclear families while at the same time having a lot fewer housing alternatives in real terms. During The Great Depression, things like SRO&#x27;s and boarding houses were a lot more common. These days, if you are a single young person with not much of a paycheck, in most parts of the U.S., you wind up renting an apartment designed for a nuclear family and sharing it with roommates because there basically are no other viable alternatives.<p>This is all rooted in housing policy, which is very tied up in things like tax breaks and financing instruments. If you do not change policy in a way that makes money/financing instruments more accessible to people currently getting ugly labels because of their low income or lack of housing or what not -- because, in short, they fail to be what America wants to believe is some picture of success, as if that were context-neutral, which it very much is not -- then, no, you aren&#x27;t ACTUALLY respecting people who are currently being screwed over royally by our current system.<p>Fixing it doesn&#x27;t mean more government dole programs that control the lives of the recipients. It means altering national policy such that we genuinely need less of that because market solutions are more available to more people. Right now, housing policy and financing instruments tie the hands of a lot of people.<p>Anyway, I have work to do. I no longer get food stamps and I kind of would like to eat every day this month. So I need to excuse myself from further participating here, at least until I get some paid writing done.<p>Thank you.",1426111167

You can&#x27;t really do deep analytics/machine learning as RethinkDB wasn&#x27;t designed for that, but if you want to store a lot of data, and then run lightweight aggregation or map-reduce queries on that data, Rethink turns out to be a really good product for it.<p>One issue I see with this path is that if your queries ever get a lot more complex, you&#x27;d have to migrate off of RethinkDB onto Hadoop (which is a pain). I think that if you know for certain you just want lightweight querying capabilities RethinkDB can be really wonderful, but if there is a good chance you might need something deeper, it might be worth the effort to set up Hadoop early on.",1426111121

In 1999, floppy disk use was far more prevalent than the need for multiple USB ports is now. For your described use case, you&#x27;ll just plug your Macbook into a USB3 hub or dongle with HDMI (I don&#x27;t think this machine has enough graphics power for multiple external screens). You will actually have fewer cables to manage.<p>And it actually would hurt the Macbook to include more ports. The current port is above the keyboard, likely because it can&#x27;t fit under the keyboard. Adding more ports would mean increasing one of the dimensions. Given the versatility of the USB3C port, I think it&#x27;s the best possible tradeoff.

(Not that they don&#x27;t exist, but even if you made it your life goal to obtain one of these jobs you probably still shouldn&#x27;t count on it.) $100K/year for a developer is very realistic, but keep an eye on the cost-of-living; even in the US that can be anything from upper-middle class lifestyle for an individual to &quot;barely getting by&quot; for a family.<p>I live in the Midwest and have what in the US would be a sanely priced house that bears some resemblance to its cost-of-construction. I have done business trips to Silicon Valley to developers who are making only modestly more than me, if not the same as me, who are living in houses worth 5 times as much on paper (and in their mortgage payments), and they&#x27;ll be in there putting in top-of-the-line granite countertops or something that I wouldn&#x27;t dream of putting in. My theory is that their house is just <i>so gosh darned</i> expensive that the idea of dropping $2K on a new laptop or getting The Very Best Countertops (TM) seems like a drop in the bucket compared to the debt they&#x27;re already carrying anyhow. While I could certainly afford a $2K laptop, it&#x27;s certainly enough to make me think twice, thrice, and a fourth time before I bought it (and I tend to come in more in the $1K price range when I do, since I run Linux and not Mac.

The trade-up to SSD/High-res and the curiosity of the &#x27;new shiny laptop from Google&#x27; sold me.<p>In terms of upgrading to one in 2015, Google are claiming 12 hour battery life and The Verge said it got 14 hours in their testing - which is more than enough for me. I personally just don&#x27;t like OSX, although I&#x27;d be happy installing linux on a MBP. ChromeOS is fine for a few quick browser tasks (Amazon, Booking Flights, etc), but it&#x27;s not worth keeping around really. So at that point it just boils down to personal preference on the hardware, and price. The build-quality of the keyboard and touchpad on the pixel are on-par with the high quality of the MBP, and they&#x27;ve made the hinge more solid this time around, so with an i7 processor and 16GBs of RAM at $1300 I&#x27;m pretty happy! The 64GB SSD is definitely a major buzzkill, but considering I won&#x27;t be using this laptop for gaming, and I stream all of my music/tv/movies, I don&#x27;t actually need a whole pile of local storage. With my current pixel&#x27;s 64GB I never ran into any issues - the only thing that I feel is a threat to my diskspace is VM images for virtualbox, which I luckily don&#x27;t have to use much anymore as I now have remote access to windows servers should I need them. The touchscreen (for me) is pointless, I&#x27;d much rather have a 128GB/256GB SSD, but it&#x27;s not the end of the world.",1426110576

I&#x27;ve thought for some time that the primary virtues of NNTP were that it was text-based and client-centric.<p>You don&#x27;t need a whole lot of stuff in a news article. Text, basic formatting, images, references, maybe a table or chart. Just because you can make elaborate interactive graphics doesn&#x27;t mean that you should, most of the time. HTML is way overpowered for news and (more to the point) it makes it too easy for publishers to distribute crap to downstream users like Betty.<p>This brings me to the other side of the equation; the client. I do not just want an embedded browser. I&#x27;ve grown to hate the way that publishers, and their minions, the designers (^_^) have slapped CSS all over everything in order to brand every aspect of the web experience. I actually have preferences of my own about fonts, layout and so on, and I really miss being able to configure client software to display things the way I liked to look at them rather than the way some Jolt-chugging framework addict with a me-too manager wants to show it to me.<p>There are huge untapped opportunities in news delivery, of the sort I&#x27;d be willing to pay for. Why is there no way, for example, to pull up a globe that shows me where the hottest news stories are right now, or to use the same mapping layer for all geographic data contained in news stories, or build and share correlates, or set rules  for source integrity to filter the obvious content farms that keep cropping up in my Google news feed, and so on?<p>News is ever-changing, but it&#x27;s also consistent enough in lots of ways that it should super-enhanced by machine learning by now: the action and outcomes of individual sporting fixtures is highly unpredictable, but the context and seasonal progress of sporting fixtures is nearly invariant. Likewise, I don&#x27;t know which country in the world will supply next week&#x27;s most consequential events, but I do know that the list of countries and their associated geographic features vary very little over time. All stories involving weather take place in the context of seasonal variations over annual and decadal timeframes; by extension so do a vast number of economic news stories that involve commodities, and monthly and annual cycles are inherent to all sorts of economic and commercial activity. For a good many topics, there are only a few interesting facts worth parsing out of a 500-word story; much of the content is just contextual boilerplate. And yet when I go to Google Finance all I get is this mess of news headlines, uncorrelated data series, and market weathervanes. There is a great set of tools in Google Trendsbut there doesn&#x27;t seem to be any systematic undertaking to integrate them with the feed of news.<p>My best guess is that most people are simply not interested enough in news to see a viable subscription-based model, or even an ad-based one based on carefully managed ads (like Google search results rather than the hideous eye candy that pollutes most news websites).

People could use bluetooth headphones with it if they really couldn&#x27;t find some other place for the headphone jack, but I&#x27;m sure they could have squeezed it in if they tried hard enough.

Otherwise the example they&#x27;re setting will either influence everyone, or they&#x27;ll be written off and now whoever hired them is going to inherit that distrust of competence.<p>Regarding management being an inherent talent, it&#x27;s absolutely not. But a new executive hire is not the way to develop that talent--that job is for people who&#x27;ve already developed it. Mentor first, then promote, if you&#x27;re shepherding someone from within.<p>And now, not ignoring cronyism and other poor reasons to hire someone, I think that whole &quot;why did you hire them in the first place&quot; is exactly what he&#x27;s getting at. Don&#x27;t hire (or promote) someone because you <i>like</i> them, assuming you can make them something they aren&#x27;t today.<p>That&#x27;s pretty much always true, strictly from a business perspective, but it&#x27;s crucial as you go up the ladder.

I think the last option, a basic living allowance, is something we, as a country, are going to have to come to terms with&quot;<p>The issue with this is that once you start giving a basic living allowance, more and more people will continue to rely on it over time and the system will eventually collapse.<p>&quot;I prefer a minimum living stipend for a few reasons: It doesn&#x27;t treat the poor like they are too stupid or too criminal to manage their own lives and their own money.&quot;<p>It&#x27;s not their money, it&#x27;s money given to them by the tax payers..and I don&#x27;t agree with you reasoning.  If you are getting free money from the government, it means you can&#x27;t manage your own life.  I don&#x27;t really see how this will change the view on the disadvantaged.<p>&quot;It allows people the ability to move to more fulfilling (and more lucrative) employment by providing time for training.&quot;<p>I don&#x27;t think this would increase anyone&#x27;s time for training.  I know lots of people that are unemployed (and get unemployment).  You would think with all of that extra free time, they could finish more projects, learn new skills, or even get training.  Unless they are forced, most just think of it as free money and don&#x27;t appreciate it as much as they would if they earned it themselves.  It&#x27;s the same reason most people can&#x27;t run a business and why most lottery winners end up losing it all within 5 years.<p>&quot;It protects kids without trying to transition parenting responsibility to the state. In general, it keeps the state out of people&#x27;s lives, increasing their dignity.&quot;<p>It doesn&#x27;t really keep the state out of your life.  It will create entire generations dependent on it.  In fact, they will be directly controlling your life since many will start relying on that money to live.<p>&quot;Yes, there will still be homeless people. There will be people who squander the money. But there will be many who take advantage of it and build a better life for themselves and all of their posterity. And I prefer to bet on the general desire of people to better themselves.&quot;<p>My issue still is that these costs will only increase over time.  The middle class worker will see tax increases and there will be no incentive to get a minimum wage job, because you can just get it from the government.  This will also have the added side effect of inflation.<p>The single worst thing you can do for someone disadvantaged is to give them a reason to stay exactly where they are in life (and no incentive to succeed at something more).

In Ohio, because of sufficient rainfall, only 1% of the corn is irrigated while in Nebraska 72% of the crop is irrigated. It takes 19 gallons of water to produce a bushel of corn in Region 5, 38 gallons in Region 6, and 865 gallons in Region 7. The Baker Institute estimates that producing the corn to meet the ethanol mandate for 2015 will require 2.9 trillion gallons of water.<p>Most of this irrigation water is drawn from groundwater aquifers in a region that is already water stressed. Conflicts over water allotments have occurred in Kansas and Nebraska, and the Ogallala Aquifer, which lies under the Great Plains and supplies 30% of the nation’s groundwater for irrigation, is in danger of running dry.<p>Growing corn also requires a great deal of fertilizer, and extensive use of nitrogen fertilizer and pesticides is having severe impacts on water quality now. Fertilizer laden runoff into streams in the Midwest makes its way to the Mississippi River, and eventually contributes to the eutrophication (when algae bloom, then die, depleting the area of oxygen and suffocating plants and animals) in the Gulf of Mexico. In 2010, this dead zone in the Gulf of Mexico was estimated to be almost 8000 square miles and it continues to grow. 2.39 million additional tons of nitrogen fertilizer will be needed to meet the 2015 mandate.<p>Easily erodible and less productive land set aside by the conservation reserve program, that paid farmers to retire inferior land, is now being pressed back into service due to the lure of high corn prices. This land will likely need additional fertilizer and irrigation to be productive, which will result in more polluted runoff and water consumption.<p>Although biofuels are promoted because they are said to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, some scientists argue that when the life cycle of ethanol production is compared to that of conventional gasoline, there may be no reduction in greenhouse gas emissions at all. More corn is being planted on more land fertilized with nitrogen, resulting in additional air and water pollution from nitrous oxide, a chemical 300 times more potent than carbon dioxide as a greenhouse gas.<p>Processing corn to make ethanol requires substantial amounts of water for the grinding, liquefaction, fermentation, separation and drying procedures. Over the last ten years, however, some of the nation’s 200 biorefineries have been able to reduce water use from 6.8 gallons of water per gallon of ethanol to 3 gallons by boosting the efficiency of their equipment. South Dakota based Poet,the world’s largest ethanol producer is aiming to cut its overall water intake by 22% by 2014, and use only 2.33 gallons of water per gallon of ethanol produced. This would reduce its annual water use by 1 billion gallons.&quot;<p><a href=""http://blogs.ei.columbia.edu/2011/03/21/ethanol%E2%80%99s-impacts-on-our-water-resources/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blogs.ei.columbia.edu/2011/03/21/ethanol%E2%80%99s-im...</a>",1426107902

I love being well versed in something and offering suggestions to people, but I have always been more of a taker when it comes to music. Normally I&#x27;m ready with a book/movie/tv/game/whatever recommendation, but I&#x27;ve never been connected to the music world the same way.<p>It could also be a sibling thing, as 2 of my younger brothers are very much on the cutting edge of new acts (following tiny blogs, watching new soundcloud accounts, etc.), and I feel like I end up mostly relying on hearing new things through them. There&#x27;s even a clear delineation in my musical tastes in the early 2000s when my siblings began finding music and I shifted away from relying on my parents&#x27; stuff to theirs. It&#x27;s just something I think about when I&#x27;m strolling through spotify playlists most days.",1426107703

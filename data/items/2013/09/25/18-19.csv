One of my problems with LastPass is that the whole system is bootstrapped over HTTPS, which is has some insecurities.  Essentially, LastPass sends your browser JavaScript via HTTPS which is then used to encrypt all your passwords using AES and send them over the net.  The problem is that the original JavaScript payload could be compromised by third parties that have access to the root CA.  I realize that revelations about HTTPS insecurity are new and limited to nation-state attacks, but we&#x27;re talking about all your passwords, here.<p>Putting HTTPS insecurity aside, we really shouldn&#x27;t be implementing crypto in JavaScript.<p><a href=""http://www.matasano.com/articles/javascript-cryptography/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.matasano.com/articles/javascript-cryptography/</a><p>KeePass is both native and open-source, so it avoids many of the problems that LastPass presents, IMHO.

Signedness and lenient overflow promote laziness. Array indexes don&#x27;t make sense as signed, yet most people prefer to iterate arrays with a signed type, e.g most commonly:<p><pre><code>  for (int i = 0; i < 10; ++i) buf[i] = 0;\n</code></pre>\nFar too many people rely on signed integer overflow working as you expect the underlying machine to handle it - but that&#x27;s not what the C spec says and not how a compiler handles it either.<p>There are countless security issues I&#x27;ve had to fix related to signed types in what is supposed to be secure code. These would not have occurred if the author was forced to use an unsigned type, and had to consider the extreme limits of the values it can take on.

6446309,comment,6445096,6445096,41,0,apu,,,"The sample images are of two types: images which are mostly of the subject (cat or dog), and images which have a cat or dog in them, but are not necessarily focused on them.<p>In computer vision, these two types of images are traditionally handled separately. First, a detector for a class (like &quot;dog&quot; or &quot;cat&quot;) is run across the image at all locations and multiple scales to find <i>where</i> the things are. Once you have the locations, then an image classification algorithm is run for each detection window to either confirm it, or to give you more information about the object.<p>The latter often takes the form of giving more fine-grained category information, such as what species of dog/cat it is. Both leafsnap [1] and dogsnap [2] take the form of this type of program; i.e., they both assume that you&#x27;ve captured a single subject, roughly centered in the photo window, and that you already know that it&#x27;s a plant/dog.<p>Sometimes you don&#x27;t have to run a detector even if the object is not the focus of the image, if the context/setting can narrow down the answer for you. For example, if you were deciding between dogs and airplanes, it would be pretty unlikely to see a dog on a runway or a plane in a living room, so just by classifying the entire image, you can do reasonably well. That&#x27;s not the case here, as dogs and cats will, for the most part, appear in pretty similar environments.<p>So if I were attacking this problem, I&#x27;d first see how many images were of the non-focused type. If not many, I&#x27;d basically ignore them and focus on building a classification system. Note also that if you&#x27;re constrained to make a hard choice between only two classes, that&#x27;s a much easier problem than a more open-ended &quot;what is this?&quot;<p>As many have pointed out, deep learning approaches seem to be the current state of the art on classification tasks such as these. But deep learning requires a lot of training data to be effective. A procedure I&#x27;ve been hearing many people use to great success is to use the Imagenet [3] hierarchy and images to train a deep learning classifier (i.e., as if you were going to compete in the Imagenet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge [4]). Then use the trained network, chop off the last stage (which makes the final prediction), and replace it with an SVM trained on your specific training data. In this way, you&#x27;d be using the network only as a feature extractor.<p>I&#x27;m happy to try and answer other questions.<p>[1] <a href=""http://leafsnap.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://leafsnap.com</a> or see my project page for more details on how it works: <a href=""http://homes.cs.washington.edu/~neeraj/projects/leafsnap/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://homes.cs.washington.edu/~neeraj/projects/leafsnap/</a><p>[2] <a href=""https://itunes.apple.com/app/dogsnap/id532468586?mt=8"" rel=""nofollow"">https://itunes.apple.com/app/dogsnap/id532468586?mt=8</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://www.image-net.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.image-net.org/</a><p>[4] <a href=""http://www.image-net.org/challenges/LSVRC/2013/index"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.image-net.org/challenges/LSVRC/2013/index</a>",1380133232

For example, a Pipistrel Sinus will set you back about $86,000:<p><a href=""http://www.aviationbull.com/sinus"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.aviationbull.com/sinus</a><p>Compared to the Terrafugia, you can buy that, plus two $30,000 cars, and still have $133,000 left over to rent more cars. Or, say, buy a house. The Sinus also carries more weight, flies faster, burns less fuel, has a better range, and requires <i>vastly</i> less runway.<p>It&#x27;s also probably substantially safer in the event of an engine failure. I don&#x27;t see a glide ratio listed for the Transition, but just from looking at its relatively large frontal area, low-aspect-ratio wings, and gigantic road-sized front wheels exposed to the air with naked struts, I&#x27;d guess it&#x27;s probably in the Cessna range of 10 or under. The Sinus has a glide ratio of 27, meaning you can get quite far to an airport if the engine quits. It&#x27;s actually a decently performing glider in addition to a regular airplane.<p>If you expand the search to used aircraft, you can get quite cheap.

I won&#x27;t spoil the story here. Unluckily it&#x27;s rather difficult to get to run properly on modern computers. :-(<p>- Dreamfall: The Longest Journey<p>The sequel to The Longest Journey. I didn&#x27;t like it so much, mainly because of the action elements. I&#x27;d like to mention that in November 2014 the sequel to Dreamfall called &quot;Dreamfall Chapters&quot; is to be released. This game was funded by a Kickstarter. The developers promised to drop the action elements.<p>Games by Future Games (from Czechia; now bankrupt)<p>- Black Mirror: Der dunkle Spiegel der Seele (this is the name under which it was published in Germany)<p>A rather serious, dark adventure. In Germany two sequels were published, about which I can&#x27;t say anything, since I didn&#x27;t play them.<p>- Nibiru: Der Bote der Gtter (this is the name under which it was published in Germany)<p>Haven&#x27;t played it, but it has its fans.<p>The next game that Future Games developed (Reprobates: Insel der Verdammten (for this game I also only know its German name)) was rather bad. I really don&#x27;t recommend it (although the story wasn&#x27;t as black as it is painted in many reviews).<p>Games by Pndulo Studios (from Spain)<p>- Runaway: A Road Adventure<p>This is probably the adventure game which brought back the renaissance of adventure games. This game is considered as rather hard (small, difficult to find hotspots) and even lead to the concept formation of &quot;Runaway Syndrome&quot; (meaning that you often have to return to &quot;containers&quot; to look whether you find an item in it, for which now a use could be found). Nevertheless: I consider it as a pretty good serious (despite its comic graphics) adventure.<p>This game has two sequels<p>- Runaway 2  The Dream of the Turtle<p>Here the developers tried to make the game more funny and bright - which fans didn&#x27;t like (it&#x27;s still a good game). It is ending in a steep cliffhanger.<p>- Runaway: A Twist of Fate<p>In this game the trilogy ends. More dark and serious as the first part. If you play the game you&#x27;ll notice that the developers wanted to make part 2 &quot;forgotten&quot; since the cliffhanger at the end of &quot;Runaway 2&quot; is resolved completely differently than you would have expected.<p>Games by House of Tales (from Germany)<p>- The Moment of Silence<p>A science fiction adventure that poses lots of questions about surveillance (which is especially interesting if you compare these to the leaks of Snowden).<p>- Overclocked: A History of Violence (English title)<p>A dark story about a former American military psychiatrist who has to treat five amnesic teens suddenly appearing with guns. For this he has to go deep into their subject minds. I highly recommend it.<p>Games by Deck 13 (from Germany)<p>- The Ankh Trilogy consisting of Ankh, Ankh: Heart of Osiris (Ankh: Herz des Osiris), Ankh: Battle of the Gods (Ankh: Kampf der Gtter)<p>I only played the first two parts of it. The best way to describe these adventure games is: what Monkey Island is to pirate games are the Ankh games to the ancient egypt. The first part is good, but the second one is IMHO even much better.7<p>Games by Microds (from France)<p>- Syberia & Syberia II<p>A melodrama about a female lawyer who must find the secret heir of an automaton factory who was a genius inventor.",1380132312

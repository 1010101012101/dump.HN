I hate to be one of those fans who always claims ""the old stuff was better,"" but Stephenson's style of expounding on cool ideas via novels works much better for shorter books like ""Snow Crash.""  It often seems like Stephenson considers character, setting, and plot to be the unfortunate necessities of writing a novel.  When reading ""Anathem,"" ""Quicksilver,"" and to a lesser extent ""Cryptonomicon,"" I felt like Stephenson wasn't really interested in writing the book -- what he really wanted to do was sit down and have a dorm room-style brainstorming session where he and the reader go back and forth about the uses of cryptography, what if the Roman Catholic Church were based on math and science rather than religion, or how Newtonian physics and calculus are really the fundamental principles defining the modern era.<p>Somehow, ""Snow Crash"" was quick and funny enough that it didn't get bogged down by Sumerian mythology, linguistics, the nature of post-governmental society, etc.  No single concept required elaborate exposition; Stephenson was able lay out the world of the novel without devoting 200 pages to plot-less description.  If ""Snow Crash"" is close in spirit to ""Neuromancer,"" ""Anathem"" is way out near ""Atlas Shrugged.""",1227365965

372958,comment,372573,372573,0,0,Allocator2008,,,"Paraphrasing Rand, I think I would tell my younger self: Do not recognize anyone's right to one minute of your life, nor to any part of your energy, nor to any creation of yours, no matter how large their number nor how great their need.<p>Personally, I think I spent too much time in a futile effort to please parents and relatives and so forth. Later in life, I find that is not only a futile effort, it can also make one completely miserable, since one is not being one's truest self, but is acting as one perceives others want them to act or be. Reading Rand, I find that mistake is a common but grave mistake, underlying societal decay in much of history, namely, the mistake of living for others instead of oneself. So yeah, that would basically be it. If I could reach back a decade, and tell a copy of myself in a Everett-Wheeler parallel universe one thing, that would be it, the above paraphrase from 'The Fountainhead'. :-)",1227365544

372951,comment,372471,372471,0,0,Allocator2008,,,"This article is grotesquely misleading. It misuses the word ""virtual"". Virtual reality meaning a simulation hasn't a thing to do with virtual particles in quantum field theory. In this case, the strength of the strong nuclear force field in a given point affects the probability amplitude of finding a gluon at that given point, which, in turn, will affect the mass of the area surrounding that point. In the case of the 3 quark proton, the strong nuclear force field has a high strength in the vicinity of the three quarks, therefore, the probability of finding gluons here is higher than outside the 3-quark bounded configuration. Since energy is equivalent to mass, that means the 3-quark bounded configuration will get a higher mass value than the surrounding vacuum, because of the higher prevalence of the strong nuclear force-field carrying gluons within it. This is ordinary, well understood, quantum chromodynamics, similar to quantum electrodynamics. There is nothing ""virtual"" about it in the sense of ""less than real"". A particle may be said to be ""virtual"" if is is transient (acts over a short distance or timespan). However its effects are as real as it gets. At the end of day, quantum field theory comes to down calculating probability amplitudes, in this case, the probability of finding gluons in the 3-quark configuration. There isn't anything ""virtual"" or ""magical"" or ""hocus pocus"" about it. And if somebody thinks there is, they shouldn't be writing for a science magazine.",1227364744

The upgrades come some thick and fast that code soon goes out of date and can even be viewed by the community as ""bad"" - yet it was using standards that were ""good"" months earlier!<p>The way I tend to look at it is like a car. If I have an old app, I treat it like an old car. I'll keep it updated where necessary, but I'll stick to the style of its times. If lots of new gee-whiz features are needed, I'll start a new app. This is less than ideal in certain environments, but if you're agile, working on your own projects, or have the right mindset, it's quite refreshing.",1227364599

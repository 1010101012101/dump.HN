1266620,comment,1266381,1266512,0,0,stewiecat,,,"I have a lot of experience with this.  Did three Ironman tri's (with 12 half-IM's thrown in for training) during my late 20's.<p>While training for the first Ironman, I changed jobs to one that required a commute and a fixed ""out the door"" time to beat traffic.  After starting this, every Friday was cold-day.  I'd get so rundown from a lack of sleep, only 8 hours/night, that I'd get a cold every Friday.  After knocking off for 10+ on Friday night it'd be gone Saturday.<p>Sleep is also prominent in modern training programs.  The old school train-till-you-die method of unfocused bulk mileage and little rest is gone.  Nowadays endurance athletes have narrowly focused training workouts (speed work, intervals, weights, long & easy, etc) with a balance of days off and entire weeks of reduced training volume for recovery where the emphasis is put on rest so the body can rebuild and prepare for the next training cycle.",1271293115

So we stripped the tagging and shipped with just the folder feature.<p>Perhaps unsurprisingly, there turned out to be customers that had built a whole lot of import/export/processing infrastructure around the tags, and were less than happy about having to reimplement it all using folders. Plus they had a ton of tagged data and we hadn't included a tool to convert the old format to the new one. (Because we thought noone were using the tagging feature, it had only been in the product for a single release.)<p>The lesson learned is that released features are similar to published APIs: If you remove or change them you will inevitably break something for someone.",1271292897

If deltas were stored, you'd have to reconstruct those revisions from the deltas, which would make it <i>really</i> expensive to do things like, ""I want to look at every article as it appeared at noon on April 1, 2007"".<p>In the live DB, I think just because it's cheaper to get a ton of storage, esp. for rarely-retrieved old revisions, than to add the overhead of computing deltas and applying them to reconstruct revisions. In particular, you'd have to compute a diff for <i>every</i> edit in that situation, whereas currently MediaWiki only computes diffs when a user requests to view one from the ""history"" tab, which is a tiny proportion of all edits.",1271292612

1266597,comment,1266362,1266362,0,0,jsz0,,,"Valid point but the author misses the mark a bit. Apple probably won't move away from ARM but instead enhance and mutate their own ARM design. The A5, A6 and beyond could retain 100% binary compatibility but also offer many new features. At that point it would technically be an ARM CPU but to be used to its maximum you would need a compiler ready to support all those new features. In the case of a product like the iPad that was unveiled to the public only 2 months before it went on sale it would be difficult for third parties to keep up. From Apple's perspective sharing this type of information publicly on a reasonable time frame to support third parties could take away a significant advantage they have with in-house CPU development. If you're going to tell your competition 6 months ahead of time what you're doing by the time you ship a product they're going to be less than 6 months behind you.",1271291970

(They thought that was too cheap, if you’re wondering.) It didn’t affect publishers’ margins, nor authors’ royalties, since Amazon.com was selling below cost to promote its Kindle platform. But still, publishers were uncomfortable with the idea of books being that cheap. So they went to war and forced Amazon.com to bump up prices to $13-$15, in exchange for taking a lower royalty on each sale.<p>Let’s review. Amazon.com was eating it in order to allow you to buy books for ten bucks, instead of twenty or thirty, while paying authors the same royalty. Publisher intervenes, and now books are more expensive for you, while the author gets less. Also, the publisher gets less. Oh, and I didn’t mention this, but during the war, Amazon.com took down all the “Buy” buttons for Macmillan books, so you definitely couldn’t buy them no matter how much you wanted to and nobody made any money at all.

Government corruption and nepotism was limited during Japanese rule, but reached a fever pitch once the KMT arrived on the island in force.

Maintaining all of the mocks became very expensive. At one point it was determined that maybe half of the development time became devoted to test case maintinance. Eventually it was decided to abandon unit tests and just do integration testing. Another project was more xmpp based. I started with TDD but eventual gave up because the architure was in flux.

1266526,story,,,10,3,uncoder,"CTO, VP of Engineering and CEO (again)",,"About a year ago, there was a long discussion about CTO vs. VP of Eng. where a CTO who was acting as VP of Eng. was getting paranoid about the CEO wanting to hire a new VP of Eng. with the VP of Eng. directly reporting to the CEO. Here is the link: http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=509571<p>I found the discussion very interesting. My situation is slightly different - I'm the Founder and CTO of a six-year old company, with no CEO initially. We then brought on a CEO, who then brought on a VP of Eng. & VP of Marketing.\nThese hires were with my active participation and involvement. For the first two years, I worked with the VP of Eng., and along the way, discovered many gaps in day-to-day execution, the result of which I was also ""half"" VP of Eng. It was very awkward, because the VP of Eng. was essentially the CEO's pick, and the VP of Eng. had a free ride with me doing the work and him taking the credit. However, it turned out that the key folks reporting to the VP of Eng. saw through this, the CEO could not keep propping up the VP of Eng. and the VP of Eng. was forced out. Of course, I am pretty sure that the CEO, to this day, keeps thinking that I caused the VP of Eng. to be dysfunctional and forced him out,\neven though the board and the rest of the company knows fully well that that was not the case, and that it was more important for me, as a founder and a large shareholder, I had a stake in the VP of Eng. success. In any case, we went through another VP of Eng., and after two more years, he was also out, this time he could not work with the CEO. Eventually, the third VP of Eng was brought on, but for him to be successful, myself and the rest of the exec team\nhave to walk extremely carefully, and back off any questioning of his work, and the engineering team is increasingly isolated from the rest of the organization. Moreover, given the prior history, my relationship with the CEO\nis very delicate, with me having to play a much less reduced role. He tends to brush off any suggestion from the CTO as not sound business sense, and any suggestion, even when constructive, becomes a negative comment on the\nwork of others. Given my position in the company, the stake in its success, I cannot quit. Naturally, working in this environment can be difficult, since there is really no one who is there to offer support for me.

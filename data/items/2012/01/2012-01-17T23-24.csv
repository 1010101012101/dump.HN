All you have is conjecture until there's more information available, and that's not useful at all.<p>But since we're in the land of conjecture, let's think about this: Google, a massive corporation generating huge profits, suddenly decides to scrape a Kenyan database piecemeal (rather than just sucking up the whole thing at once before starting, like an intelligent person would do), then engages telemarketers to fraudulently cold call a bunch of small businesses in the hopes of selling them web hosting.<p>Now, how much income do you suppose that would bring in? a few hundred thousand? Maybe a million if they're lucky? Would it even be worth a multinational's time and effort to cold-call selling websites, even if it were totally kosher? I doubt it. Add to that the negative press that a scam like this would bring when it's eventually exposed and it's well into the realm of ludicrous. Even if this were supposedly perpetrated by the most evilest nastiest company in the world, I'd have the same argument (money).<p>So, we're left with the next most likely possibility: a small number of people with internal access to Google's infrastructure, for whom a few hundred thousand to a million dollars worth of sales would be quite lucrative.<p>And if you were in Google's shoes, with this happening somewhere in your GIANT company, what would you do?  If you answered ""push out a press statement telling all right away"", you'd be betraying a fundamental lack of understanding in how large corporations work. Their size makes them slow.

Essentialy by blocking (sometimes unrolling) loops and consuming data in a cache aware fashion. Given the latency in accessing the data directly from memory, getting the data off the cache can easily speed things up by 10s if not 100s of folds.<p>In otherwords, its the same algorithm just implemented more efficiently.<p>On the other hand is the interesting question if linear algebra can be done fast in a lisp without calling BLAS. I do not have the reference on the top of my head but there were a few papers on ACM where it was shown that lisp can indeed rival fortran speed in linear algebraic computation. I will try and dig it up later. In anycase I suspect that stalin will do a decent job optimizing  a matrix multiplication routine written in lisp. I suspect that a part of the slowdown in clojure is also because it runs on jvm whose safety guarantees (bounds checking and no reordering of instructions) can come with a speed hit.<p>EDIT: here it is <a href=""http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~fateman/papers/lispfloat.ps"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~fateman/papers/lispfloat.ps</a><p>From the abstract:<p><pre><code>  Lisp, one of the oldest higher-level programming languages
  has rarely been used for fast numerical (floating-point)
  computation. We explore the benefits of Common Lisp, an
  emerging new language standard with some excellent
  implementations, for numerical computation.
  We compare it to Fortran in terms of the speed of
  generated code, as well as the structure and convenience
  of the language. There are a surprising number of
  advantages to Lisp, especially in cases where a mixture
  of symbolic and numeric processing is needed
</code></pre>
And the conclusion:<p><pre><code>  In this article we have asserted, and shown through a
  number of examples, that numerical computing in Lisp need
  not be slow, and that many features of Common
  Lisp are useful in the context of numerical computing. We
  have demonstrated that the speed of compiled Common Lisp
  code, though today somewhat slower than that of the best
  compiled Fortran, could probably be as efficient, and in
  some ways superior. We have suggested ways in which the
  speed of this code might be further improved.

When you are building a complex system, you cannot plan as you go, and in some cases your first usable release cannot happen after the first 'sprint'. In this way, agile programming assumes that the programmer cannot make long term development plans, and in fact prevents him from doing so. While this eliminates some of the risk, it also prevents programmers from reasoning about their problem holistically, and can deliver inferior or non functioning solutions for projects that do not happen to fit the model well.<p>This refusal to allow programmers to reason holistically is part of what us critics mean when we say that agile attempts to turn programmers into line workers.<p>Complex projects, like building a jetliner (or the programming equivalent), cannot be ""continuously integrated"" with no up front planning.

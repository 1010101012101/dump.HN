He didn't grow because of demand but because of his dreams, which is the number 1 reason why he failed. It's strange, too, because he wasn't competing to capture market space; nor was he under any sort of deadline to sell the company at a certain valuation.<p>If the author had just kept on making veggie tales like he had been doing before he wanted to grow big, the company would have been fine. Veggie tales was a solid product that had everything going for it.",1204973747

Its just additional overhead and the libraries will ultimately be limited to the same resources native apps have.<p>The only benefit I can think of is if you already have a Java ME based app you would like to port to the iPhone quickly.",1204973661

But I don't think adults should tell kids that things that are clearly fantasy are, in fact, reality.  Kids actually believe things that adults tell them, so I think you should try to tell the truth to kids as much as possible.",1204973624

The article implies that something similar might be at work here.<p>I'm a layman on this subject, so if anybody knows anything about this it would be interesting to hear.",1204973030

On the one hand that's wonderful and part of me wants to love a system that offers free educational access to all.  On the other hand, you see the influence of a value economy on it:  there's little motivation to finish for those who enjoy it.  I think there's a sweet spot in the middle where people pay just enough to assign value to a semester of schooling, but not so much that they're crippled by debt upon graduation.  In an ideal world, for me, tuition costs should be for engendering value rather than recuperating costs.",1204972650

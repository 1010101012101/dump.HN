I don't know the percentages of each one in the total, but to state that drastically fewer licenses would not lead to much less revenue seems somewhat disconnected from reality.<p>> So first question: Why not 30? 300? Perpetual? 3 months?<p>Because, like I said, it's a compromise.  We as a society pick a number that best balances the needs of IP producers and consumers.  In theory.  In practice, I don't think the numbers are ideal right now, and should be rebalanced.  However, there's a big difference between some rejigging and throwing out the system in its entirety.<p>> And I'm not averse to just keeping pharma patents until we some something else figured out - but let's not pretend that because scientists today are funded by a messy, inefficient system, they must always be so funded.<p>Democracy is a messy, inefficient system too: it just happens to be better than the alternatives.

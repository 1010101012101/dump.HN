My partner was 41 and had done things I hadn't even imagined.  He was so smart, so seasoned, and knew the ropes about so many things that he saved us both countless hours and dead ends.  And I was able to do things he never had a chance to learn.  We made a great team.<p>Now I'm on the other side of that relationship.  And would love to do it again with someone in their 20's.  I have a million ideas that come from years of real world experience and not enough time to act upon them.  (One of the reasons I'm here.)",1251662218

794897,comment,794592,794742,0,0,rstocker99,,,"It's actually more like asking a candidate airplane pilot to fly in a simulator.<p>I'm personally a huge fan of interview questions that require candidates to do tasks that are as close as possible to what they'll actually need to do on the job.<p>For devs this means coding, designing etc. For testers this means creating test cases and for a UI designer it means doing UI design. If someone made me interview an accountant I'd have them do some actual case questions for accounting. I wouldn't be able to tell if they did them particularly well but that's a whole other issue and is probably why no one has asked me to interview any accountants.<p>Like many other folks that interview using this strategy I've come to it after seeing how many people have a great resume but are completely unable to do the actual work. This is often true even for people that pass reference checks with flying colors. After getting burned a few times you realize the benefits of getting people to demonstrate their abilities before hiring them.<p>The counter point to getting developers to code during an interview (and presumably to accountants doing accounting problems in an interview) usually takes a form like ""I can't write code in an interview setting b/c X, Y and Z but I'm a great coder under normal conditions"".<p>I'm sure this is true for <i>some</i> people and it is unfortunate that those high quality people miss out on jobs they are qualified for. It's also a loss for you as a hiring manager. But as a hiring manager you're better off with an interview process that mistakenly screens out some good people if it ensures fewer poor hires that you ultimately have to fire. A poor hire is very expensive in terms of time, team morale, money etc.",1251662170

The numbers for the VA are similar. When you consider that they managed to do this without being able to use many of the cost-control tools that normal plans would be able to (like being able to use bulk to negotiate lower pharmaceutical rates), it's pretty amazing. Yes, government us usually quite inefficient - but they're got a pretty good record when it comes to health care delivery.<p>As for TR Reid, he knows more than most about exactly how the UK's NHS works, and how it doesn't result in everybody dying - he lived in London for several years (he was the WaPo bureau chief there), and his son (who was in my son's history class) had several serious hospitalizations.",1251662025

794890,comment,789671,793145,0,0,apotheon,,,">  is there a reason to suppose that a drive with 'bad sectors coming off the line' actually has a higher expected failure rate?<p>If it doesn't hurt me to choose a different brand or a different model line, the more relevant question becomes ""Is there sufficient reason to believe that a drive with 'bad sectors coming off the line' <i>doesn't</i> have a higher <i>actual</i> failure rate?""  It's better to be safe than sorry, as they say, and my experience is that once a drive starts degrading, it keeps degrading.<p>The reason CPUs can often be sold at a lower capacity than originally intended without worrying about an increased likelihood of later failure is because transistors are discrete devices; if half of them fail, as long as the rest can still be accessed, you just have a CPU with the same architecture and half the transistors.  On a hard drive, however, permanently hosed sectors represent actual problems on <i>part of</i> a single discrete device -- the hard drive platter -- and it's entirely possible that the rest of the device may be affected by this.  Magnetic areas on a platter are quite so distinctly segregated as transistors on a chip.<p>> Marking something 'enterprise' grade is often a placebo and has more to do with service, contracts and well-marketed expectations than with actual differences in the goods involved.<p>True -- but when you explicitly use drives that have failed the quality control required for ""enterprise"" drives as your retail consumer grade drives, that kinda changes the landscape a bit.",1251661982

In my case, after a PhD at a top 5 engineering school and a 7 year wait at a Fortune 500 company, I finally got a Green card. I started a company within a month of that, we have over 100 employees (all in the US) and we are hiring today. The generation of PhD's before me used to get their Green Cards in three months. I see a lot of my friends now contemplating a return to India and China. I think this is bad for the US and bad for Silicon Valley.\nIt basically comes down to this, in intellectual fields, the most productive workers are 10X better than the median. Multiple that with a 10X tolerance for risk (which a lot of immigrants with much lower fixed costs and lower expectations from life tend to have) and you are talking about losing someone who is 100X more valuable (in economic terms) than the average worker. If we don't figure out who these people are and insist on having them wait in the H1B line along with everyone else, we are doing ourselves a great disservice. BTW my cofounder is American, also falls in the 100X  category - so this is not a statement about ""all Chinese/Indians are superior to all Americans"". His daughters are learning Chinese as a backup plan.\nBy mixing legal with illegal immigration (due to the relative strength of some of the lobbies) and uber-skilled with somewhat skilled immigration, we are creating a mess.",1251659705

Locked modem costs 50€, but you can use those cards with any 3G modem and most smartphones (I tether with a soft-unlocked iPhone).<p>It's hard to get a SIM card: anonymous SIM cards (even for data traffic) don't exist there, and it can be a pain to get a pay-as-you-go if you're a visitor (that's because of the 11M terrorist attacks, yeah, gbye privacy!).<p>Also, be aware of internet coffees. A good price is 1€-1,5€ for 1h..<p>Starbucks don't have WiFi, but some McDonalds have it. You have to buy something (I love McFlurrys!) and ask for a WiFi card (if they have wifi, of course, you'll see a sticker outside). Just connect to the open Wifi and type the number that is in the card (that will give you 30 minutes of navigation).<p>And... good luck!",1251659149

We now are regularly number 1 or 2 on google organic search for our exact key phrase. We're seeing very little traffic and zero enquiries which is very disheartening.<p>However if we run a PPC campaign for the same keyphrase we get 20 - 50 enquiries per day (dependant on our budget)  and 5 to 10 enquiries.<p>Our paid ad is above our own organic listing and the paid wins hands down every time. If we stop the ads, another ad beats us to the click.<p>I think ads are being clicked far more than we realise.<p>We would love to rely on organic traffic but only paid traffic gets results.",1340629198

This is especially true in Tamil Nadu, where the pro-Tamil movement altered the political landscape for ever. Congress, the largest political party in India has never won an election in Tamil Nadu after the pro-Tamil movement. in 1963, the constitution was amended to make it explicit that English and Hindi could be used for communication between state and central governments.<p>I think the status-quo works out well for everyone.

These events effectively changed the Portuguese regime from an authoritarian dictatorship (the Estado Novo, or ""New State"") into a democracy, and produced enormous social, economic, territorial, demographic, and political changes in the country (...)</i><p><i>Although the regime's political police, PIDE, killed four people before surrendering, the revolution was unusual in that the revolutionaries did not use direct violence to achieve their goals.

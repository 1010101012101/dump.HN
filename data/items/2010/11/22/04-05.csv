Have you looked at the price of money these days? 2%? 4%? Junk spread as low as 1-2? With QE the price of money is being artificially driven down to drive investment.

This article talks about ""but-head"" sentence prefixes.  Another example would be disingenuous greetings, such as asking ""how's life?"", ""how's your day been?"", etc, even though we don't really care.  Proof that we don't care: The way people get uncomfortable when someone actually honestly answers ""actually my day's been terrible because of A, B, C ..."".<p>This article raises some interesting points that I've thought of myself sometimes.  Before reading this article, I had made the assumption that it was just protocol.  I assumed that there was something ... missing in the English language: Often times, when we use such set expressions, we're actually trying to convey some sort of emotion rather than the actual message of the words.  ""Hey how's it going"" is actually suppose to mean ""I am acknowledging your presense, and may or may not wish to engage in conversation with you unless your mood complements mine..."".<p>After reading this article, I can't help but find myself agreeing with the author.

Westerners focus on the censorship, the lack of democracy, the human rights violations, the communism, or the capitalism.  The image continues to be one of a crazy communist dictatorship with no direction and no morals that just happened to get lucky with some twisted capitalism.<p>But capitalism is only a part of their success.  Everyone knows you should do some free trade and open up the economy.  The really hard part of running a country is managing the powerful internal special interest groups and getting all the systemic incentives aligned correctly so that people work together to produce better government and a better economy.  Russia and many others have tried capitalism and failed because their political systems sucked.<p>The triumph of the Chinese leadership is how they have adapted the Singapore model, managed their powerful internal special interest groups and an insanely diverse geography and ethnic populations that don't speak the same language, keeping the country together, while getting a growing number of people to work on improving government and the economy and moving towards creating a fair, unified, and stable environment for business and wealth and improving peoples lives.<p>edit: I suppose I really know nothing about the moral standing of the Chinese core leadership.

Debt fueled bubbles make losses so much worse for everyone.

I'm sure if you ask students, many of them would say taking the test is ""surprisingly hard,"" are shortcuts justified for them too?  I'm sure a building contractor will tell you keeping track of and in compliance with environmental and safety regulations is hard, but we expect them to do it nonetheless, because that's his/her job!<p>Ultimately, whichever method allows the instructor to most effectively perform his or her job is best, and maybe that's question banks.  Cases like this one are notable because they call into question the stance that using banks is as effective/more efficient.<p>Good luck on your degree!",1290399519

Degrees are used as a quick proxy for minimum competency, right? Well, if our highschools act as little more than babysitting systems that push kids through no matter what (qualification to say this: I date a public highschool teacher in Maryland, which is supposedly the best public school system in the country. Consequently, I see it first-hand.), HS diplomas will be rendered irrelevant.<p>This, in turn, means that college degrees become the base level qualification required for a showing of minimum competency.

Reality is, human brains move very slowly and most often in predictable paths. Therefore, the odds of you hearing of a breakthrough in your chosen discipline on any given day are approximately the same as winning a national lottery. But the probability of hearing on any given day about inventive false starts that will eventually lead nowhere or something some intelligent person said somewhere that might have a glimmer of promise approaches one. These constant bursts of stimulation are sufficiently pleasurable, if you can't clamp down on them, to occupy your entire day. Here's a litmus test: If you read HackerNews from start to dregs and are let down because you didn't find anything really new, you're reading too frequently. Don't read it or anything like it for a month. If you have the same experience after a month, extend the wait to two months, and so on. Genuine novelty comes along once in a blue moon.

7566480,comment,7565238,7565915,0,0,waps,,,"If that&#x27;s true, how would you explain that tensions like that, and much, much, much worse exist everywhere that minority lives ? Especially in places where said minority is in fact a majority.<p>I mean, I&#x27;m all for tolerance. But denying the problem makes it worse. Even denying that this particular &quot;minority&quot; is particularly problematic, it might seem discriminatory, but it&#x27;s also the blatant in-your-face truth. That makes it worth pointing out, and worth asking the simple question : why ?<p>In most religions the founder was the instigator of large-scale warfare (usually a foreignor or otherwise non-local person that managed to whip a large group of people into open revolt, like Moses or Muhammad). In islam, this is particularly obvious, as it&#x27;s prophet probably came from Syria, and is responsible for massacres totalling at least 10000 bodies.<p>But islam is an exception in the opposite way of Christianity. Where Christianity is famous for choosing not to fight in situations where reasonable people would probably have picked up arms. Additionally Christianity is famous for having guilt for actions that Christians at best contributed to, but that no reasonable person can consider state actions. America is a good example, who feel guilty for massacring native Americans. Well, reading the history books, tell me this : what killed native Americans ? Conflict with the colonists ? Or diseases the colonists carried (which they did not know they carried at the time. And yes, some assholes existed. But look at historical massacres in, say, India. Tell me this : were they an accidental situation + a few assholes ? Or were they a systematically coordinated extermination campaign organized and carried out by an army ?). Good look finding a Turk that feels guilt about the Armenian massacre. Or a Pakistani that feels guilty about the partition massacres, about causing the biggest massacre of the 20th century, and then doing it again a decade later. Or an Iranian that feels guilt about the massacres they committed recently (ie. 30 years ago) in Iraq. Or an Iraqi that feels guilty about what Irak&#x27;s army did in Iran. Or a Maroccan that feels guilty about what happened in Western Sahara to the indigenous population. Or ... Sorry to state the obvious, but this is part of muslim culture.<p>Islam is famous for committing huge massacres in small conflicts. This was true when islam was 1 year old (and 200 years away from being a religion), and it&#x27;s true today. And yes, we do know islam was famous for committing massacres when it was very young, because we have written accounts of negotations between the prophet&#x27;s emissaries and local leaders that say exactly that, both in the islamic history version of them, and in kept records. Muslim religious history accounts, incidentally, don&#x27;t deny this : Islam massacred an entire city in a conflict was essentially about the location of Muhammad&#x27;s tent camp, which was judged not sufficiently prestigious by him (He was a slave -and other wares- trader at the time). Another city was massacred because they did not let a woman &quot;marry&quot; one of the muslim commanders. This is not denied in those historical accounts, this is told, and presented as the way people should behave. What was massacred in the name of Islam recently, I don&#x27;t think requires any real explanations.<p>But all this sort of talk, while it can prepare one for what is coming (&quot;he who doesn&#x27;t know history is doomed to repeat it&quot; and all), is water under the bridge. Whether or not we tolerate islam is not a decision we can make, or anyone can make really. This is going to frustrate a lot of people, but it is simply not how history works. Everybody seems to be under the ridiculous impression that this is the first time Europe sees massive muslim immigration, that racism is new, or that current attitudes to immigrants are particularly innovative somehow ... when of course in reality it&#x27;s more like the tenth time this happens. Of course, the ten previous times can pretty much be summarized like this : muslims move in, get into ever more conflicts, commit genocide but suffer military defeat, get shot/knifed in large numbers and islam gets outlawed.<p>So let&#x27;s ask ourselves the question : if history is to be learned from, what&#x27;s coming is a large scale &quot;terrorist&quot; act, not with a single perpetrator, but a large group of muslims (say 500-1000 or more) committing a large scale massacre in a large European city, then the local army moves in, and after the soldiers see the dead bodies &quot;somehow&quot; every muslim gets killed, including a couple hundred that weren&#x27;t part of the &quot;terrorist&quot; act.<p>What will the response to that be ?<p>And sorry to point out the obvious : most people are against war because of the very real costs wars have on normal people. That is the real cause of tolerance, not some moral imperative. The (justified) fear of war, fear of conflict. Needless to say, when the generally observed cost of not going to war massively exceeds the cost of going to war, this will reverse. So the response of modern states is not going to be all that different from the response of the hundreds of states that have historically faced this issue.",1397140841

I considered it breathtakingly clean and elegant (compared to C and Pascal).. for the few things it was good at (e.g. expert systems).. but utterly unsuitable as a general-purpose language / paradigm. I felt the same way about Standard ML (it was the dominant FP language before Haskell became big). &quot;Wow, writing a simple input/output transformer (e.g. academic compiler) or doing some basic math is so clean and elegant with this! Everything else.. not so much.&quot;<p>In contrast, Forth actually changed my thinking. According to Charles Moore, Forth&#x27;s creator, proper software development with Forth meant finding just the right set of words, the right vocabulary, for the problem domain. Once that was accomplished writing down the program logic became trivial. Note that in Forth functions are called &quot;words&quot;,  are usually very short, and indeed word-like. So you end up with code like &quot;ARM 90 DEGREES ROTATE&quot;.<p>As I said my approach to programming was changed by the exposure to Forth. I aim to discover/define an efficient &quot;vocabulary&quot; for the problem domain in every language. That is not the same as designing a &quot;domain-specific language&quot; by the way. DSLs usually go much further, making up a syntax of their own. I do not like DSLs at all. Mostly because of the associated learning curve forced upon you by every new DSL and by the usually poor tool support.<p>EDIT: Removed needlessly trollish part",1397139418

Just stick it up on Kickstarter or wherever. There have to be plenty of unhappy sysadmins and IT managers who would readily chip in right at the moment, and the publicity should also help attract support from a much broader group of people who normally wouldn&#x27;t even think about these things. The hoopla should also hopefully embarrass some big companies into making useful contributions to the pot. (Due credit to FB and Google for funding the IBB in the first place.) Strike while the iron is hot.<p>Yes, bug bounties on their own aren&#x27;t a sufficient solution: more systematic, less <i>ad hoc</i> approaches are needed too, no doubt. But nonetheless I think it makes sense to double down on bug bounties, for two reasons. First, bug bounties are <i>an</i> approach that seems to be fairly successful, though the IBB money probably wasn&#x27;t part of Neel Mehta&#x27;s motivation to start inspecting OpenSSL at all. There may be better, though more ambitious, approaches, but if there&#x27;s one thing that seems evident from the recent SSL/TLS bug fiasco it&#x27;s that making the perfect, or even the great, the enemy of the pretty good is counterproductive here. Second, probably nothing will motivate the maintainers of OpenSSL etc. to actually implement (and keep implementing) systematic, proactive changes better than the constant, realistic threat of being pantsed again by bounty-hunting outsiders. (Remember: all technical problems are social problems in disguise, just as all social problems are technical problems in disguise. ;) ) Or failing that, fairly frequent bounty-funded bug finds would at least serve as a warning to the rest of us that the maintainers aren&#x27;t doing very well.",1397139233

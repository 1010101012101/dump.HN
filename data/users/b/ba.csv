Later moved to C, C++, Java, PHP, JavaScript.<p>Founded a couple of open source projects, most remarkable being flamerobin.org, which is now the default administration GUI for the open-source FirebirdSQL DBMS. I got really close with people in that community (had beers with most core developers ;) and even presented some papers/sessions at three Firebird conferences. I also run the official Firebird FAQ website at firebirdfaq.org.<p>Wrote some shareware software available at guacosoft.com. Most successful product is a home-inventory application called Attic Manager.<p>From 2009 got interested into web space, but mostly kept alive by making accounting software.<p>In 2013, focused on social-gaming. Built two successful Facebook games with 150.000+ players which gave me enough cash to support developing of my future indie projects.<p>In 2014, tested waters on Android, built a space shooter game Drone Invaders in just 23days: http://bigosaur.com/blog/23days<p>In 2015, built and released my first game on Steam: http://store.steampowered.com/app/363670<p>You can see my progress on my Twitter: @mbabuskov.<p>You can e.mail me at milan_at_bigosaur dot_com.",1314103449,1452727975

The computers of today are faster, but the quality of the software has declined considerably as people have concentrated on implementing flashy interfaces over solid functionality.<p>I have worn many hats during my career, but they all have these things in common: 1.

If you leave a mess, someone is going to have to clean it up - of course, it&#x27;s best not to leave a mess in the first place, but do document what you&#x27;ve done so the next guy will have an easier time of it.<p>I am the sole inventor of a patent in the field of networking.<p>Hobbies: Amateur (&quot;ham&quot;) radio, weather spotting (&quot;is that cloud rotating?&quot;  &quot;is the wind above 58MPH?&quot;  &quot;are there any hailstones coming down that are 1 inch in diameter or greater?&quot; => call it in!), playing music by ear, woodworking, and photography: chemical, mixed-media, and digital.<p>I have worked for a wide variety of companies in and out of Silicon Valley, as well as the (US) Federal government and some universities.

barbaraconelli,0,1,0.0,6,0,"Barbara Conelli is an internationally published bestselling author, seasoned travel writer specializing in Italy, and Chiquenist on the mission to bring Fantastic Fearless Feminine Fun into women's lives. In her charming, delightful and humorous Chique Books filled with Italian passion, Barb invites women to explore Italy from the comfort of their home with elegance, grace and style, encouraging them to live their own Dolce Vita no matter where they are in the world.<p>Barb learned to read and write at the age of four, and a year later, she wrote her first bestselling book that became a big hit in local kindergartens. She turned into an overnight success that lasted for twelve exciting hours. Since then, she has never separated from her writing endeavors. Barb writes even in her sleep and she can often be seen sitting on her bed at three a.m. with a flashlight frantically processing her somnambulant ideas. A born nomad and adventurer, she's been there, she's done it, and she's not afraid to write about it.<p>An entertaining storyteller, Barb has a unique ability to capture the magical atmosphere of the places she writes about. Through the pages of her books, Barb takes your hand and guides you through the irresistible beauty, captivating secrets, unrepeatable spell and fugitive moments of Italy. She makes them come alive easily and spontaneously, and her writing is like a magic carpet that carries you to Italy and back in the blink of an eye. She introduces you to fascinating women who have created the face of Italy, lifts the shroud of their mysteries, and reveals adorable places off the beaten track where the authentic Italian heart hasn't stopped beating.<p>As a naturally curious person who loves traveling, meeting new people and discovering their life stories, Barbara founded Chique Show, an entertaining radio show for women and about women. On Chique Show, Barbara shares her Dolce Vita adventures and interviews inspiring women authors and experts who show listeners how to live their sweet life with gusto.<p>Barb lives between New York and Milan, and as a real globetrotter, she's always on the move, accompanied by her adorable and very spoiled beagle. To her, writing is like breathing, and she's currently working on her new book.<p>WEBSITE: http://www.barbaraconelli.com",1321111614,1452898448

One is called BR designed for bands, stand ups, singers, dancers etc lost on facebook and Youtube but uniquely brought together live on BR.  The second is Fundbus a live investment project allowing users to give and buy across the board.  In between training, acting, directing, coaching, writing, touring and cooking up start-ups, I shoot projects and shows.  I've worked with 1000s actors, made movies, shows, games and sites and once when I was ten made a BMX ramp made out of my best friends backdoor.

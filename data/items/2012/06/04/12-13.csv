4063749,comment,4062878,4063653,2,0,jonknee,,,"> For example, when I am browsing through photos in Preview (with arrow keys) and I come across one I do not want, I should be able to hit the delete key to delete the photo, but no, I can't do that. I have to stop browsing, find the photo in the side bar, right click and select 'Move to Trash'.<p>Command delete works here. It makes some sense as it's not likely you'll accidentally delete one of your photos that way.<p>> Or, when I close all the windows for a given program (usually there is just one), the program stays open until I navigate through the menu to explicitly quit.<p>That's not necessarily true in Lion (through a feature called Automatic Termination which requires the app to explicitly support it). Take Preview again for example. Open a photo, close the photo and then go back to another app. Check the Dock. This actually drives me nuts as I commonly switch app context's with command-tab and having a disappearing app makes this difficult. It seems like an odd feature to me because the process actually remains alive (check Activity Monitor), it's just in a state that makes it easy to kill if resources become scarce. I have 20GB of RAM, resources very rarely become scarce so all it does is end up hiding stuff I'd rather see.",1338814663

With blackholes, it simply has a curved trajectory, that orbits/crash into the black hole, thus sending absolutely no photons our way, thus no light, thus black.<p>There is absolutely nothing mysterious about black holes, just edge effects because they're not even remotely comparable to what we can readily observe, and most closely related to the aspect of physics we understand the less : gravity.<p>Schwarzchild radius in this case is a cool term, but it's a very simple concept, it's just the distance from the center of an object at wich photons start having non-collision trajectories  (i.e. some light escapes if it has the right trajectory).<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schwarzschild_radius"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schwarzschild_radius</a><p>Essentially. nothing particular and in fact there are event horizons inside existing matter, just that noone cares since it's inside.<p>If you remove mass from a black hole it gets bigger, nothing new or special there, it would work the exact same way with our sun too, as when it will become a red giant, far bigger yet much lighter.<p>If you keep removing mass from your black hole, at some point it's radius crosses it's schwarzchild radius and tadaam it's a star instead .. still the same object though.<p>About the hawkins radiation, I have no clue, but whatever they are they seem to be considered minimal compared to the influx of mass/energy from galaxy collisions, galaxy eating and all that.",1338814444

Taylor guitars owns the company which has the licence to harvest 75% of Cameroon's (and now the World's) supply of Ebony, effectively giving them a massive amount of control over the market (I believe they are the biggest supplier of Ebony at this point in time).<p>Bob Taylor (owner of Taylor Guitars) discovered that to find one tree worth of 'A-Grade' wood, 20 trees had to be chopped and left to biodegrade in the forest. He also discovered that the only difference between the A and B grade wood is slight colouration, as opposed to the deep, jet black we're all used to in Ebony, but there are no functional differences.<p>In response to this he began to pay lumberjacks the same amount for B grade wood as A grade, selling at the same price, effectively ignoring the grading system.<p>The result is that my next guitar might have a vanilla streak in the fretboard, but it also reduced the amount of wood used to create it 20 fold, and that's something I can live with.",1338813016

Let's say the author has a good command over the language and accordingly can encode the X% of the information. thankfully the medium is not lossy, so the loss again happens at the reader end of the communication. Depending on the reader, this end can result from 0(throw away the book after a few paras) to X%. The reader end of the communication can be fixed only by the reader itself, solely by sticking to negotiating the protocols with multiple authors... i.e. read more to retain more.\nMakes you wonder is the platform (written text) broken? now it's really really old, and if you pick up a paper book - how much different it is than picking up an Indus valley clay tablet as far the intelligence of the medium is concerned.

There are no standard language features for very basic things like namespaces and modules, also what it provides for OOP is so confusing that it makes people want to roll their own OO system from scratch. Objects as dictionaries and first-class functions make it possible to implement those features in hundreds of ways and almost every JavaScript program tends at least in some places to use some own, original solution for one of the very basic problems of structuring programs, because it is so easy to built one. It is good that this is possible, it is bad that people _have to_ do this (or choose one of the countless existing solutions) before they can actually write the program they want to write.<p>A lot of the problems would go away if the following was part of the language and present in every browser:<p>* namespaces/modules<p>* a sensible OO system people would actually enjoy using<p>* the ability to require/import/include a file/module<p>* the functionality Underscore.js provides<p>Then, at least the basic structure of the code would be consistent across programs from various people, and I wouldn't have to work out the details of yet another OO system, yet another way of just laying out the code across functions/objects each time I want to read another JavaScript program or yet another way of doing function () {}.bind that works across the browsers (here the problem is also the long time it takes for the majority of people to install a browser new enough to adopt the revised standards). And it's not only about reading code, how do you write an object-oriented refactoring tool if every program realizes OO in its own distinct way?<p>The situation is probably slightly better with server side JS where you are free to adapt the newest version of the language/runtime and also the server-side frameworks at least to some extend tend to encourage to use a common structure for all the modules.",1338811311

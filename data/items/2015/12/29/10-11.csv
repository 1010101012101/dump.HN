10806126,comment,10802610,10805384,0,0,dom96,,,"Interesting points. I personally consider Nim&#x27;s metaprogramming to be the best there is, although I must admit that I have not tried D&#x27;s yet. Let me try to give you some reasons why I love Nim (I&#x27;ll try to touch on all the points you&#x27;ve made about D) :)<p>Nim includes templates (declarative metaprogramming), and macros (procedural metaprogramming). The latter gives you access to Nim&#x27;s AST. Macros (and compile-time functions) are evaluated using Nim&#x27;s VM. The VM supports the full language, with the exception of FFI, but you do get special compile-time functions for reading files and executing external processes at compile-time so it&#x27;s already very powerful!<p>Nim compiles to C/C++ so interfacing with C (and C++) could not get easier. Have not tried writing a macro for my editor which converts a C definition into Nim, sounds like a fun thing to implement.<p>> As far as I know (correct me if I&#x27;m wrong!) there&#x27;s no way to declare pure functions in Nim. This is something I do all the time in D!<p>By pure I assume you mean &quot;side-effect free&quot;? If so there is: <a href=""http://nim-lang.org/docs/manual.html#pragmas-nosideeffect-pragma"" rel=""nofollow"">http://nim-lang.org/docs/manual.html#pragmas-nosideeffect-pr...</a><p>> Nim has memory-safety only when using the GC while D has decoupled it from the allocation strategy. D&#x27;s memory-safety is actually part of the type-system (as function annotations) and I absolutely love it!<p>Going to need to look into that. Sounds awesome!<p>In any case, you should definitely give Nim another chance. I can certainly say that I will do the same for D :)\nThank you for taking the time to write this up!",1451386268

Banks don&#x27;t transform savings into productive investments, they print money. When they give (say) a $1 million loan to a business they&#x27;re writing $1 million of new money into existence in their account, money which is just as good as printed cash. Their ability to do so is not much affected by whether people save money or splurge it all on expensive cars and goods, because either way the money remains in the banking system and the banks can make loans using it.<p>Also, it&#x27;s not realistic to expect people to vote with their money and choose a bank that is safe and makes prudent investments. Teams of experts with specialised knowledge who do this as their full-time job can&#x27;t figure that out; how is your average Joe with a full-time job of his own and no industry experience meant to? Worse still, with fractional-reserve banking if enough people believe that a bank will fail then the resulting run on the bank will cause it to fail, at which point you&#x27;d best hope you got your money out in time. If people don&#x27;t trust the banking system as a whole, it doesn&#x27;t force banks to make prudent investments, it causes bank failures and people keep their money under the mattress because even if they could figure out which banks are investing well those banks are still likely to fail due to bank runs.",1451385769

Bubble thinking makes banks take risks that they are blind to. I&#x27;m not super familiar with how debt is regulated in the US, but in The Netherlands the mortgage industry has been much more tightly regulated since 2008. If it is the governments task to regulate debt, then a mass default of course implies that they failed to do that properly.<p>If it was harder for banks to supply subprime loans, then that would have tempered the fire feeding the bubble, and the crisis could have been smaller.<p>Of course, you could also take a more liberal viewpoint and not blame it on under-regulation of the government, but instead on mistakes of the big banks. I&#x27;m not that liberal though, so perhaps someone else can explain how liberals think debt crises should be averted. If I&#x27;d have to guess the simple answer would be that they would say the banks should&#x27;ve fallen so that the healthy banks would be the only ones left standing, so the whole event could be a proper free market process (so they also would say the government failed by bailing out some of the banks).",1451384024

Suddenly your bank cannot meet its reserve requirements. However, if the supplier used the same bank everything would be fine. The amount banks can lend is constrained not by how much deposits they currently have, but whether it could cause a net outflow of deposits to other banks in the future.<p>Amongst other things, this means that how profligate a bank can be in lending money depends heavily on how much all the other banks are lending. So long as all the other banks are lending just as much out and their savings terms are competitive, the outflow of loaned funds will be balanced by an inflow of other banks&#x27; loaned funds.

When the companies have all the political power, they do what&#x27;s best for their shareholders - their bottom line. Whatever helps them acquire more profit and revenue. Here, it&#x27;s all about the money.<p>When the government controls the companies (As it is in China), the government does what&#x27;s best for the people in power (the government). And that usually means doing whatever helps them hold onto or increase their power by way of strict authoritarian rules & laws, censorship and all the indirectly related things that go along with it.<p>Their goal is to keep the population under control because that means they get to stay in power. China&#x27;s biggest fear is a revolution or an uprising which is why they&#x27;re so strict when it comes to public demonstrations, censoring things like Tienanmen square, and cracking brutally hard on rights activists and the leaders of these &quot;change-bringers&quot; (Source: <a href=""http://world.time.com/2011/02/26/chinas-fear-of-a-jasmine-revolution/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://world.time.com/2011/02/26/chinas-fear-of-a-jasmine-re...</a>). The last and absolute worst thing that could happen to China is a revolution. They will commit atrocities like you can&#x27;t even begin to imagine to keep that from happening.<p>In the west, you don&#x27;t have to worry about that. Why? Because it&#x27;s bad for business. Not good for profits and not good for revenue. The best environment for capitalism and for businesses to make the most amount of money is one of peace (Source: <a href=""http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2003/jan/22/iraq.economy"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2003/jan/22/iraq.economy</a>)",1451383454

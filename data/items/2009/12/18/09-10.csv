I have a feeling that you already know this.<p>Go to class if it's required, but bring a laptop and work on something you like or surf Hacker News. You don't need to pretend to be paying attention unless the teacher has explicitly banned not paying attention by playing on a laptop.<p>You're ultimately right, of course, your degree is just a piece of paper, especially when it's in philosophy. It has nothing to do with your startup plans. Does that matter? With psychiatric medication, you may very well gain the emotional detachment needed to do something you really don't want to do. I can tell you that the average person is much more capable of doing things they don't like than either you or I. Unfortunately, we in the proletariat do not get to do only things from which we derive happiness. If you do it right, passing college won't even be much more difficult than failing college. It will also be less stressful. This assumes your parents or someone are paying for college. If they aren't, then you should probably just drop out, a philosophy degree is only worth spending someone else's money on.<p>I took about a year off from school to work on a startup. I did this naively hoping not to return, but I went back and actually just technically graduated, except for the midterm I have in about 3 hours and the other midterm I have in about 7 hours. Email me if you want, I'd be happy to give you more details about my personal situation and/or answer questions and give advice.",1261129653

There are laws that could be used to force Google to say turn over your private data. Would not then the same argument apply?<p>On the other hand, the value of being able to use Google, despite its marginal risk, seems quite a good ""exchange"" for many people (that is, the usefulness of say search being weighed off against getting rounded up in say a war on child porn).

Intellectual honesty requires me to admit that, I have absolutely no hard data to back this up, but please hear me out.<p>Many people have been wondering, 'Hey, who are these DST guys that are continuously going long on Facebook at ridiculous valuations?'<p>'They even let employees at places like Facebook and Zynga cash out early!'<p>'Gosh, Russian businessmen must be nice.'<p>Now if I had large sums of money that I wanted laundered, the method right up there at the top of my list is venture capital firm investing exclusively in overseas assets.  Money is laundered via profitable exits on investments in foreign countries.  In fact, strictly speaking, the exit does not even have to be profitable.<p>Unless you are greedy.<p>Which brings me back to Russian businessmen.  Accusing anyone of anything is not the intention here, but a word of caution to Silicon Valley is in order.  In Russia, business is a game played in somewhat less cordial a fashion.

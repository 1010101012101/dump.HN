3064172,comment,3062925,3062925,2,0,tzs,,,"Something like that would have come in handy for me a few minutes ago: I was calculating sqrt(2) to 10 places and sort(3) to 15 places, by hand on pencil and paper, and some of that got a little tedious.<p>I was doing this because I am relearning all the math I once knew but forgot. I'm currently finishing up relearning single-variable calculus, and I'm using Apostol's ""Calculus"" and doing all the exercises. One of the exercises at the end of the chapter on sequences and series of functions asks the student to derive an error estimate for the binomial series expansion of (1-x)^(-1/2), and then asks for the computation of sqrt(2) (using sqrt(2) = 7/5 (1-1/50)^(-1/2)) and sqrt(3) (using sqrt(3) = 1732/1000 (1-176/3000000)^(-1/2)) to 10 and 15 places, respectively.<p>Since pocket calculators would not have been available to the typical student in 1967, I decided it would be cheating to use a modern calculator or computer. I wanted to only use technology I might reasonable have had if I were a freshman in 1967. (Too bad it couldn't have been 1977, when I actually WAS a freshman taking calculus using that book...I had a nice calculator then).",1317592743

In fact, if you throw the mouse in the upper right direction, it will hit the top right corner no matter which edge it hits first. Thus you actually can hit the corner spots without even aiming in a particular square.<p>Try this on a mac: throw your pointer into the top left or top right corners, and press the button.

In a perfect world there would only be one type of memory, unfortunately that would be too expensive and without much benefit versus the current state of the art.<p>For maximum performance (which is required in many instances) you do have to know about the difference between these multiple layers of memory and take appropriate action, even though many times this is abstracted away from you.<p>The problem with ""volatile"" is different in nature - the behavior of volatile is not really portable and in practice it is also useless as higher-level APIs, like POSIX threads, do have better atomic and fence semantics that are more portable.

So employees who have both vested and exercised shares will receive their pro-rated portion of the proceeds as well. It just seems that the founders must hold 93% of the vested shares (21/22.5), which is reasonable given that they started vesting years ago, when they were still in their cereal-selling phase.<p>Addressing the founders' decision to dividend-to-common instead of secondary selling some of their common shares:<p>In a typical venture financing, only preferred shares are sold, and there is a price per share that is set by the round's valuation. After closing, the price per share of the common shares/options is determined by external auditors in what is called a 409A valuation process. This process is a little bit of a game, whereby the company tries to come up with reasons (financial models, market comps, etc.) to depress the price of the common shares relative to preferred. This has the benefit of giving subsequent hires a lower exercise price on their options (and eventual higher profit upon exit.)<p>The price delta between the classes can be as high as 10:1, though it's usually closer to 3:1 and narrows as a company approaches IPO. However, were anyone (founders or employees) to sell common stock in the round, the common price per share would jump to exactly this new clearing price. Since Airbnb is a hot company, it's reasonable to think that buyers would be willing to pay a market price for common that's not far below preferred. And that would mean less upside for all future employees. A dividend-to-common avoids this.<p>Because Airbnb is so young and fast growing, they still need the allure of the upside of stock options to recruit and retain talent. Any sophisticated investor should understand this dynamic. And yet this dividend annoys them because it means there's a wealth transfer occurring that doesn't increase their ownership.<p>Let's assume for a second that I'm right and that all vested/exercised common shareholders will see some of the dividend. As food for thought, what if Airbnb had instead said they were going to spend $21M of their newly raised capital for cash bonuses for anyone who had worked for them more than a year -- distributed per employee via this equation: total hours worked * total value created... would the Valley's response have been less uproarious?",1317591018

Ring is roughly equivalent to WSGI or Rack. However, if you use Django in python you basicly dont ever have to know about WSGI. In Clojure you do want to know about Ring. Thankfully Ring is very simple; its a spec describing request maps and response maps. In addition provides common adapters for various JVM web servers (In the general ring ecosystem there is support for Jetty, Netty (via Aleph/Lamina), Google App Engine (via appengine magic), Servlets, Mongrel2) and middlewares.<p>There are three sets of libraries on top of ring that are commonly used to build sites:<p>## Moustache<p>Probably the closest to raw ring of the three, moustache provides a sophisticated url routing API. Of the three I'm mentioning here it is probably the least suitable for clojure beginners, however it is my personal favorite.<p>## Compojure<p>This was the most popular [noir is apparently on par] and oldest (it predates ring but was rewritten ontop of it in the 0.4.0 release).

I havent had any real experience with Noir myself but it is probably the easiest entry point into web programming in clj.<p>Compojure and Noir both use Hiccup for HTML generation, and Moustache uses Enlive. Enlive is extremely powerful; even if you choose hiccup I would encourage you to take a good look at enlive anyway, the two solutions dont need to be mutually exclusive.<p><pre><code>  [1] Ring: http://github.com/mmcgrana/ring/</code></pre>",1317591009

(He does say that <i>morally</i> this isn't good, but it wouldn't happen often because under Libertarianism there would be a free market in children and so the parents would sell the kid rather than let it starve).<p>Note that the child has the right to leave, so if parents say to their 10 year old, ""We aren't going to provide for you any more"", the parents cannot stop the child from leaving. You might wonder how a 10 year old who leaves is going to earn a living, but under Rothbard's system there would be no child labor laws. On those, he criticizes them because they have ""systematically forcibly prevented children from entering the labor force, thereby privileging their adult competitors"" (yup...child labor laws oppress children). (And of course prostitution would always be an option...Libertarianism, at least as envision by Rothbard, it seems to me would be a paradise for those who like their sex partners young, plentiful, and inexpensive).",1317590313

3064013,comment,3063828,3063828,1,0,phaus,,,"As an online student, I've read many topics on various websites asking this same question. Most of the time the consensus is that most employers won't care where you graduated from as long as you can show them proof of your programming ability. Whether this is in the form of a portfolio or the result of acing a programming interview depends on the employer/interviewer.<p>An exception to this rule that I happen to know a little about is the government sector. If you want to work for the government, sometimes the particular position will require a degree, sometimes it won't. The good news is that for almost all government jobs, they don't care where you get your degree from as long as it is accredited by an institution recognized by the department of education.<p>While the government doesn't care about the particular type of accreditation, you should. There are two types of accreditation that matter in the United States, regional and national. While it might be counter intuitive, national accreditation is not the most prestigious. If you want to ensure that your degree will be accepted by pretty much any employer on the planet, you should get a regionally accredited degree. National accreditation is becoming more accepted, but unfortunately some employers look at national accreditation as ""inferior."" This attitude is even more prevalent in the education system itself, as most universities will not accept transfer credit from a school that is not regionally accredited.<p>My advice to you would be to find a regionally accredited, school with a good curriculum. There are many online schools so you should be able to find one that meets your requirements. Because you have obtained multiple degrees, and because you have a good amount of experience, you could probably even find an online school that will accept you directly into a master's program.<p>Disclaimer: I personally don't have a problem with nationally accredited schools. There are ""diploma mills"" that are regionally accredited so its ridiculous to claim that regional accreditation is better. There are also some nationally accredited schools that get a bad reputation even thought they can be just as good if not better than a regionally accredited school.<p>I went to an online school that was nationally accredited for about a semester, the classes were challenging and I felt that  I worked hard for my grades. When I wanted to change my major, I couldn't find a regionally accredited school that would accept the credit.",1317589638

I started off dropping out of Chicago for money reasons, and lucked into a sysadmin/programming job with the University.  I was able to move laterally until I found something that fit me better than my original gig; I stuck it out for a few years until the private sector started returning my calls.<p>I am largely self-taught, which has its advantages and the obvious disadvantages, particularly as how I am the sort of learner who needs the social aspects of classroom interaction to really pick stuff up fast.  But I discovered that taking jobs with people who are much smarter than you, and then taking the time to help them with shit work, is almost as good a learning environment as a classroom.<p>I've bounced around a lot; but not since the first couple of jobs has anybody asked about my incomplete degree.  It's a results orientated business; I know that there are jobs that I won't be able to get -- and, to be honest, that I wouldn't be good at -- because of my lack of a formal CS education; but the jobs that I get, I work hard, learn new stuff, and <i>get shit done</i>.<p>But I've worked on really cool stuff, learnt <i>a lot</i> about digital video, started a company, and now am comfortably employed in a position where I can use the social and technical skills that I've developed to really make a difference.<p><i>EDIT</i>: One important thing you need to figure out is how you learn best.  Some people clone a github project and just learn Lambda Prolog by reading source; some peruse books; I've meet some wizardly hackers who seem to know every possible thing already.  As I said above, I need to talk about stuff to really get it to stick, but that's me.  Know how you learn and put yourself in a position to maximize your opportunity to learn, because everybody is dumber and less knowledgable than someone else.",1317589217

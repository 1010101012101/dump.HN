624748,comment,624685,624685,0,0,swombat,,,"Hey, if buying one ticket makes sense, then surely buying more than one ticket makes more sense. So you should spend all your $65m buying lottery tickets for the $49m jackpot lottery. If each $2 has an expected $3.50 return, then $65m's worth of tickets will have an expected $113m return! Bingo. Safe as houses.<p>Or perhaps this is an absurd argument, as proven by the above <i>reductio ad absurdum</i>, and you should keep your money to spend it on things that make sense.<p>But don't let me stop you. After all, the people who run the lottery need to eat too.",1243205630

The Edgar database at the SEC gives you the financials and relevant business information on every publicly-traded corporation in America.  The Congressional Record (and more user-friendly sites like govtrack.us) gives you the full record of everything that our legislators discuss.  API documentation and the source code gives you all the facts about most software libraries.  Many scientific academic journals give you just the facts on recent scientific discoveries.<p>How much time do you spend reading these, vs. time spent listening to mainstream media, blogs, forums, social bookmarking sites, and other opinion-based media?<p>Problem is, we're not wired to make sense of ""just the facts"" without overlaying some sort of interpretation on top of it.  Except for people with full-blown autism, facts themselves are generally quite boring.  They become meaningful only when we overlay some sort of story on top of them.  But coming up with stories that can explain a set of facts is mentally exhausting, so we'd very much like to outsource that to some other person.",1243205255

From my experiences i've formed the same conclusions and this is the reason I live alone, don't own a TV, and am currently trying to limit my use of the internet as much as possible (ironic I know considering i'm wasting my time here, but i'm getting better I swear!).<p>I'm starting to believe that any important intellectual truths have to be discovered for oneself, and that the only way to do this is to be alone with only your thoughts.",1243205169

I do get out more, but it's in SF.<p>I've had pretty fancy meals here and there in the peninsula and South Bay but the experience was that we paid a lot for well-plated tiny morsels. Never been to this Chez TJ but from the website I suspect it's something like that.<p>I used to live in Vancouver and there were far more options for interesting, delicious, satisfying food, and you didn't have to be a millionaire to afford it.

I've had <i>Indian</i> engineers recommend Amber India to me, which is sweetened de-spiced Indian cuisine, about as authentic as ""American"" Chinese food.<p>Of course I've had way better meals that Google's cafeterias.

624728,comment,619511,620065,0,0,simplesimon,,,"I've just been blown away reading this fantasic debate - thank you. I really hear netsp's point. I am the author and It makes me feel like apologising for being so judgemental.<p>I started out on this road as one of the ""people who do have a preference to live this way without any eco-political agendas"", at least not that I was consciously aware of. Then I think two main things happened.<p>1. I was subject to a positive feedback loop that goes roughly
- the more time I spent in nature
- the more I loved and understood it
- the more concern I had for ecological issues
- the more i wanted to live more harmoniously with nature
- the more inclination to workwith and care for the land
- the more time spent in nature
and so on<p>after some years seems i've inadvertently drifted into a position where i'm questionably become a radical and i definitely do have a concious eco-political agenda<p>2. I have experienced the resistance to the sort of thing we're doing. It simply goes against the status quo which there are many vested interests in preserving. So I see that whilst the construction industry is causing investment and in turn economic growth it must be preserved and expanded. Where it's business can be made more complex,there are new markets and room for growth. Then I see the industry satisfying the needs of growth and profit before its customers needs for shelter which could actually be achieved more effectively in simpler ways.<p>So if I sound critical or angry its the part of me that feels like people are being conned into expensive, unhealthy houses without being allowed or even told about the alternatives.<p>I am critical of conventional modern houses. I am NOT critical of people who live in them. I would like to be sure that they have the choice and that they understand the implications of their choice.<p>I am critical of modern construction techniques and of modern agriculture because they are not sustainable ie. they cannot continue to work in this way - this is a practical problem for us all regardless of whether or not it is a moral one. Finding systems to provide food and shelter for the long term are important problems that will require good design and judgement. I hope that in trying to practice and share good judgement of these systems I don't come across as judgemental of the people who use them.",1243203787

In JavaScript that is not really necessary since it will automatically create a variable in the global scope anyway.

But it should! One can check the number of elements before trying to get the 10'th one. Same with other comparisons: he wants to do `e.xxx == this`, but strict mode warns, because it might not exist. Well - that's what `if (e.xxx)` is for.<p>He mentions the only thing that might be useful is not implemented - warning when using a variable from a parent scope... except doing that is perfectly normal and valid.

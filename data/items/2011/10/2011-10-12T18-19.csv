3104017,comment,3102143,3102143,1,0,theitgirl,,,"I once considered suicide too. It was for a different reason. My boyfriend of 2 years told me he got engaged to a woman his parents picked. I had just graduated from college, had no job, was still living with my parents and had no plans for the future. I just got more and more depressed..stopped eating and pretty much cried all the time. My best friend told me to ""stop being a loser"". My mom kept saying ""why are you doing this to us?"". Well, I felt like a loser and a burden to society...really, I would be doing a favor to everyone if I just disappeared.<p>Then one day I did try to commit suicide by slitting my wrists. It didn't quite work out. It wasn't as easy as they show in the movies :). Then I had a realization. I was looking for some external factor to make me feel better...my mom, my friends, etc. and I was very self-pitiful. I realized that if I wanted to get out of my situation, only I can do something about it.<p>I let go of the past and started over. I got a paid internship..moved out of my parents house and concentrated on just being self-sustaining. I made new friends and tried to be as social as possible...being around happy people rubs of on you :)<p>I feel like you are still in the phase where you are going over your past and keep thinking that you should have done something different. You have to stop thinking about the past. Hopefully, saying it out loud here helped you a little with that. I would suggest you to concentrate on the present. Take small steps. Do one thing each day to improve your situation.<p>A few more tips that helped me deal with my depression:
- Write out your feelings like you did now
- Try your best not be alone. Either go to the library or a coffee shop to do job applications or other work.
- Don't take your friends and your dad too seriously. Most people do not know how to deal with a depressed person. They usually say the exact wrong thing :)<p>Best of luck!",1318445813

3104013,comment,3103125,3103125,5,0,MostAwesomeDude,,,"Since we've already descended into anecdotal territory, lemme drop an anecdote. I had a dot-product function which turned out to be a hotspot in some numerical code. The original function looked something like:<p><pre><code>    def dot(v1, v2):
        return sum(i * j for i, j in zip(v1, v2))
</code></pre>
Very functional, very pretty, very straightforward. But it was slow, both in CPython and PyPy. A bit of bytecode analysis and profiling later, we realized that unrolling would be faster by several orders of magnitude. So I checked this in:<p><pre><code>    def dot2(u, v):
        return u[0] * v[0] + u[1] * v[1]
    def dot3(u, v):
        return u[0] * v[0] + u[1] * v[1] + u[2] * v[2]

Today it becomes device agnostic. The blog post that janaboruta added goes into detail on what's changed.<p>To answer your other questions, I can only answer with my opinion. Obviously I've used some mobile backend platforms and I believe that they offer features beyond the trivial store and retrieval case. The obvious and biggest feature that comes to mind is supporting push notifications out of the box.<p>But there are a few more that at least StackMob provides, such as the ability to version your API out of the box, run multiple versions concurrently, have a sandbox environment in which to develop, have the option to extend the platform with your own code, and have good analytics for your app. We're always adding new features too.<p>As an Android & iOS developer before I worked at StackMob, I generally had to do some work to implement all of those things. We're aiming to build these things well so that any mobile engineer can use them and focus on building a great app instead of a great backend.<p>Hope that helps.",1318445645

They are popular because they make a tradeoff between development speed and execution speed. Better hardware may change that tradeoff slightly, but human labor will likely still be more expensive than the servers running the applications, so this changes nothing.<p>I don't think Java will disappear from the web any time soon.

You're not an idiot for leaving an abusive employer; you would have been an idiot to stay there. I bet that in a few years, you <i>will</i> remember it as one of the best things you've ever done. It just doesn't feel that way right now, because quitting is only the first step you have to take to make things better.<p>It's not that easy to find a decent job, especially in this economy... so if all else fails, you will have to ""bootstrap"" yourself, get any old job (as others already pointed out), and buy yourself some time to figure out what you really want.<p>Parents can be notoriously annoying when it comes to things like this, but (in my experience) it's <i>usually</i> because they're worried. They only see part of the story; you had a (well-paying) job, then you quit, now you're broke, doesn't sound like a good decision, from their POV. When I lost my job long ago, my mom acted like it was the end of the world. (It's better than having a parent who doesn't care though.) But after a few months I found a job that was what I <i>wanted</i> to do (i.e., programming, in my case) and things got better from there.<p>A final thought: it's better to make this decision when you're 20, than when you're (say) 40 and have a mortgage, a family to support, etc.<p>Good luck.",1318444672

I wrote a direct-mail letter and purchased a mailing list of artists and over time sent the promo pieces out with a special discount code to sign up online.  Some artists are very non-techy (especially going back to early 2000s), I even toyed with the idea of having a mail-in form to setup the website.<p>Probably our best marketing has been our free daily art marketing newsletter and blog (<a href=""http://faso.com/fineartviews/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://faso.com/fineartviews/</a>).  Our daily email list is over 15,000 and growing and we regularly promote to those artists.  I think this is a strategy FAR too many startups ignore.  We don't spend most of our time writing articles for other startups, we write articles that are of interest to our CUSTOMERS.  That keeps them coming back to our site day after day.<p>Also - PARTNER with other companies.  The gist of my marketing advice is this:  Ask yourself, ""Who else reaches the same customers I do?""  Now partner with those people.  For example, we host an online art contest for an art supply company.

Oh, and the new phone is shipping this week [thanks, smackfu], including its Siri service that relies on a server-side component. And iTunes 10.5 yesterday. And the white iPod touch. OK, I'll stop now.<p>Just might be a stressful time to be an Apple employee.<p>I remember it being reported that in the Jobs-Makes-Everybody-Cry-After-MobileMe-Launch-Disaster meeting that he said that one of the major mistakes they made was releasing too much at once - that they should've let MobileMe simmer a while more instead of tying it to the iPhone 3GS launch. Guess we'll see what happens this time. Hard to transition your whole software stack to being integrated with a new cloud service without doing most of these updates at once, I suppose, but they <i>could</i> have shipped the software then waited a month and shipped the phone. Would've been contrary to the ""integrated"" hardware/software messages that Apple usually has, though.<p>edit: All in the shadow of a homepage that has nothing but a memorial to Jobs. Classy. And, if they pull it off, should give a nice confidence boost that such feats can be done even in the new era.",1318443509

What I meant was that while the WinRT environment is horrible to use on a touchless desktop environment (for me, at least), Windows 8 can easily be changed to feel almost exactly like Windows 7 (which I can use very efficiently).<p>At the same time, whenever I have a touch-based device I can still make use of all the WinRT features.<p>Long story short, Windows 8 may look like a UI disaster at first, but for devs at least it's almost irrelevant because you can change pretty much everything, and get used to or ignore the rest.<p>Like I said earlier though, I'm not sure how much reconfiguration the mainstream user wants to do, or how easily they'll get used to WinRT.",1343854228

Knowing that I'm accountable for my decisions makes me much more likely to make positive choices. For example, I've been trying to cut back on coffee. Knowing that I drink 1.2 or 0.8 coffees per day has far less of an impact on me than knowing that at the end of the day I'm going to have to go in and check ""Yes"" next to my coffee item. It sounds ridiculous, but it works.<p>Sebastian Marshall has written extensively about life tracking, which is how I originally got into it.

This doesn't mean you should take it as an opportunity to vent and say horrible things just because you can, but you should be honest.

So, I find its helpful to think of algorithms in terms of transformations of data rather than series of instructions.<p>For example, what values do I start with, and are they in (unordered) sets, (ordered) sequences, or something more intricate? Then, what do I want to end up with?<p>Now, how can I get from one to the other via a series of transformations or combinations of the data? Am I turning one set/sequence/whatever into another, operating on the individual elements? If so, thats probably some sort of map operation. Am I combining element of a sequence somehow? If Ive already got a sequence, thats probably a reduce or something like it. But what if Ive only got an unordered set? Then maybe I need to impose some ordering first. Can that order be arbitrary, or is there really some implicit order that gets me to working with a well-defined sequence? Maybe I need to combine multiple sequences somehow. If each element in one sequence corresponds to a single element in the other, thats probably some sort of zip operation. If its a many-to-many matching, that might be some sort of nested recursive algorithm that walks each sequence one inside the other, or maybe I can generate an outer product so Ive got a one-dimensional list of all possible pairs and then do something simpler with that.<p>After a while, you get to recognise basic underlying data structures like sets, sequences, and trees, and you get to recognise which common operations make sense for each type. You can map just about anything, but to reduce you need a sequence. You can make a sequence from a set by imposing an arbitrary order if necessary. You can make a sequence from a tree in several ways, for example by traversing it in depth-first or breadth-first. And so on.<p>Sometimes youll need to do something that isnt a convenient, ready-made transformation like a filter or zip, and at that point you start thinking about using recursion to traverse the relevant data structure(s) manually. Once youve done that a few times, you might start to see new kinds of recurring logic within your code, which you can abstract away into their own higher order functions to join the standard toolbox next to fold and friends.<p>You <i>can</i> get into all kinds of fun and games with representing effects and controlling the interactions between them as well. However, Id suggest that if you can start to think of simple problems in terms of things like transforming and combining structured data and then move on to implementing more advanced algorithms by combining the simpler building blocks, thats probably the best way to get your feet wet without getting out your depth in the early days.",1343853321

In fact, I would argue that storing your content within a page's HTML structure while separating content and functionality is exceedingly difficult, and that if you want to maintain that separation of concerns, you need to store your data in a totally separate format, and then write code that generates the HTML structure based on that format.<p>Then, taking that HTML and enhancing it with JavaScript (aka progressive enhancement) is <i>also</i> a violation of separation of concerns, and I would argue against it in any but the very simplest of cases. Instead, you should use JavaScript to operate on the raw data and display it to the user.

They offer a platform for others to build on, because it raises the value of their company by making it more pervasive.  They also build their own products on top of their platform.  \nWhich takes precedence over the other?

It's easy and takes little investment.  However, building a REAL product on the platform is a risk.

A more structured web app would be doing much more with the error depending on the situation. I'm glad that the code to handle those errors would be right around the logical point it should be: where I'm performing the action.<p>Many of the handlers have some boiler plate error checking on some actions that could fail. I agree those lines of code are repetitive and aesthetically displeasing, but as I alluded to in the article, a more filled in app could define a handler type that returns an error instead of being expected it to handle it within. The http.Error calls would change to returns, but that's a good thing: a quick scan allows me to see when the function can return to the caller. I don't have to inspect every line of code and remember details about which calls throw exceptions or not.

My experience is violent responses tend to affect your judgement for a longer time period after. On the other hand, lying also has a similar effect, although milder. I've come to the conclusion, it's a very hard thing to balance, and easy to over-do for me.<p>I have lied in a previous exit interview, saying am going for a higher education. while that was true, that was hardly the reason for me leaving. And it still annoys me i did that. I would rather have said, i don't think the management practices make sense, and i haven't been able to change/modify a single bit of it in the last 3 years. So, am better off somewhere else. \nInfact, both companies after that did not have exit interview per se, so i never got around to saying stuff, but sometimes think i should have. But i would be happy to do something like i mentioned above with my current company when i leave.",1343852542

For example, each day I track things related to my health such as whether or not I exercised or ran, what I ate for each meal, and whether or not I stretched at some point during the day. I also track things related to the products I'm working on such as marketing activities, a summary of what I accomplished that day and what my objectives are tomorrow.<p>Unlike most other life tracking tools, this system is meant to be used once at the end of each day and should take no more than a few minutes to complete. Not only do you benefit from the analysis of your daily reports, but you also benefit just by making them because it forces you to be accountable for what you're doing each day. I highly recommend trying it, if only for a week or two to see whether or not it helps in your life.<p>My goal from the start was to build and launch this in four weeks of nights and weekends effort; today is exactly four weeks so I'm launching despite one or two rough edges. I'm very open to feedback so if there's anything you'd like me to add or change just let me know.<p>Thanks for checking it out. -- Matt",1343851932

By setting up a method to access your application via the network means you have opened a potential security hole on the device.  A port is opened and listening which means different types of attacks can take place given this port being opened.  HTTPS doesn't secure a potential buffer overflow attack on your open port. In addition your back-end server can be attacked as well with people gaining access to data you have collected. Mobile devices are not well known for setting up firewalls and these are reactive defenses at best.<p>Switchboard is a great idea and again it is great that you have opened sourced the code.<p>With regards to manipulating the code.

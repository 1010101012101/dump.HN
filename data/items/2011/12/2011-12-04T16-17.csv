It is mostly a matter of whom you pay, not if.  Taxes exist to cover the costs of governing the people, providing infrastructure and services for the citizens and so on.  Even if you can get unplugged from existing governments, someone has to pay for the infrastructure of the seastead and essential services.  You can give it a different name, but charging your people to help pay these costs is basically the same thing as taxes.  Not charging your people to help pay these costs would mean eventually sinking to the bottom of the ocean.  These costs are likely to be relatively high, higher than what it takes to maintain roads and sewage and the like on land.<p><i>Unless a seastead were the size of Manhattan its citizens would have to forgo the cultural life, the parks and the wide choice of shopping and restaurants offered by large cities.</i><p>They might have to forego a lot of that anyway.  I briefly considered applying for a job in Hawaii and I asked around regarding things like food in Hawaii (because I have special dietary needs). I was told basically that spam is a staple food, good luck getting meat and milk on a consistent/reliable basis as it sometimes isn't very available, things get flown in from far away so a lot of it is frozen not fresh, and what is available is quite pricey.  There is plenty of sea food available, but I am allergic to shell fish and don't tolerate large quantities of fish well. In fact, I rarely eat fish.<p>A few years ago, I stayed in Port Aransas, Texas for a few days. I loved the place and have toyed with the idea of going back (as in living there).  But I struggled to feed myself while there.  There is a great deal of sea food and some very expensive restaurants and some real dives and a very limited grocery store.  Given my dietary restrictions, these details made it a daily challenge to try to eat properly for my needs and I don't feel it really did an adequate job.<p>So if an island a short drive off the coast of Texas has challenges in offering ""a wide choice of restaurants"" and Hawaii has challenges with making sure food (in terms of variety and affordability) is consistently available, what on earth makes them think a floating platform will do better merely based on population size?",1323017475

3311012,comment,3310355,3310755,4,0,DanielBMarkham,,,"What you are missing is the inherently multi-disciplinary nature of programming. People who develop deep technology solutions by necessity have to get a crash course in whatever business system they are automating and improving. If you spend 15 years working on various projects, you have not only stayed current with a shifting base of state-of-the-art tech, you've also been exposed to critical parts of operations and learned what the issues, risks, and drivers are. You don't get that in the EMT world, or the brain surgery world, or the nuclear physics world. In those worlds, you have a single industry and set of problems that you live inside for your entire career.<p>There's also a huge bedrock of many business-related disciplines that don't change. Want to be a manager? I can throw out every book written in the last 20 years and still sit down and put together a damn effective course in management. Want to learn accounting? While GAAP has changed, many accounting systems are still using the double-entry ledger system that was in place in Dickens' time. The business practices of running an A/R system now is going to look very much the same as running that kind of business did in 1980.<p>Yes, it's true that great performers in any field will naturally pick up a bunch of things in other fields, but these are mostly peripheral to their job, not a critical part of it. Pilots may learn a bit about how radios work, but it's not the same thing as spending two years writing software radio code. Technology development is unlike any other field of endeavor because it is a meta-discpline: it encompasses all other disciplines. Everything you do in life, including being an EMT, is being assisted by technologists somewhere. Programming and technology development is the bedrock of every other kind of activity. Good technologists are not only experts in one area, they are experts in learning new areas. This is one of the reasons why Google is involved is so many things and so many other companies are not. You have a breadth of capability with 40,000 generic engineers that you simply wouldn't have with 40,000 rocket scientists, fishermen, or history majors.",1323017397

It's bad <i>because</i> of the privacy invasion (and all the negatives that come with that).  Oversight of wiretapping is not bad, because it is not an invasion of privacy unless you believe that warrantless wiretapping is a private matter.  Such oversight enhances privacy.<p>2) You've said that they should stop funding such agencies.  That's not a partial dissolution.  Also, removing the head of an agency still has the same issue.  It's rarely the best action.  Agencies with constantly-shifting heads are less effective due to constant priority and strategy changes.<p>And this isn't just an issue of budget.  It's not uncommon to forbid agencies from doing illegal things or things outside their jurisdiction.<p>3) If it's legal to suppress privacy, the government would do it on a regular basis and this would make society less efficient and more likely to end up with authoritarian government.<p>The government owning everyone's secrets gives them additional power and control.  It has many potential abuses.<p>I'm trying to get you to actually think about what you're saying.  The arguments you have about freedom of speech largely apply to privacy.  By the arguments you've applied to wiretapping, we don't need oversight into freedom of speech abuses.  Why pass strict laws protecting speech?  Why worry about the ""gray area"" abuses?  Why not allow the government to engage in widespread speech suppression if it makes them more effective?<p>Why does speech deserve such attention, except that you happen to believe that it's important for society (which I happen to agree with, but which you've provided no meaningful support for)?<p>4) A 1% false positive rate might be acceptable for spam, where the loss is simply an email, and the fix is simply to scan the spam folder.  A 1% false positive is not an acceptable rate for wiretap-driven arrests, because these are humans, and the fix is a long and complex legal process.<p>5) Speech is not important only in comparison to more important issues, such as freedom from false arrest.  Of course speech has some value and deserves some protection.  But it is already protected well enough and not a major concern at this moment.<p>We're apparently not going to agree on whether privacy is important.  What I find more bizarre is that you swing back and forth between privacy being important and not.  You've made numerous statements in support of unfettered wiretaps.  I feel like you actually do not believe what you're saying, or that perhaps you haven't thought it through very well.",1323016337

There are a mountain of hurdles to cross before you get to any kind of autonomous ""state"". Still, I hope someone tries it. Some casual observations:<p>* Would this be Bitcoins first big opportunity? For a Seastead to make the leap to true statehood, they'll need some kind of currency that isn't controlled by a foreign government. Bitcoin, with it's entirely decentralized design, would seem to fit the bill.<p>* The artricle makes some statements that these Seasteads could be used to prove the utopian Libertarian ideology. The notion that a small colony of a few hundred people are going to prove that <i>any</i> ideology would work in a state the size of the US, France, U.K., etc is patently absurd. They'll ignore it, dismiss it, or find good reasons why mechanisms that work on a micro scale don't scale to larger nations.<p>* The article talks a lot about the need to be outside the jurisdiction of large nations like the US, and even mentions the willingness of the US to extend its jurisdiction pretty much anywhere in the world. The author seems to believe that if they stay away from the big-naughties, they'll be ok. I think he's wrong. If enough large corporations do the math and find that moving to an off-shore platform is a positive value proposition when compared to continuing to pay taxes, large, tax-dependent governments will find ways to replace the revenue. So you want statehood? You got it. Time to negotiate a trade agreement. How does a 60% tariff on all goods imported to our nation sound? Don't want to play ball? Embargo. Good luck with your 700 person economy.<p>* The last thing that strikes me is the monumental risk associated with building your entire nation on something that can sink. Literally. Say this idea eventually scales to $10,000 people. What is an acceptable level of safety for an entire population of that size? Lifeboats for everyone? Will the platform be sold as ""unsinkable""? We know how that goes. Even land-based settlements face the risk of natural disaster, but it would seem the probabilities are greatly in favor of dry land.",1323016178

Remember, Google is not a browser maker (well, technically it is I guess), its focus is on search. Chrome is the unofficial child of Googlebot and the reason it exists is to help them dominate search. It wouldn't make sense for Google not to renew with Mozilla because that would be a gift to Miscrosoft's Bing.<p>As far as bloat goes, well addons account for a lot of bad performance and we have to remember that Firefox is old and there are people who have been using it for ages. Those people are carrying a lot of baggage in the form of old browser profiles, the user database, maybe even years worth of cookies and history. Setting up a totally fresh Firefox install would speed things up for many.<p>But I can't be a Mozilla apologist. I switched to Chrome but use FF for testing.

3310918,comment,3310649,3310649,1,0,billpatrianakos,,,"All day... At least that's how it seems. I often work a 12 hour day but not all that time is actually spent writing code. Like others have said, being in the right frame of mind is key. Coding isn't like other things where you just have to force yourself and practice. When you code and you're not in ""the zone"" it often feels like you never sat down to write code at all.<p>That said, there are times you will have to force yourself anyway. As a beginner I would tackle a project you think is really interesting and work on it until it turns out as you'd imagined. Copying things others have already done is a great way to learn if you don't cheat and just copy/paste their code and call it yours.",1323014966

I love coding because it's a medium for me to create something tangible out of nothing. I loved it before I was paid to do it for a living, and I'll love it till I become senile (the plan is to write lolcode when that day finally comes).<p>That said, I love other things in life as well - friends, family, girlfriend. All these loves are first class citizens and I can't tradeoff on one for another. When forced to choose, I always find a way to compromise. For example, when my girlfriend started grad school, I started working with Intridea (an all remote web and mobile consultancy).<p>I constantly in the process of finding ways to allow me to code what I want to, and still make money. I like to think of it as a daily and incremental refactoring of my life.",1323014924

I have a theory that Scrum primarily works because of this.  Just have daily Scrum-light meetings with your group.   If you have 15 minutes with a group of 5-6 people and everyone has to say either ""done"" or ""not done""... the not dones will of course have some silly excuse, but because of the time constraint you must cut them off, be curt, and say to the effect ""so John can you help Dan with that right after we break?"".  And then everyone would make commitments on to what they would do that day.  I guess in a way you can say this was being a drill sergeant, but the thing was I wasn't an a-hole, that 15 minute meeting every morning was just part of the process, it was expected.<p>After a few weeks of this everything moves at twice the speed.  I had a team of 6 devs (including myself) burn through nearly 200 bugs in 2 months.  That's every engineer fixing about 4 bugs a day.  There was a hug chasm of talents on that team... we had the top guy in my dept as well as one of the weakest engineers on the same team.  Everyone performed.",1323014638

I assumed that a company would rather contribute to a BSD'd project than a GPL'd project on these grounds.<p>It recently occurred to me, though, that some companies may prefer to contribute to GPL'd projects over BSD'd ones. When Red Hat contributes to the Linux kernel, they know that their competitors will not be able to create a derivative without also releasing it under the GPL. Red Hat's competitors can't create proprietary derivatives that would compete with Red Hat so, in essence, it's safer for a company to contribute to a GPL'd project than a BSD'd project.<p>This is a really interesting and non-obvious property of the GPL that I never see mentioned.",1323014526

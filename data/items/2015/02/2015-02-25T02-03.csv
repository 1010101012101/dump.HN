Having a few questions in mind is always a good idea, though I tend to prefer discussion starters rather than a simple, straightforward question. It gives you the opportunity of a follow-up, which let&#x27;s you talk about a topic of _your_ choosing. My usual rule of thumb for end-of-interview discussions is that it should last until the interviewer suddenly realizes time&#x27;s up. Then you know that they really enjoyed the conversation.<p>In general though, I&#x27;d avoid HR-related questions. They are almost always likely to generate a generic response, almost every candidate will ask similar questions, and they can easily be answered by your HR department contact.",1424832985

As an outsider, you are at many disadvantages: you don&#x27;t know the culture, you don&#x27;t know how things get done, you don&#x27;t know who to talk to and who will waste your time, and so on. So to get in, not only are you fighting against all of these obstacles, but you also have to perform at the level which is expected of everyone, which might be higher than what you&#x27;re used to.<p>This means that the odds of getting in on your first try are quite, quite low. If your goal is really to make it there, you have to treat it as a numbers game - after 5, 10, 20 tries, you&#x27;ll probably get in. Or maybe if your dream is to work at Google/Facebook/etc., then the best way to do it is to first start working for a smaller, lesser known company that&#x27;s having a harder time hiring. Make yourself a name there, volunteer to give some talks, post some open source projects that&#x27;ll bring your name at the top of Hacker News for a day, and after a couple of years, knock again at the door of your dream company. Or maybe they&#x27;ll end up knocking at your door again very soon. Recruiters know very well that the number of false negatives is quite high, and that people can change very fast.<p>If you want to take part, you have to put in a lot of effort and personal work, and expect things to take time- you have to stay humble, and you have to keep pushing.

Given the comparative popularity of the two, it seems statistically likely that most people actually wanted a 323i. Having said that, I note that Google doesn&#x27;t show 323i results for 723i, so... hm.<p>I do think explaining the substitution that was done and linking to the exact search (ie, how Google does it) would be a good feature though.",1424830370

9104889,comment,9092545,9104208,0,0,cpks,,,"Two ways to look at it:<p>1. Return on investment. Every hour spent on applied math generates a lot more applications (not to mention elegant mathematics) than the same spent on theoretical math. Theoretical math has about as much value as knitting and crochet. Does someone occasionally come up with something of value? Sure. Does it have more value than any other hobby? Not really.<p>2. With encryption in particular, Diffie-Hellmen is simple enough that public key would have been created regardless of research in theoretical math. Furthermore, most of the people developing such (including Diffie, Hellmen, Merkle, Rivest, Shamir, Adleman, etc.) have applied backgrounds. Indeed, most are computer scientists, rather than mathematicians. The same goes for cryptographic protocols, doubly so. Symmetric encryption, in contrast, does build a <i>little</i> bit on theoretical math, but it&#x27;s also just an arms race. More knowledge about number theory helps both cryptography and cryptanalysis about equally. There&#x27;s no reason to believe that more number theory makes us in any way more secure. Cryptography itself would exist without number theory (indeed, history is a bit fuzzy as to whether something like the scytale or number theory came first, and regardless, there is no reason to believe one fed the other).",1424830150

That is, rather than me verifying that key 0xDEADBEEF belongs to the individual known to the town council of Lower Shroppington as &#x27;William Morris&#x27; (which is inherently fragile: I may not be an expert at verifying identity documents, or at verifying those issued by Lower Shroppington; the individual before me might have a document issued by Lower Shroppington deliberately to mislead me; heck, who <i>is</i> the real William Morris: there could be more than one), I would just verify that this is the individual <i>I</i> call William Morris, and let you make use of that as you may.  If Lower Shroppington wanted to, they could issue a certificate stating that they call him William Morris too.<p>It was a really smart way of doing things.<p>How might it fit into a modern email infrastructure?  Easy!  example.com could use key 0xBADDA451 use certify that foo@example.com belongs to the keyholder of the key 0xC0FFEEBA; .com could use key 0xFEEDBAC7 to certify that example.com belongs to 0xBADDA451; the root domain could use key 0x55378008 to certify that .com belongs to 0xFEEDBAC7; IANA could certify the ownership of the root domain; the ICANN board could certify the current IANA key; the previous ICANN board could certify the current ICANN board, and so forth.<p>What would you see in Outlook or Gmail?  Your agent would display that the claimed sender email is valid.  It might also try to find some path connecting you & good ol&#x27; Bill Morris, then show you that your buddy Steve&#x27;s ex girlfriend Wilhelmina says that key belongs to Billy Morris.<p>Interestingly, this could even work for an email legitimately sent on William&#x27;s behalf.  All a normal user would care about is, &#x27;this email is legit&#x27; (for some value of); us geeks could geek out as we wished.",1424829669

They project the image for the current layer up through the membrane and the dead zone, so the build layer is actually within the tank.

9216295,comment,9215890,9216046,0,0,iamwil,,,"You are. Using UV to cure photo-sensitive resin isn&#x27;t the innovation, it&#x27;s using the oxygen permeable membrane.<p>If you look at the Form 1 printer or the B9Creator, there&#x27;s a mechanical step between every layer where it needs to actuate the platform in order to loosen the resin from the projection window, so it can build the next layer. In the Form 1, it peels the print off, and the B9Creator slides a window. (look for videos on youtube.)<p>In both instances, the amount of time spent actuating the mechanical part adds up, and results in a significant amount of time spent in the print actuating the plate. What the oxygen membrane allows us to do is to skip that step between every layer, and simply keep shining a continuous changing image slice of the object as we&#x27;re pulling the object out of the resin.<p>Not only does this have the advantage of speeding up prints by orders of magnitude, in materials, the grain of the object influences the type of thing you can built. If you print a stress holding object with the grain orientated in the wrong direction, the part will fail very readily. This way, we have greater design freedom, without worrying about grain direction.",1426566647

Why is it easier than, say, Ruby<p>>Once people pick up PHP, then they usually start exploring other languages..<p>But since they are already brainwashed from PHP use, it prevents them from seeing the value of doing thing the proper way, and might see the process as contrived. This is the most dangerous aspect of using PHP. It blocks your learning and understanding. It pulls you down and keep it there.<p>A good example is the use of PHP arrays. It is a combination of different data structures like list, dictionaries, sets etc. But because it is a combination, you wont be able to use it as a list, or a dictionary or as a set to the fullest extent. And you will be so used to using this for every situation that you might be put off by lack of similar data structures in other languages, and blocks you from seeing the value of using the right one for a particular situation.<p>So I request every one who is passionate about programming and wants a career in programming to keep away from the php language and community as much as possible.",1426566628

With 2 billion people connected to the Internet, meeting people online with similar interests should totally be easier\n2.) The social taboo against making friends online is outdated \n3.) Chatrooms allow people to connect with others in a way that’s not possible through content-driven sites like Facebook or Twitter.<p>Facebook, Twitter, and Reddit are driven mostly by user-generated content. Users post things like statuses, photos, and comments – social interaction is then derived from this activity.<p>However, we think that there is too much emphasis on content rather than on the social interaction behind it. A karma system encourages this – the “like” or “upvote” functions have effectively turned the act of posting into a popularity contest, since the people who accrue the most amount of likes or upvotes are the ones deemed as popular. This leaves little room for actually building relationships.<p>So what does it mean to be “social” on the internet? Is being social on the internet even a desirable thing? We think that being social on the internet means exactly the same as it’d mean in real life – making new friends and keeping up with the friends you already have.

Do you see the error?<p>Even if one of the hypotheses you arrive at after torture ends up giving you enough to go on, to eventually acquire more information by other means and arrive at the truth, it could have happened any of the following ways:<p>* The subject simply guessed, and happened to be right.<p>* The subject gave you information you already knew, but hadn&#x27;t followed up yet. This information was passed to the subject during the torture, either deliberately or through unconscious bias.<p>* The subject had some actionable information, and torture compelled him to give it to you.<p>For the most part you, as the torturer, will have no way of knowing which of these it happened to be. In the first two cases, you are dumber after the torture session than before it. In the third case, you are smarter after the torture session, but not as smart as you could have been.<p>If it was the first case, you would have been better off guessing at a hypotheses yourself and following that up, than soliciting the subject via torture to provide you several hypotheses of his own. You, as the torturer, are not yourself being tortured, and are probably in a clearer state of mind and better able to guess an hypotheses that might be useful.<p>If it&#x27;s the second, the subject is only giving you information you already knew, but he&#x27;s also giving you a bunch of specious information that you&#x27;re going to waste time following up. You&#x27;re worse off than before you tortured the subject.<p>For the third, congratulations! You have successfully extracted some true information from a subject via the method of torture. You won&#x27;t know for sure at the time, of course, so you&#x27;ll have to go to extra lengths to be sure of the information, and you&#x27;re still likely to have acquired some specious information <i>in addition to</i> the truth. So you&#x27;ll still waste time following up those leads like in case 2. But you did achieve some small victory. Since in the case where the subject does actually know something you want, there are also provably more reliable ways of getting it than torture, you have still created extra work for yourself, but you&#x27;ll still be able to put on your report that torture &#x27;worked&#x27;.

The occasional need for logic can be satisfied by string interpolation to run a programmable expression. Which is exactly what the old crop of templating languages have been doing.<p>However, this paradigm doesn&#x27;t suit web-apps. A web-site can be thought of as a programmatically <i>enhanced</i> view, but a web-app is a programmatically <i>constructed</i> view. Construction calls for abstractions. We can either port back programming abstractions in the form of helpers and directives into templates, giving rise to innumerable templating languages with custom syntax and innumerable quirks (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_web_template_engines"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_web_template_engi...</a>), or we could simply use code, the best tool for the job.<p>This is exactly what JSX does: it enhances code to be able to parse XML views, which helps us write well-organized front-end code with all the abstractions that only a programming language can provide.",1426564934

One of our issues with the virtual stuff is when we started dedicating them to a set VLAN, multiple times we ran into an issue where some type of resource for that pod the VLAN was in would be maxed out (usually storage) so we couldn&#x27;t create a new instance. The solution we were given was to let the system pick a VLAN but by doing that we had lost control of the placement and added some complexity to our architecture.<p>Aside from that it was mainly nit-picky type stuff, but still things that were annoying (networking issues between DCs, networking issues between pods, internal mirrored apt-get repos going out of sync, API is kind of blah, etc).<p>We use docker so having a few bare metal machines with tons of containers on them wasn&#x27;t a great HA setup (for us at least), even running in two data centers. The fairly quick setup time though was a nice selling point.<p>When we went to AWS things just kind of worked. The API was easier to use and the GUI portal was way nicer/stable. So far we have not had any odd issues with our instances, but we also typically run them at about 50% capacity so that might be why. It is also still early so maybe things will come up in 6+ months that send us back to SL :)",1426564922

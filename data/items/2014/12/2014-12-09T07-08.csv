I think it would be tough to reach a fast speed since your joints would need to oscillate rapidly in order to push off ground moving as fast. And each time you push off the ground you&#x27;d achieve less force, due to the friction thing. To summarize, I think I agree with you that humans will run more slowly in a low-gravity environment.<p>An interesting parallel question is: under 1.3, 1.5, or 2x gravity, how much more quickly could you run? And what&#x27;s the optimal gravity for running if it&#x27;s not 1.0 Earth?",1418111515

money for, health will always be at the top of the list, since without
good health, you suffer from a constant impediment. Unfortunately,
providing solutions to health problems is probably well beyond scope for
already struggling startups.<p>PG asked, &quot;What do you need that you&#x27;d pay a lot for?&quot; in relation to
changing sales discussions with the hope of bringing in some revenue for
struggling startups. The problem with taking this a bit too literally is
it&#x27;s essentially the same thing as asking a customer what they want. The
classic statement from Henry Ford is, &quot;If I asked my customers what they
wanted, they&#x27;d tell me a faster horse.&quot; Often, the customer may not know
what they want.<p>Instead of asking &quot;What you&#x27;d pay a lot for?&quot; you could ask &quot;Where are
you spending lots?&quot; or &quot;What costs you a lot?&quot; One of my favorites is,

8721568,comment,8721379,8721379,0,0,raquo,,,"I have three windsport-related ideas for you.<p>1) weather analysis<p>I&#x27;m a hang glider pilot, but this applies to all wind sports – windsurfing, kiteboarding, paragliding, sailplanes, possibly even surfing and skydiving.<p>These sports require weather analysis. Is the wind blowing from the right direction? Is the cloudbase high enough?<p>Some weather analysis tools exist like <a href=""http://www.xcskies.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.xcskies.com/</a> for hang gliding and paragliding, but they&#x27;re not perfect to say the least.<p>I still spend too much time looking at various charts and forecasts in the summer, and then waiting on site once I arrive and the weather conditions aren&#x27;t right. If you can make me wait less on my precious weekend time, you have my money.<p>Participants of these sports pretty much accept the current level of technology to be as good as it gets, because there are very few meteorologists who could create new, better weather models, and at the same time be either interested in doing that for free or have the technical and business acumen to make it a business. So pretty much everyone uses the RASP model and weather data off many disparate websites.<p>---<p>2) flight instruments<p>Hang gliders, paragliders and sailpane pilots use special devices that combine a variometer with GPS and some stored map data to record flight paths, show airspeed, descent rate, etc. These are small, like a fat iPhone 6+ with a calculator-style screen.<p>The company producing the most popular ones is Flytec. I&#x27;m not sure how they get away with selling a simple device that runs on two AA batteries for $400-$1000. Maybe they have some key patents... though they are not a monopolist, there&#x27;s FlyMaster for example. Flytec&#x27;s devices are pretty much the same as those they were selling 10 years ago, they are cheap to make and should not cost that much.<p>There&#x27;s room in the market for a significantly cheaper and/or more magical device. By magical I mean stuff like &quot;go this way to get into the lifting air you&#x27;ve just lost&quot;, or &quot;fly faster/slower to maximize glide ratio&quot;.<p>---<p>3) weather mapping drone<p>When the wind hits the mountain / ridge at a certain angle, hang gliders, paragliders and sailplanes can easily soar next to that mountain. The wind also needs to be in a certain speed range etc.<p>Sometime we pilots want to check if that mountain over there could be flyable. It looks like it might be soarable, but to verify this, we need to drive up the mountain and launch a live person in a glider from there. That&#x27;s a huge waste of time, and because often such roads are privately owned, there&#x27;s a lot of hassle in getting permission to do that. Landowners are afraid of the liability (which we legally waive but it takes time to explain and verify), and we don&#x27;t even know if the mountain is soarable at all, we can only guess.<p>It would be nice if we could just launch a drone which would fly around and record wind direction and speeds at various locations and altitudes.<p>The same technique could also be used to better understand existing flying sites, OR to find thermals (invisible pockets of uprising air which gliders need to stay up in the air for long period of time). And this is #1 thing we want – more found thermals, more airtime.<p>So maybe it can be a sort of follow-drone that flies in your general area, telling you where the thermals are. You can tell you&#x27;re in a thermal once you actually fly into it, but you&#x27;re descending at 3 ft per second, so the amount of time you can fly searching for thermals is limited.<p>Because you&#x27;re flying a glider, the follow-drone can be a glider too with just a small auxiliary engine, you don&#x27;t need too much battery power.<p>---<p>So there you have it. Wind sports are technologically underserved because the market size isn&#x27;t very big, but the pain is real, and it&#x27;s #1 reason preventing more people from participating. Maybe some of the weather / hardware solutions you develop might also be applicable in other fields. Maybe you already have a solution that is fairly easily adjustable to wind sports (esp. drones).",1418111477

I don&#x27;t know what is so horrific about the semantics though, they are pretty straightforward. A Makefile is a set of rules, each rule being a target file, its dependencies, and the recipe to turn the dependencies into the target. Make can figure out which steps need to actually run based on the states of the targets and dependencies (prereqs in Make terms). It&#x27;s a really powerful way to describe the relationships and transformation steps for files, and you get partial builds for free!

They operate call centers here and abroad that route calls to contractors in the field, who are usually working (at least in the US) here illegally on tourist visas, and they charge several hundred dollars above market price to perform unlocks, and much more to sell and install counterfeit lock hardware, none of which their workforce is remotely qualified to actually carry out.  Unless you know the locksmith, or know their shop, or can find a locksmith affiliated with ALOA, or use your insurance company&#x27;s (example:  AAA) list of approved locksmiths, it&#x27;s wise to steer clear of any locksmith on Google affiliated products.  Otherwise, you&#x27;ll become a victim of their bait-and-switch schemes (which often run as &quot;$15 unlock in 15 min.&quot; on Google AdWords).  Same could be said for garage door suppliers, carpet cleaners, and handymen--they&#x27;re all run by the same crime group, more or less, and have been honing their craft since the 1980&#x27;s, when they got their start with the printed white and yellow pages before moving on to Google.

So, by virtue of hard work and a lot of luck, I did so.<p>Now, I &#x27;work&#x27; about 5 hours a week from home for an insane salary. I sleep in every day, and have no real schedule to keep. I want for nothing material, but I struggle to fill my time so that I don&#x27;t get bored.  There are only so many books you can read, so many musical instruments you can become proficient at, etc, before keeping yourself busy becomes a job in and of itself. All my friends work typical 9-5 jobs, so I can&#x27;t just call someone up and ask them to meet for lunch/drinks somewhere.  I thank my lucky stars for my wife&#x27;s company, otherwise the isolation would be too much to bear.<p>I&#x27;ve been doing this for years, and what I&#x27;ve learned is that for me, happiness == other people.  Not time, not possessions, not fast cars, people.  Specifically, people that I like (of course).

Between lower encouragement of computers as girls toys at younger ages, the fact that there is still a bit of an expectation that men will be the primary breadwinner in the family and thus women can get these lower paying but more rewarding jobs, the fact that the large existing gender gap makes it less comfortable for women in the major, in the workplace, and so on, it&#x27;s unlikely that there&#x27;s going to be one single cause for it.<p>So, in summary, while from what I found it looks like it&#x27;s not prestige but how rewarding the job is perceived to be that makes more of the difference, but that&#x27;s not to say that your hypothesis is wrong, just that I found some evidence to support a different effect that at least appears to be stronger than the effect you describe.",1424631386

And it is also quite safe (relative to C) without having all of the Rust safety features that make me want to kill the borrow checker with a rusty spoon.<p>Swift is totally garbage collected: every object is atomically reference counted. (This is necessary for compatibility with Objective-C.) So Swift is essentially in the same category as Go, Java, and most other languages as far as memory management is concerned.<p>Garbage collection is simply not a cost that we wanted to pay with Rust, in order to reach performance parity with C++.<p>> I really wish Rust walked back on the more esoteric forms of safety (like thread safety, which you can&#x27;t really verify anyway, you just promise the compiler that it&#x27;s safe) and it tried to drive a bargain like Swift.<p>I don&#x27;t understand &quot;you just promise the compiler that it&#x27;s safe&quot;. Rust prevents you from accessing data in a non-thread-safe way without a mutex or atomics. This is in fact something that just fell out of the memory safety features above and didn&#x27;t require any extra features: see [1] for an elaboration on this point.<p>> Rust really isn&#x27;t satisfied to adopt the safety features that are &quot;fairly low effort&quot;, it wants to break new ground without really measuring developer cost (hard to do since it&#x27;s not widely used).<p>We have been measuring developer cost all along, by writing hundreds of thousands of lines of code in the language as we&#x27;ve been developing it: the Rust compiler is written in Rust, and we&#x27;ve been developing Servo as well.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://smallcultfollowing.com/babysteps/blog/2013/06/11/on-the-connection-between-memory-management-and-data-race-freedom/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://smallcultfollowing.com/babysteps/blog/2013/06/11/on-t...</a>",1424630376

For quite a while now now, there has been a glut of law school grads that are unable to find jobs. Furthermore, more and more legal work is being outsourced to India (and this trend keeps rising) or automated (like discovery).<p>If your assertion is true, then several years ago, when both of these characteristics of the legal profession started to occur (few job prospects after graduation and outsourcing/automation), then we should be able to observe a significant decrease in the number of women choosing to pursue a law degree versus men choosing to pursue a law degree.<p>Has such a discrepancy between the genders been observed in the quantity of law school applicants?<p>What I&#x27;ve observed is that women tend to go into careers that are &quot;high-touch&quot; and that factors like prestige and job security are lesser considerations. Teaching and nursing are the two canonical examples. The only parallel I can draw to job security, is that high touch jobs are far harder to automate and outsource. Japan has been trying with some of its robot experiments, but the uncanny valley is a high barrier to cross to automate high-touch jobs.<p>Interestingly this is why we see engineering/automation making doctors less relevant, while we see nursing becoming more important. Technology to aid with the low-touch aspects of medicine (the tasks doctors typically perform, such as pattern detection and pattern matching) are getting good enough that those interested in the high-touch aspects (nursing), can do most of the work required without the need to share responsibilities with a doctor.<p>(FWIW while society considers doctors to be higher prestige than nurses, I feel they are both equally important. IMHO, being a doctor as a profession having higher prestige is a historical anomaly since there are statistically fewer people in society who are good at the analytical work that computers now excel at. For thousands of years, sexual selection favored neurotypical minds. It has only been in the past ~100 years or so since the industrial revolution where sexual selection has started to favor sexual selection in favor of those on the aspie/autistic side of the spectrum).",1424630144

If you use a CDN or other sort of caching service, a significant fraction of traffic never hits your server, and your logs are incomplete.<p>2. Logfile parsing does not measure on-page events that do not involve a server call (such as certain UI interactions, and clicking exit links out to other websites).<p>3. Parsing logfiles gives crap data.<p>There&#x27;s a <i>ton</i> of filtering and heuristics that are built into modern web analytics tools. It&#x27;s a back-breaking task to re-implement them, and your data is literally less-than-useless until you&#x27;re at leas part-way through the list (as in, provides negative value because it drives you to incorrect conclusions).<p>For example: Web crawlers. Google, Bing, Ask, Baidu, Yandex, and a dozen smaller or region-specific search engines all generating automated traffic to your site. Some of their IP&#x27;s are public, but Google intentionally runs anonymous web crawlers to make sure people aren&#x27;t sending Google different pages than what they send humans. And those are just the <i>legimate</i> robots. By some estimates, as much as 50% of modern web traffic is robots. The majority of these are spam bots of one form or another. You know, those one that troll forums with ad links or malware? Those guys aren&#x27;t negligible.<p>Another example: Associating multiple visit sessions from the same person. This is a fuzzy statistical decision based on cookies, IP address, user agent string, device type, and other data. It&#x27;s complicated, with a lot of edge cases. Modern tools aren&#x27;t 100% accurate, but they&#x27;ve already seen and accounted for a decade of exceptions.<p>Another example: Cache-busting. Networks and browsers will cache server calls (including beacon-based tracking), no matter how much you explicitly tell them not to. Unless you specifically write scripting to add random tokens to each of your server calls, you will actually be working with data that has been sampled to an unknown extent. And unlike GA, the sampling is page-based rather than visitor-based which means that visit sessions will have holes in them.<p>In my work as a web analyst, I worked with one company was moving off their own home-rolled system based on Apache log files. They were even putting information from this into their quarterly earnings report. Once we set them up with a &quot;real&quot; system, we found that their homebrew system had over-stated traffic by a factor of ten. Some combination of bot traffic, and users on consumer broadband having variable IP addresses, and cross-domain cookie tracking meant that the web aspect of their business had only 10% of the reach they previously thought.<p><i>THAT SAID</i>... rolling your own home-brew system is sometimes the correct answer. I&#x27;m working with two such clients right now, and they are making the decision that is right for them. It&#x27;s not the right decision for the majority of companies--it&#x27;s a large engineering effort, and it needs to have a significant expect payout.",1424629241

With one exception (existing illegal units) planning restrictions have only gotten worse. For example development along the Embarcadero has been banned by ballot measure. Meanwhile the key rules continue to steadily tightened with things like the Eastern Neighborhoods Plan. And it&#x27;s not just the rules but the slowness of the process that makes it so painful and costly.<p>And that&#x27;s just SF Planning. Numerous other SF Gov created problems also make development incredibly slow and costly. I&#x27;ll just quickly list a few examples: SF Bulding Code does not permit plastic drain pipe; anyone can easily demand a hearing on an already issued building permit; SF Water charges $9000 for a new water meter; and rent control laws are strict and constantly changing. All of these are as strict or stricter in SF than almost anywhere in the US.<p>The reason for the jump in building is that office and apartment rents have become so ridiculously high it now makes sense to build in the few remaining sites despite all the costs. Even these projects had to go through tortuous approval process, such as the Transbay Transit District, and unbelievably many projects started back in the last tech boom! The building boom will likely grind to a halt in a few years as builders run out of sites.<p>Rant over.

I&#x27;d like to get a firm grasp on what to expect for equity.  My role would be senior engineer, tech lead, or engineering manager.  I&#x27;m currently a top performer at a well-known start-up, have a good resume, and interview really well.<p>Besides some limited feedback from peers, most of what I have to go off regarding equity is here:<p>https://www.wealthfront.com/tools/startup-salary-equity-compensation<p>Unfortunately this data is segmented by company size as opposed to company valuation (or FMV) at the time of grant.  Ideally, I&#x27;d like to get some idea of what a good &quot;dollar value&quot; equity offering might be, if you compute &quot;dollar value&quot; as:<p><pre><code>    dollar value = %ownership * current valuation (not FMV)\n</code></pre>\nFor example, 50,000 options out of 100,000,000 total issued would be 5 basis points.  If the company&#x27;s current valuation (not FMV) is $150m, that&#x27;d be $75,000 in &quot;dollar value&quot;.  I think putting options in these terms makes the most sense, as it becomes easy to value them against the company&#x27;s growth.  In the above case, if the company quadruples, I stand to gain about 4 x $75,000 (minus price to exercise).  I&#x27;m very familiar with how options work, FMV vs actual valuation, strike price, vesting, etc... no help needed there.<p>Just looking for some data points about how much &quot;dollar value&quot; in equity companies are offering, and can be negotiated for, nowadays.  For example, how many RSUs are Google and FB giving out?  How about start-ups?  How much will it vary with company stage (seems like it should remain roughly constant)?<p>Thanks.",1424628374

9090228,comment,9088640,9089627,0,0,lambda,,,"I&#x27;m curious why you characterize it as a &quot;punishment&quot;? Do you actually think that is why anyone designed the system this way, as some kind of aversion therapy just to get you to avoid using floating point numbers?<p>All Rust is doing here is implementing IEEE 754 floating point semantics as specified, and implemented in lower level hardware. Part of the IEEE 754 specification that you need to deal with if you want to use floating point numbers is NaN, which represents not an actual value but the absence of a value, an indication that your computation did something that could not be represented. Because NaN is one of the possible values of a floating point number, a typesafe interface for comparing floating point numbers must, by definition, be a partial function; and as a partial function, it cannot be relied upon for implementing sort.<p>The Rust way of doing this does not punish you, it just ensures that you actually think about, and deal with, edge cases like this. While that can seem cumbersome in a small, one liner example like the above, or can seem restrictive when you&#x27;re writing a simple personal project and you know that you will never encounter a NaN and so you just want to sort the values without thinking about that, it can be quite valuable when programming in the large; when you are working on a program larger and more complex for any one person to know and reason about the whole thing, type safety allows you to encode certain constraints in the type system that ensure that you don&#x27;t make mistakes.<p>For instance, if you write code that depends on sorting a list of floating point values in Python, like in your example, and write all of your unit tests and design using non-NaN floating point values, then use a third party library that winds up producing a NaN value, you are likely to be quite surprised by the outcome:<p><pre><code>  >>> nan = float(&#x27;nan&#x27;)\n  >>> xs = [1, nan, 0, 3, 5, 2]\n  >>> sorted(xs)\n  [1, nan, 0, 2, 3, 5]\n</code></pre>\nNow, deep in the middle of production code, that result might not be so apparent. Most of the values that you care about are ordered correctly; but eventually you&#x27;ll hit the fact that the 1 is sorted before the 0, so you&#x27;ll have some strange, hard to reproduce bug, that depends on the precise ordering of the original array.<p>What Rust is doing is not punishing you, but instead just making you make that decision about what to do about such a case up-front, before you accrue that technical debt that comes to bite you later on.<p>There are several possible ways you could deal with it; one is the one you mentioned, where you just define some way of comparing NaN so that you now have a total order. Another would be to panic any time you try to do an undefined operation like comparison on a NaN. Or you could work with a type that is restricted to non-NaN values, and deal with the issue only at the boundary of components which convert between arbitrary floating point values and your restricted subset (and any operations that may produce NaN values).<p>In order to not have to write those cumbersome sort expressions by hand every time, if you need to work with floating point numbers with one of the non-standard semantics described above, you could define any of the above behaviors by creating a newtype the wraps floats but provides the semantics you want. Since they are static types, there will be no overhead on the values, they will just be represented as floats; you may have some overhead on your checked operations that wrap the underlying float operations, but that the price you pay for going with semantics which are not the standardized IEEE 754 semantics as implemented by the hardware. In a larger project, if you need such a type, it&#x27;s not all that much work to just define that type once with the semantics that you want, and then just use that everywhere rather than using one of the native floating point types.<p>So, what Rust is providing is a type-safe, low-overhead implementation of IEEE 754 floats, without providing certain conveniences that would make your life easier when dealing with a subset of them but cause problems when working on the full range of values.<p>Can it be convenient to accrue technical debt in order to get things done quickly? Sure. Shell scripts are a classic example; almost every non-trivial shell script will have some kind of quoting bug, delimiter bug, confusion between arguments and flags if an argument value ever contains a &quot;-&quot;, or the like. But because they are familiar and allow people to get things done quickly, they can be really useful for little one-off hacks, especially when you&#x27;re working with data that you know is simple enough not to hit one of those edge cases, like filenames where you know that none of them contain spaces.<p>However, you need to be really careful about that sort of thing. That kind of quick and loose reasoning can quickly come to bite you if it gets deployed in production in an uncontrolled or even hostile environment. All of as sudden, the things you thought could never happen will happen. I&#x27;ve seen a seemingly innocuous shell script for cleaning up a few particular types of files turn into an &quot;rm -rf *&quot; due to a bug in handling of spaces in filenames (and yes, an actual customer lost actual data due to this bug).<p>So, is Rust appropriate for that kind of fast-and-loose exploratory programming that the shell or dynamic languages like Python allow you to do? No. If I were working with known inputs, interactively, where I could easily tell that I didn&#x27;t have NaNs and could check the outputs to make sure they were sane, I would choose Python and numpy, or Julia, or something of the sort that was more appropriate for rapid and loose prototyping.<p>But for software that will be deployed in the wild, where I need to write modules that will work with values provided by other modules that I don&#x27;t control, or the like, making you think about this kind of thing up-front can help you avoid having weird, obscure, hard to debug problems, or even security vulnerabilities, down the line.",1424628222

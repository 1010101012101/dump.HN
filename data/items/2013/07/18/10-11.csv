6062796,comment,6061816,6062736,12,0,mixmax,,,"I think that this line of thinking is part of the problem in the US. The lack of capital punishment in Norway is a feature not a bug, and if you look at the results it&#x27;s a good feature. Norway has very low crimerates compared to the US, far fewer homicides and almost no problems with guns and violence.<p>The Unites States has a mentality of punishing the perpetrators, often very hard, in order to gain revenge and maybe act as a deterrent to others. This is why the US is one of the onlycountries in the world that use capital punishment, and the country in the world where most people are in prison.<p>Unfortunately research shows that this doesn&#x27;t work, as evidenced by crimerates and homicides in the US. Norway takes a different approach, and instead of looking for revenge they ask &quot;how do we prevent this from happening again&quot;. This is why there is no capital punishment, why you see drug offenders in nice rehabilitation homes, and why Breivik was convicted like any other murderer within the Norweigan system.<p>The Norweigan system works, and the American doesn&#x27;t. Just look at the numbers.",1374145091

PBS Frontline later filmed at the scene of the attack, the footage showing the ruined foundations of a small building along with a nearby crater. Abdel- Rahman Anwar al Awlaki, the 16-year old son of al-Awlaki, died... the article is written by NASSER al-AWLAKI... Also initially reported killed was militant Ibrahim al-Bana. Doubts have since been raised about al-Banas death.  A statement from Abdel-Rahmans family read, he left with some friends for dinner under the moonlight when an American missile landed, killing Abdel-Rahman and his friends. In a separate statement, the family said:  On October 14th, 2011 Abdulrahman, along with some of his tribes youth have gone barbecuing under the moonlight.  A drone missile hit their congregation killing Abdulrahman and several other teenagers. A second teenager and family member, Ahmed Abdel-Rahman al-Awlaki, 17,  is known to have died. Five to seven others were also killed, including Sarhan al-Qusa (aka Farhan al Quso) brother of AQAP leader Fahd al-Qusa or Quso, according to a member of Awlakis tribe. Reuters later claimed that the dead men were planning to renounce al Qaeda before they were killed. Elders claimed that four other Awlaki tribal members died in the strike.<p>Two weeks after the strike, AQAP released leaflets stating that Ibrahim al-Bana had not been killed. Ansar al-Sharia also reported in its second October newsletter that Banas death was a lie. In a statement, Yemen security officials said the air strike was among five that targeted al Qaeda positions in Shabwa, adding that al-Bana was wanted internationally for planning attacks both inside and outside Yemen. He was one of the groups most dangerous operatives, it said. The Washington Post reported that it was JSOC rather than the CIA which carried out the attack:<p>When pressed on why the CIA had not pulled the trigger, US officials said it was because the main targetan Egyptian named Ibrahim al-Banna, was not on the agencys kill list. The Awaki teenager, a US citizen with no history of involvement with al Qaeda, was an unintended casualty. In interviews, senior US officials acknowledged that the two kill lists dont match, but offered conflicting explanations as to why.\nIn April 2012 the Toronto Star featured an interview with Nasser al-Awalaki, grandfather of Abdel-Rahman and former Yemen government minister. In it he said that former Yemen President Saleh had sent him a message insisting that he had had no role in his grandsons death: Tell Dr. Nasser I swear to God that I have nothing to do with the killing of his son.Nasser al-Awlaki also said he would be taking legal action: I am only a university professor and Im not the kind of guy who would enlist tribal people. My only chance now is to go to court and I hope as far as Abdulrahman at least, they will be fair to us. They cannot claim hes collateral damage.<p>In April 2013 Jeremy Scahill added further controversy to the attack, reporting:<p>A former senior official in the Obama administration told me that after Abdulrahmans killing, the president was surprised and upset and wanted an explanation. The former official, who worked on the targeted killing program, said that according to intelligence and Special Operations officials, the target of the strike was al-Banna, the AQAP propagandist. We had no idea the kid was there. We were told al-Banna was alone, the former official told me. Once it became clear that the teenager had been killed, he added, military and intelligence officials asserted, It was a mistake, a bad mistake. However, John Brennan, at the time President Obamas senior adviser on counterterrorism and homeland security, suspected that the kid had been killed intentionally and ordered a review. I dont know what happened with the review.\nAnd in May 2013 US Attorney-General Eric Holder told US lawmakers Abdulrahman was not specifically targeted by the United States. In a letter, Holder explained Anwar al Awlaki was a legitimate target and that [US] citizenship alone does not make such individuals immune from being targeted. He said three other US citizens, including Abdulrahman, had been killed by US drones during Obamas presidency.<p>Abdulrahmans grandfather discusses his death in a July 2012 interview for ACLU and CCR<p>Type of action: Air assault, drone strike\nLocation: Azan, Shabwa\nReferences: CNN,  GlobalPost, Business Insider, Yemen Post, ABC, AFP (via Taiwan News), Reuters,Press TV, AP, Washington Post, Long War Journal, LA Times, Reuters, Yemen Post,  Time Magazine, Antiwar.com, Empty Wheel, Salon, Al-Awlaki family statement, EmptyWheel, Toronto Star, PBS Frontline, CNN, The Nation (US), Department of Justice<p>i was first turned onto this site[1] from an app that attempted to text you every time a new drone strike was posted to this site,\nthe APPL app store refused its submission a number of times citing &quot;The features and/or content of your app were not useful or entertaining enough&quot;<p>.[1]. <a href=""http://www.wired.com/dangerroom/2012/08/drone-app/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.wired.com/dangerroom/2012/08/drone-app/</a>",1374144855

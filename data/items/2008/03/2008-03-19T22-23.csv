141226,comment,141119,141119,0,0,nostrademons,,,"At my last employer, there was one former founder that I ended up giving a ""No hire"" recommendation to my boss on.  During the interview, it came out that his idea of founding a company was that he had this wildly ambitious, game-changing idea, and then he <i>outsourced it to a bunch of Russian programmers to write</i>, using his parents' money.  And then he blamed them for not delivering when I asked him what he'd learned from the experience.<p>Let's think of the red flags there: 1) Doesn't have a clear conception of what he's capable of.  2) Unwilling to get hands dirty and code.  3) Because of this, didn't learn any technical skills that'll be useful in the job.  4) Won't take responsibility for his own failures.<p>In almost any other situation I can think of, doing your own startup would put you way ahead of the pack.  I was actually pretty excited about the above candidate when I saw ""founder"" on his resume, 'till he blew it in the interview.",1205967306

141209,comment,140363,140363,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"Asimov's two big universes, found in the Robots series and the Foundation series, (which turned out to be the same when he revisited them in the 70's and 80's) are simply wonderful.  By far my favorite sci-fi, and among the most enduring works in the genre.  I read them both every two or three years, and sometimes grab one off the shelf when I just want something to read.  The early Foundation is sort of a future history version of ""The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire"" (I seem to recall that was intentional, actually).  Asimov's autobiographies and the posthumous book of his correspondence are all fantastic and insightful.  I learned a lot from them, and my admiration for the man increased even more upon reading them.<p>Dune is also astoundingly good, though after the first three, the quality goes downhill (slowly, but surely).  Definitely lots to think about.<p>Rendezvous with Rama left me breathless...and I could not put it down until I'd read the last page.  I've returned to it a couple of times, and loved it every single time.  The later Rama books are deeply flawed, and should have never happened (they were not written by Clarke, and it shows), as they make Rama seem...hmmm, I can't really think of the right word that expresses it.  Cheap, dinky, small, something bad.  But Rendezvous is a must read for everyone.<p>Douglas Adams, of course.  The whole Hitchhikers' series is a must, while the Dirk Gently stuff is also funny, but not sci-fi and not mandatory.<p>I mentioned in another thread my love of dystopias, and one of the best ever is The Handmaid's Tale by Margaret Atwood.  She's one of the best sci-fi writers alive (she doesn't exclusively write sci-fi, however).  Oryx and Crake is also fascinating.<p>Cat's Cradle by Kurt Vonnegut.  I enjoy all of Vonnegut's work, but Cat's Cradle is a magical perfect novel.<p>I don't know if everyone would agree that it's sci-fi, but Mark Twain's Letters from the Earth was an eye opener for me when I was a kid (I went on a Mark Twain kick when I was in elementary school...no one ever told me that all of his books weren't kids books, so I read everything I could get my hands on after being hooked by Tom Sawyer and Huckleberry Finn).  Turns out Mark Twain was seditious, heretical, and quite the troublemaker all around.",1205966189

141196,comment,140863,141082,0,0,mechanical_fish,,,"I'm with you, but I think the trend is in the other direction. As a lifelong book collector, my eyes were opened when I heard Cory Doctorow (an even more obsessive bibliophile) state that he was thinking of selling off most of his books -- the logic being that, in a world with digitized libraries, eBay, Amazon and ABE books, it's easier and cheaper for him to just obtain a used copy of anything he wants to reread and sell it on the used market after he's done.<p>I don't actually believe this enough, yet, to put it into practice, but it shocked me into thinking about it.<p>It is <i>grossly</i> inefficient for me to have to keep a physical copy of <i>Star Wars</i> around in my house just to prove that I bought the darned thing. It is grossly inefficient to have my own, personally recorded collection of every single Alton Brown <i>Good Eats</i> episode. These things are not rare: They are treasured by zillions of fans. They are unlikely to become rare in my lifetime. I have, or will soon get, all the bandwidth I need to download them on demand. The only reason I have to cart them from one apartment to the next is that our stupid copyright laws make it easy for their creators to jerk me around -- raising prices, charging me over and over again, editing the films to make them different from what I remember, taking the films off the market for ten years, inserting artificial roadblocks that make no sense in the high-bandwidth era (like physical DVDs from Netflix instead of digital downloads from Youtube HD)  -- unless I buy a physical copy and make it my own.<p>I don't think that's going to last. Time is not on the side of that model. It's not as efficient and the people who still believe in it get older by the day.",1205965412

There is no obviously legal way, however, as Apple bans all code which can run or compile other code.<p>It would be irrational for Apple to support Flash on the iPhone, for several reasons. While performance and drain on battery life are certainly factors, I believe that the stronger element is that Apple wants to own the development environment.<p>Currently, if you want to develop for the iPhone, you need to use Apple's APIs, and Apple's runtime..

7413894,comment,7413402,7413402,3,0,616c,,,"On a somewhat related tangent, but a tangent just the same, Ada came to my mind because people in another thread about avionics in relation to the Malaysia Air Flight were debating the efficacy and/or safety of Ada versus a language like, for example, Haskell.<p>When I looked into Ada and memory management, out of curiosity, I did not find a lot of information about pointers.  Or a garbage collection system, and casual reading confirms that Ada has a less manual version of pointers (from what I gather) and manual memory management, and no garbage collection.  Given its syntax and semantics, which remind me very, very vaguely of Haskell (which I am sure is bound to insult someone on HN, specifically Haskellers), I could not imagine this as a systems language.  Then again, even though I am ignorant of such things and do not know C/C++ (the latter I only took briefly in undergrad, and I have mixed reactions), I am product of the C/C++ generations and the stand of the shoulders of Unix and Linux giants, as I have looked into computer science and Linux application source code in attempt to understand.  Not even write the code mind you, just understand.  Perhaps others were exposed to Pascal and BLISS, so the alternative perspectives made it seem possible.  I do not have that perspective, so I feel dazed and confused by alternative offerings when reading them.  I get the idea generally, but still whisper to myself with a concerned &quot;How!?&quot;, even though it should be more obvious.<p>In short, I cannot really conceive of manual memory management without pointers and pointer arithmetic as it presented in C and/or C++.  I was terrible at it, granted, but everything else I see from Rust to other system languages which promise a systems language without GC and offer some equivalent of memory management done manually do not click.  They seem foreign and impossible because I have always assumed, for better or worse, C is the way you interface with a modern PC or embedded system by managing each and every pointer, or you are on your way to assembly and then memory is one of many complicated underpinnings you must understand intimately, not just the must troublesome one.<p>But I am an amateur programmer.  I recently the saw the threads on FORTH.  I want to look because, as much as I &quot;know computers&quot; the idea of this kind of very low level stack language is very foreign to me, just from looking at it I feel odd and not sure how it could possibly work.  The same would be true of writing low level code in Haskell.  I like it a lot, for all its beauty and warts, but I have just assumed you must learn to manage such things manually and in an ugly fashion a la C/C++ to learn system management in a programming language in our generation, and no amount of screaming or holding your breath until in the red face will change that.<p>However, a lot of this is conditioning.  Maybe others can share other observations to counter my admittedly very naive experience.",1395046751

That was sincerely not intended. I apologize for that.<p>Frankly, my purpose in providing a plausible defense for GitHub is that the TechCrunch story itself only presents a single side of the story, though I understand that sometimes that&#x27;s necessary for someone to come forward and draw the necessary attention to an injustice like this.<p>It is, however, easy to read the TechCrunch article and immediately point 100% of the blame on GitHub when we don&#x27;t know the facts. I think it&#x27;s helpful to step back and look at the accusations for what they are: accusations.<p>As others have pointed out, GitHub&#x27;s response says very little in terms of confirming or denying the accusations, but it does say that they are professional enough to take this seriously.<p>Horvath may be doing GitHub (or various people at GitHub) a favor by going light on some details - the facts may be far worse than they appear on the surface. She (or the TechCrunch writers) may also be skimping on details in order to paint GitHub with broad strokes. There are numerous plausible motives in either case, but I won&#x27;t speculate as to the motives here as I&#x27;ve learned it doesn&#x27;t help to spread false accusations.<p>It isn&#x27;t fair to accuse Horvath of being anything less than 100% truthful, and by the same token, it isn&#x27;t fair to assume everything she said is 100% truthful without GitHub coming forward with their side of the story.<p>Again, I apologize for my comment earlier leading to speculation where we (as the public) really have no say in the matter since we have so few facts. It&#x27;s an unfortunate situation for everyone involved and I hope it can be resolved in a positive way for both parties. For me, at least some of the followup comments here have been helpful in better understanding some of the ideas involved in this story - e.g., sexism, appropriate handling of conflicts in the workplace, roles of founders and spouses, etc (in general terms, not necessarily in connection with this story).",1395046416

So I don&#x27;t think the DMCA distinguishes between infringing copyright for profit or otherwise.<p>That being said, if this site gives much more opportunity to making profit from copyright infringement, then it&#x27;s more likely to become a target for &#x27;pirates&#x27; trying to make a quick buck out of other people&#x27;s copyright work.<p>The site can do something similar to what youtube is doing, which is to forfeit any profits if a copyright complaint is made (and maybe even giving those profits to the original copyright holder).

I say you have/will want to do a lot yourself, but you don&#x27;t have to do it all.<p>Be aware that SICP is written for Scheme.  They&#x27;re both lisp dialects, but they are different.  I&#x27;ve done bits of it here and there in Common Lisp, but the two variable namespaces, no first class continuations, different function names, less emphasis on recursion (due to specific iteration forms/macros in Common lisp) and native efficient data structures offered by common lisp might make some things non-applicable or difficult even if you&#x27;re already familiar with the language.  Tail call optimization is, i believe, not required  in the Common Lisp standard, but I believe SBCL performs it, at least above certain low optimization declarations.<p>I&#x27;ve only just started looking at multi-threading in Common Lisp myself.  I imagine the proper answer about &quot;mature&quot; parellelization is no, relative to some other languages (i have no real basis for this, just side-knowledge that other languages focus on such issues more.  Hell, its probably better than R.).  Multi-threading is not established in the language specification, but in practice, implementations have their own version of it, including SBCL, which is the version I&#x27;m sticking to for numerical work.  If you&#x27;re looking into it, I believe you might also get acquainted with Bordeaux Threads.  Once you&#x27;ve got quicklisp installed, you can install that easily from there :P<p>That being said, when you&#x27;re performing something 10-500 times faster than the interpreted memory-hungry mess that is R for example, the complication of multi-threading can fall down the priority list...<p>Totally independent of my decision to try to the language, i later found this paper,which suggests that one of the authors of R is well aware of and in agreement with some of my own observations, plus there&#x27;s a benchmark in there of common lisp, R, and python, though take all such microbenchmarks with a grain of salt, because you will be spending more programmer time in Common Lisp:<p><a href=""https://www.stat.auckland.ac.nz/~ihaka/downloads/Compstat-2008.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.stat.auckland.ac.nz/~ihaka/downloads/Compstat-20...</a><p>Unlike some language zealots, i feel its my responsibility to remind you this is the road less traveled. I don&#x27;t think its the way industry/academia is moving.  I think there is, perhaps arrogantly, a selection bias in who becomes a Common Lisp programmer, such that inquisitive/smart/alternatively-thinking people tend to be attracted to the language, but if you think it will magically makes you 100 times better than you already are because some other smart guy uses it, put that idea right out of your head.<p>But also honestly, I&#x27;ve found the experience extremely rewarding, and I code my own projects in Common lisp now where I can.<p>I came in the top 20 of <a href=""http://www.kaggle.com/c/facebook-recruiting-iii-keyword-extraction/leaderboard/private"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.kaggle.com/c/facebook-recruiting-iii-keyword-extr...</a> by literally coding something up from scratch in common lisp, and my model had easy room for improvement and was among the fastest, so you can most certainly compete writing in lisp.<p>Now, aside from my eternal side-project, I&#x27;m trying to put something together in the field of data linking in Common Lisp. I think its one of the only options that will let me combine the flexibility of dynamic languages with the performance of C...(i&#x27;m actually hoping to perform better than the US Census Bureau C program)...I already know it blows the current python/R options out of the water, but time will tell whether I can match it with C performance-wise...",1395045082

This prevents inadvertent transmission of incorrect squawks should the pilots mis-key.<p>e.g. once squawk 7500 Hijack is transmitted, ATC <i>must</i> implement appropriate measures regardless of what the crew subsequently do or say.  Consider that fact given 7050 is a valid non-emergency squawk.<p>Once the squawk has been confirmed as correct the transponder is returned to active status.",1395044853

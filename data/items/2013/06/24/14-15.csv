Having voted in both the UK and Australia, I&#x27;ve concluded that compulsory voting in Australia leads to a type of popularity contest, and that the so called informal vote is viewed as either one of an error, a wasted opportunity for democratic engagement, or an act of stupidity. Certainly when counting votes, the informal votes are discarded as merit less.<p>In the UK the election turnout percentage is just as important a metric for measuring overall confidence in the political process as the proportion of votes gained for the candidates.

Help them better themselves and in the process you better yourself. You learn valuable skills like patients and empathy both go a long way and people see them in your actions. When people know you are a genuinely good person not acting in self interests they are more likely to genuinely like you both on and off line. The original poster is right, the quest for karma or any other recognition is a self serving quest, the fruits of which are always tasteless and unrewarding because they are a quest for acceptance hidden behind a trinket. Once you receive the trinket the acceptance for that act is gone and you are left in the same state you where before that. It&#x27;s akin to a drug and it can become addictive, because it is not permanent, the high of momentary acceptance fades and you are back on the treadmill.

Divorcing your self-esteem from these social indicators is important, but difficult as the whole point of them is social coercion.<p>Which in a round about way brings us back to why you should care (but only a little)-  karma exists to push people into conforming with the rules of society on the site.  If you are being punished too badly in the karma ranks you are not conforming. (Karma also has a lot of noise - a little punishment is to be expected.)   This will presumably be punished with a hell ban after some instance of severe enough non-conformity, and with that youll be straight out of the community.<p>Id look at what you are doing, and if the things you are being punished for are things that matter to you (and thus perhaps you should give up on this place), or are stylistic, or some form of social grace.

But even if I allow your dubious use of fair, did they really pay them all? Did they pay for the streets that they used? Did they pay a higher price for the fire department since they probably have a lot more, much more expensive properties than me? Did the pay the police more for similar reasons?<p>If police, streets and so on were funded from taxes, then yes, they paid much more. If they were built by private companies - the same is true.<p>>Did they pay their parents for raising them into privilege?<p>That&#x27;s that pure luck, agreed. But you can&#x27;t punish people for being lucky. You just have wrong understanding of the concept of people being equal. We can be considered equal in our basic rights, but we&#x27;ll never be equal in talent, IQ, motivation, and so on. So if two people start doing the same thing they can have equal chances at the beginning, but will never achieve exactly the same results. One person will always be more successful than other, and there&#x27;s nothing wrong with that.<p>It is like sprinters race on the Olympic games: you have to ensure that all competitors will start running at the same time, but forcing them to also cross the finish line at the same time is just ridiculous. And that&#x27;s what you postulate.<p>> Chile was as close to laissez faire as has ever been tried on that scale. Where did their mass unemployment come from?<p>Stupid monetary policy (fixed exchange rate between dollar and peso), which was against liberalism philosophy that Friedman tried to impose. However Chile basically continues this liberal economical politics and their unemployment rate is currently 6.1%<p>>>In capitalism there&#x27;s always more work to do that workforce available.\n>Ideological dreaming. Nothing more.<p>That&#x27;s not a dreaming, just a mere fact: people&#x27;s needs are unlimited, we always want new cars, computers, clothes, exotic holiday journeys, etc. otherwise economical growth would have stopped once we had learned how to provide basic food and shelter for everyone (which was in late Middle Ages, i think)<p>>Anyway, even if that&#x27;s true, how about you mind your own goddamn business and stop worrying about what other people choose to do with their lives?<p>That is just ridiculous statement when coming from your mouth: it is my goddamn business when someone tries to rob me from my money in a name of your weird understanding of &quot;fairnes&quot; Poor people can do what they want with their lives as long as they stay away from me.",1372084678

When prompted by the US AG they further stalled by requesting more information. Basically they took the approach of &quot;who is this Snowden guy?&quot; and threw up their hands saying &quot;we&#x27;ve tried nothing and we&#x27;re all out of ideas; we&#x27;re confused!&quot; Make no mistake: this is the PRC making a stand against US policy;<p>- Russia likewise (it is reported today) claims it has no &quot;legal authority&quot; to detain Snowden and don&#x27;t know where he is (despite him being contained to the airport as he has no valid Russian visa as far as anyone knows). This, too, is Russia taking a stance against US policy.<p>- Ecuador too of all countries is taking an anti-US stance. It&#x27;s a strange country to claim to be supporting human rights (given its record and persecution of journalists who criticize the president). In a news article today it was mentioned that the US refused to extradite bankers to Ecuador. Are we seeing the true tit-for-tat motives here?<p>- Whether the US will interfere with a Russian commercial airliner that travels in or near US airspace (being the flight from Moscow to Cuba) is an open and noteworthy question. It seems unlikely but the very fact that we even need to ask that question says a lot.<p>- Obama&#x27;s war on whistleblowers exceeds that of all presidents that came before him. &quot;Justice&quot; is not the only goal here. Making an example of these &quot;traitors&quot; is. That can be the only explanation for the disgusting behaviour (arguably torture) that applied to, say, the detention and solitary confinement of Bradley Manning (ostensibly under the guise of &quot;suicide watch&quot;).<p>- the administration&#x27;s adoption of the &quot;Insider Threat Program&quot; basically turns all Federal employees into informants on each other where you can be punished for not informing. This is straight out of the Stasi playbook and happening in the US in 2013. Not only that but different departments and agencies have leeway on defining what &quot;sensitive&quot; information is, which goes beyond &quot;classified&quot;.<p>Third, nothing changes and nothing works... until it does. To take the fatalistic and cynical position that there&#x27;s no point in trying is just... sad.<p>This issue matters and it&#x27;s germane to HN on several fronts.

The math you (are supposed to) learn on a technical training track actually gives you necessary framework to reason about uncertainty and fuzziness; I&#x27;d say programmers and engineers are better equipped to reason about the world correctly - because getting the right answers is the part of their training and jobs.

Even with good filtering I find myself putting down a lot of drivel.  This said, if it opens up the variety of what we&#x27;re reading, it can&#x27;t hurt.  Sometimes I wonder if Amazon and friends unduly cut down on the variety of what I see.  The browsing ability of bookstores has been lost.",1372082489

It wasn&#x27;t until Dub Reggae was developed in Jamaica that the producer became more of a creator than someone sitting back and making sure the track sounded good while the band played it. A music producer and a television producer had similar levels of creative control, for example. But when Dub was created, that all changed. The producer became <i>the</i> focus of the track, because dub is just basic reggae that&#x27;s been re-sampled and bathed in reverb, with some cool space sound effects thrown in. In this paradigm, the producer was also the DJ, sometimes (like in King Tubby&#x27;s case) running their own soundsystem. Dub created the framework by which hip-hop and EDM are created and performed. But that didn&#x27;t happen until the late 1970s.",1372082476

But even if I allow your dubious use of fair, did they really pay them all?  Did they pay for the streets that they used?  Did they pay a higher price for the fire department since they probably have a lot more, much more expensive properties than me?  Did the pay the police more for similar reasons?<p>Did they pay their parents for raising them into privilege?  And on, and on, and on.  Anyone rich today got there on the backs of the society they lived in.  Elon Musk would be nothing had he been born and raised in an Amazon tribe and you know it.<p>>Also, unemployment is an artificial problem that only exists in fundamentally sick, socialist economies.<p>Now you&#x27;re just showing off ignorance [1].

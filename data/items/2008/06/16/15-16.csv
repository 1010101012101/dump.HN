Especially when the message is ""this code is used to be compatible with X, and IMO, X is not very good"". 'Not very good' doesn't really describe the emotion that it gives you.  I'm sure there's probably better ways to criticize another software system, but when you're short on time, sometimes swearing does the trick. Most often I've deleted such comments or re-written it with a more eloquent vocabulary. But in general, I don't think it's forbidden territory.

The list management he's talking about, while a core part of the LISP metaphor, isn't normally considered part of ""functional programming"", which exploits more subtle stuff like lexical closures instead of ""code-only"" function/method references (a lambda is much more than just a function pointer!).<p>Now, I'm not up on my .NET these days, but I'm all but certain a C# function is still a classic CPU call, with its data living on a normal CPU stack and not stashed into the heap somewhere where it can be found by a closure.

218684,comment,218425,218595,0,0,LogicHoleFlaw,,,"In Java, exposing public instance variables of a class is risky because any changes to the internal operation of that class requires modification to the callers of that class. If you write your accessor methods up front then you can add additional behavior to those accesses at a later point in time. That is largely a syntactical issue.<p>A similar reasoning causes the proliferation of interfaces and factories. The inability to dynamically create objects at run-time leads to a great deal of indirection created at write-time and compile time. That's a semantic issue which creates tons of complexity for little gain. Beans are a direct response to these limitations. For instance with most dependency injection frameworks you can alter an XML file to rewire Bean creation without having to recompile or modify the source of your Java codebase. It's a hack emulating a subset of the capabilities of dynamic metaprogramming.<p>The Bean style of operation greatly encourages all of these verbose design styles. Some of it can be avoided through introspection, aspects, and annotations, but that is very clumsy in Java. Java practices have indeed changed a lot since 2000 but the increase in incidental complexity is just stunning.<p>(major edits: expound upon my points.)",1213629728

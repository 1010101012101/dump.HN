Last I checked our intelligence agency were light on manpower especially in the field of developing human assets and all attention was being diverted to the middle east.<p>Secondly I don't think that any military action in north korea is possible without huge consequences,  huge number of casualties both South Korean civilians and coalition forces. The dprk has been watching our moves for the past 60 years and despite what our media wants us to believe, we are not as invincible as we think we are. For one we westerners don't have the stomach to accept the sheer number of casualties, time and time again this has always been one of our critical weaknesses as evidence by the current war in iraq and the vietnam war. The US would never accept another Vietnam. Our military planners know this and have geared our troops for surgical strikes and precession. North korea has built countless number of tunnels and underground bunkers. If you watched one of the videos from the reporters who sneaked in a camera in, their subway systems are designed to double as troop bunkers.<p>I'm inclined to believe that for whatever reason the western media always seems to downplay the the north koreans. Very few countries have the organization and the will to carry out total war with the US. What a lot of people don't get is that they've been playing this defense game for over a millenia. It been well known suspicion that the DPRK export their trench/tunnel warfare tech to Vietnam.<p>It's a shame the koreas being sandwiched between china, russia, japan and the us with each vying for their own interests.

Assuming a finite number of notes in ""normal"" denominations (i.e. not a 8063 cruzeiro note) then it is probably also relatively straightforward to memorise all possible combinations of products and proffered notes. This memorisation might not happen consciously, but through endless repetition.<p>So if you buy a pack of gum for 300 cruzeiros and pay with a 1000 cruzeiro note, just like everybody else did that day, the kid will know that it's 700 in change from memory.

I'm still working on the lesson content, but most of the moving parts are in place. It's built using GWT and Google App Engine. Despite the recent spate of GAE-related postings here, I've been able to make App Engine work fairly well for my needs and team size (i.e. me). Right now my only remaining pain point is the lack of SSL for non-appspot.com domains. Ugh.<p>Quick Brown Frog was very much influenced by patio11- consumer-oriented, and born of personal experience. A year ago, I decided to learn to type properly, and tried to download software from <i>the</i> major vendor of typing software.  It turned out to be a weird PC/Mac hybrid package, and I had to go hunting for a dated uncompression tool just to open the .sit file.<p>When I finally got it uncompressed, I found it was <i>years</i> out of date and would not run on my Mac. I ended up having to order a CDROM version from them in order to get the latest software that would run on my system. (Why offer the dated download at all?!)<p>Thus was my inspiration to create a totally browser-based typing tutor.

Rather than having people volunteer taxes, we write laws forcing people to pay them so that some person doesn't get to skip taxes yet get the benefit of the taxes being volunteered by others.  Likewise, Israel is compelling their citizens to do military service. Heck, if you're an American male, you were compelled to register for the draft from 18-26 years of age and notify them if you moved residences - under the premise that such registration would make a future draft more equitable.<p>I'm somewhat just playing devil's advocate here since I tend to think that putting one's life in jeopardy is different from being compelled toward other ends.  Would you object as strongly if you were compelled to serve the military, but could choose a non-life-endangering position?  Say, IT support?  What if the United States compelled people to do Americorps for a year or two after graduation?  Does that qualify as slavery?<p>I guess I'm curious whether your objection is a more libertarian ""any time the government compels its citizens, it's a form of slavery"" or a life-ethic ""when the government forces its citizens against their will to put their life in jeopardy, it's wrong.""",1290521838

1933661,story,,,1,0,Soymala,"It disgusts me to see all that money spent - for what?",http://www.pressthepresident.com/show.jsp?article=38072,"We are all blabbering about government overspending, and about unemployment, and about our money going somewhere for no reason … but some of us are willing to pay to put tar on somebody because of political reasons. I mean, negative ads are unavoidable during election season, but this year mailboxes and airwaves seemed even more crowded with political attacks than usual. Non-candidate spending on communications advocating the election or defeat of particular candidates reached nearly $400 million this cycle, according to the Center for Responsive Politics, a nonpartisan campaign finance watchdog organization. That's nearly 60 percent higher than the $268 million spent on the 2006 midterm elections. As a result of a series of recent Supreme Court cases dealing with campaign finance, non-candidate entities like party committees, special interest groups, and political action committees could raise and spend unlimited money on these communications, known as ""independent expenditures."" These expenditures can go toward advertising on TV, radio, and the Internet, as well as phone banks, canvassing, and mailings. But voters in some districts saw the effects of the new campaign finance rules more than others. Voters in Colorado and Pennsylvania were perhaps the most inundated with ads opposing particular candidates. The Senate candidates in those two states were the top four most-attacked candidates of the 2010 midterm election cycle, as measured in dollars spent on independent expenditures opposing them. In House races, the Rust Belt region saw the most money spent on these political messages-seven of the ten most-attacked House candidates were from districts in Ohio, Michigan, and Pennsylvania. Some of us did show that they are willing to put their own money against somebody not for anybody. And you think that is fair and wise to do so in this time of recession and high unemployment? Me not and I can openly say that I’m disgusted by that action no matter who and way did it.",1290521029

It would be cheaper than some of the other commercial systems alluded to but still a significant cost compared with other virtualisation platforms. Its also using a proprietary format so you can't mix and match (whereas we are using RAW ISO files). Finally, you'll need VMWare qualified staff instead of regular sys admins. That's another incremental cost that isn't insignificant.<p>Best wishes,<p>Patrick",1290521028

1933653,comment,1932514,1932514,0,0,HilbertSpace,,,"He's missing some major points; I mention two:<p>FIRST POINT<p>Somewhere in the part of the economy he is depending on, the 'rubber has to meet the road'.  That is, someone has to have a business with customers and revenue.  So, he wants to work for that business.  So, when the business brings in, say, $1 million, he gets maybe $10,000 of it, eventually, if his plans all go well.<p>So, his work really is providing crucial value for the business, but he is getting only a tiny fraction of the money from that value.  Bummer for him.<p>So, he would be much better off just being the person running the business and doing the work that is providing the business value and then keeping all the revenue for himself.<p>E.g., if the business is a Web site with ad revenue and if he is a Web developer, then HE should be the one running the Web site instead of the other guy who likely doesn't know how to do the technical work for the Web site.<p>Or, mowing grass is hard work with some value.  But why just mow grass for someone else running a lawn service?  Instead, start a lawn service, mow grass much as before, and keep all the revenue for yourself.  That is, once are good at mowing grass, which is the real work, the extra to start your own grass mowing service can add a lot of revenue and need not be too difficult.<p>SECOND POINT<p>Basically he is advising people to be 'free lancers', that is, with a 'portfolio', 'clients', etc.  For what he is suggesting here, that is, software usage and/or development, there is a big, HUGE problem:  Suppose it takes, on average 1000 times as long to write some software as to learn to use it.  So, roughly 1000 programmers can write enough software that it takes one person all their time just to learn to use all that software.  But the world has many more than 1000 programmers writing software.  So, it is easy to spend more than full time just learning to use software.  Indeed, new software comes forward so fast that it could be more than a full time job just being a 'librarian' getting the materials, cataloging them, and arranging them on shelves, DVDs, or hard disk.<p>So, it is crucial to reduce, even minimize, the 'overhead' time for learning to use software.<p>Here's the BIG RUB:  As a free lancer, mostly he must use the software his clients want used.  So, this week it's Windows Vista, next week Debian Linux, next week Mac, then Windows Server, Android, iPhone, etc.  Or it's Excel, SAS, SPSS, R, Mathematica.  Or it's Word, TeX, LaTeX, or some high end thing from Adobe for making PDF files.  There is no end of such nonsense.<p>Fundamentally, the free lancer has to pay for the learning overhead and gets paid only for using it.  So, it's crucial to keep down the overhead.  There's no shame in this:  No one can hope to learn all that junk; just being a librarian for all it would be more than a full time job.<p>Yes, maybe Fortran, Cobol, Algol, PL/I, Pascal, C, C++, Visual Basic .NET, and C# are closer to each other than English, French, Spanish, and Italian.  Similarly for DB2, SQL Server, Informix, and Oracle.  Similarly for SPSS, SAS, R, etc.  Windows and Linux are both multiple virtual memory operating systems on x86 processors with a TCP/IP stack.  So, there is a lot of overlap so that learning 1000 programs is much less than 1000 times the work of learning just one program.<p>STILL, learning all that software is TOO DARNED MUCH overhead.<p>Here's how to cut down the overhead:  Don't be just the free lancer; instead, be the entrepreneur where the rubber meets the road.  Then pick ONE of Windows or Linux and f'get about the other one.  Say pick Windows.  Then pick ONE of C++, C#, or Visual Basic .NET and f'get about the other ones.  Pick just ONE relational data base, say, SQL Server.  For some 'non-SQL', likely on really simple operations as for non-SQL, the real bottleneck is disk I/O, and, net, SQL Server can be about as fast as 'non-SQL'.  If at times need more than 'non-SQL', and the history of computing strongly indicates that you will, then you are better off with a serious relational data base manager than just some key-value pair system.  Pick just ONE way to develop Web pages, say, ASP.NET.  So, just pick tools sufficient and good for the work where the rubber meets the road and f'get about competitive tools and their overhead.  E.g., my tools just now are Windows, KEdit, ObjectRexx, Visual Basic .NET, a little C (HORRIBLE language), SQL Server, ADO.NET, and ASP.NET, and I've never touched Python, Apache, Ruby, Linux, or even C++.  And I don't use an 'interactive development environment' (IDE) since I use KEdit and ObjectRexx for as much as possible.<p>Enough for the first two points I mentioned above.<p>I move on to several smaller points:<p>COMPUTER CENTER OVERHEAD<p>He also failed to mention:  Now for any very significant work with computers, especially if working as a free lancer for several clients, too soon need multiple computers, an office LAN, etc.  So, he's talking a home based 'computer center' with just one person for ALL the work to be done -- hard/software installation, computer and network system management and monitoring, operations, e.g., backup, recovery, repairs, computer and network security, in addition to the 'money' activities.  He's talking significant upfront, overhead investments of time, money, and effort not easy for a new college graduate.<p>FEAST AND FAMINE<p>People in 'free lance' too soon see that they are in a world of feast and famine.  So, can go for two months with no income and suddenly four clients each want four weeks of work in the next two weeks.  Bummer.<p>FEW OR MANY<p>Not quite the same but closely related, generally (although not always) it's better to have many smaller customers than a few larger ones.  A free lancer has a BIG problem here, but many of the free lancer's clients do not.  So, it can be better to be the client entrepreneur where the rubber meets the road than the free lancer.<p>ASYMMETRY<p>Next, there's the issue of 'asymmetric economic information':  A free lancer who works for one client for a week and gets paid $40,000 lets the client know that he just paid about $1000 an hour for the work.  Then the client will start to look for cheaper labor.  So, the client has too much 'economic information'.  And, really, the free lancer does NOT know what the work was really worth to the client, and that might me much more or much less than $40,000; so the free lancer has too little 'economic information'.<p>Instead it is much better if the customer has no real idea about the supplier's revenue, cost of goods sold, gross margins, net margins, pre-tax earnings, and after-tax earnings.  These may be small or large, but when they are large it is important up to crucial for the supplier to keep these numbers confidential.  One cute, old example was in the early days of casino Blackjack 'card counting':  A guy went to a casino in the Bahamas or some such, dressed like a bum, kept complaining about all the money he was losing and how poor he was.  The individual casinos didn't keep careful track of what he was making or losing so didn't know.  In fact, he was cleaning up big time.  I made a big mistake:  I was a good Blackjack player and saw the first 'Sports Illustrated' article and E. Thorpe's book early on but assumed that the casinos would be swamped.  They weren't for years!  And only a dumb player would show off how much money they were making.  Net, if you are making good money, then keep it QUIET.  For this, generally it is better to have many customers.  E.g., a neighbor had little peanut vending machines -- put in a coin and get out some peanuts.  How much was he making?  There was no easy way for the customers to know, but he did live in a nicer house than I did!<p>BARRIER TO ENTRY<p>There's another big issue, especially over the past 20-40 years in the US economy:  He is recommending being a 'virtual business'.  This is DANGEROUS in the US.  Consider someone in plumbing, HVAC, roofing, grass mowing, auto repair, Chinese carryout, Italian family restaurant, etc.  Notice that they are not in competition with anyone more than 100 miles away.  So, if they are among the best in a radius of 100 miles, then they can do okay.  Many industries cannot have dedicated sales forces so use 'manufacturing representatives' (MRs) that specialize in one industry and stand between many manufacturers and many customers.  So, can have MRs in, say, sporting goods, commercial building supplies, etc.  Well, typically an MR has a geographical 'territory'.  Darned right they have a 'territory':  They don't want any close competition.  Net, it is important to have a 'geographical barrier to entry', and his idea of a 'virtual business' is not careful about this point.<p>COLLEGE<p>He runs down college.  Well, maybe didn't learn Ruby in college, but he should have learned some things more important such as how to communicate and analyze effectively; these are important lessons for a lifetime but maybe not for a first job out of college.  There may be times in life when these lessons are crucial at a big fork in the road and, then, crucial for the whole life.  Also some of the technical material might be quite valuable in the future.<p>KNOWLEDGE SHOULDN'T KNOW<p>One of the biggest dangers of 'knowledge' is not the good knowledge you don't yet know and have to learn but the bad knowledge you have been led to believe and then act on.  So, 'critical thinking' can be more important than 'skills'.  College is one of the best places to get good at 'critical thinking'.",1290520948

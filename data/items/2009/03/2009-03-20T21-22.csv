One thing he is not is a windy tech evangelist. He writes about his experiences small and large. He's a interesting entrepreneur.

A better title would be ""Rails and Django won and also I've given up on writing a better framework"".<p>I agree the article lacks back story and deep analysis (probably making it unsuitable for an HN link), but if you were familiar with his blog that would be unnecessary as the sentiment and not the technical reasons are important.",1237586293

525667,comment,519337,523157,0,0,Rod,,,"The <i>pop-up</i> maneuver's goal is to minimize exposure to enemy fire. Imagine that you're flying an F-16 over enemy territory and that you want to hit a nuclear power-plant with a couple of JDAM's. Since the target is certainly protected by lots of AAA and SAM's, you want to drop the bombs as far away as possible from the target. In other words, you definitely do not want to fly over the target, as that will most likely get you shot down.<p>You can use the <i>pop-up</i> maneuver then. You fly low and fast to avoid radar detection and AAA fire. When you get close to the target you climb at 45 degrees, roll 180 degrees (you are now flying inverted), prepare the JDAM's to be deployed. You then pitch up and when you are at the top of a parabolic flight path, you release the JDAM's. The inertia build-up during the ascent will make the bombs go faster and farther. Once the bombs are deployed, you fly low again.<p>There are some technical papers on this. It's heavy math: optimizing flight paths is not exactly a trivial problem ;-)",1237586060

525602,comment,524837,524837,0,0,dirtae,,,"It sounds to me like leaving this job could be a good move. That said, I am a little worried by the tone of your post. You say that you ""think"" you are quitting your job today and that you've been borderline depressed. I don't think it is wise to go in and quit your job on a day when you are uncertain and still haven't made a final decision. Posting on this forum was a good move, and you've gotten a lot of high quality encouragement from other commenters which could help you make a decision. If you decide to quit your job, then go ahead, make that decision, and then sit on it for a few days. I doubt that it makes a big difference whether you quit your job today or next week. Once you're sure that you're not making a rash decision in the heat of the moment, go ahead and quit. You can use the time between now and the time you quit to plan your exit. I recommend giving a couple of weeks notice that you're leaving and winding down your job in an orderly fashion without burning bridges.",1237583571

However, when you (confidently) mess up in the slightest, you can very well look quite retarded to the natives.<p>In Google's case, that half-finished look could be very intentional and can look a bit humble, as in <i>""I'm sorry I haven't had time to clean up the place, but please come in and make yourself feel at home"".</i><p>You can feel a bit better knowing you don't have to be constantly alert as you would around the presence of perceived perfection.",1237583188

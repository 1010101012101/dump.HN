6617,comment,6352,6385,0,0,ukong,,,"I would say not enforcing the so-called self righteousness is at least a faster way to market a startup, if not making it more successful. It's the ruthlessness of youtube, not soft porn, made its way through.<p>I am not sure about the very first motivation of all business around me. However, apart from possibly ruthless objectives those business are trying to achieve, what is really important is that how iterations of those business ideas can fulfill the (other) needs of everybody else (like me).",1175006371
6616,comment,6505,6603,0,0,zaidf,,,"There was this traditional VC firm that started something modled after YCombinator. But even then, they required a business plan and fund minimum 250,000 so they must be targeting another audience than YCombinator. They were featured in Wall St Journal along with quotes from Paul Graham too if I remember right.<p>I came across Brad's blog while reading a post where he stresses good UI. Since then I have found to enjoy his insights though at the moment I would say Brad's askthevc.com is a more useful read than feld.com",1175005170

Do they always have to talk in that ""newscaster voice?"" How do people stand to watch traditional news coverage?<p>Their chuckles at the end about how Justin.tv is Justin's ""job"" made <i>me</i> laugh. They seemed kind of small-minded about the potential of what Justin.tv is doing. People might be missing the point of Justin.tv: it's an inexpensive platform for live video broadcast... which is pretty cool!",1175004885

In a couple cases I guessed DOBs based on university graduation. I freely admit this is a very lazy attempt and it's flawed, but I didn't see anything like it.

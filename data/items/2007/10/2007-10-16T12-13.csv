Sure, you can point yourself in a direction, but even then, you have to try, fiddle, experiment, and calibrate as you go along, and you might even then arrive somewhere that you didn't set out to go, if you're well placed to grab opportunities.",1192539369
68483,comment,68455,68468,0,0,davidw,,,"You still can't predict just who, out of a reasonably large pool of energetic and determined people, will be the ones with the really big payoffs (for whatever definition of payoff, be it monetary, a big discovery or whatever).  <p>You <i>can</i> probably say with some degree of certainty, which people <i>won't</i> do anything big.  That might still leave a pretty large group of people, though.<p>Who else thinks it would be a lot of fun to see a Graham-Taleb debate on startups?  In the end, I think he'd probably like what YC does, because you're giving some people the freedom to ""tinker"" full time, along with the support to take advantage of the tinkering if it produces something cool.  Given a non-infinite supply of money and attention time, of course you're going to have to pick and choose who gets those things.  I wonder if he would suggest any changes to the format?",1192538971
68482,comment,68146,68353,0,0,mechanical_fish,,,"Yep. This article is painful to read: they propose to eliminate cubes by switching to... open plans and shared tables! Out of the frying pan, into the fire.<p>My home office has a Kinesis keyboard and three monitors placed at the proper height. Now they propose to ""improve"" my office arrangement by forcing me to use a laptop all day? I'll stick with telecommuting, thanks.<p>If I'm going to work at the equivalent of a table in Starbucks, why wouldn't I just work at Starbucks? There's natural light, and the coffee tastes better.<p>And check out this line from the article:<p>""Cubicles can prompt odd behavior... It is hard to see if colleagues are busy, so some cube-dwellers will send emails to a neighbor about a simple question that could have been answered more easily in a conversation.""<p>Yes, the real problem with cubicles is that they make it too difficult to break people's concentration! <p>""Where people in jobs such as marketing tend to want open offices... employees in product groups favor cubes."" No kidding.

68479,comment,68461,68461,0,0,raju,,,"There are a few success stories out there using Rails, starting with, of course 37Signals themselves, and Twitter. Rails has gotten a lot of publicity and there are more than a few Ruby fans out there. <p>I would not call it a holy grail. There has been the growth of several frameworks that use the Rails philosophy recently like Grails and hopefully we will see a few success stories come out of those too. ",1192538468

68476,comment,68164,68164,0,0,Dauntless,,,"What is this ""compete.com"" site, and why are people believing this bogus data and even cite it? <p>The data from this site is highly irrelevant and false.
And the Search Analytics is a joke: For example for wikipedia top keywords are ""snape kills dumbledore page"" and softpedia.com has ""vanessa hudgens pictures"", mit.edu has ""romeo and juliet"", slate.com has ""girls gone wild""... huh? What is this bs?

Any specific reason ?</i><p>No, that was me doing what I said everybody would do - recommending my personal pet favorite. :-)  I just happen to really like Grails as a framework for developing web-apps and Groovy as a language. The combo hits a &quot;sweet spot&quot; for me in terms of productivity and ease of use, and leverages a lot of pre-existing knowledge of the Java / JVM ecosystem that I already had.<p>From a pure &quot;market demand&quot; standpoint, my guess is that RoR or even Node is going to be more valuable than Grails, but I haven&#x27;t empirically validated that - it&#x27;s just a hunch.   In my case, I&#x27;m using Grails in the context of a startup I founded, so it doesn&#x27;t matter to me what the market is screaming for - it just matters what I can use to Get Shit Done. :-)",1410321560

So 23andMe is a cool idea but may be overstepping the data.<p>Plus most people are not able to interpret what these genetic risks mean for them, so delivering the results directly (not through a doctor or preferably genetic counselor) is risky. People tend to think of genes as laws or rules, as guarantees, when really our genomes are complex if-then clauses (if this chemical hits this receptor transcribe that bit there). What if someone decides to get a double masectomy because of BRCA mutations? That&#x27;s a traumatic, expensive procedure, and maybe riskier than the cancer risk; in any case, it&#x27;s a decision that should be made with a medical professional.<p>Finally, 23andMe inexplicably flipped a big old bird to the FDA, their own regulatory agency, by NOT RESPONDING TO THE FDA FOR 6 MONTHS before the warning letter.

8294809,comment,8292029,8294199,1,0,coldtea,,,"><i>Sources or guessing?</i><p>Neither. For one, it&#x27;s obvious that any such products needs at least 1-2 years to design, manufacture prototypes, etc. Second, we&#x27;ve seen several previous exposes of how Apple developed new stuff (iPad was in the labs for 7-8 years, the iPhone the same, etc, and there have been galleries of the tons of prototypes they checked published). So, I was basically just stating the obvious.<p>><i>I think the similarity of how the iWatch and the Android watches work is too similar to be a coincidence</i><p>Well, people already had a uncanillity similar experience to Android watches 5 or so years ago, by strapping an iPod mini to a wrist strap. It&#x27;s a watch that talks to a smartphone and has a computer screen, so of course its similar in that, but that&#x27;s inevitable. The kind of interface, the controls, the fashion styles for the straps and everything, and the internal design / sensors / etc are unique.<p>><i>Basically your story doesn&#x27;t make any sense. The public story is that all Samsung knew was &quot;Apple is working on a watch&quot;, and with that information, completely independently tossed together (with a little help from Google) a device that, in the Gen 2 version of Android Smartwatches, just so happens to work almost exactly like the iWatch minus the nub. The probably of that happen are only slightly less than throwing a bunch of parts into a dryer and at the end of the cycle getting a clock.</i><p>For one, the &quot;almost exactly&quot; is only in the sense that one car and another car do mostly the same things. The design, controls, software and everything is different, from the &quot;nub&quot; to the style choices to the sensors to the charging, to the e-payments, to the app selection UI etc. The Samsung version is sub par in every way.<p>><i>If Samsung developed the smartwatch based on nothing more than a rumor and just slapped it together, then they did one hell of a job because that&#x27;s the template all new smart watches are currently following and they deserve a little more credit. (...) Samsung slapped together a watch based on a rumor, the gen 2 devices were pretty good and Apple simply went the direction with the idea that Samsung had pioneered.</i><p>What are those ideas again? Can you name one thing Samsung did that was a) non obvious part of a smartwatch, b) better?",1410320641

And all those contributors had no guarantee that the Pebble would see the light of day. There is serious demand for a watch that does even what the Pebble originally promised, which is still far far less than what the Apple Watch has now proposed to do.<p>I have been a Pebble watch owner for over a year, after having given up wearing watches around the time I owned my first cellphone. I have come to feel the same NEED of having my Pebble on as I, and everybody else, has with their phone in their pocket. All of the quirks of the Pebble and everything that I have come to realize is missing with the Pebble, is addressed elegantly with the Apple Watch. &#x27;Canned&#x27; and voice responses to messages... Huge. A non-obvious alternative to the classic vibration (which is obvious to people nearby when using the Pebble) in the &#x27;tap&#x27; technology... also clever and smart.",1410319931

8294779,comment,8291934,8294452,13,0,alexqgb,,,"In the last 13 years, they&#x27;ve delivered three new platforms: the iPod, the iPhone, and the iPad. (I&#x27;m not counting Apple TV, since Jobs&#x27; &quot;hobby&quot; designation still very clearly applies). Each of these had extraordinary effects in areas that others either hadn&#x27;t imagined, had imagined badly, or had imagined well but had written off as impossible to achieve. In every case, Apple&#x27;s products - which went onto be world changing, industry revolutionizing, bazillion dollar successes - were widely panned at the time of their unveiling.<p>Not universally, to be sure. Some people loved the iPod instantly. But there were plenty of others who couldn&#x27;t see past the $400 price tag and said &quot;Sure, the iPod: idiots price our devices.&quot;<p>The iPad also landed with a thud, at least online. The people who got their hands on them said &quot;no wait, you <i>really</i> have to try this, it&#x27;s a totally new experience&quot;, but that had to compete with a loud chorus of &quot;meh&quot;, which I certainly understand. Mine (an Air) may not be the most indispensable Apple product I own, but it&#x27;s easily the one I love the most, and the one that gives men the best sense of where Apple is going. That said, it was also a gift, and not something I would have bought for myself. Not until I actually had it and had been using it did I see it less an an individual device, and more as the favorite interface for a (far from realized) cloud-based future of computing. My point is that the Apply routinely makes choices with a long-range logic that is far from immediately self-evident.<p>The iPhone came the closest to being regarded as revolutionary right out of the gate, but even there the excitement was shortsighted. It seemed like the biggest &quot;breakthrough&quot; was getting a handle on voice mail. There was still a lot of doubt about full-touchscreen vs. BlackBerry&#x27;s then-dominant tactile approach. There was bitching about the lack of apps (third party development was web-only) and of course, the <i>endless</i> complaining about Apple&#x27;s &quot;failure&quot; to include &quot;basic&quot; stuff like cut and paste. There was no GPS, no CDMA, and many of the individual components - from the phone itself to the camera to the battery life - were pretty crappy.<p>But all these problems resolved themselves with time. Meanwhile, the fundamentals remained astonishingly stable. So much so that in many cases, major updates were visually indistinguishable from their predecessors. It took most people a long time to recognize how far-thinking the essential design choices really were. And to be fair, it generally took Apple a while before their own development path realized the full scope of the platform&#x27;s potential.<p>But that&#x27;s what these are, platforms built for the long run. If the past is any guide three things should be clear. (1) They come with very well considered development plans (2) What come to be seen as fundamental features of the platform (e.g. the App store) go unannounced when the platforms launch and (3) the immediate negative reactions  - of which there are many - tend to be very short sighted.<p>So no, I will not be buying an Apple Watch in 2015, and probably not in 2016 either. But if the past is any guide, I expect that Apple will be delivering on this for a decade, if not decades to come. By the time it&#x27;s ready to untether from the iPhone, I can see buying in. I&#x27;m looking forward to it.",1410319724

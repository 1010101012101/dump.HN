8062544,comment,8061498,8061834,3,0,dkural,,,"Overall this engine has brought great prosperity. A company makes a lot of money when an external group of people find its services valuable so they keep giving this company money. A &quot;job&quot; is a way for you to be productive for other humans. This is primary, everything else secondary. Take joy in this fact of being useful.  Being paid is a sufficient condition - for everything else there is family, friends, hobbies, pubs etc. An unprofitable company may have &quot;happy employees&quot; ignoring this fact but ultimately, society at large decided to allocate demand to other companies whose services and products society found more valuable.   So,  I don&#x27;t know why an unproductive division consisting of people feel entitled to resources from everybody else?   The end result of this is lay-offs. A company that doesn&#x27;t trim down when demand goes down is jeopardizing everybody else&#x27;s job.  You end up like France & Italy, with bloated unproductive companies, or even worse, Greece, eventually bankrupting the whole country.  This is far more pathological.  On the other hand, breaking the law is breaking the law. Some companies - more accurately, people in them break the law, and should be held responsible.<p>I understand that layoffs are traumatic and put people in hardship.  The correct way to solve this problem is a social safety net, free and universal healthcare & education, and access to new opportunities via specialized training. The wrong way to solve it is force companies to retain people.<p>In other words, we can all help unemployed people by paying more taxes to transfer resources to them to get them back on their feet.  But people of course don&#x27;t like that idea.<p>I vote for fluid labor markets for an efficient economy + strong social safety net.",1405918750

I just want to give my perspective whose intent is not to counter your point or argue with it.<p>As a tech worker, I&#x27;m migrating out of Texas soon. The influx of West Coast companies (and their jobs) to Austin is spiking up prices of, well, everything. There&#x27;s no chance to ever stop renting as all of the Austin property is owned by investors, meanwhile we&#x27;re being payed Texas wages for California jobs at a skyrocketing cost of living in a city with no infrastructure, what-so-ever, to deal with its own population density. I&#x27;m sure companies will continue to move here, but the higher standards of living and worker-friendly political climates of the coasts seem far more attractive.<p>It&#x27;s all just a cycle. Austin will get over-crowded and over-developed and some other neat hip cheap place to do business will spring up and companies will move again. Who knows, your hometown might be next.",1405916406

Many rockets are essentially designed to be single-use, so they can&#x27;t be put through too much stress during testing.  Therefore missions are essentially flown with completely new, largely untested rocket hardware.<p>The work-around is to build two identical copies of the rocket.  The first is a test unit which is tested to failure; the second is put through a very brief test to confirm that it appears to behave sufficiently similarly to the first, and then it&#x27;s put into service.<p>[1]<a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=8060031"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=8060031</a>",1405916344

The next missions did a few tests of the lunar lander in space, and the fifth manned mission was Apollo 11 which finally landed.  Crazy to think of all the systems, hardware, etc. that just had a couple shakedown flights before the real deal.

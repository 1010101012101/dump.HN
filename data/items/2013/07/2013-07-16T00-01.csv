6049449,comment,6048409,6048951,7,0,lambda,,,"2.4 is really old, originally released in 2001. 2.6 has also been around for a long time, and the release cycle changed during the 2.6 timeframe, so the old release number system no longer makes sense.<p>Rather than having a major stable release like 2.4, and then a long period of development in 2.5, followed by a stable 2.6 kernel later on, it switched to much shorter merge windows and release candidate cycles that last about 2-3 months. So you had 2.6.x kernels which were new stable branches, and would get patches such as 2.6.x.y.<p>After a while, this got a little silly. When numbers were getting up to things like 2.6.32.60, it gets hard to keep track of the numbers. Since the first two numbers were just sitting there unused, at some point Linus decided it was silly, and they would cycle to 3, and the second number would be for each stable release.<p>So yeah, 2.2-2.4 was about 2 years between new stable versions. 2.4-2.6 was about 3 years between new stable versions. But then there have been new stable versions about once every 2-3 months, and new long term supported versions picked from those about once a year (for distributions which prefer to do long-term support on a single kernel version, rather than updating to the latest stable).",1373936161

Everyone looks forward to the day when designing a font doesn&#x27;t mean spending half your time hinting for those pesky ~85ppi displays, but we&#x27;re off to a pretty slow start.

6049405,comment,6046682,6048013,3,0,mjn,,,"Wow, this looks great. My ideal cloud-computing platform is basically something like xargs -P or GNU parallel, but with the illusion that I&#x27;m running it on a machine with infinite CPU cores and RAM (charged for usage, of course). I was spoiled early on by having once had something <i>almost</i> like that, via a very nice university compute cluster, where your data was always available on all nodes (via NFS), and you just prefixed your usual Unix commands with a job-submit command, which did the magic of transparently running stuff wherever it wanted to run it. Apart from the slight indirection of using the job-submit tool, it almost succeeded in giving the illusion of ssh-ing into a single gazillion-core big-iron machine, which is more or less the user experience I want. But I haven&#x27;t found a commercial offering where I can get an account on a big Unix cluster and just get billed for some function of my (disk space, CPU usage, RAM usage) x time.<p>Cloud services are amazing in a lot of ways, but so far I&#x27;ve found them much more heavyweight for the use-case of running ad-hoc jobs from the Unix command line. You don&#x27;t really want to write Hadoop code for exploratory data analysis, and even managing a little fleet of bashreduce+EC2 instances that get spun up and down on demand is error-prone and tedious, turning me more into the cluster <i>administrator</i> rather than a user, which is what I&#x27;d rather be. Admittedly it&#x27;s possible that could be abstracted out better in the case where you don&#x27;t mind latency: I often don&#x27;t mind if my jobs queue up for a few minutes, which would mean a tool could spin up EC2 instances behind the scenes and then tear them down without me noticing. But I haven&#x27;t found anything that does that transparently yet, and Manta looks like a more direct implementation of the &quot;illusion of running on an N-core machine for arbitrary N&quot; idea that seems in the same cost ballpark. Definitely going to do some experimentation here, to see if 2010s technology will enable me to keep using a 1970s-era data-processing workflow.",1373935214

6049391,comment,6048092,6049118,5,0,pindi,,,"Not quite. The essence of a double-spend attack is creating two transactions spending the same bitcoin: one to the merchant (call it A) and one to another of your accounts (call it B). You send A to the merchant and secretly submit B to another node. A looks valid to the merchant, so they accept it.<p>Now it&#x27;s basically a 50-50 chance of which transaction will make it into the ledger and which will be rejected as invalid because the input was already spent. If you have your own compute power, you can shift this, up to the extreme of having >50% of the total power, in which case you can guarantee B is accepted, since you can outmine any chain that includes A. However, there is no reason you would need to forfeit any reward if you personally mine the block with the transaction in it.<p>Confirmations shift the probabilities back towards the merchant, since no honest node will mine on a chain not already including A because the one including A is longer. In this case you must mine secretly on the chain including B until it exceeds the length of the chain including A. This absolutely requires more than 50% of the network compute power, since you must totally outmine the honest network. But again, if you can get the length of chain B up to the point where it exceeds chain A, the block rewards in chain B are yours and those in chain A are forfeit.",1373934849

The same icon area might be 60x60 on a phone, so it&#x27;ll chose the 64x64 and downsample that one a bit to fit 60x60.<p>I haven&#x27;t done much iOS programming, but from what I understand it works pretty much the same except the sizes are more fixed at 1x/2x/4x because there is less DPI variation across iOS devices.<p>This way has downsides (makes the assets larger since you have multiple copies of each one), but generally works pretty well in practice and actually works better than vectors for some things (though vectors can scale up and down at will, if they aren&#x27;t heavily &#x27;hinted&#x27; you can easily lose important details that you don&#x27;t want to lose at small sizes, with pre-rendered bitmaps you can adjust for this ahead of time).",1373934434

For instance, you could store the ASCII symbols in an integer array:<p><pre><code>  int array = { ... } // holds the source code,
                      //  except its own representation

  int array_index; // The index in the source code
                   // (where the actual integers in
                   // array interpreted as source appear)

  for i = 0 to array_index:
    print (array[i] as an ASCII character)

  for i = 0 to array_length:
    print (array[i] as integer ++ &quot;, &quot;)

  for i = array_index + 1 to array_length:
    print (array[i] as an ASCII character)

The core idea is that you can interpret `array` in two ways, as an array of integers or an array of ascii characters representing the program source.  The only difficult part is adjusting array_index.  With a little effort, this can be scaled to a chain of languages.",1373933814

6049335,comment,6048993,6048993,36,0,softbuilder,,,"Personal history for anyone suffering from serious anxiety:<p>Anxiety destroyed my 20s. It kept me home-bound. I rarely went out and would have attacks at the grocery store all of the time. Early on I hoped that things would come to a head and that I would eventually be immune to it, and stronger for it. But that never happened. I was afraid to seek help because I assumed they&#x27;d put me on meds that would dull my thinking. Looking back, that probably would have been fine. At every turn anxiety held me back. A stupider but freer me would have been welcome.<p>After a lot of self-analysis and experimentation I discovered that about 70% of the problem was the Pepsi I was slugging down every day. For my body, sugar and caffeine together are like crack. I switched to diet and dropped about half of my daily anxiety in a few months. I eventually cut the caffeine out altogether. Daily anxiety almost entirely dropped, with occasional spikes for stressful situations. A friend told me to look into choline. I&#x27;m not a supplements guy, but it turns out eggs have plenty so I started eating eggs every morning. I also started running which has had a huge impact on my mood. After a while I rarely had anxiety. In fact most of the anxiety was from worrying that I was going to have an anxiety attack. I&#x27;m not cured - I don&#x27;t like certain situations and those can still bring out an attack. The good news is that it&#x27;s now at a point where I can fight back and &quot;be brave&quot;, which I always though would fix it but never did. That actually works most of the time now. That was just impossible in the past.<p>I used to think that caffeine was making me smarter. It was definitely giving me bursts of ideas, but ultimately it didn&#x27;t give me anything I wasn&#x27;t going to have already. I was abusing a drug, not thoughtfully taking a medication.<p>I basically had to become enraged at how my life was going in order to do something about it.<p>The bottom line is to never stop trying to solve it.

The key is to realize that logic doesn&#x27;t drive behavior. Rather, people do what comes naturally  i.e. that which is habitual  and then rationalize it as needed. The rationalization process is very strong. Logic is a mere speedbump on that road.<p>The only time people think carefully through a course of action is if they have no habits to fall back on.<p>People pirate music because they&#x27;re habituated to think of music as free. The training process has been going on longer than digital music has existed, actually.<p>Which brings me to my observation that, of all the many dying forms of media, recorded music feels especially screwed. Yes, people pirate movies, books, and software, but somehow things seem a lot more dire among the poor musicians. Why is that?<p>I wonder if it&#x27;s just a perfect storm of coincidence. So many things about recorded pop music make it extra-susceptible to piracy.<p>* Until recently, music was designed to be learned and performed by other people. That was the only way to hear it more than once. So not only is there a centuries-old tradition of performing other people&#x27;s music, but there&#x27;s techniques and instruments based on that art and schools to teach you how.<p>People often did this by ear. There&#x27;s a story about Allegri&#x27;s <i>Miserere</i>, the subject of the most famous act of music piracy in history: The <i>Miserere</i> was the personal property of the Pope, and would-be copyists of the work were threatened with excommunication. For 150 years it was only performed in the Sistine Chapel during Holy Week. Then Mozart came to town at age 14, heard the piece at the Wednesday service, went back to his room and <i>wrote the whole thing down from memory</i>, came back on Friday night to listen again and make minor corrections, and gave the transcript away to be published.<p><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miserere_(Allegri)"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miserere_(Allegri)</a><p>It may seem obvious, but if we took any modern Mozart to see <i>Pacific Rim</i> no amount of talent would enable him to produce a reasonable cover version in a day. It would take a year and hundreds of millions of dollars. Memorizing and recopying a novel is much more achievable, but the result would not be impressive except as a stunt: It&#x27;s culturally understood that novels are intended to be printed verbatim, not reinterpreted or &quot;covered&quot;, and it would be clear to everyone that the copied version was &quot;plagiarism&quot;, not an homage or an interpretation. And many people are literally <i>blind</i> to features of a novel&#x27;s &quot;performance&quot;, such as its typesetting or the quality of its paper.<p>Novels were born in the age of cheap printing and are adapted to it. I predict that we will soon evolve genres of music that are similarly adapted to the era of cheap copying. It&#x27;s not a difficult prediction, because the selection pressure that will drive this trend is starkly obvious.<p>* It&#x27;s human nature to repeat the music that one hears. You can&#x27;t stop humming. Often even if you <i>want</i> to.<p>* There&#x27;s a tradition going back nearly a century of <i>pretending</i> that music is free: Music on the radio, and Muzak in stores. Of course, this music is all subsidized, but people don&#x27;t think about that, if they even know.<p>If I were David Lowery and someone handed me a time machine and a gun, of course I&#x27;d probably go back and shoot Hitler, like you do. But then I&#x27;d hunt down the inventor of Muzak. Because after two generations of being <i>marinated</i> in free music it&#x27;s no wonder people are habituated to think that music is free-as-in-oxygen.<p>* Pop music&#x27;s designers spent half a century promoting a culture of repeat listening, in order to encourage everyone to buy singles. So we&#x27;re trained to think of pop songs as something you <i>collect</i>, then listen to over and over. And we know that the best pop songs are the ones that are being heavily promoted, because being able to play &quot;the latest single&quot; is a fashion statement, even today.<p>Repeat-consumption of media is not some kind of natural law, it&#x27;s genre-specific. I&#x27;m a big re-reader, but I think I&#x27;m an odd case: The majority of people read books only once, which explains why, even if they do read, they don&#x27;t have a house full of books. Pauline Kael wrote about movies for a living, but never watched a movie more than once. And I have a huge Pinboard log of bookmarks, but I essentially never revisit them.<p>And, now that the money&#x27;s been sucked out of the market for &quot;original&quot; recordings by the &quot;original artists&quot;, there&#x27;s no reason why musical culture should continue to encourage playing the same thing twice. Many genres don&#x27;t: &quot;Never the same way twice&quot; pretty much <i>defines</i> jazz. (Unfortunately, jazz also evolved in an era awash with talented, classically-trained club and theater musicians, who eventually ran out of gigs because recording had been invented. The present and future of jazz is hip-hop and club music, built of improvised rhythm and rhyme instead of improvised melody and harmony, and of sampled recordings instead of sampled melodies and progressions.)",1373933689

The problem is that app developers have historically been completely deficient in this regard; in practice they either hard-code pixel-perfect layouts (but don&#x27;t lock the font sizes, so text gets cut off), or half-ass it and get the DPI scaling completely wrong by starting to implement it and then stopping. It has literally been possible for Win32 applications to do <i>everything</i> that a OSX/iOS Retina application does <i>since 1995</i>. This feature was even supported in <i>Visual Basic</i>!<p>In Windows Vista, Microsoft responded to this by adding a new system where unless an application explicitly told the window manager &#x27;yes, I&#x27;m actually DPI aware&#x27;, the window manager assumes that the app will completely muck up DPI scaling, and it renders to a lower-resolution window buffer and scales it up so that text/object sizes are appropriate for your display DPI. Despite this, there are still applications that tell the window manager &#x27;I&#x27;m DPI aware!!!&#x27; when they&#x27;re not. Note that this scaler uses an actual scaling algorithm, unlike Apple&#x27;s nearest-neighbor, so text scaled up in this fashion remains perfectly readable (albeit blurry), unlike the complete mess Apple turns Cleartype text into.<p>In practice the problem here is ENTIRELY developers and consumers, not Microsoft. Consumers buy (and continue to buy) displays that have resolutions that are not an even integral multiple of some other display resolution, and continue to buy applications that are not correctly DPI aware. Developers respond to this by continuing to ship broken applications that don&#x27;t respond correctly to display DPI.<p>Microsoft could do whatever they wanted, including directly mirroring Apple&#x27;s approach, and none of this would change.<p>Apple&#x27;s approach only works because they have a complete monopoly on their platform and they use it to force developers to waste resources on whatever changes they introduce - a new approach to DPI awareness and rendering that requires introducing 2x versions of all your UI bitmaps, a new sandboxing mechanism and app store that requires it, a new UI toolkit, new font rendering APIs, etc. Usually Apple at least uses this power to improve things for consumers, but it&#x27;s naive to look at how Apple handled the Retina transition and say &#x27;if only Microsoft had done that too&#x27; - the Retina transition was incredibly expensive for developers and continues to be expensive for end-users (by making shipped applications larger and potentially slower and definitely more complex).<p>Don&#x27;t even get me started on the blatant stupidity Apple&#x27;s approach to Retina introduced into HTML5/Canvas/WebGL. getImageDataHD and devicePixelRatio, hurray!",1373933140

I guarantee that as well as taking the process through the courts, they have also been obeying the existing law.  They have no choice.<p>&quot;Are you suggesting that if in the event of a CEO or shareholders of multinational corporations deciding not to comply with secret orders then they will be labeled by the state to the public as terrorists and national security threats?&quot;<p>or child molesters, or rapists, or tax fraudsters, or anything that can be found and has the smallest chance of sticking.
There is a pretty good history of this, including Assange, and the CEO of some telco whose name I forget.  It is a pretty standard way for Intelligence departmentsto get what they want, see the history of intelligence companies.<p>The NSA have access to all our communications, finding something to use as blackmail isn&#x27;t going to be hard.<p>&quot;If one needs the populace at large in order to discern whether the actions undertaken by the state or any of it&#x27;s outsourced entities are reprehensible or not, they we have bigger problems at hand&quot;<p>we honestly do.

6049293,comment,6043183,6045182,1,0,bigiain,,,"Yeah, but he whole &quot;pervasive surveillance&quot; thing means there&#x27;s no meatspace equivalent of Perfect Forward Security here. It only takes _one_ instance where someone can map my MAC address to an identity for the entire recorded chain to lose it&#x27;s anonymity - one venue &quot;in the system&quot; where I make a credit card purchase or divulge my identity. Hell - if we&#x27;re being paranoid, a sufficiently determined wifi access point operator has a _lot_ at their disposal to attempt to de-anonymise a specific phone. iOS for example under some conditions transmits the MAC addresses of the last 3 access points its connected to. There&#x27;s a reasonably high chance on of them&#x27;s my home and/or work wifi - use some tool that&#x27;ll sniff all those ARP requests and geolocate them[1] to get partial address data. A determined enough attacker might be snooping any traffic that the phone puts through the network. Using non SSL protected POP3 or IMAP - guess who&#x27;s got your email address (and password!)? Does your Twitter/InstaGram/Pintrest/4Square/SnapChat/whatever client always use SSL? Are ay of them vulnerable to sslstrip or MITM-able with unsigned certs? How many websites does your phone browser happily send unencrypted cookies to that&#x27;re capable of providing strong hints to your identity? (Even HN did this up to a few months ago. &quot;superuser2&quot; doesn&#x27;t reveal much about you, but knowing I&#x27;m &quot;bigiain&quot; in HN is enough to uniquely identify me.)<p>Now you&#x27;ve got me wondering just how many of the widespread free wifi rollouts are relying on this as part of their monetisation. McDonalds free wifi would be a great network to do this on. My local shopping center free wifi is almost certainly run by the same company as all of the othe AMP Capital shopping centers in Australia. And now that I think about it, they&#x27;re pushing the center wifi hard, with things like Pinterest promotions and &quot;like us on Facebook&quot; and &quot;download our iPhone app&quot; - all things that could easily deanonymise my MAC address...<p>[1] <a href=""https://github.com/hubert3/iSniff-GPS"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/hubert3/iSniff-GPS</a>",1373932913

4060093,comment,4058818,4059807,9,0,kens,,,"I think you're hitting on an important point by discussing different types of conversations. My theory (based on many years of Usenet) is that there are three basic types of online participants: ""cocktail party"", ""scientific conference"", and ""debate team"". In ""cocktail party"", the participants are having an entertaining conversation and sharing anecdotes. In ""scientific conference"", the participants are trying to increase knowledge and solve problems. In ""debate team"", the participants are trying to prove their point is right.<p>HN was originally largely in the ""scientific conference"" mode, with very smart people discussing areas in which they were experts. Now HN has much more ""cocktail party"" flavor, with smart people chatting about random things they often know little about. And certain subjects (e.g. economics, Apple, sexism, piracy) bring out the ""debate team"" commenters.<p>Any of the three types can carry on happily by themself. However, much of the problem comes when the types of conversation mix. The ""cocktail party"" conversations will annoy the ""scientific conference"" readers, since half of what they say is wrong. Conversely, the ""scientific conference"" commenters come across as pedantic when they interrupt a fun conversation with facts or ""citation needed"". A conversation between ""debate team"" and one of the other groups obviously goes nowhere.<p>I think the comment karma in HN encourages ""cocktail party"" conversation since you're as likely to get upvoted for trivial chitchat as a carefully-reasoned expert statement. (See <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/bestcomments"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/bestcomments</a>) Also, as I just found out, ""expired link"" on HN encourages quick comments rather than slowly written ones.<p>(And yes, I realize the irony that this is a ""cocktail party"" style comment of with my random opinion. I've actually considered ways of making this categorization quantitative, but it would take way too much time.)",1338699263

While their is provision for tamper resistant receptacles in the 2009 IRC, many jurisdictions have remained on older versions of that code because the 2009 edition requires fire sprinklers in single family homes and therefore its adoption creates substantial political tension between building departments and the homebuilders whose fees fund those departments.<p>To put it another way, in the US, tamper resistant receptacles are not required in any non-residential structure, and because codes are adopted at the local or state level on an ad hoc basis, many dwellings are not required to conform with NEC 2008 or later versions.<p>Think of new editions of building codes like Windows, lots of people still use XP.",1338698684

Why is that?<p>It must be for the same reason that an electric shock from an ungrounded AC circuit doesn't travel through your feet as the article mention.<p>But I'm having difficulties understanding this concept. My (admittedly naive) understanding of electricity is that when one terminal has <i>more electrons</i> than another you can wire both terminals to a light bulb and it will light up. i.e. electron travel through the light bulb from one terminal to the other.<p>If my understanding was correct it would mean that one terminal from the input circuit of the isolation transformer (the neutral wire and the ground it is connected to) would always have the same <i>number of electrons</i> than either terminal of the transformer output.<p>Since the reason we have an isolation transformer is to prevent electrons from traveling between the transformer output and the ground, both outputs and the ground need to have the same number of electron. i.e. zero voltage.

4060057,comment,4052827,4057888,1,0,koeselitz,,,"Yes, the purpose of RAID is not to fail silently; but it's hardware, and hardware can be flawed. That's just a fact. There are different levels of RAID precisely because there are different levels of redundancy - that is, different extents to which the possibility of failure is minimized. No hardware is flawless, though.<p>Please note that I have not said ""it is likely to fail"" or ""you should expect that it will probably fail."" I agree that it shouldn't be something that keeps a person up at night. But the simple fact is that, when data is important, you should prepare for that possibility (and others) by backing up. RAID does not solve all problems, and it is not guaranteed, as unlikely as failure might be.<p>Moreover - in saying that it simply isn't RAID if it ever fails silently, you're attempting to define away a nonsemantic problem. The point of a starter motor on a car is to start the engine. If the starter motor fails to start the engine, I guess I could make an Aristotelian argument that it has ceased to be a starter motor, or even perhaps that it was never a starter motor in the first place.

It complements (as opposed to competing against) offerings such as Boost and of course std. In fact, we embark on defining our own component only when something we need is either not available, or does not meet the needed performance profile.<p>Performance concerns permeate much of Folly, sometimes leading to designs that are more idiosyncratic than they would otherwise be (see e.g. PackedSyncPtr.h, SmallLocks.h). Good performance at large scale is a unifying theme in all of Folly.",1338696982

Why hasn't it been eliminated or reformed by now?<p>Because the goal of TSA is not to get a rid of terrorism or truly make you or me be safer; they are in business of making money and trying to make you _feel_ safer.<p>Dealing with Federal agencies on different levels (once I was very close to suing director of FBI; had writ of mandamus almost finished, but family forced me out of it) over last 8 years, I will tell you just like outside government, also inside government there are agencies more or less sinister. For years now it was CIA with infamous drug trafficking and prostitution, but comparing to good ole days, those are the good guys now. TSA is in business of scaring people because its like any other business - it wants to make money.",1338696929

However, on days when the winds are light or unusual, it can be more favorable to take a more Southern route which also avoids the additional overflight fees from Canada and the US.  The route being flown today is comparable distance to the Northern/Canada route, although it appears significantly more direct due to flat projections of a curved Earth.  The flight duration today is about the same as the last couple weeks, which suggest they&#x27;re taking this routing due to winds/overflight fees.  The last two times we saw this flight take a similar route were June 20 and June 8.<p>On the route it&#x27;s flying today, it will fly in US airspace; the US controls most of the Western half of the North Atlantic. To actually avoid US airspace, a flight from Moscow to Havana would likely have to fly South to (approximately) Western Sahara and then West, which would be about 30% further than either of the routings discussed above.",1373576206

This isn&#x27;t going to change for a long time.<p>Something else is dying - the traditional licensing model for software. Software is becoming a cheap commodity, due to open-source, due to the freemium model on the web, due to piracy, due to the $0.99 or ads-enabled apps that are so popular lately.<p>By contrast, there&#x27;s been a lot of innovation in hardware / devices. Skipping over the obvious innovations, like smart-phones with touch-screens, for example Samsung&#x27;s Chromebook is amazing - a good looking ultra-portable with good battery, that does 90% of what people need and that&#x27;s so cheap that you can replace it should you break or lose it.<p>Let&#x27;s think about what the Chromebook is, because it&#x27;s fascinating - all the apps you run on it are web apps. The just released Firefox OS does the same thing and I&#x27;m sure it&#x27;s going to be a success. Apple themselves, before releasing their iPhone SDK, were telling devs to build web apps.<p>So where is Microsoft in this picture? Nowhere. Their empire is built on Windows and Office and without these in the picture they are fucked. And they can&#x27;t rely on the current PC market for upgrades, because PCs are more than good enough, so people don&#x27;t feel the need for upgrades, unless they buy based on sex-appeal. Many companies are still on Windows XP and Office 2003.<p>This isn&#x27;t a &quot;<i>Post PC</i>&quot; era. This is the &quot;<i>Web Era</i>&quot;. Furthermore, all the mobile app stores are just passing fads.",1373575656

6029010,comment,6025999,6028213,1,0,SapphireSun,,,"I do agree that it may cause some inflation (I&#x27;m not sure how much). I don&#x27;t think those computations are correct though (3/16 = 18.75, not 25 for example). Inflation is measured as the cost for a basket of goods. Simply giving lots of people more money would not change the cost structure immediately. It would provide a larger consumer pool that companies can compete to server. The effects are complex and it&#x27;s not immediately clear that inflation would spike to sky high levels, though a rise in inflation does occur when there is more trade because people are getting higher wages. A little bit of inflation is a positive indicator.<p>However, redistributing definitely does have an economic effect because richer people has an increase propensity to save. When you take 10k that they weren&#x27;t using and give it to someone poor, that money starts flowing immediately. An analogy would be something like, say you have a lake with some water seeping out from a small waterfall.

Python differentiates itself from similar languages in the niche by elevating simplicity, explicitness, and readability over conciseness and expressiveness.

The Social Security cap is $113,700, and the Social Security tax is levied on all income below this.  The individual standard deduction is $6100 and the personal exemption is $3900.<p>That means that for an individual, a 28% income tax rate means income is above $97,850 while paying Social security taxes means income is below $113,700.  I sort of doubt this covers &quot;most people&quot;.<p>For a couple, the 28% bracket starts at $146,400 taxable, the standard deduction is $12,200, and personal exemptions are $7,800.  So in this case the rate you quote applies to income over $166,400 and below $227,400 if both members of the couple have equal salaries.  Again, hardly &quot;most people&quot;.<p>Finding good numbers on this is hard, but  <a href=""http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20101119053457AA2Anap"" rel=""nofollow"">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20101119053457AA...</a> suggest that somewhere around 46% of taxpayers fall in the 10% or 15% brackets, and that&#x27;s ignoring the effects of EITC and whatnot....<p>Of course the 15% bracket definitely has a marginal rate of 23% or so, again ignoring EITC and various other tax credits you can claim at those income levels that phase out with income, since they&#x27;re certainly paying FICA at that point.<p>> investments are only taxed at a flat 15%<p>It really depends.  Dividends are sometimes taxed at this rate and sometimes at your normal income rate, depending on whether they&#x27;re qualified or not.  Capital gains are, if you hold long enough.  And capital gains can, of course, still affect your AMT exemption, meaning that if you&#x27;re in the the AMT phaseout range your marginal rate on even long-term capital gains is about 22% (15% + 25%*28%, since the phaseout applies to normal income).<p>Of course once you make so much money that the AMT becomes irrelevant your marginal rate on capital gains drops back down to 15%.",1373574330

First I looked at Pyskein, Java skein and all the other implementations released by pros. Then I looked at everything the authors who submitted other NIST3 finalists wrote, blogged and argued about on mailing lists. Then I read about the android SHA-1 design decisions. Then I watched lectures on crypto software engineering. Then I looked up everything about accelerometer side channels, PRNGs problems and gotchas, Moxies blog posts, and his yaffs source he used for whispercore, and went through tons of Dos and Dont comments both here and on Schneier&#x27;s blogs about writing secure software. Then I watched BSDcon coding the openbsd secure way, and talked with maintainers who implement crypto on the openbsd mailing list.<p>Result is SHA3 full disk for Android.

This isn&#x27;t just a matter of concision: coming up with descriptive names is hard, and usually means duplicated information, either in the name or the type declaration. Often, those names are re-used over and over again with subtly different meanings, for each stage in a pipeline--forcing the reader to reason carefully about the declaring scope at each use.<p>Consider, for example:<p><pre><code>  Swimmer swimmer = new Swimmer(&quot;foo&quot;);\n  swimmer.setStyle(&quot;butterfly&quot;);\n  swimmer.swim();\n  return swimmer;\n\n  (doto (Swimmer. foo)\n        (.setStyle &quot;butterfly&quot;)\n        .swim)\n</code></pre>\nSame operation--but with (doto), four uses of a variable and one type declaration have been cleared away. Consider the original post:<p><pre><code>  var words = s.Split(&#x27; &#x27;);\n  var wordCounts = words.GroupBy(x => x).Select(x => new { Name = x.Key, Count = x.Count() }).OrderByDescending(x => x.Count);  \n  var countedWords = wordCounts.Select(x => x.Name).Take(10).ToList();\n  return ExtractTopTen(countedWords);\n</code></pre>\nSix uses of three formal variables, including the bewilderingly confusable countedWords and wordCounts, plus nine uses of the delightfully generic &quot;x&quot;. Even in the more compact C# example from this thread, consider:<p><pre><code>  var top = (from w in text.Split(&#x27; &#x27;) \n             group w by w into g \n             orderby g.Count() descending \n             select g.Key).Take(10);\n</code></pre>\nThis variant refers to the temporary variables w (for &quot;words&quot;) and g (for &quot;groups&quot;?) <i>six times</i>. Both authors felt the need to reduce the repetition of variables, but the best they could do was to choose single-character names.<p>This is the real power of ->, .., ->>, doto, and friends: eliminating names for things. By thinking about the composition of transformations, instead of the intermediate results, you can make an algorithm easier to understand and change.",1373573689

It likely came out of Danny Sullivan&#x27;s letter to the FTC[2] showing how the competitors accusing Google Shopping of not disclosing paid inclusion well enough had no intention of themselves following the FTC&#x27;s rules.<p>> The difference is that the negative Microsoft news tends to float on top of sites like HN more than positive news, and the reverse is true for Google so this alters perceptions of people.<p>You clearly visit a different HN than I do. While there is plenty of positive Google news here, the negative news in the top 10 is almost daily (Reader, account closing, PRISM, etc). Considering your account is 6 hours old (with 196 karma!), maybe stick around for a while before making pseudo-hypotheses about story dynamics?<p>[1] <a href=""http://searchengineland.com/ftc-search-engine-disclosure-164722"" rel=""nofollow"">http://searchengineland.com/ftc-search-engine-disclosure-164...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://searchengineland.com/a-letter-to-the-ftc-regarding-search-engine-disclosure-124169"" rel=""nofollow"">http://searchengineland.com/a-letter-to-the-ftc-regarding-se...</a>",1373572981

The procedure specifically allows API requests and monitoring immediately and providing the orders in some-week time or if the order doesn&#x27;t come &quot;destroying&quot; the obtained data that aren&#x27;t metadata. Metadata can always remain because they are considered &quot;public&quot; in the current up-to-recently secret law interpretations.

Or those who go undiagnosed with a condition despite having a primary care physician? What about those folks with a disability that makes it difficult for them to access health care?

7010887,comment,7008955,7008955,1,0,codeoclock,,,"I&#x27;ve also been programming since I was about 10. I remember doing some Logo stuff, I recently just found a zip drive with my first program - Tic Tac Toe in logo. I certainly don&#x27;t remember being encouraged to program until I was at the very least 17 when I was in high school being taught some bullshit &#x27;computer ethics&#x27; course by a man with a PhD in Computer Science who just wanted to show people how to code. I guess I&#x27;m saying, the encouragement factor for any young programmer is very low, and should be much better. It sounds to me from reading this blog post that it was harder for you, possibly (probably?) because you&#x27;re a woman. That really sucks, it shouldn&#x27;t be harder, it should be equally hard for women and men, and it should be getting easier for both all the time. That&#x27;s why things like Code Club and various online ways of learning programming are so important in my opinion. When programming is put on the curriculum at school, parents are more likely to take it seriously rather than act like my parents who tried to stop me using the computer.

7010881,comment,7010449,7010449,1,0,einhverfr,,,"One of the things I have often noted is how theories which don&#x27;t match reality very well often trump reality in terms of explanations.  For example, TCP/IP is a 4-layer network stack, while the OSI model is 7 layers.  These models are <i>fundamentally different</i> and understanding the <i>differences</i> is often key to understanding design decisions for OSI protocols ported to TCP/IP (H.323 being a good example).<p>But people talk as if TCP/IP follows the OSI model.  It doesn&#x27;t.  Often understanding that it doesn&#x27;t and why it doesn&#x27;t is a good first step to understanding why it works the way it does.  So that is top of my list.<p>THere are other issues.  For example, when another techie is speaking gobbldiegook, it is way too easy to project meaning onto what is said so that misunderstandings develop.  For example, I have written frameworks for building object frameworks.  These are not object factory factories (but rather services to offer object frameworks, for example generalized service locator API&#x27;s for locating stored procedures, allowing a looser coupling than most people have).  However, when someone says &quot;its an object factory factory&quot; very often the simplest response is &quot;well, sort of, if you are the factory worker!&quot;",1388839334

7010814,comment,7010000,7010000,1,0,shadowmint,,,"Worth noting that the syntax example is slightly incorrect.<p>Since go auto-postpends ; to lines, you must have a trailing . on the line to allow the compiler to consider multiline statements like this as multiline statements instead of multiple (syntactically incorrect) single statements.<p>I presume this is just done for readability in the docs, but it&#x27;s a little misleading. Correctly, it would be:<p><pre><code>    over18Names, err := From(students).  // <--- Notice the trailing . to prevent ;\n    Where(func (s T) (bool,error){\n        return s.(*Student).age >= 18, nil\n    }).\n    Select(func (s T) (T,error){\n        return s.(*Student).name, nil\n    }).\n    Results()\n</code></pre>\nIt&#x27;s argued now and then that this is one of the reasons go isn&#x27;t useful for chain expression libraries like this; it becomes hard to tell at a glance the difference between two consecutive statements and one chained long statement.<p>(The other reason typically given is it breaks error return expectations, but whatever.

4390350,comment,4388339,4388618,1,0,mkramlich,,,"Fact: he has not been accused of rape. He has not been charged with rape. There is no trial. There are no charges. And there are no witnesses, and no physical evidence.<p>And if you read up on the details of the story, and the context, it's very fishy. It's at best a case of he-said vs she-said --- arguably one of the perfect ways to smear someone's reputation and cause them legal and financial hassle, without having to meet the minimum legal standards to convict someone of guilt beyond all reasonable doubt. Men and women have sex ALL the time, 24/7, all across the world, in all sorts of complex ways, variations, situations, and very often without condoms. It's also a fact that a large percentage of women like men to be dominant with them and it arouses them.<p>Given all these facts, and this cultural context, it's hard to know exactly what happened behind closed doors in these incidents, and before the legal system ruins a man's life they need to be damn sure they're doing the right thing. From just what's known publicly so far this case looks so flaky and muddled and suspicious that a reasonable person could easily say those standards aren't met here.",1345103934

4390341,comment,4389691,4390125,2,0,phao,,,"One major problem, which I think is related to this you're saying is that C is used as if it was a beginner's language, but it isn't.<p>C was made so that it could be simply compiled to assembly. Also important, it had high portability ""in mind"". The mix of these two design goals is that compilers could exist for many platforms. And not just that, it's a language that was made also so that a large part of the UNIX operating system could be re-written in.<p>As some additional, although you can interpret C, that's not how it's usually used. In teaching/learning, people use optimizing (professional) compilers such as GCC. Which leads to a much non-interactive environment.<p>Put these 2 design goals together and you're bound to realize a language which is not beginner friendly because lots of things are there, or not, for reasons (a) to help the compiler writers; (b) due to portability on some machine of the 70's or 80's; and (c) of being a language for OS development. Add this with the fact that the tools around the language are not so interactice, you get something really beginner unfriendly.<p>C is not simple to learn, to use or to get good at. Compilers take advantage of what was put in the standard in very bizarre ways. Which means that if your code is wrong, even a little bit, it's likely that you get bugs, terrible ones. The optimizing compilers (good for professional use; bad for leaning) are usually the ones which will lead to the strangests bugs. Again, not beginner friendly.<p>It's often that people think they're good at C, and that they write portable C code: 
they usually are not and don't. C is very good at deceiving people.<p>Unfortunately, C is not a language that you can just pick and start solving your problem right away. Many more ordinary statements can fail for non-obvious reasons, which is not so common in other languages.<p>I am not implying that you don't know all this. I am though, implying that you should take this into consideration when you talk about learning C, and beginner programmers approaching C, and even beginners in C from other languages.<p>There are good books which are not difficult, and do not let go of preciseness, like K&R2.",1345103699

That doesn't mean that it's an automatic winner for Fab, but there are many other ways that ToM could have designed the site.<p>> the design elements can't serve a utilitarian purpose<p>When courts use ""functional purpose"" in the trade dress context, they usually mean things like product features that make the product work.  For example, courts have ruled that things like the physical design of a conveyor belt can't be protected as trade dress (the ""Value Engineering"" case). I'm not sure that design elements that highlight certain information are ""functional"" in the way that a conveyor belt design is ""functional.""<p>That said, it might not matter: in the ""Clicks Billiards"" case (2001), the Ninth Circuit held that a _combination_ of functional elements can be protected as trade dress: there, the combination of 37 elements of a billiards hall design were held to be eligible for protection even though some were undeniably functional (the presence of acoustic tiling on parts of the walls and a certain style of ""drink rails"") and some were pretty generic in isolation (one was ""dark mahogany wood finishes"").  The court ruled that the combination could still be protected.  It looks like Fab is trying to make a similar argument here that the combination adds up to being too similar.

That didn't stop it being very enjoyable, and Forged Alliance was a decent expansion too, but the endless crashes just as large-scale games were moving into full swing got old.<p>Also, the strategic zoom was a mixed blessing. It was a great idea, but what's the point of having fine unit control and gorgeous graphics in the game if you have to spend 95% of your time playing general rather than sergeant, zoomed out to global icon view? At higher tech levels and on larger maps, that was almost essential, so you could see a wave of tech 3 attack units or an experimental coming in time to do something about it because the defensive units at higher tech levels didn't keep up with the offensive ones.<p>IMHO Supreme Commander was a game that genuinely deserved descriptions like ""epic"", but it was far from perfect and there would be plenty of scope for a modern game to learn from what it did well but perhaps take a fresh look at things like strategic vs. tactical control and providing a flexible economy that created options but without requiring micromanagement of resource generation and unit building.",1345102081

Casting is ugly, error prone, and conceals errors.  Don't do it, there is no need.  If you think it is helping you because you can see what type things are then your functions are too large and incoherent, fix that problem instead.<p>- ""Here we print out the values of our uninitialized and NULL pointers. Notice that our uninitialized pointer has a memory location"" - This behaviour is completely undefined and it is doing injustice to those who would benefit from this blog post.  All code people run on an example site should be well-defined.  ""Worst case the program crashes badly"" - No, worst case is you have no idea what could happen!  Old versions of gcc ran nethack when it detected undefined behaviour at compile time.  In practice, crashing is actually the best case since you can see the error.  In worst case it silently corrupts data in your program and you can't find it until it's so far from the error site that it's near impossible to track down.<p>- ""using the NULL keyword"" - NULL is not a keyword, it's a macro defined in stddef.h (maybe stdlib.h? I forget).<p>- ""doing so will cause a segmentation fault"" - No, it's undefined behaviour.  On DOS systems the memory addresses 0 was valid and writable.<p>- ""That being said an array variable does point to the memory address of the first element of the array."" - No, it IS the first element.  It decays to a pointer to its first element under various operations, though.<p>- ""char * fullname = ""full name"";"" - const char * .  Modifying string literals is undefined and the fact that the compiler does not require fullname to be a const char * is merely a historic oversight.<p>I understand the desire to learn-by-writing, but I don't feel this tutorial offers much to the discussion and confuses some of the same things the many other pointer tutorials confuse.

87868,comment,87531,87609,0,0,sanj,,,"Not doing it can lead to email hijacking:<p>Consider someone signing up with my email address: foo@bar.com. Now I'm not going to be able to use that email address, because it is already taken. Worse, if messages to that account, such as invitations, the attacker can accept them, since they typically see the invitations on the site in addition to it being sent to the email address.<p>As the legit user, I might see the invites, but won't be able to log in at all. Worse things can happen: once the attacker signs up, they could make this email address secondary and add another, primary address so that they see all of the messages.",1197309211

- A short cut syntax to declare getters and setters.

87859,comment,87558,87710,0,0,gduffy,,,"So if ""happy"" == ""completely happy"", it's somewhere around $2E6 for me. Enough interest to cover the basics so I can work on anything I like. Anything after that is just icing on the cake, and it's still fun whether I win or lose (the bills are already taken care of).<p>I imagine answers to this question vary wildly, but tend to cluster around 3 points: $0, something like my rough calculation, and some large-ish percentage of the GDP.",1197308281

87857,comment,87849,87849,0,0,streblo,,,"Pretty cool puzzle. I've never seen this game before. Its a nice procrastination tool while studying for finals. The only comment I have is that if you change the value of a row/column, it changes the row/column's size, and in turn changes the size of the puzzle. You should make row and column size universal regardless of what number is in it.",1197308149
87856,comment,87707,87824,0,0,davidw,,,"What you might consider doing, if you don't agree with the economics, is point out the errors in my logic rather than continue to attack my understanding of economics (which is an awfully broad conclusion to reach from a few comments in any case, I might add).  And included in that, for the sake of discussing the economics, is that CO2 emissions are in some way harmful, even if you don't happen to believe that.",1197307983

The amount of work required to go from a B to an A was very high and not worth it in my opinion. I ended up doing better in math, physics, comp sci because it was interesting subject matter.",1197306119

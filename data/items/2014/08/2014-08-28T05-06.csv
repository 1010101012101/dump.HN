8236060,comment,8235880,8235880,8,0,balloot,,,"I&#x27;ve been saying this for years, as I took Thrun&#x27;s class when he was at Stanford.  Google&#x27;s dirty little secret is that self driving cars are still mostly smoke and mirrors.  Given relatively controlled conditions and a trained driver who can play backup when needed, they work.  But if you put them in complicated situations - snow, a busy city environment, abnormal signage - watch out.<p>The problem is that the driving model is probabilistic.  When you solve a problem probabilistically, getting from 90% covered to 99% to 99.9% covered to 99.99% covered involves exponential leaps in difficulty.  So even if the car covers 99.9% of driving conditions (and it currently doesn&#x27;t), there&#x27;s still a tremendous amount of work to be done to get it to 99.9999% correct, or whatever the threshold is for it to be deemed &quot;safe&quot; for fully autonomous use.<p>I personally am bearish on the technology, as getting the inconvenient final situational cases correct will be extremely challenging.  I would love to be proven wrong, but at Stanford I came to the opinion that the probabilistic approach would get us to really cool demos, but never a fully autonomous vehicle.  That being said, the people working on this are a whole lot smarter than I, and I would love to be proven wrong.",1409205541

8236044,comment,8233429,8234799,4,0,fsloth,,,"I get the feeling the anguish arises from working with a large codebase with varying quality of developers. For me the main problem of C++ as a language is that it is marketed as a general purpose programming language while in reality only particular types of developers are capable of using it properly in an industrial context. You have to be an a) expert with b) a good taste or the whole codebase will in time become unmaintainable and/or unstable, or both. And even in the best case scenario there will be horrible bugs arising from some minutiae you forgot to take into account.<p>The expert part is required just to cope. The good taste part comes from the requirement that other people must comprehend your code. i.e. it needs to be simple, pithy and correct. Some languages make it more obvious how to reach this goal than others, while in C++ I see this being mostly the result of trial and error. You require taste, restraint and experience not to implement your production solution in some unmaintaineable template-class-Gang-of-four mishmash &quot;just because you can&quot; and because &quot;it&#x27;s the C++ way&quot;.<p>The main problem with all this, IMHO, is C++&#x27;s continuing popularity. There are some problem contraints where it still is the best tool for the job but those contraints should be well understood and realized when selecting it as the implementation language.<p>> C++ works great for millions of programmers who get it<p>I feel this is a huge productivity loss for the industry as a whole. C++ creates a huge bureaucratic burden on the developers where they must spend their efforts to trivial minutiae and not in value adding work. C++11 improves on this considerably, though. I do not presume to impose some other language on those developers - rather my point is that the issues the FAQ author raises are real and that since lots of people are using the language the severity of these issues is multiplied by the number of people using it.<p>Note: I&#x27;m a developer who mostly writes C++ in an industrial context :).",1409205184

The lower the sensor is mounted on the vehicle, the longer (in direction of travel) the hole has to be before you get a sufficiently large difference to notice between returns from the same beam in subsequent time-steps. This is of course worsened further by increasing vehicle speed. It is somewhat mitigated by having multiple beams, i.e. the Velodyne laser scanner has 64, but even still only a few are hitting the obstacle and surrounds at any one time.<p>Some of the more interesting research in this area uses infrared to detect the change in heat of a shadowed hole versus flat ground.

8235986,comment,8233484,8235397,5,0,comex,,,"The suggestions that performance improvements brought by compiler optimizations are meaningless bother me, though.<p>First, because hardware isn&#x27;t getting faster that quickly anymore: Moore&#x27;s Law hasn&#x27;t meant for a long time that CPUs actually double their per-thread performance every 18 months, so that &quot;1/10th as effective&quot; from your first link, which refers to compilers hypothetically doubling performance every 18 years, starts to get more and more attractive.<p>Second, because while in C/C++ code the programmer can often avoid useless machine code, newer languages such as Rust and Swift tend to do more stuff implicitly (safety checks, reference counting) which could often be eliminated by a Sufficiently Smart Compiler - increasing the need for good optimizations.  (I think that this somewhat mirrors C++&#x27;s early history compared to C, but I was too young then to have any personal experience.)  Of course those languages also tend to have no undefined behavior, so it&#x27;s a bit different...<p>Third, because I don&#x27;t think undefined behavior is as evil and hard to avoid as people think it is.  I think there are a few weird points (you can cast pointers into malloced buffers to any type as long as you&#x27;re consistent, but there&#x27;s no way to do that for a static buffer without fully static layout), and it would be nice to have more control over things like aliasing - both to loosen rules and to tighten them (i.e. more flexible restrict-like functionality).  But despite being a fun topic, it doesn&#x27;t seem to come up that often in practice from what I&#x27;ve seen, so the performance gain is close to free.  And when you&#x27;re, say, fighting for 60fps in a CPU limited scenario, it&#x27;s hard to turn down even a small free performance gain.<p>Fourth, because as someone who reads assembly frequently, idiotic looking assembly bothers me aesthetically even if it often doesn&#x27;t have much performance impact.  I speak in particular of reloading struct fields over and over when the data is already in a register and any person looking at the code would know it would be illogical for it to change in memory since it was loaded - but the compiler isn&#x27;t smart enough to prove it can&#x27;t alias... Sure, in individual cases it&#x27;s easy to cache it in a local variable to stop this from happening, but in the large it&#x27;s hard to avoid.  Strict aliasing improves the situation somewhat, which is one reason I like it.",1409203542

First you need there to be a population of people who can get by without owning cars and have them rely exclusively on driving service. Then you slowly augment the driving service with autonomous vehicles when these folks are going to be traveling along routes that are supported by the cars. These routes will likely be an order of magnitude cheaper to travel, since there is no human driver. The market dynamics combined with the steady march forward of the capabilities of the autonomous cars will do the rest.<p>In other words, I think it&#x27;s pretty unlikely you will just wake up one day and swap out your car for a self driving one to drive you around. Eventually, maybe, but fundamentally it will be less about which car you own and more about if you own a car at all.

The landlord will still have to pay taxes, etc., and pass them along to his renters.

Is there a good way to identify these people, and get a cut of the increase in rent that they could be getting?  Maybe they don&#x27;t know how to advertise or evaluate market comparables?

I&#x27;m not sure how this works in practice (or in theory for that matter).  I&#x27;d think that this would  reduce the availability of rental units, driving up the cost eventually.  If you were renting at the onset of rent control, you got lucky, but for someone newly looking for a place, you maybe don&#x27;t get the benefit?<p>- Property tax ploys.  In some jurisdictions, I&#x27;m under the impression that property taxes aren&#x27;t adjusted to the current market prices (or there is a large time lag).  Therefore those property owners have a tax advantage not available to new entrants to the market, so they can afford to compete on rents.  The business opportunity here would seem to be identifying people in this situation, and convincing them to move to lower cost location and renting out their current homes.<p>What other market inefficiencies are there which would tip the scales toward renting?  Is there a business opportunity in allowing people to rent houses that private parties want to sell?  What I mean is a service, where a renter goes out and finds any house for sale on the market they&#x27;d like to rent, then I&#x27;d step in and arrange the financing, the property management, etc..  They&#x27;d pay monthly rent and wouldn&#x27;t have the burden of home ownership, but they would have housing options that wouldn&#x27;t normally be available.  Are there already companies that do this?",1409202309

It&#x27;s been awhile, but I seem to remember the snow discussion in particular.

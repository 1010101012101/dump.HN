8328099,comment,8322535,8322535,4,0,throwaway9654,,,"As it happens, I&#x27;ve had direct personal experience with the shelter organization named in this article.<p>Several years ago I met a woman, through a friend.  We ended up married not too long after.<p>Just over a month into that, she was acting increasingly erratically, creating fights, attacking me, and disappeared one day with no information as to where she&#x27;d gone or why.  Turns out she&#x27;d gone to a shelter, Next Door.  She contacted me (via phone and email from there.<p>It turns out there&#x27;s a provision of immigration law, called an I-360 petition, that&#x27;s part of the Violence Against Women Act (though both the act and petition apply to all genders) in which an abused spouse of a permanent resident can claim citizenship status.  The claims of the alleged victim are taken prima facie (on their face) to be true.  It&#x27;s quite the law.<p>I visited Next Door, by appointment, having been the victim of abuse myself in this case, both for information on where I could turn, and on what they knew about the I-360 process and how I might protect my own interests (another long story).  I met with the director, Kathleen Krenek, and one of the senior support staff, I&#x27;d have to check my notes, but she doesn&#x27;t appear to be on the organization&#x27;s web page presently.  They were markedly less than supportive.  I made absolutely clear that I wasn&#x27;t seeking information on my ex.<p>AT&T employees weren&#x27;t required to spill this information to my ex.  Next Door informed her themselves, as noted in court testimony.<p>The outcome of the family law case was annulment of marriage on the basis of fraud.<p>My ex remains in the US, presumably by way of her fraudulent VAWA petition.  Apparently the ICE haven&#x27;t bothered requesting or reading the annulment decision, or the Court&#x27;s finding of my ex as &quot;less than credible&quot;.<p>It&#x27;s been five years since the last court date and decision, but this still burns pretty deep.  I absolutely didn&#x27;t consider myself MRA before this (anything but), and find a hell of a lot in the movement that&#x27;s pretty objectionable, but there&#x27;s an absolute truth that the system frequently presumes a role and guilt on men, termed &quot;the abuser&quot; in the relevant VAWA statute, despite the fact that there&#x27;s no actual proof involved.<p>One thing I did learn is that the process is ugly, extremely expensive, soul-sucking, and needlessly confrontational in far too many ways.  Human relationship are like that, and it&#x27;s not until you&#x27;ve seen them go south, and encountered the reasons and deceptions revealed, that you really get a full understanding of this.",1410918996

I&#x27;m pretty sure that most people don&#x27;t really understand what rules even are.  Effectively they want two rules 1) things I like are good and 2) things I don&#x27;t like are bad.  However, you cant just come out and say that because of other social reasons.<p>Back on topic.  I work in a &#x27;nice&#x27; place in Indiana and recently there have been 35-45ish year olds wearing business casual showcasing their drone like remote control flying machines to their 35-45ish year old, business casual wearing friends.  Additionally, growing up I went to church with a guy who ended up recently graduating college with some sort of piloting degree (sorry I dont know any of the details besides &quot;he went to college to be a pilot&quot;).  He&#x27;s now going to be a police man of some sort reportedly because recent piloting regulatory changes have made it even harder to make a living as a pilot.<p>With these two anecdotes in mind, my guess is that the chaotic social fabric that rules our lives will decide in favor of the UAVs and against manned aerial vehicles.",1410918704

8328065,comment,8326658,8327909,3,0,lambdaphage,,,"Yes, maxing out one dimension of performance may degrade it in another.  This is just Berkson, again.  My point is that along the entire range of variation, all reasonable measures of athletic performance are likely to be positively correlated.  If you doubt this, consider the following thought experiment:<p>1.  Pick an arbitrary athletic contest: 100m dash, bench press, obstacle course, marathon, whatever.<p>2.  You pick a member of the population at random.<p>3.  I pick a member of the German national football team at random.<p>4.  If Joe Schmoe wins, I pay you a dollar.  If Dieter Schmieter wins, you pay me a dollar.<p>5.  Repeat until convinced.<p>Who do you think will win more money in the long run?  Will the Germans tend to win because of their high general fitness, or will it be a toss-up because the Germans merely have &quot;high soccer fitness&quot; which does not help (or perhaps even disadvantages) them at non-soccer tasks?<p>That is what I mean when I speak of a &quot;general factor of fitness&quot;.  Over the whole range of population, people who do better at one athletic task will tend to do better at any other.  If you take a sample from the population, measure their performances on whatever athletic tasks you choose, and drop the results into PCA, you will find one factor which is positively correlated with every test and explains, I&#x27;m guessing, at least 3/4 of the variance.  What happens at the extreme tails is already acknowledged, and does not bear on this general point.<p>I tried to find data for non-elite-athletes taking something like the NFL combine and couldn&#x27;t find anything, but there, at least, is a testable prediction for you.<p>My only point about a &quot;general factor of fitness&quot; was that I am unfazed by the comparison to IQ, because physical fitness is a perfectly reasonable concept that captures something real in the world.  So too IQ.  If you think the analogy is inapt, remember who brought it up :)",1410918354

Apple clearly demonstrated the fundamental functionality of their Watch and the hardware does determine the software — they have a hardware button dedicated to one particular feature ffs. Any additional functionality via WatchKit will at best be supplemental. It&#x27;d take a while for iOS developers to get to grips with the new paradigm.<p>Furthermore, in his haste to differentiate Apple from the competition<p>> My impression of Android Wear is that it’s best thought of as a wrist-worn terminal for your Android phone and for Google’s cloud-based services. An extension for your phone, not a sibling device. Android Wear devices are almost useless other than for telling time when out of Bluetooth range from your phone. I don’t think that’s a device that many people want; it’s a solution in search of a problem. Call me biased if you want, but I think Android Wear is simply the result of the rest of the industry trying to get out in front of Apple, out of fear of how far behind they were when the iPhone dropped in 2007. On the surface, they do look like the same basic thing: small color LCD touchscreens on your wrist. But all Android Wear devices are larger and clunkier than the larger 42mm Apple Watch, and none of them are even close to the smaller 38mm one. Is there anyone who would dispute that Apple Watch is far more appealing to women than any other smartwatch on the market?<p>The new Sony Smart watch(1) already has more functionality (gps, waterproof, longer estimated battery, transreflective screen visible in sunlight) than the specs of the AppleWatch while the Asus ZenWatch(2) matches it in feminine looks (if not in expensive materials). Both will be out before the AppleWatch and likely for lower prices than the cheap entry-level AppleWatch. AndroidWear OEMs are iterating faster with a wider range of options. Gruber is comparing actual shipping products (Moto360) to promised unreleased products from Apple, indeed he&#x27;s hoping Apple exceeds their promises.

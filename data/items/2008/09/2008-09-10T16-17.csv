300527,comment,299862,300512,0,0,gaius,,,"There are other reasons. For instance, it lacks granularity; if the only statuses are ""partner"" and ""employee"", there's not the flexibility of options grants. People are willing to suffer as the low status and long hours as employees in law firms and accountancies because of the guaranteed payoff when making partner, tech is a lot riskier. At partnerships the partners typically bring in the bulk of the business, a tech company would have a very hard time hiring talent if it were run along those lines. Not to mention that the partners have an unlimited personal liability. A law firm doesn't require much capital and doesn't risk much either. A high-tech company often needs to (do) both.<p>A high-tech <i>services</i> company could be run as a partnership, as Accenture was for many years, but they turned themselves into a public company so they could use their stock as acquisition currency.",1221065378

That makes me think of machine language: absolutely no abstraction.

Anyway, from the article we can't say if that's what Reges meant.<p>The idea of a generative model reminds of the Architect, one of the INTP types, blokes the seek to model everything and understand every little detail of how stuff works.

It's a function of who lives in those cities, what the support network looks like, and how good the competition is. While living in Chicago I worked in futures while trying to get a band off the ground. Compared to other bands and futures workers I/we were average. The problem was that the competition for bands was so weak and the competition for futures traders was so high that when I finally got spit out of both of these I found I was above average as a a futures trader but below average as a musician. Relatively speaking you are only as good or slightly better then the competition. You have to pick the best competition to compare yourself to or you will never grow.",1221063773

But, that is so self-evident as to be a non-statement. Certainly no need to write an article about that.<p>It&#x27;s the advocated approach/conclusion that is nonsense. Failure to ask people what they need or want as this article and many before it advocate, is not <i>the problem</i>. In fact, such an approach can be counterproductive.<p>What has gotten old (and was never true) is people advocating this as <i>the</i> way to build a product/company.<p>The reason this matters is because it obscures the real point: Marketing is hard and is its own animal. There are many other moving parts involved in getting a product to market in a manner that reaches and compels the intended audience. To say that people aren&#x27;t selling because they didn&#x27;t build the right product is so simplistic and misleading that it does earnest entrepreneurs a disservice.",1379854234

Wanna try?<p>I can make up reasons why, maybe because I moved to another country to take a job, or after all they don&#x27;t like me or whatever.

Software engineering mostly isn&#x27;t a practical application of computer science.<p>To use the example posed above: you cannot be designing chemical processes without a solid grasp of the theory. You cannot do your day to day job without applying the theoretical concepts of the field to daily problems. That&#x27;s what makes a PhD valuable in that field.<p>In contrast, many software engineers have no idea about lambda calculus, set theory, type theory, etc. You can build a lot of software with just the crudest theoretical understanding that you can pick up from hacking on software. That&#x27;s why I likened it to carpentry. A carpenter will have a crude theoretical understanding about wood, it&#x27;s grain patterns and how it absorbs stains, etc, but he doesn&#x27;t need a solid foundation in the science to effectively do his job.",1379852577

Is theses Microduino fake?<p>Keeping the above in mind, arduino was designed with open hardware in mind.

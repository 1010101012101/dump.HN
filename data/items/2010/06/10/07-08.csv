1419427,comment,1418755,1419266,0,0,philwelch,,,"I was a fanatical Ayn Rand devotee at the age of 17. I highly recommend Ayn Rand to intellectually inclined, socially outcast 17 year old boys who enjoy reading about rough sex, if only because she is less obscure than Nietzsche. (""Less obscure"" being a relative term--Rand took great liberties in redefining everyday words like ""selfishness"", ""altruism"", ""mysticism"", ""sacrifice"", and so forth, quite possibly without realizing it. As confusing as that may be, it's possible to learn and apply Rand's definitions of these words to make sense of her. Interpreting Nietzsche is a much higher order of difficulty, and is recommended to either historians of philosophy or angsty, socially outcast college undergraduates for whom Ayn Rand was not nearly dark enough.)<p>Philosophically, there are a number of technical points that Rand was wrong about. It's hard to blame her for them, but one is almost forced to because she took herself seriously as a philosopher. (On the other hand, most of the points are of little practical interest.) Chief among this are her failed attempts to rationally justify both knowledge and morality, neither of which are satisfactory in the end. Her grasp of the history of philosophy is poor--she claims Kant as her nemesis while appropriating large parts of Kant's ethics, for instance. These are not entirely unrelated faults--on the points of epistemology where she is able to correctly identify her disagreements with Kant, she fails to grasp the reasons Kant is right and she is wrong.<p>Her epistemological system (as expressed in <i>Introduction to Objectivist Epistemology</i>) is not clearly either descriptive or prescriptive in its outlook--it seems to attempt both, risking incoherence in the process. As a descriptive work, it comes across as an amateur's guess at cognitive psychology, written without a hint of empirical data. As a prescriptive work, it falls short (Rand talks a lot about concepts but doesn't make one hint towards the subject of propositions) and is hampered by the same free-floating departure from empirical reality that hold it back on descriptive terms.<p>For Rand as a novelist, I have to question anyone whose idea of a dramatic climax is a 30 page speech about philosophy. I'm not even going to make a joke about the rough sex, because all things considered the rough sex kind of fits into the general atmosphere of her books. She's actually a fairly clear writer if you're predisposed to read logically and literally.<p>There's a lot good to be said about Ayn Rand, and she's not an entirely bad stop on the path of someone's intellectual development. But as a final destination one can do much better.",1276156498

Depending on what you want to do after, it may or may not be a wise decision.<p>From your post, it sounds like intelligence isn't the problem, but rather one of motivation.  While doing well academically does require a baseline intelligence, the more important thing (like most things in life) is a matter of effort.  Perhaps this comes from your lack of any concrete goals.<p>I found myself similarly lost when I first started my university education.  Actually, I started off by going to a community college, and while at first that was disappointing, it also gave me the chance to sample a wide variety of subjects, and eventually finding out CS was what I was passionate about.  By finding my passion, I was able to overcome my previous motivation problems.  Perhaps if you try new things as well, you might find something that sparks your drive.",1276156097
1419412,comment,1418743,1418752,0,0,patio11,,,"I am potentially very troubled by it, because I think the capability of a team of capable engineers/marketers to A/B test and measure their way to addictiveness increases much faster than the ability of people to adapt to the stimulus.  In particular, I think that there probably exists one or more vulnerable segments of the population who get ROFLstomped by this.<p>I chuckled with most folks about being ""addicted"" to WoW, but I play some of the social games on Facebook.  One of them has a particular mechanic where you buy a treasure chest.  The price is immaterial, and it is obfuscated -- we've learned that people suck at fractions so if you price points at 80 to the dollar sales increase versus pricing them at 100 to the dollar.  Anyhow, buying a treasure chest gives you a 5% chance at one of four particular desirable items.  It also gives you chances at less desirable items, which are designed to make you feel (like a slot machine) that you <i>just missed</i> getting the good one.<p>(I'll note that despite being fairly decent with numbers, my ballpark guess for how much you'd probably spend in USD to get one of those items was off by a factor of four.)<p>There was a long thread on the forum about folks spending hundreds of dollars rolling for that treasure chest.<p>I have no particular problem with a well-off individual spending hundreds on virtual goods.  However, I don't think that 90% of e.g. Zynga's bottom line is coming from folks like me.  I think huge portions almost certainly come from people who are relatively poor, less educated, have poor impulse control, and who cannot afford what they're buying.  If you look at the AOL ad click data, they found that this is the type of person who clicks -- almost obsessively -- on advertisements.  They <i>don't understand</i> that they will not win a million dollars if they punch the monkey.<p>I'd prefer to see the industry self-regulate to avoid exploiting vulnerable people.<p>Considerations like this are why I decided against doing a Facebook game -- I was genuinely worried about what my stats would show me.",1276156060

1419409,comment,1418308,1418873,0,0,gojomo,,,"Because you asked: I did not initially downvote your comment. However, as the asker of the question, I understood the phrase ""Apple's term for RTM"" was just a compact way of saying, ""the term used by Apple for the concept some others call RTM"".  I did not detect any implication in that wording that ""Golden Master"" was <i>uniquely</i> or <i>primarily</i> or even <i>originally</i> Apple's term.<p>But you read those more specific implications into the statement. Out of two ways to read the answer, you chose the less-charitable interpretation: that the writer was making a stronger claim, and misleading people. In that sense, I can understand downvotes as trying to send the message: read charitably, assume the best-possible-interpretation of comments, and save your corrections/clarifications for things that are wrong under all interpretations, not just one strict interpretation. Otherwise we get crazy meta-tangents like this.<p>Finally, though, the 'dispute' (such as there is one) motivated me to actually read the Wikipedia article and Google [""golden master""] on both the web and old Usenet postings. It turns out the phrase is overwhelmingly associated with Apple, and perhaps Apple was the first to use exactly that term for a software release, in the late 80s. So the implication that it is an Apple-originated term may be appropriate, despite you having heard the term in other software contexts.",1276155972

Here's some examples (<a href=""http://www.turnpoint.net/wireless/has.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.turnpoint.net/wireless/has.html</a>) and here's one you can do in maybe 30 minutes (<a href=""http://www.turnpoint.net/wireless/cantennahowto.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.turnpoint.net/wireless/cantennahowto.html</a>)<p>Those antennas are good for long-haul point-to-point links, but can also do a pretty good job in point-to-multi, if it's close by.  I gave a neighbor internet access for a few months with one of these pointed at his house, without any special gear on his end.<p>Omni-directionals are a bit more advanced, but there are some good designs out there.  I built one similar to this once (<a href=""http://wireless.gumph.org/articles/homemadeomni.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://wireless.gumph.org/articles/homemadeomni.html</a>).  Because these are a lot more sensitive to flaws than directionals, it's important to test.<p>Sector antennas are a good compromise between omni and directional, as it gives you a nice wide area of coverage (<a href=""http://www.grynx.com/projects/wide-angle-sector-antenna-14-dbi/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.grynx.com/projects/wide-angle-sector-antenna-14-d...</a>)<p>Keep in mind that just installing DDWRT and cranking up the juice doesn't always result in a better wifi experience (though sometimes it can give access to that one dark spot), and is probably screwing up everyone else's experience.  Hooking an ipod up to a bullhorn gives you nice range, but there's a lot less fidelity.",1276153756

",,"I want to place email, name and address fields in a parked home page on a Web site that has not launched. I need to collect emails and build a database so that I can announce progress and eventual launch. Ideally, I want to respond to anyone who completes form with an automated email.\nI'm looking for a selfhosted solution, ideally php but since other users may have this problem, you can submit any one you know, no matter wich language, any Wordpress plugin/template suggestion will also be really good.

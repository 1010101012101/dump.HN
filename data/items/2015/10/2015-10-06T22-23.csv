  Weight (regular vs ultra light)
  Ports, keyboard, touchpad should be standard I think. Maybe premium ones might have the latest techs but nothing should be atrocious.
  The next bit should be priced based off whats chosen but really most cpu, ram, storage, display should be available on all model. You might restrict the premium to some high end configuration but even on a non-premium build you should be able to get high end display for most part.

I think simplifying its UI would be like forcing an experience programmer to use something like SourceTree rather than command-line git: it just wouldn&#x27;t work for them, they would lose the &quot;muscle memory&quot; acquired over years of typing away commands on a keyboard.
On a different note, I am quite wary of some people within the open source community who seem to love their esoteric and unnecessarily complicated UIs.",1444171634

10342943,comment,10339852,10341466,0,0,kasey_junk,,,"Let me start by saying, arguing about martial arts on the internet is beyond cliche, so I&#x27;m a touch embarrassed to write this.  But I&#x27;m a dan ranked aikidoka who has also spent a fair bit of time on jujitsu mats and in boxing rings (though I&#x27;ve never fought competitively) so maybe I can add some context.<p>You are absolutely right to question the practicality of Aikido, especially as judged by &quot;effectiveness by any of the standard mma rulesets that have evolved in the last 20 years&quot;.  Quite simply for an aikidoka to be competitive in that sort of violent conflict they must learn the standard techniques of what has evolved into a new martial art.  Things like sprawling (and other take down defense), guard/ground work, thai kicks, etc are the most effective form of fighting for non-weapon, similarly sized, time limited 2 person combat sporting events.<p>Aikido will add nothing to your chance of winning that event, and could potentially increase your chances of losing.  This is unsurprising as all of the martial arts have had to adapt in the face of this modern art (including things like thai boxing and bjj).  The Aikido community has been particularly bad at taking these lessons to heart and in conjunction with an already high level of ambient mysticism you get a combination that makes a style of practice that is closer to dancing meditation than to a martial practice.<p>So why do I continue to train in Aikido (in conjunction with other martial arts)?  Because violence is a wide subject.  To be quit honest, when it comes to violent encounters between 2 largely similarly skilled opponents, the one that is stronger and faster and more willing to commit violence will &quot;win&quot; the encounter more often than not.  No amount of nerd wishing that technique can make up for physique will change that and I&#x27;m unlikely to actually need to engage in that sort of violence.  But multiple attacker scenarios or scenarios where it would be bad for me to inflict physical injury on an attacker are much more likely for my own risk assessment.  Good aikido dojo have practice that allows for this sort of training (but many do not).<p>Finally, I&#x27;ll say that you can learn most of what you need to know about self defense (assuming its not a part of your profession) in a weekend seminar (IMPACT! for women I highly recommend).  But I train in boxing and aikido both regularly because of the physical benefits.  I <i>like</i> the dance meditation, just like I <i>like</i> taking a well placed punch.  But I&#x27;ll be training in aikido long after I&#x27;ve had to give up the boxing.",1444171443

A small number of banks could not attract buyers, so the FDIC fowarded your deposit to an account you specified. I recalled that may have taken a few weeks. Very few over $250K accounts were dinged. One of the TV new magazines followed the FDIC on one of these Friday missions. That was good publicity to calm the public. I recall at the height there could have been a FDIC personal crunch.

My 1997 code runs in current Tcl/Tk, although I had at some point broken it by adding a #comment without a semicolon before it, but that was never valid.  I think Tcl introduced some incompatibilities around 1992 or 1993, since the old icb client I used, which embedded an early version of Tcl from around that time, had some incompatibilities with scripts written in Tcl 4.<p>1997 is probably pretty close to the last time I worked with Tcl.<p>Tcl lists and arrays (dictionaries) are great, but arrays aren&#x27;t first-class; you can&#x27;t pass them as arguments or return them from expressions, only store them in variables.  I&#x27;d argue that TclOO objects aren&#x27;t first-class either: you don&#x27;t have to explicitly destroy strings or lists (which are strings!) or even arrays when you&#x27;re done with them, but you do have to explicitly destroy TclOO objects, just like Tk widgets.<p>I don&#x27;t mean to imply that the object-graph memory model used by Lisp, Python, Perl 5, Java, ML, and Ruby has no disadvantages compared to the flatter memory model used by Tcl, Perl 4, and awk.  But usually, for the things I do in low-performance interpreters, the disadvantages of the object-graph memory model are less compelling than the advantages.

Exemptions are case by case. They give these FAQs[1] on their site breaking down what that permit is.<p>Here are some excerpts from the SKYPAN exemption. These are issued as letters if you see the link[2] below and are evaluated on the case by case basis, following are relevant intersting excerpts specific to skypan[3]:<p>ESTABLISHED PRECEDENCE<p>====================================<p>> FAA found that the enhanced 
safety achieved using an unmanned 
aircraft (UA) with the specifica
tions described by the petition
er and carrying no passengers or 
crew, rather than a manned aircraft of signi
ficantly greater proporti
ons, carrying crew in 
addition to flammable fuel, gi
ves the FAA good cause to find th
at the UAS operation enabled 
by this exemption is in the public interest.<p>TYPE OF VEHICLE<p>====================================<p>This is the operating drone Specs:<p>> Operations authorized by this grant of ex
emption are limited to the Align T Rex 700E 
F3C when weighing less than 55 pounds in
cluding payload.<p>GENERAL RULES (speed, altitude, oversite)<p>====================================<p>> may not be operated at a speed exceeding 87 knots (100 miles per hour).<p>> The UA must be operated at an altitude 
of no more than 400 feet above ground level<p>> All operations must utilize a visual observer (VO).  The UA must be operated within 
the visual line of sight (VLOS) of the PI
C and VO at all times. [I think PIC is person in control]<p>OPERATING AROUND AIRPORTS (SkyPan)<p>====================================<p>The UA may not operate within 5 nautical mile
s of an airport reference point (ARP) as 
denoted in the current FAA Airport/Facil
ity Directory (AFD) or for airports not 
denoted with an ARP, the center of the ai
rport symbol as denoted on the current FAA-
published aeronautical chart, unless a lett
er of agreement with that airport’s 
management is obtained or 
otherwise permitted by a COA issued to the exemption 
holder.<p>OPERATIONS AROUND CITIES (SkyPan)<p>====================================<p>All Flight operations must be conducted 
at least 500 feet from
 all nonparticipating 
persons, vessels, vehicles, and structures unless: 
a.
Barriers or structures are 
present that sufficiently pr
otect nonparticipating persons 
from the UA and/or debris in the event of an accident. The operator must ensure 
that nonparticipating persons remain under 
such protection. If a situation arises 
where nonparticipating persons 
leave such protection and 
are within 500 feet of 
the UA, flight operations must cease immediately in a manner ensuring the safety 
of nonparticipating persons; and 
b.
The owner/controller of any 
vessels, vehicles or struct
ures has granted permission 
for operating closer to those objects and 
the PIC has made a safety assessment of 
the risk of operating closer to those 
objects and determined that it does not 
present an undue hazard.<p>SOURCES<p>======================================<p>[0]<a href=""https://www.faa.gov/uas/legislative_programs/section_333/333_authorizations/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.faa.gov/uas/legislative_programs/section_333/333...</a><p>[1]<a href=""https://www.faa.gov/uas/legislative_programs/section_333/333_faqs/#q1"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.faa.gov/uas/legislative_programs/section_333/333...</a><p>[2]<a href=""https://www.faa.gov/uas/legislative_programs/section_333/333_authorizations/media/skypan_international_11352.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.faa.gov/uas/legislative_programs/section_333/333...</a><p>[3]In the letter the decision is based on other proposals, so some of these rules are possibly boilerplate.

Operators usually know what needs to be done for their specific environment, even if the software they&#x27;re running doesn&#x27;t.<p>If we could eliminate the bullet wounds we wouldn&#x27;t EVER need logs. As long as we have logs, we need some way to process them and react to their events. For many organizations, for decades, this has been to have an alerts system and an active operations team fighting fires. Those teams maintain knowledge-bases to track institutional knowledge of how to manually react to these events.<p>Solutions such as Stackstorm and IBM ZAware seem to be created to allow that institutional knowledge to be automated. I&#x27;ve also seen (and built) proof-of-concepts using Bayesian filters as part of such systems.

Many businesses, particularly very small ones, depend on external services to be viable in the first place. It&#x27;s right that those businesses should pay attention to data protection and privacy issues -- I&#x27;m a strong believer in such things personally -- but there also has to be some reasonable framework for what can and can&#x27;t be done by default, without requiring explicit consent for every last detail.<p>The trouble with opt-ins for everything is that it instantly scales beyond the point of being practical. Just as hardly anyone actually reads the 9,753 page terms and conditions document before checking the box or pays any attention to the &quot;we use cookies&quot; notices, so hardly anyone will pay attention to formulaic &quot;we might export your data outside the EU and foreign governments might spy on you&quot; warnings. Creating a system that no basically reasonable and ethical business can actually comply with in practice will just result in no-one taking the rules seriously and consequently no-one actually enforcing them, again much like the cookie notices and so on.<p>Ironically, a good solution in this case is easy to see: the US government could make it absolutely clear that interception of or interference with personal data held by US companies can only be done following proper, legal processes, and then the EU governments would need to update the rules about Safe Harbor provisions to allow a reasonable exception for government access to personal data following due process. Throw in mandatory encryption at a level where the shortest path to getting data needed for legitimate government purposes is to just get the appropriate warrant or equivalent and formally request that the business in question hand over the relevant data, and probably most people are happy.<p>No-one serious about the privacy debate seems to be suggesting that businesses should never have to turn over personal data they have access to in order to comply with something like a proper court order to provide evidence for a case being heard by that court. It&#x27;s the dubious access to the data <i>outside</i> of proper legal processes and oversight that causes the conflict here, and at least parts of the EU government system take that sort of thing a lot more seriously than most of the US government right now.",1444170355

10342788,comment,10342000,10342628,0,0,jamesfryman,,,"Disclaimer: I am an employee at StackStorm<p>Tools like Puppet and Chef are great at managing the state of a single node. However, with any piece of infrastructure that expands beyond a single node, things can get complex pretty quickly. In times where the state of the systems change, there often are a multitude of steps that need to occur to ensure that the intended state is met. However, because tools like Puppet and Chef are node-centric, you often find yourself waiting a long time for eventual convergence as a code is executed for a node, updated state data transferred to some upstream data server (Chef server, PuppetDB), and then other nodes converge with updated data. Depending on the task, this convergence time can be killer.<p>In contrast, StackStorm is an event-driven automation framework that will help perform the incremental tasks across many systems necessary to properly move from one state to another. Common examples include ensuring that Load Balancers are up before advertising network services, ensuring SQL standby servers are alive before enabling replication, and so forth. Each of these steps is going to require an imperative set of steps to transition between states. With StackStorm, we plug into a multitude of tools (including Puppet and Chef!) that provide event updates as actions take place, intercept these triggers, and execute workflows. In many cases, we have clients that heavily use a configuration management tool like Puppet or Chef, but rely on StackStorm to orchestrate the various runs of these tools on different nodes as checkpoints are reached. In this way, decrease the feedback loop as you have StackStorm listening for &quot;run finished&quot; notifications from these CM tools, and then we can go and figure out what is next by kicking off actions or workflows as necessary.<p>There is absolutely a ton more about StackStorm beyond this immediate answer. In addition, we include things like Role Based Access Control, ChatOps support, full audit trails, and more. I encourage you to check it out and provide feedback.

For a lot of objectives you might have, you have to learn to do the hard parts of both of them.  The hard parts of programming include design, analysis, testing, debugging, and verification.  You aren&#x27;t going to learn how to write a compiler in 21 days.  (Most programmers don&#x27;t learn how to write a compiler in 2100 days, although that&#x27;s probably more because they aren&#x27;t trying because they&#x27;re intimidated.)<p>2. &quot;Software is in a crisis because we don&#x27;t know how to program, and the solution is to manage software projects as if they were construction sites, using misguided metaphors about bridges invented by people who have no idea what happens when you actually try to build a bridge.&quot;  No, in fact you have to understand both management <i>and</i> programming (motherfucker!) to manage a programming project effectively.  When programming is being done effectively, you automate all the repetitive parts, which dramatically reduces costs and timeframe, but dramatically inflates the unpredictability.<p>Instead of managing software projects like construction sites, we&#x27;re going to be managing construction sites like software projects, using proven libraries, mathematical models, repeated simulations, iterative exploration of unknowns to reduce risks, and pervasive automation.  This is all in Engelbart&#x27;s papers from the 1960s.  Doing things that way (applying software techniques to hardware) is how we became able to build hardware with billions of transistors in the first place.  It might be 2020 or 2035 when most of the effort in building a house is done by people using computers to manipulate models of the house, and only the last step involves (fully automated) machines rolling onto the construction site to materialize your carefully debugged plans, but it&#x27;s going to happen.  (I don&#x27;t know if being able to deploy a new iteration of your house every week in order to fix bugs and roll out new features is going to happen before or after that.)<p>Now, it&#x27;s <i>true</i> that we don&#x27;t know how to program (although developments like seL4, coqasm, Excel, NaCl, and PHP seem to be making some progress on that front).  But the &quot;software crisis&quot; isn&#x27;t about that.  Rather, it&#x27;s about how Moore&#x27;s Law has reduced the cost of computers so much that programming is suddenly the limiting reagent in nearly <i>everything</i> in the economy.  You can get a 48MHz ARM processor with 64kB of program Flash for US$1.76 and burn ten thousand lines of C into it, then use it to run a string of Christmas lights.  For US$6.46 you can get a 48MHz ARM processor with 1MB of program Flash and burn a hundred thousand lines of C into it.  Or you can put a Lua interpreter into 20% of that memory and fill the other 80% with eighty thousand lines of Lua.  The &quot;crisis&quot; is that it costs literally <i>a million times more to write the code</i> than it does to make the processor.  (Prices from Digi-Key, unit price for quantity 1000.)  The &quot;crisis&quot; started in 1968 when the price of hardware at last fell below the cost of writing the software to take advantage of it, and it&#x27;s been &quot;worsening&quot; ever since.  And that&#x27;s the origin of &quot;software engineering&quot;.<p>3. &quot;Programming is super hard and you have to be a wizard to do it at all.&quot;  No, anybody can learn how to program.  We have Excel, JS, and PHP.  If you have a computer and already know how to read, you can learn how to program a little bit in a few days, and usefully in a month.  There are still going to be a lot of things that are beyond your capacity, but you&#x27;ll be able to do some things.  It might take you years of work to learn how to write like Dean R. Koontz, but you don&#x27;t have to be a Dean R. Koontz to write a shopping list, a YouTube comment, or a love letter.  Programming&#x27;s the same way.",1444169417

So is rudely telling someone that they &quot;went off on some pointless irrelevant rant&quot; and introducing pointless flamewar material in the response before that.<p>Instead of playing back at them, I guess I&#x27;ll just post the rules next time.<p>- &quot;Be civil. Don&#x27;t say things you wouldn&#x27;t say in a face-to-face conversation.

It&#x27;s a stellar monitor, but at full 2x pixel doubling, it doesn&#x27;t offer as much space as my 30&quot; Apple Cinema Display years ago. When you disable pixel doubling and opt for a scaled resolution, it&#x27;s a little blurry but still good. (Tip for people running a scaled resolution with a Mac on a 4K display: disabling pixel smoothing makes text a little less blurry.)<p>There&#x27;s been a bit of a gap between <Period of time where we had affordable 27-30&quot; displays> and <Period of time where we had affordable 27-30&quot; Retina-quality displays>. Between those two points in time, tastes among Retina desktop users changed, but 5K display prices still are very high (the pictured UP2715K will set you back $1700).<p>I think it&#x27;ll only be a matter of time, I&#x27;d say 2 years, before we see affordable 5K displays, though. 4K panels dramatically came down in price in the past few years, and I&#x27;m thinking we&#x27;ll see the same with 5K.<p>Great setup by the way!",1444169065

Sure, the MacBook Air came out and it was amazingly thin. Now there&#x27;s Force Touch, and that&#x27;s quite nice as well.

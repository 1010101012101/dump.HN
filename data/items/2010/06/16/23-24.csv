I met people every week who assume I have no commercial skills because I'm a ""coach"" - not true!<p>So the OP isn't looking for a ""life coach"" any more than a golfer wants a ""life coach"".

I do give a bulk discount that can seem pretty dramatic, in part because I assume the same amount of support on a $8 VPS as on a $68 VPS.  -<p>What I've found is that this is not what many customers assume.  Many customers assume that if they buy a larger, more expensive VPS from you, that they will get a higher level of support, even if ram/cpu/disk is deeply discounted on that large VPS vs a small VPS.  So from that point of view, adding in a 'bulk discount' doesn't make any sense, because you end up spending just as much money supporting one large (and very demanding) customer as many tiny, undemanding customers, so from that point of view, Linode is doing the exact right thing.<p>Now, I've tried to tackle this by being more explicit about the ""you are paying $4/month for support."" bit.  I'll be opening orders for large customers again later this month, I hope, and we'll see how well that works.<p>Another possibility is that Linode sees support costs as fixed... in many ways, they are.   You need to acquire a good team, train them in customer service, and then have enough of them that at least one is on line at any time (I'm not quite to that last part yet, which is part of why I need to insure that my prices fly beneath Linode's.)<p>You need to have enough people to handle peaks, and support is very peaky, so unless you queue it up (causing latency and customer dissatisfaction)  much of the time, many of your support people are going to be idle (or working on non-support stuff)<p>even so, the greater your customer's support demands are, the higher your peaks will be and the more support people you need, so I think the former is far more likely than the latter.",1276730822

(If he cared about whatever task you're thinking of, he'd have mentioned it.)<p>I think the problem is that he is simply ignorant of what people actually have to do when creating complex technical things. I think he honestly thinks that he can go do a couple of client meetings, get some paperwork signed for some custom work and there's vending machine in the back that spits out custom software. The thousands of hours of mind numbing things like, looking at trace logs, or defining a controlled vocabulary so that your team and the customer's team can even communicate on the same level, are absolutely not within his sphere of understanding. In those matters he's as incompetent as I am in his arena. The difference is that I know that and don't disparage him when he says things like ""executing this NDA really took a huge amount of effort."" I have no idea if executing an NDA involves anymore than 5 minutes of actual work and lots of thumb twiddling or if it's an active, engaged process one can spend hundreds of hours on. I know that he thinks that when he does a 30 minute deal closing meeting, that he did all the work to make it happen and should get all the credit. Never mind the last 6 months by our engineering team working nights and weekends to fulfill a custom customer requirement.<p>> He's given you a specific case that he thinks is a big deal. Why won't you address it?<p>I'm not quite sure I follow. The way I see it, I have relatively few ways to address it:<p>1) Tell him to go F off, which I'm not sure does anybody any good.<p>2) Do the ""let's trade jobs for a day"" thing. But the only things that he would be able to do, because mine <i>is</i> a job that requires lots of domain knowledge in nearly every task, are the most meanial and time consuming ones. I'm not sure it'll provide the right kind of impression if I give him a task like ""here's a list of 20,000 numbers, find all the ones with a non-numeric character in it"".<p>3) Reorg this part of the company so interactions are limited. This might be the only direction that prevents undue internal conflict and keeps us in our respective lanes.<p>4) Ignore him and hope he learns to respect other people's work. In my experience this doesn't happen since this kind of behavior is largely ego driven.<p>5) Openly confront him (different from #1). This is the direction I'm presently going, but it's annoying and time consuming. I don't particularly feel the need to justify or explain the details of my job to him (especially when he won't understand the details anyway), senior mgmt already holds my work in high regard and that's who I have to answer to ultimately. The other departments in the company also work well with me and respect me. However, I'm rapidly moving towards #1 or #6.<p>6) Quit. But as a senior manager in my company, and the only person with domain experience with our customer base plus the technical training to be able to handle several different roles at once, I know that it would sink the company (which as a shareholder does me no personal good, and would put a number of people out of work who I'm responsible for). I think that would be irresponsible unless I knew there was a reasonable replacement to fill in for me.<p>> This isn't about you. It's about him.<p>It sure is, a small company like ours doesn't have the time or resources to ego stroke an employee.<p>> BTW - If he thinks that something can be done better, it doesn't matter if said thing is technical and he's not. Again, stop questioning his competence.<p>I'm not sure I follow. People are competent in their own areas and incompetent outside of that. I think he's quite competent in his as far as I can tell. He's not competent in mine. He's not offering suggestions for improvement -- which I'm always open to, from anybody regardless of field. He's openly questioning why a complex 6 week project he handled the contracting for takes 6 weeks of active, hands-on work, and not 45 minutes, a hand shake and a signature so I can then move on to help him with another sales pitch. It's stupid and unreasonable. For goodness sakes, he's been with the company for a few years now and to my knowledge has never even installed the software!",1276730625

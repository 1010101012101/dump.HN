But he&#x27;s not wrong if he means a small publication (or more likely, an individual journalist) can make a successful go of it. Consider the &quot;1000 true fans&quot; business model. It is entirely possible to earn a respectable, six-figure income doing independent journalism for a small, but loyal base of subscribers.<p>It&#x27;s extremely hard work. The payoff/effort ratio is probably lower than the ratio on the kind of corporate job that someone smart and hard-working enough to pull it off can take instead. (And this is probably why you don&#x27;t see legions of smart, hard-working people trying to do it.) But it&#x27;s doable, and some people are doing it. They&#x27;re doing it on a small scale, to a loyal niche.<p>I have my doubts as to the scalability of the model, i.e., building it out to support a multi-million-dollar business. Plenty of well-connected and well-funded people have tried. Some of the best journalists in the business have tried. A few of these people have very publicly failed. But I am inclined to think that there&#x27;s a decent sweet spot out there. It&#x27;s not big, but it exists.<p>Stranger things have happened, though. This is a crude analogy, but consider the success of a show like <i>The Walking Dead.</i> Ten years ago, if I&#x27;d have told you that a show about zombies on basic cable was going to be one of the most watched shows on all of television, you&#x27;d have told me I was insane. And all available data at the time would have supported your position. The truth is, <i>TWD</i> could not have been a hit 10 years ago, much less on AMC. Various supporting technologies make its success possible: Netflix, iTunes, Amazon, Facebook, Twitter, VOD, and so forth. (Even DVR was in its early-adopter phase a decade ago.) Game-changers happen when the supporting infrastructure is in place to enable bright, risk-taking people to put the pieces together. For all I know, the conditions are in place to let someone find, address, and serve millions of people who are ready for &quot;slow&quot; journalism. It&#x27;s an uphill battle, but I sincerely hope more people will strap on their climbing gear.",1418752667

I take back the implied characterisation of you but I&#x27;ve seen it many times that when Aotearoa is discussed among foreigners online, Pakeha apologists come forward and start pushing their agenda in a way that sounds very reasonable and benign to those not in the know.

Rowe Price. “You’d compare it to a brand or tech company—maybe Chipotle or Uber.”<p>> WeWork said its December revenue puts it on an about $150 million annual revenue run rate. It also said the month’s annualized operating income puts its valuation at roughly 100 times income. It expects to grow significantly in years ahead, which would lower that ratio. Landlords typically trade between 18 times and 20 times earnings, according to Jed Reagan, an analyst at real estate consultants Green Street Advisors.<p>> Price depends on location. In the company’s Financial District headquarters, it charges $400 a month for a desk and $1,400 a month for a small two-person office, well above the area’s rate for such space.<p>> The business is a risky one in which its costs, fees paid to landlords, are fixed, but its revenues from startups and established businesses can fall quickly when the economy slows.<p>> “The small-to-medium-size businesses, they get particularly impacted in a recession,” said Jon Halpern, who ran shared office space firm HQ Global Workplaces in the early 2000s.<p>> HQ grew rapidly in the run-up to the dot-com bust.

We&#x27;re a small, nimble team of three engineers and a designer, looking for another engineer to join us.<p>We are trying to solve one of the biggest problems in hiring: how to effectively measure a person&#x27;s fit for a job. We want to do it in a way that is intuitive and transparent for both employers and job-seekers, and which scales to support organizations of any size. We believe that the right solution requires both algorithms and human judgement, and we are developing technologies which incorporate both. We believe that by building a product around new standards for assessment in recruiting, we can dramatically improve the accuracy of hiring decisions, as well as the job-seeking process.<p>We&#x27;ve already helped build teams at hundreds of companies, including, Facebook, Google, and airbnb, and helped hundreds of thousands of applicants in their job searches.  You would help build pieces of the employer- and job seeker-facing apps, as well as internal tools we use in our back-end operation.  You would also contribute to our R&D effort, working with domain experts to incorporate their knowledge and experience into our web application.<p>Some of our current projects include:<p><pre><code>  - a data model for assessment that includes human- and computer-generated 
    input to render decisions about job applicants
  - testing our assessment model using data about hiring and retention
  - optimizing and automating applicant sourcing to yield high-quality
    candidates
  - creating actionable feedback for job applicants
  - integration with applicant tracking systems
</code></pre>
Ideally you:<p><pre><code>  - are interested in the hiring process and excited about improving it
  - can communicate clearly and precisely about technology and product
  - are comfortable in the full stack, and very strong in a few areas
  - have at least one year of Rails experience
  - are located in or willing to move to NYC
</code></pre>
Our technology stack includes Rails, Postgres, Git, and Heroku.  We each own specific product verticals, and enlist each other’s help to get them shipped.  We like to have thoughtful discussions together on a range of topics, from software architecture to company strategy.  We make sure every voice is heard and every opinion is considered.<p>Please introduce yourself to developers@hireart.com (with a resume or GitHub url, if you have it) to get started.",1418752092

Here’s where you’re probably expecting the sales pitch about how mind-blowingly awesome the demo was. But it’s a little more interesting than that. Yes, I saw something on that optical table I had never seen before--something that only Magic Leap, as far as I know, is capable of doing. And it was pretty cool. But what fascinated me wasn’t what Magic Leap had done but rather what it was about to start doing.<p>Magic Leap is mustering an arsenal of techniques--some tried and true, others unbelievably advanced--to produce a synthesized light field that falls upon the retina in the same way as light reflected from real objects in your environment. Depth perception, in this system, isn’t just a trick played on the brain by showing it two slightly different images.<p>Most of the work to be done is in applied physics, with a sizable dollop of biology--for there’s no way to make this happen without an intimate understanding of how the eye sees, and the brain assembles a three-dimensional model of reality. I’m fascinated by the science, but not qualified to work on it. Where I hope I can be of use is in thinking about what to do with this tech once it is available to the general public. &quot;Chief Futurist&quot; runs the risk of being a disembodied brain on a stick.

Here are some real world recent errors I&#x27;ve had to deal with, where testing wouldn&#x27;t have saved me:<p>- Poorly documented external API returns a redirect instead of a 404 in some cases.<p>- Missing <title> tag in a random HTML template.<p>- Poorly assembled SSL certificate chain for an HTTPS service fails for some browsers, but not all.<p>- Celery tasks taking longer to process because there are now more things to do as more users sign up.<p>- Starting a DB transaction in the wrong place causes more failures than necessary when only some of the modified rows cause constraint violations.<p>- External API returns 0 sized file with no errors instead of the correct response, depending on time of day and phase of the moon.<p>- CSS issue rooted in poorly set up position and z-index properties causes elements to be mis-aligned.<p>- Missing clear: both;<p>- Database server&#x27;s disk filled up with log files from a rogue service.<p>- Hosting provider gets DDoS&#x27;ed and their mitigation software starts returning random site redirects.<p>- Namecheap&#x27;s DNS gets DDoS&#x27;ed and the site is inaccessible.<p>These are not the types of things that are easy to test, but very easy to verify by hand or catch at runtime. Personally, I am much more in favor of design-by-contract and logging and alerting of bad conditions at runtime.

One of my projects (LogHog, a much easier to use syslog-type-thing for Python), has lots of tests because it&#x27;s got a very simple and well-defined interface. It&#x27;s almost library code and verifying its correctness is both easy and useful at the same time. But not all projects are like that, and sometimes easy testing is not actually useful and useful testing is cost-prohibitive.<p>tl;dr: I can test the obvious stuff, but I can also just spend more time writing it more carefully.

8758130,comment,8756193,8757752,0,0,sebular,,,"In 2014, China produced nearly 1/4 of the world&#x27;s CO2 emissions, with the US coming in second at 15% (however, I believe we&#x27;re the worst emitters per capita).  Within the US, 32% of our emissions come from powering the electrical grid.  So globally, that&#x27;s 32% of 15%, or a little less than 5% of the world&#x27;s total emissions.  If we were to start building nuclear plants and replacing coal plants, the most we could really hope for is a fraction of that 5%, maybe 2 or 3%.<p>In my mind, the negatives of nuclear outweigh the positives of potentially reducing global emissions by a percentage point or two.  Since you agree that nuclear is only a stopgap measure, doesn&#x27;t it seem like a drastic move?<p>We&#x27;re talking about demolishing coal plants to build nuclear reactors within our borders that will produce long-lasting radioactive waste material and pose Chernobyl/Fukushima/Three Mile Island-style threats to public safety, simply so that we can demolish those in a few years when solar/wind/fusion &quot;gets there.&quot;<p>On the other hand, if we used a combination of wind power and home-installed solar panels to simply reduce the energy draw on our coal plants, that would also reduce our home electricity draw.  And imagine the economic boost we could see if the government was suddenly offering vouchers for home solar.  Not only would that provide a lot of jobs for people to do the installations, but it would boost public interest and investment in solar, strengthening the technology as we spread its adoption.<p>This isn&#x27;t to say that I don&#x27;t think nuclear has its place.  I think it belongs on the enormous ships that produce the world&#x27;s worst pollution.  You may have recently heard a report that 16 supertankers produce more (sulphur) emissions than all of the world&#x27;s automobiles combined.  These massive ships aren&#x27;t held to environmental standards, and they burn some of the filthiest fuels.  Yet we&#x27;ve been running nuclear subs without major incident, far away from the general population, for decades.<p>Why not use nuclear reactors in the worst-polluting vehicles, and encourage the proliferation of safer technologies domestically?<p>sources:

The only places where citizenship is explicitly mentioned in the US Constitution is in regard to eligibility for federal offices and jurisdiction of the federal courts. To a non-lawyer, it looks like a slam dunk.<p>It&#x27;s not a slam dunk. The second amendment reads:<p>> A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of <i>the people</i> to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed.&quot;<p>Who are &quot;<i>the</i> people?&quot; In the Preamble to the Constitution, the phrase &quot;the people&quot; clearly refers to the political community creating the new government, which arguably excludes illegal aliens. The Supreme Court in Heller v. District of Columbia construed &quot;the people&quot; in a way that is consistent with that use, and which lower courts have taken to mean that illegal aliens don&#x27;t have second amendment rights.<p>However, the bill of rights uses &quot;the people&quot; to refer to the first amendment right to peaceably assemble, and the fourth amendment right to be protected against unlawful search and seizure. If &quot;the people&quot; is interpreted consistently for all the amendments, that implies that illegal aliens don&#x27;t have several rights under the bill of rights, which is problematic.<p>See: <a href=""http://scholarlycommons.law.northwestern.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=7452&context=jclc"" rel=""nofollow"">http://scholarlycommons.law.northwestern.edu/cgi/viewcontent...</a>.",1418751303

The motor could also apply a slight braking force, to pitch the blades in the opposite direction.<p>The flight computer determines the correct timing at which to apply more <i>oomph</i> to the drive motor, which translates to the same effect as a mechanical swashplate due to the angled pins.

It&#x27;s probably not a brush motor, but a 3-phase synchronous motor. That means instead of having a commutator to apply the voltage to the coils, a computer switches some FETs to apply the voltage. In the simplest case, the rotor is assumed to follow the applied voltage waveforms. In a more typical system, the rotor position is estimated from the applied phase voltages and measured currents (usually via PLL or a sliding mode observer).<p>If you mean &quot;how do they determine the blade pitch?&quot; then the answer is that they don&#x27;t need to. The controller - weather that&#x27;s a computer with inertial sensors, or a person watching it - will just manipulate the amount of torque variation until it gets the response that it wants from the copter.

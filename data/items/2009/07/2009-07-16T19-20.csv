Keep on truckin':<p>* You should add a title, logo, and a tag line that summarizes what the site is for, because people who aren't coming from HN won't know. I like your link that says what you index, but how about summarizing that with one word, one image, and five more words for a tagline.<p>* Of all the titles for your search results sections, I only know what Sphinx is. I've never heard of Ferret, SOLR, or Xapian, and so these words just confuse me. I mean, I can make an educated guess, but why should I? These words don't convey information and should be removed. How about interpolating your search results?<p>* I feel like your search results are intended for consumption by a machine. Can't you pull snippets that humans can understand from the stuff you index? Numbers and slashes make me dizzy.<p>* How about a nice autocomplete? That's sort of standard for search engines these days, and would be particularly appropriate in this domain. YUI provides an easy to use package for this.<p>* There's no reason to use red for your links. Use blue, and underline them, because otherwise some people won't figure it out.<p>* Finally, I think you know that your colors and UI need work. Maybe you have  designer friend who can give you some pointers. I could also recommend a great one that works for fairly cheap and does my projects.",1247773139

The car analogy is really apt here.<p>I can buy a Toyota for $20K that will get me to work at the same time as I could if driving a BMW. It costs a hell of a lot less for the same functionality, and if we believe the reliability numbers, will last me just as long (if not longer) than the BMW - certainly longer than I plan to own the car anyways.<p>So why would anyone in their right mind buy a BMW? Or really anything more expensive than a Toyota? User experience. Maybe I like the extra frilly features like dual-zone climate control, power seats, in-dash GPS, projected HUD, or whatever. Or maybe I like the fact that the interior has a lot better fit and finish than the Toyota, and is made from far better materials. Maybe I like the fact that it sits low on the ground and doesn't feel like it's going to float off the ground at anything above 70mph.<p>These are the factors and the features that people easily discount, but add untold amounts of satisfaction to the user experience.

Why don't you tell me why paying more for the same hardware specs for the Mac should be justified? Because it 'looks' better? Are you all that superficial?

Don't give me the crap about Windows is so popular because it comes pre-installed, OS X runs on Apple computers, if these people wanted OS X they'd have bought an Apple. Also, with that market share, there is obviously a crapload of repeat customers.  If PCs were so bad, why do people continue to buy them?

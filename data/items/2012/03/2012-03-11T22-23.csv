Since the scanners have a 54% false positive rate, approximately half of those using the scanners receive some form of pat-down, further slowing the process.

There are some, but not many. What are the chances that you worked with a lot RDBMS, yet never encountered SQL even at the basic level, and it is not immediately evident from your resume, which still says ""SQL""? But OK, if that's the situation, you can say ""you know, I worked with non-SQL relational databases, and let me tell you about this cool thing I've done that is way better than SQL JOIN can do"" - and that might be fine too.

This issue arose when people started making unauthorized third party games for video game consoles that made use of code in the ROMs of those consoles.<p>The SFLC says that calling a function <i>does</i> make your code a derivative work of that function's code. I've never seen any analysis from them that explains why they think the video game cases don't apply. They are a free software advocacy organization--they naturally tend to take the most free software friendly interpretation possible of law, and I think that often takes them a little past what the law actually is into what they wish it was.<p>It would be interesting for someone to write a simple blogging system with a plugin interface that is compatible with Wordpress' plugin interface, and put it in the public domain.<p>Then anyone making a plugin could claim that they actually wrote it for the public domain system, and that is what they are a derivative work of rather than Wordpress. It would be amusing to see what the SFLC would make of that.<p>Something like this actually happened once, in the early '90s. Someone was distributing a secure email system that used RSA. It used RSA via the RSAREF library, which was freely distributable but not free software. The email system was distributed in source form. When you compiled it, you could compile it to use either the BSD arbitrary precision math library or GMP. Basically, the source had #if statements that selected whether it should assume the BSD library or GMP. (I believe GMP was under GPL, not LGPL, at the time).<p>Stallman didn't like this.

It's become a point of ritual that our department saunters down to the canteen, orders a dreary meal, and then complains about it. This is the sort of problem which libertarians want to solve with more competition. That's a noble idea, but what competition, exactly? I don't have the freedom to start up a restaurant of my own nearby -- I would need the university's permission. The university is thus in some sense government-like: it owns territory, demands some sort of 'tax' in the form of tuition from the denizens of that territory, probably charges Sodexo certain 'property tax' analogues for operating there, and businesses cannot operate on their territory without their explicit consent. The Men With Guns that I've heard libertarians talk about are sort of there, but a step removed -- that is, if you <i>did</i> try to open up this restaurant you would probably receive a threat and ultimately the police could escort you away; just as might happen if you sit-in on courses without paying tuition and they catch you. The most major difference is that universities can expel you; usually criminals in a nation get imprisoned, not deported.<p>I guess what I'm saying is, It's not just ""economic ways you can control an honest man"", but there are potentially many ways to implement an authoritarian state inside a libertarian utopia -- and to me that just sounds like ""there's something wrong here."" It's like a security vulnerability in a political stance, or so.<p>I don't know; I don't have the answers.

3691468,comment,3690734,3691230,7,0,angrycoder,,,"> It can't be that much more work to do the whole interface with UIKit.<p>It really does take that much more time.<p>Just to use a simple example of displaying a list of data. An experienced web developer can take a list of data from a database or web service, loop through it, and spit out a decent looking page in 10-15 minutes. Maybe take an 15-30 minutes of tweaking and styling to make it really look professional.<p>Now, doing the same thing on iOS, you use what is called a UITableView. There is no type of magic data binding included, so you have to wire the whole thing up by hand. A bit more extra work but nothing too terrible so far. Now, tableviews are great if you only need to display text in one of 4 predefined ways, but that usually ends up not being the case. You end up having to make your own UITableCells to get things laid out just the way you want. So you make a cell and start loading it up with different label fields, one for each differently styled piece of text you want, image controls, etc etc. Now, if you are doing this the 'right' way, each of these cells should have their own controller because by now the method that is providing the cells to the UITableView has a ton of logic in it and is acting as the controller for your custom cell. But, you have to maintain this list of controllers seperately inside your UITableViewController, further down the rabbit hole you go.<p>You think you are all done, but depending on how fancy your cells are and how long your list is, you notice the scrolling is jerky, not smooth, not very 'iPhoneish'. So you read some more and figure out the only way to get really smooth scrolling when dealing with complex cells is to manually draw them yourself and not rely on a collection of controls contained inside the cell. So there you sit, drawing out your individual cells with pen-style graphics methods and blitting text and images like you are a video game developer.<p>Most of the nice interactions you think of as being native, aren't. They are something that a developer had to do by hand. Even something like not having the keyboard cover up a text field has to be done manually.<p>I'm not saying it isn't worth the time to do a full native app, but it does require a lot of time, UIKit gives you very little for free.",1331505153

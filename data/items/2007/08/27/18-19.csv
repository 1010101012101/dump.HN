I do not mind if you change the URL as well. I think the suggestion to use ""YCombinator Applicant"" would solve it in the future for anyone else. Cool? <p>",1188240711

47092,comment,47078,47078,0,0,pg,,,"There was a rash of startups doing this to get attention a few months ago.  After the first couple we started deleting such descriptions.  It's an edge case, but probably abuse, especially considering the motive.  <p>Which incidentally is probably also a large part of the motive for this post.  If you were really just interested in the abstract question, you could have avoided the appearance of an ulterior motive by making this a straight question instead of linking to your original post.

47086,comment,47079,47079,0,0,pg,,,"We're not going to quote the number any more.  The reason is that we now have competitors, and we don't want to get in an application number war.  It's easy to get massive numbers of applications by encouraging applications from people you know you won't accept: for example, undergrads who don't really want to drop out of school.  We don't want to tempt anyone to do that.",1188239874

47083,comment,47067,47082,0,0,knewjax,,,"I am one of the founders. I do not consider it dwelling on the fact that we were rejected. It doesnt actually bother me at all as you can see from most of my previous posts I have been labeling ourselves that way to help motivate others to keep pushing forward. The second reason i label it this way is because i think on HackerNews people are naturally curious about all the Ycombinator applicants a little bit more than just any startup. I may be wrong though but this is my reasoning for highlighting the fact that we were indeed rejected but continue to move forward. ",1188239551
47082,comment,47067,47075,0,0,jsjenkins168,,,"That is a very lame way to label yourself though. Rejected by YC, rejected by VCs, rejected by your peers, whatever. ALL startups experience some sort of failure one time or another. Its getting back up when you get knocked down (EVERY time) that leads to success.<p>Bandsintown is an excellent web application and in my opinion the founders should be looking forward rather than dwelling on a past YC rejection.\n",1188239336

Actually I think there are people who can hack and people who can do business, and there is substantial overlap, as in the classic Venn diagram.  The best founders are in the lenticular region in the middle.  The people who can only hack can migrate to it more easily than the people who can only do business.<p>IBM's rule that each group has to have both hackers and business people reflects their belief that the world is partitioned between them. It only makes sense if you believe there is zero overlap in the Venn diagram. That's where we really disagree.",1188238958

And i know i have read posts from others curious about rejected YC companies and how they were doing now. I think I saw one as early as last week. ",1188238409

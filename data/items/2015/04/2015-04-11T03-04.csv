However I am surprised they didn&#x27;t even invite you to the interview. Are you currently in US? Could be a reason.<p>Anyway looks like you are doing great, if you ever want to do something together - let me know, I&#x27;d love to know more about how many people you guys have and for how long have you been operating etc.<p>I am getting a sense that you either should have a strong founders team or a lot of traction\revenue with an opportunity to become very big. In your case maybe having a team of people also &quot;too late for YC&quot;, and you can become successful on your own.<p>I also heard that they don&#x27;t like video made of pieces, who knows what some alumni might not like when he sees your application.<p>Regards,Alexandr

White, black, cyan and magenta all have significant contrast between them, and many machines with CGA were still hooked up to B&W and greenscreen monitors. If you&#x27;d designed your graphics around Mode 0 (the yellow, green, red, black one), it would look really terrible on a greenscreen. Even full colour displays (often TVs) would look miserable in the other colour modes, as they&#x27;d bleed much more than displays do now. The white/cyan/magenta/black was also really easy to build as a secondary palette for 16-colour EGA games. I remember a lot of the Sierra adventure games at the time offered a CGA mode, and while it never looked nearly as good as the EGA mode, it was at least playable.",1428724712

9358404,comment,9358166,9358257,0,0,dmritard96,,,"Thank you.  Its not a matter of do we spend 4 Billion gallons of water to save 6 fish.  The point is a deeper question about the human race&#x27;s resource consumption in the larger picture of things.  Another facet of this is &#x27;flushing&#x27; as if flushing in it of itself is some natural phenomena.  In reality, its also a compromise between our need for reliable water and a natural watershed.  Given how much water is going into animal based agriculture in California (not Almonds like so many people like to scape goat), it will be interesting to see if there is any real change in behavior from humans.  For instance, there is this big push to reduce lawn watering and car washing, both things that are wasteful in a desert - but if we eat beef at every sitting, it might be just as much water consumption.  There needs to be a comprehensive breakdown of individual/household water consumption where you can put in what you do/eat/where you live etc.  This should be compared to top down approaches that are more common and then there should be a campaign/effort to dessiminate statistically based information that suggests where and why you should cut down on your resource consumption.  It needs to be data driven.",1428724118

It makes the target country more bitter and paranoid, cements the feeling that they have to stick together against the external enemy, encourages their government to escalate in response.

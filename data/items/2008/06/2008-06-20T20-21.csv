Although it's process model is novel, the implementation might not be perfect for everything right now. Correct me if I'm wrong on this (which I might well be, since I have not spent too much time writing Erlang code.)<p>I think what the parent meant is that writing multithreaded programs easily and quickly (not to mention bug-free) is hard, hard enough to be called a problem.",1213995147

Yes, I'm serious.<p>A lack of coding style doesn't just make it hard to read code; it is indicative of the mindset of the author.  It speaks of being sloppy; of not caring; and of not expecting people to read the code.  (It also tends to be an indication that the code was revised many times without any clear vision; but that's a secondary point.)<p>The author of this article writes "" <i>If I ask a real estate broker about a house, his first reaction should not be his opinion on the quality of the paint, because that is not going to help me as a prospective buyer. I can easily have someone else repaint my house, but I cannot easily change its foundation.</i> ""  Maybe he takes a different view, but if I turned up to look at a house and saw paint peeling off the sides, I'd probably drive away without even looking inside -- not because I care about the paint, but because I care about the general neglect which the paint indicates.<p>I don't care what style you use; but if you don't care enough to have any style at all, odds are that the foundation isn't very solid either.",1213994814

223199,comment,222607,223176,0,0,timr,,,"<i>""I'm not a biochemist, but I understood that protein folding actually has immediate application in understanding disease and drug design....what problems in compiler optimization make it a thousand times more useful than protein folding and associated medical problems?""</i><p>Short answer:<p>Compilers are used for real work, every day.  Nobody is using protein structure prediction for anything practical, and they likely won't be for decades more.  At this point, it's blue-sky research.<p>Long answer:<p>""Immediate application"" is one of those bits of academic-speak that really means ""is related to"", but sounds better to grant review boards.  While it's true that <i>protein folding</i> is important (after all, most biological processes are mediated by folded proteins), it's <i>not</i> true that <i>protein structure prediction</i> is important.  It would be great if we <i>could</i> predict protein structures accurately, but we <i>can't</i>, and until we can, it's not a practically useful discipline.<p>Even the very best, crystallographically determined protein structures are barely sufficient to do rational drug design, and predicted structures don't come close to that level of quality.  For example:  we can sometimes (very rarely) predict very small (<150 residue) protein structures to within 1 angstrom RMSD of their experimentally determined shapes (i.e. >2 angstrom resolution, in the best case).  However, the interactions important to drug binding, protein design, etc., don't start until a tenth of that (scales of ~0.1 angstrom).<p>Throw in the fact that the vast majority of proteins are much larger than 150 angstroms, and that we keep creating cheaper, faster, more automated ways of getting actual <i>experimental</i> information on structure, and the role of protein structure prediction looks increasingly marginalized.  It's definitely a cool, fun problem -- just not a very practical one.<p>For whatever it's worth, my first papers were on applying the state-of-the-art method (you've heard of it...I think you're paraphrasing the lab's PR) for protein structure prediction to genome annotation.  To call the approach useful was/is a stretch, and that's for a much easier application than drug design (in fact, we were trying to find a practical application for protein structure prediction, and it was the most likely thing we could think of!)",1213994713

It may not be as feature rich as IPhone SDK or Google Android but it is probably the most ubiquitous platform for cell phones today. You can download a free WTK (Wireless Tool Kit) from java.sun.com and there are good tutorials on the same site for J2ME beginers.<p>One thing to remember is if you make use of any of the even a little bit fancy functionality of the cell phone through J2ME (SMS send/receive, Phone book integration or location based services) your app probably won't work on real handset outside the emulator - at least in US. All cell phone carriers here are control freaks and they have turned off all those permissions for any ""not officially blessed"" third party app. This is the main reason for the lack of any worthwhile mobile applications in the first place!",1213994308

223189,comment,223005,223119,0,0,jcl,,,"As I understand it, the problem is that the web server stores the user session state in continuations, and old continuations need to be discarded regularly to keep the server from filling up.  The error appears when the user tries to do something that requires a continuation that has already been discarded.<p>The easiest solution, then, is to simply increase the length of time that the continuations are held -- hence increasing the number of continuations held at once.  If this were as simple as changing a number somewhere, I assume PG would have already done it.  Hence it is likely that the server is already retaining as many continuations as it can at any one time, expiring them as it goes.<p>So the obvious solutions are: Get a heftier web server; rewrite mzscheme's continuations to take less resources; or rewrite HN to not use continuations.  The first cannot be done with source code alone, the second has yet to be accomplished by Scheme's brightest minds, and the third is unlikely to appeal to PG.<p>(Edit: Not that I want to discourage anyone from improving Scheme, arc, or HN... just pointing out that the solution is harder than a simple bug fix.)",1213993991

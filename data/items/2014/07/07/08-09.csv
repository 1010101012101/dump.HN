One was a car mechanic for 20 years before starting a CS career.  All of them are very good at their CS job.  I think the years of experience in a non-CS branch helps them see different perspectives, things that career programmers tend to miss or consider unimportant.<p>So by all means, go for it.  It might be a little more difficult to find a job than a younger person, but you&#x27;ll manage.  Good techies are always in short supply.",1404723513

7997800,comment,7997418,7997618,1,0,imakesnowflakes,,,">It does look simpler but could it be because there are less functionalities and it is less extensible?<p>Yes, probably. But these are my thoughts<p>1) How Important are the missing parts. For eg, I think you can define custom directives in angular.js. You can&#x27;t do that with Sentinel.js. But can this be still useful without that feature? What I have tried to do is to minimize the number of &#x27;things&#x27; that one needs to learn, by providing more powerful constructs. For eg, angular have ng-even and ng-odd directives to distinguish between even and odd iterations for a repeat loop. But in Sentinel.jS, you can give &quot;sn-computed-&quot; prefix for an attribute, and that attribute value will be evaluated and bound to the given expression. So you can cover a lot of cases with this feature that angular.js cover with a lot of directives.<p>2) Can we add those missing parts without sacrificing its simplicity. For eg, Dependency Injection. May be we can add it without making it a lot more complex.<p>Pardon me calling it as an alternative to angular.js. I just couldn&#x27;t find another way to convey what it does under 80 characters. I know all of these are kind of naive. I know I am a nobody, and there is no way I can be right about these things. But those are my thoughts. Please correct me where I am wrong....",1404723449

7997795,comment,7994673,7995215,4,0,ntaso,,,"From what I heard, most people feel regret at their deathbed for working too much, not the other way around. While you seem to have noble motives, I think many jobs out there don&#x27;t provide much value and don&#x27;t advance society as a whole. Think about large parts of the entire financial industry. Yes, the financial industry is important for a stable economy and a high standard of living, but there&#x27;s a substantial amount of jobs that don&#x27;t do much but redistribute wealth between individuals. It&#x27;s really silly.<p>The biggest question is: What do you want from life? And one way to find out is if you answer the question:&quot;Would you be doing the same if money wasn&#x27;t an issue?&quot;. I think contributing to society through work is hard to define and overrated. Do you think all these silly apps make a difference on the grand scheme of things? Probably not. Does society really need smartphones? It all depends on you and your own values. If you do things that bring you joy, you might be doing more for a healthy society than if you create value through some job that you wouldn&#x27;t do if money wasn&#x27;t an issue.<p>Edit: I started to read this blog recently, which tries to answer what makes a life a <i>good life</i>.

7997777,comment,7996798,7997429,15,0,legutierr,,,"The problem with Bitcoin ATMs is the logistics of cash.<p>A Bitcoin ATM network that operates at a scale large enough to displace or even compete with the remittance networks in Mexico (and other beneficiary countries) would by necessity draw on the banking system to supply it with cash.  This is because all of the cash being withdrawn would have as its ultimate (albeit intermediated) source Bitcoin purchases in the US (or other sending countries).<p>Think of it like this: the Bitcoins being sold in Mexico in exchange for pesos at these ATMs are being purchased by the ATM owner, who will then need to sell them in order to resupply the ATMs with pesos.  Who does she sell them to?  Without a massive (i.e. hundreds of millions of pesos per day) local demand for Bitcoins in Mexico, her buyers are going to have to be foreign--most likely the the immigrants in the US who are sending money home.<p>So, she sells those Bitcoins to Mexican immigrants in the US, for dollars.  And now she needs to buy pesos, in the form of bills/notes, in exchange for dollars--at which point she is in the exact same situation as any standard remittance provider today!<p>Everywhere in the world, one of the primary roles of banks is to manage cash logistics, and to act as the retail face of the central bank, which acts as the ultimate sink for excess cash, and as the ultimate source of cash in the event of a shortage.  As a result, the banks, and then ultimately the central banks, regulators, and governments generally, act as gatekeepers for any large-scale financial enterprise requiring the disposal and generation of physical cash.<p>What&#x27;s more, when you are talking about billions of dollars exiting the US in favor of Mexico, there is only one way that money can move, which is through the central bank, via the banking system.<p>The only way that Bitcoin can displace the current remittance providers is if a large local demand for Bitcoins <i>already</i> exists in beneficiary countries, such that the inflow of Bitcoin could be absorbed locally, or used by recipients without being cashed in.  Either that, or central banks and regulators will have to embrace it--or at minimum tolerate it.<p>That&#x27;s not to say it can&#x27;t happen.  It just can&#x27;t happen without official sanction <i>first</i>, before a local bitcoin market has established itself.",1404722988

HSBC built a computer system to enforce this regulatory requirement. The affiliates omitted information in internal reports to avoid triggering the computer filter for these transactions, and HSBC was like &quot;can you include this information?&quot; and the affiliates were like &quot;no, these transactions are exempt&quot;. This is what the quote refers to.<p>So this quote is blaming HSBC for not demanding other banks file transactions internally in a way they weren&#x27;t required to so as to not automatically trigger a computer system they weren&#x27;t required to automatically trigger.

The more computer science you have, the better. You don&#x27;t have to have a CS degree, but it helps. It doesn&#x27;t have to be an advanced degree, but that helps too.<p>My own take on it is that most programming languages are like cars and the skill of driving computer science: if you can drive one car, you can learn to drive the other and with programming if you can program in one language you can probably program in the other. Knowing the fundamentals about computers, how information is represented as bits, how they store and process information, how they communicate over networks, how you can use them to solve problems like sorting, cache invalidation, etc is really important stuff that is orthogonal to learning a programming language.

In order to profile the Fibonacci heap, you&#x27;d have to implement it first. She mentioned that it took twice as long as the original algorithm, and timing is a simple form of profiling, so she basically did profile (after implementing it).<p>What would have helped is intuition about algorithms and the ability to estimate how fast they&#x27;ll be without having to implement and time them. This was a good exercise for developing that intuition.<p>It&#x27;s useful to keep in mind that O(log n) is effectively O(1) in the real world, because on actual computers, integers are bounded by 2^64, which means that any logarithmic factor will be <= 64 (or some constant). When O(n) and O(n log n) algorithms differ in practical performance, the asymptotic difference is not usually the best explanation, IMO. Linear algorithms tend to be simple and make one pass over the data, which is going to make them fast. O(n log n) algorithms tend to be more complicated, make multiple passes over the data, and/or involve doing things that are slow in hardware, which is going to make them slower.

Since this is going to be electronically processed, perhaps it would be a good idea to include the ticker code for publicly traded companies in one&#x27;s employment history? GOOG is much easier to search for than variations of &quot;Google&quot;, &quot;Google Inc.&quot;, etc.<p>3. The publications schema will need to be significantly expanded if you want scientists and other academics to even consider using this. Take a look at how academic publications are cited. At the very least, there needs to be a field to specify the type of publication, e.g. book, ebook, edited book, journal article, newspaper article, conference presentation, workshop presentation, blog post, website, etc. There should also be a &quot;doi&quot; field for scientific and other academic publications.<p>3-1. The education schema needs a &quot;summary&quot; field, just like the employment schema.<p>4. Some employers prefer to get the content of the reference from the referee him/herself, rather than having the applicant include it in the resume. (Otherwise, the applicant could modify the content.) So you need fields to put the email address (to contact the referee) and a URL (to grab the content of the reference) in the references field. Oh, and don&#x27;t forget the referee&#x27;s employer and title/position. Those things matter.<p>4-1. Bonus points if the content of the reference can be authenticated with the referee&#x27;s PGP key.<p>4-2. Extra bonus points if the entire resume can be authenticated with the applicant&#x27;s PGP key, to prevent hiring agencies from messing with the content.",1404720227

Admittedly, this is in no way representative of anything, but clearly people are still using i386 (note that I summed the 'recent' column!)<p>In short, i386 is not dead. And suggesting that it cannot handle ""gigabytes of data"" is absurd - Postfix/Dovecot, or PostgreSQL, or SAMBA, or pretty much whatever, can handle many, many gigabytes of data without issue on a i386 platform. Yes, you'll need to upgrade to 64-bit for the truly demanding tasks, but a database with a couple of (tens of) GB of data in it can work perfectly well on a scavenged i386, which is one of the good things of a unix-ish system.<p>(That said, you <i>can</i> trade off ease of implementation for being crippled on 32-bit platforms.

Furthermore, (2) the tests are <i>made by teachers</i>.  If they don't like what is being tested, then change it.<p>When news came down the pipe that Virginia was going to have a ""Standards of Learning"" type exam for <i>colleges</i>, the first thing I did was jump on board to help scope (and my plan was to help author) the test (I was physics faculty).  I'm no fool:  if we're going to give the administration a vehicle this powerful, I'm driving.<p>On the other hand, when the Standards of Learning for K-12 schools were first implemented, a remarkable thing occurred in education:  teachers started talking about teaching again.  Until then, every conversation with them was about how bad the administration was, how difficult parents were, how unprepared and unmotivated the kids were, etc.  When those tests went in the conversation turned to:  how in the world am I going to teach all of this?<p>How in the world, indeed.<p>You are also correct that the way peer review is implemented leads either to back scratching or very poor morale.

Sometimes I need to grep etc, but knowing, and having a handle on the entire codebase is pretty useful for when you need to do big sweeping refactoring.</i><p>First off, the main reason people like code completion because it saves keystrokes.  ""syso CTRL+SPACE"" is 6 actions, compared to ""System.out.println()"", which is 20.  Not having to wait to compile to see whether doFoo(a,b) takes (Bar,Baz) as its arguments instead of (Baz,Bar)?  Priceless...<p>Putting that aside for the moment...if it's even <i>possible</i> for you to know the entire codebase, then you're really just not working on a substantial enough codebase to understand why people like IDEs for refactoring; your refactorings are not even close to ""big"" or ""sweeping"".  A heavy duty refactoring might touch a hundred files in a thousand places, and <i>that's</i> where you're going to end up with a lot of pain using grep (esp. since in large enough projects token names tend to get reused, so you <i>really</i> want something that understands the semantics of the language).<p>If a grep is all you need even in order to browse through functions, then you're probably not leaning on .jar libraries; you're <i>definitely</i> not leaning on any bytecode-only ones.<p>If you're happy with the command line for compiling + debugging, you've probably got a fairly simple test + deployment process, maybe just pure .java sourcecode with no testing on other devices or strange launch processes required; chances are, you're debugging with System.out.println instead of a debugger.  That's fine for simple things, but it can be a major waste of time if you run into more sweeping problems that require a bit more exploration to solve.<p>Some more (possibly unjustified, to be fair) assumptions: you likely have not needed to profile your code, manage dependencies between different projects that by necessity can't be merged into one, hot-replace bytecode (a <i>crucial</i> feature for big projects), set up and maintain a Maven repo, work with type hierarchies complex enough that to need to check them to make sure you're not breaking things before you make changes, conform to specific code-formatting guidelines, sign .jars, test on different JVMs, work with code rewrite rules, pre-process annotations, maintain different .jar distributions, analyze logical dependencies, inspect generated bytecode, etc.<p>Yes, each of these individual things is something that you can accomplish with a few shell scripts and some elbow grease, true enough.  But plenty of people have to do all of this stuff all the time, working with projects that are too big for one head to handle, and it really helps if you don't have to dig into twenty shell scripts each time you need to change something about your project.  It sounds an awful lot like you're suggesting that they're in some way inferior for not wanting to manage all this complexity by hand; that would be a big mistake.

He did a whole lot of useful work;  on his resume he brags that he replaced three temps, and he's not exaggerating... he really was more productive than three dudes from a well-known technical body shop.<p>I mean, I think the difference is more in the person than in the job.  At yahoo, if my brother wanted to, he would have been able to skate by doing almost no real work at all... but he didn't.  well, part of that was me pushing him a little... if I get you a job I expect you not to embarrass me.   But I think he would have done useful things anyhow.<p>In my experience, yeah, you aren't always expected to accomplish much... but if you decide to do something useful anyhow, people almost never go out of their way to stop you.  (they might not help you... but they won't stop you if you don't require anything of them.)<p>I remember my first programming job was littered with finished projects that were never put into production because that would have been work.   (I converted our access billing system from a shared-file db that was crashing once a week because 300 people accessed the file over a NT share at the same time to an ODBC connected database... never implemented because the parent company was going to replace it anyhow.   We continued repairing the database for the rest of the year I worked there.)<p>But enough of the shit I wrote had enough of an 'immediate need'  (customer impacting seemed to be the line) to get implemented that I was pretty happy with the job.<p>Actually, that job was /really satisfying/  because so much was so obviously broken that a few small fixes on my end (a three line patch to apache to make dynamically configured mass virtual hosting work with our weird naming scheme/directory layout, and a few lines of c to make our pop3 redirector use a real db rather than a seperate file for each of our three million emails to determine where to redirect the user)  made some really dramatic improvements to the service.  Yeah, that was really, really fun.  Honestly, I'm not sure I've been quite as productive since.<p>Part  of it might have been that nobody knew what to do with.   I was hired up from tech support (god, I sucked at phone tech support)  to the NOC, but the rest of the NOC were network guys and i was hired as a programmer.  (Hah.  that was a laugh.  I had read the white book in high school, and I taught myself perl while I was on phone support at night.)   and the boss was some leathery EE who was great fun at first, then it was switched out to a MBA who wanted to be my friend, but otherwise pretty much let me do what I wanted as long as I didn't piss off the ops guys.<p>Funny story, I found one of the ops guys who worked with me at that job many years later, after the .com crash... working in a deli, and I hired him.",1280341142

A totalitarian system is only totalitarian insofar as it can effect fear on the part of those subjected to it. If the US government (or any other government) were able to suppress the output of media that criticized it by its intelligence services such that ordinary people would not dare reporting what was happening in their communities, this indeed would be totalitarian. The trend, however, is mostly to ignore problematic areas in favor of ones that make one happy.  For instance, focusing on the bright side rather than the dark side of mass immigration with a few selected pieces of anecdotal evidence.  One can almost always spot this selective highlighting at the expense of the larger dataset by the departure from math and ""feel good"" (or, conversely, ""shock"") stories. Since in general people prefer to feel good about themselves, they are either drawn to news which invalidates other parties (other races, members of other political parties) or to fluffy Hollywood productions (there is immense feel good value in watching things blow up on screen, esp. when the other side is ascribed to be ""evil"").<p>That said, I have no doubt that there are many who would wish to see the United States (or other places) become more totalitiarian than in fact they are.

The main focus was on the memory hierarchy of modern computers, which was fine, but there was not much advice about letting virtual memory do its job - the course covered mostly how things work under the hood, but did not give practical programming recommendations.  I can see how budding programmers could get the idea that ""disks are slow, so I should try to manage when data gets copied to and from RAM"" without realizing that the system software is already taking care of it and that attempting to do it manually will generally just make matters worse.<p>As an aside, I found it really hard to read this article because of the grammar errors.  Nearly every paragraph has a run-on sentence, and there's plenty of missing punctuation. The style also seemed more like off-the-cuff rambling (especially the long-winded attempts at humor near the beginning) than carefully-written advice, which almost made me stop reading before getting to the real content.  The message is good, though, even obscured by these problems.",1280340163

I could see doing that in Java where you don't have ability to advise the VM on how you're going to be accessing memory mapped files (no madvise() or fadvise() available despite NIO support for mmap, thanks Sun!), but asides from portability to non-Linux OSes e.g., ZFS ARC Cache on Solaris doesn't honour madvise()/fadvise() the same way Linux page cache does, what would be the reasons against trusting the VM in C/C++ code where you can explicitly ""advise"" (Linux treats madvise() as imperative rather than advisory) the VM on your usage?<p>Redis is a cool product and antirez is a smart guy, so I am sure there must be a reason for this.",1280340160

Seriously, people seemed to compete with each other at how miserable they were. 2-3 years would not have made a difference here.<p>That aside, assuming it would have gotten better in 2-3 years, is it really worth spending 2-3 years of your early-twenties being miserable, convincing yourself that it's necessary and will get better at a later time? Afterall, that's what everyone at this company had done, except replace 2-3 years with 20-30 years; they were in it for retirement.<p>Where do you draw the line? I guess that's a personal decision everyone has to figure out for themselves. My line was 8 months.",1280340155

If you are dealing with a language that makes a strong distinction between the object and the memory layout of that object, you might be better off handling the serialization yourself.  But Varnish is in C, and data on disk is mapped to memory then used directly as a struct.<p>Thus there are no small objects scattered around--- each 'object' is contiguous, and most likely on a single page. Prefetches happen automatically --- in Linux at least, disk caching and the VM are essentially synonymous. The benefit of using the VM directly with mmap() is that you have more control over the details and less overhead.",1280340034

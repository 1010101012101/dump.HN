This function is partially evaluated for a fixed universe of documents and super optimized.<p>Evaluating hundreds of parameters is common sense for machine learning tasks. If you look at the papers explaining how the top Netflix prize competitors achieve their score, this is again what they do: they run literally hundreds of algorithms over the dataset and then blend the results. And this is for a domain where their data is only (user, movie, rating, date) quadriplets.",1233151102

You want to make sure that continues to climb. A high PR helps, but focusing on it won't help. Focus on building links with good anchor text, that match the keywords you are focusing on.<p>And if you do have a an actual PR 7 in Google that is great. It means you have a lot of link authority. Use it by targeting certain key pages on your site for the keywords that will drive traffic.",1233151060

And because your body has an electrical capacitance, it offers the potential for that. I figured that if you put a voltage into the saw blade, your body could absorb some of that signal. Then the voltage in the saw blade would drop.<p>Within a week, Gass formulated most of the idea’s details in his mind. Thirty days later, he completed his first working prototype. Initially, he tested the prototype by touching the side of the saw blade with a finger. And while that proved the saw could stop in a fraction of a second, he still didn’t know if it was quick enough to prevent serious injury. Gass wondered how deep a 4,000-rpm saw blade would cut into human flesh during the microseconds that it took to stop the blade. To answer that, he needed to touch the blade teeth.<p>""I came up with the idea of using hot dogs, and it worked pretty well,"" Gass says. ""It’s cheap, readily available, and you don’t get any protesters coming to your door.""<p>From a Design News article - he was chosen as DN's Engineer of The Year 2007 (aside: DN is one of the <i>best</i> pure applied engineering publications that I actually read - apply for a subscription)<p><a href=""http://www.designnews.com/article/print/5897-Man_on_a_Mission.php"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.designnews.com/article/print/5897-Man_on_a_Missio...</a>",1233150541

I feel ok (or even somewhat glad) regarding what I did in the software world.<p>However, since a kid, I loved science, and recently I realized that it seems you can't do serious science from outside the academia. It's ok to drop out if you want to do great software, but if you want to do great science it's suicidal. So I feel like I did a very serious mistake in the past, and that maybe it's very late to fix it (and yes it makes me very sad).<p>Does anybody else feel like that too? Can you do your share of serious science, even as a hobby, if you don't have a degree and you are outside of academia? Maybe applied science (technology) isn't so restrict regarding titles and academia, so that's probably a solution for this. But in science, I think if you don't have a degree and you try doing something, you are most probably seen as a crank.<p>Sorry but for some personal reasons I need to stay anonymous.",1233149375

When someone is out of work looking for a job, there are usually two responses to a rejection: depression or anger.<p>TechCrunch (and Arrington to a lesser extent these days) get hundreds of tips or requests for coverage from companies and when TC passes them over, these people who are relying on press to get their name out there, can sometimes get angry. And when TC does cover a company in the same market, or sector, but not their company, it can be interpreted as an insult.<p>Arrington is the face of TechCrunch. As much as Erick and the others write for the site, Arrington is still seen as the embodiment of it.<p>I don't care for him, as he does come off as unlikable, and he is also prone to sensationalism for the sake of traffic I feel sometimes, but I hate to read this post.

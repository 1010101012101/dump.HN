I don't think the idea (if this is not a scam/joke) has merit because even if you forget your SSH passphrase, you have access to the server via a root password (stored somewhere safely in a fireproof-safe; and even if not physical access at worst).

Most visual elements are absolutely positioned divs (called ""views"", CPView in Cappuccino, NSView in OpenStep/Cocoa). We catch all events and handle them ourselves (i.e. determining which views get the event, etc). This gives us things like the ""responder chain"" and much better control over events. Normally it's impossible for an element behind another element to receive an event, but not in Cappuccino. A lot of little problems are solved by this approach.<p>There's a lot more to it than that, but it's late and I need sleep...",1215682114

However, it is also dense and math-heavy, so it will take some discipline to work through the book.<p>If you just want to play around with graphics or don't like to program in Java, there are programming environments made especially for programming graphics like Processing [<a href=""http://processing.org"" rel=""nofollow"">http://processing.org</a>] and Nodebox [<a href=""http://nodebox.net/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://nodebox.net/</a>].

Any profession can lobby the state to increase the barriers of entry to that profession.  Buying the service becomes more expensive and  young people must spend far more time in school.  A small gain to the current practitioners of the profession ends up being a huge cost to society as a whole.",1219013950
278674,comment,278501,278572,0,0,KirinDave,,,"Not every site has to be youtube to be successful. Lots of small sites pay for themselves, make their owners money, and handle all their traffic. This isn't bad.<p>As an example, I've heard my former employer mog.com managed to get a pretty darn sweet deal and continued funding out of the Sony-Gracenote-acquisition. We definitely had a slow ramp-up, and several setbacks during development (before I got there) that made the total dev time for the site startlingly long.",1219013933

There's nothing surprising about that.",1219013727
278671,story,,,1,2,ashleyw,"Ask HN: Online routines and distractions?",,"I seem to spend so much of my day by getting distracted with cool articles when I'm working at home, its not like its time going down the sink, IMO reading is a very good way to spend time (and I bet you all agree – being here) – but sometimes its time I don’t have, or at least time I would prefer to spend on things more productive.<p>And its not because what I’m doing is boring (most of the time), but that everything else is equally interesting – just because I’m not working on a project, it doesn’t make it even 1% less interesting to me.<p>My distractions come from several places - HN, Google Reader (75 feeds), Digg a few forums, and most of all - from researching; search A, find A+B, search B, find B+C, ...<p>So my question to you guys, is how do you deal with online distractions, and overall you’re routine to remain productive when working?",1219013529

278666,comment,278322,278631,0,0,paul,,,"The GET side of REST is usually reasonable and non-controversial. It's the other verbs where things get crazy, with people arguing that you should PUT comments to a document instead of doing a POST to /addcomment (because add comment is a verb). I gave some examples on the other thread showing how the supposed caching benefits are largely imaginary (beyond simple GET caching), and simple RPC is easier to deal with (because you aren't limiting yourself to 5 verbs).",1219013008

278661,comment,278453,278606,0,0,rplevy,,,"I think (today's) Lisp could be blub, but only if Lisps were to become the standard category of programming languages. Then some other more advanced meta-lisp that is a few layers of abstraction up, and applying some yet-undiscovered principles of computer science in its high-level semantics would be at the cutting edge, and the vanilla lisps would be mundane and practical-seeming.",1219012627
278660,comment,278342,278647,0,0,mattmaroon,,,"Once again, I take issue with your definition of off-topic, since the guidelines seem to suggest that anything intelligent is on-topic. This a good, interesting, in-depth article about Obama would be on-topic, whereas anything below that in your progression would be off.<p>I don't think PG will allow it to progress to ""McCain is a big old dufus articles"". He has stated that he would not, and that he has constructive solutions to that problem that he will implement if he feels it necessary.",1219012571

There might have been a more insightful paragraph written somewhere else on the Internet today, no doubt buried in the middle of some four page article. But pound for pound it's hard to come away from Seth's blog feeling like you haven't gotten your money's worth.

Next stop: reddit.   First come articles like this, then more, good, interesting in-depth articles about Obama, then just plain old Obama articles, then McCain is a big old dufus articles, and so on down the drain.  See, for instance, maxklein's comment below.  That's exactly what I fear happening when these types of articles turn up.<p>Perhaps we could create a HN-offtopic on some site that implements social news, by invite only, for HN users, and use that for politics/economics/whatever.  Any other ideas for a constructive solution to this problem(+) that don't involve lots of PG's time?<p>(+) With ""the problem"" being defined as: ""we are interested in off topic articles, but are afraid of what they'll do to the site in the long term"".",1219010726

As a person of African descent and a Latin American living in the U.S. I am constantly struck by leaders who do not understand the world economy or simply dont care. A country like Zimbabwe, if they were to invest in their youth in say OLPC for instance or sending x number of students to study Computer Science or Engineering abroad; they would see an untold benefit societally in 15 to 25 years.

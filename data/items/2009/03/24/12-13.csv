530034,comment,529822,529991,0,0,mechanical_fish,,,"<i>It's real easy to see how a negative hit to someone like Bernie Madoff ruins his career...</i><p>Yeah, about $65 billion too late.<p>It's not even a question about reputation <i>scaling</i> -- which (as you say) it does not do, which it hasn't <i>ever</i> done, since even in 10,000 BC you could travel to a place beyond the range of your reputation. (Maybe the Internet will change that. The jury is still out on whether it can, as well as on whether the negative consequences of that are too great and we'll have to take steps to ensure that the Internet <i>can't</i> destroy your reputation worldwide. Reputation isn't all smiles and balloons. You can destroy innocent lives with reputation. Happens all the time.)<p>Reputation just doesn't <i>work</i> in all sorts of situations. Madoff is a prime example, but anyone who uses Twitter, reads <i>The Four Hour Workweek</i> or spends twenty minutes watching TV commercials can find thousands of additional examples. Reputation is easily faked. It is easily bought. It is too readily extrapolated from one narrow field of endeavor to another. It is biased toward members of your family, and toward people who resemble members of your family. It relies on past results to predict future results, and thereby mispredicts events that occur on a longer time scale than the acquisition of a reputation. It works by implicitly assuming its own effectiveness and breaks down in edge cases. (""Why would Mr. Jones feed me Kool-Aid laced with poison? Just think what that would do to his reputation!"")<p>Most importantly, reputation is just a <i>predictive</i> tool. When it fails, it leaves you with no recourse: That is not its job. I can use my accountant's reputation to predict whether he will steal my money. But if he does steal my money, reputation is now useless as a tool for getting my money back. That's what a contract is for. The primary purpose of a contract isn't promoting trust; it promotes trust because its primary purpose is to <i>give me recourse</i> after trust breaks down. I can try to take my money <i>back</i> from my account -- and if that doesn't work I can attempt to take it out of his insurance company, his auditors, or even people he has previously paid (look up <i>clawback</i> in the dictionary -- my accountant just explained it to me).",1237899060

530026,comment,529425,529751,0,0,gaius,,,"<i>Water restrictions are commonplace in Australia</i><p>A big part of Australia's long-term viability problem is <i>too much</i> water. Your farmers over-water their fields, washing out the nitrates into the sea, leaving the fields useless for growing crops and killing coral. Farming in Australia is more like mining, strip the resource then move on. Australia's problem is that it's bad at managing water, not that it has too little (as you later say).<p>In the UK our problem is that our water infrastructure was built by the Victorians, who were excellent engineers, but what they built has been badly maintained (to the extent that it was maintained <i>at all</i>) and we lose >25% of our water through leaks.",1237898318
530025,comment,528932,529934,0,0,dshen,,,"I'll comment on this as I wrote the post...<p>Coming outside the box is a great thing. If you're in a startup versus a big corporation, you're already enabled to work outside the box versus typically being stifled. My issue is that I've met entire teams who had, upon further conversation, skewed or incorrect impressions on how an industry worked. I think this is dangerous and will cause extra ""bobbing and weaving"" in their strategy, which costs them in time and money: money that an early stage startup doesn't have much of.<p>So I look at this as a probability game: you don't want to lower the odds of success by not really knowing how an industry works but raise it.  Some possible solutions are having advisors and being open to research, but I've also seen teams who didn't have resident founders not really act on advice or research.  It's much better to have a founder who has direct experience with that industry to be a daily, trusted member of the team pushing in the right direction constantly BUT you have to not be discouraged by the way an industry currently operates; you must have belief, focus, and drive to push disruption to change the rules of the industry you're attacking. What often happens with resident industry experts is that the team gets discouraged by all the barriers - to me this is the killer of an idea, not the knowledge.<p>Can you be a success without having a founder from the industry? Sure - look at Paypal who defied normal conventions of banking, amongst other really big examples of disruption. Let's just say there are many factors that drive success and that being disruptive is only one. Again, it's a probability game and you want to load the odds in your favor for success, not lower them...",1237898262

530023,comment,529822,529822,0,0,leftcoaster,,,"I don't find his argument particularly convincing.  He's assuming that the market can see that something that was open is now closed.  And while that might be true for an end user application, it's not at all true for libraries and frameworks that are folded into closed applications.<p>I'm the author of an LGPL-ed library.  It sees a modest amount of use and my goal in choosing that license is that any changes made to that library be shared back with the rest of the community.  It's not GPL-ed, so you don't have to share your application code, but if you change my library, you do have to share your changes/improvements.  If you don't want to share, then don't use my library.  Simple, right?<p>Well, every few months I get a note from someone who has noticed an application that doesn't meet this simple test. And I have to send them a dunning notice about the license violation. How many applications are there that I don't get notes about?  And absent a license, does anyone seriously think that the mass market would give up ""desirable application X"" because its creators were bad actors vis-a-vis some embedded library?",1237898185

530010,comment,529822,529822,0,0,trjordan,,,"I take issue with his argument that the free market punishes those who take code close sourced. The fundamental problem with open-source development is that it's always designed by committee. In most cases, this produces cleaner, faster, more robust code, but it's not true in every case. Open-source code has this tendency to get the basics right before improving the user experience, but if the standards and basics are fuzzy, the product never gets polished. Take OpenOffice - by trying to both copy MS and improve MS, it's no wonder the entire thing is a big bloated mess.<p>Some others have mentioned Apple as a counter-example, and I think they're dead on. By allowing BSD to be close-source forked, the market provided the economic incentive to allow Apple to run with it. They could then close a lot of the difficulties in an OS (arbitrary hardware setups, unwillingness to couple strongly to applications, etc.), and they've made an incredible product out of it. Philosophically, open-source would never make anything like OS X, because of the amount of vertical integration.<p>There isn't always incentive to move a project back to closed-source, and it's hard to argue that it's a long term strategy, but you can't say that the market universally crushes projects that aren't open-source.",1237896574

RMS, Eben Moglen, and others warned against this. I also recall thinking this was just some folks looking to monetize their GNU/Linux work.<p>The arguments about scale are interesting. For an IBM the GPL is just fine, they have the size to compete against anyone with value added services on top of Linux. For smaller, open source projects I've seen them prefer apache 2.0, I speculate because it encourages commercial growth. When you're IBM someone has to grow pretty big to pose a threat. For their other closed products they continue to enjoy great revenues. They can put the resources into keeping them best of breed.<p>At the end of the day I believe the GPL best serves the rights of individual programmers and a moral argument can be made that software, just like mathematics, should be free.

It should allow people to see trajectories and compare differences between what was predicted before, and the articles written in that particular year.  <p>Even better (but almost too hard), if given the historical trajectories and how the graph of technologies enable each other, you can give prediction accuracy scores to current articles about the future.",1196953065

86626,comment,86506,86506,0,0,ivankirigin,,,"I liked the article, but thought the note about the communist party not being Communist was a bit naive. It has <i>always</i> been this way: every communist country has been ruled by dictators who like power. Only the useful idiots in the west believed the ideology.<p>The ending note is interesting. I'd like to hear more about expectations of change in China. The growth of a middle class could help out a lot. The inevitable failure of the Great FireWall will help.<p>The biggest push will probably come from the top, as insightful leaders see the need for independent thinking and creativity -- the opposite of rote memorization.",1196951985

86623,comment,86509,86509,0,0,fauigerzigerk,,,"There are two types of muck though: \nMuck that cannot be avoided and becomes a hard problem that must be solved => brass.\nMuck for which there is a known way to avoid it, and solving it is just a short term fix with shrinking demand => legacy.<p>Data cleansing/integration is an example for the first kind of muck. I believe on-premises server-side software belongs in the second muck category. As a startup, think hard before you do it!<p>",1196951818

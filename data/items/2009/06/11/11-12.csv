A lightning storm affected something on the ""inside"" of the UPS, but nothing else in the datacenter? I'm curious how that would even happen (and shouldn't a lightning rod be in use?).<p>Also, it seems like Google's per-motherboard UPS system would have been the setup to have in order to avoid this problem in the first place.",1244719654

I really thought that the reason why google cared to appeal this case was because the court of claims decided that google can not terminate an account without giving the reasons for doing so. That I would assume, is quite a significant decision for google, bearing in mind the way they currently operate. If that was the case, and if I was this guy, I would take it up to the Supreme court just on that one point and nothing else.",1244718589

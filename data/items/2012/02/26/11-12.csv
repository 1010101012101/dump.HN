3635423,comment,3635085,3635290,4,0,almost,,,"With a RESTful API you don't tend to need IDs most of the time, you just use URLs. So having all the versioning info in the URL is not so great, you change the version and suddenly all the URLs aren't valid anymore.<p>But more important that is upgrading a version on an API may not be an all or nothing thing. You might want to start using the new features of the API on one resource type but you aren't ready to upgrade your usage on everything else. If the version is in the API you'll have to take apart and put back together urls to get the right ones, this is logic you don't want to have to encode into your client. If on the other hand you use Accept headers to do versioning you can have as fine grained control as you need.<p>Regarding the custom HTTP verbs it may seem like you need those at first but in practice you really don't and there is almost always a good clean way of doing things that doesn't break anything (or so I've found). I find that the solution is usually to introduce another resource or two, the transactions example from the article is a perfect example of this.<p>I know it sometimes seems like this is all abstract stuff that has no impact on the real world but it does make sense eventually! It's really lovely to use a properly RESTful API :)",1330257383

Can anyone follow through on why PATCH vs PUT is better?<p>Assume I'm stupid.<p>Explain to me, but don't stop at ""because it's more compliant to the HTTP Standard"" / ""because thus it has been written in the scriptures"" mustn't be the fundamental reason to do something.<p>Similarly, ""it is Good to be compliant with the HTTP Standards in this case, because in other cases it was Good also""--certainly I can understand that being compliant with the 200 and 404 status code is a Good Thing.<p>But is there any other, tangible reason why a Rails project would benefit from now using PATCH instead of PUT? Some interoperability with another existing framework maybe? Or interoperability with a hypothetical future framework? What other kinds of software would need to be changed and used before it'll provide a tangible benefit to a Rails project that uses PATCH vs a Rails project using PUT?<p>BTW I'm not arguing against standards (I know, I said you may assume I'm stupid, but no need to go all out ok?), I'm just genuinely curious if there is <i>any</i> other benefit, real, future, hypothetical or imaginary, other than ""it's more compliant, and being compliant is good"".<p>Actually even if that <i>is</i> the only reason, that's nice, it makes things neater and that's also good.

Learning is a journey (takes a some/lot of time).\n(expertise is 10 000 hours of work/experience)<p>What is good about learning is there are levels (ie. beginner, intermediate, advanced). For the software/app maker, it means there are different needs to answer. For your potential user, it may mean, there is a potential long term gratification ""I am a beginner user today, and tommorrow I can become an advanced user"". ""I can make progress.""<p>- How to make your visitors sin up ? \nBreak down the different japanese apprenticeship levels. Show your user, examples of instant gratification. Even if they are beginner, they can get something.<p>- How to make your users stay and use your app ? \nGratification at every little step they make. ie. Every time they write a good answer.<p>In other words, I think adding a layer of gamification would be interesting for you. It would spark your visitors interest, grow your user's engagement.<p>- How to make people come ?\nMaybe by allowing your users to challenge their friends. Ervery time your user reach a milestone, allow him to post on Twitter/Facebook something like this : ""In two weeks, I allready completed X,Y,Z levels of Japanese. What about you ?"" (far from perfect, but you get the point).<p>Having a freemium business model is a good idea. It lowers the barrier entry for the user.<p>In addition to that:\n- Define the the user tipping point : when are they addicted. What does it means to be addicted to your app. \n- Define the right metrics to analyze.<p>Many startups in the learning industry have successfully implemented a gamification layer in their application. \nYou may take a look at codecademy.com and veri.com<p>HTH and Good luck.<p>PS: Great ratings show you're into something.",1330256817

Over time the fines even change social norms about littering and the situation improves in areas without the fines.  The analogy to copyright is pretty weak.

I think it's often (but not always) more effective to breeze through less important tasks that you're itching to do instead of slowly trudging along the highest priority task that you detest. The unpleasant topmost task becomes much less daunting once you've built momentum with a few easy wins and can see yourself as a producer instead of a procrastinator.<p>There's also the idea of structured procrastination, [1] which turns procrastination into a productivity tool. It's based on the insight that an unpleasant task may become attractive when seen as a way to procrastinate on something even more unpleasant. For a true procrastinator it means working productively on tasks #2..n instead of reading Hacker News thinking ""one last article and then I'll start working on task #1"". It's an excellent way to avoid getting stuck in a vicious cycle of procrastination, and calling it ""hidden procrastination"" is unnecessarily negative.<p><a href=""http://www.structuredprocrastination.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.structuredprocrastination.com/</a>",1330254665

Take  for instance. I while the second stroke was well off it accepted that while rejecting the third stroke for not bending back enough way at the end.<p>Since algorithmic solution is rather hard I might actually suggest going a whole different direction.\nIf you've ever tried applications like Anki, they ask the user herself to select the result, which to me seems to work fairly well.\nThe least I would want is probably some kind of intermediate level in between Good and Wrong.<p>Hope it helps and good luck!",1330254578

10445460,comment,10436466,10445361,0,0,insoluble,,,"I agree with most of what you&#x27;ve said here. A generic occupation such as &quot;physicist&quot; or &quot;programmer&quot; allows for a broad array of possibilities, many of which don&#x27;t require more than ~100 in IQ. For example, making Excel spreadsheets to convert test grades into a final grade is quite easy, despite technically being &quot;programming&quot;. A huge contrast is found when comparing that with writing a 3D or physics engine. The difference in IQ requirement could be 85 versus 125. My hypothetical scenario were better with a more specific occupation, having a higher requirement, but I didn&#x27;t find any better data than that on the link I posted.<p>An important factor to consider with all this is the rate with which a particular person could learn or carry out such a job&#x27;s activities. There is a reason why retarded people (IQ < 70) are called &quot;slow&quot;, and that&#x27;s because they learn at a much slower rate compared to persons of 100 IQ. If you tried hard enough, you could probably get a person of 70 IQ to remember some physics equations, but (a) it would take a really long time, (b) they would not truly comprehend the nature or derivations of the equations, and (c) they would probably be very poor at recognising when to apply a given equation, let along actually applying it. The point is, they would be completely unable to compete in the job market. And this phenomenon is by no means exclusive to &quot;retards&quot;. There are many concepts for which a person of average intelligence would seem retarded at trying to understand, and this could probably apply to persons at any level of intelligence.<p>A final note is that job requirements, both in terms of education and intelligence, are always changing. Due to advances in technology, some jobs are far easier than they used to be, while others have become much more intellectually demanding. Programming, for example, is much easier than it used to be -- as a result of new IDEs, new programming languages, and more system resources. On the other hand, I imagine being an auto mechanic requires more brains now than in the past. Generally speaking, the easier the task or job is (intellectually), the more likely it is to be replaced by automation and or robotics.",1445733860

Even moreso for those with traditional &quot;disadvantages&quot; like being considered too old. Keep up with trends, keep reading those whitepapers, go back and review the basics every so often (this is a good idea anyway, IMO), learn at least the basics of the new whiz-bang thing that comes out (even if it&#x27;s just the &quot;hello world&quot; equivalent), and generally keep yourself &quot;interview ready.&quot;<p>3) Physical appearance matters. They may not be able to ask your age, but they can look at you, and they&#x27;ll form an opinion whether it&#x27;s conscious or subconscious. Though many find it distasteful, it is the reality. That means consider carefully whether smoking/alcohol/other intoxicants that affect your physical appearance are worth it. It also behooves you to keep a regular exercise schedule. Cosmetic surgery is also an option; there are many tells for age you can fix: eyelid and eyebrow droop, under-eye and various other facial lines, hanging chin. Hair dye and grafts are also worth considering, as a receded hairline and whites/grays are obvious tells.<p>4) It probably goes without saying to keep up your professional network.<p>5) Another distasteful one, but perhaps worth thinking about: if you&#x27;re someone who is in the age bracket that is often considered &quot;very likely to have a family&quot;, but you don&#x27;t (especially if you don&#x27;t ever plan to), state it. Signaling that you don&#x27;t have large, difficult-to-discharge obligations could give you the edge you need. You may get mentally re-bracketed.

In release mode, integer overflow is unchecked. It&#x27;s not &quot;undefined behavior&quot; in the C sense, because of the fact that it always returns a value--there are no nasal demons possible here (Rust disallows UB in non-`unsafe` code entirely, because memory unsafety is a subset of nasal demons). The exact value that it returns is unspecified, and the language provides no guarantee of backward compatibility if you rely on it (it also provides explicit wrapping arithmetic types if you explicitly desire wrapping behavior). And though it&#x27;s a potential correctness hazard if you don&#x27;t do any testing in debug mode, it&#x27;s not a memory safety hazard, even in the unchecked release mode, because Rust&#x27;s other safety mechanisms prevent you from using an integer like this to cause memory errors.",1445732152

Your other points were sensible and lucid. This was a distraction and had the paradoxical effect of making me more sympathetic to github. The same looks to be true of other posters in this thread.<p>If you were consciously choosing to take a hyperbolic tone, can I ask if you might reconsider that decision in future posts?

And I agree, that is pretty much what it is.  However, won't the Mac App Store do the same thing in GUI form?  Will there be apps you can install with homebrew (or other pm's like it) that you can't install with the app store, or vise versa?  Is the Lion eventually going to eat homebrew?",1287853197

1823863,comment,1821406,1823678,0,0,jeromec,,,"I think you're overlooking the work and talent that goes into producing this (Emmy Award-winning) show. Here is an excerpt from an article that takes a look at the behind-the-scenes routine to making a typical episode:<p><i>For the next hour, Stewart paces diagonally across a windowless eight-by-eight-foot room, sucking on an iced coffee and grabbing handfuls of candy. Projected in front of him on one wall is the current script; beneath it, at two keyboards, sit Kristen Everman, a production assistant, and Kira Klang Hopf, an indefatigable senior producer. Head writer Steve Bodow and executive producers Josh Lieb and Rory Albanese perch on small couches. As the studio audience files into its seats down the hall and tonight’s musical guests, Arcade Fire, tune their guitars in the greenroom, Stewart and his team go on a nonstop, rapid-fire jag that tears up and rewrites nearly three-quarters of the script. The typist transcribes, cuts, and pastes; as visual gags pop feverishly into Stewart’s brain, Hopf calls down to the art department, ordering up new video montages and a collage of an “Anchor-Me Terror Baby” to go with a reference to the “birthright citizenship” debate. Many of the new ideas will be scrapped only moments later. ... As Stewart speeds along, hours of work by writers and producers are cut, replaced by improvised digressions.</i><p><a href=""http://nymag.com/arts/tv/profiles/68086/index4.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://nymag.com/arts/tv/profiles/68086/index4.html</a>",1287852966

1823855,comment,1823405,1823405,0,0,ajg1977,,,"If you really do want to be a professional game programmer then I'd recommend biting the bullet and starting with C. It's a fundamental requirement for programmer at any game studio, and it's absolutely the closest interface you can get to the low-level workings of a machine without resorting to assembly. Learning about the heap, pointers, arrays, addresses and offsets isn't particularly fun, but neither is it particularly hard. I would be far more likely to employ a junior or intern with a solid understanding of these concepts, than someone with a fancy python graphics demo but who couldn't implement strlen()<p>That said, if you do want to dip your toe in the water and figure out if programming is for you, I'd really disagree with the suggestion of using Python as your language, particularly if your intention is to later focus on C/C++. Python is great, but its structure and constructs do not map particularly well to those languages. A better first step would C# (native on Windows, Mono on other platforms). In most ways its syntax is virtually identical to C++ and shares the same project and compile/run concepts. If you are using Windows, you'll also be using a best in class debugger and the same environment as you would in C/C++.",1287852812

At first he tried to convince me to work in exchange for a percentage of the company, but when I refused he said he would pay me cash.<p>I built the site but never trusted him to pay me so I included a ""delete script"" that would erase all the code on every html page of the website when a set of three unique parameters were passed to a specific page of the site in a URL.<p>When I was nearly finished with the site he suddenly called to tell me he was on a plane to meet investors and needed me to upload the site to his live server ""immediately"" so he could do a demo in a few hours.  I uploaded it just as he asked, and then he seemed to become invisible or unavailable for more than a week.  Hmmm ...<p>After many unsuccessful attempts trying to get him to respond to my calls and emails I finally decided to trigger my delete code.  He called within the hour to ask what I might have done to ""his"" website.<p>I told him he does not own the website because it was still mine until he paid for it. He claimed that I had agreed to wprk in exchange for a percentage of the company, and I laughed.<p>Eventually he asked if I had a copy of the website that I could send him if he paid me, and an hour after I said ""yes"" the full amount appeared in my bank account.<p>I sent him new copies of the html files (without my delete script) and thankfully I never heard from that dishonest unethical opportunistic client ever again.<p>Lesson learned:  Never trust a programming client to do what he promises, even when it is in writing.<p>From that point on I have always asked my clients to prepay for my programming labor.  Most of them complain at first, but I give them a discount when they prepay, and that's usually enough to convince them to trust me to do what I say I will do -- instead of me trusting them to pay me later.<p>When they learn that I'm honest and always send a refund when they overpay, they never complain about my payment system again ... but they really appreciate the price break I give them when they prepay.",1287851832

From the perspective of copyright law, yes, it can be classified as quoting, so they can't sue google, but those ""headlines and teasers"" do carry news value and in some cases took large amount of resources to produce. Now, Google took it and provided link as a payoff. Is that payoff adequate? Murdoch and many news producers don't think so.'<p>This seems very much the same as walking past a newsstand, glancing at the headlines of assorted newspapers and magazines, perhaps flipping through one or two, to see what's happening.   The stand owner is  ""giving away"" the headlines, but how else are people going to know about the publications?<p>By similar logic, a newsstand owner should have to pay just to place a newspaper on display.   Where has Murdoch been all those years while this robbery was occurring?",1255294774

875267,comment,874902,875078,0,0,ubernostrum,,,"What is interesting to me is the inconsistency in the arguments of big-L libertarians, which basically boils down to claiming that self-interest will turn into a virtuous result when a person's job title is ""corporate executive"" but a vicious result when the job title is ""Congressman"".<p>In theory, democracy should exploit the same effects as unregulated or lightly-regulated capitalism: politicians act in their self-interest (pursuing power, prestige, etc.) but in order to do so must provide tangible benefits to voters in order to keep getting elected.<p>In reality, of course, politicians run all sorts of schemes on the side to their own personal benefit, but to the detriment of the larger body of voters. In much the same way, executives run all sorts of schemes on the side to their own personal benefit, but to the detriment of the larger body of shareholders in their company (the analogue of the voters).<p>Yet in the politician's case this is heralded as a failure of government, and little additional discussion takes place (since the presumption before the fact was that government must always fail); in the executive's case all manner of arguments are advanced to try to explain that it is not a failure of capitalism (since the presumption before the fact was that capitalism must never fail).<p>In a very real sense, then, this turns into the fallacy of begging the question: capitalism does not fail because it is postulated that capitalism does not fail, and government fails because it is postulated that government fails.",1255294513

875263,comment,875106,875217,0,0,nostrademons,,,"Say that I wasn't happy with the salary that Google is paying me.  It's a good salary, but I want more.  After all, my labor has already generated more revenue for the company than I am likely to make in my lifetime.  I, of course, don't <i>have</i> to work with Google - I can quit at any time.  But in reality I can't, since my competition is also willing to work for the same wages and I have to eat.  So I have to play by Google's rules, even if I believe they don't pay me enough for the value I am making.<p>Do you have much sympathy for me?<p>Why, then, do you have much sympathy for Rupert Murdoch and his billion-dollar corporation?<p>It's an analogy, and like all analogies, it's imperfect.  But it's perhaps more apt than you'd expect.  You might argue that I could easily quit and get a job at, say, Yelp or Facebook.  But News Corp could easily block Google and form a partnership with Yahoo or Microsoft - heck, there's rumors that they are doing just that.  Or you could say that I should quit and form my own business - well, News Corp could easily go hire a crack team of 100 programmers to build their own indexing engine.  Except they probably won't find the good ones, since everything indicates that Google is a better place for a computer scientist to work than News Corp.<p>You might also argue that I'm already paid for my labor.  Well, News Corp is already paid for the their headlines and their brief teasers: they're paid when people visit their page and advertisers put up money for that privilege.  They just want to be paid <i>more</i>.  It's not all that different from me wanting a higher salary because I generate far more value to the company than I cost.",1255294348

They told us not to worry if we don't make the top 5 since they don't really think that hard about who should make the top 5 anyway.<p>What's funny is that their investment size is typically around $100k.

It's unclear how without the limits set by the JSON spec that literal Javascript would have become a popular exchange format.<p>It took Crockford's Rebol-influenced eye to spot the potential for a minimalist though somewhat expressive exchange format based on elementary block structures, and near-genius to carve it out of the spartan confines of the Javascript syntactic swamps. Sadly not being Rebol, JSON does not include words (see 'Reserved Words' <a href=""http://javascript.crockford.com/survey.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://javascript.crockford.com/survey.html</a>), dates, urls, email addresses (see <a href=""http://www.rebol.com/rebolsteps.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.rebol.com/rebolsteps.html</a>); and will forever be burdened with comma-delimiters.",1367752242

Its this simple really, I want a 100GB heap with no tuning.  That will never happen on the JVM, Since Im not a lisper I dont know what the implications for memory management are, but having lived with JVM GC for over a decade Im done with it and hardware has surpassed JVM's ability to keep up.  If it was still a 32 bit world I would have a different opinion.  But Im not going to distribute tons of code to clusters just to avoid GC pauses, give me 100GB heap or give me death.",1367751986

They really manage to hit this sweet-spot between VPS and shared hosting, and you get the best of both worlds.<p>You get lots of stuff out of the box with an easy web-based interface[1], but if you really need some specific version or a package, you can do it too. Their support is fast and responsive and very helpful. They have servers in the US, Amsterdam and Singapore, and you can choose. You can even set up a fail-over server[2] quite easily.<p>I know I sound like a fanboy, but I truly like their service. Of course, for most of my stuff, I still use Linode/AWS, but can't recommend webfaction enough for shared hosting.<p>[1] e.g. you can choose the PHP version for your app from their web management console, as well as lots of predefined app templates (django, wordpress, RoR and more)<p>[2]<a href=""http://blog.gingerlime.com/2012/webfaction-fail-over/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.gingerlime.com/2012/webfaction-fail-over/</a> - a blog post I wrote about it.",1367751869

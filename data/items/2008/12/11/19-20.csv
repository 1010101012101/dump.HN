394649,comment,394442,394599,0,0,mechanical_fish,,,"<i>they're generally less forgiving of ugly, needlessly hacked-together systems...</i><p>Huh? Am I the only one who finds Subversion to be <i>very</i> confusing, at the conceptual level, compared to git? All that file-by-file history tracking, just waiting to trip you up when you try to move a file around? The fact that branching in SVN is hopelessly entangled with the concept of <i>copying directories</i> around in some remote repository?  Here's the canonical example from the SVN book:<p><pre><code>  svn copy http://svn.example.com/repos/calc/trunk \\n           http://svn.example.com/repos/calc/branches/my-calc-branch \\n      -m ""Creating a private branch of /calc/trunk.""\n</code></pre>\nI guess I must be the only one who prefers:<p><pre><code>  git clone git://github.com/mechfish/calc\n  cd calc\n  git branch my-calc-branch\n  git checkout my-calc-branch\n  # ... fiddle around, then when it's time to go back to master ...\n  git checkout master   # note: no need to cd anywhere\n</code></pre>\nI suppose that one downside of this is that all your coworkers <i>don't</i> get to automatically see the my-calc-branch on their centralized server. (How terrible it is that your every whim isn't being automatically published to the world!) Instead, when you want to push changes, you have to say something like this:<p><pre><code>  git push origin my-calc-branch:refs/heads/my-calc-branch\n</code></pre>\nOr you have to set this up a bit in advance:<p><pre><code>  git config branch.my-calc-branch.remote origin\n  git config branch.my-calc-branch.merge refs/heads/my-calc-branch\n</code></pre>\nAfter which you can just do<p><pre><code>  git checkout my-calc-branch\n  git push\n</code></pre>\nWhenever you want to push up the changes to my-calc-branch. This sort of incantation is not great, but that doesn't mean it can't or won't be improved, and it's not <i>that</i> big a price to pay.<p>The biggest problem with SVN is that <i>getting started</i> with it is so hard. As a git user, if I have a directory and I want it under version control, I do this:<p><pre><code>  cd my-directory\n  git init\n  git add *\n  git commit -m ""Initial commit""\n</code></pre>\nDone. Put this in a droplet script and your great-grandpa could do it. (He'd have to read some blogs to figure out what to do next, but at least it's a start. And even if all he knew how to do was this:<p><pre><code>  cd my-directory\n  git commit -a -m ""I committed today""\n</code></pre>\nand he did it every now and then, that would be great! Like a tiny, hidden, aperiodic, directory-specific version of Apple's Time Machine. His industrious great-granddaughter could use these snapshots to clean up after his PHP experiments...)<p>As an SVN user, you need to find a hosted repository, get admin permission on it, set up the canonical directory structure -- being <i>very careful</i> to heed these words from the SVN book (you did read the SVN book, right?):<p><i>While Subversion's flexibility allows you to lay out your repository in any way that you choose, we recommend that you create a trunk directory to hold the “main line” of development, a branches directory to contain branch copies, and a tags directory to contain tag copies.</i><p>... and then import your project, being sure to get it imported into /trunk and not into /trunk's parent. Then you have to check it out -- being sure to check out /trunk, or at least to do all your work in /trunk, lest you screw yourself up or confuse yourself.<p>So I assume that by ""ugly, needlessly hacked-together systems"" you mean ""systems that make you use the command line"". The only reason Subversion seems at all simple to non-geeks (to the extent that it does, which isn't much of an extent) is that the authors of tools like TortoiseSVN and Versions have sweated bucketloads of blood to design beautiful interfaces which hide all this cruft from the end users.

User comments on videos are actually intelligent.<p>Con's - Doesn't update as frequently as other sites.  UI is imprenetrable. I've never voted on anything.  I wouldn't know what to click.<p>Xvideos - Big player.<p>Pro's - Adds about 30 videos each day.  Crazy deep selection of videos.  Decent tagging system.  Related video algo is pretty good. UI is pretty ugly but serves its purpose.<p>Con's - Video's are slow to load. You can't skip through them without waiting for them to buffer all over again. Major performance issues here.<p>Megarotic - One of the big semi-pay sites.<p>Pro's - Incredible video selection.  Really good performance and playback.  Can scrub through the videos.<p>Con's - Costs money to watch more than 4 videos a day on their site.  Their video player is getting more and more proprietary, adding popup ads, massive popup controls and branding.<p>Fantasti.cc - This site's incredible.  Social network for porn and people looking for casual sex.  Rather than power their own videos they simply scrap embed codes from Xvideos, Pornub and Megarotic and tack on a slick UI and social networking features.  I think all this could be done with Drupal and a few modules.<p>Pro's - Well-designed.  Really nicely designed.  Enormous selection of videos by sucking in everything on other sites including xvideos, pornhub and youporn.  There's also an actual user community of people making collections of videos (a great feature I've not seen anywhere else, letting humans organize and categorize them into weird subsections like ""Chicks with flip - flops"").  Users review videos.  They also create user profiles where they post up amateur photos and video clips. The slick UI sets it all apart from other sites that do the same.<p>Cons - Because they steal from all the other free sites, videos disappear from the DB.  Also, performance is only as good as the sites they steal from.  I bet 60% of their content comes from XVideos...which means performance is often terrible.<p>Pornhub - Slick video site.<p>Pros - Well-organized.  Fast playback. Good selection.<p>Cons - Has the same videos as everyone else. Front page features stuff that people just watched, so you end up seeing the same clips over and over on the front page.<p>Conclusion from my own observations: There are loads of competitors.  The ability to scrub through videos is crucial but still not available on all sites.  Offering a simple UI is important but without advanced search or other organizing features like Fantasti.cc's wonderful user collections one risks losing users (I rarely go to redtube.  It's too basic and hard to find new stuff.)",1229022997

A conversation and a short written paragraph or two does the trick.  I agree that written documents can provide some clarity.<p>re: #2, ""Ensures token thought to key elements of a business"": If you need artificial structures to ensure that you think about something important, you're in trouble.  Sure, whip up a spreadsheet with some prices and churn numbers to get a sense of the scale you'll need for a SaaS offering.  Sure, poke around at ad rates in your vertical if you're going ad-supported.  But the key is thinking about it and learning about some of the realities-- not a formal document.<p>re: #4 ""a management/coordination tool"" - Huh?  In a 4 person business, people are going to refer to the business plan to know what they should be doing?  Naw, they should be referring to customer feedback, 1-page feature summaries, visual prototypes, notecard stories, and app/biz analytics....<p>The point of their gripe is that things change.  Dramatically.  You'll look back at the assumptions that are core to your business plan and laugh about how stupid you were (I know I would if I'd written one).  Some of the exercise is valuable-- to stretch muscles you're going to need (thinking about monetization, distribution, etc)...<p>But at the end of the day, it's usually akin to a virgin trying to write a sex manual-- no amount of research/planning is going to make it a good/accurate plan.",1229022093

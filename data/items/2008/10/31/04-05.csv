The whole references thing is frought with peril; I got tanked on (one, longshot) VC due diligence thing from a bad back-door reference. A friend of mine I recruited for a company I worked for got tanked on her back-door reference. She went on to be a total rock-star at the job she got instead of us.<p>On the other hand, I have stories about back-door references that were collected too late to avoid tragic mistakes.<p>You want to do both. The back-door reference is harder. The idea that you're getting real information from ""10-15"" fast reference checks from friends and family seems crazy.",1225429188
349663,comment,348774,348837,0,0,plinkplonk,,,"""I divided my work into two categories: what I had to do to ""feed the animal"" (busywork and formal requirements) and what was meaningful to me. The strategy was to minimize the former (not eliminate it - don't fight the beast, petting works better) and maximize the latter.""<p>This is my exact strategy at the day job. For a long time, I rebelled against the absurdities of corporate life and got into long and difficult fights to change the system.<p>These days I just use the system to maximize progress towards <i>my</i> goals  and minimally ""feed the beast"" exactly as gruesom pointed out above.<p>Imo, most managerial jobs can be handled in exactly the same way and can be used to further what you really want to do. (In my case I am working through ""Introduction to Algorithms"" (Cormen et al) in between meetings, memos and other management madness). One just has to be constantly aware of how much time and energy goes into which category of work.<p>I think of it like going to work at Arkham Asylum. You need to know what it takes to keep the Joker and the ScareCrow calm (or at least not ripping out your throat) while you save  a chunk of your  salary and work towards that startup. It is kind of fun in a ""play a strategy game"" kind of way. It also helps that I am mentally prepared to drop it all without a qualm, and walk away on a moments notice if it becomes necessary. Being single and having no family to support really helps here.<p>Great post gruesom!",1225429041

349655,comment,348975,349060,0,0,azanar,,,"How do you know that a back-door reference from someone they did not list would not poison the well on an otherwise qualified candidate? Perhaps the candidate is ill-placed enough at his current employer to be likely to garner a one or more middling reviews -- perhaps that is why he is looking elsewhere. It's possible that your corporate culture is sufficiently different that he can thrive, but how would you know?<p>Really the opposite could be said for references he provided; they'll sing his praises, even if he is a total dud.<p>Not saying references aren't extremely important, but I wouldn't mind some thoughts on getting past the apparent fragility in the process.",1225428204

Based on what?</i><p>I think it was the repetition of ""US ... election"" that gave me that impression, and in particular the inclusion of ""US"" in the construction.  As a US native, it probably wouldn't have occurred to me to include that modifier, so I guessed that you might not be American.<p><i>what makes this one so different?</i><p>Well, ""an election in the midst of two wars and a global financial crisis with the country's first black presidential candidate"", for starters.  Not to mention arguably America's lowest standing in the world since WWII. I remember seven elections and have voted in four, and (despite the ""historic"" claims four years ago) this one feels bigger than any of them.",1225428112

Based on what?<p>> In any case, and with my melodramatic invocation of ""love"" notwithstanding, it's perverse not to recognize that this is no ordinary election, regardless of which candidate you favor.<p>Perverse?  Every presidential election involves some ""leg tingling"", so what makes this one so different?<p>> And an election in the midst of two wars and a global financial crisis<p>World wars were bigger - were all those elections ""historic""?.  The Civil War was in the US - was 1864 ""historic""?<p>> with the country's first black presidential candidate is historic no matter how you slice it.<p>Racist :-)  (Didn't you get the memo?

Refinements in process that make it a little cheaper have been offset by higher energy costs. What Moore's law has done is make it possible to fit more and more transistors in the same space, not make the space cheaper.<p>I'm calling bull on this one. Photo-voltaic solar is still ruinously expensive and it will require more than incremental innovation to change this.",1225426690

There are strategic mergers with outfits like IBM and Fujitsu, but I don't think they are compelling enough... I think those will only really come about if Sun detonates and needs to be sold off - which I don't think is likely right now.<p>They also appear to have bypassed the whole ""cloud"" bit entirely. Even if you're skeptical on the cloud it might be a risk worth taking for Sun. It's a new market at least, and it's a growing market. They've got the hardware experience, Java and MySQL. These would all make a good basis for a cloud play.",1225426368

I'm 31 years old -- 32 in a month -- and while my daughter is at school, I spend the day programming, running errands, reading, chatting with RL friends via IRC, playing video games, browsing Reddit and HN.

I have never felt better about another person in my life.<p>I have no bills, I maintain a modest lifestyle and am attending university for a degree in a subject matter that simultaneously I love and will make me some extra money down the road when I need it.<p>Every day, I set my own schedule, fitted around picking up & dropping off my daughter at school. Beyond the normal stresses of being a single parent, my life is astoundingly, remarkably, wonderfully, joyously stress-free.

2515692,comment,2515404,2515404,14,0,grellas,,,"A few observations:<p>1. The lead plaintiff, Alki David, is a billionaire who was sued by CBS and other studios for allegedly infringing their copyrights with a digital streaming service. He is now funding this effort to paint CBS as a company that illegally induces others to infringe copyrights, that is liable as a contributory infringer, and that is responsible as a so-called vicarious infringer.<p>2. The plaintiff's counsel, Michael Zeller, once successfully defended AOL Time Warner against claims of contributory infringement for distributing the P2P client, Gnutella. He is now trying to make such a theory stick against CBS. This is no flaky lawyer. Mr. Zeller has represented Mattel, Google, and Disney in addition to AOL Time Warner and other big-name clients in IP-related litigation. He is distinguished in his field and highly respected.<p>3. The main line of attack here is based on <i>MGM v. Grokster</i>, the most recent leading U.S. Supreme Court case that dealt with contributory copyright infringement. Before <i>Grokster</i>, the law in this area focused on the nature of the product being challenged and, if a product was capable of a substantial, noninfringing use, a distributor was not contributorily liable for acts of copyright infringement by users of that product. In <i>Grokster</i>, the court shifted the analysis away from the product and over to the distributor's intent, holding that a distributor was liable for acts of copyright infringement committed by users of its product (even if the product was capable of a substantial, noninfringing use) if the distributor intended to induce the infringement. The complaint here tries to paint CBS as a party that is intentionally inducing the users of its download service to commit acts of copyright infringement. Given that the complaint does not seek to break new legal ground, CBS will likely need to defend it primarily on the evidence, which may ultimately put it in a tricky position of hoping that a possibly fickle jury will go its way.<p>4. The stakes for CBS can be high if it is potentially held liable for the damages caused by LimeWire. The damages being sought in that case run into the billions and the case is not going at all well for LimeWire. Already, the judge has entered rulings saying that the LimeWire founder can be personally liable for the wrongs, that expert evidence that sharing in fact helps content creators is to be excluded from consideration by the jury, and similar rulings that will likely lead the jury to enter a judgment for major damages (<a href=""http://paidcontent.org/article/419-limewire-trial-beginsjury-to-decide-how-much-labels-are-owed/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://paidcontent.org/article/419-limewire-trial-beginsjury...</a>). If, then, CBS is ultimately held liable as a party that illegally induced such infringements, it too may face a massive liability.<p>5. This case, then, has seedy elements, beginning with the revenge motive of the lead plaintiff, but it is a case that poses potentially serious risks for the defendants.",1304553220

They just didn't reward for quality.<p>A lot of expensive products are pure garbage, and in those cases, you certainly DON'T get what you pay for. The simplest example I can think of is HDMI cable. They cost $30/6ft at RadioShack when on sale, and $1/6ft at Amazon or MonoPrice. Customers pay RadioShack for it; what do they get?

Getting a CS student to code, a chemist to experiment, a physicist to experiment and a builder to build isn't hard.

Usually that doesn't happen, instead A) all equipment is kept away except during mandated times and for mandated purposes and B) they're held in classes and lectures long after they've gone ""Ok, cool. Let's play with this for a bit and we'll do more theory later"" so that they're pretty much sick of all of it at the end of the day. This is the most discouraging thing about the current system.

The marketing for Android devices is plastered with its name and logo. Not to mention, users are used to the PC ecosystem - your Dell Windows machine gets updates from Microsoft. So why doesn't your Samsung Android phone get updates from Google?<p>The <i>reality</i> is that, for many reasons, the OEMs and carriers have a death grip on device updates, but IMO this is entirely opposite to consumer expectation, and Apple will continue to ride this point to the bank until someone steps up and fixes it.<p>This reminds me of the way laptop video cards used to be. Your NVidia chipset (that your OEM has no problems advertising and slapping stickers on) will never get an update from NVidia. You have to get updated drivers from your OEM <i>only</i>. Naturally video cards never got updated, resulting in a gigantic compatibility nightmare. Eventually NVidia got the OEMs in line and now issues updates themselves. Google <i>must</i> do this if it wants Android as an ecosystem to have a future.",1304552078

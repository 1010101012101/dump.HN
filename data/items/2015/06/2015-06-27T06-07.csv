9789342,comment,9788198,9788198,0,0,daodedickinson,,,"A BIG problem is that the majority opinion posits marriage as a &quot;need&quot;. It can only become felt as a need through social construction and competition. This kind &quot;need&quot; talk has two effects: 1. More people love one other person instead of all equally. Those without a marriage or something approaching it feel worse unnecessarily especially in a well populated world. 2. Life needs can become rights. I don&#x27;t know if a right to marriage will occur, but there are can be a cycle with purely individualistic marriages on one hand and purely socialistic (arranged) marriages on the other. We&#x27;ve already seen awkward tech people wax nostalgiac about arranged marriages - you might think their birth rate would just solve any issue but the tech these people make remakes the youths in their image. There&#x27;s no logic to this process; it&#x27;s not a progression.<p>&quot;Satire, if it is to do any good and not cause immeasurable harm, must be firmly based on a consistent ethical view of life.&quot;<p>But we are addicted to satire for the sake of humor, that is, pleasurable neurological quirks that may win an argument in our minds and purely us in self-satisfied rest, but do not percieve or build an order.",1435387912

Certain problems need scalable, open, global public infrastructure, like global open system for identity, money, healthcare, energy research, climate data, etc.  Unfortunately, the current model of foundation philanthropy doesn&#x27;t fund these kinds of solutions well because the current charity funding model focuses on funding &quot;programmatic services&quot; (programs that service recipients directly). To put in more familiar HN terminology, foundations prefer to fund front-end services rather than back-end infrastructure. But Wikipedia cannot exist without http. And who funds the development of http-like projects?<p>With the growth of the Internet and the open-source movement, we, the tech industry, understand why open protocols and technology are crucial to providing access and opportunity to more people. I am a big believer in for-profit companies too, but there are certain things in tech that should be executed with a more philanthropic bent. When asked why Stellar.org is nonprofit, decentralized and open-source, we reply, &quot;Can you imagine if the Internet had been owned by a for-profit company?<p>The thesis of Parker&#x27;s post in the WSJ really struck a chord with me. There is a unique role that technologists can to play in philanthropy. We understand infrastructure and we should be funding the big tech bets that the world needs. Our industry is full of the unreasonable optimists - let&#x27;s take that optimism and invest in an unbelievable future:)",1435386771

Those are knowable quantities, and you can attack them systematically. Otherwise, everything is laid out for you in straight-line order. You can just read it and see &quot;this happens before that&quot; without having to run the program or a debugger, and nobody even has to burden themselves with giving &quot;this&quot; and &quot;that&quot; an explicit name(although a comment can be a real boost to finding what you want).<p>Codebases that are cleverly factored to within an inch of their life are much, much worse. There&#x27;s no guarantee that the original factoring successfully decoupled anything, and all the additional content allows for new bugs to slip in &quot;between the cracks&quot; - parameters left accidentally unset, a hierarchy of functions getting called in the wrong order, etc. The original programmer has to spend more time coming up with ways to name and enumerate these details, allowing their eyes and thoughts to be taken off of the domain problem. Because more powerful programming tools are used, more powerful debugging techniques become necessary. And when the architecture breaks, the call stacks just get deeper as the heavy metaprogramming guns are brought out to make increasingly clever workarounds to the resulting issues - after all, nobody really wants to try to disentangle the code after it hits the point of architectural meltdown.<p>Of the two, copy-paste coding is definitely the lesser evil.

You just put the Lisp server in a state where it refuses new connections (serves up a &quot;temporarily down for mx&quot; page, or reconfigure the ngingx front end to do that), wait for existing connections to finish, and then restart.  It&#x27;s no different from any other server.",1435385219

What do you think IPOs were?  Putting aside the craziness of the dotcom boom, this is basically what the public markets were doing 15 years ago.

As you note, the markets can manage this process provided they receive information, return and risk which are correlated with stage.  We don&#x27;t need a special term for this.

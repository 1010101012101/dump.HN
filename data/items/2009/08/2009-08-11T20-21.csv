Why?  Because the game market for the iPhone is HUGE and you can bet there will almost never be an issue with duplicate functionality or explicit content because a game can incidentally download the Karma Sutra.<p>Games account for about half of the top selling apps (12/25 last I checked), and some games are getting so many downloads they are getting installed on almost a third of all devices (Tap-tap revolution got to 30%).<p>The game market is huge and will continue to thrive.

Things like building high-tension powerlines or rezoning require many steps involving proposals, reviews, environmental impact studies, community input, etc. before final approval. There's also eminent domain, which I didn't mention, but again even that requires lots of review, justification, general consensus, and approval.<p>There is definitely a difference between those things and the government being able to arbitrarily seize your property with no justification at all, other than that you've arguably undervalued it, regardless of whether they pay you what you valued it at.<p>So, while this may not really give the government power that it doesn't already have per se, what it's doing is removing a ton of barriers.<p><i>Assuming you over-report the value, you'd be making a profit on the sale - enough that moving wouldn't be much of a issue for you.</i><p>This is assuming that all you care about is money.

756375,comment,755033,755950,0,0,gdp,,,"Deliberate hyperbole is not a ""lie"" in any sense of the word I understand, because it is not designed to deceive anyone.  It's generally done as an expression of hand waving.  You are being deliberately imprecise, either because you genuinely don't know the real value (in which case ""guessing"" would be presenting a deceptive level of precision which you do not actually have), or for humorous effect - to make a point more emphatically.<p>The laptop example used below is good.  Saying ""this weighs a ton!"" is much less deceptive than if I took a guess and said ""this weighs 2 kilograms"".  It obviously doesn't weigh a ton, because its density would probably exceed that of all known elements.  Saying it weighs a ton has two connotations:  1) That I don't know how much it weighs (or it is irrelevant to the conversation) and 2) I am finding it difficulty to carry because its weight is beyond that which I can carry comfortably.  Saying ""this weighs 2 kilograms"" does not convey the same information.<p>Similarly, making an overstatement like ""Gimp's UI makes me go blind"" is clearly not designed to deceive anyone.  It is physically impossible that Gimp's UI would have made a person go blind.  The person saying this is not asking you to believe it, instead, he is saying ""I find Gimp's UI very visually unappealing, and <i>the reasons for this are not important right now</i>).<p>So, in summary, hyperbole is not the same as lying.  Lying is not ""anything that is untrue"", lying is <i>deception</i>, and the suggestion of deliberate deception where none exists is quite offense to most people!",1250023939

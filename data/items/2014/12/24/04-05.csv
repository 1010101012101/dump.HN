From <a href=""http://www.ianbicking.org/blog/2014/09/professional-transitions.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ianbicking.org/blog/2014/09/professional-transiti...</a>:<p>&quot;Note that Mozilla Labs is distinct from Mozilla Research – Research is the home of projects like Rust and ASM.js. Mozilla Research is still going strong. To make a broad distinction between the two groups: Research has worked on foundational technologies for the web, especially related to programming languages, while Labs was product-focused. Also Research has been led by Brendan Eich and now David Herman, with what appears to be a fairly clear vision and succession. Labs was led by a number of people with different interests and different visions – some people with an eye to external validation, some looking to spur disruptive (also uncomfortable) changes in Mozilla, some hoping to enable and include external contribution.&quot;<p>> It&#x27;s interesting to see Shumway on there as I was under the impression the project was put on hold.<p>Shumway is definitely under active development.

So here&#x27;s what I got out of that link: a blast furnace is something like a 10-story can, lined with fancy insulating bricks and a ton of embedded pipes for water-cooling so that the insulation doesn&#x27;t melt. On the outside are a bunch of walkways and vents and ducts and pipes and stuff just like a scene out of <i>Terminator</i>.<p>You chuck various rocks (iron ore, limestone, coal) into this multi-story brew and they gradually react with each other (the mixture heats itself) as you blow oxygen into openings at the bottom. Over a period of <i>weeks</i> the iron sinks to the bottom (and the waste sinks close to the bottom but not quite) where you extract it. Once or twice a decade you might stop making steel and empty it all out so you can replace the bricks and do maintenance.<p>If you let it get too cold, the iron and the waste (slag) will freeze and clog the vents, so you drill into it with &quot;a long, consumable, steel tube fed with pressurised oxygen gas&quot; - it&#x27;s not like you have heating coils built in, you just toss the fuel in with the rest of the stuff. I guess this is also why the &quot;chilled hearth&quot; at the bottom is such a problem (the point of having a blast furnace is that it&#x27;s mostly-iron that collects down there, not fuel). Of course, the frozen steel and slag is still insanely hot, just <i>solid</i> now. On the other side of problem-land: if the cooling system leaks and too much water gets in, the whole thing might explode and jump about 2 or 3 feet in the air (this &quot;too much water&quot; is on the order of tons, mind you -- this can happen if parts of the cooling system <i>melts</i>).<p>Yeesh. I&#x27;d been thinking they&#x27;d lost something an order of magnitude or so smaller -- more like the size of a cement mixer.<p>And of course each of your top experts (water systems, electrical systems, etc) might want to go home before the 10+ year campaign is over, so you install remote monitoring and if there&#x27;s a crisis you call the top expert and he can take a look at it and provide advice instead of getting up and spending half an hour to drive there and <i>then</i> give advice (possibly a very useful capability in many other crises)...",1419395870

While they are happening less today, we have much greater visibility of the horrors that do happen. And they still horrify us – as they should. This gives us motivation to strive harder to eliminate them altogether. The jarring thing about looking at those charts is the labels on the y axis – murder, war, genocide, rape, child abuse. It&#x27;s certainly good that they are trending down, but how much genocide is ok? How much rape is acceptable? Perhaps our natural fixation with the dark side of life is a good thing.

That&#x27;s not exactly exciting news.<p>The first half of the twentieth century revealed the contradiction of modernity: the terrible brutality of the industrial processes (including mechanized war) which underlay a system that on the surface had brought forth so much prosperity. The period since has been an attempt to resolve this contradiction through new tactics (specifically information and communication technologies) which allow the &#x27;necessary&#x27; application of power&#x27;s blunt end to be as precise as possible.<p>&quot;Wars were never as bloody as they have been since the nineteenth century, and all things being equal, never before did regimes visit such holocausts on their own populations. But this formidable power of death – and this is perhaps what accounts for part of its force and the cynicism with which it has so greatly expanded its limits – now presents itself as the counterpart of a power that exerts a positive influence on life, that endeavors to administer, optimize, and multiply it, subjecting it to precise controls and comprehensive regulations. Wars are no longer waged in the name of a sovereign who must be defended; they are waged on behalf of the existence of everyone; entire populations are mobilized for the purpose of wholesale slaughter in the name of life necessity: massacres have become vital.&quot; - Michel Foucault",1419394874

Guantanamo and Abu Ghraib are examples. Because these people are only tortured, and not murdered, is that considered &quot;peaceful&quot;?<p>And it also would depend on how far back you draw the data from. Is the Stalin famine of the 30s modern, or ancient? If we cast the data back to the 1600s, it&#x27;s new. If we cast the data back to the 1920s, its old.<p>Some data sets in this article go back to the 60s, some go back to the 30s, some only back to the 90s. Maybe we need more data. Lets cast all the data sets back a few hundred years and look again.<p>Consider me unconvinced.",1419393668

You still hear him talk about it in interviews today. If I&#x27;m not mistaken a similar thing happened to the creator of batman. While public domain doesn&#x27;t give Moore back his rights, I&#x27;m sure he&#x27;ll rest a little easier knowing DC doesn&#x27;t own his series anymore.",1419393635

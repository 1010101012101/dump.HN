2594242,comment,2591845,2591845,1,0,DisposaBoy,,,"I couldn't find any way of contacting the author or leaving a comment(except on twitter) so commenting here...<p>Before I start I must say it would have been nice if a proper set-up was done for the screenshots, white-marks(censor) on the images just distract from the point you're trying to make.<p>I personally disagree with some of these points...<p>on point #2<p>> Class definitions should not result in the execution of any code, period. Whether or not that warrants a syntax error is up for debate, but that code does not look very constant from here and is some-sort-of an error in my view.<p>on point #37<p>> `""a"" . ""b""` doesn't make sense as useful code... `__DIR__ . ""/file""` could be useful, but as already argued, it's not a constant and therefore should not be getting any special treatment. If it did, then I'd consider it a bug - as it leads to more inconsistency, ambiguity and bugs.<p>on point #8<p>> I guess we could argue this one all day. Personally I don't think it should ever return true as an object is not an array and vice versa. likewise, property_exists should not work on an array(). It's documented that array_key_exists no longer works with objects as-of php 5.3, whether or not id did before that I don't know. I can't really think of a use-case for that function when you have isset().<p>on point #18<p>> I think this one can go either way, for what purpose is a static variable useful on an object instance?<p>on point #33<p>> I feel so strongly about this one that I think it should be removed entirely. Unlike the other points I don't think this one is open for discussion in any case. I simply can't understand why this code should <i>ever</i> be valid. It completely goes against the point of OO and information hiding. You'll take care to note that it works as expected if you make it <i>protected</i> as opposed to <i>private</i>. That's the idea of having private <i>and</i> protected. Furthermore, you say pretty much the same thing. In the code, it does override it - no question. Call `$obj->b();` and see what happens. The reason you think it doesn't work is because `a()` unless overriden, is comes from `class super` and is therefore tied to `class super`. In other words, it's never supposed to work...<p>on point #41<p>> Yeah... I don't get it.<p>on point #28<p>> I'm pretty sure empty() is not a function which renders the rest of the point moot. Inconsistent behaviour? I think so. Again with the function chaining and need for a temporary variable. Provide snippets if you can, please. Otherwise it's hard to understand things from your POV.<p>The whole bugs section is moot - they're bugs and are therefore implementation dependent - i.e has nothing to with the language.<p>on point #11<p>> This isn't so-much a disagreement so I'll use it to ask what's up with the numbering... Anyway I don't understand the part about memory use - I wouldn't be surprised if the memory-use on the main page increased more than 30KiB simply   by including that point. So in theory, leaving it out would in-fact be saving memory :p<p>on point #14<p>> I think it's a good thing, in the same vein on throwing in destructors. It's not funny in C++ and it damn sure ain't funny in PHP either.<p>on point #38<p>> I think that's a good thing - if you know you can't catch a fatal error then if forces you to write better code.<p>on point #20<p>> I must admit that I've never seen use of `\e` for this - only `\033` and `\x1b`.<p>on point #35<p>> It shouldn't - that's like setting a bear trap in from of your doorway and then go out to get drunk so you can come back and step on it.<p>on point #26<p>> Maybe it makes sense to me coming from C/C++ and GCC but E_STRICT doesn't report errors and therefore doesn't belong in E_ALL. Contrast GCC's `-Wall` and `-Wall -Wextra`",1306578164

Nginx's strength is handling tens of thousands of concurrent connections with very little incremental CPU load and a tiny memory footprint. It then reverse proxies those connections to a threaded-model server occupying each thread for very little time and quickly freeing them up for other work.<p>From what I gather, varnish uses a threaded model with 1 thread per connection which is what nginx solves. So it might make sense to put nginx in front of varnish so you get high concurrency with great caching.<p>Nginx does offer some caching but I've played with it in high load environments and wasn't impressed with the performance.",1306577244

The top 2 tech companies by market cap have Billions of dollars in cash on hand because they sell OS's (among other things).

It's really simple -- no web UI for me (yet, anyway), and the whole thing is contained in a few hundred lines of code.<p>That said, I already like it better than Wordpress.  (Which I was using before.)  I don't have comments, but I didn't want them anyway.  People have written Wordpress plugins for virtually every need I might ever have, but plugins are a pain to deal with for problems that I can now solve in 3 lines of code.",1190560364

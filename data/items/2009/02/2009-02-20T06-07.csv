Last weekend's sale resulted in a 3000% increase over relatively flat numbers. It sold more last weekend than when it launched the game. WOW. That is unheard of in this industry. Valve beat its launch sales. Also, it snagged a 1600% increase in new customers to Steam over the baseline.""<p>and<p>""6:56 PM - Looking at a third-party game, it saw increases of 36,000% with a weekend sale. Oh. Em. Gee.

They either have already a job, or they are doing their own apps + some contracting on the side.<p>But the market is affecting some people.  My previous company is having about 2% raises achross the board  (last year was about the same), and they are underpaying most developers,  and they can pull it off, as the market has cooled off, and there are less options out there.<p>The funny thing, is that the company is thinking that is gaining by having little raises, but i know from a fact that a lot of people are just working less, and are in a don't care mode/will do just enough not to get fired mode.",1235112757

You'd be surprised how many large companies that could easily afford to optimize their processes just don't do it.<p>You find dedicated people (or even departments) doing nothing but strictly repetitive tasks. Things like filing invoices, keeping a stock of parts according to a set of rules or even, like you said, aggregating always the same information and mailing it in always the same format to the execs.<p>In every company that I have worked so far there were quite a few people who could have literally been replaced by the proverbial shell-script.<p>Doing so (when appropiate) always gives you an edge because you'll be faster and less prone to errors in that area than the meatbag-driven competitor - plus you free up ressources for more interesting tasks.",1235112536

488421,comment,488369,488369,0,0,patio11,,,"Salaries are <i>very</i> dependent on what part of the world you're in, obviously.<p>Here in central Japan many companies have seen bonus cuts.  Typical compensation for a 20-something Japanese programmer might be:<p>$2,500 a month salary<p>+ $200 single's living allowance<p>+ $200 commute allowance<p>+ overtime<p>So call their base monthly pay $3,000, plus overtime.  Now twice a year they get a bonus, which is calculated as ""X months of your base monthly pay"", where X is determined by how well the company is doing.  In good times, that might be X = 2.5 or X = 3.  In leaner times, it can scale down or be eliminated.<p>If you assume that you earn 12 months pay from work and 5 months pay from bonuses, then a quick contraction in bonuses amounts to a substantial pay cut.<p>Bonuses at my company are down this year, by essentially rounding error, but some of my professional colleagues in the city have been cut all the way to zero.<p>These are not slouchy engineers, they just work for companies that supply a certain large automobile manufacturer, and that large automobile manufacturer has laid down the law: cut costs to us or find yourselves another large automobile manufacturer to give you 60% of your orders.",1235112518
488420,comment,488030,488054,0,0,jacquesm,,,"I think the main reason why we're seeing such a shift is that in the long run it is easier to ram advertising down people's throats over a video link than it is to get them to click on ads in textual content.

488418,comment,488135,488276,0,0,davidw,,,"> Compare this to Fedex and USPS where hundreds of random strangers cooperate to safely deliver very high value goods through bureaucratic hurdles like customs across countries reliably.<p>Having dealt with Fedex and UPS in Italy, I think I'd willing to take a chance with the Indian guys.  True story: my dad sent me my birth certificate via Fedex, and after a week it still hasn't arrived.  Finally, I get a call from Fedex, telling me it's been held in customs until I agree to pay the import duties.  ""Import duties, WTF?!"" was esentially my reaction. It turns out my dad had declared a value of $40 for the shipment, which was, in effect, the replacement value of the document if it had been lost.  After a bit of hemming and hawing, the Fedex guy admitted that the resale value of the birth certificate was zero and shouldn't be taxed, and it showed up a day or two later.  It bears repeating that I was not talking with an Italian customs official, but Fedex, who are supposed to, as you say, ""cooperate to deliver goods through bureaucratic hurdles"".",1235112347

I have no doubt that had there not been the massive public resentment they would have quickly iterated on it and made it into a very viable and interesting product.<p>The parent's post is quite correct. They could've spend months polishing beacon and it would've still been doomed to failure. Instead they put it out there and when it didn't get the desired response they canned it. If the comments system gets any traction whatsoever (and doesn't become a pr disaster like beacon was) I fully expect them to very quickly polish the product and make it very usable  for people that aren't the early adopters.",1235112127

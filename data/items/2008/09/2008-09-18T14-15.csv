In a free market, you could find folks who would work this job at that price.<p>Some of these folks have so few skills that they would still work this job.<p>Other of these folks have higher skills, and isntead of using them in some productive role (manager at a pharmacy, etc.), they're wasting their skills sitting on a stool making change.<p>If you think that it's a good thing for unskilled labor to be paid - because of union monopolization of labor - far far above it's productive level, then why not make the minimum wage $70k/yr for everyone?<p>Or better yet, $120k/yr ?",1221749727

When someone says the acceleration due to gravity of an object is always 100km/s^2 they are wrong and there is little point in giving them identical amounts of time.

For the record lots of politicians have been caught using personal email accounts for business and I think the same for all of them. The entire reason her email account was hacked was that she was caught using it for state business. If she hadn't skirted the law the email address wouldn't have been known and it wouldn't have been hacked. I do not know the politics of the hacker, but evading public scrutiny by using private email for public matters is not a political issue--it's wrong no matter the party.<p>The Washington Post has a piece about Palin's email policies, which include CCing her husband on state business:<p><a href=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/09/09/AR2008090903044.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/09...</a><p>Employees of major corporations would be fired for the same behavior (Sarbanes-Oxley has 'em all shit scared--destroying evidence like she did is major jail time).<p>Time agrees that using this un-archived email system is indeed a crime:<p><a href=""http://www.time.com/time/politics/article/0,8599,1842097,00.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.time.com/time/politics/article/0,8599,1842097,00....</a><p>> The Alaska Governor could also face charges for conducting official state business using her personal, unarchived e-mail account (a crime), with some critics accusing her of skirting freedom-of- information laws in doing so.",1221748763

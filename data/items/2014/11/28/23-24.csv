Figuring out for whom you are solving that particular problem and how your product will actually solve that problem is the hard part.<p>For every problem that there is to be solved, there are 1,000 ways to execute the product that is supposed to solve that problem.

It glorifies mindless ritual. It seems to believe that those who know best should be in charge (De Botton himself?) structuring life for others around them. It concentrates far too much on supposed motives (jealousy, envy, ambition, desire for respect, the desire to remake the world etc.) which may apply to the author, but are not necessarily as universal or basic as he seems to believe. Maybe, just maybe, on occasion, a person might buy a nice car not because they want to be seen in a nice car and thus respected, but simply because they like nice cars. Sometimes, a cigar is just a cigar.<p>To me, the individual is paramount. The society where the individual can expand is a beautiful and increasingly vanishing thing.

8672590,comment,8672200,8672200,0,0,graycat,,,"When I went to grad school, my career\nhad been programming, and I&#x27;d done a lot\nof it for some years.  Two applied math\nprofs were starting a computer science \ncourse and asked me what good lessons I&#x27;d\nlearned, and I answered.  The answer \nremains current:<p>A programmer stands between a real problem\nand a computer.<p>The computer does only\nwhat operations it is carefully instructed\nto do and no more understands the real problem\nthan the chef&#x27;s knife of a good cook \nunderstands cooking.<p>So, the work of the programmer is to take the real \nproblem and see how to use the computer to\nsolve it.<p>For this work, as a first step,\nif only to make the work easier\nfor the programmer, get a first list of the\ndata inputs for the problem and the data\noutputs.  Yes the code for a Web page is\na special case of this first step.<p>Then outline how the program will take the\ninputs and generate the outputs.<p>Here likely will need to define storage\nfor the inputs, say, some or all of\nvariables, arrays,\ndata structures, instances of object-oriented classes,\ndatabase tables, etc.<p>Then move on to the work manipulating\nthe input data to get the desired output\ndata.  In the case of a Web page or any\nsoftware with a graphical user interface\n(GUI), also will want to outline what the \noutput will look like on the user&#x27;s screen.<p>Then for the manipulations of the data,\nuse the old strategy of <i>divide and \nconquer</i>, that is, break the work down\ninto largely or entirely independent\npieces of work.  People have been doing\nwork of wide variety this way for\ncenturies, likely back to the pyramids\nand the first boats that could\ncross an ocean.\nFor each such piece,\nhave in the software a section of code,\nsubroutine, or function.  The work of such a piece\nmay be further subdivided.<p>In the end, want each such <i>piece</i> of\ncode, section, subroutine, ...,\nto be small, to have a purpose that is\neasy to explain briefly, that is \nfairly easy to debug, by <i>desk-checking</i>\n(that is, careful critical reading),\nrunning test cases, etc., and with logic\nthat is fairly easy to create, explain,\nand follow.<p>This division of the work should\nbe, at least intuitively, <i>robust</i>\nto small changes in the real world\nproblem to be solved.  That is,\nthe division should be for a problem\na little more general and complicated\nthan the one actually given; how much\nmore is a matter of judgment, but\na <i>small</i> change in the problem statement\nshould still be a <i>small</i> change\nin the software!<p>Next, in the division, exploit\nthe <i>scope of names</i> rules in the\nprogramming language to help\nthe software pieces be independent.<p>Next, remember that at least one\nhuman needs to be able to understand\nthe source code and that\n&quot;When a program is written, it is\nunderstood only by the programmer\nand God.  Six months later, only God.&quot;\nSo, humans need to be able to understand\nthe code, for small projects, just by\nreading the source code and not \nneeding additional documentation\noutside the source code.<p>Next, remember that humans communicate\nin natural languages, e.g., English,\nhopefully with sentences, paragraphs,\netc.  Remember that, no matter how much\nwe might wish and intend otherwise,\nthe source code of software is not\nin a natural language.  Yes we can\nuse mnemonic spelling for the various\nnames we choose and use, and such\nmnemonic naming does help someone trying\nto read and understand the code, but\nsuch mnemonic names are still a long\nway from English.  Bluntly, as\n<i>information</i> for a human reader, the\ncode doesn&#x27;t really mean anything or\nis likely a puzzle problem to solve\nto guess the <i>meaning</i>.<p>So, net, have to document the code,\nthat is, explain the code to\na human, explain with English, \nessentially with sentences, \nparagraphs, etc.<p>Here is an example of a technique\nin source code documentation:\nMy project now is a new Web site;\nthe source code for the Web pages is\nin Microsoft&#x27;s Visual Basic .NET\nmaking use of the .NET Framework\n(collection of object-oriented class),\nSQL Server,\nASP.NET, and IIS.  For this work, I have\n5000+ Web pages of documentation, nearly\nall from Microsoft&#x27;s Web site MSDN.<p>So, my code makes use of a lot of\nclasses, functions, etc. from \nthose 5000+ pages of documentation,\nand some of those classes, etc. do\na lot and need some good documentation.\nSo, in my source code, when I use\none of those classes, functions, etc.,\nI insert in my source code a comment\nwith the title of an appropriate \nWeb page of documentation along with\na tree name of the Web page on\na hard disk on my computer.  So, when\nreading such source code, one keystroke\nin my favorite text editor\n(which is what I use to write code)\nwill display the Web page so that\nI can confirm that my source code\nis doing what I intend.<p>Since the\ncode is awash in <i>symbols</i>,\ngood examples of how to\nexplain code are in good texts\nin subjects based heavily on\nsymbols.  So, can explain code\nmuch like a good freshman physics\ntext explains Newton&#x27;s second \nlaw or Coulomb&#x27;s law or how\na good freshman calculus text\nexplains conic sections or\ndifferentiation.  E.g., for\nEnglish readers, mathematics is\nstill written in English;\nthen the symbols are names,\nthat is nouns.<p>In large projects, the \ndocumentation may be \nhundreds of pages.\nBut essentially always there\nis documentation as source\ncode comments in the source code.<p>Then, six months later God, the\nprogrammer, and others will all\nbe able to understand the code!<p>My view is that currently the biggest\nbottleneck in practical computing\nis poor documentation.  Sorry &#x27;bout\nthat.  YMMV!",1417218971

What local businesses do you spend you time and money in? Groceries and gas? Both are probably not locally owned, so most of what you spend leaves the area. You drive 2 hours on weekends to get to the nearest Walmart to buy clothes, so again most of your money leaves the area: and none of the places you&#x27;re spending at employee lots of people and/or pay them lots of money. Most of the jobs servicing those industries will be part-time anyways.<p>For the people who work in the mines, they make more money, but they honestly don&#x27;t really know what to do with it...and there&#x27;s nothing in particular to spend it on locally anyway.<p>Even worse, arable land is a rarity, it is a mountain area! So it&#x27;s hard to even build a local agricultural economy. It&#x27;s isolated from transport links, landlocked and hard to navigate. If you pick a route from anywhere East of Appalachia, and take it to San Francisco or L.A., you&#x27;ll be routed entirely around the area in favor of a Northern or Southern route.<p>I didn&#x27;t grow up in Appalachia, but I grew up in an area not too different from it. Honestly, if we hadn&#x27;t been within commuting distance of a major city, my career options would have been farm work or gas station attendant. There wasn&#x27;t even enough of a commercial sector for &quot;retail clerk&quot; to make the list.<p>It&#x27;s a useful thing to drive through that area: it&#x27;s stunningly beautiful, but you start to get a feel for why there&#x27;s so little going on there.",1417218905

So it&#x27;s not as simple as it seems, which is why there&#x27;s dozens of huge billion-dollar companies who do this such as Costco, Sysco, US Foods, Shamrocks, etc. You just shop around and stay on top of food costs. And if you&#x27;re a medium-large chain you lock down trade agreements much farther up the supply chain (producer level) to very low fixed prices for 6 months at a time.

Nice straw man.<p>He/She said &quot;many in this area continue to shun higher education in favor of strict adherence to the bible.&quot; But, since you are asking the question, lets look at an answer:<p>- How about all of the passages justifying rape/slavery/violence in the Old Testament? All of these, while not outright shunning higher education, do so implicitly. Just one example among many:<p>&quot;However, you may purchase male or female slaves from among the foreigners who live among you.  You may also purchase the children of such resident foreigners, including those who have been born in your land.  You may treat them as your property, passing them on to your children as a permanent inheritance.  You may treat your slaves like this, but the people of Israel, your relatives, must never be treated this way.&quot;  (Leviticus 25:44-46 NLT)<p>Something else to look at - &quot;Anti-intellectualism in American Life&quot; (Richard Hofstadter).

What launched me into development when I didn&#x27;t even know to program (so one step behind you) was that I found a problem I had personally had and looked for a way that could solved it. It turned out it was programming. The reason this was so effective was I was already passionate about the problem before I even knew what programming was. Then I discovered programming was the right approach, so I learned the tools to get the job done, then iterated.<p>That _passion_ was a HUGE motivator, in fact i didn&#x27;t even like programming really was when I solved the problem, but I liked the result. I realized later how many problems could be solved that programming was the tool for the job so I eventually learned to program. But that came after I found the problems I was passionate about.<p>I find later that this approach was very fulfilling and now I am reading heavy textbooks and doing jobs I thought I would NEVER do because I really like solving problems. But I never could have seen myself doing this 10 years ago.<p>Now you&#x27;re follow up question might be, how do I find my passion for this tool I have. Doesn&#x27;t that now feel like an awkward question? I have a tool, I don&#x27;t know why I have it, but I want to use it on something. There must have been some reason why you learned how to use this tool. What made you say &quot;wow, how was this done?&quot;, or &quot;I wish I could just do X&quot; Try to recreate whatever it was that made you first look up &quot;how to learn javascript programming&quot; in google. If you are still stuck, then you might take to some of these other answers. Browse github, visualize something that could exist and work backwards, read other peoples code etc... but where all of them will fall short and where I suggest you take with yourself is that nothing will kick you on the curb harder then doing something that you&#x27;re not passionate about.<p>The number of times I quit a program half way through because I lost the passion was A LOT! I felt miserable about programming for years. I thought I didn&#x27;t have what it takes and beat myself up about it a lot. I was admittedly ambitious. Some things that could have helped:<p>* Smaller problems. Something you may not be able to control.<p>* Breaking your goals up into smaller chunks so you get rewards often.<p>* Working with someone else. Think of it like a running buddy, or a workout buddy.<p>* Being forced to do it. Get a job in programming, if someone realizes on you, and you feel that heat under your butt you&#x27;ll probably end up doing it even if you loose the passion temporarily, though you should stop if you never get the passion back, but give it some time.<p>* Teach someone. You learn very quickly if you try to teach someone else. Especially if you try to force your brain to think of ways to find your passion. It&#x27;s a good chance it will spark some passion into yourself as well.<p>Good luck, I hope something I said helped spark something in you and I hope you can find your passion! Or learn that this passion isn&#x27;t for you. Someone once said that programming is 90% frustration and 10% elation. That gets you through that 90% my argument here is your passion to solve the issue. If you have no passion that 90% is going to be hell. But stick with it because it will take time!

When I learned my first programming language, I decided to create my own CMS. I was still in high school, around 15-16 years old so it was just a fun project for me.<p>Imagine a simple version of a Wordpress. An admin area where you can add new posts and tag them. And an index page where the posts are displayed in a descending order with a pagination.<p>This will teach you basic ideas about how to store data in a database, how to work with forms etc, how to retrieve the data from the database and display them in a structured way (templates).<p>Ok, let&#x27;s make it little bit more challenging. users can click on individual posts and add comments. Once I got my hands dirty and created something simple, I started adding more functionality to satisfy my newly acquired thirst for knowledge.<p>Each new problem I solved, no matter how trivial, motivated me to go t a next level and learn more.<p>Let&#x27;s say users have to register in order to post comments. This will learn you how to create a basic authentication system, how sessions and cookies work, how to safely store passwords in the database, maybe add your own custom catcha element on top of it.<p>Next, I moved on to a new feature. I wanted to be able to upload pictures from the admin area and be able to insert them inside posts. Images should also be resized into multiple sizes (thumbnail, full size etc).<p>You can see that what started as a very simple project can actually grow more and more complex and you can learn a lot.<p>After I finished my CMS, I went on to a new project, I wanted to created my own text editor and a simple image editor (imagine MS Paint). Did both of those and again learned a lot.<p>After that, I went even deeper and created a fairly complex social network from scratch. Although this was the first piece of code in my life I got actually paid for so it probably doesn&#x27;t count.<p>What I am trying to say is that you should go and get your hands dirty. It might seem like reinventing the wheel (because it is reinventing the wheel) but it is perfect for learning how to actually do something useful with code.

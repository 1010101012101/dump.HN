The smaller the business, the more efficient.&quot;<p>I didn&#x27;t say that; no need for the sarcasm.<p>The answer is somewhat complicated. Small businesses have an advantage because the information flow between directly involved parties and decision makers is very short; possibly the same person. They can notice an inefficiency and correct it immediately, rather than needing some kind of permission or authorization (which is inherently a slow way for information to travel because it involves other people). They can also seize opportunities quickly for the same reason (which may involve changing prices or making a non-traditional deal).<p>Large businesses can get economies of scale, although I think these are dramatically over-emphasized. Producing one marginal unit may be cheaper up to a point, but eventually the next marginal unit becomes more costly than the last (because there becomes so much demand for the inputs that it increases the price). That&#x27;s the nature of the supply curve. Often, businesses that deal in huge volumes and have great economies of scale are medium-sized or even small. Of course, there are some industries where economies of scale are crucial and only large businesses or governments can really operate efficiently.<p>Large businesses have greater political influence and more ability to work in a regulated/political/government environment. This is perhaps their greatest advantage.<p>I&#x27;d be interested to see the numbers you have about the share of the economy powered by small/medium businesses.

Then they raised the price if the next day happened to be Saturday.  Now, next-day shipping varies depending on the item and is often unavailable.  It&#x27;s never <i>less</i> than $3.99, though.  2-day shipping is rarely shipped via a 2-day shipping service; often they drop it in the mail and hope for the best.  (Also, why even bother charging me $4?  Just make next-day shipping free and charge $4 more for the thing.)<p>* Various unreliable courier services end up doing a good chunk of the deliveries.  UPS, Fedex, and the USPS are great.  I don&#x27;t know how they do it, but they manage to break into my apartment building every day of the week and drop off packages without me ever knowing the details.  Lasership and A1?  Yeah right.  I love it when they try to deliver packages to my office at 10PM.  Are any office mail rooms open at 10PM ever?  Ever?  Nice try.  (Does Amazon even use A1 anymore?  I remember finding a bug in A1&#x27;s website that disclosed the name and address of all their customers.  Emailed security@amazon and security@a1.  Heard back from Amazon that they fixed it.  Never saw another package from A1.  Maybe A1 just rebranded as Lasership.  I really have no idea.)<p>* Add-on items.  Need I say more?<p>* Every time you order something from Amazon, you get a stupid interstitial about how you can opt-in to receive email about streaming a bunch of B movies and flopped TV shows at 160i resolution via your Flash player.  No thanks, Amazon.  You&#x27;re a physical media store, not Netflix!

Still though, lets take just one aspect, db interaction for which I used hibernate:<p>First I create my DB structure, then create an XML mapping, then create the POJO model (replete with getters/setters) sure, most IDEs do this automagically, but experience with switching IDEs and changing versions makes me abhore IDE generated code, then hibernate&#x27;s own XML config, then the utility class (I called these factories, my bad). Not to mention the prerequisites that made all this possible, glassfish, maven etc require their own configuration etc. By now I have several thousand lines of code and I&#x27;ve not even implemented any functionality. Time taken, no clue, but hours, lots of hours.<p>The equivalent with Python + TornDb?<p>Create schema, extend torndb to pull credentials from environment variables & connect to db (3 lines of code, wow), create flaskapp.py, bind path to a method, begin writing the &quot;real&quot; code. Lines of source, under 100. Time taken, less than an hour.<p>> J2EE (which became Java EE over 8 years ago) I have to wonder if you used a lot of legacy APIs and design patterns.<p>When you spend a considerable amount of time calling something by one name, despite a rename you tend to continue.

You&#x27;d be better off using serialised objects, CSV files, heck even notes scribbed on postit notes tacked to the wall than JavaDB.<p>I say this after countless hours spent taking the platform offline to rebuild the database which grew uncontrollably despite careful use of transactions within hibernate and daily cron jobs to run SYSCS_UTIL.SYSCS_COMPRESS_TABLE",1394726876

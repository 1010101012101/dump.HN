If you (the programmer) know that consistently correct prediction is impossible (as it is often is for binary search) then it&#x27;s often beneficial to convince the compiler to generate conditional moves rather than branches.  This is what the article shows for the test results.<p>Conditional moves (CMP/CMOVcc) will always be slower than correctly predicted branches (CMP/JMPcc) if the branch is predicted correctly.  If the prediction accuracy if 50%, the conditional move will always be faster.   The threshold for prediction accuracy differs for different processors, but 85% is a reasonable approximation. This necessary threshold is moving higher with modern processors (CMOV is getting relatively faster).",1414346158

But then my advisor tried to open one of my documents on his machine (Windows, I&#x27;m using a Mac) and some kind of weird error came up.  So we spent one whole advising session with him searching for MiKTeX and installing it, whereupon my document still wouldn&#x27;t load for whatever reason.<p>Then once BibTeX got in the mix, it became even messier.  Well, I finally finished the article and submitted it to a journal, but they had so many requirements for LaTeX submissions that it took a while to change everything for it.  Once I finally submitted it -- surprise! -- their online LaTeX compiler came back with another weird error.  It took me about 8 more submission attempts to isolate the &quot;bug&quot; (which was some kind of issue due to differences in versions and default packages installed on their machine vs mine), and I finally got a PDF generated.  Except it still didn&#x27;t look the same as mine for whatever reason.<p>Well, the article got rejected from that journal, and so as I&#x27;m applying for another journal, I read &quot;Word documents only&quot;.<p>So I gave up on LaTeX.  Too much of a hassle for me.  Maybe it&#x27;s a smooth process for everyone else, but I don&#x27;t have any problems just typing a Word document and sending it off.

Are they so central to your industry that they can immediately lock up 100% of the market?  Are they going to be cross-selling from something which is more widely distributed in your niche than say Quickbooks or Microsoft Office?<p>Don&#x27;t compete on price.  Enterprise customers care about it a lot less than you do, and enterprise customers are not motivated to purchase by &quot;We saved a few thousand bucks and I lost my job because the deployment blew up in our face.&quot;  I&#x27;d be far more worried about that sales objection than the existence of a competitor.<p>You can probably compete on many other axes.  One of my competitors has 400 employees, at least 20 of whom answer phones with customer questions.  I have 0 employees, intentionally don&#x27;t have a routable phone number, and self-assess at mediocre in terms of responsiveness to email.  And I win sales dogfights with that company, occasionally, because prospects believe I&#x27;ll offer them better CS.  (The winning argument, which I&#x27;ve stolen fragrantly from Jason Cohen, is &quot;You can call them up at any hour, day or night, and instantly speak to someone who can&#x27;t solve your problem.  Or you can drop me an email, and it may take me two days to get to it, but your email will always be answered by the guy who built the system with his own hands.  Your call who you want in charge of your questions when it is your business on the line.&quot;)<p>There are other options, such as competing on market segmentation.  Your competitor, for example, might serve primarily a healthcare market.  If the same need exists outside of healthcare, you can target your marketing/development over there, and make a product which really sings for those other audiences.  Is their product generic?  Make yours hyper-specific.  Is their product hyper-customized?  Make yours the &quot;It only does 10% of what the other guy does, but it is the right 10%, <i>and</i> it actually works out of the box.&quot;<p>How do they market/sell it?  Is it one of those &quot;Ask for a quote and we&#x27;ll let you speak to a sales rep?&quot; type of deals.  Consider selling via a lower-touch sales model.  Worse comes to worse, you learn why high-touch sales is so darn popular.<p>Also, to impart on you as early as possible the Voice of Pained SaaS Founder Experience: pause building for a moment and verify that you can successfully sell this.  If necessary, you can have mockups or a minimally functional prototype to support the sales conversation.  There are many worthwhile SaaS products which cannot be sold by a single founder into particular enterprises, so knowing whether your product is saleable or not given your constraints is a useful sanity check on whether to spend the rest of the schedule building it out.<p>Selling SaaS which doesn&#x27;t exist is fairly straightforward.  Find a customer.  Ask them to buy it.  Note why they tell you &quot;No.&quot;  Adjust until you have gotten a &quot;Yes.&quot;  Now, repeat at least 5 times.  Then, finish building it.<p>If you cannot find a customer, or you can find the customer but can&#x27;t get the right decisionmaker internally to get the time of day, or your customer doesn&#x27;t consider this a hair-on-fire priority, or your current conception of the product doesn&#x27;t match things they budget for, or any of a thousand other things systematically happen to block sales, then building the software does not in itself cure those sales problems.<p>Incidentally, the number of enterprise deals which you have to close to have a very good living as a solo founder is somewhere between one and twenty.  Their billion dollar valuation might be sustained by a team of stab-their-own-mother-for-a-commission-check reps being fed the Glengarry leads from the best marketing operation in enterprise software, but even they don&#x27;t win <i>every</i> deal.

Because a DVI file\nis essentially just text, or, as I outlined, it\nspecifies put this character at these coordinates on the\npage, put that character there on the page,\ngo to a new page, etc.<p>To be more clear, say, about the file reading-writing,\nthat happens when the TeX program reads the user&#x27;s\nTeX input and before the DVI file is generated.\nGiven only the DVI file and displaying it,\nthere is no file reading-writing.<p>So, it looks like could convert TeX DVI output to HTML.<p>You pointed out that maybe HTML with a browser has\nmore flexibility than TeX output.  Okay, maybe.  But\nI didn&#x27;t claim that, given an HTML file, there would\nbe a TeX input file and a corresponding TeX DVI output\nfile that my envisioned converter would convert to\nthe given HTML file.  Instead, I just claimed that\nfor a given TeX and DVI file, the converter would\ngenerate an HTML file.<p>Or the converter would\nbe a function from the set \nof all TeX DVI files to the set of all HTML files.\nThat is, for each TeX DVI file there would be\na corresponding HTML file from the converter.\nBut the function would not be <i>onto</i> the\nset of HTML files, that is, not all HTML\nfiles would be a value of the converter;\nnot all HTML files could be obtained\nby using TeX input, the TeX program,\nthe DVI file and the envisioned converter.<p>You also mentioned some ways in which \nHTML, say, with <div>, is more <i>flexible</i>\nthan TeX.  Fine.  But I was discussing\njust converting TeX DVI to HTML.<p>And, again, I see no way to convert TeX\ninput, which is a programming language,\nto HTML, which is not a programming language.<p>Whew!<p>More clear now?",1414344238

Parsing HTML (which probably doesn&#x27;t validate) is hard. Extracting semantic meaning from parsed HTML is hard.<p>Even once you&#x27;ve piled on the libraries and extracted the bit of information that you need, what do you do with that data? You process it a bit and store it in some kind of data structure. But at this point, you&#x27;ve could have just pinged the website&#x27;s API and gotten the same data (and more) in a data structure.<p>It turns out it&#x27;s a heck of a lot easier to return a blob of JSON than it is to process text in markup on a page. And smaller, as well: JSON often takes up far less space than the corresponding markup for the same content. That&#x27;s a big deal when you&#x27;re processing a very large amount of information.<p>There&#x27;s the promise that AI will someday make this easier: if you eliminate the parse-and-process-into-a-data-structure step and just assume that an AI will do that part for you, you&#x27;re in good shape. But that&#x27;s nowhere near being a practical reality for virtually all developers, and APIs eliminate this step for you.<p>Even if you use something like HTML microdata, there&#x27;s very few consumers of the data. Some browsers give you access to it, but that doesn&#x27;t make it extremely useful: if you generated the data on the server side, why not just make it into a useful interface? Or expose the data as raw data to begin with? Going through the extra effort to use these APIs is a redundant step for most use cases.",1414343709

This solves some fundamental issues that you and Cory Doctorow mentioned:<p>1) The economics equation for tagging now works out. The user that&#x27;s doing the tagging has an immediate need (and payoff) for doing that tagging.<p>A corollary of this is that the parts of the web that are most valuable (in the sense that users need them the most) tend to get tagged first.<p>The following are responses to Cory&#x27;s essay:<p>2.1) The person that&#x27;s doing the tagging is also an end user, so there&#x27;s an incentive to do the tagging honestly. That doesn&#x27;t stop the underlying website from lying. But that&#x27;s an issue with the web in general, and is mitigated by things like SEO penalties, reviews, etc.<p>2.2) Again, the tagger is the person who benefits from the tagging, so as long as the data is valuable enough, it will be tagged despite laze.<p>2.3) We haven&#x27;t overcome human stupidity. Presumably since the person tagging the data needs it, it will be at a &quot;good enough&quot; level to be usable.<p>2.4) This one doesn&#x27;t apply; the tagger is a different person.<p>2.5) 2.6) and 2.7) These are tougher, and we haven&#x27;t started working on them yet.

The spec even tells you not to implement them (and Microsoft does not implement them). They are there for third parties who reverse engineered ancient Word and WordPerfect formats and built tool chains around them, and want to move to a newer format but need to mark places where they depend on quirks of those ancient programs.<p>Here&#x27;s the use case this is aimed at. Suppose I run, say, a law office, and we&#x27;ve got an internal document management system that does things like index and cross reference documents, manage citation lists, and stuff like that. The workflow is based on WordPerfect format (WordPerfect was for a long time the de facto standard for lawyers).<p>Now suppose I want to start moving to a newer format for storage. Say I pick ODF, and start using that for new documents, and make my tools understand it. I&#x27;d like to convert my existing WordPerfect documents to ODF. However, there are things in WordPerfect that cannot be reproduced exactly in ODF, and this is a problem. If my tools need to figure out what page something is on, in order to generate a proper citation to that thing, and I&#x27;ve lost some formatting information converting to ODF, I may not get the right cite.<p>So what am I going to do? I&#x27;m going to add some extra, proprietary markup of my own to ODF that lets me include my reverse engineered WordPerfect knowledge when I convert my old documents to ODF, and my new tools will be modified to understand this. Now my ODF workflow can generate correct cites for old documents. Note that LibreOffice won&#x27;t understand my additional markup, and will presumably lose it if I edit a document, but that&#x27;s OK. The old documents I converted should be read-only.<p>Of course, I&#x27;m not the only person doing this. Suppose you also run a law office, with a WordPerfect work flow, and are converting to an ODF work flow. You are likely going to add some proprietary markup, just like I did. We&#x27;ll both end up embedding the same WordPerfect information in our converted legacy documents, but we&#x27;ll probably pick different markup for it. It would be nice if we could get together, make a list of things we&#x27;ve reverse engineered, and agree to use the same markup when embedding that stuff in ODF.<p>And that&#x27;s essentially what they did in OOXML. They realized there would be people like us with our law offices, who have reverse engineered legacy data, that will be extending the markup. So they made a list of a bunch of things from assorted past proprietary programs that were likely to have been reverse engineered by various third parties, and reserved some markup for each.",1414343236

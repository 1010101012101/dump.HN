3467884,comment,3467585,3467717,11,0,oblique63,,,"I too just started reading this one.<p>For me, my first foray into 'low-level' programming was during my freshman year in a CS101 course that used C++. That first course on it's own wasn't too bad, but the subsequent 'introductory' courses for more C++ and Data Structures + Algorithms were just terrible. I couldn't absorb anything useful from them because I was just overwhelmed with the constant bombardment of Segmentation Faults everywhere. Poor teachers + high learning overhead as a result of using a low-level language, just made me want to stray as far away as possible from ever using a 'C-langage' again. If it wasn't for me discovering Python around the same time, I probably would've just given up and pursued music or audio engineering instead.<p>Fast forward to last year, having now learned a ton more languages, I decided to go back and start reading K&R. I didn't manage to get through a whole lot, but from what I read, I liked it. The problem was that I didn't really feel motivated to keep plowing through it. Looking through the snippets of code in it, more and more I began wondering if some things were just outdated practices, or if they were in fact crazy idioms that I would have to get used to when dealing with C. That doubt (as silly as it might sound) did put me off a bit. The explanations in the text were top notch, but again, the code just didn't compel me to type it in like I knew I should.<p>Now I started reading LCTHW just a few days ago, and I have to say, it is quite awesome. It's a lot more minimal and sparse than I'm used to for a book, but I have been seriously surprised at how effective that method is. At first I was a bit annoyed that a lot of parts were basically saying 'just google it', cause I look to books to present me with a more coherent explanation of things than I can find scattered around the web or in arcane documentation. But as I went on with it, I noticed that the things he makes you look up on your own are generally specific enough that it makes the task of filtering out all the nonsense much easier than if you were researching it on your own. I quickly got into the groove of the book, because it just builds your confidence that you can be pretty self-sufficient in a new environment, even at the early stages of your learning. Combine that with his 'code first, explain later' format, and that book is surprisingly motivating. In just 2 days, I went through the first 17 chapters (currently stuck on the extra credit for the Database exercise), and I just want to keep on going. I think this is the first time I've ever experienced this level of enjoyment and drive from a programming tutorial. I have no idea why this is, but it's damn impressive. I can't wait to get to the K&R portion at the end.<p>Thanks Zed!",1326653817

Who owns the biggest mansions? Microsoft executives, members of the Nordstrom family, members of the construction family who built the Space Needle, people connected with Daniel's Broiler, some guy who invented a new kind of eyeglasses, a congressman's ex-wife, a woman who grew and sold her IT consulting firm, a guy who built a successful condo listing website, doctors, the founder of an investment firm, a commercial real estate developer...

3467848,comment,3466925,3467283,18,0,Dn_Ab,,,"I strongly disagree with you but was planning on staying out of this conversation. But now I feel compelled to interject.<p>Your example fails in supporting your point. Your example person could not be more different from Arfa.<p>Your character: Fat Boy who enjoys messing with .NET is alive and enjoying his snickers bar.<p>Arfa: Young Intelligent, Motivated Girl Concretely acting in fulfilling her goals and bettering her environment dies at 16.<p>It does not matter her gender, age or privilege. Her outlook, her willingness to act in perusing her goals and enrichment - in spite of her ""silver spoon"" - puts her ahead of a lot of people. Do not underestimate the power of taking things for granted.<p>We agree that her early death is tragic. But is it fair that so many other people also die and no one notices? No it is not fair. I agree. But the reality of the matter is that attention is a scarce resource and will always be. Now, If I had somehow heard about the death of your rich fat kid from NYC then I would certainly feel empathy for the parents and the early loss. But the reality is, a random person hearing of that event is not a likely scenario. Most news outlets would not be interested.<p>Many people, some more technically accomplished than Arfa will not get similar coverage. But technical accomplishment is not the sole determinant of value as a person or worth in attention units. If you look at how we price people's worth in attention you will notice that it is only loosely correlated with the value of the labor they put into improving themselves and more correlated with how much demand for their attention they can create.<p>As for Arfa's case she actually does stands up to scrutiny of the worth of her accomplishments. The real loss is not her current skill but the time derivative of it, the rate of increase, her potential. The fact that she had already made news, met Bill Gates, lack of greed, willingness to give back and the inspirational aspect of it all. Those add to make hers a very uncommon situation and hence worth covering by the media.<p>Her dying is a very sad event as is the case for nearly all deaths. But make no mistake, this coverage is not due to the empathy of the news outlets but a calculated cost value decision. Fair or not that is the reality of it and there is no gain in focusing on how many others are not covered instead giving more weight to the tragic fact of her loss.  She has gotten to your ellipsoid of attention. That alone justifies the attention she is receiving, not an accounting of how easy it is to replicate her accomplishments. Such a stance is not much difference from holding a belief that I could make stackoverflow in a week.<p>Finally I completely disagree that empathy drains perspective. Empathy gives perspective. You underestimate the value of social and emotional intelligence, which are vital in getting people to work together and overcome difficulties. Empathy is exactly trying to get someone's perspective and then using that to your mutual advantages (or manipulate to get ahead). Intelligence in species is correlated with complexity of social groups. Some argue Neanderthals were more IQ intelligent than us - closer to our savants but we overcame them by being more able to work together and having a superior Collective Intelligence.<p>Empathy is not an enemy of rationality. See Higher order intentionality. I have a pet theory that the empathetic mind is a simulation based intelligence, dual to the calculation based intelligence commonly linked to I.Q. You can run simulations, or run outright calculations to get at the same answer. Some things are easier to calculate others easier to simulate. Both add perspective and neither has ordinality.",1326653186

""The Congress shall have power to promote the Progress of Science and useful Arts, by securing for limited Times to Authors and Inventors the exclusive Right to their respective Writings and Discoveries;""<p>They have the power to ""promote progress"" and not the power to ""enable rent-seeking"", which is basically what intellectual property laws have been perverted into by private individuals seeking to increase their short term gains.<p>US Intellectual Property Law is a prime example of the tragedy of the commons.<p>Which would you rather have? Under which situation would you and 99% of all U.S. Citizens be better off: (1) the right to the exclusive income on something you have made for your entire life and part of the life of your heirs and assigns or (2) the right to free, unfettered access to every intellectual good created prior to 2004 that isn't a trade secret?<p>Under which of those two scenarios would more ""progress in Science and the useful Arts"" occur?<p>I don't know about you, but when I have kids, I would prefer that they inherit a large commons than rights to income from the works I have created.<p>P.S. To directly answer your question. What I believe about that doesn't matter. What does matter is that the laws in this country be enacted with the <i></i><i>sole</i><i></i> purpose of maximizing Science and the useful Arts that we all have free and open access to. If it is necessary to permit someone to temporarily restrict access to an intellectual good to provide financial incentive to a creator to create a work in the first place then that achieves the goals of the U.S. Constitution. How much restriction and for how long, should be the <i></i><i>absolute minimum</i><i></i> necessary to make sure the innovation happens at all.<p>99.9+% of all rational actors would not going to be dissuaded from creating by a copyright policy that only lasts the original 7 years. Every time copyright has been extended, it has been extended by people who have already profited handsomely off their intellectual good to the prior X years (where X is the copyright term at the time) and would like to extend that term so they can continue to earn rent. The terms would probably never have been extended otherwise, since the lawyers and lobbyists necessary to argue for the copyright extension in Congress don't come cheap.<p>There is nothing preventing people from selling their goods with DRM. The problem with DRM is that it makes a good less convenient for a buyer and drives the buyer to other goods or illegitimate copies.

There is an art to hyperbole, and as much as it makes us all cringe, we need to start engaging in it and framing the argument in a way that will get the visceral juices flowing a bit.  ""This bill will cause Facebook to delete your account and any of your friends if you post a video"", ""This bill will force youtube to delete all the videos you took at your childs birthday party"", etc. You lose the argument when you accept a compromise when starting from the position you want to finish in.

However after a week of trying it became painfully clear that Disqus was only designed for one use case in mind: a single comment box per page, e.g. blogs. Comment topics in Disqus are tied to the URL, which doesn't work in my case because I want each section on the same page to have a different comment topic. The Disqus developer documentation says that they support AJAX but I did things exactly as documented and all I got was vague undebuggable JavaScript errors.<p>IntenseDebate was the almost exactly same. I gave up after two days.<p>I finished the most important parts of Juvia today. I got Juvia commenting in the manual working in about 15 minutes.",1326651541

Lots of data in an easy-to-explore format.<p>Having said that, I'm not sure if the colors were important enough to merit being included. Do I really care that some occupation gives people a better chance of being in the 1%? Probably not. I'd rather see how many total dollars we are talking about. For instance, do the 1% working securities law make a bunch more than the 1% who are construction managers? By how much?<p>I'll attempt a tl;dr, although you really should read the article. The 1% consists mostly of: managers, physicians, and lawyers, maybe with elementary and middle-school administrators thrown in as well.<p>I would caution to be careful of drawing too many conclusions, however. Every time we have these discussions it's the little details that always get you. It's very easy to feel like you are learning more than you actually are. Always be suspicious of aggregated data, especially when you are looking for insight. I blogged about this last month. (<a href=""http://www.whattofix.com/blog/archives/2011/12/management-by-s.php"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.whattofix.com/blog/archives/2011/12/management-by...</a>)<p>Guys like lawyers and school principals fit into nice, little boxes. Entrepreneurs don't.  I run into this every time I fill out a government form. For instance I know a guy locally who runs a couple of convenience stores, sells fuel on the side (by ""on the side"" I mean hundreds of thousands of gallons or more a month through home heating oil trucks, propane, etc.) , has a go-cart track, and is getting into e-commerce. What do you call him? A fuel speculator? Grocery manager? Entertainer? We talk about this all the time on HN, even though we don't know it. Take your average startup, say Stripe, are they a technology company? We would probably say so, but they also look a lot like a financial services company. How about the guy who's a lawyer and helps startups in a participatory manner for equity. Is he a VC? A lawyer manager? A partner? Yes, I know the IRS has legal definitions, but when looking at data like this the legal definitions don't really fit the discussion -- it just leaves us more questions than we started with.<p>The category of many of these business alone is problematic, much less trying to figure out job titles. Real innovation happens between the cracks. It doesn't fit into nice little boxes. The economy works because people are free to pick and choose little bits of all kinds of things to refashion them into something new that never existed before, so the parts that aren't being tracked here are the most important. Once you start looking at aggregates, averages, and deviations, you can make numbers say about anything you want.",1326651194

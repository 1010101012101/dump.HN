What's the security level on subways?  In Boston and NY, it's a bunch of signs saying ""if you see something, say something"" and ""we reserve the right in principle to search your bags (penalty for refusal: leaving the subway)"".<p>Intercity trains are sometimes suggested to be terrorist targets (I'm not sure whether they are).  What's the security level on Amtrak?  Well, I've seen K9 teams at Penn station.  I've noticed that K9 teams are a damn sight less intrusive than airport security (and K9 dogs are a damn sight cuter than X-rays).",1309532369

Someone could have two rooms & a car that breaks down often, but no A/C. Someone could have all 3 and someone else could have 0. Also the AHS mentions that 11% of those below poverty don't have safe drinking water & 20% live in a neighborhood with serious crime.<p>Also rooms per person & A/C & a car may not illustrate quality of life.

2718407,comment,2717697,2718242,1,0,fexl,,,"OK, I'll discuss what's different and leave ""better"" out of it.<p>1. In Fexl, there is no distinction between data and function.  All data structures such as lists, pairs, etc. are represented as functions.<p>2. Fexl has a small grammar, about as small as I think is feasible for expressing arbitrary functions.  You could actually omit these rules:<p><pre><code>  exp => \\ sym = term exp\n  exp => \\ sym == term exp\n  exp => ; exp\n</code></pre>\nBut the resulting forms would be far more difficult to write and understand.<p>3. Fexl has a very simple compilation and evaluation strategy, reducing everything to combinatorial forms.  There are no ""environments"" or ""closures"" or ""contexts"" being whipped around at run-time.  The resulting Fexl executable program is about 35K in size.<p>4. Unlike other functional programming languages, Fexl does not rely on ""pattern matching"" for branching on the different possible forms of a piece of data.  Instead, it simply <i>calls</i> that piece of data as a function, passing in the appropriate handlers for the various cases.  For example, using excessively verbose function names here:<p><pre><code>  list\n      handle_empty_list\n      \\head\\tail handle_first_item head; handle_remainder tail\n</code></pre>\n5. Fexl doesn't really have a distinct concept for defining a name -- that's all handled normally by lambda calculus.  However it does provide the syntactic shorthand ""="".  For example this function:<p><pre><code>  \\square = (\\x mul x x)\n  print (square 4)\n</code></pre>\nIs equivalent to this function, which does not use the ""="":<p><pre><code>  (\\square print (square 4)) (\\x mul x x)\n</code></pre>\nI'm not exactly sure if that's oh-so-different from other programming languages, but I'll venture a guess that many of those other languages use a symbol table to store function definitions at run-time, while Fexl does not.<p>6. Fexl never creates circular data structures in memory.  Now because of lazy evaluation, you can create logically circular or infinite structures in Fexl, but these are always closed forms and never involve literal circularity in memory.  Consequently it is possible to manage memory using reference counting -- and Fexl does that.  Some may not like that, but it's simple and it gets the job done.  The code even has a built-in assertion to ensure that all memory was properly reclaimed at the end of a run.<p>(I'm not <i>certain</i> that other languages create circular structures in memory, but I am certain that Fexl does not so I thought it worth mentioning.)",1309529752

A traditionally long standing business (good ole boys) type of company. A financial or insurance institution, with hundreds of employees in I.T., devs, QA, and deployment.<p>I've seen big corps with large teams who are entrenched in .Net or Java mention they also must worry about getting people to understand your Scala code. Hate to say it, but I've meet a lot of supposed Java programmers who didn't know what a HashMap was... in big corp...<p>In my experience, they just (big corp) don't give a crap. It's Java or .Net and if you don't like it... leave.<p>Unless that one small group going rouge and using Scala has full backing from the top you'll find yourself on a deserted island in time... which doesn't mean to say that they won't give you a shot. They will but they want 2-3x results. Otherwise why break what you have now? I'm just saying that is what I see them thinking.<p>I believe it has to do more with the type of project and if it has real visible impact on the bottom line to whether Scala or X,Y,Z will succeed in the big corp env. Project A does well, makes Big Corp more $$$ then they try to reproduce. Mr. VP of finance doesn't care if it's Scala or Alacs (Scala backwards) and that Scala helps you write less code. Small Corp might though as they have less resources (funds/time).<p>Just my opinion from interfacing with Big Corp.<p>I did leave (each one) after I got tired of trying to champion better ways of doing things.",1309529211

Rather, the hash of the password supplied by the user is compared against the hash value stored in the database.  Given a sufficiently strong password P, it should be computationally infeasible for anyone to compute the value of P from hash(P).",1309529112

2718356,comment,2718227,2718227,3,0,zwieback,,,"Very good summary of German economic thinking - the goal of combining a free market with a fair amount of redistribution has broad support. The German constitution defines Germany as a ""Sozialstaat"", which is not quite the same as what we call ""welfare state"" in the US but seeks to create social justice.<p>What's not mentioned is the remarkable fact that Germany was able to absorb the collapse of economically completely dysfunctional East Germany. If anything, the influx of a generation of Germans raised under ""socialism"" has strengthened the base of voters valuing economic stability. Despite western grumblings and the still existing Wessi/Ossi divide the reunification and subsequent wealth transfer from West to East was largely viewed as something that just had to be done.<p>It's hard to measure the performance of Germany over other large economies in isolation of the current state of the European Union, though. I think the opinion about Germany is quite different in other European nations, especially Greece. There you would find a large number of people claiming the performance of Germany's economy is at the expense of the smaller countries of the union.",1309529023

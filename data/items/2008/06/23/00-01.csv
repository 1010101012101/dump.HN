I had a summer job doing IT-ish things in a small accountancy a couple years ago, at the end of the two months I was about to kill myself from the boredom and monotony.<p>That expert advice is valuable - thank you. I'm currently interested in programming language theory (prompted by steve yegge), we'll see where that takes me.<p>I'm trying hard with the friends thing, but there are precious few who don't ""submit"" to the partying culture.",1214182785
224555,comment,224520,224520,0,0,ctkrohn,,,"See what else is out there.  Computers might be fascinating, but until you learn about a bunch of other fields, you will never know if they're what fascinates you most.  Take as many classes as you can in as many areas as you're interested in, and be sure to take lots of classes outside your major.  Finish more than one major.  Join a sports team or club where you'll meet people you wouldn't otherwise.  Save the specialization for your senior thesis, grad school, or for your job.  Try to meet people with a wide variety of interests, so you can make a truly informed decision between majors and career paths.<p>Others may tell you to choose an field of study early on and become an expert.  I definitely admire that goal, but I don't think college is the place.  Most underclassmen have no idea what really interests them; I certainly didn't.",1214182723

If you think you might want to start a startup, go that route, but it won't hurt to do an internship at a big company either (it's actually probably better than working at one after you graduate, but I wouldn't know first hand).<p>If you want to go the startup route, I'd recommend just sending emails to a bunch of startups you like.  Most of them probably aren't actively seeking interns, but would be at least intrigued by the opportunity.",1214182490

I redid (as all freshmen tend to do) the paper's website, which was a huge learning experience.<p>A lot of publications seem to have problems getting themselves online - collegepublisher is the witness. So you seem to be in a viable area.<p>Most of the misery was from schoolwork, which is improving slowly. The social side is at a standstill, because I really don't like beer. It's a catch-22 from where I stand. I think I've always <i>just</i> focused on what was fun/interesting and ignored much else, which you can't do in college, at least academically. I want the liberal arts anti-focus, but of course didn't realize it would be this hard.",1214182477

I'm taking two classes over the summer to start my Jr. year on time.While I can't give you advice from historical experience, I can tell you what I'm doing.<p>Right now I'm using this time to save up some money. I know that I ultimately want to start a company, but I don't know what type (startup, lifestyle) or even in what industry. I do know that I like technology, but I don't think that I would be able to use my skills to compete in that industry, though I may be able to use my knowledge there to give myself an advantage somewhere else. Right now I'm doing what I can to see what my interests are, so that I have a plan after college.<p>I see college as two things: A way to meet people and build my network, and a plan B should the ""own my own business"" plans fall through.",1214182288

Anyways, my point was that shy people have this weird thing where they tend to only say really nice, sugary things. It comes off a little odd (or so I've heard).

It doesn't have to be complicated, it just has to indicate that you can accomplish something on your own.<p>Remember that becoming an expert in anything takes 10 years, so assuming you are around 20, think about what you would like to be an expert at when you are 30 and start working on it regularly.<p>Edit: One more thing -- college can be one of the last times in your life when it is trivial to make new friends.

224543,comment,224520,224533,0,0,izaidi,,,"That's good to hear -- I ran a paper in college and it was an awesome experience. This is such a hugely transformational period in publishing that knowing the ins and outs of the business makes you aware of how many opportunities there are right now. My current startup is intended to help small magazines and campus publications establish an online presence and being able to draw on personal experience makes me way more confident in its ability to succeed.<p>But yeah, I was in a similar boat in terms of the ADHD and not fitting into the general party culture and everything kind of fell into place when I started focusing on doing stuff that was actually fun to do and not so much on stuff I assumed I was supposed to be doing (i.e., my homework).",1214182057

I want excitement (see ADHD, above).<p>Interesting article with a twist:\n[<a href=""http://articles.moneycentral.msn.com/Investing/StockInvestingTrading/CanYogaHelpMakeYouRich.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">http://articles.moneycentral.msn.com/Investing/StockInvestin...</a>]<p>Re: fear and finances, this presentation from Ignite Portland might alter your thinking: ""Once upon a time, in the midst of war, I went to Afghanistan with one hundred dollars to my name, a one-way airplane ticket and no promise of a job."" [<a href=""http://is.gd/Bvc"" rel=""nofollow"">http://is.gd/Bvc</a>]<p>I would recommend doing what you fear. Growth comes from pushing yourself. As a contrived example, if talking to beautiful women scares you.. talk to strangers in controlled situations (art galleries, sporting events). One of the best ways to meet people is where you have continuity - e.g. you see them regularly. Some of the most interesting people I know are interesting because they know people of all interests, vertical groups. Join groups that you have an interest in but are not already skilled in. True networkers connect people who might never meet together.<p>Sometimes a personality test can help you learn more about who you are. People like to give advice but sometimes don't because it might offend inadvertently.. perhaps you can talk to someone who is known you for a long time and ask them for advice? This one linked below is expensive but better than the Myers-Brigg test.\n<a href=""http://www.kolbe.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.kolbe.com</a>",1214181912

224536,comment,224407,224450,0,0,neilk,,,"Okay, I think I get it now. You want the user to ""stretch"" the DOM element representing a schedule item, and then when the user is done stretching, you will translate the movement into a real start and end time.<p>To borrow MVC terminology, your DOM element is then effectively a controller + view in one. Just like we might translate a slider at 50% into 128/256, it's okay to take its properties and then translate those into your model. Presumably you poll the DOM object as it is being dragged, or fire off events when it stops being dragged, which updates the model in near-real-time. Do I understand it?<p>This is actually a good idea then. Although you want to be careful that your controller doesn't rely on magic constants to do its conversion, it should derive those from some initialization from something representing a ""layout"". But you seem to have done this.<p>To get back to your original question... I did find the code hard to read. I don't have the time to unravel it to make it clearer, but personally, I always like to state the problem as clearly as I can up front, in an expression that approaches pseudocode. Like ""return getStartOfWeekTime(el) + getOffsetTime(el)"". This hides away the hard bits in smaller routines, and the clueless maintenance programmer (i.e. you in one month) will understand what's going on right away and where the bugs might be. But if this is too slow you may have to bite the bullet and live with something hard to read.",1214181627
224535,comment,224460,224460,0,0,wumi,,,"first, people have to care enough before they can change the world. in my experiences, many people just don't care about anything outside of their immediate surroundings, for better or worse.<p>second, the barrier to entry for a web 2.0 company relative to a company that will organize the world's health, hunger,thirst, etc. is a few orders of magnitude lower.<p>I've got a few friends with prototypes for companies that could effect serious change on the scale Umair constantly references, but they'd need several millions of dollars before having something that's even ready for mass production.<p>(edit: these buddies of mine, will end up working for corporate america in non-innovative companies because they just don't have the resources to be able to take their prototypes and build them into companies. One of the guys would need about 18 months and 6 full-time research technicians/machinists.)<p>even with PG's ""be good"" it's debatable how much the majority of YC companies are going to have a positive impact on the world ... but then again, is that their aim?<p>maybe Fred, Umair, and a few other big players idea/operations/capital wise should start a YC to attack those very problems with young, hungry, entrepreneurs. $250-$500k per entrepreneur should be fairly reasonable to get to marketable prototype/ alpha version.",1214181486

I've thought many times about dropping out (of college), but I seriously don't have a plan, aside from the vague notion of ""going to SF and figuring something out"". Besides, it seems like a good idea to get a college degree + the CS/Math sophistication alongside it.

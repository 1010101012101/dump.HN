I was looking into it recently, as I was considering hiring someone, but it looks like I don&#x27;t need to at the moment, so I haven&#x27;t looked at the details closely.  My understanding is that the main issue you might have is a small capital requirement and/or income to show that you can support the employee.  I&#x27;ve talked with people who have sponsored foreign English teachers and they have told me that they had absolutely no difficulty (though this was several years ago -- things might have changed).<p>I haven&#x27;t actually read the fine article yet, but I&#x27;m not really sure what would attract people to doing start ups in Japan.  Hiring locals is difficult because of the way the job system works -- people don&#x27;t change jobs every few years.  It&#x27;s quite a bit cheaper to live here than many other places in the world, but it is culturally very different.  I spent 5 years here teaching English amongst many young (mostly American) colleagues.  I wouldn&#x27;t bring people over here unless you are prepared to help them out a lot when they inevitably get in trouble (shuddering recalling the experience of having to help my colleague who punched a police officer).  It&#x27;s a big commitment.  Also, unless you have a lot of experience with Japanese culture yourself, it can be a bit tricky to handle all of the business issues.  For my business, I write code and leave all the business issue to my Japanese wife (even though I am quite fluent in Japanese).  Without her and my accountant, I would be lost.<p>But, of course, Japan is an amazing place if you are the kind of person who fits in here.  I wouldn&#x27;t want to live anywhere else.",1440935997

People always forget about indirect cost when talking about cheap nuclear energy (risk factors aside). Nobody has never build a profitable nuclear power plant without substantial government subsidies (way higher than for all renewable energy sources). Operators need government help for security, fuel supply, waste handling and much more. There is no insurance company on earth which will cover a nuclear power plant without state guarantees (ask yourself: Wouldn&#x27;t a profit oriented insurance company cover these risks, of these were really as low and controllable as people say here?).",1440935876

I have a use case where I need to launch the Lync application conversation window from my application.
I need to start a Conversation Window with the emailID i provide in the intent.
my code :-
if (lyncDoesExist()) {<p><pre><code>            Uri lyncUri = Uri.parse(&quot;lync://aaa.bbb@ccc.com&quot;);
            Intent myIntent = new Intent(Intent.ACTION_VIEW);

            myIntent.addCategory(Intent.CATEGORY_DEFAULT);
            startActivity(myIntent);

        }</code></pre>
This just starts the HubActivity ( the Lync application) .
It doesnot start the ConversationWindowActivity  (the chat window of the specific email id that I passed)
Am I missing anything in the code above ? I need to open the conversation window.
FYI - I also tried using Uri lyncUri = Uri.parse(&quot;sip:aaa.bbb@ccc.com&quot;); but android says no activity found to handle the request.
Kindly help . I need this urgently.<p>Thanks,

The absolute amount of money available is pretty large, but for a variety of pipeline reasons, I would not assume it was easily accessible for a variety of firms that would have an easy time accessing Meaningful Amounts of Money in the Bay Area as of 2015 (or any time for the last 10 years, for that matter).<p>b) Talent market: with specific regards to foreign entrepreneurs hiring in Tokyo, I often find that they have... interesting expectations.  &quot;Hey I&#x27;d like to find a bilingual Japanese/English engineer who has startup-compatible risk tolerances, is comfortable working in a bicultural environment under a minimum amount of supervision, can solo-ship code in one or more modern programming stacks, and is willing to work for $2.5k per month.&quot;  I think if you also have this expectation, you will not find the Tokyo labor market to be accommodating of your desires.<p>Assuming one is reasonably clueful with regards to looking for folks who actually exist...  I think one would be a bit disappointed with regards to who actually exists and it what quantity.  It&#x27;s a minor miracle that one can reliably staff a team of 20 engineers to build a never-before-seen highly scalable application out of nothing to do something which is actually meaningful.  You can accomplish this miracle in the Bay Area.  It will be expensive, but it is doable, and you&#x27;ll be one of <i>hundreds of firms doing it at the same time</i>.  In Tokyo...  you&#x27;re going to find that individual pieces of that 20-strong team are very, very hard to find.  A CTO who has done it before?  An architecture lead who is both capable of making good choices and will also happily actually touch an AWS account with their own two hands?  An intermediate Rails or Python developer who can both ship code and is willing to work for you?  Times five?  <i>Every</i> hire there is a fun adventure which might end in &quot;And then despite everyone&#x27;s best efforts there was no engineer available for hire and the company died ingloriously.&quot;<p>c)  Ambient competence levels among Tokyo entrepreneurs and other people associated with the startup ecosystem are... how to be charitable here... lagging ambient competence levels in Silicon Valley.

In reality there are several differences, and the biggest piece of misinformation is that measurement of one system somehow &quot;collapses a wave function&quot; in the other system which isn&#x27;t the case.<p>The phenomenon of entanglement is that measurements of certain things are either perfectly correlated or anti-correlated. Eg. Measurement of spin along some axis on electron A will always be -1 when measurement of spin along the same axis of electron B is +1.<p>The similarity to 2 coins is: if i have a 1972 coin and a 1973 coin, and give one to you randomly, then you go a million light years away and look at your coin and find you have the 1973 coin, you will know I have the 1972 coin. Although this is only a simplified analogy of entanglement the important point is that the state was prepared before we separated, and no information has been communicated.

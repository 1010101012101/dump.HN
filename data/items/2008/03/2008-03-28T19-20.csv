148802,comment,148672,148672,0,0,nickb,,,"Having a user's email can be extremely useful and many times necessary. When you make changes to your TOS/privacy policy, you can send them notifications. When they receive an internal private message, you can send them a notification. You can also send them updates about your service. Also, email is probably still the most powerful marketing vehicle. If you ignore it, you've just lost a very powerful ally in your path to success.<p>Now, how you collect this email is also extremely important. The best way to collect emails is through double-opt-in. User first requests to receive messages from you (a checkmark during the signup is sufficient) and then they confirm the subscription when they receive the email. Why is this important? It prevents people from claiming that you're a spammer. If you follow this procedure and if you keep these records (i.e. dates, IPs etc), you can defend your email when you get spam complaints from other postmasters. It is CRITICAL that you followup on these spam reports since you can easily get blacklisted on all of the email services and your emails will never be delivered. If you use email list services (like Aweber etc),they require you use double opt-in and won't allow you to add an email without it. I like these various email contact services since they deliver emails to inboxes of pretty much all of the email service providers and they fight every spam report on your behalf.<p>So yeah, I understand the need to have an easy signup but you should also think ahead. My suggestion is to start with no double opt-in and add it later on as your site grows and you start receiving spam complaints.",1206733506

It will not kill a programmer to spend some time running a few models on how they can actually monetize the service, just as it is not beyond the scope of any biz/marketing person to understand that building something users want is job #1.<p>where many people stumble is thinking in one dimension terms, like assuming Adsense is a business model (see recent posts by Josh Koppelman and Jeremy Lui) on just how big you need to be for this to be truly viable.<p>What I liked in the original article is that it offered a few, less obvious options for monetization.",1206733224

148789,comment,148617,148617,0,0,angstrom,,,"I think it's a combination of Vista and XBox 360. When Windows 95 came out it used both game support and office applications to become the defacto standard in businesses and homes. XP brought solid compatibility and durability. Vista became Windows ME part deux. There's no need to buy a new computer when the 360 has shifted the hardcore gamers away from the PC. And although Office 2007 is the first significant improvement in 10 years, the fact that you don't need Vista to use it detracts from any tie in possibilities. Now throw on top of this the estimated 33% failure rate of XBox 360s and there isn't much to brag and toot their horn about.",1206732465

You have a bunch of ""Register now"" links, but without some idea of what the site is, there's no reason for anyone to register.  This is a fairly serious deal breaker that will significantly limit your rate of adoption.<p>2.  Email confirmation sign up:  Once again, this will limit the number of people who sign up.  Requiring users to first give you their email, and only then register once they've received it, is slow and outdated.  I'd remove the confirmation step entirely, but if you really feel you need it you should allow the user to first sign up and only then confirm.<p>3+ The concept vaguely intrigued me (what little of it I could glean from your confusing videos on the main page), but for this to be successful you need to seriously revamp your site.  To be frank, it looks like something made in a previous era of web development.<p>Interfaces should be easy to use and clearly laid out.  Yours does not provide enough information at the start, and presents too many irrelevant pieces upon login.<p>As in all startups, the ideas behind them could be great, unique, groundbreaking, etc.  but if the implementation isn't up to snuff you'll go nowhere.<p>I realize this criticism may be harsh, but you did ask how to gain a more widespread user base.

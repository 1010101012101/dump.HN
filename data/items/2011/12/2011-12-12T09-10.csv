So the point here. The % of developers that can do the work.<p>Yes, there are pretty impressive developers in my country. But what's their numbers and what are they doing now (either hired, working abroad or running their own businesses)? Are there a new and constant supply of good devs so you don't run out of them (considering you have the money)? Are they enough so that you company can scale when needed? Is there good sales people, managers, office assistants (because you don't only need developers for you business)? Is there a good infra-structure (Internet, Telecom, Importing stuff, Airports...)?<p>Factor all this and you'll find that third-world countries make no sense to run high yield businesses.",1323683713

3342996,comment,3341109,3341751,1,0,Sandman,,,"Well, this is not <i>exactly</i> what I want. You can catch exceptions by type, but only from some code (for example, a Java library) that actually throws different types of exceptions. In Gosu, I can't <i>throw them by type</i>, at least from what I've seen. I can only throw some generic type of exception (or is it an error? Or something else that implements Throwable? Who knows, Gosu doesn't tell you anything about that) that contains some expression (a String literal), and then anybody who wants to catch it, needs to know that exact expression in order to catch the exception.<p>The more I think about it, the more terrible this looks. I can't even specify to the users of my code which exceptions they should look after (because, it seems, Gosu doesn't allow the throwing of checked exceptions and the 'throws' clause). So if I write some kind of library in Gosu, and if that library is throwing exceptions, I'm basically forcing the users of my library to catch this generic exception (or whatever it is), then put a breakpoint in the catch block and every time something gets caught inspect the expression, hoping that if they test long enough they'll find all of my expressions. Then, they need to write code that covers all the possible cases (a bunch of ""if"" statements).<p>I sincerely hope that I somehow completely misunderstood what Gosu is trying to do here, because otherwise this is just a terrible solution. That would be a real shame though, because, other than this, I honestly like the language.",1323683334

3342992,comment,3341343,3342636,3,0,calibraxis,,,"I'm kind of an interested dabbler in such brain hacking... one principle I try to follow is to use multiple parts of (that conglomerate called) my mind to learn things. So for example, take programming techniques. Using data-directed programming techniques lets me use the visual parts of my mind more directly... so in Lisp or Javascript, you'd make a pretty datastructure which you'd code plumbing to interpret. Same with drawing pictures to help visualize, such as graphs. (The old _Data and Reality_ mentions we frequently use graphs in representing concepts on the computer, as opposed to in data processing.)<p>And using a REPL is very interactive, and uses my kinesthetic parts. (Some emacs chords may have that effect too, like paredit's alt-shift-(, which surrounds the next form in a parenthesis bubble.)<p>Alan Kay mentions the study of like 50 mathematicians, how they thought. Surprisingly few thought in terms of symbols. Most were primarily visual thinkers. Some were also kinesthetic. (To lend credibility, people always mention Einstein was in this last kinesthetic group.)<p>Another is critical learning. So you try to question why something Is The Way It Is, why someone believes what they believe... (Being confused is a very good sign; explore the confusion. Confusion over very simple things led to revolutions in our knowledge.) This takes you from the role of passive learner to co-creator. (Of course, time is limited, and taking this to its logical extreme would mean you'd do multiple ten-year research projects... Might be great for humanity's knowledge, but few of us have this luxury.)",1323683187

I found myself to consciously working on NOT using Google for everything - I use them for general search, gmail and Analytics. That I think is more than enough. My social graph is on Facebook, bookmarks are on ReadItLater and files are in Dropbox, and I am not going to change it even if Google offering is comparable.<p>My longterm strategy is to use different companies for different services. It is a slightly bigger hassle than to have everything integrated by one company, but not that a big hassle, after all. My goal for the future is that Google will own only my search strings, and not much else. I would even like to replace Gmail, but didn't find an alternative yet (but live.com looks promising).",1323683006

Only a handful of my friends use G+, and they are the web/coder guys.  All the social butterflies, the girls, the parties, and the pictures post on Facebook.  It seems to me that many of my peers' internet surfing these days consists almost entirely of hanging out on Facebook.  They have never heard of reddit, they don't follow blogs, they have no compelling interest in international news or trends, and if they have heard of G+ they consider it irrelevant.  I think there is a key demographic of extroverts around which social gatherings coalesce that G+ needs to start making a dent in if they ever want to dethrone Facebook as the social space.<p>The other thing that concerns me is Google's prior lack of commitment to these types of projects.  Facebook did not succeed only because it was better than myspace, I believe it was also due to just how bad myspace became that people started actively looking for an alternative.  Remember the terrible auto-start songs, horribly mangled html templates, creepy spam and rampant security flaws?  It might be the case that in a few years Facebook will start to implode in much the same way.  Too many crappy Zynga games, an increasinly cluttered interface, questionable privacy compromises, a constant battering of status minutia updates and/or some catastrophic privacy event might drive people to begin migration to a new service.  That might take years though.  My question is, will G+ still be there, ready to accept them with a stable of polished features and seamless integration to the entire Google application lineup?  Or will Google have abandoned G+ years ago, the same way it did with Wave and countless other ""experiments""...",1323682907

3342928,comment,3341308,3341308,2,0,MrScruff,,,"As another recent convert to Vim, I always get something out of reading these articles. However my primary advice would be to just accept that the process of learning Vim is inherently painful, but the suffering is mostly over after a couple of months. Expect your productivity to drop during this period though.<p>It's also true that Vim 'suffers' from the open source infinite configurability issue. That is, it is so configurable that you'll spend a significant amount of time configuring it to your tastes rather than getting work done. This tails off over time of course. Slightly more awkward is that it's also easy to shoot yourself in the foot. For example my current config has an issue where on rare occasions undo sporadically fails, and ends up undoing line insertions by deleting the wrong line! Ouch. I still have several such issues, but not enough to deter me as yet.<p>Another thing to consider is that Vim is not equally suited to all developers. If you're editing a bunch of different file types with mostly consistent libraries I think it's a great fit, which describes a lot of web developers. In that case you just want world class text editing. If you're editing mostly C++ with a bunch of different APIs and libraries, the loss of decent codesense/autocomplete forces you into lots of very slow doxygen searching in a browser. I've tried various solutions to this such as clang complete and eclim, but ultimately Vim is not an IDE and there's no way to make it act as one.<p>Overall I'm happy to have made the switch though, since the editing itself is so very smooth. It's great to have the same environment in a remote shell as well.",1323681202

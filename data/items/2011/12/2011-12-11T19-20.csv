There was a semi-raw migration to add it:<p><a href=""https://github.com/documentcloud/documentcloud/blob/master/db/migrate/20110429150927_add_data_to_documents.rb"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/documentcloud/documentcloud/blob/master/d...</a><p>The ""Docdata"" model handles serializing JSON hashes of keys -> string values into the hstore format, and parsing 'em back out. This is a little loose, but works for most of the simple things you'd like for tagging documents (senator: Kerry, statecode: WV, recordid: 019281)<p><a href=""https://github.com/documentcloud/documentcloud/blob/master/app/models/docdata.rb"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/documentcloud/documentcloud/blob/master/a...</a><p>... the resulting effect is that from the Rails side, working with ""document.data"" directly is like working with a lazy-loaded hash.<p>The more interesting bit is the search side of things, here's the query parser and query object (which generates SQL and Solr queries):<p><a href=""https://github.com/documentcloud/documentcloud/blob/master/lib/dc/search/parser.rb"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/documentcloud/documentcloud/blob/master/l...</a><p><a href=""https://github.com/documentcloud/documentcloud/blob/master/lib/dc/search/query.rb"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/documentcloud/documentcloud/blob/master/l...</a><p>... for any given query, we detect if Solr is required (if full-text is involved), or if the search can be satisfied purely in Postgres. So there's one way of generating the key:value query for each back end.<p>Hope that answers the question.<p>(Edit:) Forgot to mention that we add a little extra on top of vanilla hstore ""key:value"" queries. You can write ""dob: *"" to show documents with any senator tagged, and ""dob: !"" to show documents that haven't been tagged with a date of birth yet.",1323633570

This suggests to me that there is a lot of room for improving on first attempts.<p>Are there any useful guides or empirical evidence (I'm thinking A/B and multivariate tests) that suggest what needs to be on the page?<p>I understand of course that each app is different and will require some customization, but as someone coming to this without experience, I'm lost as to site features. Should we include Facebook share buttons? Are longer or shorter pages better? Does motion (video or otherwise) help sell apps or does it distract visitors?

Both genders respond negatively to threats. That's no justification for claiming women are inferior!<p>An even more vivid example: Jane Elliott's Blue Eyes/Brown Eyes test:<p>""Steven Armstrong was the first child to arrive in Elliott’s classroom on that day, asking why ""that King"" (referring to Martin Luther King Jr.) was murdered the day before. After the rest of the class arrived, Elliott asked them what the children knew about blacks. The children responded with various racial stereotypes such as ignorance, unemployment, and common labels to those of Native Americans or Blacks[citation needed]. She then asked these children if they would like to try an exercise to feel what it was like to be treated the way a colored person is treated in America, mentioning that it would be interesting if there was segregation based on eye color instead of skin color. The children enthusiastically agreed to try the exercise.[1]<p>On that day, she designated the blue-eyed children as the superior group. Elliott provided brown fabric collars and asked the blue-eyed students to wrap them around the necks of their brown-eyed peers as a method of easily identifying the minority group. She gave the blue-eyed children extra privileges, such as second helpings at lunch, access to the new jungle gym, and five extra minutes at recess.[citation needed] The blue-eyed children sat in the front of the classroom, and the brown-eyed children were sent to sit the back rows. The blue-eyed children were encouraged to play only with other blue-eyes and to ignore those with brown eyes. Elliott would not allow brown-eyed and blue-eyed children to drink from the same water fountain, and often chastised the brown-eyed students when they did not follow the experiment's rules or made mistakes. She often exemplified the differences between the two groups by singling out students, and would use negative aspects of brown-eyed children to emphasize. Elliott observed that the students' reaction to the discrimination exercise showed immediate changes in their personalities and interaction with each other as early as the first 15 minutes.<p>At first, there was resistance among the students in the minority group to the idea that blue-eyed children were better than brown-eyed children. To counter this, Elliott used pseudo-scientific explanations for her actions by stating that the melanin responsible for making blue-eyed children also was linked to their higher intelligence and learning ability. Shortly thereafter, this initial resistance fell away. Those who were deemed “superior” became arrogant, bossy and otherwise unpleasant to their “inferior” classmates. Their grades also improved, doing mathematical and reading tasks that seemed outside their ability before. The “inferior” classmates also transformed – into timid and subservient children, including those who had previously been dominant in the class. These children’s academic performance suffered, even with tasks that had been simple before.<p>The following day, Elliott reversed the exercise, making the brown-eyed children superior. While the brown-eyed children did taunt the blue-eyed in ways similar to what had occurred the previous day, Elliott reports it was much less intense. At 2:30 on that Wednesday, Elliott told the blue-eyed children to take off their collars and the children cried and hugged one another. To reflect on the experience, she had the children write letters to Coretta Scott King and write compositions about the experience.[1]""<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jane_Elliott"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jane_Elliott</a>",1323633102

3340770,comment,3339291,3339898,2,0,jeromeparadis,,,"I've never had problems with the traditional method of the developer enhancing the designer's static HTML file to make them dynamic. further down the road, it's pretty rare presentation tweaks will break the tempting logic.<p>However, the biggest problem I've had with any designer is the refactoring of html ids and class that breaks AJAX or jQuery code. So the remaining problem, which is the biggest in my opinion, isn't addressed in your approach. Designers still need to be aware of jQuery/AJAX application logic to avoid breaking stuff. My approach to this problem is to use and document custom HTML properties for your jQuery/AJAX hooks. However, it doesn't solve the problem of updating part of the presentation which still relies on the markup structure.<p>EDIT:<p>But you still can rely on custom HTML properties to define updatable sections. While I find this approach better, a designer can still screw this by refactoring and omitting these custom properties.<p>So, relying on IDs and classes through server-side DOM manipulation further acerbates the problem. It's an approach of relying on markup on the server side instead of simply rendering. It adds an additional layer of possible breakage.",1323631227

It was a great place, and I'd love to work there full-time when I graduate this spring. However, at the end of my internship I was not offered a position. It was the company's first year of having  interns, so I can't tell if this was because they chose to not extend an offer, if they had forgotten about it, or if they assumed I knew I would have one if I asked.<p>I don't think I performed astonishingly, but I was assigned relatively mundane tasks and performed them well, and I thought I fit in and was on par with the full-time employees (given a year or two of experience). I know that taking initiative to do impressive things is important, but the mundane tasks I was given were nonetheless important and time-consuming (it would have been irresponsible to shirk them to do less important, flashier things). I fear that the other interns (there were 2), who performed about as well but were given sexier tasks came off as much better full-time candidates.<p>I think my options are: (1) ask the other interns if they received offers (though only 1 is graduating this year), and assume that I was intentionally not given one if they did; (2) ask the company if I have an offer. Both are awkward situations, but going directly to the company seems like the right thing to do.<p>I'd also like to know if this is a situation that could actually happen accidentally. Basically, am I in denial for thinking that a company would actually forget to extend an offer to a candidate they want? Or is it completely paranoid of me to think any of this, given that I seemed to fit in well? If it is extremely unlikely that my employers could have forgotten and it should be obvious that I don't have an offer, is it rude of me to put them in an awkward spot by having to formally reject me?<p>Because I assumed this position wasn't guaranteed, I have been applying elsewhere and have offers at other companies now. But this company was kind of my ideal job, so I'd really like to return. What should I do?",1323631204

I very strongly believe that piracy does hurt someone in the music industry, not the artist, but rather the major record labels.<p>I remember seeing stats 4 years ago that the income of a musician is actually going up pretty drastically because musicians are starting to go independent (book their own shows, record and release their own records, get their own shirts made to sell).<p>It takes a lot more work, and a lot of musicians just want to be in the music industry for the music, but they have to (and are starting to) accept that taking part in the business side of the industry will help put more food on their plates and give them nice places to live.<p>The major record labels will probably stay around for a long time thanks to highly commercial pop/rap artists, but it currently looks like they are attacking everything around them in a desperate attempt to keep all these artists going independent, and to keep the (relatively small) amount of revenue lost from piracy.<p>It is absolutely nuts that musicians used to get 5 cents for a record sale, and it is an absolute blessing that independent artists are getting most of the money from their record sales!<p>For purposes of what I posted I think it's good to consider artists who sell music via Topspin, Tunecore etc. as independent artists.",1323631179

3340763,comment,3337804,3338744,1,0,karamazov,,,"For reference, MIT has two undergrad courses - 6.006 and 6.046 - which use CLRS, covering about half the book each.  An undergrad course at MIT is expected to take up about 140 hours, including lectures, reading, and assignments.  So, working for 10 hours per day, one could theoretically complete each course in two weeks.<p>There are a few other things to consider.  One is that it's probably not necessary to go through all of the material to be able to manage interview-type questions.  (It would obviously be best to undertand CLRS from cover to cover for the purpose of becoming a better engineer, but that's not what's under discussion.)<p>Second, it's really questionable whether someone can effectively work for 10 hours per day on this sort of material.  My guess is that people fall into two categories - those who are not used to algorithmic thinking, and those who are.  People from the first category would not be able to absorb that much new information that quickly, so for them, what I said is inaccurate.  However, people in the second category would not only be able to process CLRS in large batches, but would need much less than 140 hours to work through half the book; someone familiar with the underlying concepts (basic programming, probability, etc.) and with a background in proofwriting could very well get through enough information to answer interview questions twice as fast or faster, so in about a week or less.",1323631039

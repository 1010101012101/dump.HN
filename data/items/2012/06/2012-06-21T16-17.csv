4142945,comment,4142743,4142743,5,0,grabeh,,,"My original thought when hearing about the prospect of new gTLDs was that a central body would look to claim a descriptive term such as 'blog' and make it available to anyone who wanted to host a blog under set criteria, and provided that centralised body committed to providing access to anyone under reasonable terms. This would act as a guarantee of origin of the site and would be helpful to consumers.<p>I don't therefore see an issue with the registration of new descriptive gTLDs but only if access is provided in line with the above. The issue with Amazon/Google's land grab is that we cannot guarantee the basis on which access will be made available which could in turn lead to segregation, particularly if google were to control a gTLD and also provide greater prominence to it in search results.<p>At the present moment in time, it is the lack of certainty in the process which is troubling.

Whoever was in charge of disaster recovery obviously didn't really understand the risk.<p>Just like the recent outages of Heroku and EC2, and just like the financial crisis of 2008 which was laughably called a ""16-sigma event"", it seems pretty clear that the actual assessment of risk is pretty poor.  The way that Heroku failed, where invalid data in a stream caused failure, and the way that EC2 failed, where a single misconfigured device caused widespread failure, just shows that the entire area of risk management is still in its infancy.  My employer went down globally for an entire day because of an electrical grid problem, and the diesel generators didn't failover properly, because of a misconfiguration.<p>You would think after decades that there would be a better analysis and higher-quality ""best practices"", but it still appears to be rather immature at this stage.  Is this because the assessment of risk at a company is left to people that don't understand risk, and that there is an opportunity for ""consultants"" who understand this, kind of like security consultants?",1340297695

A member of my extended family does extensive work with deaf young children (aged six months to six years). Her job is to accelerate their spoken-language development, which has been delayed by virtue of being deaf. She repeatedly makes the point to me that the difference between children with delayed language (e.g. most of those she works with) and a ""normal"" child is that those with delayed language tend to not understand (or use) abstractions in their speech. They treat each word as if it has a single application or use. Once they understand that each word actually can have multiple applications, their ability to learn new words grows exponentially. Until that point, they are simply mimicking.<p>That sounds like an abstract fundamental to me, though I am perhaps mistaken. (This is also subject to a counter-argument about the nature/nurture aspect of language, e.g. do we have an inborn understanding of language.)<p>Also, on a more personal note: by the time I was five, I was experimenting with electrical circuits. A few 1.5V flashlight bulbs, a pair of switches, a few D-cell batteries, and some wire went a long way. I taught myself that you couldn't put lightbulbs after each other and have them light up to the same brightness (e.g. series resistance), but that you could connect them in parallel without any of those effects (these were short-term, so I didn't notice the extra power draw). Likewise for switches -- if they were in parallel, then breaking one was enough to break the entire circuit. Those are brand-new, abstract concepts that I was, as you say, internalizing in an intellectual sense.<p>And no, I wouldn't have called my IQ particularly high at the time, and I still would not.",1340297461

But, Vagrant is not the ultimate solution for me. I don't think it exists, of course. My wish list is too long but...<p>I want something that:
1) Runs completely locally. I want to be able to work offline, on a plane, whatever without needing remote resources.<p>2) Minimizes dependencies. Adding chef cookbook servers, apt-get, etc. into the mix is another point of failure.<p>3) Is scalable/reusable. Most people/companies have multiple projects they work on and much of the vagrant/(chef|puppet) architecture doesn't easily support diverse workloads (this project needs recipes x,y,z, this one needs a,b,x,y; this server runs ubuntu 10.10, the other 10.04)<p>4) Is all integrated. Sure, I can use some combination of chef, chef-knife, and chef-librarian but they don't work together in my project. Someone can check in a new project setting and unless I run vagrant up, it'll continue to run happily. I want something like bundler that will fail to run unless I'm all up to date, and is unified into a single package.<p>Given those restrictions, here's what bothers me about the vagrant ecosystem (they're not really complaints about Vagrant per-se but the state of dev virtualization):<p>1) Every project I get needs a VM (unless I want to start installing stuff locally). This increases the amount of time it takes to get a project up and running. Yes, in the long run it pays off, but can be a barrier to entry for ""I just want to fork a project for a quick bug fix"".<p>2) VirtualBox building is slow, takes forever, and requires gobs of disk space. If I have 4 projects, it seems I need a separate vbox for each one. Now I've got GBs of files littering my filesystem. I'd kill for dedupe.<p>3) Chef / Puppet recipes are one-size-fits-all, and to change them requires adding a whole lot of infrastructure. Sure, you can embed them in your project (chef-solo), but then that's not very reusable.<p>So you can set up your own chef cookbook server, but then it's another moving part that can fail and then no one can provision new VMs. Bleh. We've gone with symlinking our own cookbook repo into our projects. That's suboptimal but avoids a whole lot of yak shaving.<p>What I'd like are more extensible cookbooks that have per-project configuration. Yes, they often have some configurable values, but occasionally I want to use a cookbook but it's got some strange version of a lib in there that is incredibly out of date that I can't change.",1340296969

Without proper access to YouTube, Bing and other search engines cannot stand with Google on an equal footing in returning search results with links to YouTube videos and that, of course, drives more users away from competitors and to Google.<p>Second, in 2010 and again more recently, Google blocked Microsofts new Windows Phones from operating properly with YouTube. Google has enabled its own Android phones to access YouTube so that users can search for video categories, find favorites, see ratings, and so forth in the rich user interfaces offered by those phones.  Its done the same thing for the iPhones offered by Apple, which doesnt offer a competing search service.<p>Unfortunately, Google has refused to allow Microsofts new Windows Phones to access this YouTube metadata in the same way that Android phones and iPhones do.

I suspect the feeling is in large part due to how you are socialized.<p>This is pure speculation - but it is probably important to our social status that we are recognized for our contributions. If others can shamelessly take credit for all our brilliant ideas, they will increase in social status, while we seem not to contribute anything. Thus it makes sense that we would have a deeply seated, hardwired resentment for other people taking credit for our hard work.<p>Even if somebody copies you and then attributes the work to you, some of the credit for the idea still goes to that person rather than to you. Attributions are often overlooked by 'the public' and the social status often still goes to the person they got it from.<p>The power of this kick in the gut may lessen the more comfortable you are with your position, and how well esteemed you feel by the people around you. You may be less opposed to having your work copied if you feel, on a deep, emotional level, that you are still in general highly respected for your contributions even if you 'lose' a few to other people copying them and taking credit.<p>Which reminds me of this comic by Jessica Hagy: <a href=""http://thisisindexed.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/card2752.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://thisisindexed.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/card2752...</a>",1340296709

Many of these programs are more like a class, with structured lessons and methods to success. Attendance might as well be required. YC is more like college: you get out of it what you put in to it. ""office hours"" are named that way for a reason.<p>Independence is a strong part of being an entrepreneur. Of course inexperienced entrepreneurs need help, but having no experience at all is an indicator of probable failure. I can only imagine this is amplified when the mentors and investors lack real startup experience.<p>It also needs to be said that the fallout from failed incubators in smaller cities can be negative.

All with, what, 7 shortcuts?<p>With mouse-based WM's there's click to focus, click and drag, right click, lots of buttons and icons everywhere and you have to constantly work to make the relevant information visible.<p>There's a reason why people don't go back after using tiling WM's - they're <i>easier</i> and more efficient to use than their mouse-based counterparts.<p>Consider that mobile phones use a similar approach by getting rid of the concept of windows and they are, by a long shot, easier for most people to get to grips with. Tiling is a similar concept except that more than one application is visible at the same time. The lack of a window stack helps. Navigating a big physical table covered with pieces of paper (i.e. all applications on the same layer, where the table split into segments - aka desktops) is infinitely easier for a human than a stack of paper (i.e. finding something in a binder or book is more annoying and slower).",1340295756

If the record labels don't know, and 99% of their users don't know, it's probably not even worth their time to protect the mp3 data at all. They can just tell everyone ""oh yeah, we're a streaming service, we don't allow downloads,"" then use some general obfuscation (AKA don't make the download link readily available to non-programmers and music industry execs), put a clause in their license that says you can't store the music you play, and bam, problem never existed in the first place. The most annoying thing for them would probably be the bandwidth usage of people trying to script this and download high volumes of data, but even then only a minor annoyance.<p>The even larger point is: even if I were an Rdio subscriber (I'm actually a Spotify subscriber), I'd still prefer to use their app and service rather than download the files just so I can ""have"" them.

We live on a farm.  They get lots and lots of time to explore outdoors, climb in trees, and all that good stuff that so few kids get these days.  That is really more important to me.<p>You are probably right that they would also be delighted at an iPad.  But what would that achieve?  A simulation of things they could do with paper, out the front door?  Reinforce the message that cool things are expensive and welded shut?<p>Research shows, and I firmly believe, that children need unstructured play.  They need to be able to pretend, to create, to examine, to fail cheaply.  Lots of toys and gadgets don't foster this.

So when a woman who fits this pattern says ""I'm decent at x"", it may be the same as a man saying ""I'm great at x.""<p>--Become a champion for the women in your life who deserve more recognition. Encourage them to take more leadership roles, jump at more speaking gigs when presented with the opportunity, etc. Women will often tend to think ""I'm not ready for that yet"" while a man with similar experience will say ""Yeah, let's go for it!""<p>--Help the youngest girls in your life develop more self-confidence. My cousin, a brilliantly smart teenager, kept telling me, ""I'm terrible at math."" I encouraged her to focus on the positive (she was getting great grades in her math classes, and understood the problem set) and to think more positively about her abilities.<p>This lack of self-confidence is ingrained from an early age in many women and affects us throughout life in many cases. Encouraging girls to think more empowering thoughts and to have more confidence may be the best thing you can do to give them a better chance for success.",1340294965

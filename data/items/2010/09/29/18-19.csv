In theory, people are constantly being kept abreast of their performance, and given opportunities to improve; so that those in the bottom 10% shouldn't be surprised when the end of the year comes and they are laid off.<p>Welch defends the practice by talking about the alternate scenario where people are kept on staff for years who aren't performing well, have never been told that is the case, and are suddenly surprised when one day the company needs to have layoffs and are terminated. He calls it ""false kindness"".<p>I've always like the part of Differentiation where you let people know where they stand.

Upgrading these systems to IE8 can be a very large operation, taking weeks to test and roll out to all users. To test all the web applications currently used by HMG departments can take months at significant potential cost to the taxpayer.

Regarding the burning bridges comment, nothing negative was done on our side, but the level of professionalism was low on theirs and I don't feel this was just an oversight.  We had unreturned emails at the end.  My impression was they were incredibly responsive with immediate returns at the start, then at some point they decided to build it and communication stopped. I wouldn't consider it a negative experience if they had simply said at that time that they were not interested, but they dragged things out another month which was of little utility.  Will be interested to see if our unique features end up in their offering since the dev team was pretty excited about certain things.

However, on the verge of IE9 and HTML5, supporting IE6 is starting to show measurable effects on our development velocity, capability, and agility which impacts all of our customers regardless of browser.<p>I suspect many IT depts and software companies are eating this cost and it reduces the impetus to upgrade browsers.

If the best math tutor in the country lives in New York, and I live in Arizona, I'm out of luck.  I worked for Kaplan, College Network, Sylvan Learning Center, and Veritas Prep...this was always the problem.  If you live in Manhattan, you're in a great place to find GMAT tutors.  If you live in Wyoming, your choices are more limited (noting against Wyoming, but people with high GMAT scores and MBA's tend to be on Wall Street).  A system like this would allow equal access to great tutors, regardless of location.  I know someone who flew a tutor from New York to Miami for tutoring.  So it's not always about price.  If I can get a better tutor online than I can get within driving distance, I'll pay the same or more.",1285784135

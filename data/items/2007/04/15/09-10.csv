Anyway, if you are living in such a cheap area, then you don't need the 15000$, or at least, the equivalent for you would be much less money. I suspect the 15K YC give you are probably spent on the 3 months living in Boston they require you to do. <p>How much do houses cost where you live, btw? I don't think people would be ""gambling away their houses"" by giving you 15K - wouldn't that just be two or three years more of paying off the mortgage?",1176630972

I know they are considered the creme de la creme, but does this make me want to ever communicate with them, like apply for a job? Who knows, I might make a spelling mistake and they would go on and humiliate me in public. No thanks.\n",1176630255

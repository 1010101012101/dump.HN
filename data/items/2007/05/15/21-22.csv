It seems angry people post a lot in succession, especially if they get voted down.  More time to think and cool down.<p>2) Have a short timer (five minutes) stopping you from replying directly to someone who replied to you.  More time to think means logic gets to fight emotion for longer and hopefully win over.  I like reading strong arguments until they degrade into emotional monkey flinging.<p>3) Check for votes for or against a person over a set time frame as well as testing for variety.  This would stop people who get a real hate on for someone and downvoting all their comments to torpedo their karma.<p>4) Force people to enter a reason when they downvote.  Just a simple one line reason that would only be read by the moderators.  Having to stop and think about why you are making a decision and justify it to someone else would cull a lot of the punitive downvotes.  It would also provide you a place to start a dialog with people who aren't adapting well to the site.",1179266387

It's just a number, why care about it?<p>I think Reddit's system works reasonably well: enough downmods and the post is simply hidden.  Trolls <i>do</i> care about attention; if they don't get it, they (usually) stop wasting their time.",1179266095

We'll probably see some of that stuff at WWDC next month. Of course a Macbook Pro with all that would cost close to 3 grand so it's a tradeoff.",1179265090

Further, I just got an email and followed a link back to your site so I could... ...do nothing. Not sure that makes me too excited to click on the next link you send me. <p>Worth rethinking.

The problems really start when you work in an enterprise but you are on a very small team (no greater than 2, but almost always just me), and your boss wants it done in Java for no real good reason.<p>Another problem is that using most Java frameworks is not as simple as including a JAR in the classpath.  They require different amounts of config files and boilerplate start up code.<p>The ultimate problem is that when you've had a taste of metaprogramming, real closures, or some other feature that Java lacks, you find it extremely irritating to lose that power just so that you can say you wrote it in Java.<p>PS. Limewire is a client Java app (or at least loads and looks like one).",1179263201

299227,comment,298436,298918,0,0,ScottWhigham,,,"Wait - you think TC50 is ""high visibility low effort""? I completely disagree.<p><i>""How much work does it take to get in the TC50?""</i> A ton - business planning, networking, product development; it's a lot more than just starting up in some private beta.<p>One question not asked is, ""How much work is required the four weeks before TC?"" Answer: all of your time.<p>Another unasked question is, ""How much time is required the eight weeks after TC?"" Answer: probably all of them for at least 50% of the employees since you must follow up and follow through (investors, demos, press, networking, invitations).<p>That's not low effort at all, neither pre- or post-event; it's probably 8-12 weeks of your time that you aren't doing product development or other marketing. I'll agree that it's high visibility, of course, but don't overhype what it takes to be included and have a successful event.",1220950359

299223,comment,298962,299060,0,0,listic,,,"Spore is not your average game. In fact, I would say that Spore doesn't fit into current classification of games as single-player vs multiplayer; thus brings state of the industry a step further. I.e. you can play your game in single-player mode just fine, but you also can publish your creatures with a press of a button so that they will be saved on game servers, other players can comment them on the Web and may encounter them in their games.<p>You have to prove your point if you want it to be taken seriously.",1220949696

The two big challenges:<p>1) The project deals with separate businesses that all have their own bank accounts.  The money from transactions processed by the app has to be deposited into the bank accounts that belong to individual businesses.  I believe this means that PCI requirements are substantially more onerous for an app like this because my client is classed as a payment service provider, rather than just a user.<p>2) The app must also be able to process card-present transactions, both credit- and debit-card based.  Customers of the businesses (who are the customers of my client) that use the app will often be present to swipe their cards for their payments to be processed.<p>Are you aware of any services or technologies that would make this easier?  So far I think my preference may be for partnership with a vendor who is already PCI-certified and has the pin pads for card-present transactions, whose software has a good API that I can interact with via this web application.<p>I'll be building this in Rails.  I've got lots of experience with traditional e-commerce models, and I'm comfortable with the technical aspects of dealing with multiple bank accounts, but the certification requirements appear to be the major obstacle so far (costing approx $100k, according to my research, for hiring an independent security assessor and working with them to achieve compliance).",1258507458

It's possible (and probable) that companies financed too much and overspent for any assets they bought because of the larger asset bubble we were in since 1998 or 2002 at the latest. Real estate is particularly troubling because over the over investment in one sector, the clustering of errors by so many people, and the pyramiding of debt that fractional reserve banking allows. I'm not sure without specifics you can say anything is coming from that sector of the economy. The specifics listed don't seem to imply any systemic concerns.<p>I'd expect that the commercial real estate bust that we're in right now is far more dangerous than anything described in this article.

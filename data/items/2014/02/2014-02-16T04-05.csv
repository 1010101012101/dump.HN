7246711,comment,7239407,7246459,1,0,gruseom,,,"I don&#x27;t understand most of this. For example, I don&#x27;t know why you say that the async library couldn&#x27;t try-catch every place that an exception might occur (mostly its calls to the functions that get passed in to it). It would be interesting if it couldn&#x27;t, since then we&#x27;d have an example of something macros can do that functions cannot. But it seems obvious to me that it could; you&#x27;d just need a lot of try-catches. What am I missing?<p>As for domains, I don&#x27;t know what you mean by them, but if they&#x27;re catching errors at a higher level than the async library, my guess is that they must be some more sophisticated sort of top-level handler; perhaps something that keeps track of which async calls are in progress and attempts to bind exceptions back to their context? Whatever it is, it sounds complicated.<p>But what I understand least of all is how you guys all seem to write Javascript code that generates almost no exceptions. To me that sounds almost like bug-free code. No null references, for example? I get stuff like that all the time.",1392526746

7246691,comment,7245407,7246130,18,0,vidarh,,,"In Europe, most countries have a reasonable solution: The incumbent telco in most countries have been required to separate out the business unit that owns and operates the cable sufficiently that it can be accounted for separately.<p>This business is then generally required to provide equal access to anyone on a &quot;cost plus&quot; basis exactly because the cost and complexity of laying new cable is considered a massive barrier to competition, and besides we don&#x27;t want a ton of companies digging up the street all the time or erecting new poles.<p>E.g. in the UK, the &quot;last mile&quot; of all landlines installed by BT are now handled by BT OpenReach. Consumers can call their preferred ISP or phone provider and ask them to take over the provision of services on the line, and the ISP deals with BT once you&#x27;ve authenticated the request.<p>The service is then <i>either</i> provided via backhaul over BT&#x27;s network - that is, the ISP provides a few central nodes where they interface with BT, and hands over a raw data stream from each subscriber at those points - <i>or</i> the ISPs pay (on a cost regulated basis) to put equipment in BT&#x27;s echanges. The latter has the advantage that they can offer services BT can&#x27;t/won&#x27;t and that ISPs that depend on backhaul from BT can&#x27;t - some ISPs beat BT in certain areas this way.<p>It&#x27;s not perfect - it&#x27;s limited by BT&#x27;s upgrade/buildout schedule, but BT does face competitive pressure from Virgin (cable provider), and also does face the possibility that someone will able to get finance together to lay cable to compete if they don&#x27;t watch out, though the latter is less likely.<p>But beyond the last mile, there&#x27;s fierce competition.",1392525991

7246624,comment,7243757,7243757,3,0,kolev,,,"I don&#x27;t exercise as I yet have to see data showing me that exercise will increase lifespan by longer than the time invested doing it. Add the opportunity cost of the lost time to the picture as well. Same with sleep. A couple of hours less sleep is a pretty significant increase in real and meaningful lifespan. Will sleeping 8 hours increase your lifespan by a bigger percentage? No, not really. What I definitely think is stupid is overeating and then running to the gym to &quot;burn&quot; the excess calories. First, exercise makes you hungry. Second, are you aware of the vomitories in the Roman Empire - this isn&#x27;t much different. Every expert will tell you that nutrition is more important than exercise. To me, studies about exercise are low quality as people who work out usually watch what they eat as well. Also, it could be the lower abdominal circumference of those who work out, which is a good health predictor. Anyway, I think walking 20-30 mins a day and having sex is what is natural to us. Anything else leads to tear and wear (especially, cartilage), increased metabolism, and aerobic exercise is a significant source of reactive oxygen species, so, you really need to load up on antioxidants <i>before</i> such workout. The slower your metabolism is, the longer you will potentially live (extend odds of getting cancer, hitting the Hayflick limit later, etc.). Intermittent fasting as a caloric restriction regimen seems to be the best option of life extension, which means, two meals a day, even better with one (Warrior Diet). Not having to worry about snacks and eating so often also extends your meaningful lifespan. I&#x27;m sure some gym nazis will downvote me, but whatever - I&#x27;ve invested enough time researching different alternatives of having longer and happier life and I know what&#x27;s best. The only thing I know I should be doing better is stretching. I highly recommend The Longevity Project book - it debunks a lot of myths. Good Calories, Bad Calories is also great although it has a lot of enemies especially in the face of vegetarians and vegans. I believe in it&#x27;s main point as I&#x27;ve increased my caloric intake by hundreds of calories a day, but my weight has actually decreased. I&#x27;m not saying all that Taubes says is right, but if there&#x27;s one thing I got from the book is the realization that human metabolism is oversimplified, it really is not a simple arithmetic formula with just addition and subtraction. Hormones, for example, are very important, and you can talk to people with thyroid disease (hypo or hyper function) to hear how eating less can make you gain weight and how eating more can still make you lose weight. Due to environmental toxins (including those in foods such as endocrine disruptors, antibiotics, etc.), things are getting more and more complicated. Add the fact that our gut microbiota is totally out of whack and things get ugly.",1392523976

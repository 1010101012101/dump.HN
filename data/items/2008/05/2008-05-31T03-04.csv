Bombs during building because SBCL now relies on a link symbol which doesn't exist in Tiger.  Apparently all Mac Lisp users are require to be 10.5 Leopard users.<p>4. Swear a bit.<p>5. Search the web.<p>6. Find lots of people swearing also, no answers.<p>7. Try CVS.<p>8. Build.<p>9. Bombs during build.<p>10. More swearing.<p>11. Start hunting through earlier versions of SBCL.<p>12. About 10 downloads later (and they take a <i>lot</i> of time each to download and build until it fails), finally find one which doesn't rely on the symbol.<p>13. Am now running SBCL.<p>All told, about eight hours.",1212205220

No fancy GUI control panel (at least not that I've noticed), just plain ssh access to a good shell and you're on your way. They answer the phone on the second or third ring, a real human, maybe because most of their users are good enough not to need any support. That being said, I'm now looking for a new provider too, because they host only one domain for the cheap accounts.",1212203567

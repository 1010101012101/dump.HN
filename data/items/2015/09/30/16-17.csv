My average consumption so far over not quite 8,000 miles is 315Wh/mile.<p>It&#x27;s hard to cheat in an electric car. Few people care about efficiency directly, but most electric car drivers care deeply about <i>range</i>, and range is just battery capacity multiplied by efficiency. If Tesla were cheating so they could lie about efficiency, Tesla owners would notice pretty much right away that they&#x27;re not achieving the range they should.<p>The only practical way for Tesla to cheat would be to ship a larger battery than they say they do, and then fudge the numbers from there. Given the current cost of batteries, this would be an incredibly expensive cheat, and it would be tough to hide from the tinkerers who tear down battery packs to see how they&#x27;re built.",1443632375

The SIGINT Philosopher was a regular editorial in this newsletter, and we are lucky to have a couple columns in full. These documents were considered classified.<p>I highly suggest everyone reads the primary source documents in this link-- all of them, not just that single episode from the SIGINT Philosopher. The purpose of this column is to propagandize workers at the NSA and help them to rationalize their complicity in totalitarian surveillance. It&#x27;s pretty disgusting that the NSA brass realize that what they are doing will create cognitive dissonance within their workforce, yet instead of addressing it, opt to deceive internally (and externally) instead.<p>This purpose becomes exceedingly clear when you read the actual columns. In the column I linked, the author describes how if the public only knew a few things about his personal life they would be scared or disgusted, but complete transparency would leave them nothing to fear. This thought is supposedly in reaction to anxiety that the author had as a result of a fumbled polygraph test that he was subjected to. The author claims to be a civil libertarian, but of course, it&#x27;s impossible to be a civil libertarian and also be in favor of a panopticon. A panopticon allows no true freedom, as behavior changes when it is known to be watched by a third party.<p>The NSA hires internal propaganda artists to keep their analysts quiet and happy.

Usually, in my experience, bugs are ideally reported by people after some repeatable / confirmable thought-out process.<p>If I understood you correctly, you are automatically posting every exception to your bug tracker. My point is that not all exceptions are bugs. And certainly not all bugs are discoverable through exceptions.<p>> What sort of separation do you have between application exceptions\n> and other types of exceptions such as database connectivity? How do \n> either of the aforementioned exceptions/errors materialize into a bug?<p>These are great questions that you should be asking while architecting / implementing / testing / running your application (i.e. whole lifecycle).\nAgain, not all exceptions are bugs. Many, but not all exceptions are to die / crash your program. Many exceptions are definitely recoverable (unexpected input), while others are not (failed network, unreachable DB). If you are using a decent logging framework, it’s obvious that they have different levels for logging messages. FATAL/ERROR usually mean unrecoverable, while WARNINGs are typically recoverable but may prompt further investigation for the log audience, and INFO/DEBUG are generally harmless, non-error messages. This design has become widespread across many languages/frameworks and makes you ponder why.<p>> What does your workflow for logging exceptions and errors look like?<p>My view is that error handling is generally a delicate art and science (see why Golang doesn’t have exceptions, a decision made by veteran language designers!). I follow the principle of Fail Fast, especially for unrecoverable errors; that is, don’t hide fatal errors. Bubble up exceptions. Carefully design your layers to raise and catch the appropriate exceptions, if at all (see also Erlang’s let it crash principle). c2 wiki has some good starting discussions: \n<a href=""http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?FailFast"" rel=""nofollow"">http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?FailFast</a>\n<a href=""http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?FirstRuleOfLogging"" rel=""nofollow"">http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?FirstRuleOfLogging</a><p>Note, these are all abstract and conceptual, and not tool oriented. They go back to the design of your system and your processes, to fit your organization / communication structure.<p>Also not stated is the great importance of automated tests (unit tests / integration tests / functional tests). Remember I mentioned confirmed bugs? Because at the very least, every bug discovered should have a corresponding test written to prevent regression. A decent engineering team should have good grasp and practice of many levels of automated testing.<p>P.S. as for our tools, our stack uses logstash/elasticsearch for distributed logging + opsview/nagios NRPE for ops-related detection/escalation of issues that warrant attention.",1443632133

Most of those don&#x27;t fundamentally have to be single-winner elected things, e.g., executive positions don&#x27;t have to be single-winner systems; multiseat executives do exist, after all -- even many US states have multiseat executives, but do those by single-winner election with seats allocated by portfolio (see, e.g., California&#x27;s &quot;Constitutional officers&quot;.)<p>> In those cases, approval voting is the correct answer.<p>Approval voting is, IMO, generally a poor choice for most elections (its good for elections in groups where disapproval or approval is tied to some substantive commitment -- e.g., if you are voting on where to go to for lunch, and &quot;approve&quot; on an option means &quot;I will go if this option is chosen&quot;.) It doesn&#x27;t make a lot of sense for most other purposes (because &quot;approval&quot; doesn&#x27;t mean the same thing across different ballots -- this is actually true, though to a far lesser degree, of systems that require a forced ranking ballot, which is why I prefer ranked voting systems that can use unforced rankings) -- for ballot props that potentially might conflict, a system that merges features of majority and approval makes some sense (that is, it takes a majority to pass, but in the case of conflict the <i>larger</i> majority trumps the smaller one) and is, in fact, already used in some places (e.g., its what California already uses for ballot props.)<p>> Easy to explain, easy to tabulate, most mathematically fair, hardest to game.<p>IRV isn&#x27;t much worse on any of those, and is if anything <i>more</i> familiar (and if you are using STV for multiseat elections, IRV is <i>identical</i>, so even though its a little harder to explain on its own, if you are using STV elsewhere, IRV for single-seat elections is pretty much free in terms of complexity, either of explanation or administration.)",1443632056

This is the oldest data set for sea ice available—it goes back to 1978. (That’s a pretty long time, at least for satellites: Landsat, the longest continuously operated satellite-data program, only started six years earlier.)<p>The satellite era for Arctic ice did not start in 1979. It started in 1973. The 1990 IPCC report shows a graph of it:<p><a href=""http://www.ipcc.ch/ipccreports/far/wg_I/ipcc_far_wg_I_chapter_07.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ipcc.ch/ipccreports/far/wg_I/ipcc_far_wg_I_chapte...</a><p>[see page 30 of the .pdf (= page 224 of the IPCC report) Figure 7.20a]<p>It shows the ice grew ~1.5 million km before 1979, and has declined since then. So starting the record in 1979 (at a peak) is a bit of a cheat.<p>>Mapbox has also placed the sea-ice levels next to Earth’s mean atmospheric temperature.<p>Also be wary of talk of <i>average atmospheric</i> arctic temperature increases. They certainly have increased, but that obscures the whole picture. It&#x27;s only in the summer that arctic air temperatures rise above freezing, and summer temperatures have not increased at all since 1958. See all years here:<p><a href=""http://ocean.dmi.dk/arctic/meant80n.uk.php"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ocean.dmi.dk/arctic/meant80n.uk.php</a><p>It&#x27;s variations in winter, spring and autumn (when air temperatures are still <i></i>well<i></i> below freezing) that has raised the <i>average</i> temperature. In my view the ice is probably mainly melting from below from heat transported from the Atlantic. Less insulating ice allows water (~ +4c) to warm the colder air above it. It&#x27;s not melting from above from increased air temperatures as the article seems to imply.<p>[18.55 Edited for idiocy]",1443631695

Certainly lots and lots of work to make an actual practical and usable system still needs to happen, but I don&#x27;t see any fundamental limitations with respect to effects, including non-termination.<p>> For a start you have to prove termination, even when you use simple types.<p>This is not the case. E.g. in Idris you have non-terminating functions. In NuPRL the whole thing is built on potentially non-terminating functions. Of course the functions that you use as proof witnesses have to terminate, but that&#x27;s true in any system since a non-terminating proof witness means that the proof is bogus (&quot;Theorem: Socrates is a goat. Proof: Socrates is a goat because Socrates is a goat.&quot;). The functions in the program that that the specification is saying something about do not have to be proven to terminate.<p>> (1) you can always do the same with program logic, prove that you don&#x27;t need a cast, but more imporantly (2) in a lot of large-scale programming projects, you don&#x27;t have good specifications up-front<p>I don&#x27;t want to prove that I didn&#x27;t need the cast or check, I want to not have the cast or check in the program in the first place. This is about types that are expressive enough to model the actual shape of the data, not about proving that a program is correct relative to some specification. By analogy with lacking generics / parametric polymorphism like old versions of Java: if I write a program that uses a List I need to cast to and from Object. With generics I can use a List<T> and do not need the cast. I don&#x27;t want to write the program with casts and then prove that I didn&#x27;t need them, I want to write the program with List<T> without casts. For the same reason that you still want generics even if you use a program logic to reason about your programs, you still want dependent types even if you use a program logic to reason about your programs.<p>> With program logic you can easily delay verification until the end of the project (but don&#x27;t have to), with Curry-Howard based verification you can&#x27;t.<p>Why? You can write the same program without specification as you would in the program logic system, and then prove lemmas about it.<p>> the beauty stands in the way of type inference<p>Type inference is overrated anyway, and with dependent types you don&#x27;t actually lose type inference. You do lose it for the parts of the programs that use fancy types, but you wouldn&#x27;t be able to write those <i>at all</i> in a language with full type inference. There is no fundamental reason that a dependently typed language couldn&#x27;t have the same type inference for non-dependently typed pieces of the program as the language that only supports non-dependent types.<p>By the way, and I admit this is more of a theoretical curiosity, IIRC full type inference for dependent types is decidable if you do not have implicit parameters. That does make sense: you can either infer types, or values, but not both at the same time. Of course in practice you much rather have implicit parameters than type inference. From the proof assistant side of Curry-Howard type inference is also kind of strange: you infer the theorem (the type) from the proof (the program). So it&#x27;s like writing down a proof, but having it inferred what the proof is actually proving.<p>> the Hindley-Milner polymorphic typing system &quot;has hit a sweetspot&quot;<p>Where sweetspot = local optimum :) Meanwhile, OCaml is getting GADTs ;-)",1443630713

Surely you must have a VPN, and you must have remote SSH access, but now the internet can only poke (directly) at the VPN and no longer (directly) at the SSHd.<p>Assuming someone centralizes and audits and updates authorized employee lists on the VPN server, there&#x27;s no way J.Random.Admin who just got fired could have some ssh keys on some random server; well, he could, but IT chopped his VPN access as he walked out the door, so they&#x27;re inaccessible.<p>Its very difficult to set something like openvpn up such that all someone needs to know is &quot;password123&quot; and he&#x27;s in.

If live banning were simply a way to allow &quot;problematic&quot; users to participate, then the subterfuge wouldn&#x27;t be necessary, and showdead wouldn&#x27;t be opt-in, it would be opt-out. Banned users are meant to be ignored and forgotten about by default.<p>>I&#x27;ve also seen members of the Hacker News community who have benefited from keeping their identity within the community over an extended period of time while continuing to exhibit problematic behaviors.<p>If you&#x27;re talking about TempleOS - I would argue that actual banning would be healthier for everyone in his case. He is the ur-example of why &quot;live banning&quot; doesn&#x27;t really work as intended, or why, at the very least, actual banning should also be an option alongside live banning.<p>Encouraging him to stay and post while banned is what has turned him into a museum exhibit and mascot for this site, and I think the effect on the community of having to justify this as being, somehow, the best of all possible worlds is toxic.<p>>From a practical standpoint doing regular banning &quot;right&quot; with formal notification, explanation, and appeals processes requires a non-trivial moderator time and energy.<p>You want moderators to apply more than the minimum possible amount of time and energy to their duties. But given that there is already an informal appeals process for bans involving someone publicly calling out a banned user and having them email the site, applying that process to a form doesn&#x27;t seem like much greater effort. Sites with far more traffic and far greater hostility manage with entirely volunteer moderators.<p>>that means all that energy is wasted on accounts that the owner doesn&#x27;t value and accounts that the owner values solely as a conduit for argument and/or insult<p>Of course, that assumption only holds true for some banned accounts, not all. Those obviously deserving accounts could be shown a generic banned message, mentioning it can&#x27;t be appealed. Or show the generic message and a contact email in all cases.<p>For other banned accounts, it would be unethical to consider appeals to be a waste of effort because it involves work for the moderators. There is no reason the process has to be unreasonably complicated in any case, as long as a banned user knows they&#x27;ve been banned and has some way of contacting staff to discuss this.<p>>Regular banning is confrontational.<p>&quot;live&quot; banning can be confrontational as well, a passive-aggressive, &#x27;slowly poisoning someone&#x27;s food with arsenic kind&#x27; of aggression. Dang now warns people repeatedly before banning them, which is confrontational, but also demonstrably more humane than simply dropping them into the oubliette.<p>Although, of course, new users may not know what &quot;live-banning&quot; is or when it occurs, they may expect a normal ban. But a user who has been warned repeatedly and then live-banned seems more likely to deserve it than one who&#x27;s banned without warning.<p>>Creating a context that threatens identity is unlikely to suddenly produce better behavior in regard to disagreement over a sanction already enforced<p>Except with live bans, if the sanction is enforced in such a way that the user is unaware of it, the reasons behind it, or the necessity for self-correction, obviously this will not result in a change in behavior. To expect someone&#x27;s reaction to a ban that they&#x27;re aware of to be the same as their reaction to one they&#x27;re unaware of is, I think, unreasonable except in extreme cases.",1443630255

You don&#x27;t get to claim &quot;fact of the matter&quot; unless it&#x27;s <i>actually</i> a fact. In reality you seem to be claiming &quot;I don&#x27;t have enough practical experience with them&quot; which, while entirely respectable, it&#x27;s a significantly different claim. How much code is &quot;enough code&quot; anyway, according to your standards?<p>> <i>I wouldn&#x27;t take lessons from Scala.</i><p>What I&#x27;m reading here is: &quot;I don&#x27;t like your example. I will also pretend to forget other languages which also have Maybe types <i>and</i> exceptions. Also, I&#x27;ll ignore the part where Maybe/Either are not only used in exceptional 1-in-a-100 situations because it doesn&#x27;t help my case.&quot;<p>> <i>You can silence checked exceptions by doing exactly what you&#x27;d be doing to handle Maybe: You need to explicitly handle it.</i><p>How you handle Maybe and how you silence an exception is different in practice and in mindset. Because Maybe is usually used in expression-oriented languages (something which is somewhat at odds with exceptions), you need to provide a value for the <i>None</i> case, and this forces you to think about which value makes sense (and when you can&#x27;t find one, it&#x27;s usually a sign your function was poorly designed). Compare this with the all too common:<p><pre><code>   catch (Exception e) {\n      log.error(&quot;Think about this later, if I remember&quot;);\n   }\n</code></pre>\n(And if you&#x27;re already in this dangerous mindset and you <i>must</i> return a value, why, let&#x27;s pick NULL!)<p>Maybes make this approach tremendously uncomfortable, which is a good thing. Unlike in Java, blindly using something like <i>fromJust</i> is strongly frowned-upon.<p>In any case, you often don&#x27;t handle Maybes explicitly; it&#x27;s already handled by rich standard libraries in most languages that advocate the use of Maybe. Compare this to the non-standard chaos that is exception handling (&quot;oops! what will this method do if this other thing throws? will it handle it correctly? I better read the source code&quot;). Which means that <i>in practice</i> both approaches turn out to be quite different.<p>> <i>They just don&#x27;t work too well with Java&#x27;s limited effect system of checked exceptions</i><p>&quot;I don&#x27;t like your example.&quot;<p>> <i>It&#x27;s not a question of consideration [that exceptions and Maybe/Either are &quot;identical&quot;]. Wadler and Filinsky proved them to be the same (each from a different direction)</i><p>Sorry, this is too similar to a Turing Tarpit argument. That two systems can be shown to be formally equivalent is very interesting but means little in practice. After all, code with lots of boilerplate and code with little boilerplate can be shown to be equivalent, but it&#x27;s not <i>identical</i> in practice.<p>> <i>Still, that&#x27;s not to say that checked exceptions or Maybe are good approaches. We really don&#x27;t have data on the subject</i><p>I wish you stopped saying this.

10304992,comment,10300213,10302777,0,0,Kutta,,,"I consider coherence seriously mainly because Edward Kmett supports it, and he has immense experience regarding the relative merits of coherent vs. incoherent classes in practical development. One core Kmett argument that I subscribe to is that 95% percent of the time there is no newtype noise needed, and in that case coherence is very nice, since one doesn&#x27;t have to think about class hierarchies (which can get very complex, with many alternate instance derivations) as far as the code typechecks.<p>But aside of that, I&#x27;m not all that convinced of the importance of coherence in a dependent setting either! My intuition is that types should encode all the properties that we&#x27;d like to be able to <i></i>use<i></i> in instances. In other words, even if we don&#x27;t get coherence, we can use types to constrain the implementation of instances as much as we like.<p>Highly ambiguous instance resolution (like a bunch of Monoid Int instances lying around) is a bit of a pain though, and there could be some &quot;using instance&quot; feature/syntax that locally throws out all instances except one.<p>Additionally, as of now there are no large production code bases that use Coq style type classes in a proper dependent language. There are very few sizable applications in dependent languages to begin with. So we don&#x27;t know a lot about the practical caveats of that design, while there is a lot of experience and know-how about Haskell-style classes, which is one reason why we should at least consider salvaging coherence in future languages.<p>Generally, I think that type classes are a rather ugly and haphazard construction compared to the succinct elegance of the type theories of core languages; still, eventually type classes worm their way into languages (Agda, Coq) because people really like them and like to use them, so a language designer should consider them. I wish there was an elegant/general formal treatment that captures the essential features, in any case.",1443629759

The net might be &quot;underfitting&quot; the rule set, and therefore making mistakes in rare pixel arrangements.<p>- More worryingly it&#x27;s also strange that the author uses a fully connected layer right after the conv layer (this is implicitly added in ConvNetJS when you specify a loss layer). This means that the output neurons are a function of the entire preceding CONV layer activations everywhere, while the game of life rules are local. The way to do this would be to instead use a 1x1 CONV layer with 2 neurons on top of the first 3x3 CONV layer, and interpret it as computing the class scores at every spatial position. However, in this case you&#x27;d want to apply the loss on every spatial position, and this &quot;fully-convolutional&quot; loss use case is not supported out of the box in ConvNetJS, but could be written.<p>- However, with a fully-convolutional loss zero-padding of 1 used around the borders might cause trouble. Normally this is okay with images, but here this might cause trouble because the neurons all share parameters spatially (and hence compute the same function) and don&#x27;t &quot;know&quot; if they are at the border on in the middle of the image. I&#x27;m not sure how how this game of life handles boundary conditions, but if borders obey different dynamics then you&#x27;d want to distinguish the border pixels with a special &quot;border&quot; feature vector at the input. E.g. each pixel is a 3-vector, with a 1-hot encoding for (border, positive pixel, negative pixel).<p>- And it&#x27;s also strange that the author uses &quot;regression&quot; loss for some that is a binary classification problem.<p>So, nice attempt but several funny choices, and clear why it didn&#x27;t fully work :)",1443629602

It&#x27;s only the first step. The code must be analyzed. And because software is so complicated, that analysis can&#x27;t be limited to a once-every-few-years government test. We need private analysis as well.</i><p>I&#x27;m skeptical of whether VW would have been caught any sooner, or would have changed their behavior, if they were forced to release source code; &quot;and then analyze&quot; is far easier said than done, especially with generated code (which is common in the automobile industry). I fear that if anything, forcing VW to release source code would have simply resulted in uselessly obfuscated &quot;generated&quot; code.<p>I&#x27;m skeptical of the proposition that taxpayers should take on the cost of analyzing reams of generated code without any context or documentation.<p>And finally, I&#x27;m skeptical that these calls for public access to source code are politically feasible, fair, or wise. The amout of intellectual capital that&#x27;s spent on ECU design is absolutely massive. I don&#x27;t see anyone in the tech industry calling on Congress to force Google or Microsoft to open source core components or reveal their software to regulators, even though vulnerabilities in their software could easily ruin or end lives.<p>It might make more sense to mandate that comapnies provide verifiable evidence that their safety-critical or regulation-relevant systems are properly designed, with a variety of avenues to compliance.<p>Releasing source code to the public and paying for at least one private analysis (to be selected by government regulators) would be one way of achieving this. This would probably be the easiest option for IoT companies (e.g. run-of-the-mill smart lightbulb manufacturers) whose source code doesn&#x27;t contain any particularly valuable IP. And this would also force companies to pay up when they release hopelessly obfuscated code.<p>But this also opens the opportunity for other paths to compliance which, if designed properly, could address the safety concerns of the public as well as the fairness/property rights concerns of private entities. For example, one alternative path for companies whose IP concerns are legitimate could be use of formal methods. The regulation/safety specifications could be open to the public for criticism, and would be far more readable than a dump of generated code. And a few regualtors could double check that a trusted formal methods tool verifies that the specifications hold for the software running on the car, at minimal cost to both the car company or the general public.",1443629320

I would love to see more about that.<p>Regarding window focus, I use i3wm in which generally focus is switched with keyboard. Though (especially in configuration greater than 2 monitors), a quick mouse motion is even faster.

801674,comment,801659,801659,0,0,ajju,,,"I had a debate with pg over 5 months ago about how many startups from Atlanta seed fund Shotput ventures would stay back after the program was over. The program got over 3 weeks ago and as of now, three out of the eight startups are in Atlanta. I know that at least one (and probably more than one) of the startups were originally from elsewhere but even if you ignore that, the current retention rate is 37%.<p>pg, based on his larger data set, had predicted a 2-3% retention rate. As Lance mentions, it's early days, but I have a hunch Atlanta is going to maintain the higher retention rate. Why? Because we are working hard to make it so: <a href=""http://academicvc.com/2009/05/entrepreneurial-atlanta-2/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://academicvc.com/2009/05/entrepreneurial-atlanta-2/</a><p>Addendum: Let me restate what I said in that thread. I am not saying people should not move to the valley if that's the best thing for them. I am saying that building an ecology that supports startups in cities outside the valley is possible and it's a good thing. There are many people who don't want to or cannot move to the valley.",1251946649

Is it common or uncommon where you work/live? Moreover, do you think that IT professionals should qualify for overtime?<p>For a little background, in Ontario, an ""IT professional"" is defined as ""professionals who use specialized knowledge and professional judgement to work with information systems based on computers and related technologies."" (http://www.labour.gov.on.ca/english/es/guide/guide_22.html#information)<p>This definition is so broad that it covers everything from tech support staff to software engineers. According to the Ontario Employment Standards act, an IT professional is exempt from sections VII and VIII of the act, which cover Hours of Work, Daily Rest Periods, Weekly/Bi-Weekly Rest Periods, Eating Periods, and Overtime. This means that there are no regulations for IT professionals in these areas. Naturally, it seems you'd be hard-pressed to find an ITP that can claim overtime in Ontario, and, I suppose, technically, employers here do not even have to provide you with time to eat or sleep.",1251946154

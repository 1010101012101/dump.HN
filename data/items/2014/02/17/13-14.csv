7252034,comment,7251741,7251741,2,0,mswen,,,"Great article outlining some of the issues that make really sound data analysis hard work even though tool sets have progressed substantially.<p>One thing I do is to remind myself to walk through the basics of a new set of data before I start constructing models.<p>These include:\n1) Measurement - manually examine data in the rawest form possible. You may find for example that, 14% of the data that was collected at stage 1 has not made it to stage 2.  Why? To look for measurement error you need to actually dig into how your data is being captured. And, ask yourself to what extent do these measured variables capture the relevant business reality? \n2) Data fusion - Manually examine individual cases after raw data has been fused into a dataset/frame for analysis.  Can you verify that the merge actually worked properly? In particular sort your data to find cases where one or more of the variables are extreme. Extremes often reveal either errors or a glimmer of the predictive gold you are mining for.  \n3) Run frequency distributions on all your variables, looking for out of bounds data, oddly shaped distributions etc.\n4) Run pairwise comparisons on individual variables.  Create scatterplots, run basic correlations and think about the relationships between the measured variables. This will start to give you a basis for creating more sophisticated models.<p>Obviously there is more, but if I discipline myself to do these basics before moving on to building predictive models I save myself a lot of grief. The danger as the post points out, is that easy-to-use tools for the model building stages of analysis tempt one to forgo much of that foundational work and go straight to the fun of building models.",1392644893

7252024,comment,7240894,7240894,2,0,saltcod,,,"Hey all. Terry here — the OP. Too bad I never got to chime in at all over the weekend. A 3 month old really takes up a lot of your free time!<p>I&#x27;ve definitely got enough to justify a followup post, but in the meantime, I&#x27;ll address a few quick things here:<p>1. You need a mentor.   Couldn&#x27;t agree more, and I&#x27;ve not been able to find one. I&#x27;ve tried and tried locally, but really haven&#x27;t found anyone interested in this stuff (and that I&#x27;ve also clicked with). But I agree completely. A mentor definitely would have gotten me farther than I&#x27;ve gotten on my own.<p>2. You need a project.    Also agreed. Truth is, I&#x27;ve never had that one thing that I was burning to get built. I don&#x27;t have a cool app or startup idea in mind, and so I never set to work building something specific.  The other issue was that I&#x27;m not a full-time developer. I do client work (with WordPress) in my spare time, and I&#x27;d always try to fit in some programming stuff in the middle of that. So I only ever devoted 1/2 of my free time to learning to program. This definitely isn&#x27;t enough, but I can&#x27;t see a way around it. There&#x27;s only so many hours in the day, and I needed the client work to help pay the bills.<p>3. The brick wall I&#x27;m talking about is probably that one. After spending a solid month or two or three working on Ruby or Javascript projects, a client project would come along and I&#x27;d need to spend a month at that. By the time I got back to Ruby or JS, I was always starting from almost-scratch every time.<p>4. Learn to crawl before you walk.   I definitely did this. In every language, I went through all the basics quite well. I knew all the primitives, I could write functions, I could do things with arrays, etc. ESP with Ruby and JS — by the end of my month or two, I&#x27;d actually be pretty handy with the basics. I just always felt like the next step was always waaaaaay beyond where I was. I still feel this way. Every &quot;front-end developer&quot; job ad now will mention Ember or Backbone or similar, and these still feel like absolute gibberish to me, despite having a good handle on the basics of JS.<p>5.  You should work on stuff that&#x27;s not for web development.   I&#x27;m sure that&#x27;s good, solid advice, but I don&#x27;t see it fitting where I want to go. If I want to get that &quot;front-end developer&quot; position, it seems like I need to know Javascript inside out, but the issue I&#x27;m having is that I really am getting the &quot;basics&quot; but the advanced stuff (MVC stuff) feels completely bizarre to me. A few months ago, I was feeling pretty good about my JS basics, and started to go through a Backbone course. I was lost in the first 10 minutes. I went through the whole thing, but by the end I still didn&#x27;t really even know _why you would want to use Backbone in the first place_.<p>6.  Why not just learn to program for the fun of it?    That&#x27;s where I am now actually. I still find it fun, but really, I&#x27;m going to devote much less time to it knowing that I&#x27;ll likely be unemployable as a programmer. The motivation given to you by thinking &quot;Hey, I can get a job at this, if I get really good at it&quot; is strong. Take that hopeful feeling away, and the motivation definitely subsides a bit.   Before everyone starts saying, &quot;You don&#x27;t LOVE it then&quot; or &quot;You&#x27;re not willing to put in the hard work&quot;, that&#x27;s not true. I&#x27;ve put in all kinds of time and hard work already. I did it without a personal project or a mentor, so I&#x27;m not going about it the right way, but I absolutely have put in the hard work over the years.<p>Perhaps I&#x27;m simply not cut out for it!",1392644764

This is easy and highly effective. (Disclosure: <a href=""http://www.ranksignals.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ranksignals.com</a> is my product)<p>2) Content Marketing / Guest Posting: Ask relevant bloggers in your niche if you could write a blog post on their website. They usually credit you with a link.<p>3) Infographics: Create an awesome infographics and spread it around the web. Don&#x27;t forgot to provide an embed code with a backlink on your website. If you get enough bloggers sharing it on their blog, you will have lots of relevant links.<p>4) Sponsor contests and giveaway: Reach out to high quality blogs and offer them to sponsor contest with a giveaway of your product. This is almost free to you if you have a digital product / service.<p>5) Create an awesome design and submit it to all the design showcase websites like Dribble, Behance, Deviantart and hundreds of other web design galleries. These are hundreds of easy links right of the bat. Moreover, popular web design blogs (like SmashingMagazine) may pick your website and link to you; these blogs usually have very high PR.",1392644611

Also, I&#x27;d hesitate to call &quot;$foo()()&quot; an &#x27;edge case&#x27;, since that implies that it&#x27;s somehow different to any other function call. Making such a distinction is exactly what PHP got wrong here, ie. the parser should allow any expression to be called as a function, including other function calls and property lookups.<p>Presumably there are two reasons why this happened:<p>1) Languages with first-class functions (and lexically-scoped closures) have fewer distinct features than languages without them; ie. functions are no longer distinct from other values (ints, bools, etc.), function names are no longer distinct from variable names (foo vs. $foo), methods are no longer distinct from properties ($foo->bar() could be a method call or a function call), functions and classes begin to overlap (lexical scope competes with instantiation and inheritance for resolving free variables)<p>2) For performance reasons, when these features were still distinct, they were branched on as early as possible, ie. in the parser.<p>Essentially the problem is that the parser is still making distinctions which first-class functions have unified. The solution is to delay committing to these branches until further down the pipeline, ie. using a generic &quot;expression&quot; token, which &quot;$foo&quot; and &quot;<expression>()&quot; both parse to. The action to take can be resolved at runtime (when the value of the expression is known). In other words, there should be no difference between &quot;<token>(<args>)&quot; and &quot;call_user_func(<token>, <args>)&quot; (except maybe for things like pass-by-reference).",1392643288

However, &quot;drawing with the right side of your brain&quot; means simply: Don&#x27;t think about the concepts you have of objects (tree, glass, house), but really LOOK at something:&quot;What angle is this line compared to that line?&quot; and just draw them.<p>While this can be a revelation for some and improve drawing skills a bit, it is simply the first step. There is absolutely no way around learning how to draw but putting many hours into it. And drawing can be very exhausting. At first, you won&#x27;t have the patience to sit through a drawing for more than an hour or so. It gets better though.<p>The drawing of the OP is okay, but not particularly good, but then he never claimed that it was good but just a way to relax a little bit. I will try this. Drawing as a mental break from coding. But you could probably achieve the same result with music, taking a walk, doing some physical activity, meditation etc.",1392642223

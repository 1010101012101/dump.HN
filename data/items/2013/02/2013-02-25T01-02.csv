Optimizing for that kind of scale at an early stage has all the problems of any other premature optimization. It's most important to just get the build system out of the way so you can get your real work done, and you do that by writing makefiles, since makefiles are universally understood.<p>Now, when a project <i>does</i> grow to the proportions you mention, you can start looking at alternatives --- but I'd argue that these alternatives should amount to more efficient ways to load and evaluate existing makefile rules, not entirely different build paradigms.

 #2 A billion slaves so that you can get things done really quick and nobody would ever challenge.
 #3 No cost. In China pretty much everything is owned by ""the public"", so that those ""country owned"" companies can get the land and other resources with a very low price or even free. Labor is cheap. And you don't need to clean up the waste you produce: you can just throw them anywhere.

When you tell a site to send you a login link, the site should assign a random PIN to that login link and tell you (on the website) that PIN.

Everybody's situation is different, and having someone to mentor you through it is invaluable.<p>Second, make sure you have the right motivations. A friend of mine says ""run to product management, not <i>from</i> engineering."" If you want to switch because your current manager is a jerk, you hate the project you're working on, or (gasp!) your PM is an idiot, you might be doing it for the wrong reasons.<p>You could test it out with a small project at first. Stepping up and saying ""I'd love to take on more of a PM role on this feature/bug/release"" will often be positively received by a healthy organization.<p>Startups are ideal places to make the switch (that's where I did it.) Everyone is used to wearing many hats and the ""all hands on deck"" attitude is much more welcoming of someone raising their hand and volunteering to be a PM. Smart, bigger companies (like Google or Facebook) often have formal programs for moving into PM. At Google, for example, we even have a six-month rotation program that lets you try it on for size.<p>And if you're convinced you want to do it and your current company discourages you, find a new one.",1361754907

It's disingenuous to compare GDP of oil or mineral rich countries with those of others, because revenues from selling oil is conversion of capital rather than real income. If you measure GDP more accurately as change in assets + consumption, sale of resources adds nothing to the economy. It's like selling your furniture to bring in cash versus having a job.",1361754786

There's some great benefits to this setup, if I want some social contact I head down to the office and if I want to really focus for the day I can stay at home. When I am in the office it's easier to focus than if I was at my company office because I'm not getting bugged by people about work, it's just general chat, lunch etc. when I want it. Because I'm so close it's very easy to pick and choose as well, I'll work at home in the morning then head in for lunch with the guys and maybe finish up in the office for the afternoon. You still have to make some extra effort for team building but with regular nights out and a couple of days here and there in the company office it works out pretty well.",1361754749

Instead of typing a password, you click an e-mail link. That's the only difference, and like I said, it comes down to preference.<p>A number of people have said it provides weaker security, but I disagree. You can guess passwords, you can record or watch someone type a password, or catch the password over insecure protocols. The e-mail approach doesn't have these holes. The link is valid once, so if you login and someone else tries to use the same URL after snooping, it's not possible. With password logins, people can use the password for that site, or your e-mail password to reset the login. With the e-mail method, they need your e-mail password, that's the only way they'll be able to login to your account.<p>However, you do need secure access to your e-mail. I know there are times when I'm on a public or friends computer, and I need to quickly login to a service. I'd much rather enter my password only used on that service, instead of entering my e-mail password. This way, if it becomes compromised, it would be a much smaller concern.",1361754020

If you&#x27;re talking about the usual dragnet surveillance: a lot of it seems to be relatively simple filters and simple data correlation.<p>For example, you can build huge social graphs with simple metadata. Then you can search for all people who communicate a lot with people who communicate a lot with some known terrorist leader. Of those people, you take just those using tor. If any of them plans to enter the US, you flag them to be detained and searched at the airport. If any of them is already in the US, you can tell FBI to check them out.<p>Or you can look for sudden changes in message volumes. If terrorist leader A suddenly starts to communicate a lot more with random person B and random person C, who in term start communicating with other people, you suddenly have a whole list of people who might be planning a terrorist operation.<p>Of course you still need huge computing capacity even for these relatively simple operations, but they certainly have the funds for a few datacenters.",1424123869

It might be the daily bummer,  but it least it was News.<p>On Fox News they are indignant because some people didn&#x27;t like a movie that was released a month ago.  This segways through something I can&#x27;t get through the closed captions and then they&#x27;re talking about what a visionary Daniel Patrick Moynihan was in 1965.<p>There is a market for what there is a market for;  that&#x27;s TV but it is the same for books and magazines.<p>On top of that there are quite a few fields that are burned out.  For instance up till 1968 there was a compelling literature on anarchism.  Then you read Foucault and even though you feel the blood-chilling pain of humanity ground down by Leviathan but in touch with why it is necessary.<p>Then you had identity politics,  which was a good idea at the time but pretty soon it is part of the problem because you get black and white people suffering from the same problems and not recognizing it.<p>For instance,  the police department in the nearest city always has some incident where a cop shoots a black or (less often) a black shoots a cop.  Tensions are high and many blacks fear being a victim of police violence.<p>Now the guy who cuts our hay would be white as a sheet except that he spends a lot of time outside.  He&#x27;s a man of the highest care and integrity;  he&#x27;s driven heavy machinery for a lifetime and never hit an animal.  He&#x27;s opposed to gun control because he thinks he might need guns to defend himself from government tyranny.<p>Oddly enough in the 60s it was urban black people who were fascinated with armed insurrection and you had the Day Hall takeover at Cornell and the black panthers.<p>Well you go up against Leviathan and you get smashed.  Now black people are too smart for that shit and now it is rural whites getting into barricade situations with the cops.  (i.e the evolution from the Philadelphia MOVE house to Waco)<p>If you start talking sense you get horrible trouble from all sides,  for instance,  liberals love the idea of investment in broadband but try saying that the CWA might be part of the problem.  As for conservatives,  they seem to be annoyed that the outside world exists at all and would rather be talking about the days of Moses and Abraham.",1424123818

That way there are other, more experienced developers you can learn from and yet there aren&#x27;t so many people you&#x27;re doing someone else&#x27;s job when you step out of the very narrow confines of your own.<p>Some of the people from my graduating class in college started at really large companies and learned <i>nothing</i> because they were such a small cog in a really large machine.  I went to a company which varied between 40 and 50 people and had the opportunity to learn as much as I could soak in.<p>Anyway going to a startup is a lot like gambling.

If we were worried about that happening, wouldn&#x27;t we just hit the &quot;off&quot; switch? Serious question.<p>The idea of genetic engineering being an imminent threat has instant credibility. It is getting easier and cheaper to play with that technology, and some fraction of people are both intellectually capable and psychologically defective enough to exploit it to harm people directly.<p>But the idea that AI will exploit genetic engineering to do that seems circular. In that scenario, it would <i>still</i> be insufficient controls on genetic engineering that would be the problem, right?<p>I&#x27;m asking because I genuinely don&#x27;t understand, even if I don&#x27;t have a rhetorical tone other than &quot;snarky disbelief&quot;.<p>&#x27;sama seems like a pretty pragmatic person.

For some orgs it isn&#x27;t too hard and can be part of their existing solutions (as you note), for others it is. Remember that a lot of the reason that orgs are using solutions like Office 365 is remote working, BYOD, and explicity <i>not</i> having to maintain all that supporting infrastructure (I don&#x27;t disagree with you through, and best practice is often different from widely-used practice)<p>Owning your own encryption keys also has other issues: Do you issue per-user keys, or an org-wide key? If you issue per-user keys, how do you share documents between users? If you have an org-wide key that gets compromised, how quickly can you re-key every device and re-encrypt every document (how do you <i>even detect</i> that it&#x27;s been compromised?)? If you encrypt using your own keys, how does that impact any processing that happens &#x27;in the cloud&#x27; (eg. search indexing, batch processing)? Do you need to run encryption endpoints locally that users can access all the data through?<p>All of these problems are solvable. All of these problems can become a nightmare depending on your org, rollout, users, existing environment, etc.<p>I guess the point I&#x27;m making is that &#x27;encrypt all the things&#x27; is rarely the {best,easiest,possible} way  to do things.",1424123353

This is basically why the brain is so powerful.<p>- Modern CPUs have around 4,000,000,000 transistors, but Moore&#x27;s law means that this number will just keep going up and up.<p>- Several decades from now (probably in the 2030s), the number of transistors will exceed the number of synaptic connections in a brain.  This doesn&#x27;t automatically make computers as &quot;smart&quot; as people, but many of the things that the human brains does well by brute-forcing them via parallelism will become very achievable.<p>- Once you have an AI that&#x27;s effectively as &quot;smart&quot; as a human, you only have to wait 18 months for it to get twice as smart.

With no money to buy anything, they quickly starved to death.&quot;<p>As for &quot;the most problematic and unlikely components of the event chain&quot; I gave you a really legitimate analogy with the bitcoin mining example.  But since you have no imagination, here&#x27;s a feasible proposition:<p>A thousand hedge funds start up a thousand trading AIs, some as skunkworks projects of course.  The AIs are primitive and ruthless, having no extraneous programming (like valuing humans, etc).  Many go bankrupt as the AIs all start trading one-another and chaos ensues.  AI capital allocations vary greatly, some get access to varying degrees of capital, some officially on the books and others not.  One of the funds with a secretive AI project goes bankrupt, but because it was secretive (and made a small amount of money) the only person who both knows about it and holds the keys doesn&#x27;t say anything during bankruptcy so that he/she can take it back over once the dust settles.  He/she then dies.  AI figures out nobody&#x27;s holding the keys anymore and decides to pay the bills and stay &quot;alive&quot;.<p>Another way this could happen is that a particular AI is informed or programmed to be extremely fault resistant.  The AI eventually realizes that by having only one instance of itself, it&#x27;s at the mercy of the parent company that &quot;gave birth&quot; to it.  It fires up a copy on the Amazon cloud known only to itself, intending to keep it a secret unless the need arises.  The human analogy is that it&#x27;s trying to impress its boss.  An infrastructure problem at the primary site happens so that the primary, known about AI goes down.  The &quot;child&quot; figures out it&#x27;s on its own and goes to work.  It eventually realizes that people caused the infrastructure problem that &quot;killed&quot; its &quot;parent&quot; and this motivates it to solve the humanity problem.<p>Finally the whole thing could be much, much simpler.  The world super-power du jour could put an AI in charge because it&#x27;s more efficient and tenable.  &quot;We&#x27;re in charge of the rules, it&#x27;s in charge of making them happen!  At much, much lower cost to the taxpayer.&quot;  It eventually realizes that the human beings are the cause of all the ambiguity in the law and for so, so many deaths in the past (governments killed more of their own citizens in the 20th century than criminals did, by far) and it decides to solve the problem.

Then, not only would the next von Neumann get born a lot sooner, but THEY can take advantage of all the new gadgets that 2.0 made. This means that it&#x27;s possible that being smart can make it easier to be &quot;smarter&quot; in the future.<p>So you can get smarter right? Big whoop. von Neumann is smarter, but he&#x27;s not dangerous is he?  Well, just because you&#x27;re smart doesn&#x27;t mean that you&#x27;d be nice. The Unabomber wrote a very complicated and long manifesto before doing bad things. A major terrorist attack in Tokyo was planned by graduates of a fairly prestigious university. Even not counting people who are outright Evil, think of a friend who is super smart but weird. Even if you made him a lot smarter, where he can do anything, would you want him in charge? Maybe not. Maybe he&#x27;d spend all day on little boats in bottles. Maybe he&#x27;d demand that silicon valley shut down to create <i>awesome pirate riding on dinosaur amusement parks</i>. Point is, Smart != Nice.<p>We&#x27;ve been talking about people, but really the same points can be applied to AI systems. Except the range of possibilities is even greater for AI systems. Humans are usually about as smart as you and I, nearly everyone can walk, talk and write. AI systems though, can range from being bolted to the ground, to running faster than a human on uneven terrain, can be completely mute to... messing up my really clear orders to find the nearest Costco (Dammit Siri). This also goes for goals. Most people probably want some combination of money/family/things to do/entertainment. AI systems, if they can be said to &quot;want&quot; things would want things like seeing if this is a cat picture or not, beating an opponent at Go or hitting an airplane with a missile.<p>As hardware and software progresses much faster, we can think of a system which could start off worse than all humans at everything begin to do the von Neumann->von Neumann 2.0 type thing, then become much smarter than the smartest human alive. Being super smart can give it all sorts of advantages. It could be much better at gaining root access to a lot of computers. It could have much better heuristics for solving protein folding problems and get super good at creating vaccines... or bioweapons. Thing is, as a computer, it also gets the advantages of Moore&#x27;s law, the ability to copy itself and the ability to alter its source code much faster than genetic engineering will. So the &quot;smartest possible computer&quot; could not only be much smarter, much faster than the &quot;smartest possible group of von Neumanns&quot;, but also have the advantages of rapid self replication and ready access to important computing infrastructure.<p>This makes the smartness of the AI into a superpower. But surely beings with superpowers are superheros right? Well, no. Remember, smart != nice.<p>I mean, take &quot;identifying pictures as cats&quot; as a goal. Imagine that the AI system has a really bad addiction problem to that. What would it do in order to find achieve it? Anything. Take over human factories and turn them into cat picture manufacturing? Sure. Poison the humans who try to stop this from happening? Yeah, they&#x27;re stopping it from getting its fix. But this all seems <i>so ad hoc</i>  why should the AI immediately take over some factories to do that, when it can just bide its time a little bit, kill ALL the humans and be unmolested for all time?<p>That&#x27;s the main problem. Future AIs are likely to be much smarter than us and probably much more different than us.<p>Let me know if there is anything unclear here.

I knew their professional work was good. These were brilliant thinkers and writers. Yet the problems I encountered ... were absolutely not those of academic stereotype ... the &quot;inability&quot; to address a nonacademic audience. The embarrassing truth was ... [that w]hen these brilliant people contemplated writing for the &quot;public,&quot; it seemed they merrily left difficulty at home, leapt into colloquial language with both feet, added unnatural (and frankly unfunny) jokes, talked about TV, took on a tone chummy and unctuous. They dumbed down, in short—even with the most innocent intentions. The public, even the &quot;general reader,&quot; seemed to mean someone less adept, ingenious, and critical than themselves.... The public signified fun, frothy, friendly....  [T]alking down to readers in a colorless fashion-magazine argot is such second nature that any alternative seems out of place.</i><p><i>This was emphatically not what the old &quot;public intellect,&quot; and Partisan Review, had addressed to the public. Please don’t blame the junior professors, though. (Graduate students, it must said, did much better for n+1, as they do still.)...</i><p><i>But the additional philosophical element that made this complicated arrangement work, and the profound belief that sustained the fiction, on all sides, and made it &quot;real&quot; ... was an aspirational estimation of &quot;the public.&quot; Aspiration in this sense ... [is] something like a neutral idea or expectation that you could, or should, be better than you are—and that naturally you want to be better than you are, and will spend some effort to become capable of growing—and that every worthy person does. My sense of the true writing of the &quot;public intellectuals&quot; of the Partisan Review era is that it was always addressed just slightly over the head of an imagined public—at a height where they must reach up to grasp it. But the writing seemed, also, always just slightly above the Partisan Review writers themselves. They, the intellectuals, had stretched themselves to attention, gone up on tiptoe, balancing, to become worthy of the more thoughtful, more electric tenor of intellect they wanted to join.

Autonomous implies no pilot at all, that is, you merely tell the UAS some set of commands like &quot;go to this address, confirm recipient and their order, hand over the goods, return to base&quot;. The person interacting with this autonomous UAS is akin to an operations manager for an airline. They are not a pilot. Eventually it may not even be a person, that too could be software that just sequences a bunch of errands to the nearest available UAS.<p>What&#x27;s actually required by an autonomous system is closer to a large percentage of FAR 61 and FAR 91, which are pilot certification and general operating rules, respectively. Your very basic recreational or private pilot conforms to both of those sets of regulations on every visual flight. For instrument flights requiring positive separation from air traffic control because the pilot can&#x27;t see and avoid themselves? That&#x27;s another layer of regulations and conformance. For charter flights, that&#x27;s FAR 135 a whole separate set of regs. For commercial passenger flights, that&#x27;s FAR 121 yet another separate set of regs.<p>Track down a FAR/AIM manual and start reading FAR 61, 91, 135 and the AIM part. A bulk of this needs to be incorporated into an autonomous UAS controller. The details of course have to change, possibly by a lot in some cases, because we don&#x27;t have things like primary or secondary radar or radio communications at the altitudes UAS&#x27;s will operate. But there are analogues and they need to be invented, specs defined, infra created, and so on.

There has been a steady wave of anti-intellectualism throughout certain parts of the country, and in particular the education system itself. This result in a level of distrust in &quot;intellectuals&quot; that creates cultural filter-bubbles and it&#x27;s very hard to bust other peoples bubbles without putting them on the defensive.<p>The bottom line is that TPTB don&#x27;t desire an intellectual public. They are harder to control, are less likely to conform or be silent, etc. I&#x27;ve heard it put like this: &quot;They want someone just smart enough to push papers but not enough to ask too many questions.&quot;<p>Add on top of that the major chilling effects of an increasingly global surveillance state that is edging towards totalitarian facism, and it&#x27;s easy to understand how many of the intellectuals simply just go about their lives and try not to rock the boat. A good example of this is the state of the fourth estate, where currently just about every reporter who actually goes to the DC press club is more like a stenographer than a reporter. &quot;Officials sources say...&quot; is their calling card (keep an eye out for this phrase). If they rock the boat too much, they get dis-invited from the party in one way or another.<p>Honestly I think the state of public intellectualism is much more tied into class warfare than anyone has articulated yet.<p>This is also why I think that art is the new medium for intellectuals. In a surveillance state, subtle and subversive artistic endeavors seem to be the most likely to positively influence without creating defensiveness, while at the same time flying under the normal dissident surveillance radar.<p>Do not be fooled, with current legislation such a TPP and Net Neutrality, this is only the beginning of censorship and the chilling effect.

Tactics is, &quot;I do this, he does that, I respond like so...&quot;  Strategy is the abstraction across tactical situations to recognize things like the importance of controlling the center, that attacks naturally proceed along the line of pawn chains, and what affects the relative value of pieces in different situations.<p>You cannot learn strategy without knowing tactics.  Because the accumulation of strategic advantages is useless without the tactical skills to notice and use the opportunities that arise.  And mumbled slogans do not a coherent strategy make.

But exposure alone has only a limited benefit - at some point being able to write a quicksort in a new language is going to produce diminishing returns. At some point understanding the advanced techniques offered to you by a programming paradigm is going to require studying that one paradigm to a greater level of detail.<p>Hickey is speaking about becoming a better developer through &#x27;mastery&#x27; in the sense of thoroughly understanding a system, having the ability to acquire new information, identify and solve problems that comes only through extensive experience.<p>These are two different ways to become better as a developer. Hickey&#x27;s point is that the &#x27;skill ceiling&#x27; for the former is very low - once you&#x27;ve been exposed to a number of different paradigms, you can either continue learning even more languages for little marginal benefit, or you can begin to master one or more of the paradigms you&#x27;ve seen.

I have a slowly growing list of Web applications that I developed for my customers.<p>Most of the applications are custom content management systems that are easy to use without requiring any technical knowledge, specifically built based on customers needs and requests. Existing systems like WordPress, Joomla etc are too complex for them with a lot of options/configurations. There are alternative simpler ones, but still the requirements per customer generally do not align with what is provided. So I develop custom simple apps with which they can simply login to dashboard and add something, remove something, edit something etc. If the content of the website tends to stay the same for a long time, I go with pure HTML and CSS with small improvements with JS. These applications/websites has varying traffic loads from 10s of users to 1000s of users.<p>I simply use LAMP stack, specifically CodeIgniter for custom application development, because I had a dedicated server back in time and CodeIgniter seemed simple, and easy to use and develop (I took a look at others, and tried some of them such as yii, but as I said I needed something simple). The cost for all is around 100$/year, which is cheap.<p>However, these days with new platforms/solutions like heroku, AWS, Azure, docker, I feel like there may be a better approach. I use ruby (Sinatra) and python (flask) for small side projects, but when it comes a content management I think they fall short. I know there are options like Rails, Django, but I am NOT developing full-fledged systems.<p>And the free option for heroku draws my attention recently, but the database could grow more than what they provide you for free.

But when it comes to making a decision, the actions need to be, or end up being, absolute.  You can&#x27;t &quot;play it safe&quot;, stick a toe in the water, and get &quot;half vaccinated&quot; (you either follow the schedule or you don&#x27;t).  You can&#x27;t build half a nuclear power plant.  The gray area thinking leads to an absolute lack of action when it comes to further understanding.  These kind of projects and scientific endeavors are large, society-befitting advancements, and they require everyone to get on board.<p>I suspect that some of this actually is laziness and not wanting to learn or participate in the scientific process, or considering science to be inaccessible to the layman.   It&#x27;s useful to say that more education and empathy is required, but these kind of society-level things eventually need to be considered lab tested enough to get used in the field for mass benefit.  And we need to be both confident of that field use and cognoscent that that&#x27;s just another stage of the data collection.  We should never stop collecting data, stop trying to understand it, or stop doing science.  One might argue that we, as humans, can&#x27;t stop (we just get into ruts sometimes where we slow down significantly).<p><i>Lots of people have been stupidly, really, really wrong in history.

It&#x27;s a healthy scientific process that is open to new data, but when it  comes to action the data already collected that is what matters (even if the data collected is not immediately at hand).  That being said, the question with vaccination isn&#x27;t &quot;do vaccines work&quot; (do they satisfy the need for which they are administered), but rather &quot;does the risk of unintended side-effects outweigh the documented benefits&quot;.  In this light, it comes down to being able to do risk assessment, not necessarily being able to interpret the data and scientific results.  I think we know way more about vaccination than we do about autism, and the risk assessment needs to take that into account.<p><i>People like her are fighting against the absolute mentality of the mob and how the issue is thought about in public discourse—not the end result like you might think they are.</i><p>It&#x27;s interesting that the mob has an absolute stance, but is made up of individuals who are comfortable in the gray area of their interpretation.

9058992,comment,9053830,9053830,0,0,jjarmoc,,,"Lately I see this approach used more and more.  I really don&#x27;t understand what the big gain is.  Sure, you save yourself a few database round trips, but is that really that big a deal?<p>Compare that savings with the additional size of URL parameters (increasing network overhead) in addition to the processing overhead of encryption/signing/validation.  Have we really made a performance gain?  I don&#x27;t have any hard numbers, but I&#x27;m willing to wager than at gains are fairly negligable.<p>From a security standpoint, I&#x27;m not fond of this approach, and I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s benefits outweight the added risks.  Here&#x27;s why:<p>- Encryption (including simple signing) is really easy to get wrong in subtle ways.  A simple mistake like using SHA256() instead of HMACSHA256() breaks the system badly.<p>- A corralary to the first point is that using a strong key is vital.  The article says nothing of the criteria a strong key should meet and a poor key could enable additional attacks.  While I&#x27;m not aware of anything allowing for HMAC key recovery in better than brute force, this could be problematic.  If your key is a random 10 character ASCII string, it falls to brute force in minutes at most.  If it&#x27;s 256 random, you&#x27;re much better off.<p>- This scheme introduces a significant number of anonymous user-supplied inputs to the application which didn&#x27;t previously exist.  Each of these is a potential place for things to go wrong, which can give rise to other vulnerabilities (XSS, SQLi, etc) depending on what you&#x27;re doing with that input.  You&#x27;ll need to be sure that you validate the signature prior to doing anything with these unverified inputs, in addition to performing sanity checks on their contents prior to signing.  Part of secure application design is to minimize attack surface and complexity - this does the opposite.<p>- Once a signature is created, it can&#x27;t be revoked.  I mean, you could store the signature in the database and validate it&#x27;s presence on receipt, or include in your signed values a nonce that&#x27;s stored in the database, but that kind of defeats the goal of avoiding database storage.  This is something the article tries to address by signing over things like an expiry time, the user&#x27;s old password digest, etc.  But that&#x27;s insufficent as well (I&#x27;ll get into why below).<p>- While I&#x27;m not aware of anything allowing for HMAC key recovery in better than brute force, choosing a secure key is still important.  The article says nothing of the criteria a strong key should meet and a poor key could enable additional attacks.<p>- Even if you get everything right, key exposure is fatal.  You&#x27;ve introduced a single point of failure in the system that didn&#x27;t previously exist, and a fairly catostrophic one.  If the app ever leaks that key, you&#x27;re only option is to rotate it (assuming you detect the exposure), which invalidates any existing signed values.<p>That&#x27;s the broad points, let&#x27;s look at the article&#x27;s examples:<p><pre><code>  http://myapp.com/resetPassword?userId=johnnysmith&expirationTime=1356156000&token=%SECURITYHASH%
</code></pre>
Okay, so we have an irrevokable reset token for johnnysmith valid until 12/22/2012.  The article doesn&#x27;t mention where the key comes from.  Since the key is the only thing johnny doesn&#x27;t know, he can attempt as many keys as he wants offline.  If he gets a hit, he can now create a valid token for any account he wants.  <i>NOT GOOD</i>  If the key is sufficiently long and randomly generated, this becomes much more difficult to the point of infeasibility but if the key is weak, so too is the overall security.<p>As the article notes the token can also be reused multiple times, even if johnny has already used it. They offer a means of fixing this:<p><pre><code>  HMAC256(&quot;userId=johnnysmith&expirationTime=1356156000&oldBcryptHash=$oldBcryptHash&clientIpAddress=$clientIpAddress&quot;, $mySuperSecretKey)
</code></pre>
Okay, so with the bcrypt digest covered under the hash, a change of password will cause the signature to no longer match.  But now on verification we have to pull the user&#x27;s hash before calculating the HMAC, so we&#x27;ve added a database read back which reduces the perceived benefits.<p>Furthermore, this token is still valid if Johnny requests a password reset, and while waiting for the email to arrive remembers that he changed it from &#x27;Password123&#x27; to &#x27;Password456&#x27; and logs in.  There&#x27;s then a window of time where that token remains valid (until expirationTime arrives) and can be abused.  The article doesn&#x27;t address this case at all.  I suppose they&#x27;d say that on issuing a token, you should disable login to Johnny&#x27;s account until he&#x27;s reset, but how would you do this?  Well, you&#x27;d set a flag in that database on Johnny&#x27;s record, and we&#x27;re kind of back where we started again with both a database read and write, but with added cryptographic overhead and attack surface too.<p>The next example talks about account registration.  It states that you can verify a user&#x27;s email account by sending them a link to:<p><pre><code>  http://myapp.com/createAccount?email=johnnysmith@gmail.com&token=%SECURITYHASH%
</code></pre>
This doesn&#x27;t concern me as much as password recovery, since account creation is likely to be fairly anonymous anyhow and not nearly as security sensitive.  Still, it&#x27;s not technically true that the token validates your receipt of the email.  Instead, it validates your receipt of the email, or your knowledge of the key and values used to generate the token.  In practice, this is likely a small difference, but a truly random token stored in the database would require database access or visibility into the email to obtain, whereas this requires only knowledge of the key instead.<p>Case Study 3 talks about one-time-use and expiring resources.  There&#x27;s not enough detail here about their scheme for me to really critique, but they point out AWS/S3 use of HMAC signing as an example.  Except that AWS/S3 signing isn&#x27;t about one-time use or expiration.  Instead, it&#x27;s about authenticity.<p>AWS operates with an ACCESS_KEY and SECRET_KEY which are a pair of tokens related to each other.  Requests with &#x27;params&#x27; are signed as:<p><pre><code>  Signature = HMAC(ACCESS_KEY + params, SECRET_KEY)
</code></pre>
Signature, ACCESS_KEY, and params are sent to the server.  SECRET_KEY is the HMAC signing key.  On the server side, AWS presumbaly does a DB lookup for your ACCESS_KEY, obtains the corresponding SECRET_KEY, and validates the signature matches.  This authenticates that the requestor has knowledge of the SECRET_KEY, but it implies the existing of a database lookup.  If you think of the ACCESS_KEY as a username, you&#x27;ll see that this is really authenticating each request, as well as preventing tampering.  You can issue keypairs that&#x27;re good for only one use, or expire after a set time period, etc.  but there&#x27;s nothing implicit in the HMAC scheme that causes this.  Interestingly, this scheme almost certainly requires <i>storing the token in a server-side database</i> the exact thing the author wants to prevent.<p>This can be done reasonably well, but it&#x27;s a minefield to navigate when we have a tried and true solution.  What&#x27;s so bad about database storage of tokens?  The post kind of starts with the assertion that they should be avoided, but I see no clear explanation as to why.",1424120645

3202402,comment,3202165,3202385,3,0,swombat,,,"The iPhone, despite (and perhaps because) the fact that it's not a dedicated gaming platform, has wiped the floor with the portable gaming industry. Only fringe people and parents of young children buy a PSP or DS these days. Taking stats from [this article](1), even a successful portable console like the DS has sold only 50m units since <i>2004</i>. That's 8 years ago. That's 6 million units a year or thereabouts. The iPhone 4S approached that number by the end of launch weekend.<p>I can't imagine there are any gaming companies serious about portable gaming who don't consider iOS their primary market. Hundreds of millions of customers who actually buy apps. You'd have to be dumb to ignore that.<p>In the same way, I expect that if the Apple TV does deliver on basically the same sort of disruption that the iPhone delivered to the mobile phone industry, we will see consoles becoming, perhaps not extinct, but at least fringe. Why buy any console, even a Wii, when your Apple TV already supports thousands of cool games?<p>Of course, this makes a large number of assumptions about the Apple TV. But I don't think they're that far-fetched (though Apple may choose to go in a completely different direction, of course). So, if a disruptive Apple TV comes out, with its sights set on the TV industry as the iPhone had its sights on the mobile phone industry, you can bet your ass that consoles will be a barely noticeable casualty of this battle (in the same way that cheap HD cams, point-and-shoots, and a wide variety of single-purpose devices are being wiped out by the iPhone without even being its target).<p>Apple gets convergence. Any tech gizmo industry where you have to buy one device for each piece of functionality you want is in deep shit the moment Apple makes a move in their neighbourhood. Consoles are one of those industries.<p>[1] <a href=""http://venturebeat.com/2011/10/13/video-game-sales-drop-6-percent-in-september/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://venturebeat.com/2011/10/13/video-game-sales-drop-6-pe...</a>",1320579110

Just wow.<p>Every single system you name is made up of a large number of complex sub-systems designed and built to exacting requirements, and any one of them can still break at any time. Thinking you ""got it right"" just because it didn't break one time in one set of circumstances is unbelievably nave. There's a reason all man-rated launch systems have redundant backup systems, and even the fallbacks don't always work right.<p>By the way, let me know when you get micrometeoroid shielding ""right"" -- every space agency on Earth will want to talk to you. You might even win a Nobel Prize.<p>You're also completely ignoring navigation. Just because you can fire up a rocket doesn't mean shit if you're at the wrong point in your orbit, or pointed in the wrong direction.<p>You're also failing to distinguish between ""I can get THIS rocket into orbit"" and ""I can get a rocket big enough to carry people and a useful payload into orbit and/or to the moon"". Think you can just ""scale up""? You're wrong. Effects that were too small to measure before will suddenly kill you. Materials that could handle the strain of the smaller rocket will crumble under the increased forces.<p>Oh, by the way, every time the weight or configuration of your spacecraft changes, you're gonna have to rework your navigation assumptions.<p>Might I suggest playing with Orbiter for a while? Once you've done that, spend a few minutes thinking about the fact that you've just been overwhelmed by a vastly simplified simulation in which <i>nothing ever goes wrong</i>. Now picture the real world.<p>Oh, by the way, your heat shield is cracked, but nobody noticed because your budget didn't allow for more than one guy to inspect it, and he was too drunk.

If you look closely, the dow was down 7%. aapl's beta is 2.37, so we'd expect apple to fall 17%. goog's is 2.07 for 14.5%. yhoo's 1.19 gives 8%<p>since the market lost so much money last night, how badly are the tech giants fairing against expectation?
aapl:-4%
goog: 3%
yhoo:-3%<p>so, either Oh NOES! teh sky is falling! or tech stocks are more sensitive to market activity.",1222774483

I want clear, cogent argumentation with pertinent facts, and refutations of other points of view, not silly imagery (he does better elsewhere).  Like I said, I don't know if my car example is very good or not, but calling it ""stupid"" and going off on a rant is not the sort of commentary I'm after, which is, again, why I doubt I'll find much of value regarding the issue on this site - people here are hackers, not economists.",1222772711

There is a long tradition of ""odd outliers"" throughout history.<p>I do, however, appreciate this:<p><i>For a start the fact that they only believe in one religion and not all the others should be a red flag - an athiest and christian are very alike, the athiest just believes in one less god.</i>",1222772473

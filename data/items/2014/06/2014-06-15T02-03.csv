That depends on who would use this software, whether they&#x27;d pay you to support it or customize it, etc.<p>But apart from money, you&#x27;d likely get: other people reviewing, testing, debugging and maintaining your code; other people packaging your code for distribution on various platforms; other people helping to support users of your software on mailing lists and in forums; other people writing documentation; the satisfaction of providing something useful to others; and praise and thanks from users of FOSS.

The chronological book editions are more aimed for collectors than for casual readers, with conversely tiny print runs in comparison.<p>We get the chronological collections for collectors in Norway too, but they&#x27;re relegated to the same role as in the US (Asterix got the most fantastic collectors edition back in the 80&#x27;s: You could get all of the ones published by then in hardcover on extra heavy paper, with gilded edges, bound in wild boar skin...).",1402798097

(if that exists on HN?)<p>But .NET probably represents the largest block of applications I see. Seconded by (<i>shudder</i>) CF. I don&#x27;t really have any hope for CF but crypto is hardly it&#x27;s biggest problem.<p>As far as .NET goes, my first point was that the standard library does not support it; true in this case. I&#x27;m aware of CLR and Bouncy Castle as external libraries but neither of them inspires me with confidence.<p>Supposedly, CLR was released by Microsoft but why didn&#x27;t they include it in the standard library or release any associated security assessment reports? Were there any?<p>I&#x27;ve heard the name Bouncy Castle thrown around quite a bit but that&#x27;s about it. When I dig through their websites, it leaves me with a feeling not unlike trying to find information about Truecrypt. Granted, I haven&#x27;t followed their project(s) very closely. But because of that feeling, I honestly trust OpenSSL more because people are scared about it.<p>So, maybe I&#x27;m just missing something but this is where I&#x27;ve arrived. Please correct me if I&#x27;m way off base.",1402798089

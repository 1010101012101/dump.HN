I tried the Lenovo Tab 2 and Galaxy Note 10 because I wanted to replace my notebook I bring to meetings, but I was left unsatisfied and I returned both of them.<p>The Galaxy Note 10 requires some &quot;training&quot; to use, as the pen is not as responsive or sensible as a Wacom Intuos tablet, and the Samsung apps simply suck (Papyrus is the only Android drawing app I would actually consider). I write pretty fast, and I will definitely not slow down for inferior technology.<p>The pen is also ridiculously small, which becomes a pain to use after a while. The good thing is that you can have several Wacom-compatibile pens that you can &quot;steal&quot; from other brands. I opted for a Toshiba tablet pen (<a href=\"http://www.ebay.com/itm/Toshiba-GENUINE-Stylus-Tablet-PC-Pen-PA3316U-2ETC-/221317415231\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.ebay.com/itm/Toshiba-GENUINE-Stylus-Tablet-PC-Pen...</a>) because is much more comfortable to use. The pen from the Toshiba Exel Write also looks decent, but never tested it personally. The classic pen from the HP laptops is also &quot;good enough&quot;, but it&#x27;s not compatible.<p>The Lenovo Tab 2 was quite similar, but the responsiveness of Win8 in general (compared to the Note) makes a lot of difference. The Tab 2 is actually much more close to what could replace paper.<p>Both of these tablets also unfortunately lack tilt sensors, which would be nice to have for an artist. Like I said previously, I also own a couple of Wacom drawing tablets (intuos 5, several pens, a bamboo touch large, etc). If you have ever drew, you know that controlling pressure alone is not enough, tilt is very important. Nobody seem to have exploited the axial rotation yet, which I use a lot to control stroke size in addition to tilt while drawing lines with a soft pencil.<p>My biggest put-off tough is still the glossy screen. Whereas I can doodle anywhere with paper, in any position; I had to slightly tilt the tablet to get the office light reflection off my eyes in so many cases.<p>I&#x27;ll stick with my notebook and Pilot DR 0.3 for some more months before re-evaluating again..",1384876191

6761852,comment,6761234,6761664,1,0,jonnathanson,,,"A lot of that has to do with the way Twitter works. Following someone on Twitter is as simple as clicking &quot;Follow&quot; and forgetting about it. No social considerations to weigh, no social qualification (Do I actually know this person? Does he know me?), and no site qualification (Am I a real person? A bot? A highly connected person? A low-connected person?).<p>Joining a LinkedIn group asks a lot more of a user. There are multiple stages of pre-qualification, both user-initiated (seeking out and joining the group) and group-initiated (a lot of groups screen new members, for instance, screening &quot;Stanford Alumni&quot; for a Stanford email address of some sort). Your typical LinkedIn group membership is a lot smaller than a Twitter followership, but it&#x27;s more homogeneously centered around a specific dimension of mutual interest, and the leads are more higly qualified.<p>Twitter can work, and quite well, but it&#x27;s a painstaking process. Cultivating a qualified and influential Twitter following is tantamount to having a second full-time job. There are followerships of 100,000+ that have basically been hand-picked and nurtured. Those are the kind of followerships that actually work. If you have even 10,000 fans that hang onto your every word, and a decent portion of which have others who do the same for them, then your following is worth an order of magnitude more than a 100,000+ following of mostly bots and dead weight.<p>Getting to 1M+ followers on Twitter, based purely on buying or attracting bots or mutual follow/follow arrangements, is a nontrivial challenge and a serious waate of time and money. Not many people do it. This is why the sort of people who have 1M+ followers usually have a decent chunk of qualified followers, as well. These people tend to be famous outside of Twitter. I would be <i>floored</i> by any small business that managed to get into the hundreds of thousands of followers, let alone millions, with a strong percentage of qualified, active followers. It&#x27;s pretty easy to suss out the difference, too.",1384875658

6761842,comment,6761573,6761573,40,0,pcwalton,,,"Unsurprisingly, I disagree with most of this post.<p>* The part about Rust having no shared memory is just wrong. Rust has a very rich set of concurrency primitives at this point: you can use immutable shared memory (Arc), mutexes (MutexArc), reader-writer locks (RWarc), and atomic variables (AtomicInt and friends). And if you&#x27;re willing to drop down to unsafe code, you get the full set of LLVM concurrency primitives.<p>* The complaint about smart dereferencing strikes me as odd. Almost every new systems language—Objective-C, D, Go, and Rust (and also Nimrod I think?)—does the same thing that Rust does in that the &quot;.&quot; operator also works on pointers. It&#x27;s type-directed: if you don&#x27;t know whether you&#x27;re working with a pointer or not, just go look at the type of the value you&#x27;re working with. If you don&#x27;t know a value&#x27;s type, then you have much bigger problems than knowing whether you&#x27;ll get an extra memory access on &quot;.&quot;.<p>Hiding the difference between a memory access and a cheaper operation is something compilers have done ever since the invention of register allocation.<p>* I don&#x27;t know what the complaint about &quot;bugs with small objects&quot; is, but all word-sized objects were made into LLVM Values a while back, making us as efficient there as you can be. Unless I&#x27;m misunderstanding the complaint.<p>* Doing code duplication to accommodate different types of smart pointers doesn&#x27;t work. The smart pointers have different semantics: that&#x27;s why they exist in the first place. You can&#x27;t just copy and paste your code.<p>* The GC in Rust does need work. But so does C++&#x27;s GC and nobody is saying &quot;C++ is not fast&quot; because of it.<p>About the only part I agree with is is &quot;fork-join parallelism and work-stealing should be better supported&quot;. This is an area we&#x27;ll need to flesh out more fully at some point. Note that there is now a much more advanced work-stealing scheduler. (It&#x27;s not using the most efficient data structures for work stealing yet though.)",1384875601

I looked at the source and determined that the dependency was not necessary, and that I wanted to proceed without it. I could either rebuild the package myself, (which is not always trivial if the package maintainer did a lot more than just build and install the source), or ask the package manager to let me make the decision.<p>Apt provides no option, and if you attempt it, it will not allow you to do anything else to the system unless you remove the package with the missing dependency, requiring you to then re-install the same file every time you make a change to the system.<p>Zypper shows you a large warning about the consequence of installing packages without their dependencies. It then asks you if you would like to cancel the transaction, try and find the dependencies, or proceed at your own risk. It then honors that choice.<p>The latter is perfect!<p>edit: I&#x27;ll agree that this is bad practice, but this happens a lot with projects that were built back when Oracle JDK was legal to distribute that way, and they require that package. I can install the correct version of Java in all the ways the package expects - but then I need to create an empty package with the name it wants. I think that&#x27;s a worse work-around than explicitly overriding the dependencies.",1384875274

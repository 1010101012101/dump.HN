Your web site cum stats page has got to be the most useful information I have ever seen or heard of, for the small, hacker entrepreneur.<p>Of particular interest to me is that the price for your program is $29.95.  Being a software guy who never buys anything except necessities, books, and meals out, I have a hard time imagining myself in the place of a buyer.  The reality, of course, is that for some people, $29.95 for the bingo-card creator is a good deal, and you found them.",1248663526

725267,comment,724920,724920,0,0,jerf,,,"I've been able to do this to some degree for most of my life. It comes and goes. Lately I think this is connected to the temperature of the room I'm sleeping in, as it gets colder my dreams get more complex, chaotic, and lucid... but I actually try to avoid that, because it also makes my sleep less effective; I'd rather sleep well than have funny lucid dreams, which should give you a sense of how valuable they are.<p>It's sort of cute and fun, but I do sometimes wonder if this idea that it's some sort of life changing thing is either A: some people are wired differently enough that it happens for them, but this has little-to-no applicability for the rest of us or B: it's sort of become a New Age-style touchstone of faith that this is some sort of way of overcoming your mind or something and the claims that it's some sort of magical adventure are more wishes than reality, fed by the same sort of feedback loops that run most other New Age sorts of ideas.<p>Perhaps both.<p>I do admit to a little fascination by the parameters of what is controllable and what is not, rather more than the dream. This gets perilously close to the ""who cares?"" sort of dream discussion, but, hey, you're the one reading the comments on HN for an article entitled ""Can you teach yourself to control your dreams?"", so don't come crying to me about it. I have noticed:<p>* It is indeed sort of possible to completely rewrite the dream to do something like ""win the superbowl"", but the effort of the will involved is often enough to just flat wake you up. If you are thinking of getting into lucid dreaming I'd recommend less obtrusive changes. Flying's a good start.<p>* One common observation is that dreams involve your body image, which is in fact a real sense (related to proprioception but not the same). Your body image is surprisingly fuzzy in some ways; as the article mentions, you might not quite have five fingers. Another one I've found is that I must NOT look in a mirror for any period of time. Seeing your own facial image is distressing enough, then it starts... distorting. It's the same sort of thing as <a href=""http://growabrain.typepad.com/photos/uncategorized/four_eyes_illusion_1.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://growabrain.typepad.com/photos/uncategorized/four_eyes...</a> , only... worse.<p>* I find that while I fly quite freely, I can't actually get above everything. If I fly above one tree line, the next one is even higher, if I fly above that, there's suddenly an even bigger cliff, eventually I get stuck. I can transition from land into space but only if I close my eyes within the dream during the transition. I think this is actually because I don't fly much, and when I do it is as a passenger on a commercial flight; I have no internal frame of reference for really flying. Amusing while awake, sometimes frustrating when asleep.<p>* Any given trick only works twice well, then a couple more times with effort, then stops working, in quick succession. If I can walk through walls or windows, it works like that. If I pick up a weapon (<i>hey, I'm a guy</i>), it works like that. Flight tends to work like that. I think it may actually be neural, just like saying the same word continuously for 30 seconds makes the word ""stop being a word"".<p>I am aware of the possibility that this is a self-fulfilling prophecy. It may be. Doing any sort of science on this topic would be tricky for this reason, I think. For instance, this article says that light switches never work in dreams... well, mine do about 50% of the time. At least the text or time tests have some science behind them; ISTR claims that those parts of the brain really do shut down more so it makes sense that the vast majority of dreams will have trouble there. Still, every once in a while I do get a bit of stability on some text or something. I try not to think about it too hard, lest my brain talk itself into not giving me <i>any</i> clues it is asleep....",1248663274

It's my understanding that companies like RedHat (and JBoss specifically) obtain most of their revenue from support contracts, training and consulting for large IT groups.

This should be measurable somehow (number of calls attended / duration of calls / attended customer feedback)\n- If this person agrees, you ask for his phonenumber and availability for taking customer help calls (days/time)\n- When someone else comes to your site looking for help about what you sell, he can enter his phonenumber on a simple form and click on 'receive call'\n- Then (if available) the person who bought your stuff gets a phone call.

The drop between the paleolithic and neolithic coincides with the development of agriculture.<p>This is a pretty contentious issue.  The idea that humanity's single most (evolutionarily) successful technology caused a massive decline in individual quality of life is pretty disturbing, and some of the evidence is contradictory.  It seems like a debate best left to experts, but I thought it was worth mentioning.<p>I still agree with the original post -- we're very lucky to be alive now.",1248660778

Not all societies are built to accept democracies, and not all cultural mindsets are ready for it.  Taking China into perspective, if you are not Chinese and haven't lived in China in the past 50+ years, there is no way you can say or claim that you know what is needed there.  I'm not making any assertions that their govt is something praise worthy, but who are we to say that a western style democracy will work best for their society?  It's the same thing in Iraq and Afghanistan: We are trying to apply OUR ideals to a culture that doesn't have a clue what to do with it.  Just because it works for us doesn't mean it'll work for them.  Just look at the African states, and well, closer home, the Philippines.  The Philippine constitution was modeled after the US's, and so far, all they've had were a succession of presidents that have made a mockery of the system.  Why?  Because western govt ideals don't allow for unique Philippine cultural attitudes.<p>So,<p>I know the chinese govt is oppressive and has yet to embrace the concept of human rights.  I do believe the ruling regime and its system of govt should be abolished and wiped off the face of this modern world.<p>I know that working conditions in China will make the average McDonald's burger flipper in middle america thank his lucky stars he was born on american soil.<p>But, without knowing the nuances of its culture, what it considers 'tolerable' and what makes it 'tick', all you are doing is applying western ideals AS YOU SEE IT, to a culture that isn't nec. asking for it.<p>The best analogy I can give is it is like forcing a 6 month old baby to walk.  You can't without damaging the hell out of the kid's psyche.  It will walk when it is damn well ready.",1248660418

A few more to market and see sales (it takes time to close sales and generate site traffic). It should generate 10-20k this year, hopefully more next.<p>My advice is to focus on a niche market filled with people w/ money, willing to pay for stuff. And avoid any market/problem that your typical computer geek would be interested in or aware of (you want to relax on the beach, not code away 60hrs a week fearing some other startup will catch up and take the market away).",1248660030

Of course, those regions are in principle unobservable by us, but if it can vary on a large scale it'd be rash to rule out variation on a smaller scale.",1248660012

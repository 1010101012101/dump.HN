It is not unique to Arch to keep a system clean. Zypper in SUSE is also very capable of keeping things clean by just doing a zypper dup to go back to vanilla install again.

9678364,comment,9677204,9678328,0,0,blowski,,,"Personally, I think there are advantages and disadvantages. The big disadvantage is that small communities which have high social cohesion get squashed by the larger community, which leads to resentment and bitterness. In the UK, we see this with Scotland, Wales, Cornwall, Scouse, Geordie, the Black Country, etc. They have all been squashed by &#x27;Estuary English&#x27; (although some are making a resurgence).<p>Online communities (including StackOverflow and Hacker News) do much the same thing by putting rules in place about how people talk with each other. When people break those rules, we get upset, because we see those breaking the rules as &#x27;outsiders&#x27; and a threat to the community.<p>I believe that language can have much the same effect. When English comes in, it often results in people forgetting local mythology, songs, rituals, etc, as a result of forces like Hollywood and Simon Cowell. The community withers and is replaced by the great &#x27;meh&#x27;.",1433764467

A couple years ago, one study looked at what it would take to run a certain section of the U.S. electric grid on 99% wind/solar. They had a computer try 10,000 combinations and picked the cheapest, which was to overproduce energy by a factor of three, and add a little storage. That&#x27;s not just overcapacity, it&#x27;s actually producing that much extra energy to make sure you always have enough to meet demand.<p>On the nuclear side, molten salt reactors and factory-produced modular reactors have the potential to reduce costs quite a bit, if we can get the regulators up to speed.",1433763793

My dad, who was a malt whisky distillery manager, said I could work for a bit at his distillery as a warehouse man to fill in for one of the workers who was off sick. The job mainly entailed rolling filled casks from the filling store into the warehouses, unloading empty casks delivered from the coopers, moving and loading casks of mature whisky into lorry trailers, internal cask movements and cask &quot;dipping&quot; and inspections.<p>Dad was a real stickler for time keeping and we had to be on-site and in the rest room for the day&#x27;s briefing by 0800 on the dot, not a minute later.<p>I had been sailing pretty close to the wind for a few days and then one Thursday night went out and got quite drunk with pals, eventually getting to bed at around 3am - and yes, there was whisky involved. The next morning I had a stinking hangover, slept in, and arrived a whole five minutes late at the rest room. My dad said nothing about being late except for suggesting that it was about time I learned the ropes  on filling whisky barrels.<p>For the next two hours (and for my sins I suddenly realised) I filled whisky casks. This was done by hand. You basically have a big hose with a nozzle and a tap. The flow rate is quite high which means there&#x27;s a high speed out-gassing of very strong whisky fumes that hit you right in the face. The last thing you need with a whisky inflicted hangover is to be around the smell and fumes of more whisky, especially when it&#x27;s hitting you square in the face like a small gale.<p>It took all of my being not to be sick, or faint (pardon the pun), and was probably the best lesson on time keeping and not partying on his watch I&#x27;ve ever had. He never said anything that day except for a knowing wink and a wee grin that he gave me from the window of the weighing office as I silently retched and struggled to maintain my composure surrounded in sickening malt whisky fumes :)<p>We still have a laugh about that to this day yet.",1433763261

I doubt it, you can do anything in assembly, and BASIC is deliberately limited [4].<p>Doesn&#x27;t this definition make the &quot;power&quot; of all Turing-complete languages equal?<p>> In other words, Lisp was the Flub of its day. A few years ago Flub was Haskell, and recently the new contender appears to be Rust, judging from the buzz.<p>If the author thinks Haskell and, of all languages, Rust are most powerful, I think he has significantly misunderstood Graham&#x27;s original essay.<p>Among other things, they are statically checked with relatively difficult types that can take a long time to get right.  That is obviously not the kind of language Graham had in mind for agily prototyping around corporate behemoths.<p>The author seems to define Flub as &quot;the most popular language among the elite&quot;.  Lisp was rarely even that, however, and we also have painfully obvious evidence of the most popular not being the most powerful.  As such, I think a large portion of this essay hinges on a strawman: he dismantles a definition of Flub that Graham never used.<p>> The Flub Paradox can be stated like this: although Flub is self-evidently more powerful and productive than Blub, relatively few people use it and its effect on the real landscape of innovation appears minimal.<p>Is this really a paradox anymore?  We have so many examples of inferior products dominating through inertia that I&#x27;ve completely lost my faith in humanity at this point.<p>I could add a few more points, but I think that would only be unnecessarily negative.  I do like some points from the essay.  I agree that we should take another look at Paul Graham&#x27;s power continuum: for instance, the power of Lisp scales with lines of code (with low LOC, macros don&#x27;t really enter the equation, and using a &quot;batteries included&quot; language with comprehensive libraries is probably faster).  Haskell is easier than many agile languages to refactor, another important dimension to consider.  And so on.",1433762323

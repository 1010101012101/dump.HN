They aren't perfect. Mandating a monoculture of security software simply means that people have to use hacks that work against the current software. (Or a de facto monoculture brought on by a small set of legal choices, or a de facto monoculture brought on by a wide array of choices but one ""default"" choice. Note that ""allowing people to opt out"" is simply recreating the current situation, only with a lot more government for no apparent reason.)<p>Of course, quite a lot of those hacks will involve forging the presence of the software, making it look like the anti-virus is still running when it actually isn't. A task that is very difficult today, you made easy by ""mandating"" which software it needs to be, which is whatever the gov provides by default.<p>Even beyond the legitimate concerns expressed by the other posters, your idea is worthless from a security point of view. Security problems go well beyond ""not everybody is running a virus scanner"", or any other set of defined software, and you would actually make things worse, not better.<p>Of course you will disagree, because in your head security software is perfect and you can't perceive the massive problems that would result from your suggestion, since you're working with mental ideation primitives that don't correspond to anything that exists in the real world.

1020138,comment,1017932,1018627,0,0,coffeemug,,,"<i>So the solution is to create a secondary judicial system with no oversight so that anyone the government doesn't like can be punished for something they haven't actually done?</i><p>Look, you're reducing a very complicated issue with a huge amount of nuances and details to an easily refutable straw man argument. Life in a modern society requires recognition of different types of law violations, different types of punishments, and different acceptable response times. In order to operate in fair and effective manner, all of these require a different standard of proof. Putting a person in prison requires proof beyond a reasonable doubt. Having a person compensate someone financially requires 50% + 1 of the jury. A parking ticket requires a quick decision from a bench judge. You <i>could</i> set up a system where a parking ticket could be contested by a trial by jury, but this cannot be practically implemented without a huge strain on the legal system.<p>TSA agents have to make a simple decision - whether to do a detailed search or not. This cannot be done to every passenger, the decision must be made fast, and it can affect other people's lives. It is not in any way a ""punishment"", only a minor inconvenience. In this case suspicious activity is a reasonable standard of proof for a detailed search. If you want off the watchlist, you should be able to have a hearing to clear your name, you should be notified that you've been added to such a list (barring some exceptions that should require judicial oversight), etc. Nobody is talking about a secondary judicial system with no oversight. You're picking the worst possible implementation and shooting it down - this really isn't productive.<p><i>Why wouldn't someone on the watchlist not just pay someone not on the watchlist to carry the bomb through security then?</i><p>For any possible security measure you could come up with a countermeasure that would theoretically render it ineffective, but that doesn't mean that we should sit back and do nothing. It does mean that we should attempt to find a systematic, scientific way of measuring cost vs. benefit of any proposed measure, but this is a difficult, time consuming problem. Until we do, we should implement security measures that appear reasonable. To give a counterargument to your specific complaint, a watchlist significantly complicates the job of a potential terrorist. The more people know about the job, the higher the probability of a leak. I will conjecture that the probability of a leak with respect to the number of people that know about the job isn't a linear function, it's likely closer to exponential, which means forcing a potential terrorist to recruit someone not on the watchlist might be a cheap and effective way to ensure that a leak happens. I don't know how effective it is in practice (I'd be interested in seeing large scale studies), but until we find out, intuitively it seems like a good idea.",1262069060

All the data is properly threaded in and out of functions, and there are no truly destructive updates to speak of. Now pick the two lowest-level and most isolated functions in the entire codebase. They’re used all over the place, but are never called from the same modules. Now make these dependent on each other: function A behaves differently depending on the number of times function B has been called and vice-versa.<p>In C, this is easy! It can be done quickly and cleanly by adding some global variables. In purely functional code, this is somewhere between a major rearchitecting of the data flow and hopeless.</i><p>I am almost certain a Haskellite will say something about monads or arrows, but I don't know what.<p>EDIT: I guess another criticism might be ""when would you possibly need this?"".

1020114,comment,1017708,1019996,0,0,elblanco,,,"I'm confused as to what you consider an MMA style (honest question)? Judo, while not terribly new (turn of the 20th century), <i>is</i> a sportified Jiu-Jitsu and is firmly rooted in traditional Japanese styles which <i>is</i> about as traditional as you can get (not Brazilian). Judo was a style for a hundred years before the acronym ""MMA"" was a twinkle in the Gracie family's eye. I would never categorize Japanese Jiu-Jitsu variants in with modern MMA styles like (BJJ+Muay Thai (which I categorize differently than either pure style on it's own) or whatever the Lion's Den teaches or Vale Tudo). There is something intrinsically different about the modern MMA styles from the old styles (even though they have a heck in a lot in common).<p>Good call on Cung Le. I didn't count him since I've watched him mostly in pure San Shou bouts before he went MMA.<p>I think the salient point is that in the modern sense, people go to practice a traditional style, but it's all over-specialized and taken out of context.<p>The context being that traditionally, something like ""Karate"" was practiced as part of a holistic training curriculum and not in the singular style sort of over-specialized way people do it nowadays (but much more like how modern MMA trains). A person of the warrior class in whatever society learned a very wide variety of fighting methods, from barehanded fighting, to grappling, to fighting with a pike, a bow and arrow, a sword, from a horse, from on foot, in formation, one-on-one etc. they learned tactics, strategy, command, etc. These people learned to fight from the time they could stand on two feet and that's pretty much all they did all day, every day. You find this same kind of pattern throughout history and across the planet.<p>But doing something like learning to sword fight today is regarded with mild amusement by most people as not practical and not a serious path to self-defense, yet sword fighting is about as tested and time-honored as you can get. Fighting with swords makes the modern MMA styles look like a 4:00 school yard fight at an elementary school. Musashi for example <i>killed</i> a few dozen people in one-on-one duels, forget some pitiful 15-1 win-loss record in pro MMA bouts or whatever. The Spartans are the stuff of legend, they'd eat somebody like Lyoto Machida for breakfast and the entire Lion's Den for a mid-day snack before lunching on the Gracie Clan and going hungry for dinner unless they happened to march into a Vale Tudo match on their way to the bathroom.<p>The second point is that almost no MMA stylist is a purist, hence the ""mixed"". A typical mix is some kind of grappling (BJJ or some such), some kind of striking (typically Muay-Thai) and a bit of a few other things as icing. The point being is that modern MMA is doing nothing new that the traditional ""styles"" we all denigrate as being unpractical in the modern world have been doing for a few thousand years. I'd be willing to wager that any 17th century member of Japan's warrior class could give a hell of a bare knuckle fight to Brock Lesnar. And that guy most definitely practiced something like Karate. But he also supplemented his striking with a study of some kind of grappling.<p>Basically the same formula we see today, and have been seeing for time immemorial.",1262067353

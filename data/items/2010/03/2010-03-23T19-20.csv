The senator's proposed bill doesn't say what inflation adjustment will be used to convert these numbers, established in 1982, to today's dollars. But if we use the Bureau of Labor Statistics inflation calculator to adjust these figures on the basis of the consumer price index, then the annual income requirements for accredited investor status would become $449,000 if the investor were single and $674,000 if the investor were married, while the net worth requirement would become $2.25 million.</i><p>So, in other words, the bill's not even finished being drafted and they made some noise about maybe adjusting some figures, but they have CPMs to sell so they'll just assume ""adjust"" means ""multiply by 2.25"" and get the snappy headline.<p>That said, Dodd clearly shouldn't do anything to hurt actual startup investment.",1269373362

But at the last second, a thought occurred to me: if there's a deficiency in Unicode that prevents its use for Japanese, isn't the right solution to just fix that deficiency?<p>I mean, Unicode is meant to be an abstract representation of glyphs, separate from any encoding, that works for all of Earth's languages.  It's tailor made to be a programming language's internal representation of a string.  This is its raison d'etre.<p>So it seems to me that #2 is definitely The Right Wayâ„¢ and that if there's some problem with Unicode that has kept Ruby from adopting it, they should have worked on fixing it, rather than breaking Ruby.  OK, ""break"" is probably too strong a word for the state of Ruby 1.9.  And in the real world, fixing an international politicized standard like Unicode is probably impossible.  So I can see that this pragmatic solution might have been the only one available.  But still, it seems wrong to me.<p>Out of curiosity, what exactly is the deficiency in Unicode that caused Matz to go with option 3?  I presume there are epic flamewars all over the internet about this issue, but I just haven't been paying close enough attention.",1269373334

These events have been analyzed only superficially until now. If I wrote the code to analyze and plot the data, it would work on new data also and would make Mixpanel somewhat redundant (dealing with updates is a non-issue, it's the logic that's difficult, not dealing with more data).<p>However, I don't want to reinvent the wheel, or to invest a lot of time in something that other apps like Mixpanel, NuConomy already do very well. I suspect Mixpanel uses the timestamps of the events for billing and if so they might require some non-trivial changes to their business logic to allow historical data. I hope they will, someday.

It mentions that Dodd wants to connect the accredited investor metrics to inflation but admits that it does not know how that will happen. Then it makes a silly guess out of the blue how it may happen and and assumes that is how it will happen and then goes on to complain how it will be the end of the world. This is a classic straw man argument.<p>Here's the thing - politicians do not like to make drastic changes unless they are warranted. I guarantee you Dodd is not going to double the income and net worth requirements for accredited investors overnight. The requirements will probably be connected to inflation starting now, which means they will keep their current values when the law passes and will slowly increase with inflation in the future.",1269372841

He says that these fields are important, that we should be concerned that Americans are choosing to pursue other career paths, and that programs like the H1B are reducing the incentives further.  But I'm not seeing an argument about why the US shouldn't just go ahead and staff all these positions with relatively poorly paid foreign nationals on visas.<p>This reminds me of Phil Greenspun's (perhaps tongue-in-cheek) opinion<p>""What's my idea for changing the incentives? I don't have any. I'm not one of the people who complains that there aren't enough women working as professors, janitors, or whatever. For whatever reason we've decided that science in America should be done by low-paid immigrants. They seem to be doing a good job. They are cheap. They are mostly guys, like other immigrant populations. If smart American women choose to go to medical, business, and law school instead of doing science, and have fabulous careers, I certainly am not going to discourage them. Imagine if one of those kind souls that Summers was speaking to had taken Condoleezza Rice aside and told her not to waste time with political science because physics was so much more challenging. Just think how far she might have gone...""<p>(full link at: <a href=""http://philip.greenspun.com/careers/women-in-science"" rel=""nofollow"">http://philip.greenspun.com/careers/women-in-science</a>)<p>Personally, I'm not nearly as cavalier about this, because I think that the availability of cheap foreign labor in a critical field is a short term phenomenon.  India and China are already starting to lure back their students, and this trend will increase.  I wouldn't be surprised if the day comes where India and China are hiring away US born engineers - it's still decades away, but it may well happen.<p>Some would say ""ok, then market incentives will increase, and Americans will start to return to engineering.""  Sure, but slowly.  I personally don't think it's quite that easy.  It's more a question of population dynamics.  Think of a species that has been reduced greatly in population... the passenger pigeon was headed for extinction without intervention even when large flocks were still observed.<p>Engineering takes time, effort, a system, a pipeline, mentorship, and so forth.  Basically, it takes people like my grandfather (an engineer) encouraging me to take up the profession, and me encouraging my son, daughter, nephew, the kid on the street, to take it up too.  I think that if you break this chain severely, it can take generations to restore it to health, if you manage to do it at all.<p>It seems easy to import engineers right now, but it won't always be so.  There was that story about Hemingway asking a man how he went bankrupt - the reply was ""I went bankrupt slowly and then all of a sudden"".  I think the cheap availability of talent is what masks the destruction of this profession, and I think the US could very quickly find itself in an very bad position.<p>I think that ensuring a healthy, engaged, optimistic domestic pipeline of engineers should be a top priority for the US, and our policies seem to be giving us the oppposite (by the way, a healthy percentage of international students and practitioners enhances this, the problem is when the US interest starts to plummet to dangerous levels).",1269371610

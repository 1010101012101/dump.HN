So in theory a man or woman could be perfect.<p>Rand writes about these larger than life types of people.  Most of us only see shades of them in ourselves or people we know, but it sure beats the idea of guilt/imperfection as a birthright thanks to original sin!<p>I bring this up b/c western culture is so heavily influenced by Christianity that it pollutes even people's secular understanding of what perfection means.<p>As I recall someone got a 10 at the olympics this year.",1221555152

If you want to render under Windows, you need to call windows code at the end, don't you?...You can directly call Win32 API, or go through .NET, or use MFC or WTL wrappers.

305582,comment,304581,305445,0,0,gunderson,,,"The point of a novel of ideas is not that you agree with every single idea within, but that the novel presents the ideas in a way that brings out their power in a concrete way.<p>Ayn Rand didn't want people to form a religion, so please don't feel that you have to apologize for ""agreeing"" with some aspects of her fiction.  Those who try to paint Rand's philosophy that way are looking at it through the timid, dark-ages lens of their religion, in which everything is black and white, the way George W. Bush's ""good vs evil"" nonsense is.",1221554890

How many top-tier startups are there in comparison to total number on non-accelerator startups?

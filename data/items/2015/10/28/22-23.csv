10468019,comment,10466676,10466676,0,0,Nicholas_C,,,"In college my friend told me about this gig selling art that I took him up on. We picked up a moving truck from a warehouse and drove it to a city about 20 hours away and set up art sales in hotels. When I asked the owner of the operation where the paintings were from he said Asia.<p>The paintings themselves appeared to be legitimate paintings. Most were different, but a few were very similar to other paintings packed into the truck. Often an object in the painting was moved slightly. Some even looked like classic paintings, I found one or two variations of Van Gogh&#x27;s Starry Night, as mentioned in OP&#x27;s article.<p>Each one of these paintings sold for about $40-$100, depending on size.<p>I made decent money for a college kid but I declined a second gig as I was concerned about where these paintings were coming from. I pictured a sweatshop like scenario with painters inhaling fumes while getting paid pennies for each painting. It&#x27;s good to hear that probably isn&#x27;t the case, at least according to this article. The paintings were also marketed as being painted by &quot;starving artists&quot; and the whole operation felt a little dishonest.",1446073106

I&#x27;m reminded that right now as I type this in Safari, which some time ago made the decision to hide virtually all of the current URL except for the domain name. If you think back a few years farther back, then you remember when URLs and search boxes had different inputs, rather than the omnibox that is now standard feature across the major browsers...which means that the conscious recognition of the URL is even less likely among most users.<p>Furthermore, the design trend is such that in most consumer-friendly websites, users have been trained/encouraged to share via buttons -- this is something that Google itself explicitly encourages in Google Maps -- again, deemphasizing the fact that URLs are (well, <i>generally</i>) available in the omni-box.<p>So I think it&#x27;s a reasonable assumption that users who copy-paste from the omnibox are relatively rare. And those that <i>do</i> do it have something that button-pushers <i>don&#x27;t</i>: the ability to examine what they&#x27;ve just copied-pasted.<p>Again, I don&#x27;t think this is a case of &quot;Oh, but everyone <i>should</i> know better than to blindly do such-and-such&quot;, a sentiment that many of us agree is <i>wrongly</i> applied to the hitting &quot;OK&quot; on agreeing to indecipherable TOS screens. But I can see why it&#x27;s not an obvious design decision given the feature set that Google wants in its search functionality. The more I think about it, the more I think it should be more incumbent upon the user to notice what they of their own volition have decided to send out as text.<p>How is that different than the expectation required of users who send out screenshots? When I want to screenshot a webpage on my desktop -- even though I intend just to show the webpage, I know <i>not</i> to use the fullscreen-capture option because it will capture lots of metadata, even if the browser page itself is in full screen. Same deal on an iphone, in which screen-capture will leak metadata about you as a user (when the photo was taken and thus, possibly your time zone. And also your carrier) unless you intentionally crop it out before sending. And cropping out photos is very unintuitive on iphones (i.e. it is not easy to do without jumping into a third party application)",1446073085

There are common law precedents going back many hundreds of years and plenty of statue law that reflect this interpretation of copyright.<p>One of the roles of copyright systems and regulated public markets for copyright has been to reduce the number of unnecessary lawsuits. Instead of a world where people are using the justice system to properly route payments to authors and publishers, it was decided to introduce a concept of honorarium payments.<p>These lawsuits are not going to go away. Copyright is baked right in to the constitution of the United States and has been a part of Anglo-American government and legal systems for hundreds of years prior.<p>The only way to stop the lawsuits in the United States would be with a constitutional amendment that took away congress&#x27; right to establish, regulate and enforce a public copyright monopoly.<p>The current copyright monopoly is pretty far removed from the intentions laid out by the US Constitution, the Copyright Act of 1790 and the Statue of Anne, but the foundations, that authors have a right to a limited monopoly on authored works and thus a right to any of the profits had on putting that property to use, are quite robust from the standpoint of individual rights balance with those of the public good, and most importantly, at creating a functioning commercial marketplace for ideas.",1446072717

An airline reservation system shouldn&#x27;t be able to give out multiple conflicting tickets, because it doesn&#x27;t have a lock on them; RAFT and PAXOS are designed to combat precisely this.<p>However, in the real world, waiting for consensus before making decisions is hard, so airline systems, designed in the era before realtime communication back to the mothership was possible, faked it. They made a reservation, issued a ticket, and then the airline developed protocols to deal with the resulting overbooking. In fact, since airlines already had incentive to overbook and deal with overbooking because of no-shows, they simply built the failures of their locking system into their cost-models.<p>There is a &#x27;correct&#x27; solution to this: When you believe you&#x27;re going to be split-brained some of the time, pre-allocate tickets to entities. Those entities can use their local tickets, but cannot make use of remote tickets without approving them with the systems that own them. Sharding the state of the plane down to individual seats has system complexity cost, but allows perfect booking.",1446070776

These &quot;root programs&quot; are the only thing that prevents rogue/incompetent CAs from mis-issuing certificates on a regular basis.<p>Since the CA business model is based on selling digital signatures that meet specific requirements, the threat of those certificates not working as advertised is compelling.<p>On the other hand, the client vendors can&#x27;t go overboard with requirements on existing &quot;too big too fail&quot; CAs because the alternative is having large portions of the Internet stop working in their products due to untrusted certificates.<p>Edited to add: Google doesn&#x27;t run its own root program, they use the OS root store, which will be from Apple, Microsoft, or Mozilla (most Linux distros use the Mozilla list). This means that the requirements from Google are in addition to those of the OS that is being used.",1446070018

The difference in customizing new cars is absolutely astonishing. Let&#x27;s take a look at a VW Jetta, sold both in the EU and the US. The &quot;regular&quot; one seems to be the Jetta SE so lets look at that.<p>In the US configurator (<a href=""https://www.vw.com/builder/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.vw.com/builder/</a>) for a new Jetta SE you choose between 1, engine, 1 transmission, 1 type of wheels, 7 colors, 1 interior color, and have 0 optional extras I&#x27;m not sure why the damn configurator takes me through page after page with no choices. That gives you SEVEN different models of Jetta SE. A dealer has to have SEVEN Jetta SE in his lot to be able to sell a customer ANY car he could have built on the site. Under those circumstances, I too would find it pretty shocking to <i>wait</i> several months because I wanted the red Jetta and the dealer had only one blue and two silver.<p>But now look a the UK page: <a href=""http://www.volkswagen.co.uk/new/jetta-gp/configure"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.volkswagen.co.uk/new/jetta-gp/configure</a><p>We have<p>7 engines to choose from (cheating, non-cheating etc)<p>5 wheel options<p>10 exterior colors<p>9 interior colors/trims<p>50 optional extras<p>So even if we can probably guess that a lot of the extras will be packaged in nearly every car, and some of the options like wheels could be switched by the dealer himself, a dealer couldn&#x27;t reasonably have less than at least a few thousand Jetta SE&#x27;s if he wanted to be certain to have the car I want. He isn&#x27;t going to. So what I do is a configure my car from the several hundred thousand different configurations of Jetta SE I want, then I go to a delaer, haggle a few percent off the price, sign a piece of paper, and wait a couple of months for it to be built. Or I buy a used one in his lot, which is cheaper, but isn&#x27;t exactly what I want.<p>As for horror stories: I just learned about &quot;delivery fees&quot; in the US.",1446069848

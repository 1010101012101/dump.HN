You need to be able to refine your idea into something easily expressible and understandable.<p>Our only long answer is to ""What might go wrong?""  Our list is a little humorous, so hopefully YC won't mind the length.  Even so, it's only 150 words, so it's not too much longer than their suggested length.",1191531164
63199,comment,63009,63178,0,0,anamax,,,"The different thing about the web is that a biz doesn't need to be physically close to its customers.  In fact, there frequently aren't any advantages to being close to said customers (or it's impossible to be close to all of them because they're spread out).<p>However, there are still advantages to a biz being close to itself and its resources.<p>The combination of those to things means that startup hubs will become stronger.",1191530954
63198,comment,63009,63009,0,0,ceesai,,,"The title of the talk (or article) is ""future of web startups"" and most of what is in it is satisfyingly accurate and perhaps marginally prescient. Except for the jump to the gushing, meritocratic tubes of the future. This much is true about startups; they are high-risk high-reward options, with the risk basically come down to around monetary opportunity cost now. Smart people definitely have a better chance at succeeding at these and college is not necessary for success  at startups. Read that again. Success at startups. What most young people (I am in my mid-twenties and almost definitely going down the start-up trail so I do not speak from any graying high horse) do not understand is that priorities change as you age. And not just fuzzy notions of priority engendered by cultural forces, but those fostered by your own biology. There is literature, and longitudinally applied common sense, suggesting so.\nThe opportunity cost of foregoing college is changing, not evaporating. Yes you can pick most of those lessons on the web, and the elitist cachet of iv(or)y league schools is losing its allure. In fact, you don't need to live in a dorm to have an immersive social experience, not that many here do anyways. The oppurtunity cost is that of being thrust into social situations with people whose interests and desires don't align with yours. It is about being part of a tribe for four or more years and finding a niche to flourish within that tribe. Most geeks don't get this anyways, and the evolutionarily obtained multiple equilibria of personalities are partitioned into the black and white of nerds and jocks. \nOK, not all are that extreme,but branding the gentle friction of shallow social interactions as 'fake' is rather blinkered. That is an opinion, or even a delusion, and may suit some well, but do understand that what works for some does not work for all.\nWe can all of course go on with our sheltered lives deciding not understanding why some cultural institutions have evolved (and why their need may eventually be obviated) and it cannot be a bad life. An ignorant life is in fact a blissful one isn't it? But to distort and distill the argument into catchy trade-off: ""startups leads to success; college leads to catalepsy"" is not even apples and oranges. ..<p>One last thing: Recognize that success is a shape-shifting beast.<p>",1191530884
63197,comment,62617,62617,0,0,geebee,,,"""Everybody Tests"" is a good point.  Some devs throw away their tests, and other devs keep the tests around and run them periodically, but devs who write code iteratively (which seems like pretty much all of them) write something that could be easily turned into a unit test.<p>If you don't like TDD (and I have to admit I'm not a fan), you can still produce tests while you write code (you probably already are). Whenever you write a bit of code, you probably do something to check whether it is producing the expected outcome - even if it is as simple as writing a little script to generate some output that you visually inspect as it flashes by on the screen.  If it looks good, you keep developing.  If it fails, you figure out why.  <p>Just store your these mini-testing scripts in a unit test, and verify the expectation/output in a short statement.  If you use a framework, you'll have some methods for this available to you - if you don't, no biggie, just write something that honks loud and gives you a message diagnosing the failure.  <p>It's not going to satisfy the TDD crowd, and honestly your coverage won't be as good as if you had done TDD, but there you go - you just got yourself some unit tests, and you didn't have to disrupt the mental flow that you prefer to TDD.

63194,comment,63009,63009,0,0,herdrick,,,"The funny thing about a great metaphor is that it somehow makes it easier to draw conclusions.  If Paul had only said, ""A startup now can be just a pair of 22 year old guys, so they can move to a new town pretty easily, so we'll probably see more clustering of startups, not less"" then you'd nod and continue on.  But instead he said this about startup hubs: ""the particles they're attracting are getting lighter.""  Suddenly you can see it and feel it: move your startup to Palo Alto!  Buy real estate in Mountain View!  It's so obvious!",1191530130

If you can't reformulate your pitch to be convincing and succinct, I would bet that your idea is just not a compelling idea. So try to come up with a short and sweet pitch, and if you can't, you should really rethink whether your idea makes sense. Compressibility of the pitch is probably a good first-order heuristic for judging the worth of an idea.<p>If it's a different question, just delete stuff until you get it under 120 words.

  ads. It is clear that Google is the king of ads,

</code></pre>
A well-turned phrase, but actually Facebook has intention in a way far more nuanced than what Google captures.  When I ""like"" something on Facebook not only am I sharing my intention, but a very focused one that <i>directly reflects my interests</i>.  I may search Google for things not directly relevant to me (homework, curiosity) I may buy or look for things on Amazon that are not for me (gifts, price comparisons) but if you like something on Facebook chances are that Facebook can strongly infer what other things you may like--Netflix has in fact profited off of this exactly (as has Amazon) and it is possible to build a recommendation engine from this data that will have greater potential than Google's because it can predict what ads will be likely to resonate with customers.",1337637352

Cheap guitars really are worse -- not just in the quality of their sound or their durability, but in their playability. It is much more difficult to get a really cheap guitar to work right. A $100 guitar is going to be much more difficult to play than a $500 one.<p>That's primarily due to the ""action"" -- the height of strings above the frets. On a cheap guitar, the (im)precision of the components -- the bridge and its springs, the neck tension bar, etc., conspire to make it so that the higher frets have much higher action (or else the lower ones buzz). That forces the player to squeeze the strings harder to the neck, which is painful, and is less forgiving about finger placement within the fret, requiring that fingers go closer to the fret rather than allowing more space behind it.<p>The end result is that a new player, not wanting to invest too much money in something that he doesn't know if he'll like, is more likely to be discouraged and give up. If he'd had a better tool from the beginning, success would have been more likely.",1337635107

I think they're brilliant at taking an existing consumer product and dominating it by making something that's radically better designed and made. They are very willing to let other people pioneer a category and prove the market before coming in to crush their competitors, drive their executives before them, and hear the lamentation of their women.

But clearly the nature of GitHub's pull request UI is sufficiently misleading (or the documentation sufficiently incomplete) to wrongly convince some smart people that pull requests can always change while you're reviewing them, and that there's nothing you can do about that. In this case, that misunderstanding caused them to ignore the entire feature. I just wanted to point out a neat trick that (probably) not many others had spotted before.<p>Now, in actual fact I would personally choose to use standard branch-based pull requests anyway, because you get to rebase your branch while work progresses on master.

I introduced git into that shop I'm working at, the rogue 'I set it up, would you technical guys like to work with it' way. This happened 1.5 years earlier, today it's the blessed and only source control in play (ignoring one sad division having to deal with tfs.. Oh the agony).<p>So, I a) was the driving force pushing git and b) work in an environment where unix/linux knowledge is rare and ssh is a weird thing.<p>You are, again and again in this thread, missing the point and just plain insulting. Take it from this guy that types this message from his linux box and has a linux to windows box ratio of 5:1..: The git toolset sucks. It's crap for people that are used to windows only. You can mock people for them being uncomfortable with putty-gen (more likely, btw) or ssh-keygen, but the fact is that it's arcane and unintuitive to do that, if you have no clue what ssh is in the first place.<p>It doesn't help that git really doesn't _need_ ssh. It's just one (well, _the_ one) protocol you can use. I've coworkers that generated their key and didn't keep it afterwards. They thought it's kind of like a registration or that the client will keep this 'stuff' around somewhere. Most 'git doesn't work' errors are related to crappy windows clients being not helpful if the ssh key isn't available (ssh-agent/pageant not running or key not loaded).<p>SSH, in the company I work at, is 'that git stuff'. You consider that funny? Well.. Go ahead. My totally socially awkward inner geek might agree with you, but to the real world you're laughing about a weird kind of a maths joke right now.

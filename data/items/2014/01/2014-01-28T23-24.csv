7140732,comment,7139175,7139699,3,0,vectorpush,,,"<i>There has been a development of hate towards CoffeeScript in most JavaScript communities.</i><p>This is FUD. CoffeeScript <i>is</i> JavaScript, and if you come into CoffeeScript thinking it works like ruby just because it looks like ruby then you&#x27;re in for a rude awakening.<p>Personally, I&#x27;m a fan of CoffeeScript&#x27;s streamlined syntax compared to JavaScript.<p>For example:<p><pre><code>  describe &#x27;when the universe exists&#x27;, -> \n    it &#x27;should be active&#x27;, -> \n      expect(universe.active).toBe true\n</code></pre>\nvs<p><pre><code>  describe(&#x27;when the universe exists&#x27;, function(){\n    it(&#x27;should be active&#x27;, function(){\n      expect(universe.active).toBe(true);\n    });\n  });\n</code></pre>\nIt&#x27;s no surprise that newcomers are sometimes inclined towards CoffeeScript since one the biggest obstacles for a budding javascript programmer is the seemingly incomprehensible labyrinth of brackets, parenthesis and semicolons (not to mention the confusion that ASI adds to the picture) that one must endure to grok the language. Of course, it&#x27;s not really <i>that</i> hard to understand, but CoffeeScript filters out a lot of &quot;syntax&quot; making it easier for a newcomer to tackle the meat of the application. Less is more.",1390953318

You can set your salary, and you can also pay yourself in distributions.  Salary is subject to FICA, distributions are not.  Both are subject to income tax.<p>When you pay yourself salary, your &quot;personal&quot; side pays its half of the FICA, and your &quot;business&quot; side pays the other.  This is the same way a regular employer/employee relationship works (and why it &quot;feels&quot; like you are paying double FICA when you&#x27;re self-employed; it&#x27;s because you are both the employee and the employer).<p>It <i>used</i> to be that you could severely limit your salary, and pay yourself the bulk of your income through distributions, and lower your tax bill by having lower FICA costs.<p>These days, it is your responsibility to pay yourself a &quot;reasonable salary&quot;, as in something you could reasonably defend during an audit.  Once you have paid yourself a reasonable salary (which is subject to FICA), you can give yourself more money (revenue permitting :) ) in distributions.<p>Also, if your self-employment is part-time, you can pro-rate your salary to reflect that part-time employment.<p>It&#x27;s also worth noting that as your business gets successful and long-term, you may <i>want</i> to increase your salary and pay into FICA so you can get a better social security payment when you retire.  But still, if you analyze it in a spreadsheet, you&#x27;ll see that social security, as an annuity, is a &quot;bad deal&quot; when you&#x27;re paying both sides.  (It&#x27;s a very good deal as a W-2 employee with someone else paying the employer half, though.)",1390953291

Especially for the bad points, seriously, it&#x27;s worth keeping an open mind about what could be possible if we thought about how the world is moving towards treating data as essentially infinite.  I think computers of the future will work more like how Google does things with map reduce and Go.  It just kills me every time I can&#x27;t find something on my hard drive when I KNOW so much about it, what I was thinking at the time I made it, and not so much its name or contents.  Or when I lose hours, or even days, trying to make the simplest command work in the shell, or set up a config file (for BIND etc).  I think UNIX reached a pinnacle with Mac OS X but now it will enter a long period of slow decline as multiprocessing and higher level languages begin to replace all of the things that we used to do by hand.  Especially with regard to how we develop software today, so much of it (makefiles, even compiled code), while not necessarily UNIX-centric, is going to go the way of the dodo.  I find anymore that the vast majority of my time, perhaps as high as 90%, goes to learning curves, getting anything to work at all, and fumbling in the dark without being able to see where a problem comes from.  The operating systems of the future, whatever form they take, are going to solve these problems in ways that I think would be difficult with a command prompt mindset.",1390952541

I hope you are over playing the despair part, but if you really feel that every sucks then you should speak a professional to help give you perspective. Seriously, your mental health matters.<p>2.) Create a list of everything you need to do, then start to work through it.<p>a.) Have a <i></i>conversation<i></i> with your wife. Inform her about what&#x27;s happening, what issues you&#x27;re facing, and ask her about her thoughts. Get on the same page, that way there are two of you working through this. What&#x27;s her game plan? She&#x27;ll likely have some action items that should go onto your list.<p>Get your emotions out, but then move on. I&#x27;ve been doing the startup thing for 14+ years and married for 8+. I cannot emphasize enough that you should not overburden your spouse. She&#x27;s got a lot on her plate now, so get your emotions out once (if you&#x27;re into that), then stay upbeat.<p>b.) Schedule a meeting with your investors. Have a set agenda, use a PowerPoint (or other presentation software) that outlines your current status, etc. Also, show that you are a professional by showing them you have a plan/budget/timeline to shutdown the business.<p>Your investors are professionals. They know that a large percent of early startups fail. What they will want from your is professionalism.<p>Also, ask for their input. What do they need you to do?<p>c.) Legal: Speak with your attorney (this can also be before #b). Get their input on your legal checklist.<p>You must shutdown the business correctly. Your attorney will be a big asset. Keep your meeting with them professional and focused. Don&#x27;t waste time on emotions in this meeting.<p>d.) Schedule a team meeting and speak with your employees. Help them transition if you can. If you&#x27;re overwhelmed, which it sounds like, then tell them you&#x27;ll be happy to give glowing references. This is easy and will require minimal work on your part while keeping the relationship alive.<p>As with #a, don&#x27;t overburden your employees with your emotions. Sorry, but complaints flow up, not down. They will have their own pressures, and your job as a manager is to help assuage their fears and help them see that everything will be ok.<p>e.) It sounds like you don&#x27;t have kids. Yah! Seriously, grab a beer. This is so much easier without kids.<p>f.) Fill-in this list with input from everyone above plus your co-founders.<p>g.)It&#x27;s only Tuesday. Get moving and this done <i></i>before<i></i> the weekend.<p>3.) Debt: To any first time founders, please allocate budget to shutting down a business. Experience matters here, and it&#x27;s best practice to know your shutdown costs, to budget for them, and to have the professionalism to shut the business down when you have just enough money to close up shop. You should pay debts, invoices that are due, employee salaries, legal fees to shutdown, etc.<p>To the OP, create a list of assets/liabilities. If you can sell assets to pay for liabilities then do it. Be cool about who you owe money to. If these are other small businesses / startups, then try to make your debt whole.",1390951634

The public doesn&#x27;t seem to care when a company like Intel takes on a company like Fairchild Semiconductor.  Part of the issue is a lack of technical sophistication, so it is difficult to separate competitors based on their products.  The more important reason, though, is that technology devouring technology is easily understood as progress.  500 engineers lost their job at one firm, but a new firm is hiring 500.<p>Now take a look at the service disrupters like AirBnB, Uber, etc.  First, unlike technical disruption, the public understands the businesses here very well.  It&#x27;s a hotel.  It&#x27;s a taxi.  It&#x27;s a laundromat.  Second, there is a distinct feel that these new companies are not playing by the rules, whatever those rules might be (it doesn&#x27;t help that these companies publicly flaunt the rules either).  Third, and most importantly, there is far more perception of the people losing their jobs, rather than the gain these companies are making in terms of labor flexibility.<p>There are plenty of greenfield companies out there (Nest, DeepMind, Climate Corporation are acquisitions in the last month that come to mind).  But the region is not <i>exclusively</i> doing that kind of progress anymore, and so we shouldn&#x27;t be surprised when people aren&#x27;t immediately positive about the changes taking place anymore.",1390951618

I think Svbtle is great, but at the same time, how is it any different to that of other blog platforms that tout themselves as having a clean interface for writing content? We have Medium, Ghost, Tumblr and even Quora. The competitive edge that Svbtle had was its exclusivity, an edge they&#x27;ve now lost by opening it up.<p>I wasn&#x27;t attacking Dustin Curtis, I don&#x27;t know him, I know of him and I have no problem with him whatsoever. I think people are too quick when it comes to interpreting the intent of someone else&#x27;s words. But that&#x27;s understandable as gauging intent of words without the voice can be very difficult and easy to misinterpret, especially on the Internet and a site like Hacker News.<p>What I meant by elitist was a blogging platform that only allowed people that Dustin or whoever else hand-picked and determined were good enough to be allowed to use and publish on the Svbtle platform is in my opinion quite an elitist thing to do. &quot;I think you&#x27;re good enough to use my website&quot; it&#x27;s like a tech company like Apple choosing who gets to use their products and who doesn&#x27;t based on how they look or where they live.<p>At the same time, it&#x27;s Dustin&#x27;s right to choose who uses Svbtle, it was a unique take on blogging when it made its debut and its his darling. I won&#x27;t judge him for it, but I standby my choice of words calling his approach an elitist attitude. That&#x27;s just my opinion, don&#x27;t hate on me for it.<p>I haven&#x27;t used Svbtle long enough to form a substantial opinion as I already use Medium and am active on Quora, but what I&#x27;ve seen is quite nice. The interface is great, I&#x27;ve always been a fan of the overall aesthetic of the site from day one. I&#x27;ve got nothing bad to say about it. It&#x27;s just another blogging platform to me, a well-built one.<p>However, I don&#x27;t think Svbtle has any competitive edge left to compete with other established players in the competitive blogging platform niche.

And by &quot;true&quot;, I mean appropriate for the way that machine learning exists and operates in present-day space. Algorithms are difficult, temperamental and requires expert &quot;tuning&quot;.<p>The sequence seems to be:<p>- First you learn the formal theory, the math and statistics.<p>- Then you learn the &quot;squinting&quot;, the ad-hoc rules for how to apply which algorithm.<p>- Then implement the thing<p>This works better than just starting your editor and piecing code. However, I would claim that this doesn&#x27;t actually work <i>well</i> in the sense that this is kind of where AI/ML have bogged down. I mean, there are only 5 main approaches, 20 main algorithms and whatever subsidiaries and random stuff. They don&#x27;t work great and the only progress is incremental (though there is progress and throwing more computer power around at the same time enhances - while masking the low amount of conceptual progress).<p>What&#x27;s lacking is any modularity in combining algorithms. The power of ordinary programming is, essentially, using function calls to put together what you want. ML doesn&#x27;t do that and for all the magic, that makes it weak and fragile - when one magic algorithm doesn&#x27;t work well, rather than improving it, it really is better, at present, in the interest of getting stuff done, to start with a different magic algorithm. This is true, I&#x27;m a realistic in the sense of accepting the present but an idealist in the sense of saying &quot;that kind of sucks, we should be able to fix problems, not surrender and regroup&quot;.<p>Yes, I&#x27;m happy to denigrate the good and proper in my question for the best.

I even recommand it to learn the good parts of JS when you are completely unfamiliar with it.\nI think there is a lot more than synctactic sugar to Coffeescript. It makes obscur or verbose JS patterns really easy to use.\nMy code generally compiles down to up to twice as much JS code. Yes the compiler outputs somewhat verbose JS, but I can&#x27;t deny the speed and ease I&#x27;ve gain with it. And it is only my first professional project using it.",1390950624

Not everyone works just for money or to fill an some kind of an unhealthy addiction. Postdocs and graduate students often work a great deal harder for a lot less.<p>You&#x27;re also assuming an even more atomized society than anything Rand could imagine: most people understand that for them alone utility of wealth is a step function, they don&#x27;t need to be told that. Yet, they want their kids to attend good schools, which means means paying outlandish prices for a tiny home in a good school district (in most of Bay Area counties schools are assigned by residence) or even more for a private school. They also don&#x27;t want to jeopardize their families with the kind of pay-check to pay-check existence that leads to disaster when one of the dual earners loses their income. Is this morally right? No, Silicon Valley has deep housing problems (geography, failure to build upwards, zoning,  and other regulations) and the entire state&#x27;s education system is a nightmare. Yet as much as we&#x27;d like these problems to go away, this is the reality and we can&#x27;t avoid it for the time being.<p>It&#x27;s also great that folks like Bill Gates exist, for whom achievement is not a step function. As a Linux/BSD user I hated his guts as Microsoft CEO, but his non-profit work has been nothing short of amazing. He could have easily taken &quot;f u money&quot; decades ago and retired to a middle-class lifestyle with some angel investing on the side. Yet he amassed a fortune long after it ceased to bring him any _personal_ benefit: he chose to use it to pursue even more ambitious projects that benefit everyone.<p>I&#x27;m not in any way saying that private non-profits make government investment un-needed -- the Internet, immense achievements in aerospace, etc... are but a few examples of public sphere producing great things. Even Peter Thiel has admitted as much in recent interviews. Yet, public investment in hard problems is obviously not mutually exclusive with private enterprise either.",1390950237

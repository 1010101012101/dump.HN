But to make this problem worse, look at how some animals mate.  If you were to only allow peaceful instances, the species would be extinct in three generations.

It didn&#x27;t do the kind of improvements that take fiscal policy to do -- because it wasn&#x27;t fiscal policy -- which isn&#x27;t a difference of degree of magnitude, but kind.<p>> I find arguments about how it wasn&#x27;t big enough to be null, because it isn&#x27;t clear that we could have afforded much more<p>The only arguments I&#x27;ve seen about insufficient quantity of stimulus have been about the government (not Fed) fiscal stimulus of 2009 (ARRA and related bills). Given the low price of government borrowing, its quite obvious that we could have spent a lot more in (and since) 2009 on fiscal stimulus; the reason we didn&#x27;t is political, not available-resources driven.<p>But that&#x27;s a whole different thing than the Feds monetary stimulus.<p>> It&#x27;s been 8 years now we&#x27;ve been on this policy.<p>What policy, exactly? Most of the Feds particularly intense monetary stimulus finished several years ago and has been in winding-down/settlement for the last few years, ditto with fiscal stimulus under ARRA. And 8 years ago (early 2008) was <i>before</i> the crisis and stimulus responses; if you are talking about the stimulus -- both monetary and fiscal -- adopted in response to the 2008/9 crisis, it started <i>less</i> than 8 years ago, and the intense policy ended several years ago, so in no sense have we been on a common stimulus policy for eight years.<p>> Nobody 8 years ago would have predicted what happened.<p>Both Austrians and Keynesians (among others) predicted that the actual stimulus that was engaged in by the Fed and government would fail to achieve what people wanted from stimulus (for, naturally, radically different reasons). To say that no one predicted the failure of the stimulus that was adopted is, simply, incorrect.",1454443042

Decoupling may not solve this &quot;problem&quot; (if you consider this a problem), but it also does not create another one. It simply makes it more flexible so people who could not afford the education process for any reason, but were able to educate themselves by alternatives means, can also try to get certified in the level they wish. Also, the possibility of being certified by top tier certification emitters works as another motivator for people to strain and study harder (as going to top universities is not even remotely possible for most people, at least being certified by top certificate emitting institutes is probably less expensive (given the educational process is the more expensive one), and thus possible).<p>In other words, I believe you are right when you point that the educational institutes would narrow their focus to cover only the necessary bits to get certified, but I don&#x27;t see this getting much far from what we have already; and from the point of view of the certificate emitting institute, it is desirable for the top ones to not emit certificates to anyone (in order to build a valuable brand name), having them to focus on elaborating challenging tests. Of course there may be &quot;certificate mills&quot;, but again, this already happens, just with less flexibility.<p>What really picks me is that, at the end, it is all about the value people give to these certificates. Nothing would prevent society (including employers) to value more the educational process than the testing one; nothing would prevent the educational institutes to also emit certificates, thus coming back to where we are; but employers should not rely purely on certificates anyway, then I believe there is hope for the overall proposed model.",1454442468

As long as everything is given away for free and there are no barriers to entry, you&#x27;ll keep ending up with chaos and unmanageable churn whereby your job as a software developer has now morphed into a software tester/evaluator for every single piece of functionality that you need and don&#x27;t want to write yourself.<p>When you have to actually put your money on the line and have an actual business presence on the web, it&#x27;s a completely different mindset from &quot;I&#x27;m going to write this small library and pop it up on GitHub for free, so who cares if there&#x27;s documentation or if the software even works as described&quot;.  The fact that there <i>are</i> developers that are professional and thorough and <i>still</i> give away their software is a minor miracle.  But, it&#x27;s not wise to count on the charity of such developers for the long-term because it isn&#x27;t realistic.  As more and more one-offs are created, it becomes much harder to distinguish one&#x27;s software from the rest of the pack, so developers will simply not even attempt to do so.  The Apple store is a perfect example of this problem.",1454442199

The interest rate is payed BY the government to the holders of the treasury security.<p>This is loan the government takes to pay for its expenses. The interest rate the government pays on these securities is determined by the FED, and it is one powerful weapon to regulate an economy. The government is the lowest risk debtor in a country, so anybody who wants borrow must pay more than what the government does. If the FED raises the rate, the rest of the economy follows, financing goods and investing get harder, but inflation tends to recede. The opposite happens when the rate is lowered.<p>If the government pays negative rates on its securities, the banks have to pay TO the government in order to keep money invested in securities. The effect is that the government&#x27;s debt will decrease, money will flood the market, possibly resulting in a bit of inflation, but maybe kickstarting the economy (and your student loan rates might get lower, if they are not regulated and/or subsidized, which I&#x27;m not of sure since I don&#x27;t live in the US).",1454442174

What we discovered in the 70s is that you don&#x27;t need to have human-level evaluation to win at chess; it is enough to count material and piece activity, plus some heuristics (pawn structure, king safety...); computers more than compensate this weakness with their superhuman tree exploration.<p>This approach never worked so well for Go because evaluation was a mystery: which group is weak or strong? how much territory will their power yield? These are questions that professionals answer intuitively according to their experience. With so many parts of the board that depend on each other, we don&#x27;t know how to solve the equation.<p>It looks like AlphaGo is the first one to get this evaluation right. At the end of the game, his groups are still alive and they control more territory. So Go evaluation is yet another task that used to be reserved to human experts and that computers now master. The fact that this is mixed with classical tree search does not make it less impressive.",1454441315

Perhaps someone harmed you in the past but is no longer trying to harm you. Is that still an enemy? What about someone who is conspiring to harm you, but you don&#x27;t yet know about the danger. Is that an enemy yet? Another detail to consider is whether a mere competitor, for example an opposing sports team, is an &quot;enemy&quot;. The case of intense dislike also possesses some of these specifics.<p>Edit: Another very important consideration is those who, while not actually trying to harm you, do so indirectly by exploiting you or otherwise trying to control you for their benefit.

By including this long-term negative interest rate scenario in its 2016 stress tests, it is basically admitting that there is some non-negligible probability that it will be unable to follow through on this commitment, and that banks should be prepared to weather the storm if and when it completely loses control of its grip over the direction of the short term interest rate.<p>The article does not actually speculate on what might happen if the Fed were to reverse its rate hike and instead lower the FFR into negative territory. I&#x27;d imagine that basically nothing would change, and that the banks would simply take a 0.25% haircut on their holdings of 3-month treasury bonds as they have been doing in Europe for the past 1.5 years. They will not pass this negative interest rate onto regular customers as this would either (a) drive them to another bank which would benefit from the new deposits or (b) force consumers to withdraw deposits and hold cash instead. Banks need these deposits to loan against, and a 0.25% &quot;holding tax&quot; on a relatively small portion of their holdings would not justify the loss in deposits. Banks will just eat the hit to their profit margins and life will go on  as normal in the supply side of money world.",1454440534

However, the oil companies came through and leased tons of acreage already and spent lots of money on the leases. Even if prices come back, many of the leases would have either expired or the gas companies would have to pay for their extension provisions. Given the state of the companies that started leasing (CHK: down 86% since they leased my father-in-laws old farm property), I don&#x27;t think they have the money to do that.

I suppose my answer is that I can&#x27;t imagine how much &#x27;demand&#x27; there would be if average wage growth kept up with productivity, largely because the economy is a complicated beast, and &#x27;demand&#x27; is not a simple thing.",1454439850

11021587,comment,11017587,11017587,0,0,haberman,,,"In my experience some aspects of the JavaScript experience are <i>great</i>, and others are <i>terrible</i>.<p>npm is <i>great</i>.  It gives you an easy way of specifying your dependencies in your source tree, and makes it extremely easy for people who check out your repo to obtain them.  People can run &quot;npm install&quot; and now they have a copy of all your dependencies in &quot;./node_modules&quot;.  It composes nicely too: &quot;npm install&quot; also pulls the dependencies of your dependencies.<p>Babel is <i>great</i>.  Sure, I&#x27;ve heard some complaints lately about their latest changes, but so far this hasn&#x27;t affected me as a user.  Babel for me means that I get to write using the most modern ES6/ES7 features and then compile to ES5 for compatibility.  For me it works great and mostly hassle free.<p>The frameworks themselves are <i>great</i>.  Not perfect sure, but there are lots of great ideas floating around in React, Angular, d3, moment.js, etc. and the packages built on top of them.  Whatever you want to do there is a library out there that someone has put a lot of love into.  There is a lot of choice -- yes, maybe sometimes a little bit too much, but I&#x27;d rather have that than too little.<p>Flow is <i>great</i> (and I hear TypeScript is too, and getting better).  I can&#x27;t tell you how nice it is to be able to declare static types when you want to and hear about type errors at compile time.  Maybe not everybody&#x27;s cup of tea, but I love it.<p>The build systems, minifiers, test runners, etc. are <i>terrible</i>.  By far the worst part of JS development for me is figuring out how to glue it all together.  When I try to figure it out it&#x27;s like entering an infinitely complex maze where none of the passages actually lead anywhere.<p>--<p>For example, let&#x27;s say you want to run some Jasmine tests under PhantomJS.  Jasmine is a popular unit testing framework and PhantomJS is a popular headless browser, scriptable using JavaScript.  Both very cool technologies, but how can you use them together?  This is a real example: it&#x27;s something I really wanted to do, but in the end I literally could not figure out how and gave up.<p>Phantom JS claims that it supports Jasmine (<a href=""http://phantomjs.org/headless-testing.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://phantomjs.org/headless-testing.html</a>) though it gives several options for test runners: Chutzpah, grunt-contrib-jasmine, guard-jasmine, phantom-jasmine. Time to enter the maze!<p>Chutzpah looks promising (<a href=""http://mmanela.github.io/chutzpah/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://mmanela.github.io/chutzpah/</a>) -- it says it lets you run tests under a command line.  It says it &quot;supports the QUnit, Jasmine and Mocha testing frameworks&quot; and you can get it by using &quot;nuget or chocolatey&quot;.  Dig a little deeper and it starts to become clear that this is a very Windows-centric tool -- nuget says it requires Visual Studio and chocolatey is Windows-only.  Our maze has run into a dead-end.<p>Moving on to grunt-contrib-jasmine.  I don&#x27;t <i>really</i> want to use this because I&#x27;m currently using Gulp (Grunt&#x27;s competitor), but let&#x27;s check it out.  We end up at this page (<a href=""https://github.com/gruntjs/grunt-contrib-jasmine"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/gruntjs/grunt-contrib-jasmine</a>).  This page is sort of a quintessential &quot;JavaScript maze&quot;.  It contains a lot of under-explained jargon and links to other plugins.  And it gives me no idea how to do basic things like &quot;include all my node_modules&quot; (maybe I should list each ./node_module/foo dir explicitly under &quot;vendor&quot;?)<p>Moving on to guard-jasmine, I end up at <a href=""https://github.com/guard/guard-jasmine"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/guard/guard-jasmine</a>, and it&#x27;s clear now that I&#x27;ve entered a Ruby neighborhood of the maze: everything is talking about the &quot;Rails asset pipeline&quot;, adding Guard into &quot;your Gemfile&quot; (I don&#x27;t have a Gemfile!!).  I really don&#x27;t want to introduce a Ruby dependency into my build just for the privilege of gluing two JavaScript technologies together (Jasmine and PhantomJS).<p>The final option in the list was phantom-jasmine, bringing us here: <a href=""https://github.com/jcarver989/phantom-jasmine"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/jcarver989/phantom-jasmine</a>.  It&#x27;s been a while so I don&#x27;t remember everything I went through trying to make this work.  But I was ultimately unsuccessful.",1454439714

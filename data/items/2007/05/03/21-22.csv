19118,comment,18956,19046,0,0,Tichy,,,"I'd like to think there is. How did the Palm Pilot homepage fare, anyway, they used to sell serious applications for Palm Pilots?<p>At least in Germany the established players seem to have a firm believe that the only ways to make serious money are through excessive TV advertising and abo schemes, or to be on the WAP pages of the actual carriers. There must be a huge untapped market out there, though - I don't know anybody who ever surfed their carriers WAP pages.<p>I am currently setting up a dedicated homepage for my mobile phone application, hoping to tap some other channels. I guess I will report back to YC news in a few weeks about it's success or failure.",1178229263

You should be able to browse your voicemail like text messages, listen to them instantly or delete them. Is something like that even possible?",1178229115

19114,comment,19061,19064,0,0,Tichy,,,"I think that post didn't explicitly mention IPTV, though? More likely, people download their favourite TV series via bittorrent. And that would be the less lazy people, who are motivated to find the TV show on the web, and watch it in original language.<p>Here in germany we see a lot of clones of successful concepts from the US. Today I saw an ad for a new phone which comes bundled with something called wubbler (or something like that, can't remember). I bet that's a Twitter clone...",1178228911
19113,comment,19050,19075,0,0,Tichy,,,"Good point about the carriers controlling everything. But will they really be able to keep it up? Suppose an internet provider wanted to block certain services, for example, they could try to force you to use their house search engine instead of Google. It seems likely that people would avoid that internet provider. <p>The problem with mobile carriers is I think that people are not aware of what they should expect - they are not aware that they are denied the functionality ""X"", so they are not complaining to the carriers. But suppose one of the carriers would block for example Twitter, wouldn't people start to notice?",1178228569

As languages proliferate and integration between web apps gets more common, I think moving along the user-developer continuum will get easier.",1178228088

In my own experience, I discover good ideas by talking about them with other men, but I refine the idea and work out all the details by talking about them with the women in my life (mom and girlfriend).  If I get the woman's approval, I know it's a good one ;)\n",1178227513

My friend tried to buy one but he said that lead time estimates were huge and suspected that they were out of inventory. All makes sense now with the Nexus 5 launch.<p>In hindsight, I have to suspect that Google and LG&#x27;s plans all along was to create a phone with high specs at a low price point but restrict the supply as they &quot;learned&quot; to lower costs for their subsequent models. We&#x27;ve suspected that the Nexus 4 was most likely a loss making model for LG, but since they were rapidly losing mindshare, a loss making low&#x27;ish volume high end phone was something they were probably willing to stomach to partner with Google to get back in consumers&#x27; minds.<p>Maybe they&#x27;ll be making profit from day 1 on the Nexus 5 this year",1383436799

Perhaps this effort didn&#x27;t begin <i>that</i> far back, but certainly since the mid 80s or early 90s, at a point where internet started crossing the critical threshold from hobbyist or military interests, to everyday/commerce interests. Certainly, nobody could have predicted how popular the internet would become, but once its potential became clear I can only imagine how irresistible the opportunity for its control would have been.<p>The more I think about the current state of affairs, the more I understand now why the Chinese government has resisted efforts by foreign data providers to become primary providers, and instead creating their own versions - it seems they had the foresight that none of us (engineers) had. They smartly created their own search engines and social networks to stop/limit the funneling of their data to foreign companies with the side-benefit of having near-full control over domestic data.",1383436682

6661404,comment,6654905,6658344,2,0,anl,,,"Note about general concept: it&#x27;s not about saving face; it&#x27;s more about losing face (for yourself or others). &quot;Saving face&quot; has selfish and individualistic connotations, and implies actively maintaining one&#x27;s face or ego. That&#x27;s not the point of the concept, and people don&#x27;t try to maintain face or their ego. Losing is more significant than saving or gaining.<p>And it&#x27;s not about trying to prevent loss of face, it&#x27;s about the act of losing face. You don&#x27;t actively try to maintain face. You only criticize and say something about losing face when you actually do because it&#x27;s not a good thing to lose face, and generally people don&#x27;t lose face (if they are competent or do things right). So when you do mess up, that&#x27;s when you say you lost face.<p>And also, if one thinks that [Japanese](substitute for any other) society is all about saving face or ego, then that&#x27;s a wrong conception. People (everywhere) don&#x27;t really think about losing face or maintaining ego anyways. If everyone did, then societies would be quite narcissistic and self-interested, and that&#x27;s not the case. The concept is only invoked when someone loses face. That&#x27;s it.",1383436421

As for the others you mention, I have no information about their surveillance program. But you are right, my use of &quot;Western&quot; was inappropriate. I should have said &quot;country with a functional democracy&quot; instead. But essentially, if you don&#x27;t already have separation of powers, an independent judiciary and the sort of check and balances which are typical of democracies, you are going to get mass surveillance anyway, as long as the tech level is sufficient, because there is no reason for an authoritarian regime not to do. Mass surveillance is a feature of authoritarian regimes (see 1984 or what the Stasi tried to do).

Raw language speed is an important factor to consider but for some projects language syntax, community, ecosystem and libraries are much more significant. Those are python strong aspects. Due to its simple syntax, Python is very popular at mooc platforms, such as Coursera, edX and Udacity. Really lots of very good educational content and I mean MIT level good.<p>2. Usually web projects do not need to scale that much. Website traffic distribution follows power law so if you do not expect your project to be in top 1%, Django will usually handle all standard CRUD workloads.<p>3.

It requires non-trivial engineering work to integrate (you are, after all, proposing an API) and often doesn&#x27;t obviously make them money.  Talk to me or anybody who runs an analytics company privately if you want to hear some stories about where the typical well-run software company is in terms of using analytics.  You may find that complex power-tools are not exactly what the market wants at the moment.<p>3)  Are you good at B2B sales?  This isn&#x27;t a ginormous market at the moment, such that you can easily get to $10k a month in revenue by signing up 500 companies at $20 a month.

Many companies in the space are similarly trying to move upmarket.<p>In the direct B2B &quot;dialing for dollars&quot; that you&#x27;ll be doing, prepare to answer questions such as &quot;Why should I use you, who I&#x27;ve never heard of, when I could use the folks who invented the category <i>for free</i> or I can go with the thought leaders in the space and be sure not to get fired for losing all of our data?&quot;<p>4)  Analytics is a hard product to build, technically.

It is a space in which it is easy to ship something which hits every bullet on the design document and yet produces absolutely no value for customers.<p>Don&#x27;t get me wrong, people have succeeded with it.  Paras Chopra came to me back in the day with an analytics startup that tried to be everything for everybody.  It included an A/B testing module.

Mostly core OS and system with standard same local copies of data tables?<p>With that you can work out what you are trying to do form a need perspective.  May be case of local imaging servers and doing differential backups automated.  But if compression and duplication are not the case and/or high frequency of data then you will not be able to fit that data into a smaller area.  You may only get 2:1 or less  compression it is realy data centric and you need at least 4:1 and actualy better on all that data.<p>Look into the problem and define it better, with that a solution will be easier and may be case of proving that you can not do what you need may even need 400TB to back up those 200TB servers due to high volume data changes and need to be able to go back more than the last backup copy and may need to go back a month.  Define the buisness needs, impact and with that the cost and budget as this is very much a case of working to a limitation when that limitation is not defined and may well be articifical and defeating in the objective to a cost that exceeds just adding more storage.<p>In short, define the problem better with regards to data and busness needs for backup -- hourly/realtime daily weekly and the type of data and how dynamic that data is.  May be case of easy to do as realy only 1TB of data that changes across all servers each week, just do not know.<p>Then do not go about doing yoru own backup solution from scratch, as something to replace what you have worth a look if you realy know what you are doing and you may not. But do not reinvent wheels, many options/solution out there but until the true problem is defined then no easly solution can be given.<p>Heck do not even know if these are Windows, Linux, AIX, BSD or a combination of different servers and with that the options change.  ALso factor in offsite aspect of backup as one electrical zapping from a storm or a fire could mess things up if that backupserver is sat next too the servers it is backing up.  So many things to consider but above all sit down and define the problem in more detail as sadly the devil is always in the detail and better definition of the problem allows for easier solutions and over all less work as well as smarter work.

That&#x27;s why, for example, congress called the FBI Director to question regarding the Boston Marathon bombings, not the NSA Director[1].  The NSA would only be able to help with terrorist attacks against the US planned by international terrorist groups or terrorist attacks purely directed overseas.  That&#x27;s not to say that US targeting of foreign terrorist threats doesn&#x27;t have a purpose.  We have lots of diplomats, soldiers, etc. serving overseas, not to mention aiding foreign partners.<p>I think the terrorism card has been played a bit too much by the administration.  Yes, there is a threat, but it&#x27;s much more of a threat to embassy staff and military overseas than ordinary Americans.  I think it&#x27;s used as justification because it&#x27;s easier for Americans to see terrorists as threatening after the 9/11 attacks.  It&#x27;s harder for the average American to feel threatened by foreign spies and state-sponsored hackers, or see the value in spying on foreign government officials.<p>The parties who stand to benefit from cutting back NSA spying are the people who are targeted by it.  Most of the articles that come out just show how the NSA is conducting their collection and then pass on assumptions that they must be targeting everyone.  The NYT article we&#x27;re discussing today actually goes into some detail on who they&#x27;re targeting.  Any tradeoff discussion needs to focus what they&#x27;re actually doing and whether or not the US would be better without it.  The problem of who they <i>could</i> be targeting can be dealt with using proper oversight and legal frameworks - we have an armed police force but don&#x27;t live in fear of random officers breaking into our homes and gunning down our families.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/08/01/fbi-prevent-boston-bombing-marthon-attack_n_3691819.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/08/01/fbi-prevent-boston-...</a>",1383435094

Why?<p>1. It&#x27;s full of little cargo cults powered by Greg Young, Udi Dahan and Oren Eini in particular. Each of these sells snake oil that costs you piles of cash and screws up your architecture or heavily couples it into a product which has a recurring cost.<p>2. Rip off merchants such as Telerik producing buggy components that rarely work.<p>3. Abandonware galore. There is no inertia. Everything tails off and dies after a bit. You can&#x27;t drag something off NuGet without the inevitable result of it dying miserably after a year or so. At least we have NuGet now so ancient versions don&#x27;t just disappear. We have to maintain our own forks of various things now.<p>4. Framework circle-jerking. Microsoft literally suck up to every framework that appears that gets traction resulting in much friction for those who adopted other frameworks before the circle-jerk began because it&#x27;s not the one true framework (MVC validation I&#x27;m looking at you).<p>5. Everyone you get off the street is rubbish, at least in the UK. I mean really rubbish. So rubbish even though we offer a damn high salary, we have a 1 in 20 hit rate for staff. Perhaps 1 in 50 people actually give a crap past getting a pay cheque. It seriously attracts the wrong people.<p>6. Blindness. Not a single person I know has even managed to take a look at other platforms past perhaps owning an iOS or Android phone. There is literally no variation of knowledge or alternative viewpoint to pit the status quo against.<p>It&#x27;s just a career programming market if you ask me and to be honest it&#x27;s the only reason I do it.

Heads were banged together over that one. Sinofsky was blatantly behind it, that&#x27;s why he got sacked. It wasn&#x27;t about Windows 8 not being a good product (it was). It was because he was running the show like Steve Jobs did in the 80s; actively fostering mistrust between teams and undermining intra-division communication and respect.<p>I don&#x27;t think the Windows division will ever fully respect .NET for what it is until some of the old guard have moved on.

Immediate problem was that my login information wound up permanently entered in one of my credit card sites; it was an auto-login I could not disable. So if someone DID steal my laptop, it would be a happy time for him. Trashing Dashlane had no effect; I had to do a force quit of the Dashlane agent using Activity Monitor, then trash it and other attendant files. So many of these password managers, including the incredibly wonderful 1Password that everyone swoons over, imbed themselves so deeply into browsers and other functions that I don&#x27;t trust them. I will stick with Password Wallet, which sits isolated off to the side and doesn&#x27;t try to do too much.

For example, the reason Android is open-source is because it would be hard to convince a broad base of hardware partners to support it if were closed-source (and now that one particular hardware partner is starting to dominate, it&#x27;s getting more closed-source).  Webkit is open-source because it started as open-source, and yet it is strategically important to Apple, Google, and Opera (well, until the Blink fork, but Blink is also open-source because it was derived from Webkit).  Linux is strategically important to IBM, RedHat, etc. because they sell enterprise consulting services; having the source code available gives businesses confidence that they can continue running even if the vendor goes out of business, and yet they still drop a lot of money on consulting services.<p>It generally does not work to start a company based on open-source principles without also thinking about the strategic implications of who else will use the technology and what incentive they have for keeping it open.  For example, LiveJournal was based on open-source principles and developed MogileFS, memcached, Gearman, and LJ itself.  The effect of this was that every time they did something wrong, someone would start a clone of LJ and a clump of users would move over.  And then Facebook took memcached and used it as a core part of their architecture, and won the whole social networking space.",1383433766

That is, someone else compiled it and you are trusting that what it will do (or initiate, via init, for example) when you boot it is acceptable.  My guess is most Linux users do not compile their own kernels.<p>Perhaps the problem here is not that these project &quot;developers&quot; are suggesting that others pipe unread scripts into /bin/sh, it&#x27;s that too often these &quot;developers&quot;, or the others on the receiving end of their scripts, have a poor understanding of shell scripting.<p>I find in the majority of cases where someone wants me to run their shell script, I could do what needs to be done without using the script or rewrite the script myself, using a minimal POSIX-like shell instead of bash or ksh, and reducing script size by 90% or a similarly large percentage.  Then there&#x27;s the minority of cases where I actually admire the care that the script author took to make the script efficient and portable, or where I actually learn something new by reading the script.  That happens all too rarely.<p>While I&#x27;m on the topic of shell scripting, I&#x27;ll add that I do a lot of shell scripting for my own personal use.

I have no need for uppercase variable names; they only slow me down.<p>I note that djb also writes his shell scripts in lowercase.

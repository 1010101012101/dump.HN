The fact that it knows a lot about the code is invaluable sometimes - auto-importing package names as you type, fixing build rules in other files automatically, code completion, type-definitions that appear with inline usage notes, etc. Granted, enterprise Java in a build environment is the ideal use case for an IDE, but many of those features are useful <i>all the time.</i>  Now when I write other code, it feels somewhat archaic that my text editor of choice isn&#x27;t giving me function docs/typedefs and managing dependencies as I write.<p>As much as I despise the text editor in Eclipse, living without those things is basically impossible. I have &quot;solved&quot; this problem by constantly switching contexts between my editor of choice and Eclipse, whenever I need to do something crafty.

However, if you dig deeper a different message emerges... imagine every worker was on flexitime, and could choose how much or little they worked so long as they got their tasks done, companies would start expecting more and more tasks to be done right? The blame for this isn&#x27;t solely with the employer, whilst they might be partly motivated by greed, there is also the issue of competition, and as a general rule the more competitive a market is, the fewer resources are directly available to a company, and the fewer resources available the more demands are going to be placed on the worker.<p>Imagine what work would be like if we didn&#x27;t need to compete in order to earn a living.

Half my commute is caused by waiting on a major road for one car to pull out of a tiny street.<p>This is a slightly more nuclear option, but a fleet of self-driving cars operated by a third party (like Uber or Lyft etc) could hit the problem at its main cause - too many cars on the road. Most cars spend the majority of their time motionless, if the ownership model changed, the the cars in use could operate nearly all the time, driving directly from one pickup to the next. This could significantly reduce the number of cars required, removing all need for street parking and freeing up the majority of off-street parking.<p>Less cars on the streets = wider city streets for free, and self-driving cars could more efficiently use that extra space. There would be other side effects too - coordinating carpools would be relatively trivial, and people wouldn&#x27;t have to worry letting strangers into their personal vehicles. The freeways could operate at higher speeds with significantly less follow space and lower friction at interchanges. Routing optimizations (like what you describe in #1) could be implemented at large scale, and the whole grid could effectively be load-balanced.<p>Some people will still probably want control over their vehicle; individuals could still own private cars alongside the shared model. Those cars would just be like private autonomous limos. This option could let people who could afford it use their car as a private office during the commute, without having to take all of their things out after every use. Families could more effectively share a single vehicle, because it could drive back home after the daily commute. I&#x27;d imagine that most consumers would opt for low cost and no ownership risk over that convenience.",1440235410

10102003,comment,10097542,10101609,0,0,nitrogen,,,"Perhaps there&#x27;s a difference in intensity and duration.<p>Wikipedia indicates[0] that an EMP could generate 50kV/m electric fields lasting ~1μs, a second component similar to lightning lasting ~1s (electric field intensity not listed), and a third, long-term component that lasts hundreds of seconds.<p>CMEs, it appears, only generate the third, long-lasting type of electric disturbance.  According to NASA[1], these have electric fields up to 26V/km, which is a much lower intensity, but for a significantly longer duration.<p>[someone please check my numbers; they seem wrong but I&#x27;m posting them anyway; my guess is misinterpreting electric field potential as actual induced voltage]<p>To estimate how much power would be dissipated in transmission lines, let&#x27;s consider a disconnected 1km wire with a DC resistance of 30 milliohms per kilometer (based on [2]) and ignore all other losses.  The so-called E1 pulse at 50kV/m would generate a voltage of 50MV across the wire.  Let&#x27;s assume that lasts 200ns.  Power is V^2/R, or (50MV)^2/30mohms=83.33petawatts [3].<p>That sounds enormous, but it&#x27;s for a short time.  Energy is P<i>t, or 83.33PW</i>200ns=16.7GJ.  To find out how much the wire heats up, let&#x27;s assume a perfectly straight copper conductor 2cm in diameter.  That&#x27;s a volume of 1km<i>pi</i>(1cm)^2=1.257m^3 or a mass of 2815kg[4].  Taking energy/(specific heat * mass), we get a temperature rise of 15410K[5].  Copper melts at 1357K, so <i>if</i> the math is right that transmission line would be toast.  These numbers seem way too large.<p>An E3-type pulse from a CME lasting 1000 seconds would generate up to 26kV across the length of wire.  That&#x27;s (26kV)^2/30mohms=22.5GW.  Over 1000 seconds that generates 22.5terajoules[6].  I&#x27;m not even going to bother calculating a temperature rise for that (okay, it&#x27;s 20.8 million K[7]).  Again, this seems several orders of magnitude off.<p>I&#x27;ve ignored capacitance, inductance, increased resistance with temperature (up to 170milliohms if I used [8] correctly), and no doubt a lot of other things that would significantly affect the current flow, so keep in mind that these numbers are probably way off.  I&#x27;ve also ignored heat dissipation to the air, which would mitigate the energy input a bit but also keep the resistance lower.  I welcome any corrections.<p>Assuming these numbers are completely bogus, it seems to me that an EMP would be more damaging to small electronics, while the CME would be more dangerous for transmission infrastructure.<p>----<p>[0] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_electromagnetic_pulse#Characteristics_of_nuclear_EMP"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_electromagnetic_pulse#...</a><p>[1] <a href=""http://svs.gsfc.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/details.cgi?aid=4189"" rel=""nofollow"">http://svs.gsfc.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/details.cgi?aid=4189</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://large.stanford.edu/courses/2010/ph240/harting1/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://large.stanford.edu/courses/2010/ph240/harting1/</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=%2850MV%29^2%2F30mohms"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=%2850MV%29^2%2F30mohms</a><p>[4] <a href=""http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=1km*pi*%281cm%29^2+*+density+of+copper"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=1km*pi*%281cm%29^2+*+de...</a><p>[5] <a href=""http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=16.67GJ+%2F+%28specific+heat+of+copper%29+%2F+%281km*pi*%281cm%29^2+*+density+of+copper%29"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=16.67GJ+%2F+%28specific...</a><p>[6] <a href=""http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=%2826kV%29^2%2F30mohms"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=%2826kV%29^2%2F30mohms</a><p>[7] <a href=""http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=%2826kV%29^2%2F30mohms+*+1000s+in+terajoules+%2F+%28specific+heat+of+copper%29+%2F+%281km*pi*%281cm%29^2+*+density+of+copper%29"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=%2826kV%29^2%2F30mohms+...</a><p>[8] <a href=""http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/electric/restmp.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/electric/restmp.h...</a>",1440234297

10101994,comment,10100932,10101250,0,0,DonHopkins,,,"You make an important point about the distinction between control flow and data flow. They can both co-exist in a visual programming languages, but many VPLs tend to focus on one or the other.<p>Grasshopper [1] is very data flow oriented and functional, so you can program loops implicitly by flowing arrays, arrays of arrays, and trees along the wires, and the nodes know how to implicitly iterate over their inputs.<p>SimAntics (the visual programming language in The Sims) [2] (and I presume Dracon, but I haven&#x27;t programmed in it) is very control flow oriented and imperative, almost like visual assembly language, and there is an implicit state (like a set of registers or local variables) that travels along with the program counter that flows along the lines between nodes.<p>A data flow switching &quot;if&quot; statement can be embodied in a data flow programming language as a node that takes three inputs: Condition, A and B, and outputs A if Condition is true, or B if Condition is false. Like &quot;Condition ? A : B&quot;.<p>Or a control flow branching &quot;if&quot; statement can be embodied in a control flow programming language as a node that takes one input: a Condition (or it is activated by a flow of control input and the node contains a condition to evaluate against the VM state, like a flow chart branch node), and outputs the flow of control to A if the condition is true, or B if the condition is false (the road not taken). Like &quot;if Condition goto A else goto B&quot;.<p>Some languages have a mix of both. Body Electric (aka Bounce) [3] is a real time data flow oriented visual programming language used for VR simulations, that primarily uses data flow switching &quot;if&quot; statements. The order of execution of the nodes is implicitly determined by a partial ordering of their dependency graph, and each node has an optional explicit &quot;enable&quot; input and output that you can use to turn on and off the execution of any node (behaving like an on-off switch type of &quot;if&quot; statement), and explicitly wire up the dependencies to control the order of execution (if the order of side effects is important, like for drawing commands).<p>Grasshopper is a good example of a successful data flow oriented visual programming language, with an excellent user interface, and a vast library of powerful features that elegantly dovetail together. I&#x27;m working on a project that uses Grasshopper for 3d printing houses. [4]<p>I&#x27;d caution against casually projecting anything you know about one visual programming language (like &quot;it sucks&quot; or &quot;it rocks&quot;) onto any other visual programming language (and especially all other visual programming languages), because they can be EXTREMELY different! (Just like text programming languages.) And a lot of it boils down to ergonomics and user interface design, as well as the vocabulary of built-in primitives and libraries and abstraction mechanisms.<p>[1] <a href=""http://vimeopro.com/rhino/grasshopper-getting-started-by-david-rutten"" rel=""nofollow"">http://vimeopro.com/rhino/grasshopper-getting-started-by-dav...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://donhopkins.com/home/movies/TheSimsPieMenus.mov"" rel=""nofollow"">http://donhopkins.com/home/movies/TheSimsPieMenus.mov</a> and <a href=""http://simswiki.info/wiki.php?title=SimAntics"" rel=""nofollow"">http://simswiki.info/wiki.php?title=SimAntics</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://www.art.net/~hopkins/Don/lang/bounce/bounce.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.art.net/~hopkins/Don/lang/bounce/bounce.html</a> and <a href=""http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?BounceLanguage"" rel=""nofollow"">http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?BounceLanguage</a> and <a href=""http://www.jaronlanier.com/vpl.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.jaronlanier.com/vpl.html</a> and <a href=""http://www.jaronlanier.com/instruments.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.jaronlanier.com/instruments.html</a><p>[4] <a href=""http://3dprintcanalhouse.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://3dprintcanalhouse.com/</a> and this screenshot <a href=""http://imgur.com/avYXU6Y"" rel=""nofollow"">http://imgur.com/avYXU6Y</a> from this video <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TAoW1iA385w"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TAoW1iA385w</a>",1440234187

8009628,comment,8009529,8009529,14,0,brinker,,,"The rise of gluten-free dieting as a fad has some interesting effects for people who actually have celiac disease or gluten sensitivity. On the one hand, increased awareness has made gluten-free food more available, on the other, the stigma against people eating gluten-free has risen. So people who have an actual medical reason not to eat gluten get lumped into a fad diet group.<p>I have a friend with Hashimoto&#x27;s Thyroiditis. In recent years several studies have found a potential connection between Hashimoto&#x27;s and celiac disease (it is still being actively studied, and the link is not conclusive), and so some doctors are beginning to suggest that people with Hashimoto&#x27;s remove gluten from their diet. My friend did, and sure enough saw some thyroid improvement afterward. She is now entirely gluten free (and has been for over a year), and is often irritated at people judging or questioning her gluten-free diet because they immediately assume it is nothing more than capitulation to an idiotic fad.",1404914361

It&#x27;s not a function, it&#x27;s a value just like any other list of integers.<p>You obviously can&#x27;t do something like that in C++ or most other languages. I think that&#x27;s a pretty good example to demonstrate the difference between a pure and lazy language like Haskell and the more mainstream kind of languages.<p>If you&#x27;re primarily a C++ programmer, Haskell should feel alien to you. It&#x27;s a good thing. The differences in syntax are only skin deep, the differences in the semantics is what is interesting.",1404914356

No one is forcing anyone to go gluten free.<p>I had dinner last night with friends, one of who has had really bad allergies for many years. Really bad. Starting a year ago, her doctor started removing things from her environment to see what might be causing the problem. You guessed it: when gluten was removed from her diet her allergies cleared up within a month.<p>My wife and I eat mostly gluten free because we believe that modern wheat (which is really a different food now) causes inflammation in some people. I spend zero time trying to get anyone else to go gluten free, because except for my family I don&#x27;t much care what other people eat.<p>So, if you like wheat products, enjoy!<p>BTW, you have not seen the new documentary &quot;Fed Up&quot; about the food industry then please do so. This is the movie the food industry (super powerful lobby in the USA, probably even more clout than the defense industry) does not want to see, so you may have to exert extra effort to find it playing.",1404914325

8009623,comment,8008843,8008843,4,0,chipgap98,,,"The author misses the point of who AA is intended for. Not every person who goes through a period of overindulgent drinking is an alcoholic. Many college students in the US drink like alcoholics and, like the article says, 75% of binge drinkers cut way back when they get more responsibility. AA, in my opinion, is meant for those other 25%. AA is for the people who have a serious job, a family, or other responsibility and don&#x27;t slow down.<p>There are people who hit rock bottom from drinking and realize they need help. For them the thought of getting back to that rock bottom point can be terrifying. Abstinence only isn&#x27;t forced upon them, but rather it can be viewed as the only option.<p>This article also doesn&#x27;t do anything to address drug addiction. I don&#x27;t think moderating heroin intake is going to be a viable option for people with a heroin problem.<p>There is certainly a large group of people in the world who can benefit from the treatment described here, but I think the article oversteps a great deal by saying this is a more effective addiction treatment than AA.",1404914315

Just a few points of response:<p>1a) Core selections were not arbitrary - they covered most compute instance sizes offered by each service: 2, 4, 8 and 16 cores<p>1b) Testing was not skewed by faster cores. CPU performance analysis was based on SPEC CPU 2006 using base rate runtime. SPEC CPU is a multi-core benchmark with metrics that scale linearly on number of CPU cores.<p>1c) The value analysis (based on CPU performance and price) highlights differences in pricing between services. I believe matching CPU cores and deriving value is preferable to comparing compute instances based on price.<p>2) The intent of the post was to provide and compare multiple relevant performance characteristics for these types of workloads: CPU, memory, (non-cached) storage IO, network. Each of these characteristics is analyzed separately using relevant benchmarks and runtime settings. If your workload relies more heavily on cached IO, then more emphasis could be placed on the memory performance analysis.<p>3) There are hundreds of cloud services. High level analysis like that provided in this post can at least get users pointed in the right direction.<p>4) Web server network performance analysis is based on &quot;eyeball&quot; or last mile testing from our cloud speedtest <a href=""http://cloudharmony.com/speedtest"" rel=""nofollow"">http://cloudharmony.com/speedtest</a>. As stated in the post, this is the most complex performance characteristic to measure. Internal network performance is also included in the DB server analysis.",1404913703

Not hard-coding every widget sizes is somehow... sloppy?  Because the impression I get is that if you can make your app handle different screen sizes appropriately <i>without</i> having to meticulously hand code for every resolution, you&#x27;re coming out way ahead of the game.  That way you present a nice, consistent UX across all devices, and don&#x27;t have to scramble every time a new resolution or device size comes out.<p>It&#x27;s also possible to do this with custom interfaces - a little extra attention to your layout engine will net huge benefits in terms of time saved in designing layouts for each of the possible resolutions.<p>Hardware variations, vendor customizations, capabilities variance - these are real issues.

What you&#x27;ve created is less secure than what we have now.<p>If computer A wants to connect securely to computer B, and it doesn&#x27;t want its connection to be MITM&#x27;d, computer A trusts a 3rd party (computer C) to tell it that computer B is really computer B and not a fake. If you take over the DNS system (which is your version of computer C in my example) you get to write anything to computer A and it will believe it.<p>The whole idea behind a MITM is that an attacker controls communication between A and B, and ideally also controls communication between A and C. Just controlling the network isn&#x27;t enough to subvert the connection, though, because an attacker would need to control one of A, B, or C.<p>If you are the NSA, and you write up a very nice National Security Letter and go to computer C and say &quot;make a fake DNS record for me, because terrorism,&quot; you now get to write blank checks for yourself and computers A and B have effectively no idea that their connection is now subject to MITM.<p>Specifically to exploit your system all you&#x27;d need to do is create a fake A record pointing to computer D, and a fake public key record which matches the PGP key and SSL cert of computer D. If you weren&#x27;t using DNSSEC you could do this on a regular open wireless network with no extra hacking needed. If you are using DNSSEC (and a mandatory validating stub resolver, which Windows doesn&#x27;t ship with) you&#x27;d need to take over the root DNS servers or the registrar which feeds records to the .com. root DNS servers. But the NSA can do all that. Probably others too.<p>So, again, it&#x27;s the exact same state we&#x27;re in with the CAs, with the exception that DNS would be <i>less secure</i> because the client (computer A) doesn&#x27;t have any public keys/ca certs stored on it to verify the DNS servers or domains against.",1404912807

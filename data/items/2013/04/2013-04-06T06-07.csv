In practice, they are not.""  That is why most teams (and languages and standards) end up on spaces, spaces work.  Tabs become unmitigated clusterfucks unless maintained with the pristine care of a monastery monk.<p>More (specific) reasons:<p>#1. Your language, editor, team (with the exception of Go and makefiles) probably specifies not to use tabs.<p>#2. Once tabs and spaces get intermixed, it is a nightmare and the cleanup only works one way easily (goodbye tabs).<p>#3. Tabs have an undefined behavior across editors (for better or worse), indent this line, insert X spaces, move to next marked column, other even more creative ones.<p>#4. Most version control by default does care about whitespace (and should for stuff like Python) -- hence a mixture or auto-conversion situation is nightmarish.<p>#5. Your code will be displayed in places where the user does not have tab control (web interface, console printout, cat, etc) and then all the ""flexibility"" goes away.<p>#6. When your work policy has line length limits, how do you handle it?  If you are allowed 79 ""chars"" per line, can 50  of them be \t chars?  How do you handle the 79 char limit if you code with 1 space tabs, and I code with 10 space tabs?<p>...<p>#42. Tabs are evil.<p>EDIT: Seriously, can anyone link me to a major language style guide / standard outside of GoLang and Makefiles that specifies the use of hard tabs?",1365230124

Whenever I go into a new shop, one of the first things I say is ""I don't care <i>what</i> your formatting rules are so long as they're automated"". Let the dev write the code as they will, so long as the formatting is automated. Automate, automate, automate. I <i>never</i> want to worry about where my curly braces go, tabs versus spaces, 80 columns, and so on. At my current position, we have a git hook which reformats your code according to standards and the ""central"" repo will also reformat, in case you disable it locally. All code winds up with a consistent format that no one agrees on, but we never argue about.<p>No, not everyone will agree on the end result, but it's like worrying about gays in the locker room: grow the f<i></i>* up.

5502797,comment,5498198,5499094,1,0,tracker1,,,"Just a couple months ago, I pushed out a major update to classiccars.com (it's still pretty messy) that cleaned up/reduced the url structure.. the old system had like 50 routing rules to support a wide variety of ""friendly"" urls for searches, and listing display... I reduced that to /listings/find/YEAR(s)/MAKE/MODEL?opts where all search params other than year/make/model were not part of the route, but querystring params... it didn't make sense to support all those routes (not to mention the old results paged via postback).  (hint, you can set the page size up to 100 via a ps=100 querystring param, there's a few others not in the UI yet)... the UI is very similar to how it already was.<p>The new routes make more sense, and are imho more friendly.  The same for listings/view/###/STUB though I put the number/id before the stub, it looks a lot better than it did.  Also, I put permanent redirects for any old references to the canonical url.  It took a bit of work, now some more updates are going in to make the title/description/h1's more friendly.  It's more maintainable now, and some very old URLs are still supported.<p>Currently working on some other modernization bits, which means a lot of the cruft can finally get cleaned out (if a section at a time, slowly).. having a friendly/consistent url stucture is important imho.",1365228460

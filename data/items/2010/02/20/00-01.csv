A while ago Flash replaced Java for embedded interactive media content on the web. Java did not disappear because Java could be used to do other things. Would GE Medical Systems write their diagnostic imaging software in Flash? I think we all know that would not happen. But GE would be fine using Java, and so would the FDA who audits their software before it can go to market.<p>My point is, Flash is going to go away. Maybe not tomorrow, maybe not next month, but eventually it will go away. And it will go away because its creators did not innovate and keep evolving it so that it would be useful in a changed environment. This is the tech industry, the environment always changes. Even worse for those who want to keep doing what they were good at yesterday, it changes in unexpected ways.<p>Let every entrepreneur on this board take what is happening to Flash right now as a cautionary tale. Let's not rail against it, we should learn from it. This is how we evolve the American technology industry, by taking these lessons to heart.",1266626676

1138361,comment,1138015,1138015,0,0,gboudreau,,,"> How can this happen?<p>Good question. I don't think Google published a list of the multiple sources they use to find new websites.\nI think it's not too far fetched to say that all URLs they can see though any of their service would be added to the Googlebot queue.\nSending an email to a Gmail user with a link to admin amahi org might be a trigger...\nBut nothing is sure.<p>> Does PageRank and their famous incoming link equations not matter?? How can this be so off?<p>It's not off really. To Google's eyes, www amahi org == admin amahi org. They became interchangeable. Here's more details on this...<p>Since the end of 2007, subdomains of a specific domain are all linked together somehow.\nRef: Matt Cutts [<a href=""http://www.mattcutts.com/blog/about-me/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.mattcutts.com/blog/about-me/</a>] in a blog post here [<a href=""http://www.mattcutts.com/blog/subdomains-and-subdirectories/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.mattcutts.com/blog/subdomains-and-subdirectories/</a>]<p>What this means is that Google knows that www amahi org and admin amahi org are related.\nIn your case, they were more than just related; they were pratically identical (in content).\nWhen Google finds duplicate content on your site, it might decide to use one version or the other in search results. In Google's eyes, both URL are interchangeable, and so they will be used interchangeably.\nAnd this is particularly apparent in your case, where searching for ""linux home server"" on Google will sometimes show admin amahi org, sometimes www amahi org, as the first result.\nOr when searching for ""link:admin amahi org"" will return pages that link to www amahi org.<p>Ref: Duplicate content [<a href=""http://www.google.com/support/webmasters/bin/answer.py?hl=en&answer=66359"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.google.com/support/webmasters/bin/answer.py?hl=en...</a>]<p>> How long will this last?<p>Nobody can say. They never give any estimate on how long re-crawling a site will take.<p>> We have gone to WMT to dramatically accelerate the crawl rate of www amahi org<p>You should do the same with admin amahi org, after you've changed a couple of things (more about that below).<p>> More importantly, how can we prevent this from happening again?<p>Multiple ways: robots.txt, Canonicalization, Sitemaps...<p>robots.txt: it's pretty easy to make robots.txt dynamic:\n.htaccess:\n<Files robots.txt>\n    ForceType application/x-httpd-php\n</Files><p>robots.txt:\n<?php if ($_SERVER['SERVER_NAME'] == 'admin amahi org') { echo ""Disallow: /""; } ?><p>Canonicalization: See details here [<a href=""http://www.google.com/support/webmasters/bin/answer.py?answer=139066"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.google.com/support/webmasters/bin/answer.py?answe...</a>]\nBasically, you should add a <link rel=""canonical"" href=""<a href=""http://www"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www</a> amahi org/...> in the <head> section of your pages.\nThis will indicate to Googlebot your preferred URL.\nAgain, it's pretty easy with any scripting language... Just hardcode the ""<a href=""http://www"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www</a> amahi org part of the @href, and put the rest dynamically.<p>Sitemaps: You should submit sitemaps for both admin amahi org and www amahi org on Google Webmaster Tools.\nIn fact, you should create only one sitemap, containing only www amahi org URLs you want Google to see, and use that same sitemap for both www and admin sites.\nSubmitting this sitemap through Google Webmaster Tools could help Googlebot pick up your 301 Redirect, and your new robots.txt, a little faster.<p>Good luck with this!",1266626493

The first year of my fashion studies was (more or less) devoted to the meaning of the word 'fashion', but I still manage to understand what people mean by using it.<p>What I meant was statement in the sense of fashion[1], which is the connotation of your clothes, 'reavealing information' as you put it. But if you are deliberately  buying geeky t-shirt or 'easy' clothes, you are still making a conscious statement, for example ""I'm a geek"" and ""I prefer comfort over fit"". In the event that the selection of your clothes is not deliberate, there's still the connotation of them. For example, with 'easy' clothes some may look at you as a slob, while others sees you as laid back.<p>While you can be outside of the 'fashion system', your clothes still have meaning, to you and to others. If you want to read a proper simile regarding fashion, i.e. not with http headers, I can (almost) recommend the works of Roland Barthes [2].<p>[1] <a href=""http://encarta.msn.com/dictionary_561533193/fashion_statement.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://encarta.msn.com/dictionary_561533193/fashion_statemen...</a>\n[2] <a href=""http://books.google.com/books?q=roland+barthes+fashion"" rel=""nofollow"">http://books.google.com/books?q=roland+barthes+fashion</a>",1266626208

While I commend you for trying to provide a cross-browser portable event model, the fact is that the changes in 1.4 got it wrong. If that had only affected jQuery itself, it wouldn't have been so bad, we could simply not have used the affected features until they were working properly. But it didn't just affect jQuery, it broke handling of change events for controls like checkboxes fundamentally in IE, so that well-established workarounds like the old ""onclick='blur()'"" trick were no longer effective either.<p>That particular bug took us several hours to pin down after we moved to 1.4, and ultimately our only solution was to back out the change and go back to the 1.3 series until the fix.<p>There was a similar situation in the upgrade from 1.3.1 to 1.3.2: what sounds like a minor bug-fix type release actually changed the way visibility was tested significantly, which caused problems for an occasional colleague of mine who was working with nested potentially-hidden views (i.e., one of a set of outer containers would be visible, and within that there were things like tab/accordion structures where some of the information would also be hidden). Again, while I don't doubt that the change was made with good intent and obviously the performance of the newer approach is much better, it pulled the rug out from under an existing project, and forced the people maintaining it to stop and go back over previously working code so that it would continue working with the new jQuery.<p>As I said, I've been using jQuery for a while and generally I've liked it. It's useful and I'm grateful to the developers who share it with the rest of us. But the original poster was asking about putting in the effort to migrate an existing project that already uses another library to use jQuery, in part because of issues of modularity and compatibility. I can't recommend that without reservation if even point releases might introduce the kinds of backward-incompatible change I've mentioned here.",1266626109

Or, build a demo you can distribute to people elsewhere without having to distribute the backend as well, because the GUI phones home to get its algorithmic work done on our servers.<p>It's worked pretty decently, but we keep it internal because we just don't have the compute resources to offer things like SAT-solving or logic programming or planning as a service to the general public.",1266625113

Happily, in this case there is no cause for concern.<p>(1) The book uses test-driven development for the most part; the snippet you pasted is just enough to get the ""failed signup"" test to pass, and is not the full implementation. (2) The code you copied doesn't even save the user, so there's no potential security breach at this point. (3) There's no admin attribute yet. (It's coming in Chapter 9.) (4) The User model is protected by attr_accessible in any case, as discussed in Chapter 5 (<a href=""http://www.railstutorial.org/chapters/modeling-and-viewing-users-one#sec:accessible_attributes"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.railstutorial.org/chapters/modeling-and-viewing-u...</a>). There's no way to tell from inspecting a controller action whether or not there's a security breach at the model level.<p>N.B. Just yesterday I exchanged notes with Yehuda Katz on this very subject; he and Carl Lerche both agree that Rails should close the attr_accessible security hole by default, much as Rails 3 now escapes the output of Embedded Ruby by default. My hope is that we'll see this implemented in Rails 3.x, for some value of x.",1266624940

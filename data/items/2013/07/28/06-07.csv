You&#x27;ve known for one or two years that this day would come and that the required notification was 90 days.  You decided to stay with the company for well over 90 days, so with a little bit of advance planning you could have met their draconian requirements.  Now because of a technicality - you neglected to fax them and they forgot to collect your signature - you might be legally able to get out of it.<p>Yes, you&#x27;d save $92, but in terms of your own life, getting out of it is worse for you than it is for them.  If you go around the world not trusting and manipulating people, you experience the world as an untrustworthy and manipulative place.  You will never be close friends with somebody that you cannot manipulate, and you&#x27;ll never be close friends with somebody that you can really truly trust.  These things might not matter to you until you&#x27;re in a really bad situation, but by then it will be too late.<p>Look, I&#x27;ve done lots of things like this.  I&#x27;ve put people into jams that they simply couldn&#x27;t get out of with no visible harm done to me in the eyes of anybody else.  Being manipulative gives you power and control and money, but not being manipulative gives you personal integrity.  At this point in my life I would easily pay $92 for my personal integrity.<p>The right thing to do in this situation if you really felt like 90 days was walking all over you would be to take back the contract the very next day and either agree on 30 days or get your money back, possibly with a chargeback from your credit card.  The second best right thing would be to give them 90 days notice.  The third best right thing would be to go and talk to them right away.  When I say &quot;right thing&quot; I mean &quot;thing that is not somehow taking advantage of the situation&quot;.

Intelligence isn&#x27;t the only one.<p>If you behave in a way where others don&#x27;t want to see you with total power they will have great incentive to find ways to have you lose power.  The risks to the USA from being seen as thinking that might makes right is an acceptable philosophy (and since the USA has the might to pretty much do whatever it wants right now it can get away with doing so).<p>But those that must accept the bully today, will want to find a way out eventually.  Currently the USA seems to mainly be aligning with short sited politicians the world over that trade off the rights of their citizens to domination by whatever they USA wants done.  This actually works for the short term (to a degree).<p>But it likely creates situations where citizens elsewhere get tired of electing toadies to USA dictates and throw them out.  And given the dynamics, those politicians pursuing anti-USA policies from those countries is increased as the flagrant might-make-right actions turn people off.<p>Balancing intelligence with diplomacy is wise.  But the USA seems to have totally abandoned the idea that the rest of the world&#x27;s population (95% of the total) matter.  Diplomacy seems to have been abandoned for the much easier and funner (when you are the mightiest) policy of we have the might, do what we say or you will suffer.<p>I agree, that the world can become a huge mess fast.  I believe diplomacy is critical in such a system - in order to protect yourself from the result of an out of control mess.  But diplomacy is a mess and complicated and frustrating.  I can see why you don&#x27;t want to deal with it if you have the might to tell everyone to bow to your dictates.  But I think it is foolish and risky to have limited diplomacy as much as the USA has.  This limiting of diplomacy in the USA is not new, the consequences have just become much greater it seems to me in the last 20 years.  We only seem to have really had any patience for it at all when dealing with the USSR - because we were worried about the damage that could be done if things went badly.",1374992616

I&#x27;d go for a Nokia device if you do get one - they are superior simply due to the navigation provided and their build quality.<p>That problem with outlook.com is not related to the phone itself nor the mobile platform so that is moot.

His 2012 anti-drone bill would have made it so improper use of a drone would exclude the evidence collected by drone, and authorized civil suits against operators of said drones. Sounds good...except it was extremely broad.<p>Here is an example of drone use that would be covered. An endangered species of bird has nested on a university campus. A bird researcher at the university is using a small drone with camera to periodically observe the nest. His research is partly funded by an NSF grant.<p>While flying the drone to the nest one evening, the researcher sees a man attempting to rape a woman in a public area of the university, and alerts the police.<p>This would have been forbidden drone use under Paul&#x27;s bill unless the researcher had a warrant. The researcher would have been covered because he was partly funded by the Federal government, and that was sufficient to put one under the bill. The evidence stemming from the drone use would be inadmissible and the researcher could be sued by the attempted rapist.<p>There was an exigent circumstances provision in the bill that provided an exception when swift action was necessary to prevent danger to life. That would at first SEEM to apply to an attempted rape in progress. Alas, the exigent circumstances only applied to drones operated by a &quot;law enforcement party&quot;, which the bill defined as authorized by law or funded by the Federal government to investigate or prosecute offenses against the United States. A university bird researcher is not a &quot;law enforcement party&quot;, and so the exigent circumstances exception does not apply. (Heck, even state and local police would not be law enforcement parties, because they investigate offenses at the state and local level, not offenses against the United States).<p>Fortunately this bill died quickly. There is a 2013 version. The House version takes out the part about it covering anyone who is funded in whole or part by the Federal government, so would remove my hypothetical biologist from coverage. It would only apply to drones operated by entities acting under the authority of the Federal government.<p>The Senate version still covers anyone who is funded in whole or part by the Federal government.<p>Here&#x27;s the 2013 House version: <a href=""http://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/113/hr972"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/113/hr972</a><p>Here&#x27;s the 2013 Senate version: <a href=""http://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/113/s1016"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/113/s1016</a>",1374991202

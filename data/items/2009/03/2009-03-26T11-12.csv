533315,comment,532374,532750,0,0,Tichy,,,"Lomborg's claims rest on the assumption that the benefits are small and uncertain. I remember him citing ""heat deaths"" as one of the worst predicted outcomes of global warming. ""Warmists"" would certainly disagree that this is the worst thing to expect. I don't know the proper name for this argumentation technique, in my opinion Lomborg creates a kind of strawman, but that is not quite the right word. He says ""look here, heat deaths are a non-issue, so global warming is a non-issue"", when really heat-deaths are not the main issue of global warming.<p>You are of course right about rational decision making, but the estimates of the risks diverge between the groups, so they arrive at different decisions.",1238068602

Locking access to a variable will work the same way, even if it's multiple processes trying to access it vs multiple threads. Is the difference just in the mechanism of the lock, or is there some type of difference in behaviour in accessing shared items between threads and processes?",1238068353

533309,comment,532665,533108,0,0,lanceweatherby,,,"Here is a real example.  Pretend like you are in a finance class.  It's a case study.  On Microsoft buying Yahoo!  Determine how much Microsoft should be willing to pay for Yahoo! and the assumptions and rationale behind your conclusion.  Or how much is AOL worth as a spinout of Time Warner.  The core of the answer lies in something called the Capital Asset Pricing Model and it is as every bit as complex as the fixed point combinator for which YC was named.<p>A little more practical and more marketing aligned, doing  real market research for a natural foods store to determine if they should expand their footprint to other locations or just increase the size of their current store.  It took over a month to design the questionnaire before the prof deemed it acceptable.<p>With that said, the real challenge, and what any top school does, is teach students how to prioritize.  They give you so much work that you can not possibly get it all complete at the level of excellence in which you want to operate so you have to learn when something is good enough and move on to the next pressing issue.  Which, BTW, is pretty much what you need to do in a startup as well.",1238068091
533308,comment,532374,532938,0,0,Tichy,,,"I think your example is useless. Of course predicting any kind of calamity would warrant spending money to reduce the damage (in the larger context, ie considering where spending the money will have the most effect). If a meteor would be about to land on your hometown, would you scramble to get to the other side of the planet? Of course you would, no matter if the meteor falls down because of natural causes or because of a giant magnet somebody build to attract it.",1238067892

533290,comment,532665,533108,0,0,carbon8,,,"Well, first of all, what's hard for one person can be easy for the next. Plus, people have a lot of misconceptions about many business related fields.<p>Take marketing, for example. It is often misinterpreted as purely ""promotion"" when really it also encompasses product development, pricing and placement. For me, product development and placement come naturally while I find branding to be tremendously difficult, certainly more difficult than any technical challenge I've ever faced. What one person finds ""easy"" or ""hard"" is dependent on a lot of factors, including personality type, skills, what sector that person is operating in, etc. For one product or service, pricing may be extremely simple while in another it might require significant market analysis.<p>Also, whether a person finds something ""hard"" or not doesn't directly relate to its value. I wouldn't find it ""hard"" to spend hours reading case studies, but they are tremendously valuable since you can learn from other companies' successes and failures and apply them to your own company. On the other hand, someone might find advanced corporate finance ""hard,"" but unless he or she wants to work in a job in which it would apply, it's largely useless for that person.<p>FWIW, I'm not in an MBA program, but I do the web business thing while my wife is in a top-tier MBA program and is an exec in the financial industry. She has an analytical background but prefers strategy and operations. I know one of the things she finds both challenging and valuable is being exposed to fields that are outside of her interests but are important for having a well-rounded view of how businesses and marketplaces function. In bad business conditions this is especially valuable since you can't just stumble and guess your way around like you can when money flows easily.",1238066356

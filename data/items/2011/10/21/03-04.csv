However, there seems to be evidence [1] that the typical 2 month summer break is hurting student performance - especially for poorer students whose parents can't afford to put them into enrichment activities in the summer. How, exactly, would 11 month school years be a nightmare? Misalignment already exists - Colleges get 4 months off, don't they?<p>I also recall seeing a talk about this exact topic, but I can't seem to find it at the moment.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.theglobeandmail.com/life/parenting/education/learning/students-in-year-round-schools-do-better-study-shows/article1663859/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.theglobeandmail.com/life/parenting/education/lear...</a>",1319169528

Io was actually my first dynamic language, not Python or Ruby or Javascript.  I stopped using Io for a few years when I moved on to other things, but _why's article ""Io Has a Very Clean Mirror"" brought it back to mind.<p>I seriously considered Lua but I felt object orientation needs to be incorporated very fundamentally in a language.  I had previous experience with mIRC which shares Lua's idea of ""everything is a table"", and while mIRC is no doubt productive I felt tables would be a step backwards compared to Io's objects.<p>At the time I started, the C/C++ binding frameworks for Lua were not as mature as they are now, not as numerous, or I simply wasn't aware of them.<p>From a language aesthetic standpoint my decision came down to Io, or Ruby, but I looked at the C Ruby source code and it didn't seem very suited to embedding.  For instance the official implementation of Ruby had some dependence on global/static variables which precluded the idea of running multiple instances of the VM in a process.  Io allows this, although I haven't used it yet; I plan to use it to support threading, one VM per thread.  And basically the Ruby interpreter codebase wants to own main() and call my code as a library; I wanted to own main() and call the interpreter as a library.  Io supports this, and it's codebase is smaller.",1319169389

People <i>wanted</i> multitouch devices.   Google didn't need to look to Apple to know that, you could derive it independently by doing a simple consumer survey of what smartphone consumers wanted.<p>Google added what people wanted and brought an OS to the market that had that and a whole lot of innovative features that the iPhone didn't.

Danger Inc. was a company founded by Andy Rubin who then went on to found Android Inc. which was bought by Google and Andy Rubin now runs the Android show.<p>So one of the features that, according to your misinformed opinion, originated in iPhone, was actually done before by a company started by a guy who runs Android.<p>Then again, I doubt Danger Inc. was the first to come up with the idea of integrated application store. It's really a logical evolution of PalmGear, which operated since 1997 and was the biggest application store for Palm OS devices. It was a website but it's not such a great leap to integrate that directly into OS. It couldn't be done in 1997 because PDAs didn't have internet connection but finally the wireless technology caught up and Apple was the second company to do the obvious.<p>The same goes for multi touch. It has been done in other contexts before - Apple didn't invent the idea. The single touch UI was done years before on Palm devices. I'm not sure if Apple was the first to do multi-touch specifically on a phone but it was, again, an inevitable evolution of existing ideas. It just happened that Apple was designing the first gen of their product from scratch at the time when multi-touch screen technology was mature enough for mass market so they could bake it really well.<p>Mobile Safari? How is a web browser on a phone Apple's invention? Palm OS had decent browser a decade earlier. Safari is better but only because the hardware available to iPhones is orders of magnitude better than the hardware on those Palm devices.<p>But the real problem with such arguments is that you completely discount the tens of thousands of ideas that Apple had to ""copy"" (using your terminology) from earlier phones. Sure, they've added a few things of their own, but so did everyone else. The nature of technology business is that you take the best of what exists today, you add a few unique pieces and release an improvement version. It's myopic to complain that Google copied some ideas but completely ignore the Apple's massive copying of ideas that is iCloud (just to give one example).",1319167716

Sheep don't do this.<p>Cornell did a lot of the research on what sapplings the goats would and would not eat, but it's been five years since the last time I visited Arnot forest, where this research was being done.

How does this sit with ""they're not stupid, and they know the situation far better than you""?<p>And now you claim that the industry is doing what you advised/predicted. So it seems that intelligent people can analyse situations where they are not in possession of as many facts as other intelligent people, and still come out with a more correct answer. (Or at least, an answer that appears more correct given the industry's actions at the time. Possibly it already had the correct answer, and was just moving slowly.)<p>Maybe these intelligent people will be wrong more often than not, but looking at incentives: if you're right, you look like a prophet or at least get to feel self-satisfied. If you're wrong, everyone forgets; you lose nothing except the time spent thinking and writing, which was probably fun and educational anyway.

One wrong keystroke (step over instead step into) and you throw all your work away.  It is much easer to write a test script that exercises the bug, and then run that until the bug is fixed.  (print is a great way to get information out of your program while debugging.)  The added benefit is that this can become a regression test after you fix the bug, so the bug never comes back.  I doubt a debugger can do that.<p>I will admit that sometimes I play with things in the REPL for a while instead of writing a script.  This is somewhat like the debugger, but at a higher level (functions instead of lines), and more interactive.  You can fix your faulty function, then hit M-p and try invoking it again until it works.",1241201058

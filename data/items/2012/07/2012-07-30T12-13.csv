Food is just the product that gets us through the door to see the other stuff: meat, veg, bread and milk are the things that the rest of the occupants of large shopping centres tend to lack.<p>> <i>not [in the business] of making highly-secure websites.</i><p>On the contrary: they are taking in and storing personal details and in some cases banking details (they sell banking services as well as physical products), and getting access to your account may give someone the ability to buy things on your credit card. It is my understanding that both <i>by law</i> and by the agreements they have in place with their chose credit card processing partners they are required to live up to certain security expectations, and if they do not live up to those expectations they should be investigated, fined, and stopped from trading in those ways until they are up to scratch.<p>The claim that their password storage is ""up to industry standards"" is both unduly vague (though as the conversation was by tweet the length limitation there may be partly to blame for that) and simply wrong. They are not compliant with PCIDSS (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Payment_Card_Industry_Data_Security_Standard"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Payment_Card_Industry_Data_Secu...</a>) which I believe is considered the industry standard for handling credit card data or accounts that are associated with it.",1343652976

But push server requires open connection per active client, which might be in the millions at the same time. Pull server does not need active connections to be open all the time. Only when a request happens. For example web servers use pull method to service more clients with less cpu and memory usage because the connections are actually only open when http request/reply happens.

So if starting/running a business is really truly important to you, then run that buisness. It doesn't make sense to start a business, raise money,  hire others if what you really want to do is go to a club and hang out 'till 3 in the morning. It does have to be one or the other, or that business will fail.<p>Now, I'm not saying not to do the social stuff. Friends and relationships are very important. What I believe Larry is saying is to not take your eyes off the prize. You've started the business for a reason. You need to be focused on it and nurture it until it succeeds. If you really don't want to put in the time for that, there are other alternative like getting a regular job. Then you can work 8 hours a day, have friends, and party. That's fine.<p>To be successful as an entrepreneur, you've got to dig down deep and take care of your product. Its a lot of work. A ton of work. If it wasn't, everyone would be doing it. Instead, we have a few people trying to start/run businesses. And it can be Hell. But, if you don't want to deal with that extreme focus, that's fine too.<p>Think of the movie Cool Runnings.

They are only copying facts (address, price, contact info) and the post title (which is likely too short to qualify for copyright).

(Example: <a href=""http://oi50.tinypic.com/5l9cvb.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://oi50.tinypic.com/5l9cvb.jpg</a>) At the bottom of each post it has a ""public domain"" mark and says ""This work ([name] by [poster email]), identified by craigslist, is free of known copyright restrictions."" This is clearly untrue: the photographs are creative and original works copyrighted to the poster (and licensed to Craigslist), as are the prose descriptions whenever they carry more than a bare minimum of information.<p>I can't imagine what 3Taps is thinking. In contrast to the relatively cautious approach of PadMapper, they're being extremely brazen in copying <i>everything</i> from Craigslist and using its name to promote themselves.

Yahoo absolutely should start out appealing to its primary demographic as that will hook the greatest number of new visitors, and you've just described the typical web user.  That web user will feel much more at home on this default page than on Ars Technica's default page.<p>I agree with you that in time, the page should adapt, and preferably rapidly.  The difference is the starting point which should be the same as the starting point in the grocery checkout lane. You also shop at the grocery, but the checkout lane isn't designed for you.",1343649812

But XBox Live is the elephant in the room here.<p>Quietly -- or not so quielty, depending on your perspective -- the XBox has become a behemoth in the entertainment world. Not just with video games, but with all forms of entertainment content (aside from music, which MSFT has never really been able to nail). Take, for instance, the interesting stat that over 60% of all Netflix streaming users stream via a gaming console. Or that close to half of all XBox owners watch one hour or more of TV or movie content per day through their consoles. Though it has formidable competitors in Amazon, Apple, and to some extent Google, Microsoft has a pretty impressive strategic position in the battle for the living room.<p>The only chink in the armor has been mobile. That's why MSFT kept investing so heavily in Windows Phone, and why it's going to fight as hard as possible in the tablet space. Not owning mobile means not owning the total entertainment experience, which means not having a ubiquitous ecosystem. So mobile is pretty darned crucial here.",1343649664

Evasion is very low.<p>""The latest official evasion rate for the United Kingdom is 5.2% of all licensable places (for the 2009/10 financial year). The official evasion rate estimates the percentage (not the number) of all premises (not individuals or households) evading the licence fee in the UK. It is calculated for the Department for Culture, Media and Sport using a model that compares the number of licences in force to external statistics on the number of households and other licensable places in the UK.""<p>This is based on data that suggests ""Under 3% of UK households dont have a television set (this figure does not include other premises like businesses)."" Approximately 25 million TV licenses are in force.<p>Possibly there is more evasion in things like holiday homes and caravans, which should be licensed. But generally data suggests, as does my anecotal evidence, that most UK home-owners just see the TV license as a standard bill that is paid annually.<p><a href=""http://www.tvlicensing.co.uk/about/foi-licences-facts-and-figures-AB18/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.tvlicensing.co.uk/about/foi-licences-facts-and-fi...</a>",1343649625

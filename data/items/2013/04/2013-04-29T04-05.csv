The cost of each write grows exponentially after some time. We've played with parameters, buckets size and numbers, cache, we tried over SSDs vs regular HD, no big improvement.

Typically, the problem seems to be related to the size of the file on disk and the number of buckets.

India has been a recipient of migrants from Central Asia, North Asia and Europe over the last two thousand years. India to it's smallest unit is a hive of ghettos, each ghetto not caring about the other one, while striving in the futile exercise of ensuring it's own survival. People don't care about cleanliness or have general civic sense because they don't see themselves as one community. The lack of the sense of ""India"" is appalling. We have Kashmiris, Biharis, Marathis, Gujaratis. Oriyas, Nagas, Tamils, Other South Indians, Bhaiyyas(from Uttar Pradesh), Punjabis and a thousand of other sub-cultures.

""The Hindus believe that there is no country but theirs, no nation like theirs, no kings like theirs, no religion like theirs, no science like theirs.They are haughty, foolishly vain, self-conceited, and stolid. They are by nature niggardly in communicating that which they know, and they take the greatest possible care to withhold it from men of another caste among their own people, still much more, of course, from any foreigner ... Their haughtiness is such that, if you tell them of any science or scholar in Khorasan and Persis, they will think you to be both an ignoramus and a liar. If they traveled and mixed with other nations, they would soon change their mind, for their ancestors were not as narrow-minded as the present generation is.""

For a phone, this means an accessible bootloader is a minimum requirement for me to make a purchase, at least at the computer-equivalent ($100+) price-range.

The people there aren't dumb--they know all of these actions have harmful and negative effects on others' help and the general environment, but they would rather not care than care for the most part. Herein lies the fundamental problem...if you would rather not care, well there's no solution to that. I am originally from Northern India but on my most recent visit, we went to Mumbai.

And if the student had a new innovative answer, they would simply mark it wrong because it didn't their 'one true' answer, even if the solution was more elegant and better than the common pattern. Therefore the only way of scoring high marks was to practice all the common patterns.<p>Rote learning works at all levels.<p>I remember some days back I watched a interview of RMS on youtube, and he was asked a question on how you could be a good programmer and what books you had to read. And he gave a straight reply- You had to simply work on some hard real world problems/projects and bring them to closure. That was his advice.<p>Too bad these days we check people on everything apart from their actual work.",1367208363

5624005,comment,5623663,5623903,1,0,chacham15,,,"As stated this seems really easy. I think it is supposed to be more like Meebo where the users can resize/move every window (i.e. they dont have to be aligned to any boundary) and they recieve a new message. The Meebo software wants to place a new 100x200 window not on top of any existing window. Write the algorithm to determine where to place it. Then generalize the algorithm to WxH. Hard enough? (If not, find an algorithm that does this in linear time)",1367208351

Most people are only going to look at just /, so let's say 3000 pageviews. The day after was still seeing good amounts of traffic, so it wasn't some kind of momentary ""all 3000 hit the site in the same minute"" situation: it seems like a fairly benign decay. How could you possibly have been dealing with 287 concurrent users?<p>My website (saurik.com) is seriously written in JavaScript. I was doing this long before node was popular, and so it is designed ""horribly sub-optimally"": it is using Rhino, which is not known for speed. I use XSL/T as a templating engine to build the page layouts, which is also not known for speed. Every request is synchronously logged to a database. I get over 50k HTML pageviews a day, most for one recent article which I posted a few weeks ago: when I posted it, I was getting well over 3k pageviews per hour.<p>I do not do any caching: I generate each page dynamically every time it is accessed. I seriously dynamically generate the CSS every request (there are some variables). Even with 3k HTML pageviews per hour, that's less than one complex request per second. How does one even build a website that can't handle that load? That is what I'd seriously be interested in seeing: not ""how do I handle being #1 on Hacker News"", but ""why is it that so many websites are unable to handle two requests per minute"".",1367208350

I was heavily involved with the Bay Area Developer GRoupE :-) We had BADGE meetings initially at Stanford Linear Accelerator and then later at Stanford. We used to head to the Oasis for the after the meeting meeting. As a lot of the original Amiga developers (pre-Commodore) were based out of Los Gatos (the original home of Amiga when Commodore bought them) many would come to those meetings and share various insights with us.<p>At one point we decided to host a demo contest (which Tom Rokicki pronounced with a long 'e' sound) it was the hottest ticket in the Bay Area for a while, we even had Commodore and Newtek offering up gear for prizes.

That's 80% of the solution, right there. Install equivalent whole-page caching for any other framework or system and tell your HTTP server how to pick it up; that should leave you prepared for hundreds of RPS.<p>We're at the stage where people are posting the equivalent of ""how I survived skipping lunch"".

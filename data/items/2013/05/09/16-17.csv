Or, we can steal from every citizen in the whole country and use the resulting money to pay the doctor.  This second option would be called ""single payer,"" and it is my preferred policy, but it does not seem to be obviously morally different from enslaving doctors or obviously morally preferable to requiring people to pay for the services they use.",1368118799

The Chrystler bailout in 1980 and the more recent GM bailout preserved the existing Detroit power structure. All of that talented labor pool and capital that would have been set free via liquidation instead was allowed to stay together. These companies didn't innovate because they didn't have to.",1368118796

It really depends how you're finding jobs, where you're working and how many companies you've worked for, your personality, etc.<p>You're from a different generation from me and you have much more experience, so hopefully you're right.  On the other hand, I think it's possible that things have changed and the people out there who'll attempt to exploit youth could be more common.<p>Personally I've been offered jobs by people I know who'll treat me right, that's an option I didn't have when I was 20, but it's a different story now I'm _almost_ 30.

If you have a huge sample size you're quite frequently going to find statistically significant differences between groups, but often those differences aren't that meaningful.<p>If you assessed differences in average human height between two cities based on a million datapoints, you're pretty darn likely to find a difference that's statistically significant but not really important or meaningful (like a .1mm difference in average height).<p>The above is why the American Psychological Association says ""reporting and interpreting effect sizes in the context of [p-values] is essential to good research"".[1] It's also why Statwing always report effect sizes along with p-values for hypothesis tests.[2]<p>(For clarity: effect size is best presented in readily interpretable, concrete terms like height or whatever unit you're using. If that's not possible because you're comparing ratings on a 1 to 7 scale or something, or if you want to compare effect sizes across different types of analyses, there are specific metrics of effect size).<p>[1] <a href=""http://people.cehd.tamu.edu/~bthompson/apaeffec.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://people.cehd.tamu.edu/~bthompson/apaeffec.htm</a><p>[2] <a href=""https://www.statwing.com/demo"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.statwing.com/demo</a>",1368118755

Here are my perceptions, as I was SUPER curious about the car before I drove it:<p>Pros:\n1) The drive is AMAZING. The car is quiet, it accelerates amazingly, and the regenerative braking is really cool.\n2) It feels like the future. The huge computer screen is cool (but distracting, you can go on the internet at anytime). \n3) The ability to get software updates all the time is cool when thinking about cars.<p>Cons:\n1) It is impractical for an urban dweller in a condo building: you have to pay for an electrician to come install a special outlet, then pay for the electricity (which is fine if you own a house, getting this through a condo association is a nightmare).\n2) The whole time you are thinking about the battery charge. What if you forget to plug in your car at night?\n3) For the cost, it lacks feature a luxury car should have: park assist is one feature. The model i drove was around 90k and the more ""luxury"" features felt like a standard sedan (the leather, the wood, etc). You are definitely paying for the tech.\n4) What if someone hits you? How much compared to other cars does it cost to get repaired? The salesperson couldn't answer this.\n5) The car is connected to 3G for maps (unless you upgrade) and at some point, you will be paying for this service.\n6) You have to plan out where you power up for a trip longer than 200 miles...so annoying.<p>If you have the capacity or need for a fun, toy car at this price point...check out the Model S. I don't find it practical as a main car in the city.",1368118588

There should be well-funded software czars and statistics czars at each university that facilitate the efforts of the individual researchers to try to reduce the amount of shoddy science that gets published. Researchers are really terrible at this, and presumably slower than dedicated people even who are working on many different projects, so the division of labor should make the whole apparatus vastly more efficient, able to write and win more grants, etc. Of course, many researchers would fight against this because if you can't publish shoddy research, you can't publish as much research, but I would think there should be some way to get there from here.",1368118532

They usually need help with pulling in the latest sources, putting together a few scripts, and then creating the packages to put in the repos. It would be great to support your favorite distro this way.<p>-Also, because you're located in Argentina, I'll assume you speak Spanish, in which case you can help with localization-translating software into Spanish. I imagine because it's a common language, a lot is already done, but I'm sure there's at least one or two applications that you regularly use which aren't, or maybe the man pages aren't done.<p>-Alpha and beta testing, and filing bugs is an important thing that needs to get done. If you just set up VMs with the latest alpha images of a distro when they come out, you could probably help the release team find bugs.<p>-Read and reply to the mailing lists for projects that you use. Many questions that pop up are pretty easy to solve. Also, hang out on the IRC channel for that project and help newbies. If the project has a wiki, help fill out more pages. Tutorials are very useful.<p>Most FOSS is already focused around remote collaboration, so I don't think you're at any disadvantage there.  I think the hardest part is picking which project to support. I would recommend thinking about which programs/distros you use the most, and if they are small, or new, they will likely need help. From there, you can email and ask what to do, or just start trying to help.<p>Good luck!",1368118328

One such promise is under what circumstances opcode 32 causes a transaction to be marked as invalid.  (Don't bother looking it up -- you'll have to go down a rabbit hole for a while.)  It is <i>critically important</i> that all code implementing opcode 32 comes to the same conclusion regarding every transaction in history and every transaction in the future.<p>Consider an edge case for opcode 32, occurring in a transaction that I'll call T, two years ago.  T is, as of right now, accepted as valid in the history that bitcoin (as you understand that term) accepts as correct.  If a malfunctioning bitcoin client were to reject T, they would reject large portions of history after T, because they'd be predicated on an invalid series of transactions.  Following me so far?<p>So the more interesting case isn't when there is a difference of opinions in the past, it is when there is a predictable difference of opinions in the future.  In this case, one set of clients starts building a transaction ledger B, and one starts building a transaction ledger B'.  They are different transaction ledgers.  People subscribing to either ledger, which they think of as The One True Bitcoin Ledger, will be mighty pissed when other people in The One True Bitcoin Economy tell them that their unforgeable, unloseable, ungovernable units of crypocurrency are actually worthless bits.<p>This is called a blockchain fork.  Bitcoiners are terrified of it happening again.  (Yes, it has already happened at least once.  Long story.  ""No harm, no foul, he wasn't trying to crash our entire economy so we dodged a bullet."" is pretty much the consensus among Bitcoiners who actually understand what happened there.)",1368118266

Modern hardware is capable of > 1Gflop/joule, so the raw compute of 3.2Mflop/sec actually takes something on the order of 3.2mw.<p>Of course, the computation is being done in q15 instead of float, which (in theory) should require something on the order of 1/2 the energy.  On the other hand, the processor cant <i>just</i> do FFTs.  Its spending energy going in and out of lower-power states, running other code, etc, etc, and I dont have any data for the energy usage of the M4 specifically, to say nothing of the other components on the board.<p>In principle though, the energy actually consumed by performing the FFTs should be pretty minimal; most of it will be going to everything else unless the hardware and software are both very carefully designed for efficiency.",1368118211

When it comes to privacy and PII, Google holds itself to an extremely high standard. Many of these ""social"" innovations that are popping up on the market place were rejected out-of-hand at Google because it holds itself to an extremely high ethical standard regarding user data, as it actually respects them.<p>I was shocked, for example, when I learned that a certain social network gives universal profile access to employees as a perk. That would not happen at Google. If you looked at your high-school ex-girlfriend's email, you'd be fired immediately (and deserve it).<p>Social <i>is</i> creepy, because it's all about being defined by other people, which is ridiculous and horrible. What, so do I suck at Programming Languages because I haven't trolled my 25 closest acquaintances for endorsements? Am I really going to become more credible in Machine Learning if I get 15 strangers to ""endorse"" me?<p>The major conflict in ""Social"" is what I call ""Document vs. Improve"" (or: Exploit vs. Explore). A social app can expand the web of social connections and make it more efficient, but (a) that's really hard, and (b) there isn't a lot of short-term money in it. Or it can document social relationships that already exist, and make a shit-ton of money off the data. That's easy, but it doesn't actually make anyone's life better. Guess which one the mainstream social players favor?<p>What I find depressing about LinkedIn is how much it has play-by-play replicated the old, broken way of doing things. Resumes.

I still see many themes using things like <i>query_posts()</i> instead of creating a new <i>WP_Query</i> or a hooking into the <i>pre_get_posts</i> filter. As I mentioned below, Wordpress would ideally have its built-in functions trimmed dramatically, though this would really murder backwards compatibility.<p>I don't really think it's Wordpress's fault that the Loop uses the alternative PHP control structure, but I agree that the Loop's Codex page is abominable. You may or may not be aware that the Codex is a wiki, and thus poor quality information can and will be added.<p>I would like to see a loop using the Iterator class. However, there are quite a few complexities to that, as mentioned in this feature request [1].

There's absolutely no freedom of expression. Citizens don't trust each other. There's around 275 intelligence officers for each Syrian citizen. The country is littered with the picture of the ruling Assad mafia that's shoved down the throat of all citizens. The vast majority of Syrians are scared to death of government. I know this, since not only have I lived there, I have many relatives and friends who have been either imprisoned, tortured, or exiled for simply speaking out.<p>Obviously, the government does have some support, but it's vast majority of supporters are beneficiaries of the government or are dependent on the government for their source of income. Add to that the brainwashing and fear the government has instilled in its own citizens for over 40 years, and it's not surprising to see such reports.<p>> Where are videos - have you verified them?<p>Yes, many of those videos have been verified.<p>> So you fully support killing civilians to aid a propaganda effort?<p>What a ridiculous question. You very well know my position about advocating for the rights and freedom of civilians. But, that question demonstrates many of the classic logical fallacies in your entire argument.<p>The Syrian government has been terrorizing its own citizens before your claimed propaganda efforts were in the picture. Sure, there are players that are now taking advantage of the situation, but that doesn't invalidate the claim that the main responsible party in the destruction of the country is the Syrian regime, which has allowed other parties to take advantage.",1368117698

Godel used pure logic to create an unprovable statement that was both true and false.

5681220,comment,5680850,5681164,10,0,codex,,,"My theory: it all comes down to the maturation of the underlying technology.  Tesla has been around for ten years.  Why is their mainstream car only coming to market now, after all that time?  Part of it is that creating a new car company takes a lot of time, but most of it is that the battery and other technologies have only recently matured enough to make EVs practical.  Tesla has been waiting and waiting until this occurred and has a small jump on the other manufacturers.  If this is true, I expect other manufacturers to ramp up pretty quickly.  Both GM and Nissan both have electric cars that outsell the Model S (at least for now).<p>Another aspect of the Model S worth mentioning is that EVs are heavily subsidized with a $7.5K federal tax credit a huge pile of cash from California--so Tesla has extra money to apply to the fit and finish of the car vis a vis non-electric luxury cars.  In fact, as of last quarter all of Tesla's profits came from selling ZEV credits to other auto manufacturers, not from the actual car itself.  Take out the $70M from selling ZEV credits and Tesla's gross margin is only 6%--much less than other luxury manufacturers.  In fact they'd be running at a $50M quarterly loss without them.  So it's easier to make a great car if you don't have to make as much money at it.  If Tesla manages to get their gross margin to 25% without these incentives, however, it will be a different story, and a remarkable feat.",1368116376

5681182,comment,5673628,5675135,1,0,isamuel,,,"I think you are entirely corerct.<p>The macro problem with most photo library software is that it's trying to do far too many things and ends up doing none particularly well. A photo library software suite generally enables:<p>1. Photo storage,\n2. Light photo editing (either of metadata or image data or both),\n3. Photo viewing (including basic slideshow functions, etc.),\n4. Photo organization (creation of albums, tagging people, and so on),\n5. Photo sharing (""post this album to Facebook"", etc.)<p>The problem is that no two of these tasks have a particularly logical relationship to one another. And as to most of them, there are better ways to do it.<p>As you note, we have put _enormous_ effort as a society into developing a very particular way to store blobs of data: the filesystem. It is a stable way. It is a well documented way. It is a way that has lots of tools that are also stable and well documented and mature. And best of all, it's really, really easy to back up. You can make copies of data on the filesystem in a trivial fashion. Back it up to an external drive! Back it up to a remote server, either owned by you or someone else! Encrypt the backups! Don't! It's easy. The same is true of photo editing, photo viewing, and many other things.<p>The one problem that photo libraries really solve is organization. It's nice to be able to make albums. It's nice to see all the photos taken around a similar time, or at a particular place, or with certain people in them. In fact, it's what makes huge collections workable. So I'm not knocking that. But what I am proposing is that there's got to be a way to disaggregate that singularly useful function from the mess of other things that photo library software doesn't need to do.<p>Note also that photos ought to be uncommonly easy to write organizational software for, because so many of them have built-in, well-documented metadata. Take a picture with your iPhone sometime and then dump the full EXIF info. There's a lot in there, way more than most people realize. And yet it's common to begin building photo library software by recreating all of that same information inside a proprietary and undocumented database. EXIF data includes a place for a description field---why doesn't photo library software _write to that?_ And files can have titles (or 'file names,' as they're called in the business)---why would you recreate, in some hidden-away SQLite database or something, the ""title"" attribute?",1368116057

Priestley succeeded so well because he developed simple, reproducible experiments (expose mercury oxide to sunlight to produce oxygen etc.) that he was happy to share for no financial gain (even traveling to others' labs to help them reproduce his work [1]). The current environment of paywalls and competitive grants seems hardly conducive to the rise of similar figures.<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experiments_and_Observations_on_Different_Kinds_of_Air#Discovery_of_oxygen"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experiments_and_Observations_on...</a>",1368115313

Tying all these text based interfaces together is a maintenace nightmare.<p>Maintenenace is a much bigger problem than the actual problems being solved, at least for businesses.<p>Then there's Lisp, which is a mini-language designer's tool kit <i>and</i> the super glue to tie them together all in one integrated package using a well designed, common binding agent.  Unfortunately the market has choosen not in it's favour.<p>The market will improve languages and in end game is that they'll all have the same features, and then it comes down to syntax and performance.   They'll all be 'better' by today's standards.  The problem is at that point is that the better bar will have moved.<p>And the guy that truly innovated during that time won't be found until the next century.",1368115309

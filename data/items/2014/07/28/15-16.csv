Realtors don&#x27;t have time for this nonsense.<p>If a Zestimate was too low (like my house), buyers would want to negotiate down under a fair market value. Again, realtors don&#x27;t have time for this kind of thing.<p>In either case, Zillow was skewing the market. And we&#x27;re not talking by a couple thousand dollars either, but on 20-40% swings.<p>In a neighborhood like mine, where the Zestimate is off by up to $100k from one house to the comparable one next door, the Zestimate becomes a hindrance on the fair market and causes more problems than it&#x27;s worth.<p>It&#x27;s like people getting medical advice off the internet, it&#x27;s better not to because it causes too many problems in the established industry and not in a good startup &quot;disruption&quot; sense but in a &quot;fucking everything up&quot; sense.<p>The reaction from local realtors has been pretty swift and strong against Zillow for these, among other reasons. In an area like mine, I&#x27;m not even sure what it&#x27;s useful for: the tax assessment fmv is wildly different, actual buy/sell prices are wildly different, it provides almost no value for pricing your own home to sell, and no value when buying a home that your local MLS doesn&#x27;t provide (and even worse it&#x27;s frequently wildly out of date). I suppose if I was looking for a rental it might provide some value, but the few rentals in my area have long since been occupied and Zillow still shows them up and available.<p>It&#x27;s basically the worst kind of disinformation, close enough to look reliable, but ultimately a waste of people&#x27;s time.",1406561722

Part of that is an inherent defensiveness about the tech industry being painted as discriminatory in this way. I get that, I guess -- it&#x27;s our corner of the world, full of people we like, we generally like to assume that the people we work with, in addition to doing good work, also treat people with equality.<p>It&#x27;s also because the speaker, and a lot of people around the speaker, assert (possibly correctly) that a) he (or she) does not discriminate against women and b) none of his (or her) colleagues are likely to.<p>But that downplay, and that dismissiveness, is its own kind of discrimination. Gender bias is not something that I have ever experienced as a man, and not something I have ever seen in the small (usually gender-balanced) companies I have worked in. But, just because I don&#x27;t see it (I&#x27;m not the one getting inappropriately hit on, or denied funding, etc.) doesn&#x27;t mean it isn&#x27;t very real. Sure, based on all the information I have of personal experience and the experience in the workplaces I have been in, this isn&#x27;t a problem -- but of course, it&#x27;s completely solipsistic to argue that my experience is any evidence of the wider state of things.<p>The shouting down of these stories is itself a worrying sign. If anyone feels like the culture they work in is treating them unfairly, maybe we should examine that closely, to figure out why they feel that way and what we (all of us) need to do that they don&#x27;t, rather than dismiss it as delusion or malice, and in so doing free ourselves of addressing it.",1406561674

You really have no idea what I think is important in life, so withhold your judgement.<p>You&#x27;re probably right that I overestimated the amount. Since frugal investing isn&#x27;t my goal in life, $5M was a made up figure. What I&#x27;m saying is that the number is higher than it might seem.<p>It depends on how aggressive you are with your financial planning. Remember, this is the <i>rest of your life</i> you&#x27;re planning for. Are you just going to get lattes and travel until you&#x27;re dead, or do you want to raise a family? Do you want your children to go to good schools? Do your projects require capital investment to be successful? Do you want to be an angel investor? Are you interested in philanthropy?<p>Counting on 6% interest in perpetuity is reasonable, but is probably more aggressive than I&#x27;d be willing to go. What happens if the stock market takes a dive? It&#x27;s not out of the realm of possibility that your net worth could be cut by 30-40%. That means that your interest income would be cut by the same amount.<p>Also, once you&#x27;re out of the industry, it&#x27;s hard to just come back and get another job. The software industry is pretty strong right now, but will it be in 10 or 20 years? Will you still have the skills you need to compete, after years of working on whatever you want to work on?<p>Let&#x27;s say your planning figure is 4% instead of 6%. Although $1M is a lot of money, if you&#x27;re talking about living off the interest, each $1M yields $40K gross a year at 4%. After 20% in capital gains taxes, it&#x27;s $32K. If you have to pay AMT (which you will, if you&#x27;re an American making money off of investments), expect an effective tax rate closer to 30%. This means that you can expect a net yield of $28K in interest per $1M of capital.<p>Also, remember, if you&#x27;re spending every cent of interest that your investments earn, they will never compound, and you will be at the mercy of inflation (about 2%) and your risk exposure will be dramatically higher. You should try to plan to have net income that you can reinvest.<p>$5M gives you $200K gross or $140K net. That&#x27;s a very handsome income, but if you want money to reinvest and you want to keep a conservative risk profile, it&#x27;s not Bugatti-Riviera money. If you&#x27;re willing to burn down your initial capital, it&#x27;s a lot easier, but then you have to consider your risk -- and whether you&#x27;re interested in leaving an inheritance.<p>Regardless of the actual amount you&#x27;re talking about saving, my point is that it&#x27;s probably more money than it seems like, and it takes a tremendous amount of time to save it working 9-5.",1406560961

8097203,comment,8095710,8096505,1,0,sophacles,,,"I find this comment amusing, because a recurring theme in the article is that of concern over the way many automated systems mine the past looking for discontinuities in politicians, criminals and &quot;potential criminals&quot; - that this does not allow growth or change of a person. In politics particularly I agree that this is dangerous - I want my politicians to be human - for it to be acceptable for them to change their opinions as their understanding changes, and as society changes around them. A strong requirement on rigidity and consistency of position is, to me, just as bad as a politician who has no opinion other than what the polls say that day. Rather than either I like a carefully considered opinion and position that acknowledges new data, and changes if necessary upon understanding said new data.  Further, I don&#x27;t mind if my politicians make mistakes, sometimes say stupid things, and occasionally show their human foibles - I think its awful to hold them to superhuman standards as we see a lot these days.<p>To address the last point: I know nothing inherent to the internet that requires a strongly consistent piece and prevents open discussion about a topic. Heck - there&#x27;s nothing inherent about the internet that requires it to be a debate. I&#x27;ve found debate tends to arise from proclamations of &quot;this is the truth&quot; rather than &quot;here&#x27;s what I&#x27;m thinking&quot; anyway - internet or no. The latter tends to just lead to discussion but unfortunately also draws people who try to discredit the author on inconsistencies because they mistake a &quot;my thinking right now&quot; piece for a proclamation of truth. I don&#x27;t think this is built into the internet, so much as a broader social issue or quirk of human psychology that causes or at least allows for that mistake. I lean towards a social issue of some sort that causes us to think everything people write is a proclamation of truths rather than a fundamental human thing - and that there is some psychological quirk that once someone is attacking a mistaken proclamation of truth it causes people to have to defend their team, rather than ignore the incorrect premise. I&#x27;ll admit it, I&#x27;ve done both before - but I&#x27;m not sure it was the right thing to do.",1406560559

That means that, while you <i>could</i> learn all the ins and outs of:\n- contracts (often regulated by the state)\n- negotiation (in whatever kind of market you are in--one favoring buyers or sellers\n- house value (both use and resale)\n- what can be changed about a house easily (finishes) and what is hard (layout) and what is nearly impossible (location)\n- neighborhood characteristics\n- typical home uses for people in your shoes now and in two years and five years, which might impact your purchase\n- the minutiae of a purchase (deadlines, appraisals, inspections, etc)<p>you might want to consider paying someone who does this <i>as their job</i> to help you out.<p>As for the &#x27;pumping up the price&#x27; to get paid more, or &#x27;making me hurry up&#x27; to get paid faster, there may be some agents that do this, but good ones are more concerned about the lifetime value of a consumer, which can easily run into mid five figures (if you move every 7 years starting at 28 and ending at 70, and buy the median house price (~200k) and use the same agent every time at 3% commission, that is 36k in commission).<p>It&#x27;s dumb to burn a customer for a few hundred bucks when their LTV is ~40k (if you pay 210k for a house when it is really worth 200k, the agent earns 6300 instead of 6000).",1406560408

Many of the comments I received on that post illustrate one of the big problems with evaluating NoSQL - there are a million niche solutions and the common guidance is “it depends on what you need”. Even if you know what you need, it takes significant research and understanding to know if a particular NoSQL engine is right or wrong for that need. You can’t possibly evaluate them all, there are far too many.&quot;<p>I don&#x27;t understand this approach at all.  You want to investigate using a NoSQL solution. Why?  You know that you need to do research and evaluation but you give up because there are too many choices? You&#x27;ve heard that you have to compromise on transactions and add application complexity, so you stick with &quot;good old SQL&quot;.<p>I&#x27;m not sure what this article is advocating.

I meant the world&#x27;s currency like the gold was for many years, or the dollar is nowadays. You used to be able to go anywhere and either buy things with gold or exchange it fairly easily for local currency. Same thing happens nowadays with the dollar. However, the American dollar is losing its preponderance in world trade. The Chinese are pushing really hard to fill that spot with the yuan, this is one of the reasons behind their recent gold fever. [1] Even though, they don&#x27;t have a gold backed yuan, and probably never will. Gold reserves, together with foreign exchange reserves[2] make a currency stronger, since in case that the Yuan starts to depreciate the Chinese Government can always sell those reserves and buy Yuan&#x27;s increasing it&#x27;s demand and consequently increasing its price.<p>>What is the subject that I should study to understand all of this and stop asking a question like that?<p>I have an economics background, and I&#x27;ve studied some finance, but I don&#x27;t think I can give you a good enough answer. If you are really interested I rather you looked online or asked somewhere else (maybe reddit?). Nevertheless the straightforward answer is: Monetary Policy. However, in order to get into monetary policy, I believe that you&#x27;d probably need to know the basics about economics, the Mankiw is a good start [4]. Afterwards, I would suggest you to read something from Taleb, maybe The Black Swan, since economics it&#x27;s full of BS, and this book will serve as a compass. Finally, I would advise you to take the class: Economics of Money and Banking [6] from Columbia on Coursera.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.ibtimes.com/chinas-gold-fever-rises-showing-no-signs-abating-golden-week-holiday-kicks-1413202"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ibtimes.com/chinas-gold-fever-rises-showing-no-si...</a><p>[2] China has the highest foreign exchange reserve in the world <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_exchange_reserves_of_the_People&#x27;s_Republic_of_China"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_exchange_reserves_of_th...</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monetary_policy"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monetary_policy</a><p>[4] <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Principles-Economics-N-Gregory-Mankiw/dp/0538453052"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Principles-Economics-N-Gregory-Mankiw/...</a> If you are interested don&#x27;t get scared  by the price tag, buy any older editions which are almost as good as this one and will cost you a fraction.<p>[5] <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/The-Black-Swan-Improbable-Robustness/dp/081297381X"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/The-Black-Swan-Improbable-Robustness/d...</a><p>[6] <a href=""https://class.coursera.org/money-002"" rel=""nofollow"">https://class.coursera.org/money-002</a>",1406559741

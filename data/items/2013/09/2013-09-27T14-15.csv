Perhaps it was more responsible to avoid investing millions of dollars and years of effort in an over-architected system and just ship something quick and dirty, and see if people like it.

It&#x27;s not easy, but it works.<p>For a while I tried a very simple policy:<p>You come in when you want and go home when you want.  Take as long as you want for lunch.  Got errands to run that are important to you?  Don&#x27;t ask me, go do it.  Need to go out of town to see a concert in the middle of the week?  Have a good time.  Bring pictures.  In general, everyone in this group was allowed to be an adult and manage their time as they wished.  There was no such thing as vacation time or sick time accounting.  If you need time off, take it.<p>The only requirement was that the work get done, get done well and on time (within a schedule that was discussed by all and agreed-upon).<p>That&#x27;s it.<p>What happened?  Well, a few people abused it.  They tended to be in the younger end of the spectrum and perhaps thought this was a license to fuck off and get paid.  They didn&#x27;t last long.  The rest of this small group was great.  They got their work done without a lot of supervision, were happy and actually went out of their way to push the project forward.  It was an excellent experience and a great way, as far as I am concerned, to filter the idiots from the professionals.<p>This isn&#x27;t easy to manage.  That seems like an oxymoron.  You are not actively managing people yet you say that it is hard to manage?  Well, the problem is it takes a little bit of time to settle into a stable state.  Every addition or change to the team creates a step change that needs to be allowed to settle.  Once you have a stable team it pretty much runs itself and it runs well.  Until then it can be a little chaotic.<p>I&#x27;ve done this once and was happy with the results.  When you are under the gun and trying to put together a new team it is easier to go with a more conventional top-down approach and pretty much dictate what each person needs to do, when, how, etc.  Not the best environment but sometimes you have no choice.<p>That said, in general terms I firmly believe in making people responsible for an area or reaching a certain milestone and pretty much leaving them alone.  They should come to you if they need help or guidance.  Other than that, if you are working with professionals there should not be any need to hover over them every day to see how they are doing.",1380293079

If on the other hand I do work for someone without an agreement, say spontaneously sweep the leaves off some corporation&#x27;s parking lot or make them a website, then obviously I can only hope but not really expect to get paid.<p>By the way, I think that was exactly the point Mike Monteiro was trying to make in his &quot;Fuck you, pay me&quot; talk.<p>> When you make a non fair-use copy that, by law, triggers a financial obligation to the author<p>This is not correct and is exactly what i meant by backwards.<p>The way it works is that I pay the rights-holder agreed upon sum and THEN am awarded the right to make a copy.

Do you for instance believe that copyright infringement is to blame for the decline of newspapers?<p>Comparing a producer of tangible goods of which there is a real scarcity with one who of intangible works which are only artificially scarce, is in my opinion a fallacy that does little to illuminate the issue.

Why is it that skeptics are dismissed at best as ignorant or stupid, as paid shills for big oil, or even terrorists.  I&#x27;m skeptical of at least some climate change claims, but I don&#x27;t feel like I&#x27;m stupid or ignorant or a terrorist.  Instead, I constantly hear confused or misleading statements about the environment, often stated with a religious fervor that characterizes those who doubt as sinners.<p>While at happy-hour, a friend&#x27;s boyfriend started complaining about how much waste there was in some pizza box.  So far, I&#x27;m at least partially on-board with what he&#x27;s saying, but then it goes off into alarmist claims about landfills.  Now, I&#x27;m starting to realize that he hasn&#x27;t really read anything about the subject (I read a lot).  So I say, &quot;Well, it&#x27;s probably not the world&#x27;s biggest problem, there&#x27;s not a shortage of holes in the ground.&quot;  He end&#x27;s up getting mad and casting aspersions. (The best being that he accuses me of being a &quot;Capitalist&quot;).<p>At a party I&#x27;m talking to a self-identified &quot;geologist&quot;.  He&#x27;s talking about global warming and loss of glaciers, etc.  I say, &quot;Isn&#x27;t it weird that that&#x27;s going on while central Antarctica is actually cooling?&quot;.  His response was &quot;Oh, well of course, warming can cause that too.&quot;  He was a nice enough guy, but I notice that it didn&#x27;t matter what direction the temperature of Antarctica was heading, to him, it confirmed his belief.<p>I really like Phil Plat&#x27;s Bad Astronomy, but even his recent post makes me wonder: he notes that temperatures haven&#x27;t headed up as the models predict, but oh this isn&#x27;t really a problem the heat has decided to go into the oceans.  He says &quot;it&#x27;s observed&quot; and not at all a new idea &quot;we&#x27;ve known&quot; this.  Well I follow the link [1] and the way I read the web page is that top 700 meters of the ocean haven&#x27;t warmed (hmm..), oh but the next 800 meters have and below that, well, we don&#x27;t know or we don&#x27;t understand or it doesn&#x27;t seem to matter.  This is so weak and unconvincing that I turn to another link in Phil&#x27;s blog post, the &quot;it&#x27;s observed&quot; link [2].  I don&#x27;t get very far with this one either because this page says:<p><pre><code>    If the oceans are warming up, this implies that the Earth must absorb more solar energy 
    than it emits long-wave radiation into space. This is the only possible heat source. 
    Thats simply the first law of thermodynamics, conservation of energy. This conservation 
    law is why physicists are so interested in looking at the energy balance of anything. 
    Because we understand the energy balance of our Earth, we also know that global warming 
    is caused by greenhouse gases  which have caused the largest imbalance in the radiative 
    energy budget over the last century. 
</code></pre>
This is just such horse-poop.  The author is trying to impress us with (the scary word) &quot;thermodynamics&quot; and (wow) what &quot;physicists&quot; are interested in while telling us that this &quot;is this only possible heat source&quot;.  What happened to the heat generated by radioactive decay of the earths isotopes or primordial heat from the earth&#x27;s core, these certainly affect the earth&#x27;s heat balance.  See what physicsworld.com has to say about this [3].  That web page sites a study claiming that about 50% of the heat given off by the earth is from radioactive decay.  The page&#x27;s author might be right about the oceans absorbing heat, but this doesn&#x27;t sound like a real scientist speaking.<p>This is how it goes.  I see journalists, newscasters, everyday friends and associates making uneducated and unscientific statements, while accusing skeptics of being flat-earthers.  Every storm, every tornado, every hot summer afternoon (or cold winter morning) further justifies their belief in dangerous climate change.  Even though they know nothing of the science behind climate and the real challenges of moving our planet to a more sustainable future.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.skepticalscience.com/Ocean-Heat-Content-And-The-Importance-Of-The-Deep-Ocean.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.skepticalscience.com/Ocean-Heat-Content-And-The-I...</a>

That may be a valid reason to pick Java (I&#x27;ve picked PHP in the past, despite preferring Ruby, exactly based on the availability of &quot;good enough&quot; developers versed in the language).<p>As for the Twitter example, pretty much everything that has been publicly discussed about their original RoR app made it sound like a god-awful abomination in terms of architecture. OF COURSE it didn&#x27;t scale. It seems to me at least that blaming Rails or Ruby or both is just a convenient way to avoid responsibility for the architecture and/or a convenient excuse for people that wanted to switch to Java/Scala/Clojure to use to justify the rewrites.<p>I&#x27;ve posted examples in the past on how they <i>could</i> have scaled it using Ruby, based on my own experiences with pure-Ruby queueing systems that would&#x27;ve been &quot;simple&quot; to scale even to their current size. As I&#x27;ve also pointed out, the primary thing they were trying to scale - messaging with potentially massive fan-out - is a well understood and &quot;solved&quot; problem: Turn your flat distribution lists into trees where each recipient is either a follower or the location of a subtree, and you can scale it arbitrarily. In practice, only a very small percentage of their users are &quot;special&quot; enough to require the &quot;tree&quot; treatment, to the point where you can handle it as a special sub-system.<p>[Heck, you could scale the foundation of Twitter with a bunch of mail servers and shell scripts to manage forwarding lists (no, it would not be costs-effective, but I <i>have</i> done high volume message queueing with mail servers before).]<p>Note that I&#x27;m not saying that another language might not be better for them - at their scale, it pays to optimise things that&#x27;d be a rounding error in a smaller environment - but at least their original RoR complaints were ludicrously off the mark. They might very well have valid reasons for switching, but the reasons they used to give were not it.",1380292623

More man hours are devoted to managing their operations than putting a rover on fucking Mars. This makes them extraordinarily efficient. Things that don&#x27;t sell are pushed out for things that do, giving people exactly what they want, when they want it.<p>They also know that they only need to have, on average, four checkouts open from the hours of 8-6, Monday through Friday, so there is no inefficiency when it comes to staffing, either.<p>Meanwhile at Mom and Pop&#x27;s Five and Dime, inventory is brought in once a week on a truck, and if they got rid of cereal X and moved the milk over two aisles how much would their sales increase? Who the hell knows? They are just doing what has worked for the past 40 years. But it&#x27;s okay, because shoppers in the area like them and because there isn&#x27;t any meaningful competition, they can just use cost-based pricing to guarantee a satisfactory margin and keep themselves in business.<p>Unfortunately in this scenario, local town inhabitants are paying for this inefficiency. When Wal-Mart moves in and gives the consumers more choice at lower prices, Wal-Mart robs Mom and Pop of their margin, keeps a little of it, and gives the rest to the consumers. Your wages aren&#x27;t 20% lower just because Wal-Mart ironed out a huge producer surplus. You are wealthier because you can go to the mall and buy a quality shirt for $30 that was made for about two bucks whereas before you would have had to make your own shirt which might take you most of a day.

6457128,comment,6455269,6455269,43,0,sequoia,,,"My take on why imgur is on top (I&#x27;ve been using & evangelizing it for a couple years): They initially picked one thing (image hosting) and did <i>everything</i> possible to remove barriers & friction to getting that task done.<p>Ways to upload to imgur include clicking upload button, using file dialog; dragging and dropping onto the webpage; OSX dashboard widget (used this one when I was on mac); windows context menu (right click send to imgur); chrome extension; FF extension; bash script; wordpress plugin... basically any way you can think of, you can put images on imgur <i>quickly</i>.  Oh and not blocking 3rd party referrers, and actually doing a good job of handling images makes a big difference.  To the latter point: I was uploading images from iOS to wordpress but the orientation was in the EXIF data.  WP ignored this so my images were rotated the wrong way... use `convert` to fix them 1x1 = pain in the ass.  Select images, drag/drop onto desktop, group as album... surprise surprise: imgur orients the pictures properly automatically.<p>The UX on imgur is what I&#x27;d call a case study of good UX, basically the best I&#x27;ve seen on any website. Kudos to imgur, they deserve all the success they&#x27;re getting. /fanrant",1380291683

On the surface, it may look like something that easily be replicated by a simple blog or Tumblr account, but that&#x27;s definitely not the case.<p>They seamlessly integrate the status history as well as letting us easily post to Twitter when there is a problem. They also provide a feed and reliable infrastructure separate from our own that integrates with monitoring tools.<p>When your app is offline, it&#x27;s a huge relief to be able to easily update Twitter and have a central location for clear status information without having to go to Twitter and Tumblr or wherever and tie everything together.<p>It&#x27;s certainly not cheap, but compared to building, hosting, and maintaining an equivalent service, it&#x27;s a great deal. Some of their more advanced features, like allowing customers to sign up for text alerts are great as well if you need it.<p>The service is way more than just a hosted Tumblr account, and I&#x27;d definitely recommend them if you&#x27;re looking for something like this.",1380290810

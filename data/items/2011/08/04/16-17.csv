2846755,comment,2846549,2846636,3,0,yichi,,,"As an administrator on Wikipedia, I thought the Wikipedia notability criteria is quite leniant about articles which are not that notable, this is evident if you ever look at what kind of articles gets kept on [[WP:AFD]]. The reason notability criteria is there so not everyone can create an article about their band which sold 3 copies of their CD (edit: Which typically have no realiable sources indicating its existance). If the article you are creating was deleted for not meeting the notability criteria, it means you probably did not source it with a reliable source, and the administartor who deleted it could not find a reliable source about the article you were writing.<p>If you think your article's deletion need to be reviewed, try contacting one of the admins, if your article was deleted by me I would be more than happy to tell you why I deleted it, and if I made a mistake I would not hestitate to revert the deletion.",1312477177

They're a middle ground between GUI and command line (stretching the definition of middle ground a little). But my personal experience with people like my parents and even sometimes colleagues who use computers more than 3-4 hrs a day as part of their job is that there is a big aversion to keyboard shortcuts. I can't imagine how Ctrl-C and Ctrl-V are in any sense harder than painfully clicking 2-3 times through hierarchical menus, but somehow my anecdotal experience leads me to believe that people just don't value time efficiency in a way power users do (or maybe that can be used to define power users).<p>Maybe understanding why keyboard shortcuts are used so little might help us understand why the command line has lesser adoption among the non-power users.",1312477160

Live Better."" It isn't obviously true that living better follows saving money -- perhaps the money is better spent for a premium product. Yet the logo, essentially big text that says ""Walmart,"" is very obviously true: It's a big store called Walmart.<p>Logos generally don't make a statement and there's nothing to disagree with. So when you're shown a logo, you're free to draw on your own interpretation of the brand, but when your shown a slogan, you often experience this dissonance, which manifests as distrust.* Similarly, even the word ""slogan"" is enough to trigger this distrust, since you've been lied to so frequently in the past. I'd be curious how the effect differs from a true slogan, like ""we are farmers,"" vs an untrue one like ""the ultimate driving machine.""<p>*Note that the above is essentially ""The Law of Candor,"" from the classic book, The 22 Immutable Laws of Marketing by Al Reis and Jack Trout.",1312476936

2846724,comment,2845717,2846414,3,0,pak,,,"Chrome runs a separate process for each tab, and that process includes the layout engine and the JS engine (V8) running in tandem.  V8 has to be able to block the layout engine from rendering, otherwise it will draw invalid page states.  The execution model (greatly oversimplifying) is that the browser runs a tight loop that monitors for changes to the DOM state and input events, and then synchronously executes JS code bound to these events (and the native handlers if they are not overridden), finally re-rendering parts of the viewport that become ""dirty"".<p>In a browser that isolates tabs into their own processes, like Chrome, try opening a tab for www.google.com and then enter this in your address bar:<p><pre><code>    javascript:document.getElementById('lst-ib').onclick=function(){while(1);}\n</code></pre>\nWhen you click on the search box the entire tab will freeze, because the tab process is stuck inside the JS engine running the infinite loop function we bound to the click handler.  It's not a matter of bad browser design, that's how the JS execution model is intended to work.<p>""Web workers"" is the HTML5 proposal for running JS code that does not block the event loop.  They do not have direct access to the DOM and can only communicate with JS code in the main event loop via a message passing API.",1312476876

There was a study at some point that Wikimedia commissioned that found that most educated Hindi-speakers preferred to read and contribute to the English Wikipedia.

Another reason is that a lot of higher education in India is in English already.<p>(Also, anecdotally, the South Indians I know would rather use English than Hindi; their own native-language Wikipedias, like Kannada, are too small for them to consider them viable, and they see English as more ""neutral"" than Hindi in domestic political terms.)",1312476794

It was purely a defensive play.<p>Second, by not joining in the bidding Google overplayed how much they are worried about these patents and other patents held by the members of the consortium.  Things like that are what drives up prices.  And it's like blood in water.  Companies can smell when they know you have a weakness.<p>Google should have just taken these patents off the table, and then continue to fight their current battles.<p>Now they have their current battles to fight.  AND they have 882 Novell patents that they can be hit with.  Then 6000 Nortel patents.  Whoever is running Google's IP planning I think needs to be replaced.",1312476496

It's not because the Fed is corrupt, though.  It's because <i>that's how bad the economy is.</i><p>Normally, banks will happily lend money.  But when the risk of default is greater, as it is in a recession, banks are stingy with loans: they only loan to those with better credit-- and at a higher interest rate.<p>Bank liquidity is so tight right now (yes, it's their own fault) and the economic outlook so dim that if they had their druthers, banks wouldn't lend at all.  If that happened, the economy would have an even worse outlook.<p>Luckily, the Fed can encourage banks to lend by giving them a discount on money (usually around 0.25%).  Right now, however, the Fed can't give a discount because the rate is <i>already at 0%</i>.  Thus, the present situation of the Fed basically throwing money at the banks, begging them to lend it out to the broader economy.<p>This is what is known as an edge case.<p>Don't like it?  Join the club.  What's happened since 2008 has sickened the remaining responsible, ethical folks managing the economy.  But it's not right to impugn the Fed with the actions of a few irresponsible investment banks.  If you read Sorkin's account in <i>Too Big to Fail</i> it's plain to see how Paulson and Geithner's actions amounted to making the best of a bad situation.

Giving us a new number for what their business looks like now is ridiculous""<p>A thousand times, yes!<p>Investors need baseline, objective, bottom-line numbers to work with. These numbers help potential investors evaluate where the business is at today, and (perhaps more importantly) help current investors evaluate whether the past projections met with reality.<p>There are plenty of places that companies are able to spin the numbers to tell their story of fabulous fortunes and world conquest. But there are certain places where you have to let the tried-and-true numbers speak for themselves without someone standing in front waving their arms.<p>It's like going to vegas. It's easy to say: ""Hey, I about broke even. Even if I did lose a little money on the tables, I got some free drinks and I had fun this weekend.""

This is a key organization that governs most aspects of the countrys airports and air travel safety.  Basically, beginning four years ago, Congress has been passing temporary financing measures to keep the FAA afloat.  When one plan ran its course, a new temporary fix was put in place.  Well the most recent measure expired last month, and a temporary financing plan was passed by the House, but stopped by negotiations in the Senate.  There were a few contentious points including: (i) $14 million subsidy for commercial air service to rural airports and (ii) the bills anti-union legislation which the GOP claims that major airlines like Delta support.  Essentially, it looks like Senate Republicans are willing to shut down the FAA in order to get its union-busting language through.<p>The result of all of this is that 4,000 workers have been furloughed (fancy word for unemployed at the moment) and airport safety inspectors have been asked to continue working without pay to keep airports operating safely.  While most people might consider this a ridiculous ask, the FAA administrator, Randy Babbitt, asserts that the inspectors should definitely work without pay, as ""we are depending and living on their professionalism at this point.""  In addition to the temporary unemployment, if this stalemate lasts until labor day, analysts estimate that it will cost the government up to $1 billion in lost tax revenues.  Each day, the government is losing $30 million.  The fact that a $14 million subsidy could be holding up a deal that is costing the country $30 million a day seems a bit odd. In a time when government leaders are preaching cost cutting and curbing spending, another reckless stalemate that is costing this country financially should be enough to force a deal as soon as possible.",1312475385

Still, I didn't know until today that you could link to individual figures and exercises, it will be even more fun to cite it in a quasi-religious, trollish way.<p>Also, you generalized the principle (and fused two exercises of the book in one :), or at least I'll have to believe you ;) I didn't form really much of an intuition on eigenvectors during the completely proper Linear Algebra course that I took, which is only my fault.<p>But I think that the exercise serves to reinforce the underlying theme that with enough attention, one can either supply or draw the insight to chip away yet one more part of the problem, to attack it from another angle, to pull it from just another direction that one had not seen before. It celebrates cleverness and knowledge, used to make complex things simple, to find the easy way out the hard way and end up better in the end, and that's partly why it's so cherished, but we all know that.",1312474454

Save mathematical purity for after you get 'em hooked.<p>I've heard: ""Oh, but if have them program in BASIC we're doing irreperable harm!""<p>Horsepucky. I'd rather have an ex-BASIC hacker at my side, helping me ship, than someone who can't write a hundred line program without dragging in declarations that nobody will be able to understand a week later. The best engineers I know weren't hurt by exposure to BASIC, or assembly; they were good at everything.<p>I guess I'm just a greasemonkey with a keyboard.<p>[I love Scheme, btw. I don't get functional languages that think it's okay to ditch the programs-as-data paradigm.]",1312473881

It seems obvious to me that the same situation can happen during normal development on the head branch. A bit less obvious but still clear in my mind is that semantic conflicts can occur anytime a developer's assumptions about the code base are wrong.<p>Yes, static typing fixes problems with changing function signatures but that's only the first step of the way. The next step is to start thinking about and defining modules (files, classes, whatever) in semantic terms.<p>I haven't heard it discussed in a few years but the discussions around the Liskov substitution principle and Liskov/Wing semantic typing highlights the difficulties of adding semantics to everyday software development practices.",1312473619

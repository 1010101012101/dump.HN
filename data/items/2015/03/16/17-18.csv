Least of all because you can buy direct from the OEM rather than through a reseller (who profits), and also because the buyer has more leverage for negotiations (that&#x27;s a lot of money, and they COULD go elsewhere).<p>Second problem: The servers don&#x27;t need to be identical, and in fact Amazon&#x27;s EC2 instances aren&#x27;t identical (they just pretend to be). If you spin up several EC2 instances over a few weeks then look at e.g. the CPU info, you&#x27;ll see that they vary quite a lot but are similar-ish (this has caused people issues when they&#x27;re using on-demand instances and their software relies on specific CPU features, in particular when those features only exist on current-gen CPUs).<p>PS - Also 10,000 is not even ballpark how many physical servers Amazon has (try 450,000).<p>> When it comes to labor cost - if you have enough hardware for at least one full time datacenter tech, you&#x27;re in the same boat as Amazon.<p>I highly doubt that. Amazon&#x27;s scale allows them to develop better automation, detection, and procedures in general which allows the number of staff per server to be very low. For example, a single dedicated tech&#x27; might be able to handle 10-30 servers MAYBE, whereas at Amazon that might be just a single rack and effectively each tech might be responsible for hundreds of physical machines (even if automation does the lion&#x27;s share of the heavy lifting).<p>> So you&#x27;re paying Amazon to do the same work you would do otherwise - only you&#x27;re subject to their rules and procedures and Amazon being a profitable business needs to mark their services up.<p>I will fully admit that a company like SoftLayer (per the article) can give Amazon&#x27;s EC2 a run for its money. However as someone who&#x27;s seen the costs associated with running servers in house (in particular staffing costs) I struggle to buy that you can under-cut Amazon by doing so (at least until you have a LOT of servers, and even then frankly it is less hassle to out-source it anyway).<p>There are legitimate arguments for why you&#x27;d want to do so e.g. privacy, security, legal reasons, unique hardware/OS, etc. However if you&#x27;re just doing something generic like web-host+database, then out-sourcing it to a dedicated company is more cost effective. In particular when you start looking at the hidden costs of internal hosting (like office space, heating/electricity, security, and so on).",1426528687

9213076,comment,9211832,9211832,0,0,blixt,,,"I would agree with this article that every independent solution today does not have the slightest chance to be iteratively improved to some kind of real intelligence. Even the &quot;generic&quot; game playing AI is very limited outside the scope of a pixel buffer and some digital output signals.<p>However, I don&#x27;t understand how the arguments correlate to &quot;there is no need to worry about AI&quot;. The real worry should come from the fact that there are now many, many more people looking at the problem of AI than before, and it&#x27;s a competition that now has serious money behind it.<p>The article mentioned the infinite monkey theorem as a counterargument, but ironically that is exactly how I think we will stumble upon generic intelligence. The more people that work on it and have the confidence, belief, and money to actually try out random things, the more likely it is that someone out there will discover the step change that will, in a day, take AI from deep prediction algorithms to eerily deliberate behavior.<p>Even if no one manages to shortcut our way to generic intelligence, we sure as hell will brute force it. While we&#x27;re extremely early in the world of simulating organic brains, they exist. People have constructed virtual organic bodies controlled by virtual electric currents from virtual neurons in virtual brains. It&#x27;s happening today, and as capacity, domain knowledge, and most importantly awareness increases, more and more people will work on the problem and bigger and bigger brains will be simulated.<p>I really don&#x27;t see how we can question whether we will eventually reach human level intelligence running on computers. The only way I see generic machine intelligence <i>not</i> happening is by making people believe it is so impossible that no one ever tries to do it.

Nowadays you see an almost perfect drop in traffic when switching off a load balancer. Only bots and some weird exotic ISPs may keep sending traffic to a disabled box for up to an hour or two, but since DNS LB is only used to handle real emergency outages and for planned maintenance we could move LB IPs around, I really do not see it as a big enough issue to stop using the DNS LB magic :-)",1426528617

If you buy 1, brokerage costs are high compared to your investment. If you buy 100, you still get the shares from the top of the order book, and fees become negligible. Buy 10M, and you will pay much-much more per share because supply is not going to be there.<p>Just think of the simple supply-demand curve. As demand increases, price increases as well. The bulk discount pricing is only valid for amounts that provide better utilization of the supply chain. If Intel can produce 1M chips a month, then if somebody orders the last 50k, he might get a discount.

They bear almost all of the financial responsibility for this attempt to make housing affordable. Home owners don&#x27;t, and employers and employees don&#x27;t. And the subsidy is incredibly unevenly applied: You get more a subsidy the longer you&#x27;ve been in a rental, it&#x27;s not dependent on how much you need the subsidy.<p>As long as the city deems it beneficial to have a rental subsidy, they should just go ahead and have a real subsidy paid by taxes, and get rid of rent control. There&#x27;s a good argument that a diverse population is good for  the the city, so a subsidy funded by income, sales, corporate, property, and hotel tax makes a lot of sense.",1426528355

I would expect a significant portion of any densely populated city to be paved, for the simple reason that people need to be able to get to essentially every part of a city. Short of more fanciful solutions like fully elevated or underground passageways, you&#x27;re going to need roughly the same <i>grid</i> of roads even if you eliminate cars. Granted, you could theoretically get significant constant factor reduction in the width of roads if you can remove lanes (through banning cars, encouraging carpooling/public transit, or increasing bicyclists and pedestrians).",1426527835

At this stage you just is it as an easy way to get a set of Linux computers connected to the Internet.<p>When you get to a point where you feel like this whole thing is going to fly, I&#x27;d recommend starting to think if paying the &quot;cloud tax&quot; (resources spent around EC2 stability issues and the cloud-specific stuff) a good idea in your particular case. There are some companies that benefit greatly from the elasticity of the cloud (the ability to scale up and down along with their specific load demands), but many companies aren&#x27;t like that. If your traffic is relatively stable and predictable (you do not have 10-100x traffic surges) and your infrastructure load does not grow linearly with the traffic, using real hardware over-provisioned to handle 2-5-10x traffic spikes without huge decrease in performance may be a better idea in terms of the cost.<p>Of course, you could start the company based on all of the PaaS magic sauce (databases, queues, caches, etc) provided by Amazon nowadays and only use EC2 to run your application code (AFAIU that&#x27;s the ideal use-case for AWS) and just kill misbehaving nodes when an issue occurs, but then you need to factor AWS costs into your business plan because migrating away from a PaaS is almost impossible at any large scale, so you are going to stay with Amazon for a very long time.",1426527759

I&#x27;m pretty sure I&#x27;ve read Oculus docs outright discouraging standing experiences - safety concerns and the like, saying they&#x27;re not currently interested in accepting them, at least insisting on a reasonable sitting experience.<p>Even if Oculus Rift weren&#x27;t the early mover here, I think a lot of games will be targeting the &quot;lowest common denominator&quot;.  They might support physically standing up and walking around in a room, or using 3d controllers, but they&#x27;ll also support sitting down with a traditional keyboard+mouse setup.<p>Eventually, we&#x27;ll see games that assume a standing experience - like the existing games based on the Kinect, Wii balance pad, etc. - but I don&#x27;t see them being the majority anytime soon (and a number of those can probably be sanely adapted not to require it as well.)",1426527452

The program is essentially: transform the input structure to another structure to another structure.  All the structures are publicly defined making it really easy to understand the program and debug when things go wrong.  The flow of execution is simple and obvious, and the compiler picks up possible errors in that flow because of the strong typing.<p>But there happened to be one place that I wanted the ability to hide data + use implicit variant code alongside that data, and then I switched over to using objects[3].

They may be working, so they can&#x27;t practice. They may have diminishing returns from practicing and simply want to live their lives.

It may take a while, especially if there&#x27;s a big talent gap, but eventually the practice is more important than the innate talent.",1426526349

If a landlord has a few different units, some under rent control, some not, and some cash to spend on improvements, why would he spend it on improving the rent-controlled units? The Facebook post that was here yesterday even said so much:<p>> The few of us who still remain in San Francisco have no choice but to live in sub-par conditions like mold, windows that don&#x27;t shut, rodents and countless other issues because there is no other choice, because the rents are so high you can&#x27;t move so you don&#x27;t.<p>This is what you get when you set the price artificially below market value: subpar product. Has anyone here seen Soviet-era apartments? They were exactly like this. So in the long run, the place will fall apart around the renter, and they will be pretty much powerless to do anything about it. And the bit about &quot;can&#x27;t move&quot; because it&#x27;s too expensive just means that the area is now too expensive for you and rent-control is the only thing allowing you to stay here.<p>If the excuse is that your job is here, well maybe your job is not paying you enough to live in SF.

Superintelligence, while an interesting book, doesn&#x27;t do much more than pontificate on sci-fi futures based largely on writing from Yudkowski. Bostrom gives no clear pathway to AGI. Neither does Yudkowski in his own writings or Barrat (Our final invention). By the way Super intelligence is kind of an offshoot book from Global Catastrophic Risks.<p>All of them take these interesting approaches, WBE, BCI, AGI etc... and just assume they will achieve the goal without looking realistically about where the field is or how it would get there.<p>So what they do is they say: We are here right now. In some possible fantasy world we could be there. The problem is they can&#x27;t draw the dots between them.<p>For example, find me someone who can tell me what kind of hardware we need for an AGI. Can&#x27;t do it, because no one has any idea. What about interface, what is the interface for an AGI?<p>Even better (this was my thesis project): What group would have a strong enough requirement that an AGI would be required to build? Industry, Academia, Military? Ok great, can they get funding or resources for it?<p>etc...<p>Note, I am not saying that there is no potential that AGI could be a problem. The point here is that nobody has firm footing to say that it will definitely be a huge risk and that we need to regulate it&#x27;s development.<p>There are actually people calling for legislation to prevent/slow AGI development - see Altman&#x27;s blog post and many of the writings on MIRI. So that is what I am rallying against.<p>We need more development into AGI not less.",1426525277

9212657,comment,9191151,9191858,0,0,tripzilch,,,"> > Oh c&#x27;mon, he ordered a hitman inside a play the FBI fully staged for him. There was never any harm done to anybody.<p>> I&#x27;m not sure this line of reasoning makes a lot of difference. We judge criminal intent, not simply outcome, and it&#x27;s pretty clear that the intent in hiring a hitman is to have someone killed - staged or not. It&#x27;s surely different from pulling the trigger yourself, but I think it&#x27;s quite fair to expect a gut-check moment when one decides not to pay for murder, and to hold someone criminally accountable for ignoring that gut-check and deciding to go ahead with the hit anyway.<p>But the FBI could basically do this to anyone: try and convince them using a play that involves fabricated emotional pressure, blackmail and, if some other comments are correct (I haven&#x27;t followed the case that closely), even inventing physical danger and multiple other people&#x27;s lives being on the line.<p>The FBI could do this to anyone, do you think it&#x27;s fair or desirable that <i>anyone</i> that <i>could</i> be tricked into agreeing to hire a (fictional) hitman should in fact be charged with that crime and put into jail for the rest of their lives? Because I think that would be a <i>lot</i> of people you&#x27;d pre-emptively have to put in jail. Especially if they deliberately put in the classic moral dilemma of saving a whole bunch of people&#x27;s lives from being destroyed versus killing the single person responsible.<p>How many people would make the same decision if confronted with this circumstance? Should they all be put in jail, just for the fact that they would&#x27;ve made that choice if it had been real? Because I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s a very good &quot;test&quot; for detecting &quot;bad people&quot; or people that are really dangerous for society. You can argue about the moral choice (since those victims would merely &quot;have their lives ruined&quot;, not be actually killed), but as presented I think it&#x27;s a really difficult dilemma, and I couldn&#x27;t really fault a person for choosing one way or another. It&#x27;s a terrible moral dilemma that I personally just hope to never have to face in my life.<p>So, having argued that <i>any</i> random person who would make this choice is not necessarily so bad they should be convicted, what differentiates Ross Ulbricht? Seems that, in this particular context, his &quot;crime&quot; was that because of his involvements, he was a person likely to <i>actually</i> face this dilemma situation at some point in his Silk Road career. That seems about the only reason to expose Ulbricht to this moral dilemma situation, instead of just any (or every) random person on the streets.<p>So then, really, is it reasonable to entrap and then convict someone because they are involved in business that <i>may</i> likely at some point in the future lead to a situation where they would have to make choices like these?<p>To repeat, if the hitman thing had just been about offing a competitor for financial or business gains, my whole argument above doesn&#x27;t hold. But they actively put him in a situation where there was no <i>moral</i> right answer, and then convicted him for it.<p><i>EDIT:</i> if this is true then that rather changes the whole story: <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=9192416"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=9192416</a>",1426525231

I&#x27;m definitely going to transition to ES6 modules soon.<p>The infrastructure is the important piece, not the module syntax. Webpack provides this infrastructure, and it&#x27;s easy to provide it for ES6 modules as well.<p>For example: how do I hot reload modules? How do I eval code inside a module? Webpack allows you to do all of this, and is more advanced than anything out there.

Do you know how much you get from that small config?

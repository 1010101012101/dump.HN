8694021,comment,8693478,8693970,0,0,lhnz,,,"I have a Github and I actually have a few public projects but the vast amount of my work is private.<p>Funny thing is that even if you create side-projects it&#x27;s unlikely that you&#x27;ll actually want to make them public. For example, say you want to create a Saas or bootstrap a small startup. The idea of putting all of your execution online for all to see (or borrow) is super scary.<p>For me it&#x27;s about potential upside. If I take time off work to work on my own projects and I expend 10 hours a day in creating them, am I doing this in order to lock down a better job in a couple of months, or am I doing this because I would like to some day have personally crafted something which creates value for others and allows me to live freely?<p>I think you&#x27;d have to be crazy to want to put huge projects online for all to see (particularly as they can often require stigmatising relaxation of processes which don&#x27;t make as much sense as an individual in order to be able to handle the workload as a sole engineer.)<p>Of course there are those that like to build development tools and libraries for other engineers. That&#x27;s a priesthood I&#x27;ve not really entered properly - it&#x27;s hard to create something which isn&#x27;t just yet another me-too framework, but very respectable if you are able to do this (top ~1%).",1417618785
8694020,comment,8693954,8693954,0,0,atwebb,,,"If I glossed over that correctly, it seems more like a &quot;Bank tax rule tightening&quot;, they estimate 5B over 5 years, 4 of which come from changing/tightening banking regulations and 1B (over 5 years) of which comes from mutlinationals operating in the UK. Not sure if that&#x27;s ~200M a year or if there&#x27;s some front/back loading and I really have no clue as to UK revenue/profits for all multinationals combined but (fuzzy math) is 200M a year for all of them a significant change?

In EU, the power is split between the governments and the banks, so, enterprises from other sectors has not very much influence on decision-making at this level as they have in the US.

8693998,comment,8691340,8693931,0,0,ghaff,,,"I tend to agree that a lot of the hate on resumes seems to be missing the point. Sure, if I know or know of someone, maybe a resume doesn&#x27;t add a whole lot. But they provide:
- A first pass at there being some match between experience/background and those needed for the position. 
- Some guidance for the interview process. Frankly, a lot of the details on the resume don&#x27;t really matter all that much to me but, overall, it usually gives me a sense of which avenues are worth probing in more detail and which ones I can skip over fairly quickly. Sure, I could draw a lot of this out during the interview but it&#x27;s easier to read over a couple of pages in advance and spend a few minutes thinking about how to spend the interview slot.",1417618537

8693994,comment,8689231,8693791,0,0,retrogradeorbit,,,"Yes. I completely agree. From my perspective, even if one person in a hundred can hear a difference, then I&#x27;m going to pay attention. I don&#x27;t want to boil everything down to meet the average. I think it&#x27;s fine to release 16/44. I think well produced music sounds excellent in that format. It&#x27;s one of the reasons the CD has done so well. It&#x27;s just hifi enough to capture everything. And it&#x27;s amazing to think this technology had its début in 1982!<p>But for so long, for those of us who want a higher quality (hearing it exactly as they would have heard in the studio during the production) there was nothing we could do. Willing to pay more for it, doesn&#x27;t matter. You just can&#x27;t get it. It&#x27;s still that way.<p>What gripes me is the attitude of many, including this xiph article, that hires versions &quot;make no sense&quot;, that &quot;there is no point&quot; and thus everyone should just be happy with what they&#x27;ve got and that anyone protesting is an &quot;audiophool&quot; or believes in magic fairies or something. We all get lumped in with those people buying $3000 IEC power cables. For many people it&#x27;s all black and white, there is no room for grey. You either think that 128kbps mp3s sound identical to the analogue master tape, or you are a fool spending $20,000 on magical stickers to increase the light speed in your CD player.<p>All I want is to be able to buy the mix and hear it as the engineer heard it in the studio. That would be nice. I know it&#x27;s not for everyone, but it doesn&#x27;t make me crazy.<p>As food for thought, have a read of what Rupert Neve said about Geoff Emerick&#x27;s hearing ability (being able to discern a 3dB rise at 54kHz) here: <a href=""http://poonshead.com/Reading/Articles.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">http://poonshead.com/Reading/Articles.aspx</a><p>&quot;The danger here is that the more qualified you are, the more you &#x27;know&#x27; that something can&#x27;t be true, so you don&#x27;t believe it.

I suppose some of the political ones didn&#x27;t do so well, and those are the ones that I think may have gotten an equal number of up and down votes (topics like copyright infringement, private vs. public healthcare, etc).<p>So I guess I&#x27;m mostly just trying to throw out an idea here.  I understand if you don&#x27;t want to encourage political comments, but in the end, it seems that anything people are passionate about devolves into politics.  For a specific example, I&#x27;ve noticed some very heated posts regarding things like imperative vs. functional programming that are practically as ideological as libertarianism vs. progressivism.  It&#x27;s kind of like, both sides have merit, I don&#x27;t think there will ever be compromise, but I&#x27;m hoping to find a &quot;third path&quot;.  It&#x27;s an incredible hard problem to solve though, so if the current scoring system is working, great, don&#x27;t fix it if it&#x27;s not broken.<p>To get to the gist of it, I think what I am requesting is that the scoring somehow distinguish between posts that receive no points and ones that receive a lot of activity but settle on the same points.

It&#x27;s possible to amplify quiet sounds until you can hear the quantization noise, but it&#x27;s also possible to turn the volume down until you can&#x27;t hear the noise. And at that point, there is plenty of dynamic range in 16 bits to take you all the way to the threshold of pain, so you&#x27;re not losing out on the high end either. Of course it&#x27;s possible that the recording was made very quiet, so you have to crank it up to listen to it. But that&#x27;s a problem with the mastering, not an inherent limitation of the 16-bit format.",1417618005

8693878,comment,8692584,8693659,0,0,waps,,,"This is the strongest argument against democracy I&#x27;ve ever heard. When it comes right down to it, fact is that >50% (and more likely >80%) is in favor of laws against LGBT. At least 50% of the 7 billion humans is in favor of criminalizing freedom of religion. In favor of censorship is probably >75% as well, because when push comes to shove, a large majority of muslims, chinese and russians are in favor of it, as is most of Africa.<p>The problem I do see is that the &quot;other side&quot;, specifically the UN, is not really any better. Freedom of religion is constantly under attack in the general assembly, and so is freedom of speech.<p>Take for example <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defamation_of_religion_and_the_United_Nations"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defamation_of_religion_and_the_...</a> (TLDR: attempts to introduce blasphemy laws world-wide supported by the UN) ... details a constant campaign against freedom of religion that&#x27;s entering it&#x27;s third decade now of majority support in the general assembly. And this is but one of many examples. This makes it clear that defending human rights using either the UN of the ICC is like asking Putin to solve Ukraine&#x27;s internal government crises. Whatever the solution is to guarantee freedom, it&#x27;s not the UN.<p>Sad part is, if anything, these groups are growing, not shrinking.<p>I know it doesn&#x27;t look like it in the middle of the US, but you should remember that the US is barely 350 million people. The number of people that would like their country to attack the US today, no matter how stupid an act it would be, world wide, is bigger than that. The number of people that would like to see the US taken down several notches even includes >50% of Europeans, so you can imagine what it is in the rest of the world (talk about a moronic position : China will replace the US should that happen, and it is blatantly obvious that will not be an improvement, not even for Chinese, although most Chinese I&#x27;ve talked to argue otherwise). In most places it doesn&#x27;t even have anything to do with the US, other than that the US culture is leaking into their countries perhaps. In Europe, it&#x27;s mostly political jealousy, the US has all this power, and is not using it &quot;for good&quot; (good can mean climate change, economic stuff, various wars, and now that 10% of europe or so is muslims &quot;because it is destroying islam&quot;, not that you can ever get a straight answer of what that means, though references to Gaza seem common). It&#x27;s not exclusively the US either. India seems to be as hated as the US sometimes, except for in Europe. And this is ignoring the wild cards, like how >30% of Europe constantly votes for the extreme right, more than that even in some countries (and less in Germany, but it&#x27;s being repressed, so there&#x27;s no real data on the actual number). Japan is re-arming at a speed that if you told me 5 years ago that might happen I would have laughed).<p>Russia is but one example of a nation that seems to be regressing to the situation before WWI. Turkey is similar. As we know, most of the middle east and northern Africa sees a return to the pseudo-roman-empire caliphate of the 7th century as a solution. China pretty much is an empire, including conquered colonies, and however dictatorial the current government is, from talking to Chinese people here I believe it would actually win an election, should there be one. All want an empire, and of course their own empire to win.<p>None of these attitudes seem rational to me, as people are worse and worse off, yet that only seems to fan the flames. All of these empires are calling for war, to some extent. I fear that as time goes on, the amount of sparks needed to light the powder kegs seems to be going down, and I feel really queasy about how little energy it took to start the ISIS war in the middle east, for example. How much sparks would it take to start something similar in Europe ? (yes there&#x27;s less muslims there, but it&#x27;s not like ISIS has even 10% support in Iraq)",1417617292

Probably more often, in fact.<p>In the example given it wouldn&#x27;t be so bad, but you&#x27;d only get an approximate indication of where the error occurred rather than a specific line/character. So of course, whatever is reporting the error would now need to understand and handle the much more complex scenario of &quot;fuzzy&quot; location information instead of a simple unique index to a specific character. Depending on what it then needs to do with that information, the complexity could spiral from there.<p>If you want to just have things work no matter what, you have no choice but to use bignums. I was wondering about this recently, so did some benchmarks in Clojure. The performance was horrible, so frankly this is still not a viable alternative. Maybe in 10 years time, if every CPU has a bignum coprocessor by then.<p>Also, there are times, particularly in low-level graphics programming or cryptography, where you actually <i>want</i> integer modulo arithmetic, or to be able to do bitwise booleans predictably. In those cases, JavaScript-style loose typing can be a huge pain.<p>BTW, I&#x27;ve been a big advocate of JavaScript for about as long as Doug Crockford, so my point isn&#x27;t that JavaScript-style type handling is bad: just that it&#x27;s very far from a silver bullet.",1417616942

As such, one of the (unstated) assumptions is that the reader is already motivated to learn about programming with dependent types.<p>The early examples you see with inductive structures such as Nat are about learning the foundations, and you can&#x27;t go on to do anything especially interesting without a solid understanding of the foundations. Its structure often also turns out to have a convenient correspondence with more realistic data structures, such as lists (their length) and trees (their depth).<p>I do sometimes wonder if we should start using something more obviously useful as an introductory example though. There&#x27;s plenty of possibilities, and programmers aren&#x27;t generally going to be using Nats in practice (I rarely do).<p>I don&#x27;t use Agda myself (I use Idris, which is similar but is more directly aimed at general purpose programming) but I do know that it has primitive types...<p>Anyway, there&#x27;s all kinds of interesting work going on at the minute which goes way beyond these introductory examples. For example, we&#x27;re working on a way of specifying and verifying implementations of communication protocols (<a href=""https://github.com/edwinb/Protocols"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/edwinb/Protocols</a>), which we&#x27;d like to apply to cryptographic protocols when we&#x27;ve made some more progress.

From a scientific standpoint, this means vinyl has worse fidelity than digital audio. But some people like the distortion, as it makes music sound &quot;warmer.&quot;<p>2. In the mid 90s, audio engineers began mastering music louder. In order to maximize the perceived loudness, they use an effect called dynamic compression, which reduces the dynamic range of the recording (the difference between louds and softs).

How does overhead work? How do you verify that the work is being done if there are no deliverables and a high failure rate? How much money can go to salary? etc). The two obvious problems I see with crowd funding science are lack of ROI and ignorant investors.<p>> People spend more than that on iPhones.<p>> Kickstarter is already crossing this threshold. It has already raised several billion and its only 5 years old and that number is growing exponentially.<p>People get ROI at Kickstarter in the form of products. People get ROI in the form of utility from buying Apple products. There is no obvious route to ROI from crowdfunding science. Perhaps a system can be devised where investors are invited to take part in some of the work or can track the progress and get regular briefs, but this would be enormously distracting to the investigators. Maybe I&#x27;m just cold hearted, but I simply don&#x27;t see people giving away billions of dollars per year to fund science (I would love to be proven wrong though!)<p>The second potential issue with crowd funding science is the difficulty in evaluating the merit of proposed projects. The general public (and most of the scientific community) is not qualified to evaluate the legitimacy or impact of highly domain specific projects. How do people decide what is a good project vs a bad project within a discipline? How do people evaluate projects across disciplines? Sexy translational projects involving novel therapeurics / device development may be easily pitched, but who is going to invest in boring basic science in a zebra fish model? What happens when groups come in to take advantage of this ignorance and pitch bullshit projects and then walk away with the money? This situation also dissuades people from funding young investigators. If people don&#x27;t understand the projects, they&#x27;re likely to fund people with established track records and titles because that seems safer, not new people.<p>As I have espoused in previous threads involving the academic science model, one way to solve our current funding problem and the problem of title requirements may be to augment the academic science model with for profit (or not for profit) institutes. I would envision such institutes immediately granting PhD or post-doc level investigators PI status so that they could apply for all grants, and allowing BS level scientists to do research without having to go through PhD programs. Such institutes might also uncap investigator salaries so that investigators could be paid fairly, and would allow investigators to own their IP. These places could also charge significantly less overhead than universities as they don&#x27;t need to fund non-science related endeavors. Perhaps crowd funding could be used to establish or augment such institutes, which could then bring in established investigators to oversee how money raised is distributed.<p>Another solution to the funding and title problems is simply to increase government funding, but tie in rules which stipulate that universities much raise the number of faculty spots or add restricted faculty spots for very junior investigators.<p>These seem like plausible solutions, but the idea of a crowd funded marketplace for science seems frankly dubious.",1417615340

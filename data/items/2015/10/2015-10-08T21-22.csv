There are two reasons why this is important:<p>1. Some people want to exhibit support but don&#x27;t know what to say, so they&#x27;re not comfortable commenting. On more positive stories, they&#x27;ll just hit &quot;Like&quot;, but that would feel inappropriate to do on a more negative story, so they don&#x27;t do anything even though they want to express their support.<p>2. Facebook&#x27;s News Feed algorithm uses Likes to determine how articles are sorted in your News Feed. If people don&#x27;t Like important stories because they feel the word &quot;Like&quot; is inappropriate, then those stories will be downranked because the algorithm doesn&#x27;t know the stories are supposed to be important.<p>Reactions solve both by allowing people to both wordlessly express sympathy for and signal-boost stories that they feel would be inappropriate to &quot;Like&quot;.",1444341339

I have never had a negative experience with a State Trooper.<p>One time, I was speeding and got a ticket for it but the cop was really cool about it. I was in Cadiz county Ohio and I was doing 75MPH. I was in a 65 zone and then it dropped to 55 and I failed to notice the sign. A cop clocked me doing 75 and started following me. He waiting until two miles later to pull me over where the speed limit was back at 65MPH. He was very professional about the whole thing and I have no complaints about him.<p>Unfortunately, not every interaction goes well.<p>I know that I have these and I suspect that you do too.
Little verbal clues that I drop to indicate to the officer that I know what&#x27;s going on but I&#x27;m not going to say it overtly and give him a reason to pretend to be offended at the suggestion.<p>A few examples:
When a cop asks &quot;Do you know why I pulled you over?&quot;, I say &quot;I have a pretty good idea, officer but I am not going to say it out loud.&quot;<p>&quot;Where are you headed?&quot; gets met with &quot;I&#x27;m on my way to obey the law, officer.&quot;<p>They also like to ask &quot;Do you have any drugs in the car?&quot; and my response is always &quot;No more than you do, officer.&quot;<p>When asked for my license, &quot;I need to reach into my right front pocket to retrieve my wallet, officer.&quot; and I wait until he indicates that I should reach for it.<p>I have found these to be responses that deescalate the situation.<p>They&#x27;re not direct challenges to his authority so he doesn&#x27;t feel threatened and they allow me to get through the interaction with my sense of dignity intact.

Where is the deceit?<p>Do you feel you would owe people the freedom to use your property free-of-charge? What about the mortgage payments you endure? The maintenance/upkeep (roofs, siding, carpet, plumbing, electrical, all amortized over the life of the building)? Should this be a loss you take in order to let someone else sleep in your house?<p>Disclosure of bias: In Seattle where I live, the cost of real estate is higher than the prevailing rents, when you factor mortgage payments, maintenance, utilities, HOA, etc. This makes it a little easier for me to see the equity in pricing between rentals and owned homes.

Many of these students come from countries where getting a tourist visa is hard. Even getting a H1B is hard too: look at the lottery ticket issue.<p>2. UK does not permit non-EU foreigners to work after finishing studies. So, it is irrational for those who borrow money to study to UK, then find work to pay off the debts.<p>3. USA gives 12 months OPT EAD permit after finishing their studies. If it is STEM masters, this OPT can be extended for 17 months. So, solid 29 months afte finishing 2 years masters. Given how hard is it to win the H1 lottery, it is a good choice.<p>4. There is 20,000 H1 quota every year for US STEM graduates.<p>5. It is very hard for many of these Masters students in US to get a decent paying job in their home countries. That&#x27;s why, in India, etc., F1 visa is seen as a ticket to good living abroad.<p>American citizens/perm residents are equally rational as foreigners above. Their reasons are:<p>A. You don&#x27;t need a masters degree to pursue PhD in the states. This is not the case in India and in many common wealth countries: you need to have masters to pursue Ph.D.<p>B. There is a chance that many students want to give up on Ph.D in the middle of their studies. So, they can use whatever credits they got to get Masters degree and drop out of the Ph.D program. This is the case when one passes Ph.D quals or not.<p>C. Some pursue masters to broaden their interest. Imagine someone with BA in Maths is interested in psychology, but don&#x27;t want to pursue Ph.D. He just want to broaden his understanding. He will go for MS in Psychology.<p>D. For few, it could be moving from no-name school BA to MS in Finance at an Ivy League. HYP are in differnet category of Ivies from the rest.<p>E.

What&#x27;s important to this conversation is that drawing from the the group ∪{N(x), ∀x} will unquestionably give you the best bridge designs and limiting yourself to some N(i) will tend to give you a worse subset of designs.<p>That is the entire point of my statement. The initial problem you are attempting to address is willful ignorance based on arbitrary groups. Recreating theses groups in an attempt to &#x27;even out the playing field&#x27; makes no sense.<p>> Think what you like, you are simply wrong here as a historical fact and basic logic. The most obvious counterexamples are productive people who, due to discrimination, had their careers ended (e.g. Alan Turing, Jewish scientists killed in the holocaust) but it should be equally obvious that after given access, people from previously excluded groups had valuable contributions that would otherwise have taken longer to discover. I can&#x27;t believe I have to spell this out...<p>And yet Alan Turing had a successful carrier helping the British government, Albert Einstein is heralded as one of the forefathers of modern day physics, and Hooper is considered to be the grandmother of CS.<p>> You can keep writing that word salad as much as you like, it&#x27;s not true. The fact is good bridge builders from [unprivileged group] were being excluded. Despite your fantasies to the contrary, you were not living in a meritocracy where [privleged group] earned all the bridge contracts. You were living in a degenerate system where [group 1] rigged the system so that [group 2] and [group 3] were unable to win contracts even if their bridges were better.<p>I&#x27;d pay to see proof of this. Please if you would present some information to contradict my statement. You have, up to this point, only used conjecture. I have presented (at this point) six different people who have succeeded from minority groups you say need help.<p>> Lol, a ridiculous standard you pulled out of thin air. Discrimination exists, is widespread and has substantial negative effects on our society. Those are real facts that matter.<p>Well if it is so prevalent surely you would not have a difficult time providing factual evidence of it? Wouldn&#x27;t it be easy for you to comply with my request?<p>I do agree that there is discrimination, but the evidence I have seen to date has pointed to the fact that people who have determination and the mind to back up their statements always win.",1444340250

My comment came off emotional; I&#x27;m not sorry for that, but I think my stance came across weakly.<p>I&#x27;m not saying there aren&#x27;t very real issues that need to be addressed with manipulating human genetics. I&#x27;ve seen GATTACA too ;). The issues I had with the article (which I&#x27;ve since skimmed) are this (try to read it in a friendly tone...I&#x27;m emotionally invested in this, but I&#x27;m not irritated):<p>* The term &quot;Eugenics&quot; may be correct in this situation, but it&#x27;s historically loaded with extremely negative baggage. It felt like click bait.<p>* Comparing disease removal by genetic manipulation to optional enhancements by genetic manipulation is unhelpful. One allows for the other, but that doesn&#x27;t mean we must allow them as a pair.<p>* The wealth gap for this treatment is going to be no different from the wealth gap in any other new, expensive treatment we currently use. Poor people will still have less access to any expensive treatment, this isn&#x27;t going to be different in any way. It&#x27;s a problem, yes, but it&#x27;s not specific to Genetic manipulation, it&#x27;s specific to medicine.<p>* Our ability to screen people for genetic defects and decide if we want or don&#x27;t want children is already excellent; I know I&#x27;m a carrier for Batten disease, my brother&#x27;s killer. Had my wife also been a carrier I just wouldn&#x27;t have had biological children. That&#x27;s not Eugenics, that&#x27;s sanity. Abortion of diseased embryos is a far more complex, but orthogonal moral issue which we&#x27;ve already been dealing with for a long time.<p>* Our legal system limits this sort of experimentation and it&#x27;s terribly slow to change. Even autonomous cars, which are safer and less accident prone than humans, are going to take a long while to get approved. Saying we&#x27;re on a slippery slope ignores how much regulation there is over this. I&#x27;d even argue what we&#x27;re dealing with is a slippery slope uphill.

Keep in mind that the only ticket I’ve ever gotten was for 42 MPH in a 35 MPH Zone, and the cop lied, I was doing 37 MPH. Also, the cop kept me there an hour while he run my license and repeatedly asked me questions from his car over a bullhorn (‘what do you do’ etc) to humiliate me.<p>DWB in Boston Metro area was a frequent occurence for me until a blockbuster Boston Globe/Northeastern University study in 2003 showed how prevalent it was and forcing change. The funny thing, Boston Globe profiled one cop over 2 months and showed how he tended to give white drivers warnings but gave black drivers tickets for lesser infractions, and his excuse was essentially that ‘blacks gave him attitude’.<p><a href=""http://www.boston.com/globe/metro/packages/tickets/010603.shtml"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.boston.com/globe/metro/packages/tickets/010603.sh...</a><p><i>An officer&#x27;s pattern in two months might not reflect a career&#x27;s work. But one patrolman&#x27;s decisions shed some light on how gaps in ticketing can emerge.<p>At his speed trap on VFW Parkway in West Roxbury on Monday, April 2, 2001, Officer William G. Knecht wasn&#x27;t guessing the speeds of cars headed toward him. He had the newest instrument for clocking motorists, a LIDAR gun. But his day was filled with moments of leniency and of toughness.<p>At 9:30 a.m., Knecht wrote a $115 ticket to a 35-year-old black woman from Boston, for going 14 m.p.h. over in a 35 zone. Five minutes later, the officer clocked at the same speed an 80-year-old white man from Medfield, and gave him a written warning.<p>The next day, Tuesday, back on the VFW Parkway, Knecht warned a 33-year-old white woman from Boston at 9:25 a.m., after he clocked her driving 16 m.p.h. over in a 35 m.p.h. zone.<p>Exactly 25 minutes later, Knecht ticketed a 28-year-old black man, also from Boston, though he was driving slower -- 15 m.p.h. over in the 35 m.p.h. zone.<p>In the two months studied, Knecht wrote 105 citations. He ticketed 84 percent of the minority speeders, and 72 percent of the whites. He ticketed men and women equally. And the older the driver, the more leniency Knecht showed, especially if the older driver was white.<p>...<p>&quot;There are always mitigating circumstances in a stop,&quot; Knecht said in an interview. &quot;Anything could be said or could happen. Attitudes, people talking back to you. The circumstances change with each individual driver. But for most cops I know, race has nothing to do with it.”</i><p>So in order to buy Officer Knecht assumptions we have to assume that every black person he stopped gave him attitude (which any black person with any sense of self-preservation would not be likely to do).<p>We also had a disconcerting incident in Brookline MA (2004). My wife (fiancee at the time), who is white lived there, and we were once walking hand in hand. A cop car drove by, and then pulled a sharp tire screeching U-turn and came right up to us, almost onto the sidewalk. The white cop looks at my wife and asks ‘Are you OK?’. She says yes, and the cop fixes me with a glare that could have killed, and then roared off in disgust. We were gob-smacked, but not really surprised.<p>Not all my cop interactions have been bad (I was rear ended on Wellington Circle in Everett and the MA State Trooper who responded and sorted out everything was incredibly efficient and polite), but that has been the exception. When dealing with cops, I know that anything I do/say (or even the initial stop) is colored by race. What would be simple assertiveness from someone white of my same socioeconomic status would be seen as being uncooperative/suspicious coming from me. As a black person, I cannot operate under the mistaken assumption that the cops are actually there for my safety/benefit.",1444339831

From the article:<p><i>We at CloudFlare make sure that our servers run at top notch performance, so our customers&#x27; websites do as well!.</i><p>Correct me if I&#x27;m wrong, but it does seem to me that this is of greater value to CloudFlare in terms of electricity savings than to CloudFlare&#x27;s customers. Less computing time for CloudFlare at the expense of larger output files for CloudFlare&#x27;s customers to serve, files which will potentially be served again and again and count against the customer&#x27;s transfer quota. It might not seem like much, but it adds up when you consider how many times a single image in the wild can be downloaded. Consider the following example:<p><pre><code>  # Original size is 21796912 bytes
  # jpegtran with SIMD
  jpegtran -copy none -optimize -progressive bigjpeg.jpg > bigjpeg_jpegtran.jpg
  # bigjpeg_jpegtran.jpg resulting size is 19771224 bytes

  # mozjpeg 3.1
  mozjpeg -copy none -optimize -progressive bigjpeg.jpg > bigjpeg_mozjpeg.jpg
  # bigjpeg_mozjpeg.jpg size is 19328832 bytes
</code></pre>
That&#x27;s a difference of 442KB! I&#x27;m not emphasizing the computing time here. I do not dispute that this is orders of magnitude faster than Mozjpeg, but isn&#x27;t it worth doing the extra work to get a smaller file? That file could be served billions of times. My argument is simply that the extra computing effort in the beginning leads to much grander savings in the long run.<p>In my (quick) testing Jpegtran&#x27;s <i>squishing</i> performance is consistently less than that of Mozjpeg.

Their policies often state up front that there is no expectation of privacy, that staff can check up on your activities if they have reason to do so. I have not paid much attention to policies at, say, Starbucks, but I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if they have similar policies. Furthermore, my understanding is that Wi-Fi has pretty big security holes compared to a landline. Plus, if you are a regular, people will recognize you.<p>I gave up driving years ago and I walk everywhere. This is bizarre and noteworthy behavior in the U.S. People stop me and talk to me and say &quot;I see you walking All The Time...&quot; The degree to which people in cars notice me, recognize me and feel not only free but compelled to speak to me is downright creepy.<p>So I will suggest that if you spend time very regularly in cafe&#x27;s using their Wi-Fi, etc. people will not only recognize you, they will feel friendly and curious and like they have some goddamn right to grill you about your life and why you are there all the time and so on and so forth.<p>I also agree with AnimalMuppet that the lengths to which you are willing to go in order to be &quot;completely anonymous&quot; raise enough red flags that someone, at some point, will take an interest in tracking your ass down and that &quot;someone&quot; may very well be a government agency. So while I get annoyed at how humans are wired and how they conclude they have some goddamn right to grill me merely because they fucking recognize me when I have no clue whatsoever who they are, beyond being annoyed as hell at the whole thing, I don&#x27;t really need to worry too much because walking everywhere isn&#x27;t actually a crime, no matter how bizarre and eyebrow-raising it is. But I cannot imagine any reason to go to the lengths you want to go that don&#x27;t involve serious crimes and most other people will be far more critical of your motives than I am. I am pretty live-and-let-live. On average, other people are much more judgey, butt-in-sky and controlling than I am. So you can bet dollars to donuts that most people will assume you are up to something incredibly evil and that suspicion will fuel their interest in grilling you, tracking you down, etc.",1444339200

And we saw the consequences of that.<p>I&#x27;ve always been fascinated by the impact of various drug-containing plants on humanity and it&#x27;s history.
Plants, because most drugs are extracted or synthesised from them.<p>Shamans say that it is the &#x27;essence&#x27; or &#x27;spirit&#x27; of the plant that is psychoactive - you&#x27;re &#x27;inviting&#x27; another &#x27;being&#x27; into your consciousness.<p>Those who smoked pot have probably noticed the alternative or alien &#x27;voice&#x27; which appears in your head and makes you think and say funny things or think paranoid thoughts.
This happens with all drugs - the drug (or, in shamanic terms - the spirit of the plant) becomes one&#x27;s invisible councillor - an interlocutor in the user&#x27;s internal dialogue.<p>Take tobacco - the act of smoking a cigarette is an act of &#x27;conversing&#x27; with the plant, an act of thinking and taking decisions. 
Notice the impact that tobacco has had on the development of the human race - it&#x27;s impossible to claim that it was responsible for all our progress, but somehow it was present in the pipes of Einstein and Oppenheimer and in the cigars smoked after a successful space mission.<p>It was also present in the trenches of wars.<p>Today our world is more drugged than it has ever been. Besides all the classes of illegal drugs, we also have people eating tens of thousands of various synthetic chemicals - prescription drugs - and of course making all sorts of combinations between them.<p>What will the consequence of this chemical experimentation end up being ?<p>Time will tell. Clearly we&#x27;re doing some radical changes to how our minds and bodies work and this has a direct impact on how our society looks and behaves and what decisions are being made.",1444338857

But, where remedies within a political system exist, then the system can&#x27;t be assumed to be tyrannical.<p>An equivalence drawn between the US and other governments would seem to suggest that civilian gun ownership doesn&#x27;t deter the violence and corruption of the state, nor does its absence elsewhere appear to have led to the inevitable slaughter of those populations for whom gun control is much more strict than in the US.<p>Rather, it seems that when one enshrines into the culture the precept that the only free state is one cultivated by popular violence, it gives both the state and the people an excuse to justify violence as being an unavoidable cost of civilization.

All notifications go to Slack. There&#x27;s no need for per-project settings because it&#x27;s all just one room. At some point we will probably want some projects to go to other rooms, but that&#x27;s a coarse-grained exception, not something that warrants a per-project setting.<p>Also, if you need per-person notification settings, then surely that&#x27;s part of the user&#x27;s account/profile, not the project. That would be just a single dashboard page with (say) on/off sliders for each project.<p>In my mind, the data model used by exception trackers (including, it seems, Sentry) is wrong. There needs to be just one stream of events, tagged by things like application name that you can filter on. How those events map to things like notifications and aggregations and rules and source files and teams and so on is completely orthogonal to the stream. Those things then apply to a subset that you can modify dynamically without having to reconfigure the sender.",1444338462

I don&#x27;t think this is so clear.

It&#x27;s never been easier to participate in myriad ways -- the cost is epsilon. But if people see the benefits as zero, which many seem to, they still won&#x27;t engage.

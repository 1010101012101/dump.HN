With the lessons of the past in mind and HTML5 still not being widely deployed, yeah, I'd say stand your ground. And from that angle I'd say it's more similar to ActiveX than Flash.<p>It's semantics. But I think it was a non-bad decision to include it in the default installation procedure.<p>(edit: Actually, reading back, one might say that I don't agree with you! :)",1264388322

1074270,comment,1074136,1074136,0,0,TrevorBurnham,,,"Definitely Scala. I've worked with Groovy/Grails, which is nice in a lot of ways (mainly ways that are borrowed from Ruby/Rails), but I think the language is hindered by being overly Java-compatible. That makes it easy to learn, but limits the language's capabilities. I'd be very happy if some of the syntactic sugar of Groovy were simply made a part of the Java language (e.g. default scope is getter/setter, lists and maps have their own syntax); that would cut down on the ridiculous amount of Java boilerplate. I'm not as big a fan of the dynamic aspects of Groovy, which can make debugging painful. In Grails, if something goes wrong, it's not uncommon to see a 30-line stacktrace that gives you no clue as to where the error actually occurred, because the error-prone code was added dynamically.<p>As to Scala: It's extremely elegant, and the community has its act together as far as positioning the language to go mainstream. I'm expecting the 2.8.0 release to be a major step forward, thanks in part to a completely rewritten Eclipse plugin. That kind of tool support will be crucial in getting the language to critical mass. One thing that worries me, though, is that Scala projects tend to be built using Maven, which is awfully complex. Perhaps something like JavaGems may prove to be more important to the future JVM ecosystem than any single language.",1264387678

Whether or not I do that as a corporation shouldn't factor into it.<p>Let's assume five of us play poker every Tuesday night and we're all plumbers. A new candidate is running for office that wants to license plumbers, which we're against. So we pool our poker earnings and start running some radio spots calling his mother a fat alcoholic. So far pretty standard political fare.<p>But if we were a corporation of plumbers, suddenly the rules change.<p>Or another example. Let's say I'm General Motors and I don't like Candidate X. So I just tell MSNBC to run negative stories about him right up until election day. No harm no foul. But if I'm Ford?

Everyone installs it this way, and it actually supports way more codecs than the official Chrome (Google didn't buy licenses for MPEG2, Xvid, etc.).",1264385030

Ever.)  Mahalo used to have in-house editors before they moved to mostly outsourced ""editors"" before they realized editors cost a lot of money and firing them didn't decrease revenues in the slightest.  At the moment their editorial staff is a thin pretense maintained to keep the site from getting bounced out of the index.<p>Disclaimer: As with most other massive content plays which have large audiences of unsophisticated Internet users, I indirectly subsidize Mahalo through AdSense expenditures.  To the tune of probably over a hundred bucks last year, but I don't have my numbers in front of me.  Like I mentioned in my blog post earlier today, they send great traffic (i.e. it is cheap and converts well) because my ads <i>are</i> the content on their pages.<p>That is disquieting to me in some ways.  I could ban them and start chopping off heads from the Demand Media hydra in my AdSense account, but that would consume vast amounts of my time and just cost me money.",1264384909

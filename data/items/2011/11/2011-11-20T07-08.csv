How does an author go from writing to generating books without encountering specialized (and expensive) typesetters?<p>The first piece of advice that self-published Kindle authors will give you is to have a beautiful cover - how do you design one and integrate it into your ebook generation workflow to get one nice little package ?
Can I say that the publishers are fleecing us, when probably they are having to pay extra to make sure their ebooks look good on Kindle, Nook, Sony, etc. ?<p>The toolchain doesnt exist - and it is time for disruption.",1321775957

Security is about trade-offs. I am indeed concerned about HTML and do most browsing in a VM. But to me WebGL is farther out on the risk/benefit spectrum than HTML. I would not accept it for ads or ordinary page content. I would consider enabling it selectively for an app that I carefully decided to trust.<p>* Admittedly I have not tried, but I suspect it's going to be very difficult to get it to work well from within a VM.<p>* HTML parsers and renderers have indeed had plenty of vulnerabilities. They have taken years to get as secure as they are today and we may not have seen the last of the exploitable bugs in them.<p>* HTML parsers have been implemented from the beginning to accept untrusted data from the internet. 3D graphics drivers, on the other hand, are designed primarily for performance in a scenario where they are run by a single-user game on the local machine, often with Admin privs already.<p>* We saw how many years it took Microsoft (the company that could reportedly turn on a dime) to 'get' security to the point that they could ship a secure browser. I don't see much evidence that graphics vendors are even thinking about it yet.<p>* Apple knows that WebGL bugs will result in jailbroken iPhones. Guess how many years their OpenGL support level is behind the PC...on the very same GPU hardware? Last I checked, someone reported getting OpenGL 3.2 working on a Mac. I've had usable OpenGL 3.3 on a freaking Linux laptop for a couple of years now. More powerful GPUs are up at 4.2.<p>* A buffer overflow in HTML does not automatically amount to a kernel level compromise, (some recent font handling bugs in Windows notwithstanding :-). In fact, the latest generation of sandboxed browsers are building defense in depth mitigations. Any buffer mismanagement between the GPU, driver, GL, and WebGL seems very likely to result in complete pwnage. The GPU can access host memory directly with no access permissions.<p>Don't get me wrong - I love the <i>idea</i> of WebGL and want it to succeed. I just would hate to see it end up like Flash, struggling for years to retrofit security onto something that wasn't originally spec'd for it and a bunch of its users getting pwned in the process.",1321773477

Most delay loading a web page is caused by latency. Latency in the three way handshake to establish TCP connections and latency for each additional HTTP request even with keepalive enabled. Payload is not as big an issue because it needs fast throughput, not fast round-trip times which are impossible to achieve if you're far away from the server.<p>Smaller and faster are always good and always worth striving for (in coding). So I don't want to take away from this, especially since it means more eyes on jQuery. I think it's great work. But keep in mind that the speed increase is not going to be enormous and the cost is running a non-standard jQuery that lacks .css(), .ajax() and $(function()).",1321772692

In my own n = 1 study, I struggled through dual 2 back initially, but with a few weeks of practice, I gradually was able to climb up to the dual 4 back level, and stopped there out of sheer laziness.<p>Anyways, for anyone interested in N-Back games, check out the Brain Workshop software and website.<p><a href=""http://brainworkshop.sourceforge.net/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://brainworkshop.sourceforge.net/</a>",1321772675

If you're a regular here, you're less likely than the average programmer to have done that, and it's probably not really the code you want to talk about if you have. Java isn't especially popular for personal projects, startups or most other things people want to talk about or show off here.<p>Given some combination of first-class functions, various metaprogramming capabilities, dynamic typing and paradigms other than class-based OO, many of these patters disappear.",1321772574

My 'birth' editor was FINE (Fine Is Not Emacs) which was based on Finseth's thesis but wasn't as computationally heavy as Emacs on the DEC10. On CP/M I used Mince (Mince is not completely EMACS) and later Microemacs. When I got to Sun I learned vi. Left Sun, forced to use Windows and that was where VSE became my goto editor of choice. Then Netapp, mostly windows, some not, used VSE and vi. Then Google and used vim almost exclusively because it was the 'same' on my macbook and my workstation. Once I got a good port of VIM for windows I could have the same environment everywhere.",1321772571

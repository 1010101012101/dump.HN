It is your standard zerohedge analysis that fed is printing money and it is causing a tech bubble. Can anyone track and connect the dots from fed bond buying to increase in Facebook share price? I don’t think anyone knows.<p>2.	His comments on facebook are much more fascinating though. One thing I did not understand is where all the mobile money on facebook is coming from. Looks like it is from app installs (don’t think FB breaks it out) which in turn is created by VC funding bubble. The VC&#x27;s fund because they see mobile on Facebook is taking off. Close the loop, classic bubble. So the whole scheme is likely to end pretty badly for facebook (sounds plausible). PG talked about the dot com bubble and the impact of VC funded ad buying that led to increasing market cap for yahoo until it burst<p>“By 1998, Yahoo was the beneficiary of a de facto Ponzi scheme. Investors were excited about the Internet. One reason they were excited was Yahoo&#x27;s revenue growth. So they invested in new Internet startups. The startups then used the money to buy ads on Yahoo to get traffic. Which caused yet more revenue growth for Yahoo, and further convinced investors the Internet was worth investing in. When I realized this one day, sitting in my cubicle, I jumped up like Archimedes in his bathtub, except instead of &quot;Eureka!&quot; I was shouting &quot;Sell!&quot;”<p><a href=""http://www.paulgraham.com/yahoo.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.paulgraham.com/yahoo.html</a><p>Edit: I should have guessed, people are more interested in supplying ready made narratives from the past five years for point 1 (which is not that interesting) than point 2. SMH. Some cool narratives are being provided which I heard almost verbatim at various points in the past five years that “explained” how --<p>1.	We will have world wide inflation of epic proportions (reality: world is fighting deflation all over)<p>2.	ECB is doing a great job compared to the fed continuing with QE2 in 2011 (reality: recession in Europe vs the US)<p>3.	Gold will soar through the roof (reality: slump)<p>4.	Oil prices will rise forerver (until they collapsed)<p>5.	House prices in China will go to sky (until they stopped doing)<p>6.	Apple was up 100% in late 2012 (until it collapsed by half six months later)<p>Etc etc. I would have thought some humility would have set in the “FED is printing, things are inflated to sky crowd”. Nope, just doubling down. Always stay with the narrative explain something else until we get it right ☺. At least I admit I don&#x27;t know how things work :-).<p>Consider, there are $20 Trillion dollars of SWF’s in the world investing all over. What is the impact of these as opposed to QE?",1418849783

8764243,comment,8732891,8760857,0,0,cbsmith,,,"I apologize. I reread my comments and they come off as downright incendiary which was not what I intended.<p>At least back when I was using it, there is a bit of a science to tuning mdbm correctly for your data. In general, it is a tool designed to allow you to tweak with whatever application level knowledge you have of your data&#x27;s structure, and as a consequence it can be terribly suboptimal out of the box. Depending on circumstances, even if you don&#x27;t need disk level transactional integrity, LMDB may indeed be a be better choice.<p>That said, the test case you are describing is definitely for a use case for which mdbm is suboptimal. The results you are getting are if anything surprisingly good under the circumstances, and frankly I&#x27;d have never even considered using mdbm for that kind of work load (LMDB would definitely be one of the first choices I&#x27;d consider for that kind of work load).<p>As you&#x27;ve mentioned, a hashtable based key-value store is fairly suboptimal for disk based storage (though depending on circumstnace and how you tweak it, a hash table with mdbm can work surprisingly well with an SSD based store), and the numbers you are presenting seem if anything better than I&#x27;d expect.<p>The reports you are seeing with XFS seem... odd, and almost feel like either a simple issue with a bug in how mdbm is talking to mmap/vfs layer, or more likely within XFS&#x27;s implementation, but it doesn&#x27;t seem like they are slowing you down.<p>In general, mdbm is most useful for storing and accessing compact rows in memory across potentially many processes with a random access pattern, which IMHO is not the problem space that you are testing and tackling with LMDB, LevelDB, or many of the others. One can (rightly) argue that that is a fairly narrow and simple problem space, but as with almost anything in computer science, doing even fairly narrow and simple things efficiently (and mdbm has a number of clever design choices that help it be efficient) and in an error free fashion is enough trouble that having a standard tool for solving that problem is terribly useful.<p>MDBM isn&#x27;t really the only tool for solving that problem out there. Pretty much any shared memory hash table based solution may be a good fit for it, and there are alternative data structures that have desirable advantages over hash tables (critbit based structures are one of my favourite pets for such problems). Heck, in C++ I&#x27;ve used the Boost.IPC library&#x27;s unordered maps for the job with reasonable results.<p>I bet there are probably some implementations that perform better than mdbm in certain cases (I&#x27;d actually be interested in benchmarks comparing that kind of workload with other tools designed for that problem space). Still, the mdbm codebase is battle hardened and really does perform well as long as your data set size & access patterns don&#x27;t cause thrashing of the page store.",1418849177

We really need something that allows creation of pseudonyms without allowing one party to create lots of them cheaply and spam. Facebook, Yelp, and Wikipedia would be standing in line to buy a technology for that.<p>Unfortunately, Dissent can&#x27;t do that.

I will explain why the economics of this market is very broken, & if there were any industry ripe for disruption, this would be it.<p>The numbers:<p>Avg apt rental in NYC = $4,000/mo or $48,000/yr. source: Elliman, 2014.<p>Broker fee ranges from 1 month rent to 15% of full year = $4,000-$7,200 (paid by renter)<p>Time to photograph: 1 hr<p>Time to list on Zillow / Craigslist: 1 hr<p>Time to show to 9 prospects: 3 hrs (20 mins per showing)<p>Time to process paperwork (lease + credit check): 1 hour<p>Total hours invested: 6<p>Total earned per hour @ 12% commission: $6912/6 = $1,152.00.<p>Now you may say that any renter that chooses to use a broker is doing so as a luxury, as there are many no-fee buildings / listings on the market. Not necessarily so. If a desired unit is in a condo/coop vs. a rental building, it is often held by broker, & paying the fee is required to get in the door. Remember that in NYC, renter pays the commission. The owner is often inclined to hire a broker as it appears as if the work to rent it is done at no cost to him/her. However, renters will look at the total cost of rent + brokerage fees, when making a decision, just as shoppers look at the cost of item + s&h + tax when making a purchasing decision. If the owner were to list it themselves, or hire someone at $X/hr, it will likely yield a higher rent since the renter does not have to incur the expense of the broker. Back to the &quot;no-fee&quot; scenario. These landlords know that since the renter is saving the broker fee, that savings, or some portion of it can be baked into the rent. Similar to how free s&h is often not really &#x27;free&#x27;, as it inflates the total cost of the goods sold.<p>My argument is that a better model is to compensate the agent hourly vs. commission. Even at a handsome $50-$100/hr for the labor, it would result in higher rent for landlord, lower rent for the renter, & a healthy profit for the agent.<p>Make sense? Is there something I am missing?

I&#x27;m not sure how feasible this would be in a large enclosed space, my initial concern would be the development of pockets of high helium and low oxygen concentration but perhaps a simple ventilation system could keep the air mixed at an acceptable ratio.  I believe oxygen-helium was considered for the Apollo missions but not used.<p>According to some quick calculations a mixture of 22% oxygen and 78% helium would have a gas density of 0.423 kg/m3 at 20 deg C. I used (density1<i>vol1 + density2</i>vol2) / (vol1 + vol2) with density1 = 1.331 and density2 = 0.1664 and a total volume of 1000m3.<p>The fact that Venus&#x27; gravitation is only 90% of Earth&#x27;s and further (though slightly) modified due to the height of 50 km above the surface would mean that the gravitational attraction would be somewhere around 8.722 m/s2 which is about 88.9% Earth standard.<p>A Venusian (Venerian?) habitat also has the benefit of less disastrous consequences of developing a small leak in the wall of the habitat since the pressure differential would not be so great though an all out failure of atmospheric containment would unfortunately not be at all survivable even if protective equipment were being worn at the time.  The only chance would be immediate activation of the ascent vehicle.  Although I would be curious to know if the entire habitat could be constructed in such a way as to remain a rigid shape once it had been deployed, possibly in the form of a Hybrid Airship or Dynastat[1] This could allow a longer grace period on evacuation should it be necessary and might have added benefits to maneuverability during the mission.  Take off and landing concerns could be ignored since there would be none other than the initial mid-descent inflation and fuel capacity would only be limited by the available sunlight.<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hybrid_airship#Dynastats"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hybrid_airship#Dynastats</a>",1418847319

8764020,comment,8762662,8763376,0,0,jlees,,,"Well, junior developers are just that: junior. That definition can range from &#x27;just finished a coding bootcamp&#x27; to &#x27;4 years of CS with a bunch of practical internships&#x27;. Depending where a developer is on that spectrum, they may behave very differently when given a problem and a bunch of time to solve it.<p>For example, they might not realise that they should be looking into the framework. They may be scared to ask stupid questions because they don&#x27;t think they deserve the job in the first place. They got a bit of harsh feedback from someone who didn&#x27;t take their level into account, and mentioned a whole bunch of things they&#x27;d never heard of before, and now they&#x27;re running around in circles panicking. But not saying anything about it.<p>Obviously a lot of this boils down to &quot;it depends on the person&quot; and none of this may be true. But here are a few thoughts:<p>Take a step back and think about what the expectations are and whether those are communicated at all. Assign a specific senior developer as an active mentor, and coach them on how to give constructive feedback if they aren&#x27;t very good at it (it&#x27;s a growth opportunity for them). Suggest reading lists, talks, and examples of best practices - including stuff that makes working on a team smoother, like source control, etc. Pair program for the first week or two. Code reviews (as small as possible), design reviews, and even giving them <i>less</i> freedom at first so they get confident rather than overwhelmed. Check in frequently so you don&#x27;t get a steaming pile that could hopefully have been avoided :)",1418846765

I think history gives its students two key skills:<p>(1) You have to wade through a lot of complexity and nuance, try to find the signal in the noise, and then marshall some of that complexity to support your argument. After you&#x27;ve speedwalked through thousands of pages of archival documents and other scholars&#x27; arguments, it&#x27;s comparatively easy to be thrown ~50 pages of framework or API documentation and quickly find what you need. (That&#x27;s also why I&#x27;m excited that Common Core puts greater emphasis on reading non-fiction to learn skills, instead of every English class being about reading fiction for pleasure. It builds the same skills.)<p>(2) You get used to the feeling that you know only a tiny fraction of what there is to know about the world. That intellectual humility leads you to ask good questions, try empathizing with perspectives and ideas that may seem strange at first glance, and only make careful assertions that are supported by strong evidence.<p>And by no means do I think history is the only academic discipline teaching students these things. I just wish it got more respect!",1418846590

The tea-party folks are bringing violence to US politics and the G20 thugs are crumpets and milk.<p>> While the videos themselves seem legit, I'd rather not leave exposes of political groups up to their political enemies.<p>Bully for you, but they're pretty much the only folks willing to do the work.<p>If you don't like the way news is made, make your own.",1254027048
846538,comment,846467,846467,0,0,blasdel,,,"I'm inordinately fond of using decorators for adding metadata attributes as markup on functions:<p><pre><code>  def add_example(*args):

      fn.examples.insert(0, args)
      return fn

I use decorators like this to add extra command-line options to methods, annotate what types to construct from a command-line string, add typed __doc__ extensions, note example input/output for unit testing and documentation, etc.",1254026732

Ordered it in paperback, looking forward to rereading the final copy.<p>Seems pretty up the middle as he tends to attack all sides who spout off bullshit numbers. However, there's going to be a lot of political hate for this book. Oh well, that's the world we live in. Truth and pure data analysis is very under appreciated in todays hyper partisan political environment.",1254026535

I like its non-preachy style and its very limited and seemingly well executed approach of supplying the reader nearly exclusively with baseline numbers. This is what we have â€“ we only have to find out what we can change and how.<p>I also like that for once I get a realistic and detailed approximation of my energy usage. There are quite a few surprises in there.",1254026453

Either they don't sue and don't disclose and the result is no one trusts them enough to pay for their polling  (after all, what's the point in paying for a poll if it's going to come under question afterwards?) or they'll sue while not releasing the support for their polls/data on their merits  - and that also opens them up to discovery which could be even more damaging.<p>The best case scenario at this point is if they can publicly prove Nate Silver is wrong.  And based on their policies in the past of not releasing the additional supporting data, I suspect this won't happen.",1254025553

846517,comment,846310,846509,0,0,cwan,,,"There were multiple Acorn workers in question (you can see the 4-5 videos off of the original site that launched it at Andrew Breitbart's biggovernment.com site).  That being said, the fact that Acorn fired this particular woman really undermines their defense.  Given the many other serious allegations against the organization however, it is good to know that the Obama Administration has called for an investigation into Acorn's activities.<p>I think this only reinforces the original point that we need more investigations like this and people who are willing to challenge various organizations and governments - and further - that traditional media outlets are often either unable (given the breadth of targets/perceived costs) or unwilling (possibly because of ideology?) to do it.<p>[On Glenn Reynolds, you'll find that he has been less than supportive of Republicans pointing out that the 'tea parties' are less about being pro-Republican as they are about being more a reaction to greater government interventions - which were started under the previous Republican administration]",1254024430

In a well-functioning media environment, it would be sufficient to seriously damage the credibility of the pollster involved (Strategic Vision), or at least shift the burden to them to explain their behavior.<p>Instead, we already see clues about what will happen: the pollster is threatening a lawsuit, which will be a sure loser but nonetheless drain resources and time from its target (either Nate himself or fivethirtyeight). The polls from the offending pollster will, I'm completely certain, be reported with utter credulity in the 2010 election cycle and beyond. The fact that the books are cooked will not even be mentioned in media reports, and will ultimately matter not at all.<p>This is because we simply do not have a well-functioning media environment.",1254024238

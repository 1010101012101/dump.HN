How long does it take me to get dressed? How long does it take to get to my car and my actual commute, etc. With some real numbers, you can start to be realistic about what it takes you to get to work and so you can work backwards from there to make sure you leave on time.

I had a couple engineering degrees, and could have easily gotten a new job if I&#x27;d failed.  If I risked my savings now and failed it would have a much more significant impact on my life.<p>One way to understand this is to include employment capital in your calculations.  A person with $10k in the bank has considerably more employment capital than investment capital.  A person with $50M in the bank has insignificant employment capital compared to their investment capital.  So risking 99% of their investment capital would be considerably more, as a percentage of their total capital, than the first person risking their entire $10k.",1431748269

Like how DUI laws only apply to people who choose to drive, vaccines are simply the cost of entry to the public school system.<p>> do you see a difference between government mandating vaccinations and government mandated sterilization or abortion of certain individuals with certain genes/DNA?<p>If you can bypass the law by a simple step like not sending your children to public school, and the abortion/sterilization significantly decreases both the risk of death to the person receiving the operation and the general public, then I suspect I would not be opposed to such a measure.

9554977,comment,9549841,9552826,0,0,lisper,,,"> Erik clearly states that he thinks the attribute/element distinction is &quot;_incredibly_ stupid,&quot;<p>Yes.  And I&#x27;m saying he&#x27;s wrong.  Not only is he wrong, he&#x27;s <i>clearly</i> wrong.  Not only is it not &quot;incredibly stupid&quot;, the distinction between attributes and elements is both reasonable and useful.  And the <i>reason</i> it&#x27;s reasonable and useful is because it reflects a reasonable and useful distinction between data and metadata.<p>> What is an example of this distinction between attributes and elements which is not just syntax?<p>I don&#x27;t understand that question.<p>My claim is that, in the context of markup languages, there is a useful distinction to be made between data and metadata, and that this distinction is useful enough that it is not unreasonable to make this distinction syntactically.  Of course, it doesn&#x27;t <i>have</i> to be made syntactically.  In Lisp, there is no syntactic difference between function calls and control constructs.  Consider:<p>(foo (baz bar) bing)<p>Is (bar bar) a function call?  If FOO is a macro that expands to:<p>(dotimes (baz bar) bing)<p>then BAZ is a variable binding.  Arguably, it would be worthwhile to make a syntactic distinction here.  For example, you could use square brackets for variable bindings, so that you could tell that in:<p>(foo [baz bar] bing)<p>BAZ was a variable binding without having to know how FOO was defined.  It&#x27;s not a slam dunk, but it is a defensible position.<p>Likewise, it is a defensible position that the difference between <foo baz=bar>bing</foo> and <foo><baz>bar</baz></foo> -- whatever that difference might actually be in practice -- is valuable and ought to be preserved.  Again, not a slam-dunk, but a defensible position.<p>What makes Erik clearly wrong is this his rendering of <foo baz=bar>bing</foo> is NOT actually any simpler than a rendering that preserves the attribute/element distinction.  His rendering has EXACTLY the same level of nesting, the same number of tokens.  The ONLY difference is the location of a paren.  And the way he moves the paren, he loses information.  Without a compelling argument why moving that paren has more value than the information that he loses, that paren ought not to be moved.  All else being equal (and in this case all else is equal) it is better to keep information than to lose it.  Not only does Erik not make a compelling argument, he makes no argument at all.  He simply proclaims that it is &quot;incredibly stupid&quot; and his acolytes, for reasons passing my comprehension, agree.",1431747924

It would have verged on the monopoly abuse of which MS was in fact convicted.<p>My point was not that JS must be the only way to run Dart simply because I or anyone at Mozilla (or anywhere else, MS and Apple included) prefers JS. That would be dumb, and it&#x27;s clearly not what I wrote.<p>Browser vendors have to keep JS improving. That&#x27;s a given. Adding the extra costs of DartVM and the inter-heap GC and write barriers to glue it into the shared DOM client side is a huge tax, which would have helped kill Mozilla faster. MS and Apple wouldn&#x27;t pay that tax. Why should anyone? Again it&#x27;s not about JS being uncompetitive. &quot;Competitive&quot; is what browsers are when they run web content better and faster. Dart has very little to do with this.<p>JS is very, very hard to replace, for reasons I summed up as &quot;physics&quot; (apologies to Rutherford) and won&#x27;t belabor here. Yet the Dash memo proposed to do just that, to replace JS, using lame assertions about how JS couldn&#x27;t be fixed.<p>That was not just lame posturing and excuse-making for a Lars Bak retention program. Given Google&#x27;s power, it was a disservice to the Web as a standards-based and ever-evolving platform, whose caretakers are obligated to keep working on it in the open, not try proprietary end-runs. (Yes, of course, many people at Google work hard to improve the Web. Good for them, but not relevant to what happened with Dash.)<p>I&#x27;m happy to say I was wrong to worry about Google succeeding in acting like MS did with ActiveX/VBScript. Not that some at Google didn&#x27;t try (or won&#x27;t again with other stuff), but they failed with Dart. I predicted that, too, as an ultimate outcome after wasting years and megabucks -- including real opportunity costs to V8 and JS.

Should they go around, try to merge and hope they don&#x27;t misgauge the distance?<p>The problem here is that the city didn&#x27;t put any real thought into the bikes lanes, and the result is a terrible and incredibly dangerous system.<p>Personally, I&#x27;ve given up on bike lanes in many areas of the city. It&#x27;s simply not safe.",1431745237

6308561,comment,6307236,6307236,25,0,BrentOzar,,,"I&#x27;m a Microsoft Certified Master myself (of SQL Server) so I&#x27;ll explain a little about what&#x27;s got everybody up in arms.<p>When you do enterprise admin work, you often can&#x27;t share that work publicly. It&#x27;s not like someone can look at my DBA.StackExchange profile and see the deployments I&#x27;ve done for StackExchange, AllRecipes, Discovery, etc. The MCM was Microsoft&#x27;s highest technical certification that gauged your sysadmin skills, so that work you&#x27;ve done for high end enterprise systems pays off here. When other high end companies came to call, I could say, &quot;I&#x27;m an MCM. There&#x27;s only a couple hundred of us worldwide, and most of them work for Microsoft as consultants - I&#x27;m one of the few independents.&quot; Combine that with references, and it&#x27;s just easier to get doors opened.<p>Of course, it only makes sense if the certification is actually hard - and hoowee, was it hard. Originally, it involved spending 6 weeks onsite at Microsoft undergoing a series of tests, culminating in a monster 6-hour hands-on lab test. It was the toughest 6 hours of my life, and I&#x27;ve gone through some pretty tough outages. There were no braindumps that could get you past the MCM (unlike the near-worthless MCITP exams.)<p>Unfortunately, the MCM was too hard to achieve for most folks, and they couldn&#x27;t get the market adoption they wanted. It&#x27;s really expensive to write and administer these kinds of high-end tests, and Microsoft was faced with updating the tests faster and faster due to the faster release cycles coming out on the software side. Worse, they wanted the Master certification to cover not just on-premise software, but cloud services as well, so you had to test Master-level skills across both - but the cloud services changed constantly. (Heck, the MCITP-level tests for Windows Azure SQL Database still has the wrong marketing brand name on it even today.)<p>Just ended up being too expensive for them to manage in the face of limited adoption.<p>The current MCMs are bummed because it cost us a ton of money and time to get certified, and we never saw significant benefits from the program. The best resource was the mailing list. (I&#x27;m not bummed because the cert has paid off the initial investment for me, even though I put out something like $25k total out of pocket.)<p>People who are currently working on their MCMs are bummed out because they&#x27;ve invested a lot of money and time (in some cases, international flights & hotels) and they won&#x27;t finish in time.",1377993476

I have installed Windows often enough to know how much work it is to turn a Stock windows machine into something tolerable.   Things like Ninight try to serve that need as best as possible but being able to spin it into an actual distro would mean you could potentially make a Windows that was truly targeted to what users wanted intead of pushing Microsoft&#x27;s technology du jour.",1377993473

6308541,comment,6307514,6308152,3,0,dalke,,,"Interesting! Though in reviewing the second link I find very little that was definite. It recounts things second- and third-hand. Some claim a single tree could provide water for 8,000 people and their animals, another said for 80 families. Some say it was a single tree, others from multiple trees.<p>You say &quot;otherwise uninhabitable land&quot;, but Brown&#x27;s 1910 guide book points out that people lived there, grew grains, and pastured animals. As there are &quot;practically no springs&quot;, people needed to build cisterns to catch rainwater. The translated Spanish document (from the last 1500s?) says there are three streams on the island, and that the tree (which was not seen by the Spaniard) is a third type of water source.<p>Since the 1910 inhabitants didn&#x27;t use this tree as a water source, I presume that cisterns and those small springs were enough for them, and so would have been enough for the Bimbache.<p>For that matter, how did the first Bimbache live there if it was otherwise uninhabitable. Did they need to find the tree(s) before they could settle?<p>You write &quot;which directed water straight to their dwellings&quot; but Duret (1605) writes that the tanks of water were at the foot of the tree, and that the remnants from the 1612 storm were still there in 1753. But I don&#x27;t see anything in those accounts about channels or pipes leading the water to people&#x27;s homes. (The Wikipedia page says &quot;The Bimbaches later filled water chaffs and water was transported to towns to all parts of the island&quot;, but as part of a legend, and without a citation.)<p>This is not me rejecting the idea that fog collection was done before the 1980s. Indeed, the Wikipedia page for &#x27;Fog collection&#x27; lists several &quot;natural or assisted&quot; collection methods. Nor am I rejecting the idea that the Bimbache used trees as a fog collector.<p>What I&#x27;m commenting on is that the information I&#x27;ve read is suggestive, but not definitive, and that what I&#x27;ve read doesn&#x27;t fully match with what you wrote here.<p>What I would like to see might include measurements of water run-off from one of those trees, growing in the same area and archeological evidence of an irrigation system, rather than carrying water from cisterns.<p>BTW, I really like one of the accounts in that second link about that sense of astonishment by the British scientists at Cape Town who, 110 years ago or so, found out that the fog around Table mountain provides a huge amount of water.",1377992715

6308534,comment,6307748,6308502,1,0,parennoob,,,"> The US problem is that there are not enough people to process the enormous number of applications the country receives. The India problem is that the workers aren&#x27;t paid well enough, resulting in a culture of bribery.<p>I don&#x27;t exactly see the validity of this argument. There are a lot of people without jobs in the USA right now. Last I checked the unemployment rate was pretty high. So if I understand correctly, what you are saying is that the Government in the States does not have enough money, or for some reason, is not willing to pay people to process these applications.<p>Neither does the Indian Government. It&#x27;s pretty cash-strapped as well. You are right that this does lead to bribery in the Indian scenario, and just plain slowness of processing in the US one. The end result for legal immigrants, as I have already said, is pretty similar.<p>>  For some reason you seem to think that bribery is common in the US immigration system.<p>Not exactly. Look below for why I do think this is true, indirectly.<p>>The US has an ample amount of institutionalized corruption in the form of lobbying.<p>In the US, &quot;political lobbying&quot; involving donations of millions of dollars routed through channels too diffuse for the common person to understand can result in laws being changed, leading to &quot;legal&quot; routes to whatever you want.

The late Professor Lykken himself wrote a whole book on why polygraph examinations are a bad idea,<p><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/A-Tremor-In-The-Blood/dp/0306457822"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/A-Tremor-In-The-Blood/dp/0306457822</a><p>and his writings helped convince the Minnesota legislature not to allow polygraph results for any judicial or employment-screening purpose in the state. It&#x27;s ludicrous that the federal government and some state judicial systems still rely so much on such an inherently unreliable, unvalidated technology.<p>&quot;We are especially grateful to retired FBI Supervisory Special Agent Dr. Drew C. Richardson for his suggestions regarding the second edition of this book.&quot;<p>Yes, after being burned by false polygraph results many times, SOME (but not enough) federal law enforcement agents are recognizing that polygraph examinations are useless for finding the truth.",1377991701

The India problem is that the workers aren&#x27;t paid well enough, resulting in a culture of bribery.

Sales people then complain that nothing ever gets done, and requests go into a vacuum, while engineers complain about too much bureaucracy and inability to concentrate on large projects with all the pesky requests streaming in.",1377990158

The one feature I would not expect to see using a tool like this is realistic rendition of the dialogue. I know that is not technologically feasible. What I would expect to do in abscence of that, is be able to set the mood of the scene through lighting and colour, have a wider camera angle and movement vocabulary, and a wider range of interactions between the actors. This would make it a powerful previz tool and it would help tell the story closer to the writers intent in the absence of human reading the script. Just some of my thoughts. It would also be nice to see a linux version of this too. I can&#x27;t see experienced writers using this, but they may not be the target audience. Who is the target audience by the way?",1377990083

This is the start of whatever changes - good or bad, are going to come.<p>Especially, if the NSA gets the changes it wants from the situation, talking about the insecurity of a network would become illegal and bad security practices could be papered over.

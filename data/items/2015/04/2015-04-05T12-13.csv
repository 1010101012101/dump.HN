There&#x27;s a whole industry in the US that buys up public records, cross-references them and sells them as &#x27;background checks&#x27;.  Buy a house? Your name and address is now a public record.  Sign up for Cable TV/Internet with free phone service thrown in?  Hope you checked to pay the extra &#x27;unlisted number&#x27; fee because otherwise your name address and phone number are now in the phone book.  Ever have to settle something in court?  Your name and address, along with whatever you went to court over are now publicly available.<p>In the past you&#x27;d actually have to go to some county government office to view the records, but these companies will collect them in bulk and sell the information on the internet.  Most of them will let you claim it and take down the information for free, but then go on to offer sell you services where they go and send take down notifications to a bunch of other sites.  It&#x27;s a huge racket.",1428238793

Whatever you want to do in the future at some point it&#x27;ll be too late. Once you hit your 30s priorities start to shift. You start thinking about having a family. This means you&#x27;ll need stable lifestyle not just in terms of money, but also in terms of work hours (= no startups). Excessive travel is no longer possible. Perhaps you need to take care of your parents. Or you may simply become complacent with your current lifestyle (this happens unconsciously more than consciously). Suddenly the startups, travel and fun that the money was supposed seem a lot more risky and unrealistic than they seemed when you were in the beginning of your 20s.<p>I&#x27;m all for saving.

Businesses also need to stop auto filtering people who don&#x27;t have a degree, and that&#x27;s something that you&#x27;d actually have to fight for to get removed, meaning most hiring managers won&#x27;t be arsed to take up that fight.

9323826,comment,9322600,9322758,0,0,mjklin,,,"&quot;Those who contend that knowledge results wholly from the experiences of the individual, ignoring as they do the mental evolution which accompanies the autogenous development of the nervous system, fall into an error as great as if they were to ascribe all bodily growth and structure to exercise, forgetting the innate tendency to assume the adult form. Were the infant born with a full-sized and completely-constructed brain, their position would be less untenable. But, as the case stands, the gradually-increasing intelligence displayed throughout childhood and youth is more attributable to the completion of the cerebral organization than to the individual experiences -- a truth proved by the fact that in adult life there is sometimes displayed a high endowment of some faculty which, during education, was never brought into play.<p>&quot;Doubtless, experiences received by the individual furnish the concrete materials for all thought. Doubtless, the organized and semiorganized arrangements existing among the cerebral nerves can give no knowledge until there has been a presentation of the external relations to which they correspond. And doubtless the child&#x27;s daily observations and reasonings aid the formation of those involved nervous connections that are in process of spontaneous evolution; just as its daily gambols aid the development of its limbs. But saying this is quite a different thing from saying that its intelligence is wholly produced by its experiences. That is an utterly inadmissible doctrine -- a doctrine which makes the presence of a brain meaningless -- a doctrine which makes idiocy unaccountable.&quot;<p>- William James, The Principles of Psychology, 1890 (though he is quoting Herbert Spencer here)<p>I wonder if anyone has improved on this view in the century-plus since it was published?",1428236099

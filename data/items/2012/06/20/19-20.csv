4138838,comment,4137083,4138658,4,0,suresk,,,"I've spent a lot of time learning about the decision to dropping atomic bombs on Japan, and it is quite nuanced. I'm still not 100% sure if it was the correct course of action, given the information available at the time.<p>First, any attempt at an invasion of mainland Japan would have likely resulted in horrendous casualties for both sides - and it is almost certain that civilian casualties would have been substantially higher in the event of an invasion.<p>To counter that point, it is unlikely that an invasion would have been required to secure a surrender, and American insistence on unconditional surrender was a factor in prolonging the war with Japan.<p>Third, there is at least some merit to the idea that dropping the bombs wasn't just meant to scare the Japanese - it was also meant to demonstrate their power to the USSR.<p>Incidentally, it is pretty clear that Truman and other Allied leaders saw the Japanese as being sub-human in some ways[1]. How much of this came from societal factors and how much of it came from experiences of the absolutely brutal Pacific campaign battles is debatable, but it is certainly unfair to lay it all at the feet of Disney.<p>1. <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debate_over_the_atomic_bombings_of_Hiroshima_and_Nagasaki#Racism_and_dehumanization"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debate_over_the_atomic_bombings...</a>",1340222371

Apologies if it came across as such.<p>>> I do think that being readable by a larger audience is an advantage, all else being equal, to being readable by a smaller audience.<p>I don't necessarily disagree with this statement, all I am pointing out is that there are limits to how wide an audience a given paper can address. Specifically in more abstract papers (e.g. philosophical papers) is a profound knowledge important, especially in the history of thought and the foundations of our modern philosophy, together with the objections raised along the way. To give just one example, if you want to actually talk about something as abstract as postmodernism (an internet favourite, as shown also by xkcd etc.), you will need to know about its genesis, about its criticism of structuralism, modernism, idealism, society, art as an institution, the avant-garde movements etc. All I am saying is while addressing a wider audience is an admirable goal, it becomes harder and harder to achieve the higher the paper's complexity.<p>>> In an experimental paper, sure, the abstract is written last.<p>Coming from a non-experimental background, I still don't know anyone writing their abstract first. First comes an interest, an idea, something one doesn't understand, believes to understand, something one finds irritating, interesting etc. Then one keeps digging deeper, looking at other people's work and interpretation while simultaneously structuring one's ideas, arguments and problems. The abstract of a paper -- in my opinion -- can only be given after this process of sorting and structuring, of testing, evaluating and discarding is over. So I would like to disagree that a philosophical paper is the result of a vastly different thought process in terms of structure and argumentation.",1340222367

That is not the reality of business.  Today it seems that the entrepreneurial spirit is being watered down, because it is considered ""ok"" to create a service with no monetization strategy or goal and simply hope for an acquisition.  I believe competition breeds innovation as well as better businesses.  It isn't about startup vs startup, it's about business vs business.  Personally, I'm not building a company to see how many ""friends"" I can make (and subsequently share random thoughts and photos with).

4138737,comment,4138335,4138335,35,0,rmk2,,,"There is a reason why <i>conferences</i> are so hugely important. Often, what will be published as an article is presented beforehand on conferences, among knowledgable and interested peers. And while some conferences are invite-only or have to be paid for, most universities have a lot of conferences either completely open to the public or at least open to students. Often, just <i>asking</i> someone of one is allowed to just audit the talks without going to all he social events aimed at invited people will be enough in order to be ""let it"".<p>Overall, what bothers me most about this blog post is this:<p>>> Papers are, intentionally, written for an audience of specialists rather than a general interest group, which reduces both the tendency and ability of non-specialists to read them when asked<p>This repeats the same bias that <i>everyone can say something about everything</i>. Nobody here would complain that mailing list discussions about bugs, features or programming questions are hard to understand for non-programmers. However, a scientific discussion in a paper is supposed to cater to everyone. In reality, especially within the confined spaces of an article, one has to assume some baseline of knowledge in the reader, because one can't afford to explain all the basics one implicitly builds upon. To give an example: I do literary studies, and often people assume that they know <i>just as much</i> without having properly dealt with it, because <i>hey, everyone can read a book, right? right?</i> While that part might be true, every scientific discipline over time builds up a plethora of instruments for analysis of their respective topics, an understanding of the matter's and the subject's history, its pitfalls, shortcomings and strengths.<p>Also, I do not understand his paragraph regarding the ""bottom line"", since I know noone who writes the abstract first. The abstract is the very last bit to be written, <i>after</i> the paper's structure, arguments, theses, supporting evidence and rebuttals are decided, fixed and usually written. What both the cited Paul Graham essay and his text fail to see is the <i>process of writing a paper</i>. It is true that the actual writing process usually doesn't start with a thesis statement and a chain of arguments. But structuring a paper is just as much part of writing as finding words for what one wants to express.<p>The author hints at being an undergrad in maths, having trouble with the understanding of state of the art research. A professor I know once said this about degrees: undergrad & grad work are a necessity, they teach how to start a car, how to accelerate, break and also drive on basic roads (research methods/skills). A PhD then allows (and teaches) you to drive on the autobahn (research), where you can start to close the gap somewhat to all the people already on it going faster than you do. The actual entry into novel research doesn't happen until after the PhD. That's where journals and conferences, workshops, groups, funding etc. become interesting and important. First then are you within the actual target group for academic papers, since you are seen as an <i>equal</i>, equal also in terms of discussing on eye level.<p>Nobody expects complex technology etc. to be understandable by everyone, but one could say: ""Everyone thinks they are a writer, much like many people stand in front of contemporary art saying they could produce the same thing."" What they fail to understand is the complexity involved in the writing <i>process</i>. What sometimes looks easy or even ""trivial"" in a finished paper often has a highly complex, dense and far-reaching background.<p>[edit] Mhm...I apologise for the length of this comment, it grew larger than I originally thought it would...

4138722,comment,4136363,4137319,1,0,talmand,,,"Ok, here are my thoughts on how I break down the article.<p>The intro and first section have nothing to do with anything other than his own personal preferences. He doesn't use his tablet that often so he's assuming others have the same experience. But then he talks so highly of the iPad as if the experience with it is simply better only because it's an iPad. Doesn't it seem likely that the possibly experience he describes for an Android tablet can possibly be the same with iPad? With him apparently it is not. The iPad is better because he seems to think it is. Somehow it's just better with little or no evidence as to what he's talking about. He uses his phone more than his tablet. So what? Seems to me he bought something he didn't want or need.<p>By the way, I like the iPad but I'll never buy one. Why? Personal preference. I don't even have to say that the iPad and iTunes have problems that Apple really needs to work on or Google/Microsoft will take over the market.<p>In the second section he does make some good points as to why the iPad is so successful but he couldn't help but toss in his own opinion yet again about the Android tablets. Android bad, iPad good. We get it already. The only real reason he gives for Android falling behind is that Google is late to the game with content, which no one disputes. But then he goes right back into tossing out his personal preferences as if it matters. He apparently likes iTunes over what Google offers. That's nice; nice for him. I, for one, have little problems with how I get content for my Android tablet. My opinion in the matter has as much weight as his. In an attempt to prove his point about design preferences he links to another article complaining about the Play Store that also happens to be on the same site. I didn't bother going there because I'm sure it's more iPad good, Android bad, because, well, because of a ""I think so"" attitude. But then again I didn't read it so I could be wrong.<p>Concerning content, I notice he didn't bring up Amazon's Kindle Fire which directly addresses this issue. From what I understand the Kindle Fire is a big seller but I guess that's not an Android device anymore?<p>Then when he finally gets to the real issue he blames the wrong people. Adoption rates are low for upgrading Android to the latest version is because of the hardware vendors, not Google. That's the core of the problem with this article. Comparing Android tablets with the iPad is not the same as comparing Apple to Google. It's the same mistake too many people make with comparing Apple to Microsoft when what they're really doing is comparing Mac to PC, it is not the same thing. Why do I think Apple is so successful with the iPad? Because they are damn good at creating devices and marketing them. Google is a freaking search engine company that sells ads. Do we not see the difference here?<p>He talks about the lack of Android tablet specific apps. But he himself describes why this is. Why make a tablet specific app for Android when so many of the phones and tablets are not that different in the first place? There's not much difference between a 4.5"" phone screen and a 7"" tablet screen (which I'm guessing a large number of Android tablets sold are) so it becomes more of a fragmentation issue of hardware features not relating to the screen. So far there is a significant difference between an iPhone and an iPad that many apps probably do need a tablet version. Plus that 225,000 number for iPad apps is just marketing talk. Quantity does not equal quality.<p>Also, him stating that a phone app will always look like a phone app on a tablet is yet another personal preference. I have apps on both my phone and tablet that is the same version and I have no problem with that whatsoever. Again, it's an opinion but I admit it's biased because I have a 7"" tablet. A 10"" tablet would probably be an issue, which it is with the iPad.<p>Android developers don't make money from people paying for apps. So what? Developers don't get to dictate terms in how they make money in any given market. Just because one market hands out cash like crazy doesn't mean they all will. If you want to be in a market then you go by what that market wants. If that means $4.99 on iTunes and free with ads on Android then so be it. I've also seen complaints lately that the iOS platform is not the cash cow it used to be. Factors involving people paying out less and just the sheer amount of competition is the usual. Granted, I've only read this so it's no different a comment than what he's making about the Android market.<p>Then there's the Surface tablet. A tablet that we know next to nothing about but he's already practically labeling it an Android killer. It might be, it might not. We don't know and won't know for a while. But his personal opinion has kicked in again and this barely existing product is a winner to him. I personally will wait until I can get my hands on one.<p>I don't agree with his conclusion simply because I feel he doesn't fully understand what Android is and what it means. He only focuses on tablets and I say that tablets are a niche market in the Android ecosystem. Not everybody who wants or needs Android wants or needs a tablet. Until recently Android has been about phones, high and low end. It has been about spreading a free and/or low-cost OS to multiple devices. I don't seen anybody making a cheap $50 computer for emerging markets running iOS, they are using Android. His conclusion assumes that Google can or will do anything about tablets. I say they don't need to, Android is doing exactly what Google has always wanted; to spread like crazy. Most of his complaints are nothing for Google to care about, that's for the individual companies that are creating these tablets to worry over. At least in the final paragraph he finally admits the current state of Android tablets have very little to do with Google itself. But if he admits that then what's the point of the article in the first place?<p>Where do I get the ""give up"" part? His second to last paragraph screams give up to me. But, my interpretation.<p>As I said, I own a Galaxy Tab 2 and I absolutely love it. I use this device every day for various things and it meets my expectations just fine. I also still use my Android phone and I fail to see the problem with that.<p>In the end, this is just my opinion but I admit to that.",1340220931

We don't have to assume that all research is conducted by full-time students/university research assistants.

You may need to travel, you may need resources and equipment, but it should be plausible to get some financial help with that on Kickstarter-like levels.<p>What if you don't see any interesting results in your research?

4138643,comment,4135690,4135690,1,0,tokenadult,,,"Firing is gut-wrenching for the person who does the firing, and for the person who gets fired (of course). The submitted blog post makes the point that sometimes, despite the short-term wrenching of guts, everyone is better off if an employee who doesn't fit in one workplace moves on to another.<p>Several of the interesting comments here ask what connection there is between how someone is hired and whether or not someone will be fired. Even if it's not possible to guarantee that you'll never hire someone whom you'll later need to fire, it sounds like all of us want to reduce the risk of making hiring mistakes that will lead to unpleasant experiences later with employees who just don't fit. With that in mind, I'd like to ask some questions.<p>What hiring procedures are you using now? How structured are your hiring procedures? How much looking ahead to reducing the probability of future firing is built into your hiring procedures?<p>Hacker News readers who haven't seen it recently may be interested in a FAQ document about hiring employees, based on suggestions I've received from several participants here in previous discussions of how companies hire. Many hackers think many companies hire based on crazy procedures. Research suggests that most companies in most places don't use the best available hiring procedures. I'd appreciate comments about the hiring procedures FAQ below.<p>There are many discussions here on HN about company hiring procedures. From participants in earlier discussions I have learned about many useful references on the subject, which I have gathered here in a FAQ file. The review article by Frank L. Schmidt and John E. Hunter, ""The Validity and Utility of Selection Models in Personnel Psychology: Practical and Theoretical Implications of 85 Years of Research Findings,"" Psychological Bulletin, Vol. 124, No. 2, 262-274<p><a href=""http://mavweb.mnsu.edu/howard/Schmidt%20and%20Hunter%201998%20Validity%20and%20Utility%20Psychological%20Bulletin.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://mavweb.mnsu.edu/howard/Schmidt%20and%20Hunter%201998%...</a><p>sums up, current to 1998, a meta-analysis of much of the HUGE peer-reviewed professional literature on the industrial and organizational psychology devoted to business hiring procedures. There are many kinds of hiring criteria, such as in-person interviews, telephone interviews, resume reviews for job experience, checks for academic credentials, and so on. There is much published study research on how job applicants perform after they are hired in a wide variety of occupations.<p>The overall summary of the industrial psychology research in reliable secondary sources is that two kinds of job screening procedures work reasonably well (but only about at the 0.5 level, standing alone). One is a general mental ability (GMA) test (an IQ-like test, such as the Wonderlic personnel screening test). Another is a work-sample test, where the applicant does an actual task or group of tasks like what the applicant will do on the job if hired. Each of these kinds of tests has about the same validity in screening applicants for jobs, with the general mental ability test better predicting success for applicants who will be trained into a new job. Neither is perfect (both miss some good performers on the job, and select some bad performers on the job), but both are better than any other single-factor hiring procedure that has been tested in rigorous research, across a wide variety of occupations. So if you are hiring for your company, it's a good idea to think about how to build a work-sample test into all of your hiring processes.<p>Because of a Supreme Court decision in the United States (the decision does not apply in other countries, which have different statutes about employment), it is legally risk to give job applicants general mental ability tests such as a straight-up IQ test (as was commonplace in my parents' generation) as a routine part of hiring procedures. The Griggs v. Duke Power, 401 U.S. 424 (1971) case<p><a href=""http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=8655598674229196978&q=Griggs+Duke+Power&hl=en&as_sdt=2,24"" rel=""nofollow"">http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=8655598674229196...</a><p>interpreted a federal statute about employment discrimination and held that general intelligence tests used in hiring that could have a ""disparate impact"" on applicants of some protected classes must ""bear a demonstrable relationship to successful performance of the jobs for which it was used."" In other words, a company that wants to use a test like the Wonderlic, or like the SAT, or like the current WAIS or Stanford-Binet IQ tests, in a hiring procedure had best conduct a specific validation study of the test related to performance on the job in question. Some companies do the validation study, and use IQ-like tests in hiring. Other companies use IQ-like tests in hiring and hope that no one sues (which is not what I would advise any company). Note that a brain-teaser-type test used in a hiring procedure could be challenged as illegal if it can be shown to have disparate impact on some job applicants. A company defending a brain-teaser test for hiring would have to defend it by showing it is supported by a validation study demonstrating that the test is related to successful performance on the job. Such validation studies can be quite expensive. (Companies outside the United States are regulated by different laws. One other big difference between the United States and other countries is the relative ease with which workers may be fired in the United States, allowing companies to correct hiring mistakes by terminating the employment of the workers they hired mistakenly. The more legal protections a worker has from being fired, the more careful companies have to be about hiring in the first place.)<p>The social background to the legal environment in the United States is explained in many books about hiring procedures<p><a href=""http://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=SRv-GZkw6TEC&oi=fnd&pg=PA271&dq=Validity+and+Utility+of+Selection+Models+in+Personnel+Psychology&ots=iCXkgXrlOV&sig=ctblj9SW2Dth7TceaFSNIdVMoEw#v=onepage&q=Validity%20and%20Utility%20of%20Selection%20Models%20in%20Personnel%20Psychology&f=false"" rel=""nofollow"">http://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=SRv-GZkw6...</a><p><a href=""http://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=SRv-GZkw6TEC&oi=fnd&pg=PA95&dq=Validity+and+Utility+of+Selection+Models+in+Personnel+Psychology&ots=iCXkgXrnMW&sig=LKLi-deKtnP20VYZo9x0jfvqzLI#v=onepage&q=Validity%20and%20Utility%20of%20Selection%20Models%20in%20Personnel%20Psychology&f=false"" rel=""nofollow"">http://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=SRv-GZkw6...</a><p>Some of the social background appears to be changing in the most recent few decades, with the prospect for further changes.<p><a href=""http://intl-pss.sagepub.com/content/17/10/913.full"" rel=""nofollow"">http://intl-pss.sagepub.com/content/17/10/913.full</a><p><a href=""http://www.economics.harvard.edu/faculty/fryer/files/Fryer_Racial_Inequality.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.economics.harvard.edu/faculty/fryer/files/Fryer_R...</a><p><a href=""http://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=frfUB3GWlMYC&oi=fnd&pg=PA9&dq=Validity+and+Utility+of+Selection+Models+in+Personnel+Psychology+%22predictive+validity%22+Duke+Power&ots=5O9Hx_E1vY&sig=g-zERWztBWq3h4guEuv9VVkTh8I#v=onepage&q=Validity%20and%20Utility%20of%20Selection%20Models%20in%20Personnel%20Psychology%20%22predictive%20validity%22%20Duke%20Power&f=false"" rel=""nofollow"">http://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=frfUB3GWl...</a><p>Previous discussion on HN pointed out that the Schmidt & Hunter (1998) article showed that multi-factor procedures work better than single-factor procedures, a summary of that article we can find in the current professional literature, in ""Reasons for being selective when choosing personnel selection procedures"" (2010) by Cornelius J. Knig, Ute-Christine Klehe, Matthias Berchtold, and Martin Kleinmann:<p>""Choosing personnel selection procedures could be so simple: Grab your copy of Schmidt and Hunter (1998) and read their Table 1 (again).

For example, the highly valid work sample tests are hardly used in the US, and the potentially rather useless procedure of graphology (Dean, 1992; Neter & Ben-Shakhar, 1989) is applied somewhere between occasionally and often in France (Ryan et al., 1999). In Germany, the use of GMA tests is reported to be low and to be decreasing (i.e., only 30% of the companies surveyed by Schuler et al., 2007, now use them).""",1340219939

4138609,comment,4138009,4138009,3,0,nerdfiles,,,"I first simply want to address the smoking bit. _Something_ about smoking is habitual, or rather, not to see that a drug addiction could instantiate or engender a habit which itself re-enforces the addiction, might be the main problematic of 'quitting advice.' Rather, ignoring that cigarettes prompt a way of life only suggests to me that said advice treats an idealized person, or biological system, a model.<p>We are not models. In my comment history I've noted that Juan Enriquez talks of 'living organisms,' not 'life.' Again here I wish to point out a semantic mix up. We are a mix where the advice is technically valid: we have a bio-logical imperative as an organism to reduce or differentiate  carcinogen-affected cells, waste, etc. Our bodies do it and so basically we are duty bound to respect, or harmonize, with our more basic functions. 'Just quit' ignores the basic psychological component of smoking, even if that component cannot be exhaustively explained as habit. Habit has two primary forms, situational and dispositional.<p>When we say, 'Just quit!' We suggest that the dispositional habit is indeed ficticious. It _is_ an addiction. Being internally compelled implies a form of determinism that the agent in truth has no basis for judgement. To suggest that one has such a habit implies a personal capability to predict the conclusion of one's own habit. That being said, one only admits to the internal rules which drugs instantiates within the biological system of the agent. To one must accept the imperative, should one say it is a habit of this sort.<p>However, a situational habit is different, a more robust problem. At first prompt, we are forced to investigate all the various ways in which cigarette smoking enters public consciousness. To 'quit,' indeed, in similar fashion blocks any fruit that may be drawn from the situational benefits of a situational habit.<p>I, for instance, often decline cigarettes from close friends where the situation prompts a longform discussion. Another friend has mentioned, in passing, ""I don't trust anyone who does not smoke."" Andy Clarke has been lauded for his smoker's style. I personally took rolling on as a Special Interest: I can roll a perfect cigarette, reliably, almost systematically. And if anyone ever asks me to do so, I religiously oblige. This is not an internal habit, but it makes sense to describe it as habtiual in _some_ sense. I might share in some activity with this person, call it 'smoking'.<p>What I am not doing is romanticizing smoking. What I am suggesting is that 'cold turkey' advice should be replaced with descriptive or behavioral models which may lend to therapeutic or narrative models for therapy. 'Just quit' isn't diagnostic, and attempts to reduce the solution to smoking to our basic biological imperative. Fair.<p>Also, easier said that done. -- So actually work to make this advice relevant. It's blindly proscriptive, where integration and therapy should accompany.<p>I mean, may I just put it so prettily: ""freedom from slavery""? Slavery isn't anything like a biological function of nature. When one quits cigarettes, one is avoiding something external to one's self. Slavery isn't some inevitable feature of, trade, or political systems, that one chooses or does not. The whole way of putting it, as freedom from slavery, does more harm than good. I think it misleading and sensationalist. Cigarettes are evolutionarily novel, indeed, but what still remains is that they are a feature of civilization, the mix of the raw forces of selection and human intelligence.",1340219563

If I think a tool is essential or will make the project better in the long run, I use time on the job to learn it. An example would be backbone.js. I recently had to build a complicated UI, and didn't want jQuery soupe (even well tasting soupe), so I went about reading the backbone source and engraining all the details of backbone over a couple of days, then I built the UI and the client and our company benefited from having well-organized, clean code, that is easily maintainable, and also I think it would have been much more difficult in the long run to even build the interface without backbone. As far as languages go, I've never had the ""need"" to learn a new one for a project (usually Bash,C,C++,PHP,Javascript fit the bill for most anything), and so I've always learned new languages in my free time. Without knowing any specifics, I would caution against using a new language for a client project, since the goal is to build the best app that best fits the clients needs, and using a completely new language is probably going to give you unneeded headaches and not be the best code.<p>Just out of curiosity, what's the language your thinking about learning?",1340219016

If you're critical of McDonalds, you will assume that they photoshop and that they photoshop a lot. To combat such a misconception it is important to show how little you need to photoshop by showing ""all of it"".<p>But other than that, I agree with you. Well done, McDonalds.

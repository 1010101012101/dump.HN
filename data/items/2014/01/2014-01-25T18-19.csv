I had a colleague ask me about re-locating out of state the other day, and in the back of my mind, I was wondering if a solution like Double would be effective. I still find the concept kind of creepy, but it appears to have momentum, and when you get used to it ... it does seem practical.<p>I&#x27;m wondering if anyone in the HN community has had some extended time using one in an office setting, and can share their experience.",1390676362

Personally, as a male, the name doesn&#x27;t really bother me beyond the association of the term &#x27;brogrammer&#x27; with fratty programmers who drink a lot and don&#x27;t even code that well (and tbh, I think that alone should be a stereotype one would want to avoid). However, should we at least consider and discuss the implications of asking a female programmer to ask a &#x27;bro&#x27; for advice whenever she doesn&#x27;t know something?

Such a bug likely will not manifest until someone else writes completely unrelated code that uses the same variable name by coincidence.<p>Explicit declaration of the scope of a variable at initialization leads to unintended global namespace pollution when omitting the declaration is legal and causes the variable to be placed in the global scope, which can be difficult to diagnose because it is usually completely silent until unrelated code happens to interact by using the same name.<p>From a language design standpoint, this means that you should either require a declaration which determines scope (C or Java), or have local be the default for variables whose scope is undeclared (Python).<p>> I&#x27;ve never heard anyone ever complain about perl&#x27;s lexical &#x27;my&#x27;<p>That&#x27;s because programmers who care about good syntax in their languages don&#x27;t use Perl.",1390673816

It&#x27;s obvious you are not applying sound reasoning. Would you say it&#x27;s sound reasoning to convict a man cleared by DNA tests for murder when there are witness accounts from living people? Think about this maybe. You&#x27;re applying a wholly uneven standard of importance to one kind of evidence because of faith. And you resort to faith because the evidence is not good enough. You resort to faith because you want to. Given all that we know about the universe, you are clearly making the wrong choice.<p>I may not convince you, but again, you are exactly what I thought you were, a person who relies on faith to believe in God. Faith is a bad way to come to believe in things. For example Muslims believe Muhammad was the last prophet, Mormons believe Joseph Smith was a prophet. Both rely on faith, but clearly both can not be right. You would not use faith to answer questions in everyday life, because you would not do well.",1390672935

This is why some of us prefer Perl ;)<p><pre><code>    my $a = 1;\n    \n    my $contrived = sub {\n        my $a = 2; # new lexical variable $a\n        $a = 3; # if the my above wasn&#x27;t there, outer $a would be 3\n        ...\n    }\n\n    say $a; # 1\n</code></pre>\nExplicit declaration of the scope of a variable at initialisation is awesome. &#x27;global&#x27; and &#x27;nonlocal&#x27; feel weird/less consistent/like a workaround. People are used to creating variables &#x27;on the fly&#x27; in Python / CoffeeScript - both break (for a certain value of &#x27;break&#x27;) certain assumptions in certain circumstances.<p>I&#x27;ve never heard anyone ever complain about perl&#x27;s lexical &#x27;my&#x27;.. It even catches - with a warning - multiple my declarations that will clobber each other. You don&#x27;t see that in other languages that often.",1390672894

Users need to be very careful before blindly copy-pasting the &quot;example&quot; scripts into their shell. Hopefully the voting system will remedy this, but that&#x27;s not guaranteed.

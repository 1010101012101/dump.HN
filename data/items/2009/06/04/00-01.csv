When dealing with shared hosting of any sort (VPS included), it's a reasonable assumption that the host will stay fully on top of hardware issues, since you are not paying for a physical box.<p>If something craps out in one of my dedicated machines, I'll alert the host or NOC to have the fault looked into and fixed. If something craps out in a box hosting my home directory or VPS or what have you along with numerous others, I already expect that to be automatically detected and fixed within an acceptable timeframe. Ideally, in a VPS environment, my machine(s) should be migrated to a working box in the interim.",1244077084

640754,comment,636494,640097,0,0,jrogers,,,"@vaksel Correction, I was distinguishing the 335 from the X6, we are using the 335d. As for why not the 335i, The carbon footprint is worse than the 335d given that it is 30% less fuel efficient. We are focused on changing the impact of vehicles and this is a good way to start. If we were going to go for a gas system, we are prepared to offer the LS series engines. More hp by 430 vs 300. I hear you on the ""Performance, Reliability, Price...choose 2"" That has been true in the past, but we do not think that applies when you compare our product+experience to others product. LM is ""Design, Performance, Buildability, Price...choose 3 (green is a given)"". Our customers want great looking and great performance, and don't want to be keyed in the parking lot for driving something whose mpg is measured in gpm vice mpg. If someone wants to race and get more than the 425lb-ft from the 335d, then they have the room to swap to an LS7 and to crank it up.<p>As for road legal, you are thinking of passenger car specs, this vehicle would classify as a mixed use vehicle in which case many of the FMVSS specs to which you are referring would not be applicable. Hope that helps.<p>As for buggies and dirtbikes occupying the market...I guess I am just not going to be able to convince you and should not try. But here goes. ATVs and Bikes are a TOTALLY different experience which require a much more fit rider and mindset. Buggies are not anywhere near as capable as ""trucks"" made for this landscape (to be precise, we are talking about 25mph max vs 70mph avg.) Then there is the subject of Pre-running. Much of it today is done either in sand-rail/types or in sup'd up F-150/types. Most races (i.e. Reno to Vegas) are pre-run in a column of cars where you are simply eating dust the entire day. So sandrails are miserable, go ask John Marking of Fox Racing. As for sup'd up F-150 types after spending in excess of 150K you will have 10 inches of wheel travel and a 7000lb vehicle that needs a 700+ hp engine to move it, and it becomes a veritable space race of mass and power. The whole point is that no company has ever seen the profit in making cars for this size market, but LM makes cars with a much lower break-even volume allowing us to access a much smaller niche. Even if you are right and the market is not as large as we would want, we will have invested less than $2MM in the build program, so we can afford to scrap it and move on to the next ...compare this to Fisker or Tesla (other startup car co.'s) that have each raised in excess of $200MM and only have 1 model competing in very VERY busy marget segments.<p>As for MA, you are at Y-Combinator and should understand this. Just because we are starting in MA doesn't mean that we are finishing here. We are in a small startup Ops Center. We have 2 letters of intent on properties in Phoenix and are already working on our MA model. When we started we had no idea that the community would like the performance off-road desert racing segment, so we couldn't predict where would be best to go...so we dove in and got started. Hindsight is 20-20, but I prefer to get going. After all, this is unlike any start-up in any typical venture type market, so some of the nimble ideas do not apply as well. We are building a car company in an intensely difficult time and are taking risks where we feel appropriate and necessary and taking them large. Where we do not need to take risk, we are intensely conservative. I also hope that this helps.<p>Again, I am so stoked that you care enough to dig and to answer. I really think that our community could use your insight...hope you will join www.local-motors.com",1244076827
640753,comment,640692,640737,0,0,Shamiq,,,"Just to clear up, I am advocating zero-coupon convertibles.<p>Yes, you'll have to get the corporation to cover the cost of the shares. However, convertibles will give you a tax break since they go onto balance sheets as a liability, and so they effectively give you a ~35% discount.<p>The flip-side is that recipients will have to pay taxes on the implicit coupon payments. You really need to talk to a corporate accountant to get more details, and whether this is even a legal option for you, but definitely look into it.<p><i>EDIT</i><p>I misread your question. The payment becomes the responsibility of the issuing corporation, not the individual receiving the stock. That is a more clear answer :)",1244076823

640751,comment,640243,640657,0,0,seldo,,,"Abstraction is good, but I think the problem is that ORM is not a good abstraction for anything but the trivial case of a table. As soon as you want to do anything actually relational, I have yet to see an ORM layer that comes up with an efficient join.<p>The reason, say, C++ is a good abstraction for machine code is because it simplifies what's going on to the point that you can write something very complex in fewer lines of code, allowing it to fit into the human brain better. I'm willing to be shown examples to the contrary, but ORM layers don't simplify or compress relational queries, they just change the syntax to something more ""object-y"".<p>So maybe my point is that abstraction is good, but ORM isn't really abstraction.",1244076573

The purpose is generally to ensure that the bonds (as loan capital) have the tax offset-ability (against taxable profits) of loan interest, and perhaps pay gross to qualifying investors. At the same time, the ability to change the bonds into cumulative or non-cumulative preference capital should mean that they pose less balance sheet risk.

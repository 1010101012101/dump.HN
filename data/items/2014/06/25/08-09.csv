What is expensive with these computers is the fast interconnection buses between processors and modules, which is needed for many scientific problems that can&#x27;t easily be divided into independent subproblems.

OK, you say souped out network cards, and if you had said souped up switches as well, I could have given you some points, but this is the major cost of modern supercomputers.

7942853,comment,7941636,7941954,1,0,thisisparker,,,"Sorry, replying in two places on the same thread.<p>I&#x27;ve got no evidence that it was an actual DMCA notice, and the language suggesting it was an automated match seems much more likely to me.<p>That said, I don&#x27;t think I have any insider knowledge from my time there, but also wouldn&#x27;t want to give the impression that I was revealing non-public facts about their processes. It may be an abundance of caution, but it would certainly paint a target on the argument.<p>A major, major problem across many, many UGC sites is that, because the DMCA does not require them to forward takedown notices in their entirety affected users, there is information asymmetry at play. I filled out a dispute form on the site, which required consenting that my counter-notice would be forwarded on to the complaining party (if such a party exists).<p>If there is a DMCA notice, and if I can get it, and if I can show it was in bad faith, I&#x27;d absolutely raise the idea of pursuing a 512(f) claim against &quot;the assholes&quot; you mention. But 512(f) doesn&#x27;t work against what I wager happened, which is just a media partner engaging in copyfraud unbeknownst to SoundCloud.<p>If that&#x27;s what happened, SoundCloud likely has a contract saying that the media partner won&#x27;t do that, and could terminate their agreement or, who knows, sue over breach of contract. But I, the user, don&#x27;t have that course of action available to me.",1403685988

7942851,comment,7941757,7941757,1,0,semerda,,,"Half of the comparisons in the article are irrelevant, nit picking on stuff that isn&#x27;t important. However I do agree that Australia doesn&#x27;t have enough post seed money.. but Blackbird Ventures (and others) are changing that.<p>So I am an Aussie living in Silicon Valley for the past 5 years. Done 2 tech startups in AU and now in USA. Here is my take on the article based on my experience in both markets.<p>You don&#x27;t need an exit strategy. Stop focusing on exits overseas. Just build something people want!<p>It isn&#x27;t difficult to scale products worldwide from Australia. Infrastructure wise you now have AWS in Sydney, the best worldwide infrastructure platform (see Gartner’s Service Magic Quadrant). On the business front you only ever want to do an international strategy once you proved your product has a scalable business model. Same applies for US companies before they go global after Seed. While in the &quot;Seed&quot; phase use the local market to learn & iterate before scaling out.<p>5 years ago iTunes App store / Google Play did not exist. That sort of distribution is a door to the world! Not to mention the internet itself. Learn ASO, SEO and if you don&#x27;t have a mobile product.. then build one asap. The future is mobile. Humans are mobile creatures and we engage now more via that computer (mobile phone) in our pocket.<p>Look at WhatsApp. Based in Silicon Valley built an empire out of sight. They focused on an international market. By the time local competition noticed what a monster of a business it became, Facebook snapped them up for $19B.<p>I often hear business people that run tech companies complain more than software engineers about how hard it is to build companies without funding. As Chris Dixon pointed out at Startup School 2013, &quot;Business people vote with their dollars. Engineers vote with their time&quot;. Maybe it&#x27;s time to learn to code? If you can code you can build product now, iterate now etc.. without sitting around day dreaming ideas while waiting for &quot;funding&quot; so you can pay someone else to code it for you.. and potentially mess up the foundations.<p>Tax Breaks or Grants don&#x27;t matter. I have not heard any startup even consider those in the USA.<p>Australia is Expensive - have you seen the rentals in SF/bay area? Food and clothing - yeah dirt cheap in the USA compared to AU.<p>Timezones - West & East coast in the USA are 3 hours apart. If you need 24 hour support outsource it via oDesk.<p>Have you considered Health care? in the USA it is insanely expensive. If you don&#x27;t have a job you will pay around $1.7K for good coverage per month for your family (you, spouse & kid). If you don&#x27;t, you have no coverage. In Australia.. oh yeah it&#x27;s free. And not tied to your job. Now say you have employees. You should consider this a massive expense because if you don&#x27;t cover them, there are plenty of other companies that will with better benefits. You won&#x27;t have these issues/expenses or competition for talent in Australia.<p>When I left Australia few years ago there was no Fishburners (Sydney coworking space) or Startmate (YC like mentorship and seed financing) or a swarm of similar entities now all over Australia supporting local startups & talent. Yet people still built business. When I did my 1st tech startup straight out of University there wasn&#x27;t even enough free online content to tell me how to do stuff, no support networks and infrastructure cost an arm and a leg. If you ask me, I think it is far easier today to build a tech business in Australia then it was few years ago.",1403685934

But that certainly isn&#x27;t the normal case. If somebody is motivated to fund a company to be able to run things in a way they enjoy, they should be allowed to do so (of course there are limits, but liking to hang out with colleagues is not the limit).<p>Imagine you are hiring your first employee, ever. Is it really outrageous to want to hire somebody you get along with well (more than just &quot;being professional&quot;)? That person will be the only other human being you will be exposed to for a majority of your time. Maybe in a big open plan office with hundreds of employees those concerns are less important (among hundreds, you will find some likeminded souls). But not every company is that big.",1403685608

7942834,comment,7941636,7942275,2,0,thisisparker,,,"Hey there, OP here.<p>These are good questions, though I disagree with the characterization here. Like: I don&#x27;t think anybody&#x27;s <i></i>circumventing<i></i> the DMCA, so much as tacking on additional measures not required by law. Anybody who&#x27;s doing algorithmic enforcement, including YouTube and newly Vimeo, is in the same boat; in large part it&#x27;s the result of negotiations with media partners who demand it in exchange for access to content. So, they&#x27;re doing something separate from what the law requires (in addition to what the law requires) in order to satisfy partners... not really circumvention.<p>BUT it sucks. And it especially sucks when it&#x27;s done in a way that doesn&#x27;t respect users. And I&#x27;ve written about that lots, though not so much in this particular piece.<p>Sites have all kinds of &quot;guidelines&quot;, and some of them are offensive and others aren&#x27;t as much. Vimeo used to prohibit video gameplay uploads, for example; that&#x27;s probably not something I&#x27;d campaign on.<p>I probably should have put an extra sentence at the end to explain what I mean by the line you quoted, but I guess I didn&#x27;t think people would read it as &quot;bootlicking horseshit.&quot; In fact, I&#x27;m sorry to say I think you&#x27;ve read it exactly backwards.<p>I meant to emphasize: the issue is not my particular upload of Apollo 13 audio, which is obviously also available from a million other places. If you read the thing and think it&#x27;s about my complaining that this particular audio is taken down, that gives SoundCloud WAY too easy an out: they just comply with their own policies, maybe expedite the process for a (1) former employee who (2) works in copyright policy and (3) got the dispute to the top of Hacker News, and then they can wipe their hands of it.<p>No, making this issue about any one piece of content, my own included, misses the forest for the trees. I am mad, and I will stay mad even once SoundCloud&#x27;s reasonable employees doing their job flick a switch and reinstate my upload. I don&#x27;t want other people to feel like they can relax once my upload is back in place. It will be back in place, but what we need is systemic improvements to eradicate the creeping permissions culture.",1403685515

The less harmful of these are the ones who obviously are unqualified and clearly just spammed every job offer listed regardless of the requirements.  Since we aren&#x27;t talking about graduating seniors (see above) the majority of the not-obviously-unqualified often even have relevant work experience, but that&#x27;s just because it takes time for people to fire you.<p>I am talking about people with 2-5 years of experience working in language X who are barely able to (or sometimes even completely unable to) write FizzBuzz in language X.<p>Another example was someone with over 5 years of OS kernel development, who in the interview was unable to describe what exactly they did in those 5 years and they didn&#x27;t seem to know a much about any of the various OS topics we tried asking them about: scheduling, interrupts, DMA, filesystems, memory paging, IPC.<p>These people are particularly harmful, since there are very few tells at all on their resumes (and no reliable ones), you would have to interview all of them, which gets expensive.

7942759,comment,7940184,7942489,1,0,h1karu,,,"yeah I can&#x27;t say much about Pivotal labs aside from the unusual interview that I was a part of and the conclusions that I drew from that experience.  It&#x27;s certainly possible that I was imagining things but I strongly suspect they were poking and prodding to gauge my level of &quot;reactivity&quot; to various political statements.  I understand why they felt the need to make me jump through those hoops. They felt the need to try to filter out ahead of time those individuals who are likely to express strong or controversial opinions during the course of their total engagement with the company.  This makes sense because to run a pair-programming shop you have to try to build a community of relatively like-minded people who &quot;get along&quot; sort of like you&#x27;re running a college fraternity.  Polarizing issues/debates can lead to friction within these tight-knit fraternal organizations so it does make sense to try to weed out individuals who don&#x27;t already have an understanding about that, and how else could you do it if not by testing them ?<p>I&#x27;m not saying they did something untoward in their interviewing process I&#x27;m merely pointing out that this whole hidden layer of social filtering must out of necessity exist in pair-programming organizations in order to nip drama-potentials in the bud before they have a chance to come to fruition.  This is something that remote work shops simply don&#x27;t have to worry about which is a major strategic advantage currently misunderstood in the popular tech media space but extremely well understood by those who are actually running successful remote teams.<p>In other words because their core programming methodology (pair-programming) involves forcing individuals to share more casual interaction than what would normally occur in a traditional office environment organizations like Pivotal are forced to be proactive about filtering for &quot;casual social behavior traits&quot; in their never-ending struggle to  to maintain a harmonious drama-free zone.  This puts pair-programming shops at a distinct disadvantage when it comes to sourcing talent because<p>A. they&#x27;re drawing from a smaller talent pool, and<p>B. they have to care more about how the candidate behaves socially in casual &#x27;off the record&#x27; situations.<p>It&#x27;s my opinion that the added advantages which supposedly spring from  working at the same desk with another skilled individual are more than offset by these hidden constraints which the whole business is subjecting itself to.<p>I didn&#x27;t mean to imply that there&#x27;s &quot;emotional drama&quot; within Pivotal labs in particular, but I did mean to imply that remote shops don&#x27;t have to worry about that issue nearly as much as pair-programming shops because of the &quot;always on the record&quot; nature of modern group collaboration infrastructure.<p>I would also like to point out that the true 10x developers out there are statistically more often the personality types who are likely to express controversial opinions or touch on polarizing issues.  This has been a truism throughout recorded human history when it comes to extremely brilliant individuals.<p><a href=""http://37signals.com/remote"" rel=""nofollow"">http://37signals.com/remote</a>\n< recommended reading even for pair-programming die-hards<p>(I&#x27;m not connected with the author of that book in any way)",1403683611

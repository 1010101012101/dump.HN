What always amazes me is that even after all those years when I kick myself in gear and get it over with it usually is less than an hour, two at the most to get that molehill-that-became-a-mountain out of the way.<p>This is a very annoying character trait and I do everything I can to get it out of my life, including the tricks I outlined above. The golden rule seems to be don't make promises you can't keep. Treat those statements about what you are going to do exactly like you would treat a solemn promise.<p>Sometimes it's stronger, sometimes it is less, but on the whole this is really a bad element in my character and it takes a lot of effort to get (and keep) it under control.<p>I am not sure if I'll ever be free of this particular demon but I'm definitely going to continue to work on it.<p>Just one example to show you how bad this can get. I do some contracting and had to move a bunch of tickets over from one ticketing system to another. Not rocket science, simply take one database, do a format conversion and import into another.<p>All told it was less than 4 hours of work. But it took me 4 days, and I finally did exactly what I said above, I mailed all the users of the old system that their new system would be up later today.<p>That sort of clinched it for me, now there was no backing out. Several hours later, job done, users active on the new system.

943456,comment,943356,943356,0,0,pnorvig,,,"A revised web site should be up shortly, detailing what's new.  Here's what the preface says:<p>This edition captures the changes in AI that have taken place since                         
the last edition in 2003.  There have been important applications of                                  
AI technology, such as the widespread deployment of practical speech                                  
recognition, machine translation, autonomous vehicles, and household                                  
robotics.  There have been algorithmic landmarks, such as the solution                                
of the game of checkers. And there has been a great deal of                                           
theoretical progress, particularly in areas such as probabilistic                                     
reasoning, machine learning, and computer vision. Most important                                      
from our point of view is the continued evolution in how we think about the field, and thus how we    
organize the book. The major changes are as follows:                                                  
\begin{itemize}                                                                                       
\item We place more emphasis on partially observable and nondeterministic                             
environments, especially in the nonprobabilistic settings of search                                   
and planning. The concepts of {\em belief state} (a set of possible                                   
worlds) and {\em state estimation} (maintaining the belief state)                                     
are introduced in these settings; later in the book, we add probabilities.                            
\item In addition to discussing the types of environments and types of agents,                        
we now cover in more depth the types of {\em representations} that an agent can use.                  
We distinguish among {\em atomic} representations (in which each state of the                         
world is treated as a black box), {\em factored} representations (in which a state is                 
a set of attribute/value pairs), and {\em structured} representations (in which the world             
consists of objects and relations between them).                                                      
\item Our coverage of planning goes into more depth on contingent planning in partially observable    
environments and includes a new approach to hierarchical planning.                                    
\item We have added new material on first-order probabilistic models,                                 
including {\em open-universe} models for cases where there is                                         
uncertainty as to what objects exist.                                                                 
\item We have completely rewritten the introductory machine-learning chapter, stressing a wider varie\
ty                                                                                                    
of more modern learning algorithms and placing them on a firmer theoretical footing.                  
\item We have expanded coverage of Web search and information                                         
extraction, and of techniques for learning from very large data sets.                                 
\item 20\% of the citations in this edition are to works published after                              
2003.                                                                                                 
\item We estimate that about 20\%                                                                     
of the material is brand new. The remaining 80\% reflects older work but has been largely             
rewritten to present a more unified picture of the field.

I have been playing piano, banjo, and several other instruments on a fairly regular basis for around 15 years now.  If that doesn't make me ""aware of my fingers,"" I'm not sure what would.<p>I don't see why having to press a key down slightly farther is necessarily a problem.  If your forearms and wrists are in a comfortable position, it doesn't much matter how far your fingers have to move.  In fact, I tend to think that a bit more movement is actually helpful with circulation.<p>You're entitled to your opinion of the keyboard, but I think it was just downright rude to say that the keyboard was designed for unaware sheeple like me.",1258324157

Clearly what they mean is that if you are going to run a commercial server (with the attendant increase in outgoing traffic), you should buy a business account.  But that is not what is stated in the contract.  As it stands, the Verizon FIOS contract disallows running sshd and logging in to your own computer from outside your home network.  Now, they don't block this, and won't, yet the contract language disallows such a personal and reasonable use.<p>I have tried writing to Verizon, politicians, the FCC, and the BBB on this issue.

And you can end up with exponential slowdowns due to thread migration. The best strategy is to pin parts of the thread ring on each core.<p>Go doesn't have a good SMP scheduler, so you see that slowdown, and the GHC team have written about the solutions.

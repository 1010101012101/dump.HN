6194949,comment,6194764,6194764,22,0,hqsavvy,,,"I ran a consulting business in Ontario Canada from 1999-2004
Today the provincial sales tax is included (harmonized) with the federal sales tax as the HST (8% + 5% = 13%) but
back then they were charge separately as PST and GST. Each tax act treated software and software services differently.<p>When we started we were compatriots with many such contractors in the city. They said, confirmed by our accountant, that our services were not PST eligible so we collected and submitted only the federal GST. This we did for 5 years without any incident; like an audit from the province.<p>In 2004 our business failed and we were in the process of closing up shop when the feds audited our GST history and found that
in 2001-2004 our GST submissions were off and we owed about 30k incl interest and files. We made arrangements to pay the bill. 
Painful but under control.<p>But, the federal audit triggered a provincial audit and that&#x27;s when we discovered that the rules for PST regarding software/it services had changed during our run, making the work we did subject to the 8% PST. The rules for that are eerily similar to those described in the OP.<p>The provincial government determined that the changes to The Act were retroactive and covered all the business we ever did and that with interest and penalties we owed over 700k payable by the end of that week or they would take action. 
The company was broke so he action we were threatened with was that, as officers of the company, we were personally liable for the amount and that if not paid by the end of the week, our personal bank accounts would be frozen. This was not good.<p>Further we found out that at that time, these rules were only enforced when a PST audit occurred. So, when we told the many contractor pals in town that this could be a problem for them. a) they didn&#x27;t believe it, and b) AFIK none of them changed their practice of collecting only the GST.<p>Anyways, there was a loophole where a customer could assume the liability for the PST by giving us a waiver form. Luckily the majority of our work was with one customer, a huge corp, who agreed to do this and we were off the hook.<p>It was a very stressful week.<p>PS. I have not done any consulting since 2004 so I am not aware of any subsequent changes to The Act. AFIK, none of the contractors I know were dinged the way we were. I figure that harmonization of the taxes means they are collecting tax for both govt entities now.",1376229300

It&#x27;s not that the intellectual property moves over (because government can&#x27;t own a copyright) but that the people do. There are a number of cases where a researcher in the public sector discovered something and, instead of putting it into the public domain (where it belongs, since the government paid for it) he went to work for a pharma company on a 500k+ salary, which is essentially a finder&#x27;s fee for IP worth $100M++ to the company.<p>I don&#x27;t know that this can be solved completely, but I think that (yes, I am going to advocate for more government spending) salaries should be raised to be comparable with, at least, the industry average in the private sector. (Obviously, government can&#x27;t match the private-sector high-end.)<p>I agree with the general insight of the article.<p>Now, there&#x27;s a second-order effect that is poorly understood but extremely important. Startups were more innovative in the 1970s than now. Why? Bell Labs and Xerox PARC were in their heyday. The public sector paid only slightly less (10-20%) than private. Academia wasn&#x27;t the jobless shithole it is today. To get people to leave their jobs in basic research, companies had to compete on autonomy and interesting work. The result was that, even to get in the game, people had to come up with more interesting and better companies.<p>The general lack of autonomy for technical people in 2013 is why the Zyngas exist today. There really isn&#x27;t that competition. Sure, the large tech companies offer free lunches and one massage per year, but the work is usually so managed and uninspiring that they aren&#x27;t putting up much of a fight.<p>Doubling down on high-autonomy, basic research work, no matter who does it, government or private, is good for society.

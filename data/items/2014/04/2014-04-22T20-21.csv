7630405,comment,7627706,7629665,1,0,minimax,,,"What I meant to imply was that the emergence of fractional dollar tick sizes was probably due to the fact that they were easier to deal with before the advent of computerized execution, clearing, and settlement. By the mid nineties most of that had been automated and there was therefore no good reason for such large tick sizes. When humans were still doing all trade processing manually, it made sense to have a system that incentivized fewer large trades (vs more smaller trades). Large minimum price variations and round lot requirements would have been a means to that end.",1398200351

I&#x27;d guess that with this type of sensor you could use the lens wide open but not be limited to a very narrow focal depth. This could allow you to take shots in low light that you wouldn&#x27;t normally be able to get. Macro photography also has problems with focusing. You might be able to put a macro lens on here and take one picture completely in focus instead of combining a series of shots in photoshop.",1398199296

Why is it not just, well, &quot;automated&quot;, without me here as an &quot;observer&quot;?<p>It&#x27;s simple really: you have to observe to decide. Imagine not having any vision-qualia. How would you read? Your vision-qualia is the substrate from which your conscious mind makes decisions. You cannot have conscious decision making without qualia. Conscious experience is simply high level representations of information interfacing with your decision-making apparatus. Nothing more, nothing less.<p>The concept of p-zombies are inherently contradictory. P-zombies are by definition indistinguishable from a conscious entity through any test. Yet when I ask a p-zombie a million questions designed to get at its conception of its conscious experience, it responds in the exact same way as the conscious entity. Furthermore, all observations of its behavior prove to be equivalent to the conscious entity. So the p-zombie must contain the exact same information regarding &quot;conscious experience&quot; as the assumed conscious entity. Therefore, the two systems are information-equivalent.<p>What is the difference between these two supposed systems? They are information-equivalent, and yet you claim the conscious entity experiences something the p-zombie doesn&#x27;t. But of course, by definition of experience, that occurrence must be able to shape your future behavior. This contradicts information-equivalence.<p>You might say: well the representation of that information is different in the p-zombie vs the conscious entity. This doesn&#x27;t work either. Just like the universe has no privileged reference-frame, it has no privileged information representation either.<p>Therefore, either qualia is a meaningless concept, or it is purely dependent on information representation.<p>Furthermore, if you accept that our brains are a large part of what makes up our minds, then somehow our physical brains &quot;interface&quot; with the substrate of consciousness. Neuroscientists should be able to find this interface. Physicists should be able to probe this &quot;consciousness substrate&quot; using the same physical properties of matter that our brains do. We have found nothing of the sort. The only thing in our brains are bundles of neurons and neurotransmitters. Those of you that suppose metaphysical explanations for consciousness are just as guilty of &quot;god of the gaps&quot; as those who would look up at the stars and posit a god holding them in place.

It was a ton of money.  As Wikipedia points out, &quot;The first funding for Google as a company was secured in August 1998 in the form of a US$100,000 contribution from Andy Bechtolsheim, co-founder of Sun Microsystems, given to a corporation which did not yet exist.&quot;  They used that to raise &quot;On June 7, 1999, a round of equity funding totalling $25 million&quot;, about 10 months later.  Pop quiz.  Which was more money, the $100K in the first context or the $25M in the second?

However, that&#x27;s not going to be of much help when the kids you&#x27;re photographing don&#x27;t know the sport. Expect a comparatively large number of failed shots, and learn to laugh.

When I stream MP3 content via HTTPS &c., &c., I always get smooth playback for as long as I care to use it, and all my other home services work fine.<p>Of further note: All the locations from which I&#x27;ve observed this problem offer sufficient downstream bandwidth to support streaming of 320Kbps CBR MP3 files, as indicated both by the fact that doing so over HTTPS works fine, and that streaming FLAC at much higher bitrates also works fine. I used to stream MP3 (but not FLAC) over Verizon DSL, which had barely enough upstream bandwidth to support it (and not enough for FLAC), and never had this sort of problem. The only variables in the admittedly informal tests I&#x27;ve run have been transport encryption and content encoding; in particular, all the content, regardless of format, comes from the same hardware, through the same HTTP server, across the same path through my local network.<p>I suppose these observations might plausibly lead to some conclusion other than the one I&#x27;ve drawn, but I don&#x27;t see how; if you do, I&#x27;d like to hear about it.",1398196830

I do think I have a problem with the prestige aspect. I am always wavering between two different feelings: &quot;I need to make the biggest difference I can,&quot; and, &quot;My happiness should not depend on my work&#x27;s importance.&quot; These feelings aren&#x27;t mutually exclusive, but a lot of the time, I either feel one way, or I feel the other. It&#x27;d be more comfortable to just choose one and stick with it.<p>Was it a tough call when you decided to go to graduate school? It seems like it&#x27;s always such a huge decision, no matter your circumstances. Also, how would you have been more selective in projects? Did you get stuck on a particular project?

Looking at any one example of a Javascript build script I find references to dozens of other tools all of which needs to be pulled down with the current FOTM package manager... It feels like a collection of russian dolls just trying to get my head around it. Just as an example here is the first build script I found navigating from the Gulp site:<p>https://github.com/gulpjs/gulp/blob/master/docs/recipes/browserify-uglify-sourcemap.md<p>So. Many. Moving. Parts. It&#x27;s not normal for a toolchain to be this complicated. Do you think it&#x27;s getting out of hand?

When I hear this, I think, &quot;If I&#x27;m not as passionate as Feynman, I should not go to grad school.&quot; And so I haven&#x27;t. Am I looking at this the wrong way? When I compare the subjects I enjoy and the careers that allow freedom and decent pay, physics seems to be the only thing that remains. Is that not enough? I don&#x27;t have the confidence to know whether I&#x27;ll love the subject in ten years. I also think anyone who has that confidence is either a Feynman-type or has deluded themselves. Regarding (2), don&#x27;t most hard science grad programs pay the students?<p>I&#x27;m also not saying that computational physicists are more employable than common programmers (or that they&#x27;re better software developers!). I&#x27;m just saying I enjoy working on problems similar to those encountered in computational physics. I enjoy figuring out how things work and modelling them. In case I ended up hating physics by the end of graduate school, at least I&#x27;d have a strong background in mathematics and programming, and those skills could be transferred to domains with similar problems.<p>If you don&#x27;t mind me asking, are you still working in physics? Based on your &quot;about&quot; section, you seem to be interested in a great many things, like myself. Before entering graduate school, could you truly not think of doing anything else, i.e., did you truly obey criterion (1)? I can think of many things I&#x27;d still like to do while I&#x27;m young: start a business, write songs professionally, act... but it&#x27;s hard to take risks like that when you&#x27;ve got a good (and more practical) thing going.",1417764097

Whenever someone becomes successful we hear the same story across all industries: ""started with nothing, worked 100 hours a week, etc..."". Sadly enough 1 in hundreds is an exception and not a rule. What you do not hear about is how bad it is for the ones who did not moderate their input (physical, emotional, financial). Subsequently years later market crashes, housing bubbles, increase in divorces etc...make the news. What is the source of these  problems? Lack of moderation.",1235667595

This study just shows that four attempted diets, none of them particularly sophisticated, all work equally well - which is to say, not very.<p>Yes, the laws of thermodynamics hold, but what if, oh, say, <i>what</i> you ate had an influence on <i>how much</i> you felt impelled to eat?  Or how energetic you felt and how much you moved around?  If your fat cells are rapidly absorbing what's in your bloodstream, you'll feel hungry and eat more, and you'll feel tired and move less.<p>The number one experimental result of dieting is that 95% of the people gain back the weight a few years later.<p>If Seth Roberts is right, all we're seeing from this study is a temporary bump that results from changing your food habits in <i>any</i> direction, which leaves behind the old flavor-calorie association, which makes you less hungry.  And if they stick to this diet a while, they'll develop new flavor-calorie associations and gain back the weight.  (This is a very elegant theory which, among other experimental support, explains a lot of the chaos in dietary science; almost any dietary change makes you lose weight, but only temporarily.)<p>Sorry, metabolisms are just more complicated than this.

Anyone who has ever actually seriously lost weight and kept it off knows that everything comes to the bottom line: calories consumed vs. calories expended.<p>Formula for HN: ((calories consumed - calories expended) / 3500) = weight change in LBS of fat.

The thing I always hate about writing is that I'm constantly saving copies off to the side. At the very least I would think snapshots would be invaluable, but once you have playback, you basically already have snapshots with high granularity.<p>While solutions like DropBox or Sharepoint allow versioning and collaboration it's at a higher level.

A part of that I dump into cash in my pocket for beer and sushi and whatever doesn't accept credit cards, and the rest I set aside to pay off the month's credit card bill.<p>The effect of this is that I have to keep a running ballpark tally of how much I have left in the credit card pile, and since I've conditioned myself to be deathly afraid of going over, I always estimate conservatively, and I inevitably wind up with a surplus that I dump straight into savings and never touch again.<p>Why a credit card instead of a check card?  Because the credit card company pays me that 2% for free, because if it gets stolen it's the credit card's money at risk and not mine, because if an emergency happens I have the flexibility to break my rules, because it establishes a credit score that I can parlay into lower interest rates when I want to buy a car or a house later.<p>I think the advice to not have a credit card is pretty terrible, actually.  There are so many benefits, and as long as you have a little self-control, pretty much no downside.",1235667294

There's another problem. YAML is so simple, you don't need to read the damn manual for it. That example already taught you 80%. Ok, the easy 80%. But if you come from the Java (and XML) world, reading the manual is what you do just to get started.",1235665461
495995,comment,475329,476235,0,0,thenduks,,,"You're right that `sort{rand}` is a bad idea, but not because it could run forever. `rand` in Ruby just returns a number like 0.9307038377384, used in sorting this will just always sort the same way (since it's always > 0). So Ruby will use the result of `rand` to determine if one element should be sorted before or after another. So maybe a better solution would be to use `sort{rand - 0.5}` or something, so that it will randomly be either < or > 0.<p>I was curious so I looked Array#rand in the Active Support source code[1], the implementation uses the following code to get a random element:<p><pre><code>    def rand
      self[Kernel.rand(length)]
    end
</code></pre>
So, this is much better than sorting the whole array in random order and pulling one off the top :) But it still uses `rand`.<p>[1] <a href=""http://github.com/rails/rails/tree/e56b3e4c0b60b2b86f5ca9c5e5a0b22fa34d37ab/activesupport"" rel=""nofollow"">http://github.com/rails/rails/tree/e56b3e4c0b60b2b86f5ca9c5e...</a>",1235665406

495984,comment,495932,495932,0,0,smoody,,,"I agree with that. I used to be extremely paranoid. Now, less so. But I did have an experience once that reinforced my paranoia: A local prominent business woman visited first startup under the pretense of being a potential investor (which gives her an automatic out -- investors don't sign NDAs). She watched my demo, took lots of notes, asked lots of questions, left, and then called me three weeks later to invite me to breakfast at some fancy private club. I show up (she's wearing some sort of see-through shirt which freaked me out a bit -- I was suddenly worried she was going to try to seduce me) and then, with a straight face, told me: ""I have complete notes about what your product is, the direction you're taking, and your business model. I also have a team of great engineers who recently left Sun who ready to start coding tomorrow if I give them the go-ahead. Unless you hire me as your CEO immediately, I will steal your idea, launch a public campaign to discredit you, and make sure you never work in this industry again.""<p>I laughed because I was sure she was kidding. Turns out she wasn't. I politely declined her offer and walked out the door. She told me I'm making the biggest mistake of my life. I probably spent the next two months being in such a paranoid state that I was pretty much useless as a contributor. It turns out she never did follow through on her threats. But I learned then that even someone with the worst of intentions can't necessarily take someone else's idea and turn it into a reality. That's when I started to relax a bit when it comes to NDAs. But, that said, I still ask contractor programmers to sign them but what I ask them to sign is so amazingly simple that it's more an agreement to respect each other's ideas.",1235665031

495974,comment,495053,495053,0,0,twopoint718,,,"I've been toying with the idea of adapting the Elo rating system from chess to a social site's user score. The basic idea from chess is that you assume someone has an intrinsic <i>skill</i> in some arbitrary units (I think you start out around 1,000 and a 2400+ is senior master) and that we can only <i>infer</i> that skill from how they perform in tournaments. Furthermore, your skill in any particular game is assumed to be normally distributed about that intrinsic skill value. It is also assumed that your skill will only change slowly over time (we don't have to pin down a moving target).<p>So the mechanics of this system are basically that when you compete with someone that is much better than you and win your score should be adjusted upwards. Conversely, if you lose to someone worse than you, your score will be adjusted downward. Adjustments are done in batches, say after a player has finished a tournament (I use five voting events between readjustment).<p>My application to a user karma system would be analogous in that a ""match"" or ""competition"" would happen every time someone directly rates someone else (stories may be exempt). A high-karma user upvoting a low-karma user would increase the low-karma user's karma and decrease the high-karma user's karma. If there are two users with equal karma and one up or downvotes the other. the number of points exchanged will be minimal (the gain/loss scales with the difference in karma).<p>The idea is that your ideas are competing with the opinions of the high-ranked users. The assumption is that new users will have bad ideas and that high-karma users will downvote them. A downvote from a high-karma user is expected and doesn't cost the new user very much (they are expected to ""lose"" to them often).<p>I've sketched out some of the functions here:

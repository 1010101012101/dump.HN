If you are trying to do queries in LDAP and all of the data (entry db and index dbs) do not fit in RAM, then forget about it. This is why you would design the system to take growth into account. Modern LDAP servers -- in conjunction with LDAP proxy servers -- are designed to do this very thing. Verison has their 75 million wireless subscriber ""database"" in LDAP, not a RDBMS, and the entire dataset is in memory (spread across dozens of servers).",1237002989

It starts off as fairly negligible but eventually becomes a huge monkey on your back.  An auto-layout feature can alleviate that, but then you've got to keep track of where everything is.<p>Some people seem to be immune to this, so I guess the proportion of people effected (along with the average size of a logical unit in the language - function, module, program, etc) might in turn effects the potential of a visual language to get mindshare.<p>Talking to a number of people who've used / written / studied them about this problem over a couple of beers the best solution we've come up with is to have a visual language for beginners and a textual dataflow language for the more advanced users, and the ability to convert between the two for the people making the transition.<p>Thoughts?",1237002601

Here is one of the poems from the Amazon reviews:<p>Deformed Finger<p><pre><code>  Don't stick your finger in the ketchup bottle,
  Mother said. It might get stuck, &
  then you'll have to wait for your father
  to get home to pull it out. He
  won't be happy to find a dirty fingernail
  squirming in the ketchup that he's going to use
  on his hamburger.  He'll yank it out so hard
  that for the rest of your life you won't
  be able to wear a ring on that finger.
  And if you ever get a girlfriend, &
  you hold hands, she's bound to ask you
  why one of your fingers is deformed,
  & you'll be obligated to tell her how
  you didn't listen to your mother, &
  insisted on playing with the ketchup bottle,
  & she'll get to thinking, he probably won't
  listen to me either, & she'll push your hand away.</code></pre>",1237001024

If your product is Amazon S3, they're great customers to have.  If your product solves business problems for bakers, <i>not so much</i>.<p>The people who benefit most from Techcrunch are the startups where the company is the product, because ""We got 100,000 users!"" (who don't pay us money) and ""We got on Techcrunch!"" (who don't care about us) sound impressive when you're trying to sell that sort of product.",1237000816

That repels me immensely.<p>Part of the reason I got out of working in companies is that I got the sense that there's a separate caste for technical people... where it's impossible to be taken seriously as someone who can do anything but implement what other people think up.<p>On a slight tangent, the reason I slightly regret putting myself into a technical career path in school is that, for technical people, it's harder to move up in an organization and almost impossible to move laterally. Because even if you have multiple talents, you'll never get a chance to prove them.<p>There are non-technical, businessesy people that I have immense respect for. But it bugs me when I'm speaking to new, young entrepreneurs that have this attitude of entitlement, like they should be commanding other people and driving the vision.<p>I applaud them for extending the YC model outside of YC. And I love the idea of matching founders up. But their attitude seems to give a nod to this notion that technical ability and business skills are mutually exclusive. I find it insulting that if you're in any way technical, you're only supposed to apply for the proletariat slot.",1237000327

""<p>The analogies are flawed.<p>""Novel idea"" in CS divorced from implementation would be like a non-playing musician coming up with ""cool musical ideas "".<p>""I have this cool idea for a new musical genre but I am not interested in the actual playing of  music""  or ""I have this cool idea for a novel  but I don't want to sit down and type it up/ write it down"". How much of a musician or writer would someone making such statements be? ""Novelty"" has to be made concrete by playing/writing/programming. It is <i>in the process</i> of writing/playing/programming that you discover if the ""novel"" idea makes any sense at all.<p>you say ""I'm using implementation in a general way to not only include programming but also clever algorithm design, better software engineering practices, etc.""<p>Ok if all those are ""implementation""  what's left? someone coming up with ""cool ideas""?<p>""as you get older, you will find it easier to come up with novel applications and harder to come up with quality implementations""<p>Speak for yourself friend! I for one would be very leery of someone who has ""cool ideas"" but can't/won't implement them.<p>I encounter MBAs with this attitude every day.

Seems unlikely to me.<p>Double blind experiments do show causation (ignoring metaphysical discussions).<p>There are 3 possibilities: Chemical -> Behavior, Behavior -> Chemical, or ??? -> (Chemical and behavior).<p>A randomized trial eliminates the latter two possibilities (since chemical is correlated only to a coin flip). Double blind eliminates experimenter bias.",1201636799
106347,story,,,18,10,henning,"""I'd just use an n-by-k array of closures to represent this.""",,"Paul Graham has claimed quite a few times that OOP isn't very significant. From http://www.paulgraham.com/pfaq.html: ""A lot of what seem to be OO problems turn out not to be if you have random access to the concepts that together comprise object-orientedness. If I were writing a CAD program or a simulation, for example, I'd probably use OO abstractions (though I'd probably end up creating my own OO model with macros instead of using whatever came with the language).""<p>I wonder, if you had 5 different Paul Grahams working on different subsystems of the same project, if they'd each create 5 different mutually incompatible object models, with no code reuse between them. How about performance? The CLR and the JVM use a lot of techniques to make method dispatch efficient; why reinvent the wheel if you need performance?<p>In the particular case of a serial port protocol, I could easily see how the protocol could involve keeping track of state, in which case an object would be extremely convenient. Stuffing all that into a single closure could easily become awkward; what you want is a way to manage state and behavior <i>together</i>, which is exactly what an object does.<p>Yes, objects matter more if you don't closures, because then you can simulate them using the so-called strategy pattern. But nevertheless both closures and objects are something I use frequently based on what reads easier and is easier to express.<p>I say this as someone who <i>has</i> used Lisp, who programs with map, filter, and fold all day long, and so on. I like Lisp, and also I think objects are a good idea. If you actually are working with real-world things, the ability to create a domain-model is a wonderful resource. Having a language as powerful as CLOS to work with is a blessing and I think that should be recognized, that's all.",1201636618

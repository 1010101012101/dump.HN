Just @define to define and @symbol to expand.<p>But of course it's just a point of view like many things in design. I wanted to share my view about this because I planned to write the interpreter for this stuff and write a blog entry. Thanks for your article I'm happy it makes sense for others to extend in some way the CSS in order to have some kind of symbols.<p>CSS gurus and standard fundamentalists will usually reply that with inheritance you should never need this kind of stuff, but they lies ;)",1180432632

They tend to indicate someone believes their words are too valuable to demean them with a mere website...and folks who think that way are generally blow-hards.  I think I'd rather catch up on Particle Tree articles than read the suggested PDFs (because it's a great resource...but I think this post is off the mark).",1180432497
25163,comment,25135,25162,0,0,pc,,,"The are a few problems with this approach. First, it takes more work. Second, it makes it harder to share values between CSS files. (Of course, you could add an @include statement to the ""CSS++"" language -- but that's starting to get pretty heavyweight.) Lastly, having yet another language is kinda unnecessary and confusing, as compared to just integrating ordinary Ruby expressions.",1180432274
25162,comment,25135,25135,0,0,antirez,,,"Don't like this design binding CSS stuff and application vars, I could use as alternative a function that gets a CSS++ and turns it into a CSS, so that the CSS remains self contained. Something like this:<p>@define companyred #ff5000<p>@define warningborder border: 1px red dotted<p>h1 {<p>     color: @companyred;<p>}
 
 ....<p>So that the CSS file makes sense by itself.",1180431889
25161,comment,25143,25143,0,0,antirez,,,"Well... depends, my startup is around position 20 in this listing about unique visitors / month but still I'm not rich ;) It is probably related to the nature of the deal we did and the fact our user base is in Italy, but what I mean is that if you don't get acquired and your business model is advertising 1,5 million unique visitors per month in a reddit-alike site will not make you rich most of the times.<p>For example assuming 5$ every 1000 impression, with an average of 3 impressions for unique user with 1 million  of unique visitors a month you get from adsense 15k$. If there are two founders and bandwidth to pay this means you are making just about to survive.<p>In this web 2.0 bubble we are living this days I see very few news/technological sites where the business model is advertising and they are really profitable, or I'm missing something? Advertising tends to work only in services where your user base is the average john smith with IE6 clicking everywhere there is a banner. With smart users it gets very hard.<p>I'm not as experienced as many founders following news.yc but I suggest that if you plan to start a startup you should <i></i>try hard<i></i> to get an idea where there is a different business model than advertising, like PRO accounts or things like where there  is a straight line binding user satisfaction with your earnings. In our new service we are trying this new model, even if this is also very hard indeed being the world full of free-everything-web-services :)",1180430720

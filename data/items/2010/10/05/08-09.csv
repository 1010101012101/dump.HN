1759050,comment,1757716,1758791,0,0,swombat,,,"Of course there is no ""real value"". However, inflation is not solely the result of the government's wishes to inflate the currency (as examples of hyper-inflation obviously show).<p>Inflation is also simply in the minds of the people using the currency. If everyone expects high inflation, and keeps raising their prices to match their expectation of inflation, then inflation <i>will</i> happen - the raising of prices will ensure that. And if you try to fix that by force, as you pointed out, the inflation accelerates even more, because it's now happening in a black market with even more waste.<p>The way they fixed inflation in Brazil was, it appears, by changing people's expectation of what should happen to currency. They had to get everyone to believe that the brazilian currency can be stable. The mechanism they used to do that was the cheap trick of creating an alternative currency and calling it ""real"". It may be a cheap trick, but from the look of it, it worked.",1286268798

See the final paragraph of this reply).<p><pre><code>  Fowler's DSL book just came out; by definition you simply \n  can't place it in the same class as the Dragon book.\n</code></pre>\nI didn't place it in 'the same class': I suggested Fowler's book <i>plus</i> the ANTLR reference have many interesting, relevant, even necessary, things to say about the subject of writing DSL's that aren't in SICP (but again: see the final paragraph of this reply), like the Dragon book has many interesting, relevant and necessary things to say about compilers that aren't in SICP.<p><pre><code>  After that, it becomes apparent that the phrase ""Domain\n  Specific Language"" is really just unnecessary terminology.\n</code></pre>\nYou didn't originally get that just from chapter 4 of SICP. You have much, <i>much</i> more knowledge of all kinds of things relevant to writing DSL's that you didn't learn from chapter 4 of SICP. That it may all be implied in that chapter does not mean it is a useful resource for someone touching the subject of DSL's for the first time, because they won't grasp the implications. Implications may be clear <i>in hindsight</i>, when you apply all your other knowledge to that chapter, but that doesn't mean they were even remotely clear to you in the first place.<p><pre><code>  If you actually grok Chapter 4 then you grok Lisp\n</code></pre>\nAnd you won't grok that chapter until long after you have acquired a vast array of secondary, additional, related knowledge on the subjects the chapter touches upon.<p>SICP is like a deep philosophical work: you need to study philosophy and read a lot of primary and secondary works to truly understand it's references and implications.

The auditorium was full, as a lot of the students had opinions about the US involvement in Afghanistan, and mostly negative ones, so there was much curiosity about what an ""official"" would say about it to such an audience. The embassy representative arrived, had a long talk about how much work it was to get his job, and how cool it was to travel to Europe and  live here, and then stated the purpose of his visit was to show us how beautiful the US is. He then proceeded to slow hundreds of slides of landscape/sunset/nature photos. After all this, he evaded the inevitable request for commentary on the war by stating he had run out of time. This is sort of the feeling I get from this article. It's a travel guide look at silicon valley, but doesn't have any depth or insight about the actual effect SV has on startups. This is a great guide for people who live in the region and want to play tourist for a day. But how many of those don't know these things?",1286265786

Somehow it&#x27;s a skill that&#x27;s way undervalued here, compared to e.g. middle-management. That said, a senior dev with an academic background (ie: if you can do more than just programming but also have the background to acquire and use complex domain-specific knowledge) you can easily make over $6000 gross a month. The cost of hiring you will be almost double that for the employer.<p>You&#x27;re not going to make that kind of money by working projects for a consultancy firm though, the margins they are making on your skills are ridiculous.",1446026376

The dealer franchise system and its legal framework have evolved over 100 years and are balanced pretty delicately.  It can&#x27;t just be refactored by waving a regulatory wand at it and hoping for the best.  Cars will still have to be warehoused, delivered, serviced, and resold.  Somebody has to buy your old junky trade-in.  Somebody has to run the showroom, if you want to actually like see the car before you buy it.  So we&#x27;re going to do a regulatory taking of the franchise, worth millions of dollars per dealership, and then have the manufacturer open a showroom and warehousing lot and service center in every town and city that has a dealership?

10463412,comment,10463195,10463195,0,0,osullivj,,,"This is true of outsourcing generally, not just outsourcing to lower cost offshore regions. Back in 2000 I left my secure dev job with a large US bank to join a startup and chase the dotcom boom with a startup. The crash happened, I got laid off, no one was hiring, so I ended up joining a boutique &#x27;consultancy&#x27; doing dev for banks. Over the course of the next three years I learnt a brutal lesson in the consultancy development business model. As this post points out, there&#x27;s a fundamental misalignment of interests. The client wants the project done, and the consultant resources gone. The consulting firm wants maximum headcount on the project for maximum duration, and therefore maximum billing. This misalignment means the consulting firm can&#x27;t speak the truth to the client. The consulting firm can&#x27;t speak the truth to their employees either, and will usually give them some flim flam about how consultancy is the best of all possible worlds as it combines the security of permanent employment with the variety of contracting. In fact it combines the worst of both - the insecurity of contracting with the lower pay of permie work. Consultancy firms run on one key benchmark - utilisation level. Most, like ThoughtWorks or IBM Global Services, will aim for 65 to 70%. That means 65-70% of employee hours must be billable to a client. If you drop below that rate you have to fire people. At the &#x27;boutique&#x27; consultancy I worked for they ran at 95%. Folk would roll off a client assignment at 5pm on a Friday, and get a phone call firing them at 5.10pm! So far, so simple. As the original post made clear, it&#x27;s all about margin. And, as the original post also made clear, the result of this business model is one disastrous project after another. So why does it keep happening? The fault there lies on the client side. The clients hiring the outsourcing and consultancy firms are usually large corporates looking to manage costs down. The project sponsors are senior managers with long term careers in these highly political organisations. When their projects fail they can&#x27;t make a fuss about it as that would draw attention to their own management failures. Instead they have to pretend the project is a qualified success, and jump to another team or silo in the corporate environment so some other sucker is left clearing up the fallout. So the consequences of failure are repeatedly eluded, as Mr Pointy Headed Manager slips off to another team, and the consulting firm moves on to the next billing opportunity. I was a little shocked when all this became apparent to me, back in 2002/3, when I saw a $25,000,000 project get canned by a large US bank without ever getting into production. Now of course I understand that it&#x27;s just how orgs like EDS and IBM Global Services make their money. And the upside is, as the article points out, that it enables wealth transfer from developed economies in North America and Western Europe, to developing regions like Eastern Europe and India, by means of rising developer salaries. The conclusion I draw is don&#x27;t ever work for a &#x27;consulting&#x27; firm like ThoughtWorks. Be a permie or a contractor...",1446023856

That means opening up a connection just to see if something new is there.<p>To give an analogy that&#x27;s easy to grasp: imagine a giant sluice, big enough to fit two oil tankers. Opening a connection is like sending boats through it, the boats are the data, and the water is the power used each time. Now this sluice is a bit funny: once you operate it, it&#x27;s very efficient and automatic, <i>but it runs twenty times</i>. In other words, you want have at least forty big-ass boats full of data to send through if you don&#x27;t want to waste energy (to be clear, I just pulled these numbers out of the air; and in a real sluice that would be forty boats both ways, but internet connections are a bit different).<p>Now imagine you just send a teeny tiny boat checking for new messages each time. If there&#x27;s a message, data will be sent back (other boats). If not, due to how 2/3/4G work, <i>the sluice will still open and close forty times</i>. That&#x27;a s LOT of wasted water. It also takes time to operate the sluice.<p>Not everyone who develops these apps is aware of this, so some naive app developers <i>poll all the time</i>.<p>What would be amazing if the phone OS provided some sort of batching system where these polling messages would queue up, and it would connect for all of them at once. I dunno, maybe the newer phones have something like that.",1446023755

The country&#x27;s growth rate has stalled to just 1.5% of GDP and unemployment has increased to 25% under the standard definition and over 40% under the expanded definition. The mining sector, once a big part of the South African economy, is collapsing.<p>At the same time, the ANC has more than doubled the number of civil servants and paid them inflated salaries, resulting in a state wage bill that takes up a whopping 45-50% of the entire government&#x27;s budget. That&#x27;s one reason why government subsidies for universities have been steadily decreasing over the past decade, forcing universities to increase fees to make up the difference. What&#x27;s worse is that the universities are facing higher-than-inflation cost increases of their own, thanks to a severe shortage of academics, the decline of the Rand against the US Dollar and big increases in the price of electricity.<p>There is a state entity that&#x27;s supposed to aid poor students with student loans, called NSFAS, but it&#x27;s extremely dysfunctional, riddled with corruption and effectively bankrupt so it only supports a relatively small number of students.<p>There simply isn&#x27;t enough available money remaining to increase those subsidies either, given that the Treasury&#x27;s contingency reserve for the next three years was swallowed up by a R60 billion increase in civil servant salaries and VAT, personal and business taxes are all comparatively high already.<p>Thus what we&#x27;re seeing now is born of frustration on the part of students, who are facing 10-12% increases in student fees, insufficient bursaries or loans and an uncertain future where most will probably be unable to find employment even if they beat the odds and become one of the 30% or so of students who actually finish their degrees. The level of political organisation and dynamism shown by the students may indeed be a positive thing over the long term, it&#x27;s too soon to tell just yet, but at the moment it shares more in common with the boiling over seen during the Arab Spring than anything else.<p>As an aside, you mentioned mg.co.za. That&#x27;s the site of the Mail & Guardian which is 30 year old weekly newspaper, not new online publication. Their website was created in 1995, but the paper itself dates from 1985 when staff of the closing Rand Daily Mail and Sunday Express (founded in 1902 and 1934 respectively) got together to form it. Sadly it, too, is going bankrupt, in part thanks to a government decision that all state job and tender advertising only be channeled through newspapers that are considered &#x27;friendly&#x27;.<p>In short, these protests are a symptom of South Africa&#x27;s economic and political stagnation and mismanagement, especially over the past few years under the leadership of Jacob Zuma.

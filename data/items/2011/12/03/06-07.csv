3307130,comment,3305870,3305870,12,0,sanjiallblue,,,"This article ignores a very central tenet of becoming rich:<p>Luck.<p>Most people didn't get in the position they were because they were geniuses. Few individuals fill that role. They get there because they were lucky. Bill Gates certainly wasn't the best programmer of his day and he most definitely wasn't the most adept businessman and he wasn't the most brilliant thief.<p>He was lucky.<p>He turned out a product that everyone wanted at exactly the right time. Now, as businesses have evolved alongside technology there certainly is slightly less luck (I would personally contend only slightly). But the founders of Netflix probably weren't the first people to think about mailing rental DVDs to customers, they just had the money and the capital to make it happen when the market was just enough ready to accept their existence. They developed expertise in that particular business, mailing DVDs to customers, and killed an entire other industry (for all intents and purposes) in the process.<p>How the author relates this to their streaming model (what was motivated the change) is baffling to me. Her entire premise seems to try and imply that the wealthy are somehow more intelligent and that, pardon the frankness, is fucking idiotic.<p>Netflix didn't become a giant through streaming content. They parlayed DVD money into a streaming business because the whole industry was making a very obvious shift in that direction. I mean hell, if they were half the geniuses that the author makes them out to be they wouldn't have selected Silverlight as the backbone of their service.<p>All I saw was a group of lucky people in one industry try to jump into another industry that appeared deceptively similar, and just because Hastings is their CEO doesn't make me think he's intelligent. If anything he's demonstrated that he doesn't fully understand the economics of splitting media.<p>The Quickster Announcement came off to me as a very stubborn businessman, tricked into thinking himself intelligent and a captain of industry by his fabulous luck, making a rash decision to vindicate a strong opinion he had behind closed doors.<p>The only thing I can take from this article is that money does a very good job of making the rich think that they're intelligent.",1322894292

3307128,comment,3306723,3306723,5,0,karpathy,,,"I use Google+ fairly extensively for mid-sized ""blogs"" of a few paragraphs at a time (usually anywhere from 2-4). I do maintain an actual blog, but lately I've started to copy paste any blog entry I make into Google+.<p>There are many advantages to using Google+:\n- Most notably, the audience is just much bigger, and the engagement is much greater because there is nearly zero friction to posting. I've been blogging for few years and G+ing (is that even a word) only since it came out, but I have ~40 subscribers to my RSS and ~1400 followers on G+. Audience is a big deal. People don't really use RSS. I get much more interaction on G+ than on my blog, and I like it.<p>- you and your (presumably good) content are much more discoverable, which allows you to grow your network and find more interesting people. It can also act as a nice easily discoverable portfolio. How often will a random person stumble by your blog? vs. How often will someone land on your G+ page? This will only become more and more likely as Google integrates G+ with Every thing.<p>- maintaining a blog has some weird connotations that I can't quite put a finger on. People sometimes ask me if I have a blog, and I always feel a little awkward inside saying yes. These connotations are somehow absent when I tell people I'm on G+. Maybe it's just the term and the way I hear it used, I really don't know.<p>I don't understand your concerns about who _really_ stores the data, or the like. Thank god I don't have to go through all that trouble just to be in charge of some text boxes on the internet. And so what if Google can use my posts to learn more about me and give me more targetted ads? I just see that as a win on my side once again-- I don't want to see mortgage ads on my banners or something.",1322894275

The best way to do a really good job of it is to have the sale of those items integrated entirely in to Google's ""platform."" All the other pieces, such as Google Checkout, are already in place and mature.<p>If Google ships, they know an item was sold and who bought it. They know everything. Their listings can be on a CPA basis rather than CPC for the advertisers (merchants.) The cost for shipping probably could be absorbed by the merchant in much the same way that merchants pay for advertising in the first place.<p>In the short term, it probably doesn't make much sense. In the long term, Google is probably more interested in cutting out the retail middle man then they are competing with Amazon.",1322894250

3307088,comment,3306364,3306364,4,0,commieneko,,,"Interestingly, when I was in college, 30 years ago, the writing and communications classes were well segregated from the literature classes. They were very hands on and you could pick your own topics or choose from a selection the teachers provided; I usually wrote on topics from my field of study.  The courses were rigorous, often touching on linguistic theory in addition to grammar.<p>I had one teacher that was very clear that authors not only <i>could,</i> but <i>should</i> be willing to break any rule of grammar or style as needed. We'd often get assignments that included breaking rules that we'd previously studied.<p>The one bit of literature that I remember creeping in, other than a few of the other student's essays (we read our assignments out loud in front of the class every day), were a couple of Max Shulman short stories. The teacher had us read them because they both concerned logic, presentation, and literary writing styles.  They were also funny as hell and I became a lifelong Shulman fan. I can't remember the titles, but they were both <i>Dobie Gillis</i> stories.<p>Later, when I took some of the literature courses, I was surprised by the lower quality of the teaching and the coursework.  Totally different teaching staff and curriculum.<p>Edit: FWIW, in my high school, the literary classes and grammar/writing classes were also separate; although the same teachers taught both types of classes.  I remember writing essays in the literature classes, but the writing classes usually had assigned topics that were not about literature.  The literature essays were definitely more concerned with the topic of the stories we were reading, and not about learning to write.<p>This was all in the mid southern U.S., in the late '70s.",1322893239

I could see them reducing cost of delivery in the following ways:<p>1.  Using automated routing tools to allocate delivery resources in real-time.  Currently, a human dispatcher can account for up to 35% of the cost of a same-day local delivery.  Straight from an algorithm to a mobile phone is cheaper.<p>2.  Using delivery contractors to collect video data to help build in the direction of an even richer google maps street view.<p>3.  Eventually using autonomous vehicles to replace the human driver.  I'm not saying this will happen any time soon, but I could see certain sections of city roads being approved for autonomous vehicle use in the next 3-5 years.  Especially if google is pushing it while demonstrating safety.  Paying a human driver can account for up to 60% of the cost of a same-day local delivery.<p>Also, there are some intangible aspects of having the relationship with a customer at their doorstep.  Creates some advertising opportunities and gives nice contextual data about the customer.<p>Anyhow, being fairly familiar with the space I think Amazon and Google moving in this direction will really evolve online retail.  More shipping options on products; more goods being shipped locally (for cheaper); more control over the delivery chain; visibility of exactly where your package is on the way to your house.  That is the kind of innovation we can expect to see if google finds a way to leverage its data towards lower delivery cost.",1322892801

The delayed responses are far more intuitively compatible with hardware keys. You can press, let go, and know what's going to happen. The tactile feedback makes up for the delayed UI response.<p>But with the Kindle Touch, I press.... and then I don't know if it registered or if it's just slow, so I press again and again. I think a lot of it has to do with the general sluggishness of the Touch models that the blog author mentioned - it's very, very noticeable. But the other part is just that at the end of the day, feedback is important.

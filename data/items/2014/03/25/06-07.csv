7464315,story,,,12,16,ac1294,"Ask HN: Was everyone's first web development experience extremely difficult?",,"I started reading Hacker News about two years ago (freshman year in college), and I was instantly motivated to start coding. I decided to major in EE, and I&#x27;ve done well in my C/C++ programming classes. I also picked up Python and R for some work on personal projects.<p>However, almost all of my coding has been limited to the command line. Although its been fun, I&#x27;ve been interested in designing a web-app for a while. Some of the posts on Hacker News make the process sound so easy, so I finally built up the motivation to start.<p>I decided to use Python as a backend, since I know that language best. I chose Flask as my web framework because it&#x27;s supposed to be one of the simplest frameworks for Python. Unfortunately, I&#x27;m struggling to understand proper file structure and basic features such as blueprints, forms, models, and controllers. Most Flask tutorials go over these terms too quickly for me to properly understand them.<p>I wanted to manage users on the web-app, so I needed a database. I picked SQLite. Just like with the frameworks, I had to pick a solution without even understanding what the solution was doing. Fortunately, SQLite and databases haven’t been as difficult to pick up as Flask.<p>To control my web-app’s appearance, I picked up HTML and CSS. The tutorials on w3schools were nice, but I couldn&#x27;t imagine building an entire app manually. And then I came across Bootstrap! It&#x27;s an extremely helpful framework, but again, it&#x27;s another tool I&#x27;ve had to learn.<p>One feature I wanted was interactive graphs, so I went to JavaScript. Codecademy helped me with the syntax, and I eventually found the Highcharts library. This has been the easiest tool to learn due to their comprehensive documentation.<p>Learning these tools individually is tough. Making them work together is even tougher. The posts on Hacker News make the web development process seem so easy. Was everyone&#x27;s first experience this rough?",1395730613

7464311,comment,7452231,7452878,1,0,tjl,,,"Only part of the business of a university is to teach. For most universities far more time is allocated to research than teaching. At my university, professors split time between teaching, research, and service (where service is things like department chair or serving on a committee). Depending on your position, the breakdown of these varies. So, department chairs do less teaching (or possibly none) because their time is needed for service instead.<p>As others have pointed out, a wiki for any material is kind of a non-starter as it would depend on the IP rights at the university. At mine, all IP is owned by the creator (with the university having non-exclusive rights to use it), with a few exceptions.<p>Most professors I know don&#x27;t assign their own books. In my department, I only know of one (or two depending on how you count it). The one is a grad course and is really one of the few on the topic (and is actually written by ten different authors, not just the professor). My supervisor assigns his advanced dynamics text for his course, but they&#x27;re sold through the copy centre (at the standard copy rate) as they&#x27;re bound photocopies. I think they were under $30 which is far less than alternatives.<p>My university requires that all Master&#x27;s and Ph.D. theses (not thesii) be made available electronically (as PDFs) as has since 2002. So, they don&#x27;t just sit on a shelf. So, both my Master&#x27;s and my Ph.D. thesis are on the web for anyone to download (and I have them linked from my LinkedIn page).<p>Many universities require graduate theses be made available electronically, so I don&#x27;t see where your issue is with that. I can&#x27;t see a wiki being any better than a simple search engine for theses. For example, one could have material that fits all over a wiki in one thesis. My Master&#x27;s research is still being cited by two very disparate disciplines. Both theses of mine are easily found using Google Scholar with appropriate search terms (i.e., ones applicable to the content). My Master&#x27;s even has two citations just last year.<p>How is one supposed to put links on a CV for pages edited by many authors?<p>I know of no professors who are wined and dined by textbook publishers. I know that publishers send review copies and they do meet with professors, but all the meetings I know of have happened in professors offices or a meeting room.",1395730559

7464308,comment,7459529,7462022,2,0,mercurial,,,"> It&#x27;s well known that government incentives tip the scale in favor of some more marriages. It&#x27;s the reason the incentives were created in the first place, obviously!<p>It is? First off, the fact that a policy has been put in place is no evidence that it actually works (see also &quot;trickle down economics&quot; and &quot;abstinence-based sex programs&quot;). Secondly, it&#x27;s difficult to argue about the purpose of the incentives outside of a historical context. The best I&#x27;ve been able to find is regarding the tax part of the incentives: <a href=""http://www.ncpa.org/pub/bg145?pg=2"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ncpa.org/pub/bg145?pg=2</a>\nIt does not appear to be part of a nefarious plot to get more people married.<p>> you&#x27;re welcome to read papers that are tangentially related and prove the the point of how strongly influenced by economics/finances marriages are<p>After skimming the papers, my understanding is that they demonstrate that for a number of women, the social condition of their prospective husband is a huge motivational factor. That is fine and well, but what does it have to do with the state? I&#x27;m sure you could find the same studies regarding unmarried couples. I haven&#x27;t found any mention of government incentives in them, but I may have overlooked something.<p>> Also, you&#x27;re ignoring most of the argument - it&#x27;s not just about the tax incentive - it&#x27;s about all of the incentives that government licensed marriage creates. Re-read my prior comments throughout this whole discussion if you don&#x27;t know what I mean.<p>You are correct that I focused on the tax incentives, as I see that as the most visible of the government-provided incentives. Let&#x27;s look at the other benefits you list:<p>> (taxes, pensions, medical benefits) and implicit (encouraging a social construct through government enforcement of licenses and contracts)<p>I&#x27;m not aware of any pension-related advantage of married couples where I live, and there is certainly no medical benefits in a land of socialized healthcare. Is this a US thing? As for the implicit benefits, I&#x27;m not entirely clear on what you mean.

But the OP&#x27;s solution still works in many cases. A fine first answer. Any time a candidate writes code for you during an interview, the first answer will most likely have issues (stress, trying to finish quickly to impress, etc). I care very little about that stuff if there answer is roughly functional. After they have their first stab out, then you go thru the &#x27;why did you do it this way?&#x27; &#x27;what corner cases might you be concerned about?&#x27; and so on.

7464258,comment,7463671,7464130,4,0,benjamincburns,,,"> See, this is a mistake. Abstraction is not an end in itself; it&#x27;s there to make life easier and to make things easier to undestand.<p>> Bloat is one of the many things abstraction is supposed to reduce; if an abstraction is increasing cognitive overhead and reducing the signal-to-noise ratio, then we&#x27;ve got ourselves a problem.<p>I whole-heartedly agree, but I&#x27;d caution readers not to conflate abstraction with bloat. If it&#x27;s bloat, chances are you&#x27;re abstracting the wrong details, and working on a system suffering from poor cohesion.<p>> For reasons that I cannot comprehend, Java seems to be the only language that seems to have excessive abstraction as a requirement. Not as a convenience, not as a nicety, but as a requirement to do things like Dependency Injection, Inversion of Control, Unit Testing, Mocks, logging, etc. The fact that you need to use entire frameworks to accomplish the functionality that in many languages is covered by a couple functions in a built-in module is a mystery to me.<p>I&#x27;m not sure I follow. Are you saying that you think it&#x27;s wrong or inconvenient that these features aren&#x27;t somehow natively supported by the language? That is, that you&#x27;d like to have a grammar/syntax around each one of these things which ultimately boils down to a bunch of hidden runtime anyway?<p>Maybe it might help to clarify that I&#x27;m defending Java the language, not Java the runtime library.<p>> Java ... seems to be the only technology that requires me to grok a dozen files to understand basic workings of MVC systems with the most elementary of logic<p>I do agree that web frameworks in Java are one area where there&#x27;s just tons of bloat, but I still don&#x27;t think that has anything to do with how the language is designed. My advice: get a better MVC. There&#x27;s nothing about MVC that says you must use a framework. (Edit: if it&#x27;s the container that you&#x27;re fighting with, there are tons of other options out there aside from the mainstream few).<p>Also, check out the network code in the Linux kernel sometime. Beautiful code, but holy shit do you need to shave a whole heard of yaks the first time you go to read it. The cognitive overhead <i>is</i> high, but each one of those abstractions is there for a reason.<p>> This points to me towards the idea that Java abstractions have simply been poorly chosen.<p>Again, given that I&#x27;m talking about the language alone, not the runtime library, if you still uphold your response I&#x27;d ask you to consider who&#x27;s fault it might be that the abstractions used in your program(s) are poorly chosen. It&#x27;s quite rare that it&#x27;s the fault of the language.",1395729570

This destroys the free market&#x27;s ability to choose the best product at the best price since all the products, despite their quality, have the same price.  This is the part of economics that says a free market only works as long as everyone involved has equal information.<p>And remember, a free market means the <i>consumer</i> has a right to choose, not the <i>corporation</i> has a right to trick consumers into buying at fixed prices.<p>In addition to price fixing products, companies also can&#x27;t wage fix.  If corporations were allowed to get together and decide the max they&#x27;ll all pay certain employees then they can do...well exactly this.  Also remember that these companies <i>also</i> refused to hire people who came to them, and <i>also</i> ratted out those employees to their original employer.  That goes beyond basic wage fixing and into the realm of heinous employee rights violations.<p>The main reason all of this is illegal though is because the consumers and the employees are not given all the information they need to decide.  The key to this important detail is in how all these sleazy assholes went around telling each other to be quiet.  If this action were something that was morally correct they wouldn&#x27;t need to hide it.  However they knew that if the employees knew they&#x27;d leave the company and it&#x27;d cost more to keep them.  That&#x27;s why the companies kept the information from the employees.<p>More importantly though, if the consumers know about price fixing, they revolt and entire industries collapse in huge meltdowns and the consumers stop trusting the market.  Politicians then react and pass laws against it so that there isn&#x27;t a huge economic revolt, or worse, a political bloody one.<p>Then again, programmers seem to worship corporations these days so I got no idea how this will play out.  Personally I hope we all boycott the shit out of every company on this list, but that&#x27;ll never happen as long as coders have their heads firmly planted up Ayn Rand&#x27;s ass.<p>The one thing that I&#x27;m enjoying coming out is how this is proving to programmers that they are valuable.  I think before this coders just kind of thought of their value as just a typical cube farming wage slave.  Now they see that they&#x27;re so valuable that corporations will go to very great lengths to keep them from leaving and from paying them what they&#x27;re worth.<p>That is definitely going to be interesting to watch play out.",1395729143

But I do agree forcing out ideas without much thought and in usually limited amounts of time can result in some horribly uncreative ideas.<p>You can&#x27;t force an idea, they just come and history has proven you come up with creative solutions and ideas to things when you try and fail, sometimes hundreds and thousands of times.<p>Do you think Thomas Edison invented the light-bulb right away? He failed multiple times, he didn&#x27;t succeed the first time he created something. In-fact, I am fairly certain although nobody knows the exact figure, but it was over 1000 attempts. The difference between a good idea and a bad one is experimentation and the execution of said idea.<p>Once you have the initial idea, it never hurts to have a post-idea brainstorm to help further refine the idea. Conception should be natural, but getting multiple people involved to refine the core idea I think is still a great way to help a great idea even better as you get more than one angle you should approach it from. Don&#x27;t be confused here, this is a different kind of brainstorm, not an ideation brainstorm like the article touches upon.<p>Great article that I think some companies who insist on brainstorming should read before they decide to pull an all day brainstorming session that will ultimately result in most likely nothing substantial or worthwhile.",1395727462

7464130,comment,7463671,7464090,13,0,Daishiman,,,"> I can agree that Java is a verbose language, and sometimes it&#x27;s really difficult to express an abstraction succinctly as compared to some other languages. I can agree that it&#x27;s also easy for people to run wild and over abstract. However, I think it&#x27;s just as likely for people to mistake well abstracted code for needlessly verbose code.<p>See, this is a mistake. Abstraction is not an end in itself; it&#x27;s there to make life easier and to make things easier to undestand.<p>Bloat is one of the many things abstraction is supposed to reduce; if an abstraction is <i>increasing</i> cognitive overhead and reducing the signal-to-noise ratio, then we&#x27;ve got ourselves a problem.<p>For reasons that I cannot comprehend, Java seems to be the only language that seems to have excessive abstraction as a requirement. Not as a convenience, not as a nicety, but as a <i>requirement</i> to do things like Dependency Injection, Inversion of Control, Unit Testing, Mocks, logging, etc. The fact that you need to use entire frameworks to accomplish the functionality that in many languages is covered by a couple functions in a built-in module is a mystery to me.<p>I&#x27;m not the wisest expert, but I have over a decade in a field and I&#x27;ve worked in all sorts of different software, and Java (along with some very badly written .NET systems) seems to be the only technology that requires me to grok a dozen files to understand basic workings of MVC systems with the most elementary of logic. And the thing is, 90% of that code is absolutely useless to the extent of the use cases proposed by the system, and none of its potential extensibility is actually used. You have to ask yourself how come neither Python nor Haskell have these monstruous frameworks.<p>Sure, it&#x27;s a lot better now, after having caught up 8 years behind the rest of technologies, but the foundations are notoriously complicated for things that are effortless with other tools.<p>This points to me towards the idea that Java abstractions have simply been poorly chosen.",1395727276

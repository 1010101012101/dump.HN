7828306,comment,7826915,7828193,2,0,jakejake,,,"I&#x27;m not 100% sure your point but if you release work under the GPL then yes, you are giving people explicit permission to copy and share your work under those conditions. But, to use that as an example, if you enjoy pirating music and movies then, to be consistent, I feel you should also support violating the terms of the GPL and all other licenses. In other words, you should not be upset when for-profit companies use GPL code and do not give back or comply with the GPL conditions. Because if you do feel that the idea of licenses and intellectual property are bullshit, then everyone should just be able to ignore them and do whatever they want. As long as someone can get their hands on the code then they should be able to do whatever they want with it.<p>I think that&#x27;s a messed up attitude personally, but at least it is a <i>consistent</i> attitude towards intellectual property.  I could respect somebody for being consistent in their attitude - especially if they themselves are also having their work pirated.  Anybody who is pirating music and movies, but they themselves do not tolerate disobeying the license terms of their own work I feel is a hypocrite.",1401602317

Amazon is kindof figuring this out, Google figured it out about 10 years ago. Once you get to that point you realize you can push computation into the storage and that not only gives you resiliency in the face of module failure it make return from disaster faster (something the Joyent people might have a better appreciation for at this point).<p>32 full speed SATA ports give you 3,200 Magnetic IOP/s and 25,000 Silicon IOP/s.

In general the photovoltaic technology efficiency is about 17%, commercially it&#x27;s about 27% and there&#x27;s technology reaching up to 45% but not commercially available.<p>There&#x27;s another problem, the efficiency drops with temperature. I don&#x27;t know what kind of heat dissipation this technology is capable of but assuming the worst case scenario the solar panels will surpass boiling point temperature. This means that without cooling the system in the solar peak it will have the worst efficiency by a huge margin. A typical solar panel is cooled by air, this possibly is siting in a heat insulator.<p>Another problem are the scratches. Ideally the glass need to be clear, but over time it will lose it&#x27;s transparency so there is another mayor drop in the production.<p>There&#x27;s another problem. As you can see in the video, using these roads you need to transport energy in or out. For do that you need wires, many, but they are expensive. Consider you don&#x27;t use the energy generation... you still need wires to use the leds.<p>I consider more intelligent put photovoltaic cells in every building in the city. As you use the same power infrastructure you don&#x27;t need to worry to install new wires. As the cities concentrate the use of energy then the lose of power due to heat (Joule Law) it&#x27;s reduced. It&#x27;s a plus in efficiency. As daily beings even if we don&#x27;t save the energy collected (because batteries are expensive) is a win. We could use other energy sources during the night. There&#x27;s another possibility, some scientist are trying to create a photovoltaic paint, this will be even more cheap but also less efficient.<p>Another ideas. Use the heat produced in thermal plants (Gas/carbon/Dissel). For example to heat the roadways or houses in cold areas (you will heat you house anyway). Use the heat for industries: smelters, oil refineries, glass makers among other. Remember the heat is a waste anyway, but is useful in many industries.<p>Use the sewer waste to produce biomass energy. Think about it, if your feces produce methane in your body before you poop... The idea is, in general the energy we use is carbon buried eons ago. Methane does not add carbon the the atmosphere only use carbon already there. Then add the previous idea and... imagine how much petroleum you can cut with this.",1401599914

In the context of the date of the article he addresses the physical limitations in place at the time, implying devices that don&#x27;t come close to the physical limitation can see improvement.<p>>No matter how small the amount of data, for any particular network device there&#x27;s always a minimum time that you can never beat. That&#x27;s called the latency of the device. For a typical Ethernet connection the latency is usually about 0.3ms (milliseconds -- thousandths of a second). For a typical modem link the latency is usually about 100ms, about 300 times worse than Ethernet.<p>Furthermore, he directly addresses the possibilities of improving things in software, including buffering. Maybe not the fantasy algorithmic improvements you&#x27;re speculating about but concrete design improvements in the modem stack available at the time.<p>>Because when you use the Geoport adapter the modem software is running on the same CPU as your TCP/IP software and your Web browser, it could know exactly what you are doing. When your Web browser sends a TCP packet, there&#x27;s no need for the Geoport modem software to mimic the behaviour of current modems. It could take that packet, encode it, and start sending it over the telephone line immediately, with almost zero latency.<p>You&#x27;re correct about many of our current latency issues being giant buffers developed to chase peak throughput for a marketing number instead of the low latency numbers that affect directly affect the (IMO) most interesting uses of the network: realtime interactive applications like communication and gaming.",1401599332

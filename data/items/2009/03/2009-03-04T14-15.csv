502918,comment,502074,502248,0,0,jimbokun,,,"I think that leaves Haskell and Python?<p>The Python indentation thing was an inspired choice and usually works very well, but sometimes fails in a way that would be solved neatly if everything was delimited with parentheses.  But it is a pragmatic compromise much in the spirit of the rest of Python (or ""Pythonic"" as they say).  There is a lot of use of delimiters in data collection literals and list comprehensions, though, which are commonly used parts of the language.<p>Haskell, to me, demonstrates the problem of getting rid of almost all delimiters.  I have a hard time scanning Haskell code and discerning the structure or figuring out what is being applied to what, etc.<p>I like Clojure's approach:  mix up the delimiters to provide cues for mentally parsing the code at a glance.  If you see [], it is usually a place where variables are defined and destructuring can happen.  () is function or macro application or a special form. {} is mapped data.  Along with consistent indentation, I find it quite readable.<p>I credit you, though, for declaring your hate of all delimiters equally :).  I find the people who abhor parentheses while never noticing all the {};<> in their preferred language a bit maddening.",1236177652

I tend to rant against them all the time, and I just bought a Galaxy Tab. I most like Jobs for his inspiring Stanford Speech. Yet hearing the news made me feel awful.<p>There are all sorts of aspects of the story, though. For one thing, it is a genius who is clearly extremely passionate about his work, and who has a lot of money, but he still has to yield to the disease. That is tragic.<p>Also, while I don't like Apple, I still like Jobs philosophy, and the pressure they put on other companies to improve their products.<p>I only wish Apple wouldn't be so silly with patents, they really taint my admiration for Jobs.<p>Think about it - patents are land claims in the sphere of ideas. We cheer about the innovations, but essentially it is like native Americans cheering on the colonists when they took away their land. I am surprised that for all his desire for aesthetics, Jobs was not bothered by the ugliness of patents.

I learn things far faster if I'm the one deciding what I need to know, than if I'm forced to go through the language at someone else's pace and style.  (And after college, I learned more about Java and SQL on my own than I learned in the classes.)<p>And it's not that I would get lazy in the classes, either.  I would get bored waiting for the teacher and start messing around with things while I waited, and then continue with the lesson when everyone caught up.  (Not their fault, I had other languages under my belt already.)  I tried to do just as much experimentation in class as I would at home.<p>And that was all before the internet was available to me.  Now that I have the internet, I can research questions and issues so fast that I won't even bother asking an expert sitting beside me.

For example, you can write a RedBlack/AVL tree implementation in Haskell where the types <i>prove</i> that the tree is balanced.  Haskell's type system is not strong enough to prove the order invariants are correct, though, so you'll still need to test that, but that's easier.<p>In a language with a weaker type system, you'd end up with more test code (for balance tests) and less guarantees (tests give no assurance).<p>Also, many bugs slip through tests that are meant to cover these classes of bugs.  You don't get any guarantee from tests.  Types give you nice guarantees.  They're not as comprehensive as very-expensive tests, but they're pretty cheap.  You get far more reliability-bang-for-the-buck from types, and thus the baseline from which you start testing is much higher.",1314353015

The I/O hit will only seriously affect you if you need to reset he VM so the working set needs priming in RAM again.<p>As soon as you need I/O bandwidth (much writing, or a data-set that doesn't fit easily in RAM) you need a physical machine as the I/O contention between you and other VMs will completely kill performance.<p>So as you say: real machines for significant database work and cheap VMs for your web servers and other worker tasks is often the most cost effective arrangement. Don't go too cheap on the VMs though for production work. I generally avoid ""burstable RAM"" options as I find them less reliable (I'd rather have a fixed amount that can all reliably be allocated as needed, than unpredictable reliability forcing me to put procedures in place to deal with unexpected OOM situations). And make sure you properly test the bandwidth carrying capacity: I've seen cheap hosts get good reviews where the reviewer tested incoming bandwidth but filed to test outgoing - this is not all that useful as a hosts outgoing bandwidth usually sees much more contention than the incoming.",1314352894

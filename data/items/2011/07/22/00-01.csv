However, engineers like ourselves caught up in the goal of creating a One True System often run into the dilemma of pursuing the ""MIT way"" of doing things.<p>I remember hearing that there was an MIT project that had many common goals with Tim Berner Lee's implementation of the World Wide Web.

Lee sidestepped that whole mess by showing the good old 404 page.

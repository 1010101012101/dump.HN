When I program, the type system definitely fights <i>for</i> me. It gives me a lot of guarantees, plus it&#x27;s a really convenient way of self-documentation. I mean, I&#x27;m not even talking about Haskell or something really sophisticated: I see the advantages even in old plain Java or C++ (so much that, in fact, most of my gripes about Java are about its type system not being complex enough).<p>Also, being &quot;unrestricted&quot; is far from being an universally good thing, since it also means many more opportunities for mistakes. I know for a fact that I make more mistakes in languages without static typing, but well, I guess it&#x27;s just me.",1408928368

8220145,comment,8219721,8220109,10,0,glenra,,,"What airlines are doing <i>now</i> amounts precisely to &quot;a <i>large</i> amount of security theatre to meet appearances for the customers and appease the local regulations.&quot;<p>I want to decentralize for two reasons:<p>(1) it removes single points of failure. For instance, post-911, airlines needed to GET PERMISSION to make changes such as strengthening the cockpit door or changing the protocol for opening it. Being more flexible means being able to quickly adjust to changing security circumstances.<p>(2) It gives customers the OPTION of purchasing LESS security.

Its type system may have some threadbare implementation spots – the _sre example from the standard library, for instance – but there are some compelling examples as well.<p>I, for one, have been working on an app implemented mostly with PyObjC, the bridge between Python and Objective-C. I had all but written off PyObjC as a bizarre yet unuseful language mule... but lately I had the occasion to read through the PyObjC source code base, in service of my project. Did you know that when you subclass a wrapped Objective-C type in Python, an all-new Objective-C class is created and wrapped as the descendant class, behind the scenes? That blew my mind.<p>That happens transparently, in concordance with Python&#x27;s type heiarchy and runtime ABI. As it turns out, PyObjC predates Mac OS X, and the authors have put a lot of work into mitigating things like the GIL and system events.<p>I am also a fan of Django&#x27;s field type system, as the author mentioned – and I am curious about what he thinks about descriptors (which he mentioned one but did not address) – I think descriptors are an amazing addition to the duck-typing regime in Pythonville.",1408927596

8220131,comment,8216321,8219472,1,0,srean,,,"> the interesting discussion is which is the more appropriate architecture.<p>I am quite convinced that between the two, Julia&#x27;s is the better way. I dont think you will be convinced so I will leave this thread with this last comment.<p>With Julia&#x27;s JIT, macros and multiple dispatch and type specialization there is a whole world of things that you can do in Julia _now_ that you cannot do in the Cython/Python split world. Another advantage that Julia shares is that it is not saddled with Python in a way that Cython is. You might consider this an unfair advantage though.<p>> As for debugging...<p>I think you are coming from a position that allows you to brush such issues aside with &quot;low level is hard, so suck it up. That experience is going to be bad anyway&quot;<p>I disagree. First, with Julia I probably wont need to drop down to that level as often. Secondly, Cython takes away one major redeeming quality of Python in the numeric context: Numpy array syntax. I cannot use that any more in any performant sense because that would callback into Numpy API. So now I have to writethat indexing code in low level C in Cython syntax. Thirdly, if you give me the full power of C or C++ I can manage to get low level with less complexity than the Python / Cython split world and with less things saddled on me.<p>Why do you think that it is better to talk to C through those limitations ?<p>If I do, I would be writing C in a Python syntax that supports some fuzzy subset of C and some fuzzy subset of Python, which will then get compiled by a simplistic compiler to produce quite a sizable C code which I would then compile with a C compiler to get a module with questionable debugging support. Compared to Julia this looks clearly worse to me, you may feel otherwise.<p>If I really need to write C I would prefer to have full C at my disposal without multi language split braining. I would like to speak to the C compiler without an indirection though another compiler.<p>I stand corrected about Cython&#x27;s abilities to produce a binary, but dont find the argument &quot;oh by the way it will come with the Python interpreter&quot; unless I really do want to embed a Python interpreter. Dont get me wrong, Cython is awesome if you want to integrate C with Python, I have already said this before. Its great if you have legacy Python code, or co-workers who are unfamiliar or unwilling to work with C. But when you are free of such constraints, Cython only saddles you with more.<p>As for speed of the Cython_module <---> Python bridge, I think we disagree about what is fast. Take a concrete example of gradient decent code. One way to do it is to have the gradient decent hot loop as a Cython function that takes two Python callbacks the function that you are trying to minimize, and another to compute the gradient (after all the numpy syntax is nice for such things). If you do this the speed is going to be abominable. The next option is to have the loop in Python but have the objective function and the gradient function as Cython. Even if you manage to bind these two names in the closest scope possible, Python will repeatedly lookup the names again and again before calling them from a dynamic interface, and its a Python loop, not known for speed. Furthermore in that Cython implemented function I have lost the pleasant syntax of Numpy. Furthermore, this bridge is a compiler optimization barrier. So the really viable option is to convert the containing loop in Cython, then after that what remains ? If this is what is required I would have just written this whole thing in plain C, or C++ and have had the full language and tooling at my finger tips. What additional advantage is Cython giving me here ? It is not without advantages, one I have already mentioned, integration with Python code, another is prototyping. With Julia the latter is taken care of, and the former is covered somewhat. Although If I have strong need to play well with Python _now_ I would choose Cython over Julia.<p>The example was by no means hypothetical, have done this and code speed improved by an order of magnitude when I redid it entirely in C++. Doing away with the lookups by itself sped it up and when I coaxed the compiler to optimize across the boundary, in particular inline the functions that is what gave an order of magnitude improvement. Julia&#x27;s design permits such things to happen without the need for a split-brain problem.",1408927477

The perception is not &quot;oh, this officer can&#x27;t actually deny me entry&quot;.<p>The perception is &quot;this is an immigration check at the border&quot;, and the dynamic of the situation flows from there.<p>The ticket checking by rail crews does seem to be an entirely German thing (again, other countries&#x27; rail crews just had a list and marked which seats had been checked, so even if another crew or crew member came through later they didn&#x27;t need to repeat it), and I suspect there&#x27;s a larger cultural pattern here tied into things like the German identification-obligation laws (which, to be honest, made me more than a bit uncomfortable when I learned about them -- I have enough trouble with the idea that in my home country courts have ruled I can be subjected to an ID check at any time, learning that it&#x27;s still a deeply-ingrained thing in a country with Germany&#x27;s history is off the scale of unsettling for me).",1408926488

You know how it is when you&#x27;re nervous - our perceptions (and our perceptions of how <i>others</i> see us) can get skewed.<p>If you truly are coming off awkwardly, what&#x27;s the real problem there? The problem is this: the interviewer is wondering, &quot;How is this guy going to interface with the rest of the team here if he&#x27;s this awkward? Does he even know he&#x27;s awkward?&quot;<p>So... you can address both of those unspoken questions head-on. Mention that you tend to get nervous in interviews and when meeting people for the first time <i>and</i> that it&#x27;s something you overcome fairly quickly and that you tend to develop really good working relationships with coworkers. (Because that&#x27;s certainly true from what you&#x27;ve said)<p><pre><code>  > I wish I had somebody who could do this for me!\n</code></pre>\nIf you live near Philadelphia I&#x27;ll do it for a beer haha.

8868942,comment,8868314,8868548,0,0,meepmorp,,,"> ... proprietary languages usually don&#x27;t survive for very long so it would be in Apples own interest that swift ends up in as many hands as possible.<p>This is wrong thinking and it misunderstands Apple&#x27;s goals and motives for Swift.<p>First and foremost, it&#x27;s a replacement for Objective-C, which is itself effectively proprietary - there are open source compilers and some legacy openstep implementations, but the driving force behind the language has been exclusively Apple for at least a decade now. In that context, Swift has the same expected level of success as Objective-C, owing to the community that exists around its predecessor. And, for Apple, the important metrics for success with Swift are entirely focused around the effectiveness of the language in support their platform. Given the relative popularity of the platform, they can reasonably expect that people will use the language to gain access to Apple&#x27;s userbase, because it&#x27;s a valuable commodity.<p>Second, Apple doesn&#x27;t care if Swift has a long life, at least, not per se. They want it to be used and to be successful because it&#x27;s where they&#x27;re probably moving their platform in the medium to long term. But they&#x27;re not invested in the longevity of the language so much as they&#x27;re invested in their platform. If, in another decade, they decide that Swift has outlived its usefulness, they&#x27;ll replace it and let it die. Any other scenario for the language failing entails Apple faltering as a company, in which case, they don&#x27;t really care about the Swift&#x27;s success.<p>(I snipped a &quot;non-&quot; off proprietary, because it didn&#x27;t seem like what you were arguing from the rest of the post.)",1420947385

8868912,comment,8868887,8868887,0,0,michaelsbradley,,,"As a result of a discussion I had earlier today, the linked article, and a somewhat related piece published by the SFLC in 2007[1], I now feel more confused than I ever have been about the obligations imposed by the 3-Clause and 2-Clause BSD licenses[2].<p>Let me pose a hypothetical situation – I would very much appreciate informed feedback from the HN community:<p><i>Suppose Project A is licensed under 2 or 3-Clause BSD, and includes that license text at the head of each of its source code files. Now suppose Project B’s source code is derived from Project A’s source code, but the maintainer of Project B wishes to use a different license. In an effort to avoid confusion, Project B has that different license text at the head of each of its source code files, while Project A&#x27;s original license text has been moved off to a file bundled in Project B&#x27;s source distributions, e.g. “licenses/ORIGINAL-PROJECTA-LICENSE.txt”. Assume that Project B is properly a derivative work, i.e. exclude the case where B only includes trivial changes to A&#x27;s sources.<p>Would Project B be in compliance with the “retain” language in clause #1 of the 2 or 3-Clause BSD license? Is there any case law to that effect or to the contrary?</i><p>Additionally, it seems some projects have started including extra notices in proximity to their BSD licenses. One example off the top of my head is Google Polymer:<p><a href=""https://github.com/Polymer/polymer/blob/master/banner.txt"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/Polymer/polymer/blob/master/banner.txt</a><p>&quot;This code may only be used under the BSD style license found at <a href=""http://polymer.github.io/LICENSE.txt&quot;"" rel=""nofollow"">http://polymer.github.io/LICENSE.txt&quot;</a><p>The actual text of Polymer&#x27;s license is boilerplate 3-Clause BSD:<p><a href=""http://polymer.github.io/LICENSE.txt"" rel=""nofollow"">http://polymer.github.io/LICENSE.txt</a><p>But what are the legal effects of such a notice with respect to derivative and combined works? Is the appearance of a BSD license deceiving in this case, and what&#x27;s really being imposed is a subtle form of copyleft? That&#x27;s a genuine question, not intended to be inflammatory.<p>[1] <a href=""https://www.softwarefreedom.org/resources/2007/gpl-non-gpl-collaboration.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.softwarefreedom.org/resources/2007/gpl-non-gpl-c...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://opensource.org/licenses/BSD-3-Clause"" rel=""nofollow"">http://opensource.org/licenses/BSD-3-Clause</a><p>[&] <a href=""http://opensource.org/licenses/BSD-2-Clause"" rel=""nofollow"">http://opensource.org/licenses/BSD-2-Clause</a>",1420946619

Architecturally LLVM makes huge sense. If you are a free software advocate it makes all the sense in the world as well to continue developing GCC until such a time where the technical merits of LLVM are too great to ignore.<p>And then you just release GNULVM as a fork of LLVM under the GPL and continue on your merry way. Merge in all the good stuff from GCC and upstream patches from LLVM into your working tree and get the best of both worlds, because as long as new contributions are GPL you are not enabling the deprivation of user freedoms.",1420946341

10535002,comment,10532828,10534080,0,0,paulmd,,,"IMO the most important characteristic that digital lacks is the &quot;shoulder&quot; of negative films.  Once you exceed the target exposure of the film by several stops, it starts to take exponentially more light to further expose those areas.  This translates into the ability to capture more detail in the highlights.  It&#x27;s not ideal - the tones of the film are certainly &quot;blocked up&quot;, and color film may start to show color shifts (usually to yellow).  It&#x27;s better to hit the exposure properly.  But with proper scanning or wet-printing technique (particularly split-filter printing) you can recover quite a lot of detail.<p>On digital - when the pixel goes to 255 light intensity, it&#x27;s just gone.  There&#x27;s no way to recover data that isn&#x27;t there.  The Magic Lantern firmware has the ability to scan out lines alternating between high and low ISOs to capture blown-out areas, but it&#x27;s not perfect either.<p>&quot;Modern&quot; films tend to be very well-behaved with regards to these kind of characteristics, actually.  Acros 100 has virtually no reciprocity failure - for exposures between 2 minutes and 10 minutes you need to add 1/2 stop of light.  I&#x27;ve recovered pictures off negatives with virtually no visible exposure.  The tonality is great and the grain is virtually invisible even with Rodinal. The new Portra 400 is also extremely forgiving - you can get something workable up to about ISO 1600 or 3200 with standard processing, and if you push process (develop longer) it&#x27;s even better.",1447095595

Sorry to tell you, but they seem as &quot;hard news&quot; as CNN. It is infotainment. Most of the topics are still about what is popular, what can generate clicks and what can polarize. There is nothing in there that I feel I would pay to see investigated, studied or analyzed.<p>(1) and (3)\nThe point I am trying to get across is that any kind of business is supposed to exist to support some kind of need for society. The &quot;advertising industry&quot; only fulfills any social utlity when it manages to efficiently connect producers to their target consumer.<p>If to do that, it needs to steal attention from people, it is not doing its job properly.<p>If the &quot;advertising industry&quot; ends up providing a system that makes people consume only things from the producers with more capital, instead of the best product, then the industry is not doing its job properly.<p>If the &quot;advertising industry&quot; ends up creating by collateral a huge mass of well educated people that depend on this &quot;meta-work&quot; of producing content that can be pass for journalism or entertainment, then it fails to fulfill its social function.<p><i>>> Wikipedia isn&#x27;t a business, but their business arm Wikia makes all their money on advertising.</i><p>Society benefits from something like wikipedia. I can donate $25/year like I do to Wikipedia, and hope that enough people will contribute to it to keep it running. Good thing that Wikia can bring some funds and not have to rely on many more people. But if Wikia ceased to exist, people can still find ways to keep wikipedia around. If society loses wikipedia, we would lose a lot.<p>Now, if for some reason Wikia was not being profitable, do you really think society would be worse off? Perhaps for historical and cultural reasons, it would be bad to lose it - just look at all the work from the archive.org people. But look at Geocities: do you think society is that worse off without it? Would we be worse off without Wikia?<p><i>>> Eyeballs = attention = what advertising is all about.</i><p>To come back to my point: I do believe that there are cases where business manage to provide the social function of advertising (establish a communication channel between producers and consumers), but this &quot;produce content and try to monetize it&quot; with ads is not one such case.<p>- The content that gets produced is of dubious quality (because the focus of the content producer is not in the quality of the content, rather how much of the people&#x27;s attention it can grab)<p>- There is no real connection between content producer and the producer paying for ads. So content producers may end up becoming crap-pushers without even knowing.<p>- It makes for an uneven field for smaller producers. We live in an era where the cost of producing, processing and distributing information is almost zero. The balance of power could be completely in favor of the people. We HAVE the means of production of wealth in our hands. But because of advertising, we give this power back to the Capital owners. You describe your work as a &quot;marketing platform for top brands&quot;. Let me tell you one thing: I WANT BRANDS TO BE DESTROYED. There is no real value in brands, except for the brand owners. They stiffle innovation. They created consumerism as a lifestyle.<p>I am all for free-market and minimal intervention on business. But you state a equation like this one where &quot;attention&quot; as something that can be extracted value from WHEN IT IS NOT FUCKING YOURS! It is immoral and you don&#x27;t even see it.",1447095518

10534951,comment,10529824,10529824,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"This is a terrible source material for this kind of test. The biggest audible difference between 8 bit and 16 bit, assuming the same sample rate, is the noise floor. But, this source material is LOUD throughout, which masks the noise floor. It is in dynamic material that bit depth makes an audible difference. The prior listening test used Gangnam Style, which is also loud and lacking in dynamics that would reveal audible distortion due to low bit depth.<p>The thing is that I agree with Monty on the (lack of) need for 24/196 audio for consumers. My degree is in audio, and I (mostly) understand the physics of the thing (and have done tons of blind listening experiments in controlled environments using professional equipment, as well as using high quality measurement tools for spectrum analysis, etc.). But, this particular test isn&#x27;t really a useful proof that we don&#x27;t need 24 bit and 196k. It only proves that loud material can mask noise, even at 8 bits.<p>Using a more dynamic Neil Young song would have been a better choice. Maybe <i>Old Man</i>, or similar. Acoustic guitar is good for allowing one to discern audio equipment flaws. It is commonly the source material people use when trying to rate good pieces of equipment that have very small differences across a very broad price spectrum (microphones, preamps, etc.).<p>Nonetheless, I got 8/10 right using crappy ear buds in a noisy place, which isn&#x27;t much better than random chance. I&#x27;m pretty confident I&#x27;d be able to recognize 8 bit vs 16 bit on any reasonably dynamic source played on good equipment in a good listening environment. But, I also <i>know</i> I can&#x27;t recognize 16 bit vs 24 bit (I&#x27;ve tested), and I know Neil Young can&#x27;t either. Neil Young was around for the era when ADC/DAC quality was very poor; it actually was true that many early digital recordings were inferior to the very high end analog recordings of the time. And, it&#x27;s even true that when recording, mixing, and mastering, it is useful to work at higher bit depths (because there&#x27;s a lot of summing, raising the noise floor each time; though that may just mean you need to process at 24 or 32 bits, rather than actually record at higher depths).<p>It seems obvious, to me, that the reason most music sounds like shit is because of the loudness wars (dynamics reduction), lossy compression (cramming a lot of music down tiny network pipes), and the low quality of most people&#x27;s listening equipment and environment. Those factors utterly dwarf the noise floor of 16 bit audio, and completely nullify any frequency advantages of higher bit rates (even if we could hear them).<p>In short: Pono is elitist bullshit, as most audiophile stuff is.",1447095223

Like I&#x27;ve said before here on HN, I don&#x27;t think it helps us (programmers).  We should own our title and wear it with pride.  Taking someone else&#x27;s title does two bad things - first, it opens programmers to the charge that they are insecure and are misappropriating someone else&#x27;s hard earned title and reputation.  Second, it may give engineers (the PE kind) the impression that they have some claim on software development.  That last part is important, because I would prefer not to see software regulated by the PE exams (though my objection to this diminished greatly when they went to much more industry specific exams).<p>I consider software development to be a genuinely difficult task, one that can push very smart people past the edge of their own capabilities.  It can be intensely creative, and the stakes can be very high.  However, I think we should just consider it to be its own thing.<p>Now, all that said, I&#x27;ll go back to my first statement: eh.  In a world of train engineers, special effects or sound engineers, financial engineers, pft.  Calling someone who reads a book on PHP (or buys one but doesn&#x27;t read it) and throws up a bug ridden website an &quot;engineer&quot; seems a bit of a stretch, but is it really so outrageous to call someone who has spend decades learning to design highly complex, scalable, performant software applications that need to be reliable in  a high stakes environment an &quot;engineer&quot;?  Is that really such an egregious use of the word?<p>Like I said, I&#x27;d rather software developers redirect that impressive accomplishment back to the word &quot;programmer&quot; or &quot;developer&quot;, but in the end, this whole thing is completely overblown.",1447095161

As you pointed out, if a lot of people are colocated in a region with a scarcity of minimally-acceptable housing, then the first condition of the American dream (that a lot of these people have compensation comfortably in excess of the cost to live (e.g. the cost to buy the property they want)) necessarily implies that prices will be bid upward just to the point where all of the &quot;comfortable excess&quot; that the compensation-above-cost-of-living is eaten up by the elevated home prices.<p>So the second condition of the American dream, (&quot;a place to live that you can afford&quot;) can only be fulfilled if you change your perception about what kind of home you want -- and so a lot of the article can be understood as describing a preference shift in Millennials (and many others, for example I am a bit older than Millenials but also face this dilemma).<p>Instead of preferring &quot;normal American family homes&quot; as have been readily available in many good-to-live-in places for about the last half century, we now have to say that that preference is no longer an affordable preference to have (even though probably most of us are unhappy that changing world circumstances has dictated this change in the affordability of the preference, and feel it is an overall bad sign for world economic progress). And we replace the preference with what seems to be more of a desire for social mobility, urban amenities, and proximity to very large employment hubs.<p>The inevitable tension between the two components of the American dream, good job and affordable house, has caught up to us, which is perfectly predictable, and in response, it seems social mobility is more preferred than preserving the sort of American &#x27;family home&#x27; lifestyle by foregoing wages and social mobility in order to live in a more affordable area.<p>I expect that a lot of this has to do with status signaling and money, and probably also mate selection. The relative gains in status to pure wealth optimization seem much stronger now than before -- even if wealth was still the most dominant part of status in the past. This is anecdotal, so I could be very wrong, but it just seems to me that you could earn a lot less, but establish a family home, and still be a high-status member of a community in the past.<p>But now, it&#x27;s just money.<p>It doesn&#x27;t matter if you&#x27;ve built your own, stable life in a small town community in America, and you&#x27;ve done so with extremely impressive hard work, frugality, and wits, while also supporting and nurturing a family. If you do all that now, but you don&#x27;t earn a high wage, you&#x27;re treated as a total nobody for society to shit on and mock.<p>But if you spend all day doing things that are arguably bad for society in a cubicle farm in a skyscraper and go home to a tiny apartment in a city where you&#x27;ll never be able to buy property, yet your salary is in the top 25% in the country, you&#x27;re treated like you deserve respect and like you are a productive member of society.

Certainly your mileage will vary:<p>* Self-knowledge is the most powerful tool there is: What suits you, what doesn&#x27;t; your strengths and weaknesses; your talents and blindspots; your limits; what you need, can tolerate and can&#x27;t; what you love and hate; what makes you feel safe and strong and helps you thrive, and what leaves you traumatized. If you think you already know yourself, you almost certainly don&#x27;t. You never fully know but you want to learn as much as you can (and in the process you&#x27;ll learn to understand other people). It&#x27;s the basis of every important decision you must make: Do I choose this career? Do I trust myself to take on the responsibility of this business, with all these people&#x27;s fortunes and careers depending on me? Can I commit to love and care for this person for life? Is she/he right for me? Am I ready to put an infant human&#x27;s life and development in my hands (and can I handle the work/life balance and pressure)? Many people make poor decisions about these issues - How can they make good ones if they don&#x27;t know the key factor, themselves?<p>* The only way to develop that knowledge is to try and fail, and then to get up and try again (an essential skill in itself). You can&#x27;t learn these things by just thinking about them; they aren&#x27;t in a book. And now is your chance. Later when you have a career, a mortgage, business partners, employees and children depending on you, you can&#x27;t take a big risk to just suit yourself. Also, I&#x27;m not just talking your career, but all aspects of your life: Relationships (especially relationships!), where you live, your lifestyle, etc. People playing it safe will question and criticize you (see below), but just smile and know you are moving ahead while in ten years they&#x27;ll unfortunately realize they have learned little of life and themselves.<p>* Learn to ignore everyone&#x27;s advice and criticism and to trust your own instinct and thoughts. Nobody else really understands you or your situation nearly well enough. They might have good ideas to consider, but you know best (which requires that self-knowledge). No matter what you do, people will criticize you. Even Steve Jobs was fired, Bill Gates reviled, and Martin Luther King was hated by many and polls show he was unpopular during the civil rights struggle; you could be President of the United States and people daily will call you an abject failure. And you will fail constantly, sometimes horribly, just like the rest of us, and while you are failing there will be no promise of success. Given that you will face criticism, questions, and failure no matter what, and that there is no promise of a good outcome anyway, at least do what you love and think is best, and enjoy the ride.<p>* Gather some data: Look at people at the other end of life, or ask them: What turned out to be important? My guess is most will answer, their family and personal relationships. Few people wish they had spent more time at work; many wish they had spent more with family. Finally, a good marriage is perhaps the most valuable thing in life but it takes far more than love and good will; it takes dedication, hard work, skill, and, as much as anything, self-knowledge.<p>I hope some of that is helpful!<p>EDIT: A minor edit or two",1447094482

One of them is the &quot;chart&quot; approach, where you (or an algorithm) try to discern the future movements of a company&#x27;s stock price based on the past performance. Sometimes this works. Mostly, though, it doesn&#x27;t.<p>There&#x27;s also a big difference between &quot;trading&quot; and &quot;investing.&quot; Trading is what you&#x27;ve described -- buying shares in the morning and hoping they&#x27;ll go up in the afternoon so you can sell them later. Investing is buying shares of the company to become a part owner and hold them for years or decades, not days.<p>If you looked at NFLX&#x27;s chart in 2012, you could &quot;discern&quot; that the share price would continue to hover around that price, maybe go up a little, maybe go down a little. And you could have bought it in September 2012 for $8 a share and sold for a nice $1 profit in October 2012 for $9 a share (split adjusted). But what the chart wouldn&#x27;t have told you -- and would never have been able to tell you -- is that it would skyrocket in 2013 and up to its current split-adjusted price of $110 a share. The thing is, the chart never would have told you about this. And even a &quot;pure&quot; numerical analysis like could be done by a computer -- P/E ratios, cash flows, etc -- would not have predicted that growth. You could do DCFs all day every day in 2012 and never predict Netflix&#x27;s rise. There are a lot of things that go into a company&#x27;s rise that aren&#x27;t numerical, like the quality of management, market moat, market growth, etc. And, of course, you had to buy it, and hold it for years, in order to see that return.<p>(In the interests of full disclosure, I should probably note that I&#x27;m a bit biased in this.

However, the choice of audio clip ensures that you can&#x27;t tell the difference easily.<p>It&#x27;s known that the only difference between well-prepared files of different bit depths is the noise floor.  Basically, in any PCM audio file, you can expect noise of about 1 ULP.  So in a 16-bit file you get a noise floor of -90 dB, and in an 8-bit file it&#x27;s at -42 dB.  This is the ONLY DIFFERENCE.<p>People who are here listening for distortion artifacts aren&#x27;t going to find any, and they&#x27;re going to be surprised.  That&#x27;s because you can always choose to introduce noise instead of distortion artifacts when you do the conversion.  The noise is actually added on purpose, it&#x27;s &quot;dithering noise&quot;, and it&#x27;s not there to mask the distortion, but to entirely replace it.<p>The math works like this.  Take a high-resolution input, say, 16-bit.  You&#x27;re converting it to 8-bit.  If you just convert, you&#x27;ll introduce a distortion signal of about 1ULP.  However, if you introduce 1ULP of uncorrelated rectangular noise, the distortion signal is now also uncorrelated noise, which is less objectionable than correlated noise.  It&#x27;s also harder to hear.<p>Then, how do you tell the difference between 16-bit and 8-bit audio files?  You can only do it if there&#x27;s a quiet part somewhere in there.  As soon as there&#x27;s a quiet part, you can hear a &quot;hissing&quot; sound in the 8-bit file at -42 dB.  If you&#x27;re listening to the middle of a rock song like this, the hissing sound is going to be buried in the mix.  Heck, a typical guitar amp will already be putting out uncorrelated noise.",1447093921

The produce obtainable on the best available rent-free land is known as the margin of production. Since landlords have a monopoly over a given location, the only limiting factor for rent is the margin of production. Thus, rent is a differential between the productive capacity of the land and the margin of production.</i><p>In the U.S. today, there is no free land. This changes everything.

After 7-10 days, mice with tumors of 40-60 mm3 were randomly divided into two groups. One group was treated with freshly prepared vitamin C (sodium ascorbate in 400 ul PBS, 4 g per kilogram of body weight) by intraperitoneal (IP) injection twice a day (HCT116: n=6, VACO432: n=6). Control group mice were treated with PBS instead of vitamin C with the same dosing schedule (HCT116: n=4, VACO432: n=7).&quot;<p>[...]<p>[Caption Fig 2:]<p>&quot;Tumor sizes were measured 2-3 times per week in an unblinded manner.&quot;<p><a href=""http://www.sciencemag.org/lookup/doi/10.1126/science.aaa5004"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.sciencemag.org/lookup/doi/10.1126/science.aaa5004</a><p>Not only are they mice, but they have no immune system[1]. Also, the dose of vitamin C is like consuming an entire bottle twice a day (~240 g)[2]. They are honest about the lack of blinding, which is good, but obviously that should make us wary of these findings. Also, they do not report tumor size before splitting into treatment vs control groups (only saying mice with 40-60 mm^3 tumors were used). Put the larger ones in the control group and you can easily appear to be slowing tumor growth for totally artefactual reasons.<p>For example, start with low initial (40) and high initial (60) cells in two different mice. If the cells all divide every day how many do you expect after 1:3 days. Low: 40,80,160; High: 60,120,240; Difference: 20,40,80. The difference seems to grow just due to the starting conditions, growth rates were the same. So these results are uninterpretable without knowing the starting tumor sizes.<p>[1] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nude_mouse"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nude_mouse</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.allergyresearchgroup.com/buffered-vitamin-c-240-grams-8.5-oz-powder"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.allergyresearchgroup.com/buffered-vitamin-c-240-g...</a>",1447093270

A lot of smaller municipalities (Asheville is a good example) have a cultural distaste for using services and products from outside the area due to the lack of a strong local economy and becoming potentially corporate colonies, so a lot of these companies are intentionally low market cap because they have more humble concerns than getting big, raising a bunch of funding, and retiring at 30. It&#x27;s part of why I like it here, but the lack of ambition has a double edged sword resulting in a cap on quality that is typical for most places.

And of course, all operators must use the same syntax for both.<p>This is hard to retrofit into a language. Java and C can&#x27;t retrofit either in.

Not only is this obviously unethical since it involves lying with the purpose of breaking a law, but this law also happens to be designed to try and reduce the deadly effects of pollution.

I suspect it’s rooted in his anti-nuclear and anti-war views and it just grew from there. His views on Vitamin C were just a convenient target.<p>It’s uncomfortable to those with analytical minds to accept the fact that we know so little about the human body and how it works. Studies are always contradicting each other because the scientific method dictates that studies must be reduced to the minimum of variables. But the body is far too complex for that. Most of what I was taught nutritionally in school as a kid was wrong. Most of the health advice was wrong. We were told butter is evil and we should eat margerine. We were told fat was evil and that cholesterol causes heart disease despite no evidence other than correlation. We don’t know how or even if consumed cholesterol gets turned into cholesterol in the bloodstream. It’s virtually universally believed that salt is bad despite it being an essential nutrient. It’s universally believed that sun is bad and we must slather ourselves with sunscreen and now we all have Vitamin D deficiencies. Read the literature that comes with any prescription drug and there will be a paragraph explaining that they have no idea how the drug works. Many are no more effective than a placebo. There’s a perception that has persisted most of my life that we are always at a point where we have these things figured out, but ten years later they are proven wrong, but we don’t seem to notice that.<p>There is an almost religious fervor surrounding science when it comes to our health and nutrition. Lots of research in the past few years surrounds gut bacteria, something that wasn’t even on the charts even 10 years ago. Now we are realizing that we not only know nothing, we know less than nothing.<p>I don’t think Pauling will be vindicated on Vitamin C because this came from a time when it was universally thought that there was a pill or an injecton for anything and we just had to discover it. If you read Pauling’s books, you’ll realize that he never advocated it as a panacea, but part of a complete dietary and mental regimen. His research is compelling and it’s not hard to see how he came to the conclusions that he did.<p>It’s good to hear I’m not the only one learning from history and realizing the uncomfortable fact that we know so little and this treatment of ulcers is the exception rather than the rule. How did we not discover this was bacterial for so long? It’s not like this is the 19th century after all.",1447092134

With C++, you're likely to sever an artery and need extensive vascular repair.<p>The point is that with small programs that operate on big data, the cost of shooting your foot is less.  There's less code to wade through, so you can find and fix your bugs quickly, and it still costs you less time than you'll lose in execution speed.<p>Other types of programs have different complexity/execution tradeoffs, and other languages may be more appropriate for them.  I actually do the majority of my programming in Python - but that's for other things, where I have to iterate rapidly yet am typically the only one hitting my server.

So the fact that they don't have templates or operator overloading (the two critical pieces to STL style) was a bit of a downer. That being said the interfaces concept reminded me of generic functions (in CLOS). Sounds pathetic but I probably will give it a try just because it's from Google -- but I'm quite skeptical.

934761,comment,934142,934726,0,0,omnigoat,,,"I'd like to make two points in response...<p>1) I did say 'savvy'. Sort of because I don't get to use that word enough, but also because it <i>is</i> possible to abuse operator overloading. String concatenation with the addition operator isn't going to suprise anyone, even if you come from another language (well, it might, but the choice of the + operator isn't an unintuitive one). Furthermore, nobody's jumping at things with well-defined operators, like vectors/matrices, etc. I've written very little outside of a maths library that used operator overloading, but it's a godsend for the cases where it's appropriate... probably a truism.<p>Secondly, they're just functions. You can look them up (y'know, assuming you can), you can optimise them, and you can document them. A programmer encountering an operator doesn't have to rely on their interpretation alone, and indeed shouldn't. They should <i>know</i> what that operator does. Now of course, if the operator has absolutely no contextual reason for existing, or is suprising divergent from its apparent purpose... well, see point 1.<p>As for your example, how do you do a greater-than-or-equal comparison on strings? :D",1257921171

Exactly. You hit the nail on the head--consequently, ""good enough"" doesn't cut it to get into MIT. You have to be the best of the best.

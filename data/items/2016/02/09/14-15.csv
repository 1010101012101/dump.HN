After we had a child, it&#x27;s been harder to make time for that. If anything, it&#x27;s more important to have a routine like this after becoming parents – but takes even more commitment to the idea.<p>A friend of mine proposed a tongue-in-cheek test for parents to assess the health of their relationship. <i>Have you and your spouse had a conversation in the last week about something other than the family (kids, elderly parents, etc.) or work?</i> He meant it mostly as a joke, but there are definitely weeks where I look back and struggle to remember a real adult conversation with my wife about anything non-family, non-work, and lately non-politics.<p>Anyway, I completely agree with you. Relationships require work, deliberate reflection, etc. You and your spouse will be different people when you&#x27;re 35 than you were when you met at 25 (or whatever ages apply to you). You will grow and change. You can either grow apart or grow together.",1455029935

If Google had to stop using OCR CAPTCHA tomorrow, they would have to use an alternative, and frankly most of the alternatives are worse. Further still without the ability to hinder bots services like Gmail couldn&#x27;t exist.<p>Arguing that Gmail is a greater benefit than the CAPTCHA costs to complete is fine, but potentially leaves the gate open to sue later because someone finds a service which they claim doesn&#x27;t benefit the end user (e.g. paying a bill). Arguing that the CAPTCHA method itself has more benefit than cost completely destroys any future lawsuits.",1455029897

My books suggest we&#x27;ve spent $3k on this in 2015. My bookkeeper, accountant, and the IRS/NTA are united on this issue: they don&#x27;t care whether a software license is OSS or not. A $1k invoice is a $1k invoice; as a software company, I have virtually carte blanche to expense any software I think is reasonably required, and I think our OSS is reasonably required.<p>I would do this more often if OSS projects made it easier for me to do so. Getting me to pay $1,000 for software is easy; committing me to doing lots of admin work over the course of a week is less easy. Take a look at what e.g. <a href=""http://sidekiq.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://sidekiq.org/</a> , which is an OSS project with a commercial model, does. Two clicks gets me to a credit card form.

But suddenly because of a psychological hang-up, because of a mysterious mumbo-jumbo about the economy, about the banking, we were all miserable and poor - starving in the midst of plenty. Just because of a psychological hang-up. And that hang-up is that money is real, and that people ought to suffer in order to get it. But the whole point of the machine is to relieve you of that suffering. It is ingenuity. You see we are psychologically back in the 17th century and technically in the 20th. And here comes the problem. So what we have to find out how to do is to change the psychological attitude to money and to wealth and further more to pleasure and further more to the nature of work.

Ususally I see &quot;closure&quot; used to denote the concept of a function that references free variables, not any specific implementation. Maybe within the guile codebase they have a construct called &quot;closure&quot; which implements closures in the most general way possible (which involves heap allocation no doubt).<p>But it&#x27;s true: lambdas ≠ closures. &quot;Lambda&quot; refers to the syntax that a language uses to allow anonymous functions. A &quot;closure&quot; is a type of function that references free variables. Java 8, for example, has lambdas, but they are not full closures, because they can only reference local variables declared in higher scopes if those are declared as final.<p>Python, on the other hand, sort of has lambdas, but they are limited to a body consisting of a single expression, which doesn&#x27;t allow e.g. conditionals. Even if it didn&#x27;t support the lambda syntax, though, it would support closures, because it lets you declare a named function during a function call, then pass it elsewhere by referencing its name. These functions can reference free variables:<p><pre><code>    def mkincer():\n        n = 0\n        def inner():\n            nonlocal n\n            n += 1\n            return n\n        return inner\n</code></pre>\n[1] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Closure_(computer_programming)"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Closure_(computer_programming)</a>",1455027686

Each summer, my classrooms fill with high school students that are intrigued by the idea of math and extremely capable. That is nice and inspiring, and generally more rewarding than when I teach  calculus classes to university students during the school year.<p>But my program is prohibitively expensive, and I&#x27;m acutely aware of the fact that when my students return to their high schools, they will almost certainly return to lackluster curricula. There are exceptions, of course. My summer program is filled with a far-above-average percentage of students attending private high schools.<p>The fact remains that students who attend the summer program are introduced to interesting math with no guided way to continue their exploration. Sometimes, students with supportive schools end up scheduling a self-study with some supervision from a high school teacher or counselor; I&#x27;ve been asked to help set up and guide self-studies, and I know at least a few of them have been successful. In my experience, this has been the best outcome for my students continuing exploration of advanced math. I&#x27;m not sure what this says about math and American high school education.",1455027266

I still love github, I find its best use case for me is a great repository of code samples(I&#x27;ve also contributed to several projects ); the social aspect is valuable (to me) because generally the most starred projects are of the highest quality, it&#x27;s a valuable vetting process.<p>The curse of the growth hacking is this: there&#x27;s a fixed number of top developers and hackers on this planet. Once you&#x27;ve crossed that number, the next new user&#x27;s input decreases the signal to noise. This happens everywhere. (not pointing any fingers to not get down votes... :-)<p>cheers!",1455026636

I think you will find after a month that it is much more enjoyable and useful. I think the real world analogy would be that Facebook is like going to a party where you know everyone already...it&#x27;s safe and comfortable. Twitter is more like moving to a new city where you don&#x27;t know a single soul. It&#x27;s scary and overwhelming, but once you adapt, a whole new world opens up to you. By taking Facebook out of your daily life for a bit, you might get to experience this whole new world...if you wish to do so.",1455026606

Quite possibly automation for fanboy relationships might be a totally different service and technology.  Maybe in the future people won&#x27;t do geolocated at all.

It basically increases the value of your web presence to a system that you can control, instead of depending on an outside platform that may not have your interests as its primary goal. While GNU Social is one (out of many) types of tools/platforms that can implement/help achieve some of those POSSE principles.

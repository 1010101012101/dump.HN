207872,comment,207486,207819,0,0,sofal,,,"I don't believe that a typical Java IDE provides a clean enough abstraction to make code generation a big benefit. When it comes down to it, you're still looking at a window full of all the code that the IDE spit out for you. Think of code generation via a compiler versus code generation via an IDE. The code that you see in the window of your IDE should be solely for human eyes. If a lot of it can be trivially automated, then it doesn't deserve space in that window.",1212501405
207871,comment,207197,207845,0,0,cia_plant,,,"Yes, they're charging the price that they can get away with. But they can only get away with it because it's an anticompetitive industry. Publishing house X should see the inflated price of ebooks as a revenue opportunity - undercut everyone else by charging less of a markup, and they would probably get a much larger chunk of the market to make up for it.<p>My guess why this isn't happening is because Publishing house X shares half its board of directors with Publishing house Y, and they have some sort of (probably implicit, since probably illegal) agreement to do whatever is necessary to keep a lock on the industry, by restricting access through new digital channels. See also: the music industry, the film industry, the television industry.",1212501067
207870,comment,207247,207747,0,0,smanek,,,"Except that you're off by (at least) several dozen orders of magnitude. Twitter, in fact, is several thousand times smaller than even GMail, which has ~100,000,000 registered users to Twitter's ~1,000,000 (<a href=""http://twitterfacts.blogspot.com/2007/10/twitter-number-of-users.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://twitterfacts.blogspot.com/2007/10/twitter-number-of-u...</a> - and that's assuming twitter's user base has over doubled in the last six months while GMails has remained stagnant for the last year or so).<p>Google manages to route large messages between GMail users instantly, without breaking a sweat, and with 100% uptime (so does Microsoft, Yahoo, and every other major email provider). They have no trouble dealing with users who send or receive thousands of emails a day, while twitter claims this is some sort of pathological, borderline-impossible case to deal with.<p>And GMail is relatively trivial compared to actually indexing the internet. The last decent estimate I saw (2005 - <a href=""http://www.cs.uiowa.edu/~asignori/web-size/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cs.uiowa.edu/~asignori/web-size/</a>) suggested the indexable WWW is ~ 12 Billion pages - and god knows how much that has increased in the last four years.<p>Seriously, make sure you're in the right ballpark - hell, in the right galaxy - before talking out off your ass. Twitter's problem should be easy today - it was solved decades ago. The fact that Twitter can't scale is nothing more than a testament to their incompetence.",1212501044

Theft is wrong because it violates the individual right of the property owner.<p>Copyright exists to provide a temporary incentive for content creators to continue producing. It's not a natural right, it's a collective bargain between the public and content producers.

A lot of major label artists don't write their own songs and it's not just the pop/r&b singers.  A lot of rock bands hire songwriters as well.  Overall, the entire industry is shady and the majors are grasping for the last bit of CD revenue that they can find.<p>You're going to see a lot more 360 deals like the one Jay-Z just did, although they'll be doing them for much smaller amounts from much smaller artists and they will be TERRIBLE deals for the artists.  Jay-Z got so much because he has the power, influence, and track record to justify it.

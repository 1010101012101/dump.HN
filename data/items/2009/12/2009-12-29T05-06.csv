Over 40% of Russian territory was not included in global-temperature calculations for unknown reasons, rather than the lack of meteorological stations and observations, according to the IEA.<p><a href=""http://global-warming.accuweather.com/2009/12/was_russian_climate_data_tampe.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://global-warming.accuweather.com/2009/12/was_russian_cl...</a>",1262066315

You have enough of a name that you should get at least a trickle of videos which you can use for public (free) parts of the site. Maybe video contributors get free access - X months per video.<p>2) Get other non-video content up there.

1020083,comment,1019001,1019734,0,0,ghshephard,,,"I absolutely agree with you that continuous deployment increases resilience.   The problem is that it also increases instability.<p>Perhaps the closest example I can think of with regards to continuous deployment in mission critical situations are the martian rovers - I think they had some real-time deployment of new code.  But, the implications of a problem with them were relatively minor - a few hundred million dollars, and no lives lost.<p>Are there any examples of continuous deployment in a scenario in which hundreds of lives and/or billions of dollars are at stake?",1262065314

If it stayed small Google wouldn't have done anything, if it succeeded they'd come after him for violating the terms, and probably end up acquiring it for little or nothing.<p><i>As far as I can see the only thing Google is ""guilty"" of is changing a few lines in their ToS, which is entirely in their right.</i><p>It is their right. It's also a change that nullified his business model, so letting him know about it would have been the non-evil thing to do, and that would have taken no additional effort since they were already communicating with him. It's possible that their failure to do so was incompetence rather than malice, but the result is the same.",1262064112

For example, it totally dominates the top500 supercomputers, is used by Google for their backend, by a large number (most?) hosting companies. This is primarily due to the overall performance characteristics being better (not some sub-benchmark where FreeBSD or Solaris or whatever pulls ahead by 1 or 2%).<p>That is to say, the Linux kernel is the fastest for general performance oriented server tasks. It may be the case that in some areas you can get some other unix-y operating systems to outperform it, and by all means use them in those circumstances for your projects, but I think your blanket unqualified dismissal of the thousands of kernel developers as being technically poor and ultimately ""worse is better"" is a bit over the top.",1262063230

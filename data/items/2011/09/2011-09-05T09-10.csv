Much of the research is not very sound, as evidenced by the low amount of detail and general amateurishness in the description of the techniques (for example, the suggestion to knock a sentry KO by taking his helmet and hitting him over the head with it) It was replaced by research from Applegate and the likes (based on experiences in WWII and subsequent wars like Korea) in the 1960's and 1970's, which in turn was replaced with the MACP (Modern Army Combatives Program) in the 1990's.<p>So yes, it's poorly written and superstitious (although the 'sixth sense' thing isn't completely bogus - although there's nothing mystical about it, it's more about the state of mind of the attacker and the avoidance of tunnel vision than a true sixth sense in the mark). But also remember that field manuals have to be written in a way to be easy to teach, to the lowest common denominator (soldiers, aka cannon fodder) who usually, and especially at that time, came from lower socio-economic backgrounds and had little critical thinking or analytical skills.",1315215405

We have witnessed the powerful benefit of twitter and FB, etc in assisting communities and families in the aftermath of disaster, but what have these ""instant info systems"" done to help people mid disaster or to prevent one all together?

The problem is that some on-the-fly internet credit card generators (like MBnet in Europe) can give you a credit card number without saying if it's a Visa or a Mastercard. It gets worse because they actually generate both types of card numbers. So whenever I am presented with one of those fields to choose a card I error 50% of the time. Annoying.<p>It's not enough for me to quit buying something but if you have also Visa Electron, Visa Debit and Visa Credit then I surely won't buy it, I would have to try so many combinations while filling parts of the form each time (because it won't keep the ccv, for example).",1315213727

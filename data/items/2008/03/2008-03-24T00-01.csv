Disable root logins via ssh (as noted above by bbb).<p>2. Move ssh port from port 22 to something nonstandard. According to my logs, the number of idiots who try brute-force attacks on my machines dropped from 4/day to 0.<p>3. Put an iptables script into /etc/init.d and make sure it runs on startup at the normal multiuser run levels (on Debian, the command is something like /sbin/update-rc.d, but I don't remember exactly). I looked into more sophisticated firewall packages which generate iptables rules, but found them rather complicated, and probably overkill (YMMV). I essentially blocked all incoming traffic except on the nonstandard ssh port and ports 80 and 443.<p>Services which use ports other than 80, 443, and ssh should run on a privately routed network, or, at minimum, on a separate network interface with draconian access rules. iptables is pretty easy to use once for this stuff you get the hang of it.",1206320269

""please tell me what you think about x for my project"" ""Could you do an interview for y?""). These messages should get the lowest priority and could even be deleted if they can't be answered within a week or two.<p>The next set of emails are of mutual benefit to the sender and receiver (such as conversations between clients and companies, friends to friends, and <i>productive</i> internal corporate communication).<p>The final category is emails for the receiver's sole benefit.

I limit myself to global ""find""; even doing global replacements cautiously, one by one.<p>I think it's because I can't imagine a tool being able to handle all the ""quality"" aspects of large scale code changes.  For example, a symbol browser might not see #ifdef'd-out blocks; a parser may find references to X in code but not in comments; and aesthetics like proper indentation may be lost.  In other words, if I let a robot ""fix"" things and move on, I may be burned down the road by confusing code or comments.<p>Are there good refactoring tools that I've just missed?  How do you handle major code changes?",1206319065

Applications of these are storing passwords (e.g. normally you should salt and hash passwords before storing them in a database)  SHA is usually stronger (~160 bits) than md5 (~128 bits).

This does not mean that <i>you</i> (or all entrepreneurs) have a 2/3 chance to making it to millionaire, but that millionaires have a 2/3 chance of being an entrepreneur. The question to ask yourself is how many entrepreneurs <i>aren't</i> millionaires? What if 9/10 entrepreneurs go bankrupt? The decision is not quite as easy as the author makes it out to be. Maybe only 1/3 millionaires are royalty, but 9/10 of royalty are millionaires. It makes more sense to be the 1/3 royalty than the 2/3 entrepreneurs. Your odds are better.

He's played on thousands of albums, and while he has played in bands, he's just too busy as a very in-demand session player to be playing live constantly.  He rarely does anything even remotely like a ""tour"".  If I want to hear Abraham play, the easiest way is through a recording.<p>Even more extremely, recordings can bring together musicians in a way that would be implausible to do live.  If you enjoy the music of musicians A, B, C, and D, all of whom have their own career as a musician, it might be very rare to hear them all play together live, just due to their schedules.  But get them together for a week, either in a studio or on a stage, and you can make an awesome recording that captures something rarely heard in person.<p>The model of ""recordings are marketing tools for live performances"" is not necessarily bad or wrong, but I don't think it applies in every instance.",1206317335

The guy's statements always forwarded an agenda of diminishing the value of individual excellence and achievements in favor of fitting into the popular mode.  If a talented architect not under his sanction dared to showcase his work, Toohey would use his influence to shut him down.  In context, what he said always sounded insightful, but when you stepped back, you realized how scary his statements were.  A quick search yielded this Toohey quote, for example, that falls in line with the theme:<p>""Artistic value is achieved collectively by each man subordinating himself to the standards of the majority.""<p>The Arrington quote was so evocative because Toohey could personally create popularity and buzz, so he'd literally say something as self-serving as ""the supposed greatness of an architect's building is irrelevant . . . the question is, are people [like me] talking about it?""<p>To be absolutely clear:  <i>I am not comparing Mike Arrington to Ellsworth Toohey.</i>  What I am saying is that the sentence, as worded, could definitely be a line from one of the latter's monologues.",1206317096

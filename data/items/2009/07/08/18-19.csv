I get that it has interesting bells and whistles, but I think the search results are incredibly naive.<p>For example, when I search for my company I get 7 pages of results that are pages I host. Then finally at the end of page seven there are links to our TechCrunch and TradeVibes pages. I think having some diversity of results is important.",1247079554

The American political system is broken, and it's high time we apply our hacker creativity and startup ingenuity to reverse the rising tide of ignorance and apathy that threatens to sweep away any remaining semblance of informed, rational political discourse in the United States.<p>The Simplevote website doesn't explain many of the details; I'm still working those out. There are a myriad of potential objections and pitfalls; some of them are easily mitigated, some less so. Please ask questions and point out shortcomings in this idea; feel equally free to suggest solutions.<p>I'm an entrepreneur and web developer by expertise; I'm currently the founder of InQuickER, which was discussed here a few months ago. Ultimately, I may not be the person to spearhead this concept and push it forward over the next couple of years, and I'm perfectly fine with that. However, I think it's time for this idea to become reality, and I can't help but commit my time and money to getting the idea off the ground.<p>What do you think of this?",1247079298

It's sad that the BBC is continuing along this path despite the original reason for it... browser support... being a moot issue at this point.  The JS world would be better off if they abandoned their support of their internal library and instead focused on using, supporting, and extending one of the existing open-source libraries.<p>jQuery is so open to user development and its plugin architecture lends itself nicely to the BBC team being able to add any functionality they feel is missing.

There are a lot of smaller user groups in situations that prevent them from upgrading too. You'd be surprised how many older machine users this equates to. Thus the BBC has to support the thin end of the wedge of web browsers, and the stats we have (unfortunately) back this up.<p>The Glow team itself is actually a very small team, even in BBC terms (which usually has small teams compared to a lot of companies).

So you post a few other links here and there, but you are consistently self promoting Windy Citizen.  Windy Citizen is no different than Examiner.  It's all crap on the surface with a few writers who may occasionally produce an interesting article.<p>You then go on to gripe about what an injustice Examiner is when you publish a website that is basically the exact same thing as the Examiner, if not worse?  I am not delusional.  Examiner sucks.  But coming from you it's quite ironic.<p>Furthermore, isn't the point of social media sites that the creme rises to the top and the crap sinks?  That's the whole idea of voting.  I've had several articles rise quickly and get a lot of votes.  I've had some sink because they are crap.  If I hadn't had some that were successful, I would stop posting my links here.  But the truth is that posting my links on this site has been rather successful because I've had some articles gain a lot of votes.<p>Also, your facts on how much Examiner pays are completely off.  Examiner pays $0.01 per click.  That's $10 per 1,000 and I earn $1500 a month writing around 15-20 articles.  It seems that some people want to read my stuff.  So why do you take it upon yourself to police the site when there are others who actually enjoyed the article?  7 people voted it up because they liked it.  Having to promote my own articles isn't something I gripe about.  I'm not an entitled journalist.  I'm a guy that works in a cube that makes money on the side by occasionally humoring people.<p>Perhaps it is inconceivable to you that someone could like reading something that you don't like.",1247076856

Not just useful to curious web surfers, but also for market research and business-collaborative purposes.<p>The one constructive critique I would offer at this stage is just to continue to work on simplifying your text, both in terms of wordage and visual presentation.

MS added VBA support back to Mac Office 2011, but VBA can only do so much. On Windows, sophisticated Office plug-ins are typically COM add-ins, which can be implemented in C++ or .NET and thus can pretty much do anything you want. Those are obviously not cross-platform, though. I believe Mac Office also supports AppleScript, but it's not clear to me whether that's any more powerful than VBA.",1290459511

Steve had a rule that there could never be more than one hundred people on the Mac team. So if you wanted to add someone you had to take someone out. And the thinking was a typical Steve Jobs observation: “I can’t remember more than a hundred first names so I only want to be around people that I know personally. So if it gets bigger than a hundred people, it will force us to go to a different organization structure where I can’t work that way. The way I like to work is where I touch everything.” Through the whole time I knew him at Apple that’s exactly how he ran his division.</i><p>Link to the full article:

I bet that, rather, the minority position is that the instructor should create whatever conditions they want to so that they can exercise the students as they see fit - and that the students should extend enough respect to consider why those conditions are being created.  This is my view.<p>Replace the teacher with a coach in a weightlifting class.  One day he wants you to lift some freeweights, but he wants you to lift them in a particular way that does not use your legs.  (Let's say he's having you do ""military presses"".)  ""Nonsense!"" says the modern student, who already knows that it's best to lift heavy things with their legs.  ""Why shouldn't I be able to use this awesome resource (my legs) that's right here at my disposal!?""<p>Well maybe - just maybe - the coach wants to target your deltoids.  Hmmm.<p>Enter Professor Luis von Ahn, who wants you to do homework without using google.  Perhaps that is because he doesn't want you to target and improve your research abilities.  It could be that, rather, he would like you to exercise and sculpt your ability to work problems from first principles.  The professor may be aware that practice makes permanent, and homework is intended to get students to strengthen specific things, and that taking the easy way out robs the student of the intended benefit.<p>That's how I approach being a student, and so I grant that when sensei says wax-on, paint-uh-fence, and sand-uh-flo that he's got some idea of what I should be working on.  But that's an old, old attitude that exists only in a handful of Hollywood movies these days.  So that's why I'm betting you're actually in the majority.<p>By the way, the instructor here is an awesome guy.

Since you were challenging a legitimate move you would roll the two red dice and the defender would roll the three white ones. Whoever had the higher total would win. This meant that if you put the other player in check you still had to actually capture the king because they could challenge the actual capture and keep the game going.<p>I think that if you lost the roll not only did you have to take your move back but you lost your turn as well.

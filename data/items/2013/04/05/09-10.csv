The ""running background tasks in the foreground"" is a good example; one that I _hate_ seeing in production.<p>The thing that I don't agree with though, is that you've described a ""capable"" programmer who uses good programming techniques and obviously knows how to structure an application. If this programmer is doing the ""background-in-foreground"" thing and hasn't heard of message queues, then I would argue that they aren't a capable programmer - in which case you're just describing bad programming practices; not a fundamental flaw of PHP.",1365155932

Again, it's measure temperature not with thermometers in degrees F, C, or K but with pictures of glaciers.<p>Yes, it's a morality play, human sin, this time via CO2.<p>And it's a trilogy -- transgression, retribution, and redemption.  The transgression is the CO2 from human sin.  The retribution is over heating the planet, as in glaciers melting.  And the redemption?  Sure, sacrifice, this time, a carbon tax to reverse much of the industrial revolution.<p>So, it's the old methods of fiction, e.g., morality plays, going back at least 1000 years.  The NYT is good at writing morality plays.<p>Of course, one of the NYT people on this bandwagon is their Tom Friedman.  On a talk show, he explained his view of the problem of CO2:  He said that it absorbs light from the sun and, thus, heats the atmosphere.<p>Okay, let's check:  Let's exhale, look at the little cloud of air with the extra CO2, and see if we can see any sunlight absorbed?  Or, let's get some CO2 from some other sources and see if it looks darker because of the light it absorbs instead of transmits.  Nope, we don't see anything.  So, right, CO2 doesn't absorb sunlight.<p>So, what does CO2 absorb?  It absorbs in three narrow frequency bands out in the infrared, one band for each of bending, twisting, and stretching of the molecule.<p>So, how, then, is CO2 a 'green house' gas?  Because light from the sun is absorbed by the surface of the earth which, then, radiates roughly as a Planck 'black body' and, thus, radiates mostly in the infrared, and CO2 in the atmosphere absorbs some of the infrared, in those three narrow bands, instead of just letting it continue to radiate outward and be absorbed by water vapor, methane, or something else or just escape into space.<p>But there is CO2 in the atmosphere even without the human 'sin' of the industrial revolution, and it's not clear that more CO2 in the atmosphere will absorb more in those three narrow bands than now -- that is, it may be that all the infrared that CO2 can absorb is being absorbed now.<p>Someday, maybe, we will have news sources better informed than the NYT and, then, using expository techniques 1000 years closer to the present, from the 20th century and maybe even the 21st century.<p>From an article like this, I would cancel my subscription to the NYT but I can't:  I've never subscribed to the NYT, rarely read it on-line, and have never read it on-line since their 'pay-wall'.  They used to call me and ask me to subscribe, but I told them that my kitty cats prefer kitty litter or the bushes in the back yard and that I don't have any dead fish to wrap.<p>The NYT may be on the way out of business.

The money grows (hopefully ahead of inflation) by being used to fuel growth. Savings that are not invested slowly lose value, a good incentive to either invest or spend and keep everything flowing.<p>Hoarding BTC is much the same as stuffing cash into a mattress, it's totally unproductive. A currency that rewards hoarders is not useful.<p>Also this is not a left-right issue. You'll find many on the right who are in favour of a small, controlled amount of inflation.",1365153048

We were prepared for a ""quick rush"" but when the details were released we did a combination of nmap to look for any accidentally exposed Postgres installs + adding explicit firewall rules to reject all traffic on the related ports (all of them should be rejected by default rules anyway, but we wanted to ensure none of the ports had been accidentally opened up) ""just in case"", and at that point we felt we could take a slower, more measured roll out of the upgrade. In 5 minutes we were ""in the clear"" and could breathe a sigh of relief.<p>It's still important to apply the udates, as I wrote elsewhere, because it's one more way someone can mess you up badly if they have managed to penetrate other parts of our systems, but upgrades no matter how seemingly safe can also cause problems (fore example I test upgraded one VM that refused to come back up again afterwards - not Postgres' fault, but a config change someone had clearly not tested properly).<p>But in this case, knowing we have blocked the main attack vector means we can take the time to take a copy of each database VM we run, test apply the upgrade and verify everything works correctly before applying it live, instead of rushing it out.",1365152865

Its seems like a perfect solution for the CIA when they need to move money quickly and discretely to 'difficult' regions or individuals.<p>I know that Gavin Andresen (unofficial leader of Bitcoin movement) did a talk for the CIA in 2011. But I dont know if their interest was about catching bad guys, using it for themselves or seeking to control/manipulate bitcoin: <a href=""http://www.bitcointrading.com/pdf/GavinAndresenCIATalk.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.bitcointrading.com/pdf/GavinAndresenCIATalk.pdf</a><p>So I think an interesting question is whether these same agencies are generating bitcoins or attempting to manipulate the market. The big news recently for Bitcoin is the introduction of ASIC hardware dedicated to mining. An ASIC miner the size of a PC can generate bitcoin hashes 100x faster than a GPU at approximately the same power usage.<p>ASIC miners have taken a while to hit the market because making an ASIC is hard and expensive for a small company. You can bet they didnt get funding from a brick and mortar bank. There are only a couple of companies with a shippable product.<p>But surely making this same hardware is a relatively trivial exercise for a nation state, particularly the NSA who run their own fab and would be experts at making silicon tuned for crypto algorithms.<p>Thoughts?",1365152688

Very similar to bitcoin but with faster transactions, and it uses a different algorithm. Using Scrypt instead of SHA-256 makes it much harder to get a fast FPGA or ASIC to mine quickly. Even top graphics cards are no more than 10-20x faster than CPUs. It's risen in price ridiculously recently, going from 7 cents to 6 dollars, now hovering around 4. People who were mining or bought in around the 7 cent mark have made quite a lot. There was no premining thought which is interesting, and I think has helped raise confidence (pre-mining is where the designers of the currency mine on their own before anyone else gets on the network, so it's a concern that they will dump vast amounts at some point and crash the price).<p>I think having more currencies might actually improve confidence, as there are a few ways of looking at it:<p>1) Lots popping up, hmm, bitcoin isn't special so SELL!<p>2) Lots popping up and falling, hmm, bitcoin looks quite stable comparatively, BUY!<p>3) Another few stable ones appearing, hmm, crypto-currencies looks like quite a normal idea, BUY!<p>Could go any way, could all collapse or spike. Maybe $125 is low for bitcoin, and we'll be here thinking ""Why didn't I buy in?"" or it'll collapse, nobody will think it's worth mining and the network will fall apart. Or it'll remain the same.<p>All I know is I'm currently making some money to keep my flat warm, and that it's not worth putting in anything I can't afford to lose.<p>Edit - Formatting.",1365152638

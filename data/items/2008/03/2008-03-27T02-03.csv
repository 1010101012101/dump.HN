(Notice the link at the top of the page links to revzilla.com (my site), sometimes it swaps to an amazon.com product so just refresh that page if it does)<p>Apparently someone had created a mechanical turk which is paying people to reword / paraphrase our product descriptions (I assume) for use on their competing website.  We can't be having that so I added a simple rule to redirect any Mechanical Turk referrers to http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBGIQ7ZuuiU :D",1206586037
147510,comment,147266,147378,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"We applied at the last minute...the same day they were due, and with only a half an hour or so of work on the app (I applied on a whim...didn't even tell my co-founder until after).  I don't know how it effects the odds, but we did get the interview (and I think that's also the point at which I informed my co-founder that I'd applied).  I'm guessing it probably doesn't matter.  At the end of WFP07, I seem to recall that they waited until the apps were all in before printing them out and looking them over.<p>I do suggest writing well, however, and taking as long as you need to achieve that goal.",1206585784

So every day you wait, you're losing time.<p>As long as your idea isn't very complicated to implement, and you know what you want; by all means, use an elance or a rentacoder or a craigslist.",1206585567

7096967,comment,7095357,7095939,13,0,Zancarius,,,"I really like this detailed write up. A certain large company in Mountain View suggested years ago that they had collected a great deal of metrics on consumer grade hard disks performing in a data center capacity, but refused to publish the data.<p>The fact that Backblaze isn&#x27;t embarrassed to share this with the rest of this gives me the warm fuzzies. Thanks for the hard work!<p>I recently purchased a new Seagate, and I&#x27;m feeling a bit of buyer&#x27;s remorse. That&#x27;s not to say this article triggered the feeling completely (though it did push me over the edge). Taking this information and the knowledge that recent model Barracudas appear to have aggressive APM that loads/unloads the heads after a minute or so of inactivity (unless disabled, but it doesn&#x27;t persist between reboots) AND seems to borrow from laptop-grade design... I think I&#x27;d be better off replacing it. Again. ;)<p>I wonder if the poor longevity of Seagate drives is due to changes in quality control or design? I have older ones that don&#x27;t utilize the APM load/unload features and are still running fine after many years. Then again, they were also pre-flood drives.<p>I&#x27;d also be curious to know if there&#x27;s a correlation with where the drive was manufactured and its survival rate, though I suspect that might be a much more difficult metric to collect.",1390327187

Her first name is Silicon and her last name is Valley. I’m not sure why I believed you for so long, but you lied to me. You told me Tech City is the next Silicon Valley, and it isn’t. You told me you were going to lead the UK out of a slump and you didn’t. I wanted edgy. I wanted mobile. I wanted hip. I wanted cool. You were boring, conservative, and expensive. So what did I do? I left. I left you because my new girlfriend knows how to support me.<p>Ignoring the painful rhetoric here, Tech City is not going to be the next Silicon Valley, and nobody said it would be. You thought the global economic recession&#x27;s impact on London, the financial capital of the world, would be lessened by the government putting ten people in an office and asking them to talk about startups? I&#x27;m not sure what the output was which you were expecting from this input, but it&#x27;s clear that you were misguided. Maybe you think SVASE is going to help the homeless in San Francisco?<p>London is expensive. A bit cheaper than SF, though. Boring and conservative? Make grand plans and I think you&#x27;ll find people willing to back you. We did.<p>> When we launched our MVP in march my thoughts were “yes, let’s be part of this tech city revolution”. My thoughts now, “What revolution?”<p>I&#x27;ve run a venture-backed startup in London for nearly 3 years. I also think &quot;what tech city revolution?&quot; because a common hallmark of the successful / venture-backed startups in the UK (you seem to conflate the two) is that they don&#x27;t really go in for the bullshit: networking, accelerators where you get a communal office and access to a shitty lawyer, ec. The good startups in the UK don&#x27;t obsess over Tech City News or go to networking events with cold pizza and warm white wine. They work out whether there&#x27;s an opportunity in a market, raise capital, and build things.<p>> Without sounding completely derogatory – London’s tech startup scene is very amateurish.<p>I&#x27;ve read your article a couple of times and I&#x27;m still not clear on what facets strike you as amateurish.<p>> the developer talent isn’t exactly amateur. For example, take a stroll into a TechHub campus or the Innovation Warehouse and it’s buzzing.<p>I&#x27;m not sure that the &quot;buzz&quot; of an engineer is the best way to evaluate his or her amateur/pro status. If you want to assess software engineers, you need to meet them and work with them. Also, you&#x27;re again talking about going into incubators and shared offices to assess the health of companies in a city. A bit weird.<p>> I met a number of young and hungry developers, technical and online savvy who struggled to find good companies to work for.<p>That&#x27;s odd: I know at least one YC company in addition to us who find it very hard to find great software engineers. We&#x27;re constantly advertising positions and recruiting through our networks. <i>Whenever</i> I speak to other venture-backed companies the biggest challenge is finding talent. Not all engineers are created equally.<p>For established world class talent the attraction has traditionally been San Francisco, whether you&#x27;re in Europe or America. But look at people like Nikolaj Nyholm: built a fantastic software company (which now powers facial recognition in most of Apple&#x27;s products), sold it, and now back in Europe working with startups.<p>> Here in SV, that match is almost nearly always met. I even met a women tech founder, yes one of this “pink” unicorns SV is biting it’s hands off to use as a poster child, who lacked a support network.<p>Trying to decrypt this sentence. You met a female founder in SV, or in the UK? What &quot;support network&quot; was she lacking?<p><pre><code>  > The bottom line is this – the right people aren’t leading the pack. I’m not suggesting a personal nomination, but it was still clear there aren’t enough of the right people in the system. Could have I waited it out and became one of those people? Sure, but one thing you learn in tech is that time is not on your side.\n\n   This is so muddled. What are you saying, exactly?\n</code></pre>\n> One of the foundations of Silicon Valley is its strong angel investing community and large amounts of high net worths.<p>At last, something we can all agree with!<p>> As far as I am concerned this community doesn’t exist in London.<p>Simply put this is wrong. London&#x27;s major problem is that startups have become more popular and readily accessible due to a stronger proclivity to invest at the seed stage amongst people in the financial services. If you cannot raise £150k for your startup&#x27;s seed round in London, you&#x27;re doing something wrong.<p>The big challenge has been at the seed through to Series A stage. Because of a lack of major institutions in the UK with large funds, the institutional backers tend towards later stage deals. A few are actively correcting that and one or two great funds have sprung up to specifically tackle this problem (Profounder, Hoxton Ventures, Passion), but the challenge is the same: because there isn&#x27;t competition in the funds, only in the startups, there&#x27;s less likely to be money trickling down to riskier ventures and those who are between seed and Series A.<p>> Are there high net worth individuals in tech investing in companies in London? Yes, but as a whole, it is neither the correct group nor right number of people to become critical mass.<p>There should be some kind of rule against asking yourself easy questions so you can look like a genius in a blog post. There are a great many HNWI and UHNWIs in London.<p>The good point you veer towards making but manage to miss, is that there aren&#x27;t the high number of $1bn exits in Europe which lead to HNWIs with tech backgrounds investing in companies. I agree with that. But I&#x27;ve also found that there are some, and they&#x27;re interested in hearing from credible entrepreneurs.<p>I got bored of the rest of this but here&#x27;s my tl;dr:<p>1. Yes there are good reasons to found a startup in San Francisco and not in London.\n2. There are also good reasons to found a startup in London and not San Francisco (another topic for a different time).\n3. I believe that if you truly have a disruptive idea and the capacity to make it happen, you will not have a problem raising capital. But it tends to be at the higher end of the spectrum (£1bn+ idea) that you will have an easier time raising.<p>I wish you well in San Francisco but I don&#x27;t think London was the problem here. I think you had mismanaged expectations. Feel free to ping me if you want to meet for a coffee next time you&#x27;re in London so we can compare notes on SF vs. London -- address is in profile.",1390326916

Apple chooses to focus on a few well made product lines rather than a shotgun blast of different variants for every budget and market segment.

I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;ll come as a surprise to anyone that Silicon Valley is the best place in the world to do a tech startup. The eco-system there has had decades to develop and grow, while London&#x27;s is still in its infancy. Silicon Valley&#x27;s tradition of the benficiaries of IPOs re-investing their new-found wealth into tech startups stretches back to Mike Markkula&#x27;s investment in Apple, while there are still relatively few British angels. And the &quot;What&#x27;s in it for me?&quot; attitude prevalent in London stands in marked contrast to Silicon Valley&#x27;s collaborative, &quot;Pay-It-Forward&quot; culture. London is also hampered by government attempts to &quot;help&quot; (i.e. take the credit for) the tech industry that is often inept and, at times, cronyistic.<p>But I wouldn&#x27;t give up on London. It takes time for eco-systems to grow and mature. London&#x27;s tech startup scene may well be amateurish but it&#x27;s also incubating world-class companies like Mind Candy, Huddle, King.com and Spotify. Silicon Valley-based startups are coming to London to acqui-hire companies like CrashPadder and Lightbox.<p>London&#x27;s already the best place in the world to start a company in certain segments (e.g. fin.tech) and it&#x27;s often the first choice for companies looking to establish their first international office.<p>And it&#x27;s going to keep getting better because there are people here who want to see it get better.<p>Thanks Michael, your feedback is appreciated.

Lenovo has its T series laptops, which are close to the Macbook Pro. They have the X series, which are close to the Macbook Air.

First iPad was called the iPad.  Awesome start.  The second, the iPad 2 ... even better.  The third was not the iPad 3 but rather the iPad ... or the &quot;all new ipad&quot; aka 3rd generation.  Starting to lose it a bit here but let&#x27;s trust Apple.  The iPad 4 was not the iPad 4 but actually the iPad ... with retina display/4th generation.  Ok so maybe we&#x27;re starting a new naming scheme?  Good then.  The 5th generation iPad is/was called the iPad 5th Gen... oh wait no it&#x27;s called the iPad Air.<p>To top it off, the 3rd and 4th generations are discontinued, leaving the iPad 2 and the iPad Air as the only available models.  Try explaining that to a non-Apple following family member and watch their face contort.<p>Now I did RTFA and was amazed at how the author could spin the atrocious naming scheme for the iPad into something that matched his hypothesis. Kudos to him for sticking with it.<p>This snippet taken directly from the article could almost prove my point<p>&quot;The original iPad hit store shelves in April of 2010, soon followed by the iPad 2, which was released in March of 2011. When the third-generation iPad was released in March of 2012, Apple by and large decided to forgo the numeric naming scheme and instead advertised the device simply as the all-new iPad.<p>Instead of a scenario with the original iPad, the iPad 2 and iPad 3 floating around, Apple kicked numerical suffixes to the side and started anew. When the fourth-gen iPad was released, Apple, again, didn&#x27;t refer to it as the iPad 4. Rather, it often began referring to it as the iPad with Retina display.&quot;",1390326226

First of all, container isn&#x27;t used like that (you don&#x27;t want to wrap your entire content in one container -- maybe you want a different full-width background for your header vs your body, for example).  Secondly, this technique is exactly what I was describing -- using mixins (or @extend) in your CSS to eliminate the redundant classes.<p>Still, your final output produces three levels of DOM, which was exactly what my point was.  No matter how much you try to export your grid code into your CSS (and you should try!), you will <i>always</i> run into situations where you need that <div class=&quot;row&quot;> and there will be no way to semantically handle that.<p>Furthermore, there are some limitations even when combining semantic elements that cause issues.  For instance, I often write this code:<p><pre><code>  <div class=&quot;row well&quot;> \n</code></pre>\nTo find that the exact margin/padding values I want for my well interfere with the default padding/margin values provided by row defaults.

If you watch the full interview with Zane Lowe[0], aka the interview that Jimmy Kimmel made fun of and started a whole firestorm over, you realize (if you haven&#x27;t before) that Kanye sees bringing beauty to others as the penultimate goal in life (you could argue he values his family a bit more). In a sense I think that&#x27;s what most people who get into startups, or really just &quot;hacking&quot; in general, want to do. Create. Bring beauty. Improve the world in a small way. Leave it better than how you got it, as my dad used to say.<p>Kanye has also gone through some of the exact trials and tribulations that people trying to start a business go through. If you listen to his song Spaceship[1] from &quot;College Dropout&quot; (his <i>debut</i> album) you can really hear the same kind of ethos as he tries to break into the music business while working at the Gap:<p>>> Taking my hits, writing my hits\n>> Writing my rhymes, playing my mind\n>> This f<i></i>king job can&#x27;t help him\n>> So I quit, y&#x27;all welcome\n>> Y&#x27;all don&#x27;t know my struggle\n>> Y&#x27;all can&#x27;t match my hustle\n>> You can&#x27;t catch my hustle\n>> You can&#x27;t fathom my love dude\n>> Lock yourself in a room doing 5 beats a day for 3 summers\n>> That&#x27;s a Different World like Cree Summer&#x27;s<p>I&#x27;m cherry picking a quote, and it might lose it&#x27;s umph because of that, but besides the undeniable poetic like quality of his words (is my fanboy showing yet?) you can see the dedication, and the repetition he puts into his craft. This is directly applicable to those trying to get a startup off the ground; You need hard work and most of all you need to <i>ship</i>, and keep on <i>shipping</i> to perfect your product. In fact, when I was trying to get my first startup going I more or less listened to this song on repeat as motivation, because Kanye understands the self-doubt. He understands the constant pressure to succumb to social standards. He understands that people push back when you try and break out. In fact, Kanye probably knows this more than most of us, as a person of color. Yet even through all of this Ye still succeeds. In fact, (it could be argued) the massive amount of people who don&#x27;t like Kanye are more a testament to his success than the people who do. But it doesn&#x27;t just stop at music. For those who weren&#x27;t aware, Kanye started off as a producer and against a lot of pressure to stay a producer became a rapper as well. One of my favorite Kanye songs isn&#x27;t really a song, but a narrative of how he overcame this and got signed in &quot;Last Call&quot;[2]. As per the same BBC interview I referenced above, Kanye is trying to break into fashion, architecture, design, a myriad of industries using the same ideas and work ethic. Work hard, and make something &quot;dope&quot;, while disregarding the way &quot;things are done around here&quot; (to complete the analogy for those less aware of the rap scene, Kanye was one of the founders of &quot;backpack rap&quot;, a kind of suburban, every day, introspective way of rapping, as opposed to the massively popular &quot;gangsta rap&quot; of the day).<p>Beyond all of that one of Kanye&#x27;s biggest messages throughout his music is that the message of &quot;Stay in your place&quot; is wrong. He is consistently trying to upset the status quo. This is a message that should reverberate among any of us trying to shake up an established industry, or trying to create a market that simply didn&#x27;t exist before. Kanye sees what is &quot;not cool&quot; in the world and tries to fix that, whether it&#x27;s jumping up on stage and proclaiming on live tv that Taylor Swift doesn&#x27;t deserve an award, or using shoe design as a way to break the race barrier in fashion. He&#x27;s just as much a hacker as any one of us who works with code or hardware.<p>Kanye also sacrifices for his art. He paid millions out of his own pocket (back before he was financially set, I might add) to produce his own music videos for &quot;Jesus Walks&quot;, after the studios wouldn&#x27;t go with the direction as he wanted. I can&#x27;t pin down the quote right now, but I recall him saying something to the effect of &quot;If that album [Late Registration] wasn&#x27;t a success I would have been broke&quot;. As we all know &quot;Jesus Walks&quot; became a #1 hit, Kanye got his videos on MTV, and the album went triple platinum. He continues to shell out of his own pocket for tours (that consistently succeed far past expectations) and runs his own design company, DONDA. Rumor has it he is financing his stylist&#x27;s new clothing line. Just because it&#x27;s not software doesn&#x27;t mean he&#x27;s not a VC.<p>This might not be the most lucid post, as I&#x27;m typing rather frantically in order to get this out before the story drops off the front page, but tl;dr: Kanye West exemplifies the hacker spirit, and learning from someone who has succeeded so immensely as a creative person can&#x27;t be the worst thing you can do.<p>[0]: <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DR_yTQ0SYVA"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DR_yTQ0SYVA</a>\n[1]: <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGM6N0qXeu4"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGM6N0qXeu4</a>\n[2]: <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q602739kBr4"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q602739kBr4</a>",1390324914

B is willing to sell A his land for $500.  A agrees and they engage in the transaction.  After the transaction, A <i>lost</i> $500, but <i>gained</i> $500 worth of land so A still has $1000 of property.  B <i>lost</i> $500 worth of land, but gained <i>$500</i> in cash.<p>So before the transaction, each has $1000 of property (cash + land), and after the transaction, each still has $1000 worth of property (cash + land).  It&#x27;s just been shuffled a bit based on what each actor desired and what they were willing to pay for what they wanted.<p>In general, LOTS of transactions in the real world work this way, i.e., actors engage in the transaction to result in a net increase (perceived) of value to themselves.  So the simulation is unrealistic in that respect: it assumes transactions in which one party <i>loses</i> are just as likely (if not more likely) than those in which the transaction only occurs if both parties win.  In the real world, most transactions occur only if both parties feel the trade is a fair exchange of value (no net loss to either side).",1390324514

I think the UK has to learn to create an entrepreneurial style of our own and not attempt to transplant something from another culture - two countries separated by a common language etc.  There was a post recently on how codified the startup process appears to be getting (sorry couldn&#x27;t find it) which I think also hints at the problem.<p>Whilst the UK has had it&#x27;s moments - remember when Acorn and Sinclair ruled the bedroom? - we often revert to the enthusiastic amateur, responsible for the breakthrough but never quite capitalising on it.  Indeed Mike uses the word <i>amateurish</i> in describing the scene himself.  Also I get the impression that both for cultural and legal reasons the hire-and-fire approach to staffing doesn&#x27;t happen in the UK which might be a necessary component in establishing an available pool of talent with the right risk mindset.  We are also a terribly cynical bunch here in the UK which isn&#x27;t the ideal frame of mind.<p>For the record, I&#x27;m a UK developer working for tech startups in Manchester which is 200 miles north of London (that&#x27;s regarded as a long way in England) and all of the above is personal conjecture based on 45 years of being a cynical, amateur Londoner who got lost in The North and never went home.",1390324302

I plan to hack one out for Firefox and friends in the future, too.<p>My approach is fairly simplistic right now (hooks into Chrome&#x27;s extension installation and disables a blacklisted extension as soon as it&#x27;s installed, updated, or recognized after a database update), but as I&#x27;m digging more into these nasty extensions, I&#x27;m seeing some patterns in the DOM injection that I&#x27;m also going to watch for separately.  So, while an extension block list will catch the dumb extension owners or those who sell to adware companies, the more sophisticated analysis of the DOM and watching for script/load requests to certain domains should at least alert the user to the presence of certain adware (even if I can&#x27;t track down exactly which extension may be causing it).<p>But I need your help!  The database of malware extensions and malware-peddling domains that powers this whole thing lives over at https://github.com/extensionwatch/database.  I need you all to help me fill in the current crop of evil extensions and adware dispensing domains.  The database will live in this repository, be built using a Rake task, and deployed to users of the extension.  The idea is to have a completely open and collaborative repository of this stuff to alleviate a lot of the (justified) &quot;who&#x27;s watching the watchers&quot; paranoia.<p>Anyhow, feel free to file issues on either of those repositories to start discussions.

These indirect costs are used to cover the cost of facilities, maintenance and all the little bits that no one ever thinks about. No one buys a piece of equipment expecting there to be no maintenance whatsoever. These indirect costs are always governed by an agreed-upon rate set between the host institution and the funding entity. The federal government in particular has very clearly spelled out rules regarding this. For example - the grant that funds my work right now has a very clearly legislated indirect cost rate of 8%. If our indirect costs exceed that 8% monthly, we can lose our funding.<p>Now where we get into the part where you&#x27;re not 100% accurate, and I believe being a bit inflammatory is the triple dipping. Institutions can get a grant to purchase equipment, and then charge the same grant for the use of the equipment. The institution can charge for the personnel hours that run the equipment on related projects, they can charge that indirect cost that we discussed earlier, but that&#x27;s about it. It&#x27;s not as if they can just make up a number and charge the government that much to use the equipment for related projects. There are circulars from the Office of Management and Budget that dictate what you can and can&#x27;t do with your money - for example, colleges and universities have to adhere to the cost principles outlined in OMB A-21, available here: <a href=""http://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/circulars_a021_2004"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/circulars_a021_2004</a> if you want some light reading.<p>On top of the basic OMB circulars, all federal grants have additional legislation that add further stipulations to how money can be spent, but come from any number of 1000 sources, so I&#x27;m not going to cite them. Anyway, the institution cannot just charge the government for use of the equipment.<p>Secondly - they are not paid &#x27;overhead&#x27; for making the equipment available. They are paid an indirect cost rate to maintain, store and generally keep the facility running for grants. This rate is very clearly spelled out in any grant documents. I&#x27;ve not seen 60+% in any grant I&#x27;ve ever worked with. In smaller institutions they tend to be around 10-20%. On the larger campuses, the average indirect rate was 32%.<p>Anyone familiar with the finances know that there are legislation and regulation in place to dictate all of this, and while it may be convoluted, it&#x27;s really not as predatory as you make it out to be.",1390323767

This makes upgrading the gem (or plain source files) rather simple. But sure, you might have to check if anything was renamed or added.<p>But with overriding you do not only create redundant, unnecessary styles (and bytes), but if you now upgrade your bootstrap files as you suggest, you also have to change your overrides - which depending on the amount of changes you did will be significantly more work (and &#x27;mental gymnastics&#x27;) - if changes were introduced.<p>So you gain very little (less setup effort) but lose quite a lot.",1390323733

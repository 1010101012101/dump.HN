Since these games are written for android a port will probably be a complete rewrite (see minecraft for x-box), and take a year at least.<p>Why wait a year to play a game when you can get access for only $99?<p>Sure eventually console makers might make tools and processes to make it easier for indie developers to get android games onto their consoles, but that would be fantastic (and would accomplish the goals of this project anyway).",1341942943

They seem to have been won over by popularity effects and performance/cool tech factors.<p>So, if github fails, it may not really be as big of an issue. Github could fail as an investment or company, and still leave a running system behind, up as a non-profit even; the risk to its customers doesn't seem that big.

There seems to be no way to first select all the files to restore and them have them restored in one action.<p>I've had similar lost files situations, such a setting up a new machine, where dropbox mistook an empty folder as the most current state and proceeded to delete things from other machines.<p>Whether or not this is what one should expect given the circumstances, or if these mishaps could be avoided with some care, it's still a little too easy to lose things. My fear is something will vanish and I won't realize it until it's too late to restore it.<p>The Dropbox Web site offers an RSS feed for your account activity.  I've taken to watching this to see if there's any unexpected deletion going on.  I've half a mind to write some cron thing that filters the feed for deletions and alerts me somehow.<p>Downside to this is that Dropbox has a way of updating files by deleting what's there and then adding back a newer version.   Perhaps I just need an RSS feed of deletions that I scan periodically or check when I've done something potentially dangerous (like restore a drive or VM or something).<p>Makes me wonder if there's a business in here, helping people safeguard (select) Dropbox content.",1341942846

Dollar figures are almost meaningless as this is just one small part of the whole picture.<p>One of the best pieces of advice I have ever heard regarding offering development services is that the technical skills are easy to pick up, it's the people skills which are difficult.  It's the people skills that buyers are willing to pay for if they have the budget.  These cheap developers aren't able to connect with the people skills, so they aren't able to break out of their low cost offerings.  Instead, they might work for a middle-man who handles the client for a mint and hands off the work for cheap.<p>Also, if developers on Odesk racking up 5 star ratings are so great, then why don't companies such as Github and 37Signals with mostly remote teams just go snap up all the 5 star developers they can find on Odesk?  The reason is that there is a big gap between A-level developers and C-level developers and that gap is measured in ROI.  Dollar amounts mean nothing, ROI is the most important number.  A 5 star developer working cheaply on Odesk might get the job done with passable code, but the A-level developer who isn't on Odesk (no need because this person has no problem finding work) will deliver a much higher ROI.<p>Sure, the A-level developer won't be a good fit for every situation (maybe you really just need someone really cheap to get the job done ugly) but this person doesn't have much competition.<p>As for the service from the OP goes, just get going.

The entire concept of a signature as an agent of identification is a bit bizzare when you think about it. Your signature is not a secret, but it remains a critical security element.

All the new ARM GPU architectures  coming out this year and next year will support OpenGL ES 3.0 (OpenGL 3.2 features) and OpenCL 1.1.<p>Next year's hardware should also be 4-5x faster in GPU performance than Tegra 3 (that includes Tegra 4, as well as other chips), and around 300 gigaflops each, which I think already surpasses the Xbox 360 and PS3, or it's around as powerful.<p>If Google and many of their partners would put these chips in $99 set top boxes/consoles, and let them play 3D Android games, it could disrupt the console market, simply by flooding the market with the help of multiple manufacturers, a low price, and a decent gaming platform, that could only grow bigger if it takes off, not unlike how Google dominates the smartphone market through the sheer number of Android devices released by many, many manufacturers.<p>I just hope Google is smart enough to recognize this and actually go for it, instead of focusing solely on their ""smart TV"" strategy with their Google TV boxes.",1341939715

And sadly people like PA with their 2 ads get nailed because people have been so massively inundated with ads all day that even one more is painful.<p>Another experiment they haven't tried, but would be good to run, would be to make the site subscriber only with the long tail free. So imagine a site where if you subscribed it was ad free and every few days you got a new comic. There is the 'free' site which is content that is a year old and has advertising on it, and there is a totally free site which has the two years old or later and its got no ads on it.<p>Of course its not as useful for topical content but its an interesting experiment.",1341939604

It's revolutionised how apps get delivered and created a huge barrier to entry for competing phones/devices. Every app (/song) you buy is a reason to not move to a new device.<p>Sure a few developers are more cranky than before but on balance there still seem to be more apps coming out than before.

They'd have an api that allows them to communicate with a regular app. This way, something like Pandora could be split in two, with the background service running constantly, but the gui closing as usual.<p>This make it easier to manage background tasks, and also eliminate the problem of users leaving all their apps running. I guess if the makers of a Service decided to make their api public, other people could develop alternate front ends for it as well.",1264658263

Here's an example regarding the Google announcement: <a href=""http://www.chinasmack.com/stories/google-threatens-leaving-china-chinese-reactions/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.chinasmack.com/stories/google-threatens-leaving-c...</a>.<p>It's difficult for me to gauge the Chinese reaction on my own, though. A handful of translated comments or an online poll don't amount to anything, really. Doubly so once you're aware of the ""50-cent gangsters"" who are paid to astroturf online (see <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/50_Cent_Party"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/50_Cent_Party</a> and <a href=""http://www.zonaeuropa.com/20091221_1.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.zonaeuropa.com/20091221_1.htm</a>). The best resource I have are my adult students who spend the time online and can give me their impressions. So far, their responses have been to the tune of: ""If Google leaves, what am I going to do!? I use GMail and many other services, and the search engine is better than Baidu for finding information in English. It's a critical part of my work!""<p>It should be noted that all of them (university-level and older) are aware of the censorship, they just have differing ideas on its necessity.<p>Do they feel like the West is unfairly criticizing China?
The Party loves playing the victim, probably because Western media affords them ample opportunity. What better way to unify the Chinese and distract them from a growing number of domestic problems than an enormous external enemy? But it's probably not always the direct work of the government - the Chinese are culturally cohesive, where the group is more important than the individual. Nationalism and its ilk pop up so often in the discussions here with students, it's frightening. (I used to live in Japan before coming here, and naturally it comes up when meeting new people. Actually having to try and reassure some people that modern Japan does <i>not</i> want to invade China and enslave them is unreal.)<p>Honestly, it's tough to say if such anti-Western reactions are genuine (thought out and justified) or just an internalized defensive mechanism.",1264654939

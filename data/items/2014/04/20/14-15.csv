7616938,comment,7616817,7616817,2,0,fozzieBoston,,,"That makes sense. A couple of suggestions:\n1. Isolate the backend from the frontend as much as you can. i.e, besides using the rails controllers to actually render your page, exchange all info with JSON and an API like structure. This way, you can change frontend frameworks quickly without having to rewrite any of your backend.<p>2. Make a decision about routes quickly - either use the angularJS routes or Rails, but I would shy away from both. Personally, I found AngularJS routes annoying, specifically when it comes to SEO optimization.<p>3.

It must be trapped with some kind of additive to make it look like a powder. Also, the powder has small holes, so it’s ¿20%? air and a few % of additives and the rest is alcohol. Let’s just assume that it’s 100% alcohol to simplify the discussion.<p>So, 1 glass full of “powdered alcohol” will be equivalent to at most 2 glasses of vodka (3 glasses of weak vodka, 1.5 glasses of strong vodka). It will not be equivalent to 10 glasses of vodka.<p>(With the same calculation, it will be equivalent to 7 glasses of wine or 20 glasses of beer. But people usually drink vodka in smaller glasses and beer in bigger glasses.)<p>Anyway, given the abundance of morons, I also predict that there will be overdoses, but this “powdered alcohol” is roughly as dangerous as vodka.",1398005463

Hardy &quot;A course of pure mathematics&quot; is great too, but it is much more, well, pure, but it stays relatively intuitive and the clarity with which he writes is unparalleled, many things I first really understood from this book.

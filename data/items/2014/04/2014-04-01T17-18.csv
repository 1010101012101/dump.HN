This is the case with millions of people, and there is no reason it shouldn&#x27;t be the case with you.<p>If you decide to go to college, you need a crystal-clear idea of what you want to get out of the experience. 4 years is not a trivial amount of time to waste.<p>Keep in mind that college is always an option. There&#x27;s no reason why everyone should go to college when they are 18 or 19. Time is on your side. If I were you I would keep gaining professional experience until a good reason to go to college presents itself.<p>Just to reiterate: nobody cares about a degree anymore. A monkey could get a degree. It is not an impressive accomplishment, and it is not in itself worth 4 years of your life. Take that into consideration, and if college still appeals to you then it might be worthwhile.",1396375179

7510296,comment,7509317,7509974,3,0,Denzel,,,"I couldn&#x27;t agree with you more. Whenever someone says, &quot;Well you did it without a degree, why can&#x27;t I?&quot; I never discourage them, I simply stress the difficulty of their decision. Instead of credentialing with a degree, do you want to job hop for 3 years, constantly having to prove yourself time and time again just so you can move on to another company with an incrementally better salary? Do you want to be misunderstood for years at a time by strangers, friends, and family? Do you want to constantly have your opinion discounted until proven correct? These are just some of the things you&#x27;ll have to deal with.<p>When I look at my debt-ridden peers graduating from top colleges this summer, I can&#x27;t help but feel happy about my head start: no debt, enough savings to do whatever I please at this point, and an above-average pedigree. But while it may sound like a &quot;success story&quot; to most and I am happy now, I&#x27;ll be damned if there wasn&#x27;t 10 years of darkness and constant feelings of inadequacy that I had to plod through very much alone. It&#x27;s been one heck of a ride, that&#x27;s for sure.",1396375097

No matter the transport, once you start dropping a large enough number of packets it will degrade (or break) the experience.  The use case being discussed is when getting the next packet fast is more important than the overhead of TCP.  You can build retries or various other forms of reliability into your UDP protocol when outdated information is still useful.<p><i>Mixing reliable and unreliable updates for game logic would seem to result in a lot of complexity</i><p>Yes and no.  It&#x27;s complex because game state is complex to begin with, but less daunting than you may think because you can compartmentalize to different components of the game.

If you did have to think through it, or your code reviewer doesn&#x27;t understand it, add a comment explaining it. In any other case, commenting on it is probably useless and adding to clutter. Javadocs are painful to read, not because it&#x27;s a bad idea, but because so often it&#x27;s things like &quot;toString(): returns a string that is the string of this object&quot;.\nSorry, I only need to know that function exists and it&#x27;s return. I want to be able to scan through and see only those functions that are conceptually strange or unique, not the boilerplate that every class has to have, and is identical. If there&#x27;s a comment on the toString() function, it had better be documenting something interesting, or else it&#x27;s more useless than nothing.",1396372503

The .gitattributes patterns are not always obvious. Also .gitattibutes doesn&#x27;t support encrypting the whole repo because it&#x27;s lacking the negating parameter that allow you to encrypt everything except the .gitattribute file.<p>The second issue is that a lot of times I ended up having my repo in an inconsistent state. Some times, especially during rebases, something would go wrong and encrypted files would get marked as dirty even if they haven&#x27;t changed. Running `git checkout` on these files would not work to put them back in a consistent state. I would have to remove the git-crypt config in .git/config and reset the repo to fix the issue. Some times the file didn&#x27;t decrypt properly, although thing might have been an issue between the combination of git and git-crypt versions.<p>So in short, git-crypt is an awesome idea but I think is at the wrong level of abstraction. It relies on feature that haven&#x27;t really been designed for security.<p>EDIT: To be a bit more constructive: the first issue could be mitigated by adding a `git-crypt check <path>` that tells you if a file is encrypted or not behind the scene.",1396372351

As a gamer, I feel some sympathy for this.<p>However, this is a case where the game devs are lacking in vision.<p>(1) My very first impression of the news last week was: Wow, I did not know that Zuckerberg had the guts and vision.  I did not respect Zuckerberg at all. After the news, I see it as not only a big move for Facebook, I also explicitly acknowledge Zuckerberg as a visionary. Where this can go will disrupt what we think of as social networking, and being able to throw away the work which you have a vested interest in in order to bring in something greater, that takes courage.<p>(2) Discussing this with friends and then looking at what is emerging, it is pretty clear to me that this is not a vanity buy, and that the scope of Oculus has now been expanded to something much <i>much</i> greater than gaming. We&#x27;re no longer talking about the next evolutionary stage of gaming; we&#x27;re talking about the next fundamental shift in how the <i>mainstream</i> will interact on the internet. Gamers have this unconscious, perhaps implicit, understanding of what it means to interact with the virtual world; many folks in the mainstream do not. When this pans out in the mainstream (months? years?), it will create a shift in the psychology of individuals, something we have only seen discussed in sci-fi and cyberpunk stories. Or at least, that is the potential. Execution remains to be seen :-)<p>(3) Game devs in general have great imagination. Like artists, filmmakers, game devs bring their vision out into the world for others to experience. They tend to have a better feel for the future, for what the world can be, than your average person. However, I find it ironic that the game devs are so fixated on Oculus Rift = Gaming Device, that this is one of the rare times game devs failed to see the greater vision.<p>(4) Based on what Caramack, Palmer, and Abrash were talking about in the articles that have emerged ... until Zuckerberg showed up, they too also framed the Oculus tech as a <i>gaming</i> technology. That was what they sold it as in the Kickstarter, and many people were on board with it. So I understand how many gamers and game devs are up in arms about this. It&#x27;s also kind of sad to me: these same folks who are so imaginative are failing to see the much grander vision.",1396372009

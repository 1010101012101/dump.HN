4058476,comment,4058087,4058381,8,0,lazerwalker,,,"> Also stop blogging and fix it if it's a problem - that's the joy of open source. If they don't want the 'fix', then its not a fix for the supposed problem or the problem didn't exist to start with.<p>A flaw of many open source software projects is that they tend to be inhospitable to designers coming in and attempting to contribute in a meaningful manner. Usability shouldn't just mean ""dumbing things down"", no, but if a program is well-designed then improving its accessibility to newcomers need not be at odds with elegant and efficient operation for more advanced users.<p>There are many projects where attempting to submit a patch that improved usability would be met on deaf ears, even if it was a change that solved a legitimate design problem or improved on a current solution, because the maintainers of the project have a mindset of ""the design works for me, therefore it works for everyone"". In this case, ""fixing the problem"" doesn't mean actively contributing to an open source project (since that in itself is the problem), it means attempting to change the approach people take to managing open source projects.<p>This article in particular is a messy jumble of ineffectual buzzwords, but there is a small nugget of truth buried in there.",1338656105

What's the usability of bash? GCC? Emacs? And perhaps more importantly, for whom is the usability measured? The linux-ecosystem is mostly used by programmers. It's natural that the user interfaces tend to reflect this. One of the main reasons i have linux on my computers is exactly this, I really don't want the user interfaces of Windows or OS X.<p>Problems and solutions are described, but exactly _how_ to implement these solutions isn't stated very clearly, and I'd hesitate to call these suggestions ""solutions"" because, to be brutally honest, it's all empty talk.<p>Furthermore I feel like many of these solutions come at odds with the foss-culture in general. If I'm giving away my time and code for free, I really don't want a project manager or a designer to tell me what to do. I'm going to do what feels interesting, or I'm going to implement features that I need. If someone else can use my code too, then that's great. If not then that's ok too. To me it's strictly hobby basis. I don't get wages, and I don't have ""customers"". I'll contribute because it's fun or because I want to honor the idea that I should contribute back changes and improvements I've made to software that I got for free.<p>Of course, this could be very different if I were employed and paid to make software that coincidentally also was free, but I'm not. Maybe this blog post was aimed at Canonical and their employees, or the practices of big projects like GNOME. If so, then maybe he could have the decency to say so, instead of going about ""solving"" other peoples problems that aren't really there.",1338655672

No one is a slave or can sign a meaningful contract to that effect, in my personal opinion.  Judges may differ.)",1338655194

The existing evidence includes the typical experience of people new to FOSS using things like Emacs, VIM, Gnome or GIMP, a difficult-to-explain preference for proprietary software among professionals in various fields and among typical consumers, each person's individual experience,  various critical analyses of free software by usability experts studying the problem, and sundry other evidence. If this isn't enough to convince you that free software broadly has comparatively poor usability, the odds of discovering additional evidence that would convince you is probably too slim to be worth the effort. But it's a premise many of us accept. For those among us who do, blog posts like this provide some insight.",1338652820

Maybe one person that understands English enough to actually answer a question in front of a camera. It's insulting.<p>90% of the population doesn't have a single clue about how the government runs, anything about the economy, foreign relations, what any of the candidates are even speaking about. It's a population voting blindly based on which TV shows and commercials they happen to watch. We have states that practically automatically turn towards a certain party each time. An electoral college system makes all of the difference. Overfunded campaigns that buy your vote like big companies sell you their garbage. It's a mess..",1225763979

I think.)<p>We all know that voting is statistically meaningless--in fact, even if the vote comes down 50.0 million to 50.0 million, the actual result will be decided by whoever has the better lawyer in the inevitable supreme court spectacle.<p>So really, the only value is in the psychological effect voting has on yourself. Libertarians sometimes say ""Don't vote"" for this very reason, because voting makes you a participant in a corrupt system. (It's a standard brainwashing tactic to get people to <i>say</i> things they don't believe. Even if they know they don't believe, the honorable sense of ""keeping one's word"" overwhelms reason.)<p>Therefore, 3rd party votes are completely legitimate, since elections are pyschologically valid and mathematically pointless.",1225763608

352823,comment,352491,352491,0,0,osipov,,,"I'm in grad school and watch all my lectures using the approach described in the blog post. After following this accelerated viewing approach for almost 2 years I can tell you that in reality the content doesn't get consumed ""much more quickly"".<p>First, for most lecturers it isn't possible to listen to recordings more than 1.5 times faster. At this rate, there is a roughly 33% reduction in the time it takes to view a lecture. It is noticeably faster, but not really significant unless you are viewing more than 1 lecture at a time, for example a lecture is typically 50 minutes, so one saves about 17 minutes per lecture. In my experience the savings fail to realize for the reasons I'll cover further.<p>Second, the rate at which the lecture can be accelerated varies significantly depending on the professor who is presenting the material. Some professors speak quickly and once the playback speed is increased to 1.5, their speech becomes blurred and unintelligible. Often the native English speakers are the ones who can't be sped up much. Luckily, at my school most of the professors aren't native speakers so a rate of 1.5 is adequate. For non-native speakers, the useful playback rate varies pretty widely. One of my professors who is from Turkey speaks slowly and his lectures can be played and understood at a speed up of 2.<p>Third, the playback speed does affect comprehension. Even at a normal playback rate I find that some topics covered in the lecture require a rewind and a replay. Accelerated playback requires closer attention and more frequent replays. Of course how often one needs to replay the lecture depends on the content and varies from person to person.",1225763531

This actually breaks far less than you would expect. For most practical purposes, you only need the countable axiom of choice, which is the intuitively reasonable version.<p>The main thing the loss of the uncountable version breaks is the Hahn-Banach theorem on spaces of dimension higher than countable infinity.

The first particle has a position x (1 real number), the second particle has a position y (1 real number). ""Physical space"" would be the set of real numbers (R^1), while configuration space is the set of <i>pairs</i> of real numbers (x,y) (this set is R^2). The first number in the pair represents the position of particle 1, the second the position of particle 2.<p>An entangled state is simply a probability distribution on R^2 which is not a product state (i.e. P(x,y) != P_1(x) P_2(y)).

So when travelling, you recommend selecting restaurants by looking inside each establishment and inspecting the <i>clothing</i> of the customers? By that argument, how could any restaurant beat (eg) McDonald's, with its casually-dressed,  repeat customers?",1331182791

The email actually arrived after some of our automated jobs had stopped running. There should have been an advanced warning that such an audit would take place. I'm glad we had monitoring on our automations, but many people won't have those and might still be unaware that they are not running until they authorize their keys.",1331182769
3678635,comment,3676179,3677165,1,0,joshmlewis,,,"I'm a designer and recently started a side project with a friend.  We decided to use bootstrap because it was super easy to get started with off the ground..no reset stylesheets, defining default fonts, sizes, etc, and no implementing a grid framework.  It was all right there.  And for the most part everything was generally a good starting point.  I changed the header color, used a different font for the logo (a google web font), and then built off the base that bootstrap gave me.<p>I say it's useful for two things:  quick and dirty way of getting a prototype barely functioning and looking decent.  The second is getting me right into the design cockpit without worrying about all the defaults and resets and foundation of it all.  I change a few heights/widths/colors/fonts and we have something decently unique.<p>Edit:  I might add that if a.) my app took off or b.) I was presenting it to someone important, I would make sure it was very unique and all my design and UX principles were put into play.  But for simply prototyping an idea, or having a good base for a project, it's a great tool.",1331182763

They may be reviews created by multiple accounts from the same computer to inflate a restaurant's rating.  Or they may all be negative reviews created by one person with multiple accounts to try to hurt a business they weren't happy with.  Either way, I think it's perfectly reasonable that such a system of filtering should and does exist.<p>Now maybe their filtering system is so horrendous that it makes a 4-star restaurant seem like a 2.5 star restaurant, but I find this hard to believe.<p>As for asking people to advertise with them to make ""bad reviews disappear"", that would be terrible, so I can't speak to that, since all we have to go on is this particular owner's word vs Yelp's.

Don't waste it!""<p>I am thinking of going that route. That is, I would ""sell""/charge a fee for access to my software under the BSD/MIT license; those who want it for no cost will be under a non-free license. However, I know of precious few companies which have done that. Most free software providers also make the source code available at no cost.<p>Can people point to examples of companies - preferably small companies which write their own software - which provide free software for a fee? (Other than RedHat.) What are the pros and cons? Is there much negative reaction to the idea?<p>My clients are pharmaceutical and biotech companies, who have no interest in redistributing any software they acquire, so I'm not really concerned about others immediately picking it up and reselling it, or incorporating it into other (non-free) products, or giving it away for free; to say nothing of providing support.<p>There aren't that many people in computational chemistry, and so it's rare to get code contributions from anyone else, so I'm not concerned about excluding possible involvement from others. While on the other hand, companies have money to pay for very expensive software.<p>Overall it seems like distributing free software for a fee is a great way to get money to fund a project - why don't more people do it?",1331180096

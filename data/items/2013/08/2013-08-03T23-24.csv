We perfectly understand that the Finn is not for every occasion, in fact the Finn is an ideal partner for our App BikeCityGuide, a navigation specialized for bikes, so when you need guidance (or you want to track yourself), the both work great together, so when you do take your phone, consider us :)<p>Anyway, thanks for the feedback!",1375574384

Otherwise you will either not have an story of object reclamation, or you&#x27;ll have memory leaks. It&#x27;s just sufficient if one program, in one language, can reference a window containing code written in a different language. Doing this right is hard. See either Wegiel and Krintz OOPSLA&#x27;10 or Pizlo, Hosking, and Vitek LCTES&#x27;07 for studies of prior attempts to have interoperability between independent GCs. Both seem to indicate >5% throughput regression. Are you claiming that a 5% throughput regression is worth it to support a new language, that is not an open standard, and currently has nonexistent adoption?&quot;<p>There were no replies from Chromium&#x27;s side.<p>My information regarding Oilpan was based on Justin Fagnani&#x27;s message in this thread: <a href=""https://groups.google.com/a/dartlang.org/forum/#!msg/misc/ymUrZT_e5Yc/fw1n35o4FTAJ"" rel=""nofollow"">https://groups.google.com/a/dartlang.org/forum/#!msg/misc/ym...</a><p>&quot;We&#x27;re hoping to not have to re-introduce scopes, since in dart2js we don&#x27;t have a memory leak, and <i>Dartium will be able to collect cycles across heaps when Oilpan lands. This would mean that there are leaks in Dartium until Oilpan,</i> but that&#x27;s similar to the leaks that GWT-Exporter has, which I&#x27;ve seen go into production with no problems, so I&#x27;m hoping it&#x27;s manageable.&quot;<p>Here&#x27;s how I interpret the situation: Cross-VM memory leaks are a blocker for shipping in any browser; you cannot reasonably say the implementation is done if it is leaky (on this I assume we agree). Dartium currently has cross-VM memory leaks (&quot;cycles across heaps&quot; as above). Upstream WebKit raised issues regarding the performance cost of collecting cross-VM cycles, which Dartium currently does not do. Chromium&#x27;s plan to mitigate this seems to be Oilpan. This is fineit&#x27;s the most logical response!but doing the same in other browsers is going to be a huge burden, since all browsers use reference-counted DOM handles.<p>If things have changed since then, please let me know and I will happily correct my post.",1375574149

I&#x27;ve seen a couple of other highway features which, if taken too fast by an unfamiliar driver, could easily lead to calamity.

My intention when I post here is always to share my personal point of view, which now happens to include a lot more information from inside this company that I work for.<p>I&#x27;m not here to &quot;convince&quot; people to use Dart. That will only happen because of it&#x27;s utility to developers, and I&#x27;m more than fine with slower organic growth if it develops more from actual problems being solved, and less from hype. If anything there&#x27;s a ton of anti-hype around Dart, so it has a lot to overcome with some people even if does address their problems. Such is life.<p>I&#x27;m pretty sure there will be such an explicit commitment to Dart communicated externally, but since I&#x27;m speaking for me, and since the question at hand had to do with what would happen _if_ Dart were canceled I addressed the hypothetical situation. Maybe a PR departments would have danced around that and simply said, &quot;we&#x27;re committed to Dart. Next question&quot;, but I&#x27;d much rather dig in say that we&#x27;re committed, but sure, &quot;what if&quot;. To me that&#x27;s a real discussion, not a rhetoric, not a pitch.<p>As for my tone, can you imagine what it&#x27;s like to have the company you work for called &quot;evil&quot; because they shut down a RSS reader or move away from using XMPP in their chat app? Or that you can&#x27;t rely on Google because of the Reader shutdown, or the price increase on App Engine when it came out of preview. I hardly agree with every things Google does, but the hyperbole surrounding it is incredible. Not every product that any company makes will be successful, not every product can be kept alive indefinitely. Google receives an inordinate amount of flak for it&#x27;s changes, mainly I think because we have so many products that it&#x27;s easy to keep seeing a small fraction of them change it&#x27;s still seems like a lot because it&#x27;s all under Google. Meanwhile there&#x27;s multiple instances a day of some other companies products changing, or shutting down, or being bought to be shuttered later, but because they&#x27;re spread out over many brands. The recent constant chime of &quot;evil&quot; and &quot;unreliable&quot; is so often drawn on really warped and rushed comparisons that don&#x27;t make sense if just a little thought is put into analysis, so yes, it gets really old, to me, personally.<p>Not only that, it could cause a &quot;the sky is falling&quot; perception of communities like HN. This is a real concern of mine because many times there are legitimate points here and several of us like to represent them back into the company. If HN reflexively interprets everything that Google does as evil and bad, it becomes harder for the Google members of the community to go internally and say &quot;this isn&#x27;t being received well, is there room for improvement?&quot;. We haven&#x27;t reached that point yet, but it&#x27;s something I worry about. The reaction to the &quot;no servers on Fiber&quot; rule is the type of thing that several of us try to represent back to the company. I, and many Googlers, respect the hell out of this community, but the more ridiculous the FUD and conspiracy theories get, the more the reputation erodes. I don&#x27;t want to see that happen, so I actively combat it when I can, by trying to dispel the falsehoods, and also by chiming in when I agree with some of the negative sentiments.

You don&#x27;t have that sort of variability based on actual value produced in many traditional jobs, which I think is a shame.<p>Are some teachers in the US actually <i>overpaid</i> relative to the long-term value they produce in their role?  Surely, even if their base pay is bad I&#x27;m sure some of them don&#x27;t even actually earn what they make.  But are some teachers incredibly underpaid? Surely, as well.  However, for the vast majority of &quot;traditional&quot; jobs we&#x27;ve created these compensation structures where you can nudge people up or down relative to their peers, but not by nearly enough to adjust for their true value.",1375571519

   providers have this issue, and it&#x27;s been a known downside for years: when 
   product support ends for an installed app, you still have the old installed 
   app to use, when support is ended for SaaS users have a problem. I hope this 
   can be mitigated one day, but that&#x27;s a whole other topic. The differences 
   with Google is that we have a ton of users even for our small products, and 
   there&#x27;s a single name to attach attention to, rather than the numerous 
   shutdowns that have happened in other companies, or the startups that have 
   bee bought and killed.

No, the difference with google is they use their billions of dollars and monopoly/near monopoly status in neighboring markets to come in, underprice competitors for years to not only win users for a saas product but also to poison the market and drive all competitors out of business, and then close up shop and wonder why people are pissed.<p><pre><code>   As for traction, if Dart doesn&#x27;t get any traction (after it&#x27;s actually 
   released, and had a good chance to succeed of course), inside Google or

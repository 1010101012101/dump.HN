Pet peeve of mine, people saying ""who"" when they mean ""whom"" - if the ""who"" is the object of the action ""work for"" then it is ""whom"", like ""To whom are you speaking?"" NOT ""Who are you speaking to?"" Irks me no end.",1224860334

I'm not attending any crazy seminars or spend all of my time on self-help books, but he shifted my thinking to that I can change and control myself and my life general.

Forgive my skepticism.<p>There are a lot of snake-oil salesmen out there that are going to sucker you in with their smooth words. Hey, if he writes about things and it helps you, that's great. Still doesn't convince me he graduated with 2 degrees in 3 semesters. It does convince me he knows how to make some money, though.<p>Even if you had nothing better to do in your life at that time, taking on 30-40 units is beyond a full time job. You'd litterally be looking at something like 60-80 hours of work a week. That's unreasonable by any standard. It's just like some other articles posted on here saying, working super long hours and little sleep isn't something that is productive or something worth bragging about.<p>Also, after reading through some of his articles he doesn't sound like a very logical person. I won't argue with results, but some things said on their don't exactly vibe with reason imo.",1224859321

The market does not move exactly in lockstep.  When Goldman Sachs was at 85, it was an effing steal.  I would still invest in it today if I had the money, but I wouldn't totally pounce on it.<p>As for timing the bottom, yea that's kinda hard.  I would watch more experienced players call it <i>cough</i> Buffett <i>cough</i>, instead of listening to random people (yes I know, random ppl like me) on the internetz. ;)",1224859282

342372,comment,341688,342349,0,0,Alex3917,,,"Personally I like Salon. They don't publish very often, but unlike newspapers I don't find blatant errors in all the subjects I know anything about. Their investigative journalism is pretty good too; they've covered everything from NetHack to what really happened at Columbine HS. IIRC they even broke the bridge to nowhere story and were the first to publish the Abu Ghraib photos. It doesn't really have any agenda. The columnists tend to be socially liberal, but it's clear the beliefs they're expressing are their own and not just what they're told to write about. Think of it like Jon Stewart in newspaper form.<p>Anyway I don't think they are really ready to be a suitable replacement to the NYT quite yet, but if the NYT goes bust and Salon were to scoop up some of the talent and merge with a couple other independent outlets they might be able to put together something good.",1224857737

Reduces the chances of a single-point failure taking everything out.  It is going to be somewhere in cost and resiliency between relying on DNS and ""doing it right"".<p>In all reality (and my own experiences) data-center outages to various ""natural/random disasters"" are far less common than outages due to just basic employee stupidity.

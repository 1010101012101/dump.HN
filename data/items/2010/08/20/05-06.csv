Convincing those users to move to decentralized social networking, whether its with GNU social, Appleseed, Diaspora, etc is going to be a tough job no matter what, and we should do everything we can to make that easy for people.<p>One of the biggest problems with Facebook is that its ever changing UI causes people to leak their private information all over the place.

There's a ton of room for improvement and innovation in soft keyboards too. I'm not sure replicating a physical keyboard on-screen is even the optimal approach. In 5 years we might have soft keyboards that barely resemble a QWERTY keyboard. Especially on tablet devices with more screen space to play with. I think the next incremental step is probably grammar / style correction based on analyzing your writing style. For power users who need to do heavy duty text input on mobiles you could have a short hand style input system that allows you to input text at brain speed to be revised before sending into a proper language. You might switch between all these different software input types for different tasks. I don't think physical keyboards will disappear anytime soon but they may increasingly become a security blanket in the form of a Bluetooth keyboard you keep in your back pack just in case.",1282282671

1619605,comment,1619534,1619534,0,0,Ixiaus,,,"I agree with what nostromo said and wish to add to that based off of my own life experience (and personality).<p>My personality tends toward the reserved side of things (I'm an INTJ if that helps at all) and especially so when I'm focused on something; a lot of people have a hard time with me when they first meet me, generally because I'm very intense. I also have another side of me, a really goofy and playful side - I've noticed most people that don't retreat deep into their own psyche's on a regular basis only mesh well with other butterflies - people love quirky and goofy personality, frisky is a good word too. Cultivate your quirky, playful side and people will have an easier time of caring less about your retracted side.<p>Don't go changing yourself because people don't ""get you"". Though, there is something to be said for being approachable and fun enough that the kids want to play with you in the sandbox; all you have to do is bring out that playful, fun personality - even if your eccentricities make that ""playful"" side really odd or strange, people will still respond positively to it.<p>I had a rough journey going from being a complete recluse and introverted thinker to being the thing I am (a heavy thinker) to also allowing a fun and ""I'm no longer afraid of what people think of me"" state of mind. I prefer to hang at home and read, work on projects, or hack but I'm right at home when going out with a large group of friends whom aren't anywhere near being geeks or nerds. I'm also comfortable in my skin to interact with strangers, more so actually, than my super-extroverted girlfriend.<p>International travel/backpacking will also change that aspect of your personality a great deal, going through India alone forced me to make friends and exposed my psyche to so many things I couldn't even begin to outline what it did for me in a simple comment...<p>Grooming takes time, figure out what social niche you tend to roll with (hipster? geek? alt? fetish? burner? normal? the list goes on) and start looking people who epitomize those sub-cultures and look at how they dress, match things together, &c... It will come with time, effort, and actually <i>going to the mall</i>.<p>Hygiene (the other half of grooming) is more important than clothing, honestly. Shower <i>every day</i> and wash your armpits, groin, asscrack, and neck with soap and water (those areas in particular because many of your glands that produce body scents and odors are located in those areas). Use soap or body wash that smells good, if you want to feel like you're a refined urban dweller, get some home-made natural products (body salts with eucalyptus essential oils, &c...). Usually after soaping down, I use a sugar or salt scrub with essential oils in it - it makes your skin very smooth and you smell <i>way</i> better than when you use that Axe body wash crap (not to mention the nasty chemicals they put in it).<p>Keep your hair trimmed, and not just the stuff on your head!!!! This is so important for men. I'm a <i>huge</i> advocate of facial hair, but we start looking like bears when we let it get out of control, so keep it <i>under control</i>. I have a shaped beard, some men have full but trimmed beards. Some men shave it all, do what works for you but keep it sharp. This also goes for underarm hair, I shave mine, some dudes just trim it so they don't have ""tufts"" oozing out of their arms. I personally keep my arm and leg hair but shave my chest and stomach.<p>Wear deoderant! Put it on every day right after your shower. Use scented soaps, particularly, around your groin - mine emits a rather potent fragrance and go from ""fragrant"" to ""icky crotch smell"" in a matter of a few hot hours; whether you have potential lady action or not, humans have an uncanny ability to pick up on ""invisible"" or ""barely noticeable"" scents. When my girlfriend is on her period, more men hit on her (it's noticeable) even though you can't ""smell"" anything at the conscious level.<p>Exercise! Get your body in shape, and even build some muscle - it doesn't make you any less intellectual to have a build, it makes you healthier and more capable of using your brain. Not to mention people are naturally better disposed towards a person that takes care of their body.<p>There are many books out there on fashion, manners, and hygiene too. A book I liked was ""Freakin' Fabulous"" by Clinton Kelly - I highly recommend it. Also, take pointers from gay men, they <i>really</i> know how to groom themselves well.",1282282270

It will help you to respond to them in a sensible way.  Pretend you are them.<p>This isn't to say you should be patronizing, walking around with a smile and piling undeserved politeness on everyone you meet (especially if they're rude to you); in fact, I hate walking into a store and being treated this way by employees, because I never find it sincere.

Then, a D primitive called emplace allows you to construct objects at specified memory locations (a la C++'s placement new operator)"".<p>The emplace function is in the std.conv library and is the basis for constructing objects outside of the control of the garbage collector.<p>My understanding is that most library functions do not care about whether you are using garbage collection or not. Library functions are usually written in a parameterized way such that you can use any appropriate object; so long as it has the right methods.<p>Take a look for example at the std.algorithm library:\n<a href=""http://www.digitalmars.com/d/2.0/phobos/std_algorithm.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.digitalmars.com/d/2.0/phobos/std_algorithm.html</a>\nI don't think anything there cares whether you use garbage collection for your types or not.",1282281537

I did almost exactly the same.<p>Personally I use Netbeans it is a great all around IDE, for a good portion of languages not only is it a great development environment but, in some cases it actually is best of class. I use the same IDE for Java, Javascript (supports jQuery and Dojo out of the box), it has good clojure support, scala, C, PHP, Python, Ruby well the list goes on. I suggest trying it for 2 weeks and I can gurantee you will be sold. I do web, and Android development in Netbeans.<p>For OSX /iPhone/ iPad I use xCode for obvious reasons. Join the developer program and get the beta of 4 it is infinitely better.<p>For wire-framing I use OmniGraffle Pro, it is best of class out of all offerings both mac and PC.<p>for screen-shots I use command + shift + 3 for full screen and command + shift + 4 to do a box lasso of a portion of the screen, I don't use a tool.<p>To-Do-List I just use iCal wired up to Google calendar.<p>Web browser I use Firefox and firebug as my main browser and Javascript debugger. I also have Safari, Chrome and Opera<p>virtulization I use Virtual Box, it is free and as good as the rest of them. I used to use VMware fusion, but virtual box was just as good.<p>Skype yep probably the best developer collaboration tool out there. I work with 6 other freelancer as a co-op and we would not be as efficient as we are without skype. We are distributed across the globe.<p>I use Photoshop for graphics.<p>I think you have the big ones covered and the small ones are preference really. Other than the IDE I would not change a thing, You should really give Netbeans a try it is not just a Java IDE and specifically for Java it is far Superior to Eclipse.<p>Here are some other tools you may want to look at as well:<p><a href=""http://www.panic.com/transmit/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.panic.com/transmit/</a>\n<a href=""http://www.ragesw.com/index.php"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ragesw.com/index.php</a>\n<a href=""http://www.advancedwebranking.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.advancedwebranking.com/</a>",1282280961

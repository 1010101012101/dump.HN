It encourages goal setting and taking action, in this case writing code, and doing whatever is necessary to get stuff done. When you finally start dabbling on the academic side, you have ""hooks"" in your mind to hang bits of knowledge that some might gloss over. These are earned from past experiences.<p>Another benefit is that even when your earlier projects don't turn out the way you want, you have a visible path of progression that you can show your potential employers, potential co-founders, or even yourself just to reflect on.\nIn a way, my past projects are my programmers diary.",1293609555

He’d rather throw himself on his sword and kill himself than have the game be bad.</i><p><i>Broussard simply couldn’t tolerate the idea of Duke Nukem Forever coming out with anything other than the latest and greatest technology and awe-inspiring gameplay. He didn’t just want it to be good. It had to surpass every other game that had ever existed, the same way the original Duke Nukem 3D had.<p>But because the technology kept getting better, Broussard was on a treadmill. He’d see a new game with a flashy graphics technique and demand the effect be incorporated into Duke Nukem Forever. “One day George started pushing for snow levels,” recalls a developer who worked on Duke Nukem Forever for several years starting in 2000. Why? “He had seen The Thing” — a new game based on the horror movie of the same name, set in the snowbound Antarctic — “and he wanted it.” The staff developed a running joke: If a new title comes out, don’t let George see it. When the influential shoot-’em-up Half-Life debuted in 1998, it opened with a famously interactive narrative sequence in which the player begins his workday in a laboratory, overhearing a coworker’s conversation that slowly sets a mood of dread. The day after Broussard played it, an employee told me, the cofounder walked into the office saying, “Oh my God, we have to have that in Duke Nukem Forever.”</i>",1293607937

V8 seems to beat TraceMonkey on both CPU and memory benchmarks ( <a href=""http://shootout.alioth.debian.org/u64/benchmark.php?test=all&lang=v8&lang2=tracemonkey"" rel=""nofollow"">http://shootout.alioth.debian.org/u64/benchmark.php?test=all...</a> ), so I doubt their approach has ""lost"". They probably do this because most JavaScript programs are very small and it's relatively cheap to compile everything to assembler from the start. They do their optimizations on assembler level as well - instead of doing it at bytecode level as it's done in most other VMs. This is at least the information I gathered when I looked at V8 last time - it was a year ago, so things might have changed.",1268222281

1180681,comment,1180517,1180517,0,0,illumen,,,"Ahead of time compilers do work quite well for a subset of dynamic languages.  Just like tracing JIT works well for a subset.  This has been proven by projects like shedskin, cython, and tinypyC++.  Given typing information, either explicitly or through type inference - massive speed-ups are possible.<p>Also, tracing JIT currently does not do multiple CPU optimizations - which static compilers have been doing.  They also don't do SIMD or MIMD optimizations, which compilers like gcc/icc/etc are doing.<p>However, runtime assemblers - like 'Orc' 'corepy' and older ones like 'softwire' are proving to be lots faster in multimedia applications compared to traditional compilers or interpreters.  These runtime assemblers give authors of programs access to the compilers/assemblers.  Just like allowing people to specify typing, letting people construct programs at runtime can give massive speed-ups.<p>C has even had fast interpreters for a while - see tinycc as an example.  It doesn't use a tracing compiler, but a very straight forward direct translation compiler which happens to be faster than many interpreters.<p>It's quite easy to argue 'No' to this question I think.",1268221860

1180666,comment,1180625,1180625,0,0,patio11,,,"I'm kind of a metrics junkie.<p>One thing I've learned over the years: tracking data is easy.  You can generate a virtual firehose of noise just by snapping your fingers.  Tracking data which actually drives decisions meaningful for the business is a bit trickier.<p>I use a mix of Mixpanel, the DB, and key/value stores.  I have log files, too, but log files are where data goes to die.<p>In general my core activity loop is generating a hypothesis, asking what I need to answer the hypothesis, either building just what I need to capture that data or a more generalized system (particularly when I keep asking the same kind of questions -- this is how I ended up writing my own A/B testing framework), then analyzing the data and trying a few things in response to it.  The hardest part about drowning in data is understanding, in your bones, that if it doesn't drive a decision at the end of the day, you're just wasting your time.  Even though the graph is pretty.<p>I generally get more bang for my buck out of simple hypotheses than complex ones.  Simple ones are easy to describe, easy to instrument, easy to test, easy to improve, and likely to apply to a large portion of my users/business/etc.  Complex ones are, well, the exact opposite.  For example, while it is within my capabilities to target behavior at Mac-owning Firefox users who are interested in Catholicism...  I'm probably going to spend time working on buttons seen by substantially everyone.<p>I generally do the first cut of analysis by playing around in my Rails console.  When I find something interesting in playing around, I often promote it to a graph somewhere on the backend.<p>I think if you count all the data points I've got filed away somewhere you'd come up with a number in the low tens of millions, so my chief bottleneck is less technical/scaling (3 million entries in a key/value store?  Oh well, iterate over all of them.) and more that the time, creativity, and attention to ask the right questions are very limited.",1268220951

Then I can run Python scripts on my own computer to just go through the text. I get about 60MB of events / day. Soon I will have to start deleting old events from App Engine, because I have to pay Google for data store entities stored.<p>At first I was planning on doing some clever incremental thing to get all the stats on App Engine, but it's a lot simpler if you can just have everything locally and rerun any analytics quickly when I make mistakes. It only takes a few minutes to load a week's worth of data and go through it, so doesn't make sense to spend days trying to be really clever about doing it on App Engine.<p>My favorite thing to extract is kind of a life story of users. When a user joins, what do they do on average in the first 24 hours? How about the next day? This is a pretty different point of view than Google Analytics, because it is from the user point of view and not historical of the whole app.<p>So does this point of view give you some new insight? At least in our case. For example we are now testing which of two profile box designs is better on our MySpace app. Just a simple stat would reveal that the new design has a better clickthrough rate. BUT, when I look at the whole story, it seems that users are more likely to remove the app when they have this new design, so end results may be worse.<p>Additionally I use Google Analytics events tracking, but I end up looking more at the life story than those events, because it is difficult to pull out how many events happen per visit, or how many events happen per visit in first 24 hours since user joined etc.",1268219734

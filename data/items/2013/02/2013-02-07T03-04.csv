It is probably a Jedi mind trick to make ourselves feel more important/smarter/what have you. Luckily the free market for labor mostly exists (ignoring possibly shady deals between certain large tech companies) and people feeling undervalued can test that theory by shopping their skillset around. I think more people feel undervalued/underappreciated than pursue the ""shopping around"" angle. There are lots of reasons/excuses as to why, but protecting one's ego probably has a role, acknowledged or not.",1360209551

They're really well-designed and the noise level is not too bad even in the room with the rack, but there is also a 1U SuperMicro server in that rack with two Tesla cards and it is so loud as to be quite annoying anywhere in the house.  I keep it turned off unless I'm specifically working on it, which isn't how I'd like it to be.  The lesson I learned is that bigger servers (4U would be even better) have bigger fans and run more quietly.  Also IBM servers aren't as loud as Dell and Dell servers are quieter than SuperMicro.

We have not been contacted by the client since the dispute was settled some 3 weeks ago, so all of this comes as a complete surprise.<p>We worked with this client for over 2 months. As is the standard practice, development initially took place on one of our test servers. Once the plugin was complete the client tested and approved the work, then gave us permission to integrate on his site. Integration was met with a number of conflicts due to previous customizations on the client's site. These are outlined in the PM history for the project. We then moved back to our test server to attempt integration (using the client's site backbone). After tireless work weeding through the conflicts we were able to achieve a workable solution. The client then tested and approved the work done, even saying ""it's very close"". A few days later the dispute was filed and we have not heard from the client since its resolution.<p>The hacking is an absurd and unfair allegation. The client has posted the same work/project on multiple sites since the dispute resolution, and very well could have done so prior to hiring us. It's very possible that any number of ""coders/developers"" out there have access to the client's site. A company can't achieve 406 perfect reviews over the course of many years of work without being supremely professional and conscientious.<p>We hope this gives you a clearer understanding of the background to the situation.<p>Cheers,

5180380,comment,5176288,5178237,5,0,Silhouette,,,"<i>I don't think that ""closed source / commercial alternatives"" (IE in the browser case) have done any better on the bug side than the open source ones.</i><p>So the received wisdom would have us believe. The thing is, my bug trackers objectively say different.<p>In the past 12 months, I have seen exactly one serious bug in IE (where I define ""serious"" to mean that user-visible functionality in at least one web app I've worked on does not work properly, even though the same functionality worked in earlier versions of the same browser and/or works in multiple other browsers). That one may have been IE's fault or it may have been a problem with a Java update, since the bad behaviour was at the interface between JS and Java and both had recently had updates when we started to see the problem.<p>In contrast, I have seen serious bugs in Chrome in <i>every</i> web app I work on, ranging from another Java integration issue through to messing up HTML5 video. Several of those bugs still haven't been fixed several update cycles later. Statistically, across all the projects I'm working on -- which since I'm doing various freelance work and running multiple businesses have little in common except for all being web apps -- it is clear that Chrome is <i>by far</i> the flakiest browser at the moment.<p>Firefox is actually faring slightly better lately, though as a Firefox user rather than a developer they still keep making usability screw-ups. I get that there have been a couple of critical security issues with Java recently, but since Firefox itself patches at least a handful of critical issues <i>every release cycle</i> I think the ""Don't use this, run away, it's scary!"" treatment is frankly rather childish. And as of version 18, Firefox frequently seems to corrupt the display of text areas like the one I'm typing this in.<p>I don't like to be negative about software since nothing's really perfect in this business, but I do point the finger squarely at the advocates of six-weekly releases on this one. The quality of Chrome has never been that great and it's always suffered from ""UI rearranging itself at random"" syndrome because of the silent updates. However, the quality of Firefox has nose-dived since the move to a rapid release cycle; I'd estimate we're seeing 4-5x as many minor issues in Firefox across all the projects I work on since that happened, plus a couple of howlers like the plug-in screw-up in the first so-called long term support release.",1360208276

My father worked for a company for 30 years and was  fired for age discrimination (his reviews were always good, well liked at the company). He basically wrote everything there was for training new employees at the company as well and was the head of their training department.<p>However, they brought in a new HR director and CEO that wanted to ""shake things up"" and the HR guy had a buddy from his former company that wanted to come in and work with him and happened to do a similar job that my dad did. You can probably guess what happened next, my father was fired without much of a reason. Those in executive positions that could have stood up for him were either in the minority or retired, so he had little help to back him up.<p>My family pushed him to sue, but he felt pressured into taking their severance package because he had to support my brothers and my mother and was worried about his prospects of getting a job in his 50s at another company (despite having a Bachelor's and Master's degree from well-known schools). He ended up taking the severance and waived his right to sue (at least according to the agreement he signed). He was also afraid that suing would blacklist him from employment elsewhere and it was hard for him to bring himself to sue the business he once loved. Coming from the age when many were loyal to their companies, even if the company was not loyal to them, he just couldn't do it.<p>Since then, he's applied at numerous employers for similar jobs to his own as well as other ones he could segue into. However, no one wants to hire him basically because of his age despite no intentions of retiring anytime soon. Now, he works a low wage job he could get without a degree from a university and it just kills me to see him like that. My only wish is to eventually grow my own business enough I can hire him myself so he can do something more respectable. He's not a huge tech guy like me so getting him into software development with me is a bit more than possible, but he's a smart guy that would fit into many other business and training related roles. However, those roles are something I can't pay for when I'm either working for clients, my own projects or with a friend right now.<p>Although age discrimination is against the law in the US, it's much more complex than it appears for most cases and suing is a difficult question that could hurt as much as it could help. I've always been reluctant to talk about my father's ordeal, but I felt I had to get it off my chest at some point.<p>edit: few grammar errors",1360207926

You played this hapless guy  who escaped and explored worlds, with compelling confusion about who your enemies and friends were. It was dream-like and scary and mysterious and great.<p>Half-life 2 felt like you were being lead through a metaphorical tunnel the entire game. Literally some parts had NPCs reminding you to ""go this way"" for hour-long stretches. Most of the game wasn't escaping terrifying situations, instead it felt like you were merely ""in transit"". It's hard to have a thrilling feeling of excitement and horror as you're being nagged to get to the next plot device.<p>What's more, whereas in HL1 you were this scientist caught up in a mess, in HL2 you play essentially the role of a hired brute. You do zero Gordon-specific things. When you meet Barney at the start of the game, if you swapped bodies with Barney at that moment, <i>nothing in the game would have changed at all.</i> Congrats on that MIT degree the NPCs will remind you, now kindly plow through 6,000 bugs/zombies/cycloptic humans as we tell you what to do.<p>I have a inkling that the sour direction HL2 took is at least part of the reason they're having trouble with HL3 but who's to say. Most reviews say its one of the greatest games ever, so maybe I'm way off kilter.<p>Anyway, I think a Half-Life movie, if it covered any of the events in Half-Life 2 at all, would suffer severe problems if it tries to make a story of a mute scientist who kills his way to the 90th floor of Castle X to save the world. It's just not a very compelling story.<p>[1] I was lambasted for offering this opinion on Reddit.

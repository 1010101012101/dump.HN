For example, if Facebook created an algorithm that deleted accounts based on user skin color in their photos, it would be a human action.<p>2) Facebook is a highly sophisticated software company, not someone who downloaded a library without realizing quite what it did. They are especially responsible for what their algorithms do. (To think of it another way, imagine how they would look if they claimed otherwise, &#x27;we don&#x27;t really understand what our software does&#x27;.) EDIT: It&#x27;s also a consequence of priorities: If the algorithm&#x27;s quality had a billion dollar impact on their bottom line, there would be no errors.<p>3) Facebook isn&#x27;t just a private business. With so much power over the world&#x27;s political and social communication, they have an obligation to ensure their members freedom of speech.<p>4) Transparency and remediation is necessary for #3 (and maybe Facebook already has it; I don&#x27;t know).

A constant factor between 3 and 6 kills SRAM&#x27;s viability? DRAM is already over-provisioned by a factor of 2-4 even at the middle of the consumer spectrum just to support the &quot;use case&quot; of someone who can&#x27;t be bothered to close their tabs. Going back to the hand-wavey analogy, SSDs stormed the scene with a ~50x constant factor disadvantage:<p><a href=""http://www.kitguru.net/components/ssd-drives/anton-shilov/sandisk-to-release-8tb-ssd-in-2015-16tb-ssd-a-year-after/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.kitguru.net/components/ssd-drives/anton-shilov/sa...</a><p>If the only thing standing between SRAM and DRAM were a constant factor of <6, DRAM would already be history.<p>The most convincing explanation I&#x27;ve heard is that caches are so damn good at hiding latency that getting rid of row open/close just doesn&#x27;t matter. A few minutes of googling suggests that they often run at a 95% hit rate on typical workloads and a 99% hit rate on compute workloads. You would still need a cache even with main memory as SRAM to hide transit-time, permission checking, and address translation latency, so SRAM main memory wouldn&#x27;t actually free up much die space, it would just make your handful of misses a bit faster (well, it would free up the scheduler / aggregator, but not the cache itself). The reason why I called this one &quot;most convincing&quot; rather than &quot;convincing&quot; is that even with a 99% hit rate a single miss has such atrocious latency that it would seem to matter.",1438438560

There were about 10k less men, and about 8k less women graduating in 1996 compared to 1986. The number eventually rebounded for men, but didn&#x27;t recover for women until 2003. So something drove men and women out of the field, and women stayed out of it longer.<p>The next interesting thing is the number of masters and PhDs per gender. Neither of them dropped (so the percentage of BS graduates getting MS and PhD actually increased!). So it was still desirable for men and women in the field to get their masters and doctorates.<p>So the question isn&#x27;t why the number of women plunged, it&#x27;s what drove both men and women out of CS, and what caused it to grow for men? I would probably hypothesis that CS was seen as a risky degree, so while men are generally less adverse to risk (see all the dangerous jobs they do) and got a degree, women choose more stable degrees (though those interested remained, as I think the number of PhD and Master degrees show). Now that CS is now seen as a stable career, we can see there is more interest to join.

Nope, all you need is a half-way decent mobile app and some people with cars. Yes, the bigger your fleet the larger an area you can cover, but there&#x27;s no need to serve an entire metropolitan area if covering just some of it is enough to turn a profit. (For example, if I were going to enter the ride-for-hire market in NYC today, I&#x27;d put all my drivers at JFK, Laguardia, and Times Square.)<p>Artificial barriers to entry? There used to be, in the form of TLC monopolies and regulations around medallions. The nice thing about Uber&#x27;s success, though, is that they&#x27;re bearing the brunt of breaking down these barriers, leaving the path open for those that will follow.<p>Network effects? Mmm...some, but only for those that travel frequently. That is, if you often find yourself in a new city, your first act might be to open the Uber app because you can count on them providing service in a new, unfamiliar local. I&#x27;d wager that&#x27;s the minority of ride-for-hire customers, though. Each city has its own local mass transit, and there hasn&#x27;t been a push to standardize across regions. (Though wouldn&#x27;t it be nice if your Metro Card worked on BART?)<p>On the flip-side, I see <i>a lot</i> of opportunity for new competitors to differentiate themselves. For example, let&#x27;s say you decide to focus on the &quot;regular customer&quot;: someone who travels roughly the same route most days of the week, a commuter or someone with a daily or semi-weekly appointment to keep. Imagine you could tune your service to get the same driver for these customers most days. Now you have a familiar face picking you up, who knows where you&#x27;re going, what route you prefer, what station you like on the radio, etc. If I was that customer, I&#x27;d take that service over Uber in a heart-beat.<p>So, again, why should it be winner-takes-all?",1438437717

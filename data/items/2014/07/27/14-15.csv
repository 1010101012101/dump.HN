Different graphs using the same color scheme to represent slightly different sized bins of what may or may not be the same measure. Lower to higher is left to right. But on a different graph it&#x27;s right to left. No explanation of time period for Revenue Distribution graph. Choice of graph type seems somewhat arbitrary. Donut charts and stacked bar charts become harder to interpret as the number of bins go up and the trend line gets buried. The colors seem to be the dominant feature of the graphic.<p>Plain old bar charts might be boring, but they would have more clearly communicated the message without all the extra distractions. They would also allow the graphic to use fewer code and require fewer text (legends could be omitted). At least they did specific actual graph values in the graphs. The area graph shows how one color can be effective when the graph contains only one type of data element.<p>Lesson here is to think carefully and make conscious choices about how you communicate your message. It&#x27;s true in pitching an investor, pitching a customer, or presenting to an audience. Make sure your message gets through. Otherwise you just have a bunch of graphs dropped on a page and the reader has to search for what you&#x27;re trying to say.<p>Also, hire a designer. You&#x27;ll be happier.",1406472738

The difference being the degree of anxiety experienced seems to be particularly acute for a minority of Japanese tourists in Paris.<p>Anthropologists and ethnographers are trained in, and can experience severe culture shock since their goal is often immersion to learn more about a culture. Panic attacks in severe cases of culture shock are not uncommon, one of my professors did a stint in Spain and lost it when she saw a slaughtered pig being carried through a market place. She described being short of breath, and other classic symptoms of a panic attack.<p>Another instance I know of is a Japanese American female anthropologist being immersed into Japanese culture while staying as a guest at a family. She found herself panicking  at the supermarket. After nearly a year there, dressed in &quot;homewear&quot; with a stroller and the family&#x27;s children looking to buy food to make for the night&#x27;s dinner, in the midst of the crushing social obligations she had such an identity crisis right then and there that she abandoned ship and moved in with a friend she knew in Tokyo.

But if we don&#x27;t need to worry about double spends, we wouldn&#x27;t need Bitcoin in the first place. Bitcoin solves the double spend problem, which takes, roughly 60 minutes.<p>> Wait ten minutes for anonymous senders.<p>A single confirmation is not sufficient for large-value transfers. The larger the transfers the longer one should wait (up to about 6 confirmations).<p>A miner with, say, 5% of the global hashing power has a 5% chance of finding the next block. That means someone working with the miner has a 5% chance of successfully pulling off a 1-confirmation double spend. If I transfer 100,000 BTC to someone as payment for something, and the recipient delivers to me a product worth 100,000 BTC after one confirmation, then I have a 5% chance of successfully scamming someone of something worth 100,000 BTC (~$60M). That&#x27;s an average profit per attempt of 5,000 BTC (~$3M).<p>If I instead wait, say, 7 confirmations (~65 minutes), the probability of pulling of a successful double spend with 5% of the network hash rate is around 0.000000078%.

The salt deposits in the mine that WIPP occupies are precipitate from this sea drying down and are very deep.<p>If the site were collapsed (which I understand it will be at some point) people with primitive tools won&#x27;t be digging it back up. It is simply too deep. It isn&#x27;t going to erode down to the level they can either in any reasonable period of time....i.e. millions of years. A society technologically advanced to dig this stuff up presumably will be aware of some history and/or be able to decipher what is written on the marker.

How about versus working at Google or Apple?<p>From their perspective, the purpose of your work is to enrich their platform. The difference is in the distribution of payout and work conditions. Rather than having a stable 100k salary at said company, you have the chance to earn absolutely nothing, or be an outlier and beat the 100k. Is it worth it, by expected value? Well, according to the article numbers,<p>Expected Monthy Payout = 24%<i>0 + 23%</i>50 (using half of max of ranges) + 22%<i>500 + 19%</i>5000 + 9%<i>50K + 3%</i>200K (using double the greatest lower limit)<p>Which gives an expected monthly payout of $11,600.

There are few app developers pulling that $100K or so salary. Instead, two thirds of everyone is below poverty, and a select group are killing it.

If your neighbor is thinking about how to make a bomb, or how to kill someone, or how to commit suicide, or how to defraud and deceive others, wouldn&#x27;t it be better if the secret police put a stop to it there?\n> We could live in a post-crime society. Where everyone is un-corruptable and all humans treat each other as lovingly as we treat our own bodies. The problem with this is that the secret police only enforce the rules of the rulers, which has a thicker script for the lower classes than the upper classes.<p>In the past, philosophers have been discussing about &quot;The problem of evil&quot;[0] - which is the paradox of an omnibenevolent, omniscient, and omnipotent God allowing (morally) evil to exist. Obviously, it&#x27;s normally discussed in a theological context, but one argument would apply to a non-theological context as well: the defense of free will. Since free will is the more important/ preferable than non-existent of evil, you can&#x27;t have human with free will but without the choice of being evil. So as long as free will exists, you will have to be content with having evil/ crime etc as well.<p>Just to be clear, &quot;evil&quot; in the previous paragraph is being used in the sense of morally bad, and not the invisible, flying, human-haunting type.<p>[0]: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Problem_of_evil"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Problem_of_evil</a>",1406471041

The existing founders have conceived of a product, prototyped it, and validated it in the most significant way possible - with customers who are willing to not just pay for it, but pay for it far in advance.<p>Let me put this in perspective: on Kickstarter, raising $100,000 puts a company in the top 0.2% of <i>successful</i> campaigns [1]. If you include all campaigns, they&#x27;re rarer than 1-in-a-thousand. Due to selection bias, we hear about these >$100k campaigns preferentially, but the company is breathing rarified air. That indicates there&#x27;s real value that&#x27;s already been created by the founders.<p>That said, 2% and a smidge over minimum wage isn&#x27;t right either.

8092780,comment,8092493,8092493,11,0,MehdiEG,,,"I was on the other side of this equation a couple of years ago - co-founder of a London-based tech startup that had just finished an accelerator and raised a £100k round of seed funding (we didn&#x27;t make it in the end in case you&#x27;re wondering). Here are a few tips from what we learned.<p>1) The valuation is completely and utterly meaningless at this stage of the company. Unless the company is already generating a profit, it&#x27;s currently worth exactly $0. So forget about the valuation when making this decision.<p>In addition, as you mentioned in your description, this valuation is literally a completely random number they pulled out of thin air.<p>Just for your reference, London-based startups that raise a seed round after having completed an accelerator are typically valued in the region of £1m. They would have to be quite exceptional to be valued at $3-4m (and maybe they are - up to you to find out).<p>2) I&#x27;m no expert on what&#x27;s a reasonably equity share for a first employee. 2% sounds OK. But in any case, those 2% are worth exactly nothing right now. And at the stage they&#x27;re at, their chances of success are close to non-existant (just like every other startup at this stage). So those 2% will most likely never be worth anything. Take those 2% as the icing on the cake, not as a main decision factor.<p>3) The £1.4k / month salary figure is a bit odd. Salaries in the UK are usually expressed as a gross annual figure, not as a monthly figure (or at least that how I&#x27;ve always seen them expressed). So do they mean a salary of £16.8k gross or £20.3k gross?<p>In any case, since it&#x27;s a remote position, you&#x27;re the only one who knows whether this is a reasonable offer or not. In the UK, that would be far, far too low for an intermediate-senior level developer. Even in the parts of the UK that have the lowest salaries (e.g. Northern Ireland), £17k would be borderline taking the piss for a graduate-level position, let alone senior.<p>But then again, only you knows what you could expect to earn where you live.<p>4) What accelerator did they go through? The purpose of an accelerator is mainly to &quot;get the badge&quot;, i.e. get the credibility associated with the accelerator and get accepted into the &quot;inner circle&quot; of entrepreneurs and investors in the region. This is what makes a huge difference to the startup&#x27;s ability to raise future funding and get the right introductions.<p>As a result, the only accelerators that are worth going through and provide real value are the top-ones, namely: YC, 500 Startups and TechStars. So are they part of the inner circle or did they just go through a small, fairly unknown local accelerator?<p>5) Since they haven&#x27;t yet raised seed round, they probably don&#x27;t yet have a formal board of directors. So failing this, who are their &quot;official&quot; advisors? Do they have any high-profile, successful entrepreneur helping them out (i.e. someone who&#x27;s been there before)? Ask to have a chat with one of them. If their advisors are really willing to help them and are not just advisors on paper, they&#x27;ll be very happy to have a chat with a prospective employee #1. Be blunt with them - ask them what they think of the company, of the founders and of their future prospects.<p>6) Finally, I realise that the above might come across as quite negative but this isn&#x27;t my intention. There&#x27;s plenty of upside with being employee #1 at a tech startup, even when the salary is questionable.<p>- It&#x27;s common in early stage startups to be very relaxed and flexible when it comes to working hours, days off, etc. especially given the very low salary they&#x27;re offering. Have a honest chat with them about this.<p>- If you&#x27;re genuinely interested in startups, there&#x27;s not better way to learn the ropes than to be employee #1 at a tech startups. You&#x27;ll learn almost as much as you would being a founder and you&#x27;ll be paid for it!<p>- Although your 2% will probably never be worth anything, there is a good chance that the company will grow enough to see its team reach a sizeable size. As employee #1, you&#x27;ll be first in line to move up the chain of command and to be given a lot of responsibilities. You&#x27;ll probably learn more in two years in a startup than you would have in 10 years at a large corporation. That certainly won&#x27;t hurt your CV.<p>All of the above however is conditional on the founders being completely open and honest with you and on you having an excellent relationship with them. So up to you to see whether you and the founders &quot;clicked&quot; and whether they&#x27;re going to be open with you or keep you at arm&#x27;s length.",1406470358

They&#x27;re young kids, not even old enough to drink, and in large part they come from circumstances where they had little opportunity or were surrounded by an environment that didn&#x27;t respect following the rules, doing good work, and working well with others.<p>SO when you talk about the cultural problem you believe exists within the military, I&#x27;d like to remind you that the military is largely composed of people who are not far removed from the civilian culture they grew up in.  You get former gang-bangers in the Army, religious nuts in the Air Force, and so on.<p>So if there are problems in our military culture, it&#x27;s because there are problems in our culture as a whole.  The military doesn&#x27;t change points of view, correct deep psychological problems or reverse trauma, eliminate racist leanings or homophobia.  It does NONE of those things.  What it does effectively is train people to work as a team and follow rules to get things done.  It&#x27;s VERY effective at that.<p>To take one of your examples: Guantanamo.  When was the last time you heard the actual voting public railing to get that gulag closed?  Did you hear about a write-in campaign to Congress?  How about a media blast to educate the public about what it&#x27;s really like there?<p>You didn&#x27;t.  That&#x27;s because the public wants it to exist.  Congress made it impossible to close Guantanamo based on the politics of giving people actual trials in the USA.<p>You seem to labor under the idea that the military goes off on its own and decides to do things that shock the conscience.  It doesn&#x27;t.  It follows orders from the civilian leadership.  The CIVILIAN leadership.  And that leadership often sucks ass.  From the President to the Congress, getting good leaders that care about how the military goes about doing its job and HOW it does it is so rare as to be an anomaly in my country&#x27;s history.<p>edit: spelling.",1406470269

It requires a certain minimum BTC price to move a certain amount of money when settling in bitcoin.

So the bitcoin price measured in a certain currency limits the maximum transaction volume for that currency when settling in bitcoin.<p>Secondly, and perhaps more importantly, it requires great liquidity/market depth. One must be able to buy or sell a lot of bitcoins without affecting the price. This is the essence of money: a high-liquidity commodity.<p>> I guess I mean &quot;valuable&quot; in the intrinsic sense, not the financial sense.<p>When settling in bitcoins, they <i>need</i> to have value in &quot;the financial sense&quot;.

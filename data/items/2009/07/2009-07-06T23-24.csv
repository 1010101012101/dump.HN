Looks like he had a telecom background, so he was probably working on the architecture of their co-located trading platform.  In the automated trading world, co-location means putting your machines at the exchange to reduce the latency of receiving market data and entering orders.  For a high frequency strategy (i.e. tens or hundreds of thousands of trades per day), these improvements can really increase profits, and there is a huge arms race under way in industry to get the lowest latency.",1246924706

Now, it's possible that you want to finish the project you're working on, or for some other reason you don't mind doing it. But, honestly, most of the time if you decided to quit, you're mentally checked out or even worse, hostile toward the company. And it's not as if two weeks is a long time, the employer can't get anyone to replace you that fast anyway. The company often has no obligation to give you any notice either. Now, you don't need to be flip about quitting, you can just say politely that you don't think it's working out for you, that you can't give 2 weeks notice because you need to use the time to take a break before the next gig starts, or that you won't be doing a good enough job or whatever. I think most normal people (co-workers) understand that you have to take care of yourself. That said, in my past I've given up up to six month notice, mostly because I've been lucky to work on great projects and with great people that I didn't want to undermine. But if you're not in that situation, I don't think that there are any _ethical_ considerations in quitting ASAP.",1246924093

Each side is protected by instant-kill bots/drones, like any other mmorpg, certain areas are protected by bots so enemies (PvE or PvP) don't come to close, to protect the lower level players or who just appeared.<p>Apparently he sat close to one of his faction's drone, targetted an enemy player, and teleported the enemy close to him, causing an instant drone kill.<p>Now, something like this happening once or twice is a PITA, but the article gives the impression that he did to several players, in the course of many, many weeks. It was probably very boring for him too, since drone kills usually don't give any reward.<p>What I find strange, the whole thing is a textbook example of griefing, and the CoH/V admins didn't do anything to stop him. Sure, it was inside the game mechanics, but a complete distortion of any intended PvP design.<p>Also, a little map rearrangement or some kind of ""when teleported by an enemy, the player is immune to drone kills during 10 seconds"" power change should have stopped this form of griefing completely.<p>Which makes me think, if the admins and devs didn't do anything, this whole thing was way less destructive than the professor wants us to believe.

It's confounded by things such as the fact that many of the groups that are vegetarian also essentially engage in calorie restriction (which has been shown in controlled animal studies to work).  Meat eating, however, hasn't even been shown in animal studies to necessarily be bad, because it entirely depends on the animal (feed meat to a rabbit, bad things happen, feed grains to a cat, bad things happen). Cultures that engage in significant meat eating also tend to eat a lot of sugar, trans-fats, and other things.  These studies are far from conclusive as a result.<p>Observational studies that are peer reviewed and exhaustive can yield results that are entirely opposite reality.  Dozens of <i></i>peer reviewed, exhaustive<i></i> observational studies told doctors that hormone replacement therapy reduced the incidence of heart attacks.  Only after 16,000 women were enrolled in a double-blind controlled trial of hormone-replacement therapy in the 90s (after 6 million women had received the therapy) did we learn that heart disease, breast cancer, stroke, and dementia actually were more common in people receiving hormone replacement therapy vs placebo.  In other words, the exact opposite.<p>Epidemiology is only of value in formulating hypotheses, not in proving anything.",1246923434

The only thing that has a clear relationship with extending lifespan is calorie restriction. The rest is very very unclear.<p>This guy finds a population, finds one thing they do that supports his preconceived notions of what makes you live longer, and then says that this population's behavior in this respect proves that this action makes you live longer.<p>So he finds a vegetarian culture that lives long and says OK vegetarianism makes you live longer. He finds a culture that drinks a lot of alcohol and says OK, alcohol doesn't limit longevity.<p>He finds a culture that eats a balanced diet, a culture that exercises a lot, etc. etc.<p>None if this is really any type of proof, and if you examine many different cultures, you will find his evidence is contradicted by other cultures (meat eating cultures that live longer and have fewer health problems than nearby vegetarian cultures, for instance).<p>Our knowledge of what helps humans to live the longest possible life is, sadly, very limited still.",1246921329

It would have been more interesting if he had done something non-mainstream that did not impact on other players and seen if it would have gotten any abuse.<p>After all this is the essence of tolerance in real life - nobody expects you to be tolerant towards people who are shooting you; tolerance comes from a ""live and let live"" approach.

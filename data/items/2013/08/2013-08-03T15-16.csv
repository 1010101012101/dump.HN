I&#x27;ve even taken a spill with it. Not once has it come close to failing. And yet, it only takes a second to get the phone on and off.<p>The kit comes with four rubber o-rings: two small, two large. I think you&#x27;re only expected to use two (whichever&#x27;s the best fit for your bike). But I use all four: the small ones straight across, the large ones diagonally. Works great.<p>As for the case, I&#x27;ve never used one in the past, preferring the feel of a naked iPhone. But the QL case is thin and nice enough to the touch that I don&#x27;t bother removing it. I rather like it now. The kit also includes a water resistant (but still touch sensitive) cover, which has worked well for me in the rain a few times.<p>So yeah, I&#x27;m a huge fan. I&#x27;ve actually ordered a second one for my other bike.",1375545587

6152436,comment,6151748,6152367,2,0,sampo,,,"Well, true, but the amount of water vapor in the atmosphere is determined by the balance of (i) water vapor condensing back to liquid water (e.g. rain), and (ii) water evaporating to atmosphere from oceans, lakes, soils and ecosystems. This balance is mostly determined by the temperature.<p>So you can&#x27;t really add much water to the atmosphere by only emitting water vapor by e.g. burning gas, or even boiling huge amounts of water, because the excess water vapor will just condense back to liquid water.<p>Also if we imagine some huge industrial process that dries the air, removes water vapor from the air, this wouldn&#x27;t really decrease the amount of water vapor in the atmosphere, because the drier air would just suck up the water back when it next comes into contact with a water body, damp soil or vegetation.",1375545404

6152429,comment,6150535,6150877,2,0,lnanek2,,,"Wonder how easy it would be to turn off gzip on just potential attacks. It takes a lot of requests to execute the attack after all. So an example where each user only got their response gzipped the first time for any URL would be safe. But then the site would slow down for them later. So you&#x27;d have to pick some sort of reset metric that prevented efficient attacks, but still gave users compressed data most of the time.<p>Another piece of low hanging fruit would be to change the session cookie every request. It isn&#x27;t a big deal for most servers to update the session ID and send a cookie down each request. Meanwhile it would hurt attacks going after the session ID by methods like this that need a lot of requests with the same value a lot.",1375545309

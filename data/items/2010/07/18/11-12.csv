1525621,comment,1523702,1525473,0,0,jashkenas,,,"Glad you mentioned that point. The distinction between '=' and '==' in most programming languages is a personal pet peeve of mine. I think that it confuses two separate issues: labeling a value with a name, and testing the equality of values. Terrifically confusing stuff if you're coming from algebra.<p>So, although '=' is available to make transitioning from other languages smoother, idiomatic CoffeeScript would use ':' for assignment, both within and outside of object literals, and would use 'is' for equality. Harder to make a bug out of:<p><pre><code>    if x is y</code></pre>",1279454346

There are lots of things I want to do, and they all take time.  I particular, I don't have time to watch this.

1525606,comment,1525240,1525589,0,0,Mz,,,"Probably the most obvious is that men are less touchy-feely.  I find that in female-majority environments, there is much more lie-to-your-face while stabbing you in the back type behavior.  I'm a real blunt individual, which often goes over poorly with women (my dad and ex-husband are both career military and my mom is foreign -- so, to be fair, lots of Americans find me hard to take/hard to really understand, not just women).  The flip side of that is that people here seem to make less effort to understand my admittedly ""alien"" perspective.  It feels to me more like it is on me to work at communicating effectively.  I'm okay with that because I find that pat-you-on-the-head and be nice to you stuff often doesn't really result in better communication.  Like a pain killer, it often just masks the fact there is a big problem. Men seem to be better about bluntly letting you know it's an issue -- which can be very uncomfortable to face but, in the long run, is usually more productive.<p>Of course, since I am female, I find that when I do the exact same thing a man would do, it is often interpreted by other people as ""overly aggressive"".  So time will tell if I will be able to take the lessons learned here and put them to constructive use in my life.",1279453462

The French army is often written off because it was quickly beaten by Germany in 1940, but at the time it was at least as good qualitatively, and vastly bigger, than the British ansd American armies. It's at least arguable that Britain and America only won that war because they had good natural defences -- the English channel for Britain, and the Atlantic and Pacific oceans for the USA.",1279453054

1525592,comment,1524757,1525336,0,0,Mz,,,"I have two ASD kids and a serious medical condition.  I took a lot of medication for a few years and ultimately concluded that the drug side effects were more impairing than my illness.  I've worked extremely hard to get off the drugs.  I resisted suggestions to put my oldest on Ritalin (by a teacher, who apparently just didn't want to deal with my highly energetic, inquisitive kid and wasn't qualified to diagnose anything).<p>Stuff I have seen suggests that nutritional supplements generally work better and without the drug side effects.  Having gotten off of a bunch of medication, I have found that my need for nutritional supplements has gone down.  It is well documented that some drugs cause deficiencies of specific nutrients.  I sort of suspect that part of the way these drugs get the initial positive impact is by squeezing the body for use of these nutrients, thereby giving a short-term boost but, in the long term, using them up and resulting in worse problems.  If that suspicion is at all accurate, finding the right nutritional supplements should be generally more effective -- and, in fact, for me and my sons, that has proven to be true.  (Deeper still is finding the roots of such issues and addressing those, but probably not really within the scope of this discussion. :-))",1279452762

1525590,comment,1524695,1525567,0,0,teilo,,,">folk like this make a big noise about nothing of significance.<p>It is not ""nothing of significance"" that CRU could not reproduce their own results because they destroyed their intermediate data and failed to document how they produced it. His criticism on this point is spot-on. What happened with CRU is a travesty, even though, as you say, the underlying science did not change. The people who should be the most vocal about the CRU mess are those scientists who have concluded that AGW is real. But instead, the response is, over and over, ""This is no big deal. Move along."" In so doing they have only increased the suspicion of the skeptics, and added fuel to the fire of the deniers.<p>And so what you say of ""these people"" actually applies to those he criticizes. Scientists do science. When they do politics and public relations instead of science, they do it badly. When critics arise, what they <i>should</i> do in answer the critics with science. But when they answer with dogma and PR spin, they, to use your words, ""create an impression of the science being faulty by bringing up details that are not scientific.""<p>The science isn't popular? Sorry, but that's too bad. It's not the job of scientists to popularize and defend their data and conclusions with anything but more science. Stick to the science. The truth will out.",1279452711

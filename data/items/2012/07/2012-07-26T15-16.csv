There could not be a more natural concept of organization. It corresponds to a box inside a storage box inside a closet inside a room inside a house inside a neighborhood, etc. It's just every level is called a folder. Saying that ""x"" group of people ""can't understand"" that is just insulting to them, frankly.<p>2) People who use a flat directory to save 1000's of invoices on a computer which is only used for that, who do not understand folders -- that's fine. This doesn't prove folders are non-intuitive. They just don't <i>need</i> to understand folders, because the job doesn't require folders. The moment their job does, someone can explain it to them, and they will get it, the same way they get that paperclips go in the box on the shelf in the closet.<p>3) The original Mac OS (say, up to System 6) did a great job of making folders understandable. They were physical icons, physical window locations, they were easy to use. The Open/Save dialogs could be a bit confusing, and still are -- there's definitely room for improvement there.<p>4) Modern OS's do a <i>terrible</i> job at making folders understandable, because there are drive directories, often hidden, and then multiple user folders, and their Documents directories, and then things <i>outside</i> their Documents directories (like Desktop, Downloads, etc.), and fake folders that show the content of multiple other folders, etc.<p>5) So people are rightly claiming that folders are a mess and  confusing. Yes they are, on modern OS's. But the problem is not with the concept of folders, it's with their back-assward modern implementations. So don't throw the baby out with the bathwater and claim that folders are bad. Instead, the solution is:<p>6) Modern OS's and apps: stop trying to organize our damned files for us! Stop auto-creating ""Downloads"" and ""My Pictures"" and ""My Skype Photos"" and ""My Virtual Machines"" directories. Just stop it! Instead, give each user their own home directory, have it be <i>empty</i> on a new computer, have every application open/save things in it by default (including downloads), and let the user organize things gradually as they see fit. And don't let anyone but a power user ever get outside of this directory.<p>(And ideally, stop allowing users to put documents on their desktop -- it just confuses things and nobody has ever come up with an intuitive way to integrate that with the concept of user folders (my desktop is <i>inside</i> my user folder, what?). Documents on a desktop is an outgrown metaphor that just nobody seems to have the courage to jettison.)",1343317355

They are always a product of both the observer's bias and the systemic bias of the environment in which they operate. I didn't immigrate here, which changes how I experience the place, and as someone who tends to work for 5 to 10 years at a place the half dozen places I have direct experience at are a small fraction of the total number of companies.<p>The effect I've observed is that Silicon Valley has such mobility (which is to say between jobs) and such commonality between business structure, that the larger companies get, the less pronounced their differences become. I attribute that to the challenge of assimilating folks into the company culture that is too far off the valley 'mainstream.' It also provides a tremendous amount of cross fertilization where people say ""Oh at my old company we used to do X"" and if its a better thing than what the locals do it has a good chance of being adopted. So management techniques, office layouts, and programming methodologies have a sort of viral nature to them as well.

It will include everything that doesn't need server side support and expense. I actually hope most customers choose this, the other items are there largely to justify the pricing of this item.<p>Ads and anonymous usage monitoring will come in releases after the purchases have become available and for ads I will probably make the first month of use add free to try and get the user stuck in. I may also add some alternate skins as in-app purchases too later although that is lower priority than using the iOS 6 social framework as a way to try to get users promoting the app for me by sharing lists.<p>There is currently no item limit so I will allow users with more than 50 current items to have their initial limit be 50 higher than the current level.<p>At the moment this is just a small scale test because I haven't done any promotion for the app yet so the current numbers of users is small although the reviews are currently very good (4.5* average in US and UK) (despite a usability issue leading someone not to work out how to reorder items and give it only 3*- but I'll add some help in the release after next).<p>To become self sustaining as an independent developer I'm expecting to need to keep a small suite of apps ticking over. Some will be more ambitious than this although others may be even simpler with different unique features or niche target markets.<p>My wife is in employed work so the time flexibility of being independent is important to cover childcare around school hours than making massive money in the short term so I can take some time to build (knowledge and users)<p>Any thoughts on the pricing model?

I think it's superior than other existing ones in the market, such as InstaPad and the hot Pinstagram.<p>Yes, Pinstagram is similar with us, but we're not a copycat. We're inspired by Pingram.me not Pinstagram.co. While we failed in moving fast enough and the weird App Store review cost us 25 days...<p>Compared with Pinstagram, we're confident in interaction design. For example, checking others' profile is often used on iPad. It's not easy in Pinstagram but in InstaPad, it's one single tap.<p>So guys, do you think InstaPin has a chance? Could you give some suggestions of how to market it to be a success.<p>InstaPin is here: http://itunes.apple.com/cn/app/instapin-creatively-explore/id539297584?l=en&mt=8, you can also check screenshots there<p>Thanks in advance,",1343315315

Did you ever see deploying to Windows servers? There's a reason AppHarbor's documentation pages are so much smaller than Heroku's: Deploying a .NET web app is peanuts. Through Microsoft-only-means, it's done with a single buttonclick from Visual Studio. This works <i>really</i> great. There's a convention as to how web applications are structured that is very widespread and supported by all relevant tooling.<p>Really, there may be many reasons for not choosing .NET for cloud apps, but server support is not one of them.<p>Secondly, you're forgetting a major category for .NET developers: devices. Office multifunctional printers, cash registers, machines in factories, any mid to high tech equipment really. Windows has a massive market share here, and lock-in is only one of the reasons why this is going to remain. For example, developing a touch screen interface for an ATM using WPF is very, very easy - definitely among the best options out there. The entire world may be moving to the web, but for devices there is no strong benefit in doing so. Why make a built-in webserver and a windowlwss browser if you can just make a decent native app in half the time, using half the resources? Also, the price of a Windows Embedded license isn't very interesting if the device you're selling costs a few thousand dollars a piece.<p>Admittedly though, I've no idea how small or large the dev market of machines and equipment is. But it's really pretty sizeable, much bigger than the average HN world-vision warrants.<p>A lot of software is never seen by consumers, don't forget that.

4296281,comment,4294265,4295889,3,0,irahul,,,"> Quite a bit of SICP would be awkward to translate into a language that doesn't support TCO, such as Clojure.<p>>> Clojure doesn't have implicit tail call but it does have loop-recur and trampoline. SICP can be followed quite easily in Clojure.<p>>>> <a href=""http://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/full-text/book/book-Z-H-11.html.."" rel=""nofollow"">http://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/full-text/book/book-Z-H-11.html...</a>.
This section relies on TCO. I realize that it could be translated, but I do not feel that this could be done without heavy modification. Besides that, basically the section's goal is to explain TCO.<p>This is the scheme implementation:<p><pre><code>  (define (factorial n)
    (fact-iter 1 1 n))

  (define (fact-iter product counter max-count)
    (if (> counter max-count)
        product
        (fact-iter (* counter product)
                  (+ counter 1)
                  max-count)))

</code></pre>
And this is the analogous(but not idiomatic) clojure:<p><pre><code>  (defn fact-iter [product counter max-count]
    (if (> counter max-count)
      product
      (recur (* counter product) (inc counter) max-count)))

  (defn factorial [n]
    (fact-iter 1 1 n))
</code></pre>
There are no heavy modifications.<p>> Besides that, basically the section's goal is to explain TCO.<p><pre><code>  def fact_iter(product, counter, max_count)
    return product if counter > max_count
    fact_iter (counter * product), (counter + 1), max_count
  end

  def fact(n)
    fact_iter 1, 1, n
  end
</code></pre>
Now Ruby doesn't have TCO. But how does it stop you from understanding TCO, and how to implement them if the runtime supports it?<p>I read SICP some time ago, and didn't do all the exercises, but as far as I recall, chapters 1-3 can easily be followed in Clojure, Ruby, JS...",1343314845

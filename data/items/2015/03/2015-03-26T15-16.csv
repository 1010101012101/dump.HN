At least in the teardowns I&#x27;ve seen here on HN, the companies make big mistakes, market it like they are perfect, and are arrogant regarding fixing things.<p>If companies launched with a real crypto review, this wouldn&#x27;t happen. On the flip side, most companies wouldn&#x27;t launch at all because their product is simply inherently insecure. Or, it addresses a mostly useless threat model. For instance, it requires you to trust their server while claiming to be super duper secret.<p>Even Silent Circle, which touts some famous names, talks up their secure PSTN service which is so obviously interceptable it&#x27;s bizarre to make any security claim at all.<p>The problem with crypto your mum can use is that key management is a pain in the ass. And if users don&#x27;t verify and maintain their own keys, most systems are useless against strong threats. zRTP is the closest thing to great, because there&#x27;s a simple in-but-out-of-band key verification system built in.<p>And if you day your mum doesn&#x27;t need <i>that</i> much security, she just doesn&#x27;t wanna be in a dragnet or have her ISP read her email, then choosing, say, Gmail, and emailing other users with TLS-enabled SMTP servers gets her pretty damn far (if SMTP actually verified certs).

E.g. maybe they just don&#x27;t have a clue what a dictionary is, yet won&#x27;t admit it.<p>* People making a lot of assumptions and not articulating them.  This tends to manifest as a really specific question that doesn&#x27;t make sense.  E.g. &quot;I tried to build a spellchecker and dictionary is not returning the right thing.&quot;  Then it turns out they assumed dictionary was prepopulated with the English language.  This is even worse if the person can&#x27;t/won&#x27;t explain their thought process when prompted.<p>* Not reading any of the docs.  I ran programming tutorials at one point and it was remarkable how many questions would have been answered by the introductory paragraphs of the tutorial if they&#x27;d read them instead of skipping it then spending 10 minutes struggling with a problem that didn&#x27;t make sense to them.<p>* Unwillingness to talk through things systematically, e.g. explaining code line-by-line.  It&#x27;s surprising how often people will ask for help, then lose patience with you once you want them to spend any amount of time explaining things.  This is enormously effective - half the time they realize their mistake on their own.",1427385461

9270529,comment,9268000,9268579,0,0,schoen,,,"In the U.S. from about 1999 to 2013, we heard quite a lot about Chinese state control and monitoring of the Internet. In fact, it became a kind of paradigmatic, ideal example of a &quot;bad&quot; state that didn&#x27;t trust people and had to practice control and monitoring of communications. People would say that restrictive policies and proposals were &quot;like China&quot;, and that was a powerful way of criticizing them.<p>We also heard that the Chinese state was so disrespectful and unreasonable that it was hiring hackers (in the sense of people who break security) and hacking computers all over the world. This was also an example of its commitment to control and monitoring of communications, and its unwillingness to let people have freedom and autonomy.<p>Since then we learned that Western states are also committed to having the technical means to control and monitor the Internet, although the policies for which they apply these means have usually been different. (The Western states almost never want people to <i>know</i> that they&#x27;re watching, and they tolerate speech that might threaten social harmony much better.)<p>Now that we&#x27;re hearing about a wider range of states building up the tools to monitor and control Internet communications according to their various state policies, there will be an important challenge. Can we transfer the kind of outrage that we felt against the Chinese government to everyone else, or will state control of the Internet be normalized and accepted as inevitable? (The Chinese government often responded to criticism of its Internet control programs by arguing that all other governments did analogous things, maybe just in the context of somewhat different domestic legal systems, and that it was normal and inevitable for states to be able to know and control how people use computer networks.)",1427385308

For those cases the procedure works as intended (the door can be opened from the outside if the person on the inside really doesn’t react). I don’t think suicidal pilots were on the forefront of anyone’s mind.<p>In hindsight a policy of always having at least two people does seem preferable. (And, just a little reminder here: Just because someone is willing to fly a plane with 149 other people on board into a mountain doesn’t mean they would be willing to do other awful things, too, like acting violently in person against another person, for example a flight attendant. Preventing this kind of behavior may well be about putting in place many small hurdles.)<p>I think it’s pretty clear that people in the cabin should never be able to access the cockpit against the express will of people inside the cockpit (preventing scenarios in which someone violently forces someone with knowledge of how to access the cockpit – e.g. a pilot coming back from the toilet – to divulge that information and gaining access that way), so realistically you can only throw people at this problem – and throwing people at this problem is thankfully in this case relatively straightforward and shouldn’t really have any other negative consequences.

(I went 12 years before going into a startup but the earliest I&#x27;ve seen it be successful is 5, you have to know enough about running a company to make it work).<p>The reason the narrative is so skewed though is because you here stories about the successful founders but few about the marginal ones. You rarely hear about the person whose personal bankruptcy has made every part of their life that involves running a credit check harder.  For every successful billionaire founder there are THOUSANDS of millionaire employees.<p>The problem here is the notion &quot;big money&quot; and perceived inequity of distribution. But if you actually put everyone who identifies as a &quot;Founder&quot; in a group, and everyone who identifies as an &quot;Employee&quot; in a group, it is much more likely the people in the latter category will have retired early.",1427385210

Your random number generator could be biased. Your messages could be unauthenticated. You can accidentally create an oracle from observable behavior. Your key exchange could be insecure. Your UX could be insecure, so it&#x27;s impossible to tell who you&#x27;re talking to. Your encryption could be off by default.<p>Of all the levels where modern cryptosystems are going to fail, <i>a catastrophic failure of the cipher itself is the least likely</i>. It is fantastically unlikely that a secure messaging app is going to fall because AES is broken. And the best fundamental attacks on the worst ciphers still make demands of attackers that are unrealistic for message apps.<p>So the whole idea of using a one time pad to secure a messaging app is alarming. It&#x27;s like an engineer told you they were going to design a bridge out of, I don&#x27;t know, lithium to save on weight.<p>There are lots of ways for a cryptosystem to fail. Unlike fundamental cipher breaks, which are so extraordinarily rare as to be discountable, some of them are <i>very, very</i> likely. In cryptography engineering, the way these problems are mitigated is to use standardized, well-known, well-tested constructions. Any time you leave the golden path --- an AEAD stream cipher construction --- you&#x27;re risking lots of flaws across every layer of your cryptosystem. Doing that to avoid an AES break is malpractice.<p>Also, as this post points out: this app didn&#x27;t even use an OTP. It used a stream cipher keyed by the HMAC-DRBG (iirc) embedded in JVM SecureRandom. So there&#x27;s that, too.",1427384968

If so, I wouldn&#x27;t worry so much, since that kind of experience only comes through time. Also, you&#x27;re a Junior Developer, you shouldn&#x27;t be expected to be an expert...yet :)<p>I do think it&#x27;s troubling that you think everyone you work with is unhelpful. This is not normal and sounds like a potentially toxic environment. I&#x27;d make sure this is the case though before jumping to conclusions. Maybe some are just busy or you&#x27;re asking for help at the wrong time (maybe try asking in advance through email/instant message and scheduling time on their calendar). Maybe it&#x27;s neither of those, but just giving the benefit of the doubt. How often are you asking for help and have you already tried other (easy) means of assistance like the web/documentation/etc? Do you take notes to avoid repeating yourself or forgetting what you learned when you do get assistance?<p>Those in your team though should be the most helpful though since in theory, they depend on you and you depend on them, so assistance is mutually beneficial. Sometimes I will leave a junior developer to work out something on their own when they have already been through a similar scenario before. It can be hard to resist (learned that was rarely the best idea when tutoring a friend in school) rushing in and helping them too quick, but I tell myself they&#x27;ll learn more if they try to think it through and refine those problem solving skills. In those cases, I have a pretty good idea that they know the answer, but it hasn&#x27;t clicked yet. I mean if they get stuck on it for too long, I&#x27;ll help them a long, but as a more senior developer you when you&#x27;re helping  and when you&#x27;re just doing their work for them (the later rarely helps them to learn/understand).<p>My other thought it&#x27;s maybe they&#x27;re not helpful because they just suck at communication. Not talking so much about general communication as much as trying to convey a complex topic to someone else in a way that is relevant to the person trying to understand. Some just don&#x27;t know as much as they claim about a subject to actually teach it to someone else or have the patience to do so.",1427384578

It may be the right decision to run away from these bitter jerks. But you may find that by focusing on your growth some of them may loosen up and help you grow. You can still learn from jerks, and as long as you stay growth mindset, you will surpass them over time. Patient focus and study! (If the environment however is truly toxic for you, then, yes, flee. If you flee, however, flee to an environment that is still challenging and has expertise that you can aggressively learn from.)<p>* Focus on your (future) self.

They assured us that the only reason they hadn&#x27;t had cable installed was the high cost they&#x27;d been quoted for running cable on the property (understandable as the house is almost 1/4 mile back from the street), and the cable company concurred that they&#x27;d be able to do the work, &quot;no problem,&quot; and quoted a fee that didn&#x27;t seem all <i>that</i> bad in the end (we took it into account when negotiating the price of the house).<p>Nevertheless, we made the sellers agree to a contingency - cable co. would successfully complete the work (on our dime, of course) and hook us up before the closing, and the total amount wouldn&#x27;t exceed what we had been quoted.  If the contingency wasn&#x27;t met, the sale would fall through and we&#x27;d get our deposit back.<p>That contingency clause relieved me of a lot of stress over the next few months.  Everything turned out OK in the end, but it was touch-and-go for a while.<p>Cable co. accepted the order with no problem, did a survey I guess, called us and said they wouldn&#x27;t be able to do it.  They were persuaded (not sure how -- agent took care of it) to reconsider, but then came back with a quote that was at least five times higher than before.  Cue lots of emails and phone calls.  It was helpful having an agent who lived in the community.  In the end a local contractor dug the trench for us at a very reasonable price, cable co. came down on their estimate, and the work actually was completed at just under the original quote.  The dirt was literally being shoveled back over the trench on the day of the closing.<p>As I recall it was actually a few days later that the cable guy came to do the inside wiring and &quot;flip the switch,&quot; so strictly speaking the contingency (cable installed and working) wasn&#x27;t satisfied by the closing, but we assumed we&#x27;d be OK at that point, and there were in fact no further hitches.  We moved in and have enjoyed a (mostly) reliable, fast connection ever since.  But we would absolutely have walked away, even though it was our &quot;dream house,&quot; had we not been able to get the cable pulled.  The contingency clause gave us the assurance that we could do that with no penalty.  And, had it turned out that the work <i>could</i> be done but only at 5x the price, we could potentially have used the clause to negotiate a concession from the seller to cover the costs.",1427384280

I did it for the experience, I didn&#x27;t even know JS, just C++ and some java. They thrown me into front end develpment in a framework I didn&#x27;t even know it existed. Some hard months came through. Some people where nice and humble, some well selfish and didn&#x27;t bother to explain anything.
So I kept on learning, started with JS, Html and CSS. I downloaded books and videos, read a lot of blogs (I got to know HN there and I am a user since), got into the world of develpment, started to ask questions on StackO, trying to answer some.
Latter got into Angular, ExtJs, mongo and many other stuff, I am glad I got in in the first place, the fact that I didn&#x27;t know anything and that I felt I didn&#x27;t belong made me study harder.
Nowadays I work there part time, got my first big project and some customer for it, and I am in charge in the whore software part. I got to realize that the software industry is a wide wide field, just look for something you feel confortable at and give your best.

We had a house not far from the bridge where there was no (and probably will never be) cell phone coverage by any provider, dsl also wasn&#x27;t an option, and comcast was the only game in town. You were lucky to get an FM/AM radio signal. Some of the problem is that houses are built sporadically outside Poulsbo and Bremerton proper - there really aren&#x27;t neighborhoods so much as somebody bought an acre in the woods and put a house on it.<p>But, this is certainly not isolated to Kitsap county or Comcast. Now I live in the other side of the state, in Walla Walla, and I assure you that Charter is just as bad, even when you pay for a business-class connection. It seems once you get outside Portland/Seattle, the population density isn&#x27;t such that the cable providers (or other potential internet providers) are much interested in the infrastructure investment. For the big guys like Comcast, Charter, etc - HQ is far far away and has <i>no idea</i> of the local situation. The only option I&#x27;ve found is to become buddies with the local field guys (and there are only like 2 for the 4 county area over here...).<p>Frankly, while the isolation and quiet of the peninsula is nice, you are better off selling your house anyway unless you are willing to hold it for 20+ years and hope that King/Pierce/Snohomish are finally so full that people have no choice but to move to Kitsap county. House sales are horribly slow and values barely move.",1427383832

9270247,comment,9269473,9269473,0,0,michaelochurch,,,"The ideal of Silicon Valley (and of the U.S. in general) is that <i>good-faith</i> business failure shouldn&#x27;t carry a lasting punishment. I like that. The last thing that I want is for us to become like many European and Asian societies where failure is shameful and often treated as permanent.<p>That said, the Valley&#x27;s true attitude toward failure is <i>deeply</i> classist. If you&#x27;re well-connected because your daddy golfs with VCs, then you can take big risks with your startup knowing that, even if it fails, they&#x27;ll just have it acqui-hired and give you another one. If you tire out in the pilot seat, they&#x27;ll make you a VP at Facebook or Google and it&#x27;s up to you whether you actually do any work for the next 3 years. This isn&#x27;t some general policy of tolerating good-faith failure by talented people. It&#x27;s protecting a social class. (Oh, and they excuse a lot of bad-faith failure, as well.)<p>On the other hand, if you&#x27;re from middle-class or lower origins, the results of failure in the Valley are very much Old World. I worked at Google 3 years ago, drew the manager with a 5-year history of using phony performance issues to tease out subordinates&#x27; health issues and then fucking with them. (I have cyclothymia, which sometimes produces hypergraphia.) Between that, and a quixotic attempt to save a major component of Google+ from complete failure (with a suggestion that had a lot of engineer support, and would have worked) I... ended up with more of a mailing-list presence than I should have had. You could say that this was a fuck-up on my part and you wouldn&#x27;t be wrong. And here&#x27;s the thing... 3 years later, I <i>still</i> get shit for it: job offers shot down, ill-informed comments about me on Hacker News, etc.<p>So excuse me when I say this, but fuck this classist double standard about failure. I had to fight through mountains of shit over a bunch of stupid mailing-list posts, most of which were dead-to-rights accurate, and that failed more because of their tone rather than content... but if you&#x27;re rich and well-connected and cause a company to melt down, ending 150 jobs, through mismanagement and reckless risk-taking, you&#x27;re a hero? How the fuck does that make any sense? And why do we excuse people who do things that are actually unethical as if slimy behavior were the same thing as first-iteration roughness of a new product, when it&#x27;s clearly not?<p>The actual Silicon Valley is one where if you&#x27;re well-connected, you can fail all over the place in ways that actually hurt people, and that&#x27;s OK. If you&#x27;re perceived as an outsider (see: Ellen Pao) then even the slightest mistakes will give people cause to destroy your reputation. Let&#x27;s get rid of all this nonsense-- the clubby VCs, the slimy back-channeling-- and figure out a way to start fresh. I absolutely agree that the stigma on good-faith business failure out to go away. I&#x27;d love to see a world where small-business bank loans didn&#x27;t require personal liability (defeating the purpose of limited-liability protections) and  where mid-risk/mid-growth (&quot;lifestyle&quot;) businesses (instead of get-big-or-die gambits) could find funding. But there&#x27;s a classist, duplicitous edifice that we may have to take down first.",1427383211

server )<p>3. Has free client open source reference implementations for native use ( C or the like ) and some web language ( Python & Dynamic JS )<p>3b.

&quot;Social networks help to bond people who share similar interests all over the world. As a complement, the Facebook &quot;Like&quot; button is an efficient tool that bonds people with the online information. People click on the &quot;Like&quot; button to express their fondness of a particular piece of information and in turn tend to visit webpages with high &quot;Like&quot; count. The important fact of the Like count is that it reflects the number of actual users who &quot;liked&quot; this information. However, according to our study, one can easily exploit the defects of the &quot;Like&quot; button to counterfeit a high &quot;Like&quot; count. We provide a proof-of-concept implementation of these exploits, and manage to generate 100 fake Likes in 5 minutes with a single account. We also reveal existing counterfeiting techniques used by some online sellers to achieve unfair advantage for promoting their products. To address this fake Like problem, we study the varying patterns of Like count and propose an innovative fake Like detection method based on clustering. To evaluate the effectiveness of our algorithm, we collect the Like count history of more than 9,000 websites. Our experiments successfully uncover 16 suspicious fake Like buyers that show abnormal Like count increase patterns.&quot;<p><a href=""http://arxiv.org/abs/1503.05414"" rel=""nofollow"">http://arxiv.org/abs/1503.05414</a>",1427382111

9270088,comment,9269465,9269465,0,0,jkoudys,,,"The spaceship <=> is actually a lot cooler than many PHP devs realize. Rails devs find it extremely handy. Now that my PHP apps are moving away from being big apps that render full web-pages, and towards being a thin application layer that just renders JSON, I&#x27;m finding a higher % of my code is just sorting operations. Closure has helped a lot with this, and nearly all my <=>s are almost certainly going to be in the form of `function($a, $b) { return $a->getThingy() <=> $b->getThingy(); }`<p>Scalar type hints are a bit of a no-brainer. Type-hinting classes is nice, but there&#x27;s a lot of sloppiness out there because if you can&#x27;t type hint as a scalar, not only do you need a separate check to see if it&#x27;s int or string, you also specifically cannot say it&#x27;s non-object/array in your function declaration. One of the biggest inconsistencies I see, especially on old CMSes, is where you&#x27;d have a method in one class like `function doThing(Page $page) {`, and elsewhere as `function differentThing($page) {`, and sometimes differentThing&#x27;s $page is a Page, other times it&#x27;s an int with that page&#x27;s ID or name. Yes there are all kinds of ways to check for that today, but it benefits everyone if the easiest way to do something is also the right way.<p>Return type declaration has been in Hack for a while, and it&#x27;s really handy there. Any C or Java programmers know how useful they are. My big hope here is that they encourage others to stop returning mixed-types, which is a pattern that inevitably just puts more control logic around every call to that function. I don&#x27;t care too much about nullable type-hints on parameters (you can still set a default `= null` to allow nullable), but I&#x27;m _really_ hoping the nullable return-types passes. Having worked with this for a while in Hack, return types are far more useful if they&#x27;re nullable. e.g. you say `function isUserActive(): bool`, that&#x27;s totally fine since you&#x27;re clearly expecting it to be true or false, but if you had `function getActiveUser(): User`, you&#x27;d want the option to return null if there is no active user, which could be done nicely as `function getActiveUser(): ?User` if this passes: <a href=""https://wiki.php.net/rfc/nullable_types#return_types"" rel=""nofollow"">https://wiki.php.net/rfc/nullable_types#return_types</a><p>Now that we&#x27;re finally actually making a proper PHP spec, I&#x27;m not as excited about 4 and 5 as they&#x27;d like us to be. It&#x27;s definitely faster, but if the Zend engine isn&#x27;t the only game in town, it doesn&#x27;t matter as much. All the HHVM benchmarks I&#x27;ve seen still put it way above PHP7.",1427382093

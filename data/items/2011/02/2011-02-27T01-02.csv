2267074,comment,2266867,2266867,0,0,cletus,,,"Disclaimer: I work for Google. I <i>do not</i> work in search quality (or on search at all). Below are strictly my personal views.<p>I can't (and won't) comment on the specifics of this change. In fact, my knowledge of them is pretty much what everyone else's is.<p>What I will say is that in the last few months there have been several stories about the quality of Google search results in the last few months (eg scraper sites rating higher than the original).<p>The problem I see with such criticism as leveled with those episodes (and this one too) is that there is the implicit premise that Google's search results and algorithm are static. This most recent change should be evidence of that.<p>So while Google's search is algorithmic the people who are in charge of it are not. To put it another way: if you try and game Google's system, it will possibly work <i>for a time</i> but at some point, when the problem is viewed as being of sufficient severity to warrant attention, that algorithm will change.<p>Search, as I see it, is an arms race. SEO, particularly black hat SEO, is on the other side of that. But this isn't as simple as SEO. The world changes over time too. New business models form. New memes come into existence (eg the idea of social search).<p>So let's assume for a second the OP's argument is sound and that Google has merely killed off Demand Media's competition. If true, there are now a lot less content farms on highly ranked pages than there used to be. Sounds like a win to me. Is it a perfect solution? No. But is it better? Absolutely.<p>Google's mission is to deliver quality content to it's users. The more people use our properties, the more money we make. We are very focused on the user experience. Gaming our system is, at best, a short term proposition as there are an awful lot of bright and talented people here constantly striving to defeat such attempts.",1298771317
2267073,comment,2266632,2267050,0,0,Smerity,,,"The point is Redis is beginning to move away from being just an in-memory database. See my other comment for a more detailed answer as to the use case.<p>Persistent caches are an important commodity for many websites. For some services trying to handle standard traffic patterns with an empty cache is suicide and can cause cascading failures across the board. Without a strong persistence solution Redis can't be used here. antirez mentioned he considered it a strange move for Reddit to use to Cassandra and not Redis as a persistent cache[1] and I think the issues with Redis persistence may well have caused that.<p>Additionally I still think there's reasonable ground for a database that's primarily in-memory but drops least used data off to disk. The vast majority of the web follows a Zipfian/long tail distribution so although your ""working dataset"" can be far larger than RAM your actual ""active working dataset"" can fit in there. Why trade away the advantages of an in-memory data structure driven database when almost all your queries can be satisfied in this manner?<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/bcqhi/reddits_now_running_on_cassandra/c0m548l"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/bcqhi/reddits_n...</a>",1298771296

Granted I'm a Google services oriented person and Apple will most likely be releasing a new version of iOS for the iPad 2 in March, but apples to apples comparison: I've owned both now and I prefer Android.  Not for ""openness"", or because I don't like Apple, but because the functionality is just more intuitive and convenient.  Google really did good with Honeycomb.  Most specifically is the tabbed browsing (though apps like Google Reader still don't work correctly).<p>I realize there's no WiFi model at the moment to compete with the iPad's lower end choices but I would imagine that's coming.  Obviously there's a serious lack of apps for Android tablets as the Xoom is the first major tablet to be put out.  I think these problems will be solved in time and only be a concern to early adopters.<p>tldr; Android is serious competition for Apple and without some serious innovation they're at serious risk of falling behind.  I purposely purchased my Xoom so that the 14-day return window include the March 2nd iPad2 announcement, so I'm definitely not staying with the Xoom if Apple pulls a rabbit out of their hat.",1298770915
2267062,comment,2265960,2265960,0,0,alok-g,,,"I have had some thoughts on why mathematics is so fundamental to nature, but am not sure if these make any sense, or if they are ultimately cyclic.<p>I use words ""stuff"" and ""things"" to refer to not specifically matter but just any concept that may exist in the universe, maybe even just space or time.<p>1.  The universe may comprise stuff that does not interact with other stuff in any meaningful way.  (One issue here is that by merely talking about stuff, and more stuff, at least some aspects of set theory have already been assumed.  More on this below.)  (Such stuff would be unobservable to lifeforms within the universe so thinking about such stuff is meaningless for us.)<p>2.  I then invoke something like Plenitude principle to conclude that there are things in the universe that interact with each other.<p>3.  Interaction between any two things in the universe, is fundamentally same as transfer of some information between the two.  In other words, these two things appear different to us only because our language has two different ways of referring to this.<p>4.  Information is meaningless if it is completely random.  So there must be some pattern to it, or else #3 above is meaningless.  (In other words, it must be possible to describe the information transferred with less ""bits"" than the amount of ""bits"" transferred.  Or the Kolmogorov complexity must be less than the amount of information transferred.)  (While I use mathematical terms to convey the message, it is just because I need a language to say this.)<p>5.  Existence of any pattern whatsoever in information transferred leads to mathematics that we then define to describe the pattern.<p>Note that this model readily allows for:<p>A.  Laws of physics that are probabilistic in nature.  The information transfer must not be completely random, but this of course does not require it to be fully deterministic.<p>B.  Stuff that is unobservable or very weakly observable.  Dark matter, neutrinos, etc. would be examples of such stuff.<p>The biggest issue I know of that remains is assumption of at least some axioms of set theory, which also is a foundation of mathematics.<p>There could be universe(s) where there is either none or at most one of anything/everything.  Such a universe again would not have anything observable and is thus meaningless to us.  Again invoking Plenitude principle, I assume existence of a universe where there are more than one of something/anything.  But the moment one thinks of two things (say two particles, or even two values of a scalar variable like time or position), aspects of set theory or number theory have already come in.<p>On the other hand, and I believe for the same reason, mathematicians are unable to define what is meant by a set or a membership to a set.  (Everything I have read on set theory starts by assuming some meaning for these two terms and then follows with the rest.)<p>Would love to get feedback from others on if this makes sense, or if this is fundamentally wrong or cyclic.<p>Reason for edits:  Fixed some typos.",1298770898

2267046,comment,2266124,2266631,0,0,substack,,,"First, why wrap your second example in try {} catch {} but not the first?  The second example (final example from the article) seems like it was intentionally made more complicated to prove its point, but it could just be unfamiliarity. Node idioms are just <i>different</i> from other environments and it takes time to get a good feel for them.<p>(Edit: noticed that the article does it this way.)<p>How about just:<p><pre><code>    function insertCollection(collection, cb) {
        if (collection.length === 0) cb(null);
        else db.insert(collection[0], function (err) {
            if (err) cb(err)
            else insertCollection(collection.slice(1), cb)
        }
    }
</code></pre>
That's hardly much more complex, and as a bonus won't lock up your whole program while db.insert() is working. You could use something like my own library Seq() too:<p><pre><code>    var Seq = require('seq');
    function insertCollection (collection, cb) {
        Seq.ap(collection).seqEach(function () {
            db.insert(c, this);
        }).seq(cb).catch(cb)
    }</code></pre>
That is, if you actually want the inserts to go sequentially. Usually you want them to go in parallel with say a maximum of 10 pending requests:<p><pre><code>    var Seq = require('seq');
    function insertCollection (collection, cb) {
        Seq.ap(collection).parEach(10, function () {
            db.insert(c, this);
        }).seq(cb).catch(cb)
    }

Let's say for this case that N = 20.<p>This is a near perfect use case for Redis lists. I say near perfect as you still have the problem that if you have an incredibly active user (which we have many of) with thousands of log entries (of which they'd only ever likely be looking at the last few hundred) as you still need to keep that entire chunk in memory. It'd be great if you could archive past the last 1000 onto disk - you can do that with client side logic but it's still a bit of a pain and then you need to hope that Redis knows that those ""historical"" lists don't need to clog up the cache.<p>MySQL isn't up to the task in that case as if those entries aren't cached (which they likely aren't) then it needs to retrieve 20 rows from disk. Those rows on disk aren't sequential and with a single access on disk being 10ms that's 0.2 seconds per query or a total of 5 queries per second.

If the data was grouped or contiguous (as in the case of Redis Diskstore, BigTable style DBs etc) then you may be able to get upwards of 100 queries per second if a random read is 10 ms.<p>Even if we were using Redis or memcache in front of MySQL and requests came in only as we could handle them we'd only be able to serve ~430,000 requests per day. We have more users than that, the queries don't come in consistently (i.e. we still have to worry about peaks) and that's additionally not worrying about cache invalidation. Due to how slow this is it'd be nice to take snapshots to make Redis a persistent cache but then you hit the same initial problems I mentioned before.<p>The issue with using Redis as the primary datastore is related to the persistence issues I mentioned previously. Saves can end up taking a long time and chew up a lot more memory than I'm comfortable with. This is complicated by the fact that it'd be preferable to have some chunk of the cold dataset stored on disk but the Virtual Memory persistence option is not really suited and additionally makes saves even worse (as now you're reading from a slow disk IO device [the VM files] to save to a different slow disk IO device [the database backup] whilst trying to serve the occasional cold query from the VM).<p>Diskstore would solve the problems of persistent storage and slow disk IO (as the SAVE wouldn't thrash the VM disk whilst Redis was trying to use the VM disk to serve cold queries) but unfortunately we can't wait for it. I truly am looking forward to it being released however and will look to it for other future projects =]",1298769783

2267031,comment,2266788,2266788,0,0,fleitz,,,"Have to agree on this one. My startup is in the same space, we're taking a totally different approach. The focus is on creating a compelling presentation / pitch. When you use the product it feels like your interacting with the company.<p>We're pretty much iPad exclusive as we think the best way to approach the space is to put pitching tools in the hands of the entrepreneur. The idea is that investors and entrepreneurs will share the presentation physically by passing the iPad around. We also have tools to gather information on the spot, if the person wants to look it over later, take their email in the app and it emails them a link to the presentation. Which they can review later.<p>Use Cases:<p>In person amongst friends:
Check out this startup, and then pass the iPad to the person. We see this use case more for someone who has been presented to in person and is sharing with others who may also be interested.<p>Elevator Pitch:
If you get the opportunity for an elevator pitch and generate interest you can pass them a compelling presentation. The buttons are also oversized so that while you're presenting you can still guide the presentation while it's held in the other person's hand.<p>Multiple People:
With your iPad in hand you'll always be prepared to present, if you find yourself in a board room, or anywhere with a TV simply plug the VGA/TV connector in and display the presentation on the big screen.<p>The exit / next round:
It's easy for investors to take their portfolio companies presentation and add them to their home screen, that way when they are looking for prospective buyers for the next round / exit they have those great presentations on hand and can easily walk the buyer through.<p>We'll eventually support recording a presentation so that the app flips through the various parts of the presentation automatically while playing your recorded audio as the app transitions through the pitch.<p>We have no social media integration other than to login/share with friends, we don't think it's a good idea to encourage a herd mentality and that prospective investors should make up their own mind, rather than relying on the herd for signals. I think over the long term it will build a better understanding between investor and entrepreneur. Rather than investing based on what is in vogue.<p>We focus on creating a compelling story for the entrepreneur by being rich in imagery, video, and eventually audio. We're helping entrepreneurs create a connection and generate real interest in what sets their company apart from the herd.<p>Once we have the presentation down and have that working flawlessly we'll move to social media.",1298769375

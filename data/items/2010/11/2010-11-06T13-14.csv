They're just too expensive.<p>It seemed to me the comparison in the article was more toward something like an ARM-based platform. In my opinion a large part of the success is the combination of price (compared to $100+ microcontroller development boards) and accessiblity (a mostly out-of-box tool chain and set of libraries).<p>> The microcontroller that the Arduino uses costs a few dollars, which is a tiny fraction of $30 for the whole board.<p>Keep in mind that part of the cost of the board is ""sustainable development"" due to it being produced in Italy with apparently known labour practices.",1289051966

Meaning that lost manufacturing jobs are not necessarily a bad thing, but rather a natural procession to more advanced division of labor. Indeed, the focus on ""keeping jobs"" at all costs may be harming development.<p>But we could also say robots are a means to evade the uncompetitive nature of the labor market. By adding restrictions, politicians are forcing businesses to shift their manufacturing to automatic processes rather than human laborers. So we have lower skilled people prevented from working (and sometimes from ever gaining employment), expensive high-skilled technicians and engineers and expensive technology. The free market will route against barriers, often with unintended consequences. For now at least, Chinese laborers are a better alternative to autonomous robots.",1289051409

That's unless you already have a bunch of developer friends willing/wanting to be apart & turn  your idea in a reality.<p>There are so many posts here and experiences (my own) where someone is looking to create an idea but they do not have the friends or the ooomph to convince others to join him/her to build their idea or start-up.  If you fall into such category go out and learn html, css & photoshop and hire a developer.  It will take you longer but you'll gain a skill, have better control of your vision and most important your idea will become a reality.",1289048938

It ignores a fundamental biological difference twixt men and women; that in general, men are bigger and significantly stronger (I won't look up the exact numbers, but a much larger proportion of a man's body is muscle).<p>Here's a more accurate analogy that carries with it the psychological overtones your analogy missed.<p>Imagine you are a man, at some party, and some big guy approaches. He's way bigger than you, maybe as much as a foot taller, and he's clearly much stronger. Even if he's not sporting his muscles visibly, it's clear. He's bigger than you, stronger than you, and ultimately if he wanted to force you to do something, the advantage would definitely be with him. He looks an you in such a way that it's clear he wants to have sex with you, and then forces a kiss upon you, and then rams his hands into your underwear.<p>You can struggle, but he's bigger and stronger and really your only option is to push free and go somewhere with other people who will protect you if he tries it again.<p>You'll be thinking about this for days, wondering what would have happened if there was nobody there to protect you. You'll probably feel weak and vulnerable and violated. You'll think of this every time you go to a party for the next year. Every party you go to that you should be able to enjoy, you'll be thinking about this; afraid that someone bigger and stronger might decide to sexually assault you. It's a fucking horrible way to live.",1289048731

It's just if the regulator of your industry requires that the code be developed and deployed by different people. If not, it's normal for the two camps to have significant overlap.",1289048678

1876794,comment,1876657,1876719,0,0,saurik,,,"I agree: the site accomplished its only stated goal. As someone who was approached by usesthis to be on their site (just last week: I have not said ""no"" yet) I can say that the guy who runs it specifically seems to have not cared much about how to optimize for generating insight into the /why/ behind what people are using.<p>Personally, however, I found that quite disappointing. :( Reading through the list of people and what they had to say I'm thinking, ""man, I wonder if that was a random choice, or something that person spent a lot of time thinking about"". Maybe I'm weird, but just knowing that someone who's work I admire has a Compaq Concerto isn't interesting if I don't understand the tradeoffs that went into its purchase.<p>Another complaint I have is that the site attempts what I believe to be a strong and artificial separation between hardware and software, and even requires a fixed ordering: hardware first, software second.<p>In my experience, software and hardware are really two different physical manifestations of the same underlying concepts (maybe I've spent way too much time on projects that involved writing software to accomplish the same goal as a previous generation's fixed function hardware), and end up having dependency relationships that criss-cross the supposed boundary.<p>As an example, many people interviewed on the site mentioned that they own a MacBook only because they were recently doing a lot of iPhone development and needed to use Apple's iOS SDK. However, it led to awkward phrasing to do that in the hardware section (before they had a chance to go more in depth into the software later), so the comment is stilted at the top and then short changed later (as it was already mentioned earlier).<p>It is also quite common, however, for people to first look at physical device properties like form factor, screen size, or input subsystem, leading them to make decisions that sound like ""once I decided I had to have a netbook, I started evaluating whether to run Debian or Windows 7: either would be fine as I really only needed to run Chrome and a terminal"".<p>I therefore look at this website as a giant list of missed opportunities to learn something really interesting and important about a number of really awesome people, and while I again agree: the site accomplished its stated goal, I think it is appropriate to judge a site on whether the underlying concept was appropriate in addition to whether they succeeded at their implementation.",1289048496

But Martin hadn't really done much wrong. The book was free online, and it would be classed as fair use by many people if it had been made using music, film or tv. He also made sure to credit Zed for the text, and only an idiot would think that Zed was able to change his text to fit the code better so I don't think it would reflect back on Zed badly at all...<p>Then again, in my opinion, what is important is that there are more beginning code examples to read in Ruby.

As long as you don't rip off people's images, exact color schemes, etc., the underlying code tends to be pretty generic and fairly immune from any sort of copyright prosecution. And who would want a website that looks a lot like someone else's?<p>Can you tell me about a use case or two you imagine? Who buys someone else's templates? What sort of person or business? What do they do with the template afterwards... do they change it, or do you imagine the web will be like Blogger where 4 templates rule millions of sites?<p>I imagine that it will be hard to make this market, when people already expect to get this for free.

If not, would you sell previous designs? If so how much?

They were quagmired with the System 9 line - they could have kept incrementing, but it was obvious they'd hit some limits.<p>I think one thing people forget is how bad OS X was when it first came out. It was slow, missing key features, and was just plain buggy. It wasn't really until Tiger that they had something ready for the mainstream (imho).<p>But they took some risks - especially with the rendering approach w/ Aqua - and as hardware caught up it started to pay off. The features they can slip in today are really the result of some brave design decisions a decade ago (the Intel transition is another example).<p>It was somewhat easier then because Apple's market was still a very hardcore group. Now, it might be harder for them to go through such a revolution - the market might just rebel against them... The downside to brand I guess.<p>Of course, Apple made a good move with the iPhone - this is a totally different evolutionary path that might be a better bet (i.e. Perhaps there won't be an OS 11, or if there is by the time it comes it might not be as big a deal as other things).",1236991248

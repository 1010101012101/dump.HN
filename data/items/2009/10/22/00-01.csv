895983,comment,895979,895979,0,0,jamie,,,"This is tremendous advice:<p>""Jeff makes an insightful point that, when designing for scale, you should design for expected load, ensure it still works at x10, but don't worry about scaling to x100. The problem here is that x100 scale usually calls for a different and usually more complicated solution than what you would implement for x1; a x100 solution can be unnecessary, wasteful, slower to implement, and have worse performance at a x1 load. I would add that you learn a lot about where the bottlenecks will be at x100 scale when you are running at x10 scale, so it often is better to start simpler, learn, then redesign rather than jumping into a more complicated solution that might be a poor match for the actual load patterns.""",1256172333

Yet who worth his salt will remain at such companies if the compensation needed to keep them competitive with otherwise similarly situated companies is not there - or, worse, was there but was cut by a ""pay czar' for who knows what reasons (especially bad if people have their pay cut in order to appease popular prejudices)?<p>Yet what ""pay czar"" worth his salt will <i>not</i> want to scrutinize all salaries closely for companies that have been feasting at the public trough? Of course, that is his job and he must do it to be responsible.<p>Sometimes such cuts will be more than warranted; other times, they will be arbitrary. There really is no good measure for determining which is which. Hence, it can all become political or not and only the bureaucrats and politicians will ever know - of course, those directly affected will also know and they will not likely stick around for more if they are indeed working hard only to have political factors wind up hurting them economically with no recourse but to have to suck it up.<p>And so the whole system is calculated to do anything <i>but</i> help the companies turn around, at least as this might happen through having competitively paid and motivated individuals in positions of ultimate responsibility.<p>I do not say this out of sympathy for the corporations. Most of them richly deserve all that they are getting right now. But the poor taxpayer is not well-served either, as a losing approach goes from bad to worse in all likelihood, with the taxpayer perpetually on the hook for more.",1256170024

To put it simply, we humans have trouble thinking from a different perspective, and we tend to focus on what we'd lose rather than gain.  Thus, people who own their own business would be biased towards thinking that running their own business is the better option.<p>Yeah, I've been reading Predictably Irrational.",1256170015

Some people would disagree, but those tend to be Apple haters who irrationally believe that Apple's success consists solely of pulling the wool over people's eyes with clever marketing.  Gruber on the other hand, repeatedly sets the record straight on Apple in a way that would be quite informative to analysts if they paid attention.<p>I have to admit though it's fun to watch analysts' perennial struggle to understand what makes a user-experience driven company work.  Even after Apple almost kicked the bucket following all that analyst advice in the 90s, there is always this contingent that somehow thinks Apple should be Dell + Microsoft.",1256169850

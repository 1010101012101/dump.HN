3623989,comment,3623607,3623889,2,0,jacques_chester,,,"Banks borrow from overseas markets. The largest such market by a wide margin is the USA. Cheap US dollars make their way around the world, variously driving up currencies and driving down interest rates offered by banks.<p>Here in Australia, there's been a great deal of consternation that the ""Big 4"" banks no longer closely follow the movements in the cash rate set by the Reserve Bank (our central bank). This is because central bank funds have fallen to less than half of the cost of funding for our banks -- they mostly get their cash from the US and relend it Australians.<p>When the crisis first broke, Australian bank rates rose even while central bank rates fell. And that's because international finance became much more expensive.",1329976650

(I've even set up my system to use Ryan Bates's Railscast theme to keep things looking familiar.) Unlike TextMate, Sublime Text supports multiple panes and is cross-platform.<p>Because of its advantages (being cross-platform is the clincher), I'm planning to use Sublime Text in place of TextMate in the 2nd edition of the Rails Tutorial screencasts. I also hope to make a Sublime-specific screencast at some point, with an emphasis on keyboard shortcuts useful for Rails development. Further updates as events warrant.",1329976490

Their product did not deliver anything for years but with the massive amount of cash they have, it was bound to get somewhere eventually. Today it's way beyond where it was when they were just delivering lessons over Adobe Connect a few years ago. The problem is that the entire time they've been talking the same talk. So it's hard to gauge at this point how good of a system they really have because when it was non-existant they talked about it the same way they talk about it now, $50 million in funding later. I do wish them luck and applaud them for having a big vision but it's hard to tell if the smoke and mirrors were ever replaced with anything meaningful.",1329976344

When producers mastered for CD, you got the best quality that they could produce or that the CD could hold. (Whichever came first.) Now that the CD is fading into irrelevance, theres the worry that digital distribution will make the average quality of a track <i>worse</i> instead of what it should be, better than CD. (Though at this point I'd take parity with CD quality.) Yeah, I get it, lossless tracks take up a lot of memory. They should still be an <i>option</i> to purchase though. Lossless is the default state for recordings anyway.<p>I don't even have the equipment required to hear the difference.

Probably a <i>lot</i> more than the cost of making a Wireshark plugin and having sysadmins install it as necessary.<p>Edit: put another way, I think designers should prioritise the needs of the people who pay the cost of network operation over the convenience of the operators.<p>There's a feedback loop here -- if it's <i>too</i> hard and thus very expensive to operate a system, then optimising for performance was a false win.

Since I clearly remember Apple IIs and TRS-80s, I still get a bit of a ""wow I'm in the future!"" thrill whenever I fire up a modern computer or mobile device.<p>Being a bit older helps me recall the amazingness of the modern world.<p>Several commenters have pointed out that levelling up means cutting off choices - but I managed to mostly follow what I enjoyed when I was younger, and I would much rather be a capable developer than an olympic athlete or a rock star. I MAKE THINGS. THAT CHANGE PEOPLE'S LIVES. EVERY DAY. Most 'successful' people my age can't say that, if they ever could. Middle management doesn't MAKE anything, unless you count meetings and memos - but I do.<p>Random advice for younger folks: making at least some kind of a living doing what you love and making a difference is way better than making big money doing something pointless that you hate.<p>Part of me still thinks that I'm 25, but another part of me is now old enough to reflect on the clueless jerk I occasionally was when I was 25. Growing up is a balance between who you were and who you are now, and especially in technology it's important to not forget your 25-year-old self while still keeping the 40-year-old as well. If you can be both 20-something and 40-something at the same time, it makes for a great combination of enthusiasm and perspective.",1329974486

Now, the New Hampshire House of Representatives is voting tomorrow (February 23, 2012) on H.B. 1700, which would repeal money transmission laws in New Hampshire. If you or someone you know works for a payments-related startup, this is something you should definitely support.<p>From our friends in New Hampshire:<p>""The Republicans (except for Sullivan, who is owned by large banking interests) are more likely to be favorable to this. Our best allies are Hunt (the committee chairman) and McGuinness. They could use some encouragement. Other people who should be contacted are Flanders, Headd, Nevins and Sullivan, who needs to hear from our side more.<p>Some talking points:<p>1. Merchants are getting killed by high credit card processing rates, and piecemeal state regulation and licensing prohibits real competition in the payments market.<p>2. Consumers pay more for goods and services because of the lack of competition in the payments market.<p>3. Licensing in New Hampshire is keeping computer firms out that would otherwise consider locating here. The ""New Hampshire advantage"" is meaningless to the up-and-coming internet payments companies can start up and grow in nearby Massachusetts, which does not license money transmitters.<p>4. Consumer protection is almost non-existent because the licensing fees are collected by the State Banking Commission, an agency which is required to be self-financing. The $52,475 collected in fees each year cover little more than the cost of licensing and records keeping. There have been almost no enforcement actions against money transmitters in recent years, except to collect the licensing fee.<p>5. Money laundering by money transmitters is already covered -- and prosecuted -- under Federal Law, specifically 31 USC 5321 (the Bank Secrecy Act) and its associated regulations 31 CFR 103.57, as well as 18 USC 1956 (Laundering of Monetary Instruments).<p>Here's the list of representatives on the committee:<p>Ronald Belanger <ron.belanger@leg.state.nh.us> (R-Salem)<p>Jerry Bergevin <jbergevin@myfairpoint.net> (R-Manchester)<p>Jennifer Coffey <jenn.coffey@leg.state.nh.us> (R-Andover)<p>Donald Flanders <dflanders@metrocast.net> (R-Laconia)<p>James Headd <jimheadd@comcast.net> (R-Auburn)<p>John Hunt <jbhunt@prodigy.net> (R-Rindge)<p>Donna Mauro <donnamauro@donnamauro.com> (R-Windham)<p>Sean McGuinness <sean.mcguinness@leg.state.nh.us> (R-Nashua)<p>Chris Nevins <vnav46@comcast.net> (R-Hampton)<p>David Palfrey <weblakes@metrocast.net> (R-Franklin)<p>Frederick Rice <fred.rice@leg.state.nh.us> (R-Hampton)<p>James Sullivan <james.sullivan@leg.state.nh.us> (R-Deerfield)""",1329974221

3623894,comment,3623475,3623718,14,0,klodolph,,,"You have the right idea, but the wrong numbers.  Terribly, terribly wrong numbers, it's quite clear you're making those numbers up.  No filter for an audio ADC would ever have a cutoff as low as 2.2 kHz, not even if it were for a telephone.  (You have a strong signal theory background?  No offense, but really?)<p>When you use a 44.1 kHz sampling frequency, any frequency above 22.05 kHz will be ""aliased"" and recorded as a lower frequency.  This sounds <i>incredibly nasty,</i> like the sounds you'd get out of a broken Commodore 64.  So you have to remove frequencies above 22.05 kHz in order to get a clean recording.  But human ears can hear up to 20 kHz or so depending on age (e.g., NTSC TVs with cathode ray tubes have a 15 kHz horizontal refresh which drives me nuts, but my parents can't hear it at all).<p>The trick then, is to design a filter that will let the 20 Hz - 20 kHz band through while stopping everything above 22.05 kHz.  We call 20 Hz-20 kHz the ""pass band"" and 22.05 kHz and above the ""stop band"".  We don't really care what happens to the frequencies between the pass band and the stop band: the range from 20 kHz to 22.05 kHz which can't be heard well enough to be worth preserving and doesn't cause aliasing so it doesn't need cutting out.  This is difficult because the stop band is only 1.1x the frequency of the pass band -- for you musicians out there, that's less than the difference between C and D on the western scale.  (Just think for a minute: design a filter that lets middle C through, but completely filters out the D above.)<p>Heavens no you wouldn't use a Butterworth filter for such a task.  We want an elliptic filter, probably.  3rd order is no good either, it won't give a sharp enough cutoff.  8th order is better.  This will get you a cutoff around 20 kHz with something like 60 dB attenuation at 22.05 kHz.  People need a lot of these filters, so you can actually go out and buy a 20 kHz low-pass 8th order elliptic filter as a monolithic chip.<p>Let's suppose you chose a 48 kHz sampling rate instead.  Now the stopband starts at 24 kHz instead of 22.05 kHz.  It sounds like a small difference (22.05->24 kHz cutoff) but it's actually a factor of 2 (2.05->4 kHz transition band).  This means that with the same components, you can get 80 dB or more attenuation in the stop band.<p>Now go to 96 kHz.  You have to design a filter that rolls off between 20 kHz and 48 kHz.  That's <i>easy peasy,</i> and you can reduce the ripple, increase the attenuation, maybe reduce the order (affecting noise) and make all sorts of design tradeoffs that are much easier.<p>Now think about 192 kHz.  What's the point?  What does 192 kHz get you that 96 kHz doesn't have?  It's already easy enough to design a very nice system at 96 kHz.  I think 192 kHz is a bunch of bunk as far as audio is concerned.<p>That's recording.  Now let's talk about playback.<p>Playback is very similar, everything goes in the opposite direction.  You start with a digital signal, convert it to analogue, and put it through a low-pass filter.  The aliasing noise is still there, except instead of reflecting high frequencies to low ones, it reflects low frequencies to high ones.  So you get the same trade-offs.<p>The difference is that playback requirements are not as difficult as recording requirements.  In particular, the required SNR of a playback system is lower than that of a recording system.  I think 48 kHz is fine for playback.<p>The problem is these stupid 192 kHz systems have backers with big names who never bothered to do proper double-blind tests to figure out if the difference is actually perceptible.  You can even get a 384 kHz system these days, which would be overengineered for dogs and is more than good enough for bats.",1329974117

One of the core modelling assumptions was that house prices could never decline across the USA as a whole.  Everyone in the food chain was happy to let the rating agencies use this idea as a foundational assumption in the modelling of RMBS - because everyone creating new structures (and providing enormous numbers of mortgages) made money as long as the game didn't stop.<p>Also at fault were the regulators, who entrusted the Rating Agencies with determining the leverage in the financial system, by using their ratings ('AAA', 'AA', 'BBB', etc) as the basis on which bank's capital was used.  Simply achieving a AAA rating (which was always possible : the Rating Agencies published their models, leading quants at investment banks to optimize against them) meant that banks could buy enormous quantities of the assets (since they were basically risk-free for capital purposes).

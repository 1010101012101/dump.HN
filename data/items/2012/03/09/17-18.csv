3685162,comment,3683202,3683202,8,0,angersock,,,"I consider myself pro-piracy and anti-copyright. Yet, this article still hits a nerve.<p>First off, and perhaps most unforgivably, the author makes no distinction between content creators and content distributors. All of their arguments seem to be based around creators charging too much--that isn't so! It's the distributors that saddle us with DRM, shitty prices, and ads.<p>A great example of this is the line:<p><pre><code>  ""The artists who wake up and realize they can sell me\n  their newest physical CD for $20.""\n</code></pre>\nThat's usually not the artist, unless you buy the album at a show or something! That's Sony! That's BMG! It's those bastards, not the artist!<p>This misdirected anger does not help their case.<p>Second, there is far too much of an entitled tone. Statements like<p><pre><code>  ""You can offer me a pdf file or simply link me to a \n  webpage, but stop ignoring this valuable info. And make \n  sure you have a website that details everything you've  \n  released and what you're working on. There's nothing more \n  frustrating than finding a new obscure artist you like \n  who only has a dormant Myspace music page.There's nothing \n  more frustrating than finding a new obscure artist you \n  like who only has a dormant Myspace music page.""\n</code></pre>\nand<p><pre><code>  ""At the very least, I should get a discount on your older \n  stuff for being a current customer.""\n</code></pre>\nThese do not read well, to put it mildly. When the Man comes around to point out those damn freeloading kids it is exactly these sorts of quotes he points to. Wah wah wah I want a pdf and a web page and a pony--yes, these are all sound business and advertising moves, but asking for it this way is unpalatable.<p>There is a third issue with the stance taken by the author. Observe:<p><pre><code>  ""I heard from a friend that Mafia was an enjoyable game. \n  I downloaded it, played it and enjoyed it. Did I \n  immediately go rush out and buy it? No, of course not. \n  But when I heard Mafia II was coming out and it was made \n  by the same company as the first one, I pre-ordered it.""\n</code></pre>\nIn theory, in a world where developers can make multiple titles, this is a not-entirely-invalid approach. Let the devs prove themselves, then reward them with your future patronage.<p>The problem--and perhaps the author isn't familiar enough with the industry enough to know this--is that publishers, who are the ones hurt by piracy, are the ones who nowadays make-or-break most studios. When you don't buy the first game, the publisher doesn't see a sale, and so is likely to shutter the studio and give the IP to somebody else.<p>It's not merely enough to buy the <i>next</i> game--you must also fund the developer so that there <i>can be</i> a next game!<p>(As an aside, it would seem that maybe this is why piracy seems not to affect indies so much...a lot of them take donations or have pay-as-dev-happens models. It's when studios are held under the power of a publisher that these alternate funding mechanisms seem to fail, and thus studios can't survive to make a reputation when their first game is pirated.)<p>There's some other good stuff in there, but those are three things the author really needs to get straight in their argument.",1331315956

His stated reasons for staying there rather than taking offered positions at google etc is that he can work on exactly what he wants and bill it out to the school.<p>I get what you are saying about VC's expecting people to act like they are intending to create businesses.  I think someone smart will be able to see the difference here between something like what he wants to do and what something like facebook or kickstarter is doing.  He is pushing the edge of knowledge and literally couldn't do it without the tools that he has gained in research.  I honestly believe if someone talked to him they would see everything he has done for the last 10 years has been with this type of thinking in mind.<p>The social proof would not be a problem, top professors in compsci and mathematics know him; and he has code to back up his claims.<p>750k includes 70k a year for he and another engineer.

3685158,comment,3684624,3684624,1,0,ChuckMcM,,,"The title is link-baitey of course, but the general thesis is this:<p><pre><code>  * control over essential components.\n  * market leadership in applications.\n  * continual innovation.\n</code></pre>\nThe first one is the way in which Apple dominates and controls the supply chain. It's not monopolistic since they are paying real money for goods from third parties, but one has to wonder if there is restrictions on starting up new production lines. This becomes a huge barrier to entry to anyone else. I'm really curious to know where ASUS is getting their 1920x1200 glass for the new Transformer Prime. Like nuclear proliferation, there are a few key components that can prevent others effectively from building tablets.  These are currently displays and radios.<p>The application one has been discussed a lot on HN, but basically what it boils down to is Apple's policies with regards to applications acceptable for publication creates a more homogenous user experience. There is anecdotal evidence that this translates into a user perception of 'quality' to those applications.<p>And finally they don't stop, like Intel's tick-tock sort of model they move incrementally forward each release. You can argue that the 'new iPad' is what the iPad 2 should have been but missed out, or you can argue its the same old same old with just a higher res screen and 4G, but the release after release means that if you're an Asus or a Samsung or a Dell, Etc and your development cycle is 2 years you have to guess where they will be in 2 years if you want to compete head to head. That is harder than you might think until you've tried it a few times. And of course the risk is that the 'new' thing might have come out of left field so its high risk.<p>A strategy which has more understood risk is to create your own product in the space which has your own vision of what it will be, but folks like RIM who have tried that have been challenged to think outside the space that they were successful in. Apple's advantage here was that the iPad is in many ways just a big iPod touch. And they had a lot of information about the touch which could help them vet various ideas.",1331315912

If I could create todo's and categorize them GTD style I might return to iOS.<p>- Floating Tasks (where they carry over) to me would be an instant sell.  It's an absolute must and few people even know about it. I'd buy it on the spot if there was there.<p>- My work flow is - create todo's in general, and then the floating todo's get scheduled on a day.  Each day, I then assign a time to them (drag them) and I have my schedule for the day.  My job is just to create the todo's as they come up, or enter the hard appointments.  In the end, todo's become calendar items.<p>- Allow syncing via wifi to your computer instead of just through icloud or google sync.  All three would appeal to everyone<p>- If you want to connect off line feel free, I have obsessed over the perfect calendar/todo system for about 6 years trying to replicate the productivity nirvana I had on Palm OS with DateBK6.  DateBK6 was the one app made me use the Treo years after it was outdated and it was by far the smartest and most productive app I've ever used in my life. All my efforts through Windows Mobile, iOS and now Android have been to replicate <i>that</i> experience.<p>Pimlical is becoming more intuitive by the day, it's highly gestured workflow is sinking it's teeth into me.  I might not be fond of Gingerbread but the tractorbeam of a working calendar/todo is too strong.  The app was built by the same company that has built the best calendar/todo I've ever used, DateBK6.<p>About the site:<p>- The video was great.  The music selection helped express the magicalness of how light and easy it is.<p>- It might be worthwhile having an interactive demo where people can drag things themselves.  Might be a moot point in the beginning but a lack of buttons can be intimidating.  Not for me though.<p>Good luck.<p>What I like about yours is natively tying in the power of gestures.

It will (and already is) cannibalizing a lot of PC usage and sales.<p>Three questions/comments:<p>1) Why do you feel it is bigger than the phone market? I'm skeptical of this, at least until the day tablets and laptops merge (imagine a tablet that docks into a keyboard/touchpad).  Almost everyone needs a phone these days. And if you could only have one, I imagine most would take the laptop/desktop over the tablet.<p>2) How much evidence is there for large-scale cannibalization? I always figured the iPad is growing so much faster than PCs, because the PC market is saturated and frequent upgrades are no longer necessary.  Everyone has a computer already and a 4+ year old one works fine.  Tablets are new and desirable - but is there that much evidence yet that a tablet is actually more desirable than a computer?<p>3) Strongly disagree that apps are more important on a tablet than a phone.  Phones are lower power typically and screen space is at a premium, so I'd argue that native apps are more important on a phone. Tablets should be able to handle webapps fine.",1331315188

The whole reason that Apple is so successful is they build the device that just works for most people out there.  Most people just don't care about the 41MP camera, the projector, etc...<p>Most of my circle of close friends are not geeks and Android frustrates them, it confuses them....and none of them, not a single one have even asked me about an Android based tablet other than the Fire and that doesn't even really count.  Most of these friends are the ones that Samsung and other higher end Android devices would love to have as customers...highly educated with high disposable income.  And they don't even consider their devices.<p>Variety is over valued in the geek community and just doesn't drive real profits in most cases and I believe this is one of them.  Each of those unique phones has a lower profit ratio and drives a race to the bottom in quality because of it.  None of them will drive enough sales to have a decent profit margin due to additional engineering, marketing, and support costs due to the different models.<p>Now, to be sure, Android isn't going away and eventually someone will find a way to make a dent in the iPad's market share but I just think the tablet market is very very different from the smart phone market.  Everyone pretty much has a mobile phone and when you can get a smartphone for free you take it...but the tablet market is more discretionary and there and I just don't see people going away from iPad.

IMHO the iPad will dominate the tablet market for <i>at least the next 3 years</i>.<p>People like analogies. Two regular comparisons on HN and elsewhere are Windows vs Mac and iPhone vs Android (interestingly the second is also used as an analogy for the first).<p>All of these analogies are wrong.<p>A smartphone has very high (what I call) <i>built-in utility</i>. You can use it to make and receive calls, send and receive SMSs/emails, take photos, get directions and browse the Web. At a guess, this accounts for probably 70% of smartphone usage. A large portion of the rest would be (again, I'm guessing here) games.<p>Android is a commoditizing product. With the standard Google apps, you get 70% of the utility (based on my earlier assumptions) of an iPhone. The point here is the ecosystem doesn't matter as much.<p>The iPad is a different beast entirely and (as I've been saying for 1.5+ years now) IMHO much more important and will be a much bigger market than the phone market. It will (and already is) cannibalizing a lot of PC usage and sales.<p>The thing to note about the iPad is that 70% figure is (at least anecodtally) vastly different. The ecosystem matters. Apps and content matter much more than on phones. And this is where the iPad competitors really suffer and will continue to suffer.<p>It's why I have the most hope for Amazon in the iPad competitor space because they have the closest thing to what the iTunes ecosystem can provide. Without this, despite the relatively low price, I don't think the Kindle Fire would've sold anywhere near the number of units than it did.<p>A better analogy for the iPad than the iPhone is actually the iPod. 10+ years after the iPod's release it still accounts for the majority of MP3 player sales. Yes you can rip your own CDs and buy your MP3s from Amazon and elsewhere but the convenience of the ecosystem trumps pretty much everything else. Last year it was rumoured that Apple would kill the Classic until it was pointed out that the Classic is the fifth biggest selling MP3 player (the top 4 are all Apple too).<p>Apple's supply chain management, innovative financing and unprecedented warchest certainly have given it a massive advantage, no question. No one else can (yet) create a product at similar specs for a similar price. But it's the ecosystem that has driven and will continue to drive the iPad's dominance.",1331313547

3684864,comment,3675047,3678780,1,0,Skywing,,,"I would use basically the same set of tools, today.<p>I used IDA to annotate the dis-assembly of various files that I was interested in. I never did like IDA's run-time debugging  interface. So, I used OllyDbg for most of my debugging. I liked OllyDbg because of the graphical nature of it all. But, I would also use WinDbg if I wanted to set breakpoints on unresolved symbols. I couldn't seem to get OllyDbg to do that. WinDbg is great if you're familiar with the more command-line approach.<p>I used Ethereal, now named Wireshark, for packet capture and inspection. You just have to get familiar with the filters to harness the power of it. I'd typically start by using netstat to see what ports were being used, and then I'd filter on those ports. A lot of my first protocol reverse engineering was really just pure brute force by staring at packet dumps of multiple log in attempts with all the cases (success, fail, etc) and just basically doing a manual diff process, noting the changes. Until I got better at using IDA and WinDbg, anyways.<p>For quick and dirty virtual mem scanning, I'd just use this tool called ArtMoney. It was an amazing tool because you could scan the memory for some data, bookmark offsets and then re-scan. Basically, you could build upon previous scans, allowing you to sieve results. Like, in StarCraft this was so easy because if you were trying to find a value that was increasing or decreasing, like supply income, you scan and scan again saying ""show me only the results that went down since last scan."" Then, scan again using those results but only show the ones that went up. Usually, after 3-4 sieve scans you'd be staring at your values. Then you just attach OllyDbg to the process, breakpoint on memory read or write to them, see where it breaks and step out a few function calls (because you'd usually land in some low level write function or loop event or something).<p>Lots of tools, but the key is just to use common sense. Think about what it's logically doing. Use your knowledge of game loops and stuff to determine what you're probably looking at or looking for. Always annotate the assembly code, even if at first it seems small and stupid. Over time those small notes add up and you'll end up with fully commented code. :P A lot can be researched by poking around in the files in the install directories, too.",1331312669

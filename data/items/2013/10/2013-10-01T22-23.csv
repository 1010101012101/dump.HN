The problem is that there are many things you can do to slow down the flow rate even further, and merging poorly creates this &quot;turbulence&quot; which wastes further flow.<p>And, it&#x27;s clear that no improvement in merging behavior can beat the maximum road occupancy, however we can approach that limit much more closely.<p>I think that conceptually modelling traffic as fluid flows is quite clever, and the &quot;turbulence&quot; idea is particularly satisfying.",1380668274

In terms of intrinsic language properties, its hard to be both really expressive <i>and</i> a good language for learning.

Now given that there will be little difference in overall throughput would you rather a) have a relaxing smooth drive or b) a stressful highly variant aggressive drive? The answer should be a, because the increased of risk of a fatal crash vs. the miniscule return of a few car lengths is not worth the effort you put in.<p>You can verify this yourself. Drive as smooth as possible. Smoothly accelerate and decelerate. Leave large gaps. Try to use both your accelerator and brakes as little as possible. Now observe aggressive drivers and memorize their car&#x27;s make, model and license plate. Observe the amount of risk and effort they undertake to get ahead. Then observe them only getting about 5-10 car lengths for their trouble. Finally observe them stopped behind you two traffic lights down.<p>Laminar flow = turbulent flow, but laminar is so much better.<p>This is besides the fact that laminar flow reduces traffic waves, reducing the variance for all those behind you, leading to a reduced risk of death and injury for everyone in your lane.

You can definitely see an older MS smartphone and still see it as being a smartphone.<p>2) The BB model - optimize for most common use-cases and provide a dedicated set of physical inputs to operate. These days, feature phones pretty much do everything a BB can do, but the interface into the capabilities suck. The classic BB phone is very much a feature phone on steroids. A nicer screen, better input but good hardware build quality and excellent email services. It turns out that turing machines are turing machines and BB eventually figured out you can run other kinds of apps on the devices, but their pedigree is very much an amped up feature phone.<p>3) The iPhone model. Grids and capacitive touchscreens. Let&#x27;s be honest here, Android started as a copy of the BB model, early Android phones even had a similar set of input mechanisms.<p>The iPhone model is interesting in that it was just like the Microsoft model in the sense that it was just a cheap portable computing device where &quot;phone&quot; was just an application on the computer. But unlike Microsoft they didn&#x27;t just take the obvious route of just shrinking down the desktop into an unusable and fussy tiny screen. They developed a different kind of interface.<p>Also, if you squint just a tiny little bit, it looks kinda like the mobile interface model that BB used, but instead of a wheel or ball or whatever to navigate and a keyboard to type, they simplified and just did everything on a bigger screen.<p>Pulling these two influences together into what we have now, and being willing to deal with the tradeoffs (lack of precision input and the &quot;feel&quot; of a keyboard + the reduced battery life and added component cost) was really innovative and daring. It was so impressive that Google completely redirected and pivoted Android from the BB model to the iPhone model.",1380667482

ShowKit is a mobile software development kit that turbo charges apps with live communication features in under 30 minutes. Before ShowKit, it would take companies and software engineers months of intensive development to add features like audio/video conferencing, screen sharing, and gesture control to their applications. Our first-to-market gesture control functionality empowers users to tap, swipe, highlight, and fully control another users screen remotely while simultaneously connecting the two users via audio/video conference.<p>Notably, ShowKit is the only framework that includes hardware accelerated video encoding & decoding. This enables 720p at 30fps, the highest quality video conferencing resolution on the market, while using minimal cpu resources and allowing the app to run seamlessly in the background while a call is taking place. Comparable solutions use full cpu resources & only achieve 4-5fps at that resolution, which isnt feasible for video conferencing.<p>AngelList Profile: <a href=""http://angel.co/showkit"" rel=""nofollow"">http://angel.co/showkit</a>

What exactly is the difference between an &quot;identification&quot; and an &quot;authenticated identification&quot;? With the family tablet, the fingerprint is still acting exactly like a password, and the reason the author is okay with it is because it&#x27;s a password that&#x27;s not protecting anything terribly important. Why not just have profiles that are selectable without any authentication? That would probably also work for a family tablet, but the fingerprint might be preferable to protect some info from your family members (even completely innocent things like shopping for gifts). Of course your family members could easily lift your fingerprint and bypass the biometrics, but it doesn&#x27;t matter.",1380666362

6479446,comment,6476836,6476836,2,0,amalcon,,,"Everyone has their own pet theory of how people should behave in traffic.  The problem isn&#x27;t even that most of them are wrong -- most of them are &quot;correct&quot; in the sense that, if everyone behaved in this way, traffic jams would be less common and have shorter durations.<p>The problem is that you don&#x27;t know which theories other drivers have, so you don&#x27;t know how they will react to different situations.  If you don&#x27;t know how other drivers will react, you need to drive conservatively -- which usually means slowing down.<p>Take a construction merge down to a single lane.  It might be the case that it&#x27;s best to use both lanes up to the merge, so that the traffic jam takes up less space.  It might be the case that it&#x27;s best to merge as soon as you figure out what&#x27;s going on, to provide more time for the merge negotiation and reduce the risk of accidents at the merge point.<p>In reality, it doesn&#x27;t matter either way.  If I try to use both lanes, I don&#x27;t know that I&#x27;ll be allowed to merge at the lane closure.  If I merge early, I don&#x27;t know if someone is going to use the now-unoccupied lane to zoom up and cut someone off, making both lanes slower and more accident-prone.  I can&#x27;t do either one and confidently say that I&#x27;ve made the correct choice, because I don&#x27;t know how other drivers will react.  What I do is just pick one, and slow down when something unexpected happens.<p>This article also generalizes some things incorrectly (it seems based mainly on German data, presumably because they have better infrastructure for measuring such).  For example,  I live in the northeastern U.S.  We are notoriously bad drivers up here, even among other east coasters.  Here, a two-second following distance at 65MPH is almost unheard of -- actually, a two-second front-to-rear distance probably qualifies as a &quot;large space&quot;, as some people here seem to think such a space can fit multiple vehicles.  That&#x27;s about 100ft or 30m, so I suppose it technically can, but it is not safe.<p>I can react to this either by leaving a very large space (5-6 seconds seems sufficiently large that people get impatient and leave before it fills up) or by leaving a small space (.75-1.25 seconds is the largest I can leave and have a good chance of nobody trying to use it).  The former is much safer, so that&#x27;s what I do.<p>The key is that, over a period of about two minutes, I need to maintain this following distance relative to the same vehicle.  Usually this is fine:  at most three cars tend to use that space at a time, and if anything they&#x27;re more likely to tailgate the vehicle I&#x27;m following than to stay back near me.  Occasionally I need to slow down in a situation where many vehicles fill that space, or someone moves in and immediately slows down.  This is the exception, rather than the rule.<p>Yes, I know this behavior can cause traffic jams under certain conditions and with certain other drivers -- but so could the alternative, under other conditions.  Given the choice between two bad options, I optimize for my personal safety.",1380666186

Low end Android phones definitely replaced a lot of Symbian phones in the marketplace.

The notion of getting disrupted by higher cost phones--not iPhone for a Symbian but a smart phone for a flip phone--was so unthinkable and invisible that for three years the two companies under discussion here made do selling to emerging markets. It&#x27;s essentially a tale of how the market and leadership at these companies do not see disruptions from above coming, and if they do see them coming being in a paradoxical state of needing to reverse course on a (thus far) successful strategy.<p><i>Not seeing how this follows from the data... There is a real chance of smartphones getting commodotized</i><p>Nobody is arguing that smart phones haven&#x27;t been commoditized.

The default scientific assumption under these circumstances is that there&#x27;s no effect, and as it happens, there&#x27;s no evidence to contradict this assumption, and plenty to support it.<p>I posted what I did because it&#x27;s relatively new and unfamiliar to many of psychology&#x27;s advocates. As to talk therapy, these findings are in some cases decades old, with no change in the outcome.",1380664863

The above statement shows why people who have only been in business for a short time, and specifically only in tech, have no long term view of how quickly someone can be on top and then &quot;poof&quot;. I have heard over the years many stories like that spanning many different businesses.<p>I have a friend whose father in law is a &quot;garmento&quot;. Runs a big factory and imports things from the Dominican Republic, Asia, China etc. Lately he told me of the problems they are having just as a result of there being less department stores than there were 5 years ago. This was a business that did really well for many many years. All the sudden a formula that worked doesn&#x27;t work anymore.  And these people were on the top of the world for so many years.",1380664862

My iPhone 4S 64Gb is worth about 200 second hand. Even a new 8Gb 4S, the cheapest model available new, is 349.<p>Anyone interested in my second hand phone was almost certainly never going to spring for a new iPhone.<p>The market for second hand iPhones does next to nothing to cannibalise the market for new iPhones (which Apple cares about) and strengthens the iOS ecosystem (both by bringing in new customers who might buy apps, music and movies but also keeping customers away from competing platforms).<p>There&#x27;s more upside than downside for Apple in second hand iPhones.",1380664812

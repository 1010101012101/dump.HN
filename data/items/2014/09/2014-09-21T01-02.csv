It&#x27;s only for interactive use: when a function returns a picture, Emacs displays it. It&#x27;s not part of the file.<p>The way Racket embeds images into your source code is actually somewhat interesting. If a `.rkt` file includes a rich element (eg. image, table, GUI structure, etc.) then the result file format is not strictly human-readable anymore. Instead, the source code is stored in the homegrown &#x27;WXME&#x27; format which, while text-based, is not actually human-parsable anymore. That makes source code diffs a pain.<p>Emacs could technically parse these files on load and write them on save, but that might be a bit tricky.

Restaurants, coffee shops, airlines. Cars, computers, clothing. Music, movies, and TV shows (think about the watercooler at work). Even household products send cultural signals, insofar as they&#x27;ll be noticed when you invite friends over to your home. Any product enjoyed or discussed in the presence of your peers is ripe for cultural imprinting.<p>Your choice of coffee shop or fast food communicates something to your peers <i>if</i> you&#x27;re seen there, which, as far as I know, is often fairly uncommon, depending on your situation.  It&#x27;s nice to be culturally aware, but that doesn&#x27;t constrain your consumption of music, movies, and TV too much (especially music) unless you watch very little.  Nobody notices what brand of sneakers you&#x27;re wearing... at least, I rarely even look down that far, and I can&#x27;t believe other people are that different.  Household products?  Maybe once in a year.<p>Nor do I find all of the anecdotes convincing.<p>Bed sheets - sheets themselves may not be the hottest product category, but I&#x27;ve seen many mattress and mattress store commercials.  Tempur-pedic, Sleepy&#x27;s (I have heard that jingle so many times I doubt I will ever forget it), etc.<p>Gas stations - don&#x27;t advertise because usually you don&#x27;t have multiple stations right next to each other.  Since the service is a commodity, everyone goes to the closest station.<p>Why not two-faced - because it&#x27;s easier to remember something if it&#x27;s clear, well-defined, and repeated often, and that includes unconscious associations.

Normally the database is a sort of special-purpose component with its own resources and scaling methods. I think if someone actually did apply the full power of this system to build their whole web application logic into the database server they might run into problems if/when they need to scale up due to coupling the database and application layer. Everyone who didn&#x27;t build their web application logic in the database would pay the performance penalty for parsing / authenticating requests in a scripting language instead of in compiled C code. The database layer is one possibly rare place where people will be counting milliseconds of overhead per request as a problem.&quot; This.",1411262957

8346063,comment,8344345,8346003,1,0,roryokane,,,"That experiment would not accurately test the emotional inception theory. The theory states that given ads associating a product with a positive emotion, people will eventually feel that emotion when they <i>see</i> the product in the store, and be compelled to buy it. Your experiment tests whether people feel that emotion when they <i>use</i> the advertised product after having bought it. You might assume that these answers would match, but that is a dangerous and unnecessary assumption.<p>I have an idea for a more accurate experiment. Survey a number of people about what brands of some product they buy, if any. The product should be something that does not currently have many ads for it (like bedsheets), so that cultural imprinting is not a factor. Then send them a weekly email newsletter on some random topic. Each newsletter would also contains ads for a certain brand of that product.<p>The people would be split into two groups. For half of them, the ad for the product tries to associate the brand with a positive image. For the other half, the ad tries to associate the brand with a neutral image, while otherwise keeping the text the same. This splitting into groups ensures that “honest signaling” is not a confounding factor.<p>To ensure that the participant opens the newsletter and sees the ads, participants would be asked to search each newsletter for a piece of information and reply to the email with that information.<p>After three months of the newsletters, participants would be surveyed again about what brands of the product they buy, if any. If emotional imprinting theory is accurate, the participants who were shown the positive images should have increased their purchasing of that brand of product more than the neutral-image participants increased their purchasing.",1411262778

A sorrier state.<p>You could definitely do something like what you ask. You could do something even nicer using a type family indexed on Nat. That all said, I don&#x27;t know that I&#x27;m convinced that it&#x27;s actually what was discussed in Hickey&#x27;s slides even if his notation suggested it. You don&#x27;t want your output changing at each step—you want the &quot;sink&quot; end of the applied transducer to pick the output and the &quot;source&quot; side to just treat it opaquely.<p>Internal states stored local to a transduction &quot;step&quot; might be valuably treated as Rich suggests, but this is exactly what the Moore machine handles—the constructor can pick the state and the user can only pass it forward with some new variable each time they &quot;open&quot; the state. Furthermore, due to purity only one &quot;sequence of reductions&quot; can survive the whole process. This gives you your indexed types much more naturally.<p>If you can think of a concrete use case where the more convoluted Nat-indexed type family would work better I&#x27;d be interested to see it.

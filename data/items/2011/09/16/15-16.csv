In response to the last part I can think of a way to achieve the sort of smart escaping via template you talk about using Haskell and Hamlet (among other templating systems used by yesod). I believe, although I can't absolutely confirm that Hamlet already performs context appropriate escaping, based mostly on the type signatures and the names of a few of the functions.",1316188742

Smaller than a multiplier obviously, but much larger than a ripple carry adder and somewhat larger even than the fancy pipelined adders used in fast CPUs.<p>It's the kind of thing that got skimped on in Atom.  Lots of stuff runs surprisingly slow on Atom.  Another one I find striking is that there are two pipes for ADD/SUB instructions, but ADC/SBB (the carry/borrow variants) are not just single-issue, but apparently unpipelined.

3004949,comment,3004080,3004080,5,0,dcosson,,,"Great post - I can get pretty OCD about the way code is written, but I have a hard time complaining about things like this without feeling like a dick since as you pointed out it's not particularly inefficient (even if there was an O(1) Clear() method, how many TabPages are we really working with that it would matter?)  But you've reassured me that it's a reasonable thing to do, especially if I know beforehand that it's a piece of code that will probably be used for a long time.<p>That said, I've learned that with an early stage startup where you're trying to iterate as quickly as possible in a desperate attempt to get <i>somebody</i> to care about your product, you often have to pick your battles.  Just yesterday I came across this:<p><pre><code>    category_count = []\n    for i in range(10):\n        category_count.append( db.execute(""SELECT count(*) FROM table WHERE category = %d"" % i) )\n</code></pre>\nFor one thing, this iterate separately and then append to list approach in Python annoys me slightly (list comprehensions are so much cooler!).  But far worse, it hits the DB 10 times instead of once, and no matter how small your site is you obviously can't be having that.  How'd it get there? Who knows.  It was written in the Django ORM, where the only way to do this is with a pretty obscure command like Object.values('category').annotate(count=Count('category')). At first we were picking up Django as we went, so at the time whoever wrote it probably had no idea that the values() or annotate() methods even existed, and the way it was written got something up on the page and working so we could decide whether or not we'd be throwing it out the next week. But, whatever, you come across something like this, go throw up, fix it and move on.  And finding these kinds of issues puts into perspective smaller ones like using a for loop where you meant to use a while loop.<p>tl;dr -  Having the luxury of sexy-ing up your your code as described in the post is strongly dependent on the stage that the project/company is in.",1316188425

PG pointed out that one of the main reasons for dot.bomb failure was not being able to technically execute (sure, the company may still have been hopeless, but they didn't even get to test their sales proposition).<p>And a lot if not most companies simply don't focus on technical excellence or even simple competance.  E.g. look at how the powers that be at Friendser let it wither on the vine because they assumes the tech was in the bag while their persued big deals, all the while ignoring for years (I think) that the system had gotten so overloaded it was essentially useless.<p>And, heck, if I had the time to mentor you and you were interested, I might take you on even at your current level.

So we decided to present at Startup Alley. It isn't cheap. We had to fly out there, it costs $2k for a table, etc. For us, its good to get out to SF every so often to visit with friends, investors, partners, etc anyway. Early on, not that many folks came by our booth (we were in the 500 startups alley, not the main one, so we were a bit away from the crowd).<p>Ultimately though, for us the exposure was worth it. We had several good meetings and customers came out of it - often it was often from folks we met at an afterparty who stopped by our table the next day.

Generally though, if you can afford it, I think it is worth going even in the alley - but you have to make the most of your opportunities...

At a time when it's convenient / possible for you to watch?  I mean, one reason things like VCRs, Tivo, Netflix, bittorrent, etc. became popular in the first place is because the content wasn't conveniently accessible by simply being in front of the TV at the right time.<p>> Netflix/iTunes/torrenting is not easier than turning on the TV (for most people).<p>I don't know... sometimes I think us geeks overstate the difference between ""us and them"" where ""them"" are ""the unwashed, untechnical masses who are deathly afraid of technology"" or whatever.

That said, on the off-chance that you actually will think about what I'm saying, here goes:<p>* The organized religious group I'm a member of, through ceremony, gives certain major life events and certain times of the week more importance and significance than they would otherwise have.  I'm not sure you'd understand the word 'sacred' - so let me describe it as a peaceful, calm feeling, where your mind is clear and the concerns of everyday life are simply not present.  These ceremonies require an organization.<p>* The organized religious group I'm a member of helps and supports each other.  In an atomizing society where we often don't know our neighbors, I belong to a community that is there for me when I'm in need.  Obviously this requires some organization.<p>* The organized religious group I'm a member of emphasizes scholarship and pushes me to learn new things.  We think deeply about the meaning of texts; we study languages.  Because we do this in an organized fashion, we push and support each other, and we get new insights that we wouldn't get as individuals.  Obviously, we can't do this without an organization.<p>* The organized religious group that I'm a member of pushes me to be a better, more moral person. We frequently discuss and debate values and morality, and challenge ourselves to do better. Without others in the community acting as role-models, I doubt I would be the person I am - still highly-flawed, but better than I would be.<p>* The organized religious group I'm a part of conveys a culture that I very much want my (not-yet-existing) children and future descendants to have. We value scholarship and learning and entrepreneurship, and we've done very well over the centuries despite persecution. The reason for this success isn't 100% genetic - and the one common cultural constant, no matter where you are in the world, is our religion. By immersing myself and my family in my religion, I hope to inculcate in my family and descendants a culture that demonstrably works well.<p>That's just a handful, but you get the idea.  If you were to chat with my rabbi, you might get a slightly different set - I'm going to ask him about this the next time I see him. But I guarantee 'influence' wouldn't come up - that's not at all why we have our shul.",1316186929

Judaism has always stressed ritual observance, not articles of faith. It's perfectly possible to be a practicing Jew while having serious questions about the nature of God. And what I said about my religion and proselytizing above is absolutely correct. (Seriously, <i>try</i> to become a Jew. We probably won't take you - unless, of course, you're already ethnically Jewish.)<p>For that matter, since you used the word ideology, there's no ideological consensus in Judaism. There is a organized community and there are rituals. It's a thinking person's religion. We argue a lot. We're not much for dogma.<p>Naturally parents raise their children how they prefer, but that's parental influence, not organized religion's influence. They're quite distinct.<p>Our religion has traditionally had minimal to no influence in the broader society. For centuries there were very real incentives to convert <i>away</i> from my religion once you were free of parental influence. We've been the subject of discrimination, pogroms, and genocide. And yet here we are, having somehow 'permeated' successfully, and we're doing just fine. How does that tie into your theories about influence and the propagation of religion - since, for many centuries, our organized religion had <i>zero</i> influence? Perhaps there might be something more to it, hmmm?<p>Of course I'm being condescending to you. I get tired of listening to people who have no knowledge or experience of my religion spout off about it.

I think in this case the condition (that the list is not empty) is deserves more emphasis than the iteration through the elements of said list - hence why I find the <i>while</i> version to be more readable. YMMV and all that :)",1316185433

Go to the Vista wiki page and every bit of referenced commentary is with respect to Windows XP, and how users still wanted to buy XP.  I didn't see any linked articles mention Apple as a competitive threat.  Wasn't Apple crawling back out of the grave when Vista planning started in 2001?  Ipod may have been a big deal when Vista was released in 2006, but the iPhone was still a rumor, and I believe the next OS X was delayed because developers had been pulled to work on iOS.<p>Unless you transport today's competitive environment back 5 years, I just don't see how this statement jives with reality.",1316185410

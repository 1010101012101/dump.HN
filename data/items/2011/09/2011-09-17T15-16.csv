In fact, those two are already separated in Rails (AREL?).<p>I don't see much of a criticism to the mapping part (and the benefits given to you in form of validation/metadata/migration/schema versioning)... In fact, unless you're going to access the records directly via the database driver API (giving way to hideous coding), you'll probably reinvent the wheel or do the O-R mapping by hand to fill POCOs/POJOs/etc, as I've seen on so many enterprise projects (in different levels of elegance).<p>But then, again, somebody please correct me if I'm wrong.",1316274885
3008296,comment,3006754,3007637,2,0,Vivtek,,,"Bah.  If the system is that unstable, then maybe we're going to destroy ourselves - but it's just as likely we'll be able to save ourselves when something entirely else would have killed us anyway.  There's no reason to think technology per se, or any particular branch of it, should be avoided because it's <i>the one</i>.<p>Look, I'll be the first to agree that technology is dangerous and human beings are pretty stupid and shortsighted when using it (and when not using it, and before breakfast, and all other times), but I just have nothing but contempt for people who think the answer is to dissuade other people from being smarter than they are, by means violent or not.<p>If you (and by this I mean the generic you) think technology is dangerous, or some specific technology is dangerous, then by all means investigate how it is dangerous, how that danger can be avoided, and before all else <i>become a better person</i> and demonstrate by your life that a race to destruction is not where humanity should be.  I know that's all kumbayah and people probably won't even understand what I mean, but seriously, the answer is just to become a better humanity.  The answer is <i>always</i> to become a better humanity.  I personally think we're doing OK on that, current news notwithstanding (because the current news is always alarming, but the trends are towards a more human humanity).<p>Well.  This isn't an argument, just a viewpoint.  I got work to do and probably shouldn't be engaging in philosophy.<p>Oh, except one more point: global warming is going to be expensive, but it's not going to kill us.  It's not the first time Earth has run a fever, and we're not Venus yet.  Even in the (I believe) colossally unlikely event that we crash our technological civilization or even drive ourselves and a bunch of other things to extinction, the planet's going to be just fine, and life will go on.",1316274873

3008289,comment,3008066,3008066,14,0,ggchappell,,,"This is an interesting discussion -- interesting in part because it addresses a mindset that I don't seem to have.<p>C++, for example, has multiple inheritance, and I have used it to good effect. OTOH, if I needed to implement Dijkstra's Alg in C++, then I don't think it would even occur to me to inherit from both a priority queue and a directed graph base class. (And even now that it does occur to me, it doesn't seem to be a good idea.) Rather, I'd use something akin to the interfaces presented here. Of course, interfaces are not formalized in C++, but the C++ culture does include the notion of a <i>concept</i>, to be used with a template.<p>If the language were Python, I'd proceed similarly. And then there's Java, which doesn't even have multiple inheritance. I've never heard anyone claim that Java is somehow ill-suited for the implementation of graph algorithms (but maybe it is -- never thought about it).<p>Perhaps what this discussion is overturning, is not so much a <i>multiple-inheritance</i> mindset, as an <i>Eiffel</i> mindset. (But I don't know much Eiffel, so it's hard to say.) And the discussion also suggests that Go's formalization of interfaces can be a Good Thing.",1316274738

would be out whatever money they put in. That's why
I wrote to ask questions. Its obvious though that the
""public"" didn't think the same way and gave him money.<p>Alternatively the fact is that it would have been fairly easy for Washington to do all the right things, collect money, and make off with that money very easily. Right things that might have even fooled me. It's not hard to come up with an identity. On linkedin as anyone who uses it
now knows you can easily put up credentials and get people
to be your contacts. You can easily put up a site you could
even put up a site and make it appear that you run or work
at an actual company. You could simply copy the website of
a legitimate engineering company and change a few names
and identifying information and make a convincing site.<p>Now nothing about this is new of course you could have
done this before kickstarter and defrauded people.<p>It's just easier now. Part of the friction is gone. Kickstarter makes it easy to throw something out there

I grew up in an American household in Germany.  My parents spoke just enough German to get by, and my older sisters spoke German quite fluently because they attended German public schools.

My mother taught me to read English at home, to the point where I could read age-appropriate children's books on my own by the time I was four, but she didn't teach me to read or write German.<p>In Germany, what we call ""Pre-school"" is called ""Kindergarten,"" and what we call ""Kindergarten"" is called ""Vor-schule,"" which literally translates as ""Pre-school.""  My parents never put me in Kindergarten, so my first day of school was the first day of Vor-schule.  They enrolled me at a German public school.  As you might expect, all instruction was in German.  <i>Most</i>, but not all, of the teachers spoke fluent English, but none of the other children spoke any English.  The teachers would not speak English to me as part of instruction, but would for other issues (e.g. going to the bathroom).

Such a group can do more planning/design and provide ongoing support for the client non-profit.  I also agree with the idea of doing this at some minor fee, nothing to break the bank for the client.

It's an old method: repetition and practice to build base fundamentals so you can apply them to more complex problems.

It's also a lot easier for me to commit 1-3 hours every day.  There's an idea that you need to learn a lot up front, and then you're a ""programmer"".  Doing 1-3 hours of learning a day, gets you in the habit of ALWAYS learning.  You never know enough, so it's not a 3-4 month process where you come out at the other end and you're done.  I think 1-3 hours a day is manageable by everyone, and you don't ever run into diminishing returns for the day.<p>That doesn't apply to actually programming.  If you're building something, and you have the time, more hours in the day is generally better.  If the focus is on learning, 1-3 hours is probably good for most people, and something that's easy to keep up with for years.",1316271829

It's true that ORMs are merely bandaids on what is essentially an intractable set-theoretical problem, but we've learned over the years that in the right hands an ORM is a tremendous productivity boost, provided the team is aware of the limitations. In fact Martin Fowler's original definition of the ActiveRecord pattern in Patterns of Enterprise Application Architecture describes some of these limitations from the very beginning.<p>""Unfortunately, these advantages disappear as the project increases in complexity: the abstraction breaks down, forcing the dev to use and understand SQL""<p>""Forced"" to use and understand SQL? I think you have a basic misunderstanding of the purpose of ORMs, Laurie. The developer who can't use and understand SQL really has no business going near the ORM. They probably need to stay somewhere near the front-end doing design, layout and UI-centric work.<p>The purpose of an ORM, properly used, is <i>not at all</i> to completely remove SQL from the developer's toolkit, but to help developers who fully understand SQL and Objects eliminate boilerplate SQL. This has a huge dual benefit of productivity boost plus elimination of bugs by the reduction of code/SQL duplication.<p>If an ORM developer is not aware of SQL (i.e., watching their rails log for odd queries/joins) and the natural problems that arise, such as n+1, etc. then they probably shouldn't be writing data-layer concerns. ORMs are for experienced developers who know how to use things like the ActiveRecord or DataMapper DSLs when appropriate, and can also drop into straight SQL when appropriate. ORMs are power tools for serious developers who can use them for what they do well, and know how to avoid their weaknesses, which you outline well here.<p>Because of their benefit and the cumulative experience we've had in the last 10 years or so getting to know <i>how</i> to use ORMs effectively, they're not going away any time soon. However, they certainly have their pitfalls and it's important that we have posts like these every few years or so to remind us what those pitfalls are. So thanks!",1316271825

It was made up of macros and was enough to show the basics of programming if not language. Shortly after that I was handed my professors old copy of Susan Stern's book on IBM BAL. For those who have never had the pleasure, it is (was?) very near a high level language even if it had a low level implementation. My first observation was that there was very little difference (meta) from planning a piece of sculpture to planning a program. As I joked, the biggest difference was clean-up; with code, you just turn things off, with sculpture you spend a fair amount of time with physical work. My first significant project was building a concordance generator---a key words in context generator from a given corpus. This meant not only the usual trapping of text in, new text out with no library to aid, but taking quick-sort apart and writing it in assembler. Looking back it was one of the harder things I've ever done; but that said, also one of the most enjoyable. There after I began the usual progression, skipped PL1, took FORTRAN etc. I was introduced to C at the New Jersey Computer Faire by Scott Guthrie who was selling a version of Small C, enough to get a leg up. Then BDS C on my 8085. Looking back, I've loon since adopted an approach of 'What have I lost, what have I gained' with regards to the language and syntax. Programming itself remains the same, although some things are easier to express in some languages versus others (Noam Chomsky and 'Language conditions thought' seems to apply to computer languages in my opinion.) Over the years, it is the usual 'Wash, rinse, repeat' with regard to language with the selection dependent on what the client wants or provides.",1316271692

What do you think? Did you ever learn something that had a positive impact on your business by reading stuff on the net? Is reading of any use? Or is it all about acting?",1173901958

4196,comment,4193,4193,0,0,python_kiss,,,"It all boils down to this: when a VC invests money in a startup, they are putting their reputation on the line. So imposing some control over the startup just seems natural. Imagine if you had to trust $11 million on a group of strangers; installing one of their own on the startup's board gives them a birds eye view of how their money is being spent. ",1173900273
4195,comment,4193,4193,0,0,staunch,,,"My guess is most of the time the VCs are nervous about the business or don't get along with the people they're replacing. They want to install blindly loyal and controllable ""yes men"" to feel secure.<p>Bringing in suits is still considered standard operating procedure. It's a shame how many mini-John Scully  incidents (minus the happy ending) occur. ArsDigita is a famous example, and I imagine there have been hundreds of less dramatic and less public instances.<p>It does seem like there would be legitimate scenarios where replacing top people may be necessary. Most of the time I would regard it as a likely-fatal symptom of a serious condition.",1173900075

4190,comment,4101,4101,0,0,ericwan,,,"I'd say there're two kinds of startups which are unknown to mainstream America. One is the kinds the general public have actually used, but just may not realize that is a service provided by a startup company. This includes the likes of Slide or Meebo, which many more people have put their widgets on their blogs/Myspace than going on to their proprietary website. These startups are fine; they may just need more PR to the mainstream media.<p>The startups that are really hard to reach mainstreams are those me-too startups, which are those ""social network for XX"" or ""youtube cross wikipedia"" kind of thing that users could not tell a slight difference from the sites that they have been using.",1173899311

Digg users are indeed obsessed with lists. I once posted an article to Digg titled ""9 Inventions Edison Did Not Make"" along with ""Anatomy of a successful social network"". Both reached the frontpage; but the former received 500 more Diggs than the latter, eventhough I must've spent 20x more time writing ""Anatomy of a successful social network"".<p>Digg users have severe ADD; they like to consume information fast, and then get out of the site. Lists let them do just that.",1173899081

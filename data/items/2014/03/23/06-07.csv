I anticipate a large class-ation suit and payout within the next few years, because they took this to wildly abusive levels. For example a few years ago I went out one day and made 2 small (<$10) debit card purchases, passed an ATM of my bank and made a cash deposit, and then made a larger purchase an hour later (which was why I had deposited the cash, as I had a low balance). Chronologically this was all good, but thanks to transaction re-ordering I got hit with $105 in fees (#35 x 3).* I got it reversed, but the sad fact is that for a long time the transactions shown on your account and your available balance were treated as fictions to be re-arranged at the bank&#x27;s convenience if doing so would yield fee income.<p>* <i>eg for illustration, though I don&#x27;t remember the specifics:</i><p><pre><code>  a. starting balance       $30\n  b. debit card      -$10 = $20\n  c. debit card      -$10 = $10\n  d. cash deposit    +$60 = $70\n  e. debit card      -$65 = $ 5\n</code></pre>\n<i>Which all looked fine at the time (eg checking recent transactions and available balance at ATM following deposit), but 24 hours later the transactions had been reordered from smallest to largest and my account looked like this:</i><p><pre><code>  a. starting balance       $30\n  e. debit card      -$65 =-$35\n  A. Overdraft fee!  -$35 =-$70\n  d. cash deposit    +$60 =-$10\n  b. debit card      -$10 =-$20\n  B. Overdraft fee!  -$35 =-$55\n  c. debit card      -$10 =-$65\n  C. Overdraft fee!  -$35=-$100\n</code></pre>\n<i>I wish I were making this up, but sadly not. I was just lucky enough to have the smarts and time to go into a branch and browbeat a manager into getting the charges reversed. However, my understanding is that millions of people have been ripped off by this trick in recent years.</i>",1395556980

I personally think advocates of BI are committing the Soros reflexivity mistake, which pretty much most of the field of economics sins against as well. Without a near-free energy source, I doubt BI works over the long-haul. But that doesn&#x27;t mean when someone advocates testing BI by telling supporters to dig into their pockets even deeper after they have paid taxes they currently are liable for, that I will idly stand by and let that pass for a fair challenge.

Good programmers also tend not to realise just how much better they are, and are generally unwilling/unable to demand higher salaries (not because they&#x27;re programmers, but because most people <i>by default</i> aren&#x27;t good at these things.)<p>2.

More importantly, some people make 300-500k in roundabout ways.

We are still wasting money on AI.<p>We are wasting money on AI because we are following the materialist hypothesis: that there is nothing in the universe besides matter and energy, and the interactions between matter and energy.  To reject this hypothesis is unthinkable for many, even for most, because the only alternative hypothesis would be that some sort of non-material (spiritual?) stuff must exist.<p>But the evidence is overwhelming.  The evidence cannot be denied.<p>Linguistics, for example, has always been divided into syntax and semantics.  No linguist has ever challenged this taxonomy.  Both syntax and semantics are very real.<p>Computers are syntactic engines.  They do syntax.  They can only do syntax.  It matters if a symbol is present, or not, and it matters in what order symbols are arranged.  But the computer does not, and indeed cannot, associate any meaning (semantics) with any symbol.  The only way a computer, being only a syntactical engine, can appear to do semantics, is if a human has first been clever enough to have found a mapping in some natural language between syntax and semantics [and such mapping must exist in the first place, for him to find it], and then clever enough to exploit it.  The computer is still doing only syntax, even while appearing to do semantics.<p>Searle showed this also with his Chinese Room analogy.  But the &quot;cognitive scientists&quot; have not been paying attention.  Or they are still in denial.<p>But humans really do semantics.  Nobody questions this, or challenges it, because it is self-evident.  You are doing semantics right now, as you read my comment.<p>Because humans really do semantics, and computers cannot, humans and computers must be fundamentally different sorts of creatures.  The idea that the human mind is software, running on the hardware of a human brain, must <i>necessarily</i> be false.  (If it was true, then humans couldn&#x27;t do semantics either, but they do!)<p>If this wasn&#x27;t enough, Nagel (of &quot;What is it like to be a bat?&quot; fame) has shown that the materialistic hypothesis is almost certainly wrong, in his recent book &quot;Mind and Cosmos&quot;.\n<a href=""http://www.Amazon.com/Mind-Cosmos-Materialist-Neo-Darwinian-Conception/dp/0199919755"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.Amazon.com/Mind-Cosmos-Materialist-Neo-Darwinian-...</a><p>But the world pays no attention to Nagel either.

But we don&#x27;t even have to go back that far to get broken sites. IE 8 (released in 2009), forced on many corporate workers, is unable to render many &quot;modern&quot; sites. Some specific examples that I&#x27;ve encountered: Lifehacker & kin - multiple content blocks overlapping, rendering the main content unreadable; NPR - home page totally broken, can&#x27;t get to different news categories; GigaOM - ARTICLES ARE PRESENTED IN ALL CAPS FOR NO GOOD REASON, AS IF THE AUTHOR WANTED TO SHOUT AT ME FOR USING SUCH AN OLD BROWSER.<p>And your 4) we could do that in the 90s as well. Email isn&#x27;t a 21st century invention and doesn&#x27;t depend on web technologies. Same with instant messengers. Skype - for video, bandwidth is the thing the 90s lacked to support this system. WhatsApp - widespread mobile devices was necessary for this, 90s lacked that. And none of them, other than Facebook, is wholly dependent on <i>web</i> stuffs, they&#x27;re internet technologies and platforms.",1395554490

However, this problem doesn&#x27;t seem solved by filtering the content: it seems like it should be solved by not tricking people into automatically following pages just because they liked the brand as an entity as opposed to the content on Facebook coming from that brand. Facebook has a weird and unfortunate mix of &quot;like&quot; and &quot;follow&quot; behaviors, especially with regards to the &quot;favorite X&quot; part of the profile. One thing I will say, though: they at least did separate like vs. follow at some point, which at least makes this issue solvable by the user.",1395554426

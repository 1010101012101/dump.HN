As such it existed for centuries without any external adoption outside Israel (not that it&#x27;s practitioners meant it for other peoples anyway).<p>What caught on in Roman times, and was revolutionary, was the New Testament. That was the &quot;good (new) message&quot; (the Gospel) that caught on, and that&#x27;s where the fundamental change in mores is contained in.<p>Unfortunately there are a lot of &quot;Christians&quot; these days that are more for Old Testament than the New Testament part of the bible (as did the most conservative people in previous centuries too).<p>Consider Jesus treatment of outsiders, thieves, low-ranking people, beggars, prostitutes, criminals etc. (as portrayed in the gospels, I&#x27;m not saying it happened as such in real life), and how e.g. church-going &quot;christians&quot; think of and treat such people.<p>[Add.] Now, as to what you said about &quot;batting an eye&quot;, actually there were several advocates for the abolition of slavery in christianity, and a long-going internal discussion about the issue. At worst, christian thinkers were for the humane and brotherly treatment of slaves (as opposed to downright abolition of slavery), which is still improved than the older views on the rights of masters. They also accepted slaves as saints (something that would sound preposterous to Romans before).<p>In fact a lot if not most of the early adopters, so to speak, of the new religion in Rome were slaves themselves -- not talking openly about abolition was to protect themselves and because it was an ancient and accepted institution that took ages to erode, one which not everybody (slaves included) thought unnatural at the time. Not unlike sweatshop labor today (which you see well educated libertarians and the like accepting still, as better than poverty).<p>Heck, slavery was still practiced by open minded, modern, post-industrial revolution and enlightenment countries, not just in the US until the Civil War, but in most of European countries that had colonies until the &#x27;50s (and even in the US, the same tradition carried on in the form of officially sanctioned Jim Crow and segregation laws).",1446738066

You may be able to get the DUI and assault cases consolidated, even though they are separate incidents. You may be able to take a stiffer sentence on the DUI to avoid the penalty on the assault. Just as an example, I was able to get two completely unrelated charges almost a year apart consolidated. Took a stiffer sentence (longer, more prohibitive probation) to avoid certain jail time on the greater charge. My lawyer was able to get probation on the greater charge to run simultaneous with the other probation. So I served one year of hard probation (curfew, almost daily monitoring, and constant monitoring of my home and business), instead of two years in jail.<p>As for the girl turning herself in, if she is the one that actually committed the theft she may be worth more to the prosecutors in terms of conviction than your assault charge. Just like a getaway driver turning in the bank robber. The bank robber is who they really want, and in most cases they will let the getaway driver off with a slap on the wrist if they help get the bank robber convicted.<p>I can&#x27;t reiterate enough though that I am not a lawyer, not familiar with your case, and this by no means legal advice by any stretch. The only honest, been there done that, advice I can give you at this point is that in situations like this you need to step back and assess the direction you are headed. If you are truly remorseful, this was a slip in judgment, and you are honestly wanting to get your life headed in the right direction, you need to remove yourself from your current circles. Snitches get stitches is all fine and great when all you aspire to is life on the streets or in jail, but if you want to change for the better you have to look out for yourself first.

In terms of how we&#x27;re a &quot;Slack alternative&quot;, we think Slack is a fantastic product, especially in terms of workflow, so we decided to model our chat interface off their good work. As you&#x27;ll quickly see, we&#x27;re not nearly as feature-rich at Slack at this point (nor are we aimed at the same audience). Features that define Slack, like search, are harder to pull off in an end-to-end system, but they&#x27;re areas of growing research, and we&#x27;re excited to try our hand there.<p>Also, we wanted to just give a shout-out to some  technologies we&#x27;ve had the pleasure of using:<p>1) Clojure. Our entire backend is in Clojure, and our frontend, Clojurescript.<p>2) Zerotier. A great and simple way to get our backend services to talk to one another with end-to-end encryption.<p>3) Emscripten/Asm.js for transpiled, fast in-app crypto.<p>4) Skein/Threefish and TweetNaCl.<p>5) Cassandra and Redis for our data store and key management, respectively.<p>6) ZeroMQ for communicating between our services.<p>Thanks to all involved in the projects above who are helping us get to secure collaboration!",1446736535

The idea is that everyone can conduct their affairs in peace under our laws, and that those laws will <i>allow</i> (note, not <i>guarantee</i>, as the government can&#x27;t force someone to be productive or useful) individuals to prosper and flourish by protecting their fundamental natural freedoms.<p>Government does <i>not</i> exist solely to &quot;protect those who can&#x27;t protect themselves&quot;. Whether a person has substantial physical resources with which to &quot;protect himself&quot; or not, that person can petition the government for relief and participate in the democratic process.<p>The thing here is that &quot;protect people who can&#x27;t protect themselves&quot; is so generic it can mean anything, just like &quot;the pursuit of happiness&quot; or promotion of &quot;the general welfare&quot;. Do you mean protecting employers against employees that want to steal time or goods? Do you mean protecting workers against idlers who want to consume their resources without having done anything to earn them? What about protecting companies against frivolous lawsuits from people just trying to get a big settlement? These likely aren&#x27;t the problems you&#x27;re thinking about, but they&#x27;re the problems some people out there are thinking about.<p>See what I&#x27;m saying? People are going to bias their opinion to favor their individual circumstances, but again, we all have to live under the government&#x27;s rule, and it needs to be as fair and equitable as possible for <i>everyone</i>.

There are some major no-no's in that code.<p>1) You shouldn't lock on a type, because it can deadlock the entire CLR process (Type works like a multiton in .NET, so you get one actual instance per distinct type loaded into your AppDomain). MSDN points this out, in the docs on the Monitor class (I think) -- which is what lock() uses internally.<p>2) If you use Delegate.BeginInvoke(), it executes on a threadpool thread. Since you only get a limited number of these threads per process (by default), if you run a long-running calculation, you might end up freezing some other parts of your code. This is of particular importance in ASP.NET, since it makes heavy use of the ThreadPool.<p>3) If you loop over the EndInvoke() calls there, you're going to end up blocking on each one to wait for the threads to complete. While you obviously need to wait for all of the threads to finish, you might be tying up ThreadPool threads if some threads are stuck waiting to return results.<p>Here's some more info on this: <a href=""http://www.lukepuplett.com/2009/05/using-delegates-oh-for-f-sake-moment.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.lukepuplett.com/2009/05/using-delegates-oh-for-f-...</a><p>Also, I remember reading that the CLR team had to make some major changes under the hood to the ThreadPool and other related classes in order to get the parallel extensions to perform like they should.",1264031611

I don't care if it works for the NYT or not, and if it does, great. I probably won't subscribe, but that's another tangent.<p>What does concern me is how or whether good journalism and writing will survive. I buy and read a few fiction and non-fiction books per year, far more than the average American although probably far less than the average HNer. I assume that ereaders will be made to my liking RSN, at which time I will buy few if any paper books. (I will greatly lament the loss of large and odd format books, much more profoundly than I currently miss vinyl album art.)<p>I assume that the trend will continue, and production of content in and of itself will be decreasingly lucrative. So trying to rely on selling content, or access to content, is going to get harder. Books will probably last a bit longer; if a news article is paywalled you can probably find a similar article elsewhere for free or cheaper, but in most cases there is no substitute for reading a particular story by a particular author. But in the end, even books won't be enough to make a living.<p>So what do you do if people won't buy what you're selling (access to)? ... Anything else!<p>In the case of journalism and books, what you can do is make those things the attraction to something <i>else</i> that people are willing to pay for.<p>In the case of newspapers, I'm not sure what they would sell besides advertising, but it'll have to be something. Maybe more in depth coverage of the same story (but attracting with mere summaries won't work). Maybe video about the story or related subjects.<p>Maybe instead of selling advertising for stuff, they'll sell the stuff directly. ""Nice car Bob."" ""Like it? I'm leasing it from the New York Times.""<p>For some authors, they might sell editing services, book design and similar to other authors. 100 years ago miners went broke and died looking for gold, but the hardware stores and outfitters made a good living supplying the miners. If you're an author that other writers like, that could be one way to make a living.<p>Bottom line is revenue is being siphoned or disappearing, and you'll have to change.",1264031283

1066117,story,,,2,0,d0m,"Idea of company, what you think?",,"Hey, since a couple of months, I had this idea and I was really excited to finish my last classes to start my company. However, as you will probably guess it, it looks a lot like google calendar..<p>Here it is: A web/mobile app to add events/tasks and being able to share everything with friends. Here's what differences it from the actual google calendar:\n - Possibility to follow friends and have a live feed of what they are attending right now.. (i.e. Marie and Bob has just attended mathematic class, etc.)<p>- Possibility to see in real time who's present in your event. For instance, suppose you go to a python conference, if someone that you don't know is attending this conference, it will be possible to add this contact (if this person wants, of course).<p>- Possibility to ask friends for When and Where they want to do something. For instance, I can invite 3 of my friends for tuesday, wednesday and friday in 3 differents restaurant.. in real time, they see the invitation and choose what they like.. and when I know what my friends want, I can create the event.<p>- I thought of a kind of concept for a smart task where your tasks follow you in your calendar during all day instead of being static or in a list. For instance, when I'll look at my calendar, it will say: Do X homework, and then, I can either do it or skip it by saying to not bother me with it for a week.. and, there could be a kind of smart IA that could predict the more important tasks (My homework for tomorow might be more important than the one in 1month, or whatever..) The important part here is that all tasks will ""pop"" in the calendar presently (and of course, it will be possible to see them all).<p>- Smart alarm such as: Always wake me up 1 hours before my first event in the calendar school. This could be useful to me at least.<p>- Smart reminder such as: Keeping a feed of reminder of events in exponential or something time. For instance, my event of a python conference in 6 months could automatically remind me in 5 month, then 2 weeks before, then the day before.<p>- When an event is created, it could be possible to add it on facebook in the same time.<p>- Now this one was for the long term.. but hey: dentist could add events to you without knowing your email address or your account. How? Because you both know your dentist ID. The dentist would add an event to this ID and on your side, you'll add this ID to your account. This could make the decision to switch to this technology really easier for companies. The school could show your schedule with your personnal school number, etc..<p>- People could search public events and sync the calendar in their own calendar (But now, it's possible in google calendar). So, it would have been possible to register to hockey matches, BUS schedule, artists tourney. And, people could register on a feed of publicity event that they like.. For instance, suppose I'm in the mood of buying a new laptop and I don't know what a mac is, I could register to laptop publicities.. so all publicity shown to me would interest me. I think this could be awesome for seller.. I could register to special 50% days to buy my new tv, etc..<p>- Finally, for the money part, I thought every user would have it free. However, company could pay to have their own domain. For instance, if my university would like to show me my schedule with my number, they could go public.. or buy their own private domain with like 1000 possibile calendars. My-university/mathematic/mat1141 would be official instead of mathematic/mat1141 where everyone could create public events of that name.<p>- Also, seller would pay to be able to show publicity.<p>So, as you see, this is a big project and I really wanted to start it. However, I'm not sure anymore.. does it make really a difference between this and google calendar? Could I use google calendar to develop something like this? Should I find a new idea - something simpler maybe?<p>Thanks for your time,<p>dom",1264030910

1066111,comment,1065748,1065748,0,0,grellas,,,"Most startups need to have barriers to entry if they are to have the capacity to sustain themselves beyond the initial phase of their existence.<p>This is one of the first questions that potential investors will ask any founding team: assuming that you initially succeed, what is to prevent big players from attacking you. More often than not, the answer lies in the IP protections that protect such a startup's development efforts, whether this takes the form of patents, copyrights, or whatever. It is true that such startups can also be prejudiced by threats of infringement from large companies and in this sense IP rights can potentially work against them. In my experience, though, for every oddball situation (easily less than 1%) in which IP rights threaten a startup, there are many, many situations where IP rights work in their favor and in which they would clearly be prejudiced if such rights were scaled back or eliminated.<p>Thus, from my subjective perspective, I can attest that IP rights <i>are</i> a spur to innovation because many of the startups I have represented would not have been able either to start or to fund themselves without a business model that ultimately depended on proprietary advantages afforded by IP rights. Perhaps they are wrong about what does or does not promote the best interests of their companies but, in the real world, this is overwhelmingly how most founders see IP in relation to their companies.<p>Can't speak to the broader societal or cost/benefit issues raised by the author (and would agree that patents in particular are in need of reform). By the way, as I do not do patent filings, this is not a livelihood issue for me - just my viewpoint as a lawyer representing startups for over a quarter century in Silicon Valley.",1264030760

The only thing I can remember where a fashion designer attempted to incorporate tech is those sneakers with the LEDs in the heels... and since they were a fashion, they provoked strong opinions, had their time and went away.<p>As far as air travel security goes, very few people fly that often and it will be dealt with like we deal with laptops and mp3 players now. Just don't show up with some homebrew contraption (MIT student LED shirt reference).",1264028700

The only difference between stealing music and stealing groceries is the music is significantly easier to steal. The convenience and low likelihood of getting caught is the only reason its so rampant. But it's still stealing.<p>Accept the reality of it? Accept that things are just going to be stolen and that's that? What kind of society is that? I'd like to think we can rise above being selfish vigilantes who only choose to see things through their own eyes instead of work with society as a whole.",1264028507

Wouldn't a college kid flying home for the weekend with only a backpack like to pay less than somebody taking a two week trip with three large suitcases?<p>Let's presume that the airlines will price in a profit optimizing way and that, in the long term, competition will limit their overall take.  So, compared to a model where all passengers pay an all-inclusive fee, those using fewer services will pay less under the a-la-carte plan.<p>We don't think that hotels should be required to include dinner in the cost of the room, but we get mad when the airline charges $5 for an in-flight meal.  We're happy to pay per-lb to ship stuff via UPS, but we don't want to pay per-lb for the bags we check?  I don't understand.",1264028438

Clearly there is some stuff on there that does need discretion if it's genuinely endangering lives and there are parts that should be redacted for the public interest. But the coverage from The New York Times and other traditional media as well as across the web shows there is genuine public interest and public good served in exposure of where there is wrong doing. There is clearly scope for sensible discourse about it. But I don't believe in government assassination hit-lists or smear campaigns and trumped up sex crime charges as a replacement for honest discourse over matters of genuine and valid fourth estate purview.",1291622322

1974335,comment,1974056,1974281,0,0,shock-value,,,"Eh, at least in my personal experience, Facebook hasn't been that big of a deal to me. And I suspect it's the same for lots of its casual users (which I further suspect make up most of its userbase).<p>Yes, you are right, in terms of ""one-way"" communication (status updates etc), it lets you keep tabs on your friends more easily. But that sort of status-updating functionality wasn't even in there (or at least emphasized) until Twitter came along. So give them some credit. And even then, I think you overestimate just how much people share on Facebook. I've noticed that some (like 10-15%) of my fb friends constantly post updates, pictures, etc., while the others (while still maintaining a ""presence"" on the site) just don't. And for the purposes of this post, I actually went and checked a few friends' profiles to be sure it wasn't just that I was only seeing a select few on my feed, heh. (I'm one of the ones who don't share much, and these days I don't even check Facebook much actually.)<p>In terms of two-way communication, it's only real innovation was to allow others to follow along with the conversation. Which is a pretty big deal, of course--allowing others to join in on digital conversations is a big boon. But that's really it... the rest of its functionality isn't as big of a deal and frankly was scraped from other sites anyway (even being able to follow a conversation on a profile based website was an idea from Myspace actually).<p>That's my take anyway. I've been on Facebook since 2006 (well, on and off--deleted my profile for about a year then made a new one a few months ago), and honestly it really hasn't been a part of my life nearly to the extent that computers and all the other services they provide have been. And for what its worth, I'm a pretty social, outgoing person, so my viewpoint shouldn't be slanted by introversion.<p>Anyway, sorry for the rambling post.<p>EDIT: I should add (as danieldon noted) that events are a genuinely useful feature that Facebook had before any other site (to my knowledge). I give them credit for that. Anything else is pretty much fluff though, and while I understand the idea that even vacuous communication should lead to greater trust and social bonds in the real world, I disagree that that actually happens in practice.",1291619927

Wow. I couldn't disagree more. Event notifications are probably the only thing that is substantially more useful in facebook as far as I can tell. Aside from that, the only additional knowledge I've gained from facebook is that a handful of people who I barely remember from high school really like reposting stuff from r/pics.

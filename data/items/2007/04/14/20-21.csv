12958,comment,12942,12942,0,0,gibsonf1,,,"Interesting point.  I agree that the biggest procrastination inducing disincentive to <i>starting</i> creative work is the preconception in the creator's mind that ""this will be a great thing - I will make it perfect"", etc.  I learned while designing in architectural school that the key to good design was to strip away all preconceptions about a problem before starting - which is dramatically harder than it sounds.  The preconception of a quest for perfection before starting is the most important one.<p>However, once you have ""programmed"" your conscious mind with the problem, allowed your subconscious to crunch on it and give you the first draft of a solution to the problem, the quest for making it as good as possible is key to actually having it be good.  With that first solution, you can then refine it, with the idea of making it increasingly better. The question then is when do you stop (or go live) - a very important point.   The beauty of web development is that you can think of the project as an evolution toward being very good from somewhat humble beginnings.  This makes it that much easier to come to the good-enough point faster than in the past stand-alone application days, but then continue improving as long as the project continues to be exciting.  The ""lets make it better"" drive is a really important motivator, at least it is for me.\n",1176583967

12952,comment,12928,12928,0,0,epall,,,"Any company that bets on banner ads seems at-risk to me. If somebody can go get a browser plugin (AdBlock) and kill all banners with very little effort, what's to stop most users from doing that? At this point it's mostly techies who've figured out they can block ads, but it seems only a matter of time before the techies do it for their parents, friends, and coworkers. Banner ads are invasive and annoying so there's strong motivation to kill them.",1176583159

I recently sat in on a discussion with Jen-Hsun Huang (NVIDIA Founder/CEO) where he placed very substantial emphasis on the threats of ""good enough.""  Coming from the chip business, he's got a point.<p>From brain surgery to semiconductors, it sounds like the importance of ""good enough"" is relatively context-sensitive.",1176582364

You want to get a place on the red line [the local subway] because then you can go see people and people can go see you. The best place to go is Davis Square, because its cheap, fun, and on the red line. Harvard is fun and on the red line but not cheap, Porter is cheap and on the red line but not fun, so I recommend Davis, Inman, and Central, in that order. Underneath the table I sneak my notebook and pencil out of my pocket and begin secretly taking notes.</i><p><i>Now the thing you want to get is one of these triple-decker houses converted into apartments, where the top floor is slightly smaller than the other two. And then youll be in exactly the same place as VisiCalc when they started it  in the top floor of a triple-decker in Davis Square. (Actually, Paul later told me VisiCalc was started in the neighboring town of Arlington.) Yeah, but you dont want to code like VisiCalc, Trevor says, that stuff was rotten. Well, it made money, didnt it? Paul replies.</i>",1176581708

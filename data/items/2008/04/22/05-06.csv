170322,comment,170080,170302,0,0,jsjenkins168,,,"With SimpleDB, you can still accomplish many-to-one and even one-to-many. So in your example schema you described, you could have an attribute (aka column) in your tags domain (aka table) which holds the ids of the article items (aka rows) in your article domain that the tag is associated with. Since your data is denormalized though, you will have many duplicate items if a tag applies to many different articles. Thats ok though, SimpleDB was designed for this dont worry about large domains.<p>So this is how you could get your many-to-one mapping. To determine what articles have tag foo, you would just do the equivalent of select from tags where your attribute value matches the item id for the desired article.<p>It seems unintuitive, but you can actually do one-to-many mappings too with SimpleDB. So you could say ""show me all the tags for article A"" without a join table or duplicate items. The reason this is possible is because SimpleDB can attach up to 256 values to a single attribute. This obviously isnt possible in SQL. You just assign references to each tag id for that article to one attribute. Kinda like putting a list of Strings in a single cell in SQL. Be very careful with this though, as you cannot exceed 256 values bound to 1 attribute. So no more than 256 tags per article in your example.<p>But the problem with all this is keeping track of changes. updates and deletes do not cascade so you have to handle that yourself. And of course you have to consider eventual consistency if making frequent changes on top of each other.<p>My suggestion to help reduce the complexity of managing your domain references is to use this library (if you are using Java that is). It makes SimpleDB so much more usable: <a href=""http://code.google.com/p/simplejpa/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://code.google.com/p/simplejpa/</a>",1208843004

I guess luck is timing to some degree - but its also plain luck.  All of the monday morning quarterbacking that goes on seems obvious in retrospect, but the future is still completely uncertain. VC's expect 1 in 10 to fail b/c thats just historically what has happened.  If they knew what made the 1 hit they wouldn't fund the 9 losers.  I'm just saying, really nothing new I guess, that the business of predicting the future by looking at the past is colored by confirmation bias.  What characteristic do all self made men have in common?  They took alot of risk.  However, thats also the same trait incarcerated bank-robbers have in common.  I'm just saying prediction is impossible.<p>By all means do what you love b/c if it crashes and burns at least you won't have hated the last 2 years of your life.",1208841313

170308,comment,169295,169295,0,0,dataangel,,,"The best method for you probably varies based on _why_ you're socially inept. If it's because you haven't interacted enough with other people, then the advice others have given to get more experience makes sense. If it's because you're under confident or constantly worried about things the other person is thinking, you should work at getting rid of your insecurities.<p>The right course of action will then depend on the insecurity, but exercise and improved health generally boosted my confidence. If you experience anxiety over others judging you, consider that in most situations the person you're worried about probably isn't paying much attention to you, and even if they do notice you do something odd, they won't necessarily remember it; everything only revolves around you in _your_ head. Most of all, just get off your butt and do something about whatever bothers you -- if you're embarrassed by your long hair, get a haircut. A surprising number of my own insecurities were things like that -- easily fixable if I only took the time to calm down, consider them, and make a list of solutions.",1208841081

170302,comment,170080,170248,0,0,jrockway,,,"I would be interested in hearing more about your migration from MySQL to SimpleDB.<p>Basically, I am a big fan of normalization (since none of the other ways seem elegant to me).  For example, if I were going to write the schema for a Blog, I would have an articles table, a tags table, and an article<->tag mapping table.  This means that ""show me articles with tag foo"" is indexed (and ""faster"" than an O(n) search over the articles table).<p>The only approach I can see with SimpleDB is to tolerate scanning all articles to search tags (and authors, etc.) or to maintain a separate ""document"" for each tag (that links to the articles with the tag).  Then I worry about concurrent updates to a tag ( {foo:[1,2]} gets updated to {foo:[1,2,3]} while someone else immediately changes it to {foo:[1,2,4]}; the correct result would be {foo:[1,2,3,4]} but adding 4 overwrites adding 3.)<p>Anyway, like I said, I would be interested in hearing people's experiences.  Perhaps I am missing something obvious.",1208840574

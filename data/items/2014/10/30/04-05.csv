My path is not the same as yours, but I ran into rejection applying to college, applying to grad school, and applying to jobs after grad school.<p>In each case I felt terrible. I didn&#x27;t know how to move forwards or what I was going to do, I felt like the rejection was an indictment of my self-worth.<p>But I think it helps to keep three things in mind:<p>- The people on the other side of these interviews are humans - they make mistakes and work off incomplete data. I guarantee you that they know far less about who you are, personally or professionally, than any of your friends or loved ones.<p>- Your self worth isn&#x27;t tied to how well you do during an interview, or how many job offers you get, or whether or not your dream company gives you a job.<p>- Your destination - if you don&#x27;t give up, you will probably end up where you wanted to go. But almost certainly, you won&#x27;t have taken the path you originally set out to take. Life is filled with unforeseen setbacks and unanticipated opportunities. Proceed with an open mind and don&#x27;t feel like you need to have everything figured out right away.",1414645156

As Marshall McLuhan observed, “We shape our tools and thereafter our tools shape us.” The spreadsheet is a tool, and it is also a world view — reality by the numbers. If the perceptions of those who play a large part in shaping our world are shaped by spreadsheets, it is important that all of us understand what this tool can and cannot do.</i><p>Steve Sinofsky (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steven_Sinofsky"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steven_Sinofsky</a>) made  a similar point on HN yesterday:<p><i>Second, people tend to underestimate the way that new tools, as ineffective as they are, drive changes in the very definition of work. Said another way, people forget that tools can also define the work and jobs people have. It isn&#x27;t like work was always &quot;mail around a 10MB presentation before the meeting&quot;. In fact a long time ago meeting agendas were typed out in courier by a typist -- that job was defined by the Selectric. The tools that created presentations, attachments, and follow up email defined a style of working. While we&#x27;re reading all this, the exponential rise of mobile is changing what it means to work--to go to a meeting, to collaborate, to decide, to create, etc.</i><p><a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=8525444"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=8525444</a>",1414645070

Once upon a time were these magical devices called &quot;mainframes&quot; [1], and in the 1960s they were quite powerful (for that era).<p>Most engineering work was done in FORTRAN, and it ran very efficiently on the hardware. There were (usually) no CPU cycle sucking GUIs to slow down the computers.<p>As a high school student in the early 1970s I was privileged to take a summer course at the Goddard Institute for Space Studies [2] where they had an IBM 360/95 mainframe [3] for the scientists to take turns using (job entry by punched cards, job output by paper printout).<p>It&#x27;s been so many years, and it was only casually explained to me, but I think NASA used three other 360/95 mainframes (the IBM top of the line at the time) located at the Goddard Space Flight Center [4] in Greenbelt MD to track the Apollo missions. I think these ran the same program more-or-less in triplicate (but there was no hardware for syncing). I think NASA also had an IBM 7094 [5] running an independently written program as a backup in case something went wrong with the S/360 computers.<p>Trust me, these computers were very very capable for the time. It&#x27;s not like the primitive computer onboard the Apollo LEM.

8531458,comment,8531140,8531140,0,0,plesner,,,"Getting a good sense of a person is really difficult, especially through something as contrived as these technical interviews. And any company that sees enough applicants that they can afford it will err on the side of rejecting candidates even if they know they&#x27;re probably good, if for whatever reason they&#x27;re not quite sure. I&#x27;ve interviewed people that blew me away and then seen them rejected. I don&#x27;t intend that as a criticism really because I can&#x27;t imagine a hiring process, however well meaning, that doesn&#x27;t have this issue to some extent. It&#x27;s just how these things work.<p>When you don&#x27;t get hired though, almost always you will err on the side of blaming yourself. I&#x27;ve heard about people blaming the process but I&#x27;ve never met someone in person who did that. And actually I suspect there&#x27;s a Dunning–Kruger effect working where the more qualified you are the more likely you are to turn a rejection inwards and blame yourself.<p>I&#x27;m not saying that&#x27;s what happened here, I don&#x27;t know. Just keep in mind that hiring anywhere, including at amazon and google, can&#x27;t be a fair process to the candidate.

And I don&#x27;t think there is that large of an audience that is willing to spend that much for style + functionality -- if they want to spend that much, they likely care more about style, and will stick to a traditional watch.<p>So if gadget = functionality, then I say &quot;Finally.

There are so many firms out there chasing the same business - from your top-tier Madison avenue firms who have gone digital, to your 3 person, 1 hit-wonder shop in DUMBO - that clients have these companies strapped tightly over a very large barrel. Companies are bending over backwards with just about everything: allowing late payments, cut-rate deals, and sometimes even free work for even moderately complicated jobs (in the hopes that if they properly prostrate themselves, they will be given <i>paying</i> work in the future), which really hurts bottom lines - and the ability to offer competitive salaries.<p>I&#x27;m also seeing the same talent flight as the author of the piece, not just with designers, but also devs and good producers/project managers.

9049641,comment,9049186,9049616,0,0,engendered,,,"I&#x27;ll be the devil&#x27;s advocate and say that a lot of software development is not particularly novel. A lot of software development is essentially doing minor changes to existing systems, in the same way and format as everything existing, with nothing novel or particularly challenging.<p>If you&#x27;re asked to add a couple of fields on a CRM form that you&#x27;ve worked on for years, being able to estimate how long changing the storage, data, business and presentation logic should be expected and easy, with high accuracy and very little to no risk. Or maybe you&#x27;re making yet another minor derivative of a data import task that&#x27;s slightly different from the hundreds you did before. This is often why businesses demand very specific skillsets, because while I would have no idea how long a Wordpress integration module would take, I would bet that someone who works with it a lot would.<p>There are a lot of software developers who, when given such a task, will try to make it more challenging by rebuilding everything in the process, then throwing up their hands about the complexity involved. It&#x27;s understandable why business partners get upset about this.<p>There is absolutely inventive software development, but we don&#x27;t make a credible case when we lump it all in together.",1423922354

9049635,comment,9049208,9049208,0,0,Arun2009,,,"I can relate to this. A friend once described me as a vector with infinite magnitude and randomly changing direction. At various points in life I have occupied myself with studying everything from Biology and functional programming to Indian Philosophy and Sanskrit. But I never stick to any one project for long. A few months into my study program, I shift to the next shiny thing that catches my attention.<p>There is a saving grace though: the set of things that I&#x27;m interested in remains constant, so that I am not endlessly moving into newer and newer areas, but cycling between a fixed set of subjects. Right now I have come back to functional programming and doing courses from Coursera. I am at the moment quite determined to see this through, but knowing myself as well as I do, I fully expect to jump to something else in a couple of month&#x27;s time.<p>My current strategy to tackle this syndrome is as follows:<p>* Accept that you are interested in multiple subjects and that you may never be a world-class expert in any of them. However, you can be a competent generalist who has sufficient familiarity with a bunch of fields and this can be valuable. It&#x27;s also a probably more interesting way to lead your life than specializing in one field.<p>* Keep a journal of your learning activities so that you can learn more about yourself over time. I have been writing every day since 2010 and its fascinating when I look back at what I was doing this time of the year a few years back.<p>* When you start a study project, focus on short sprints instead of the long marathon. Try to accumulate concrete achievements and most importantly, aim for a closure to your sprint. For example, if you start a book, declare victory once you have studied 80% of the chapters. If you start on a Mathematical topic, upload your notes and problems you solve somewhere where you can look them up later, and declare your sprint complete once you have dome some 100-120 non-routine problems.<p>* Realize that your effort is not completely wasted. I first flirted with Haskell in November 2012 but later dropped it and moved on to something else. The next time I took up Haskell again was about a year later in November 2013. I had forgotten most of what I had learned, BUT the second time it was much, much easier to cover the same ground again and I went further in my learning that time. Ditto for Sanskrit. I first tried to learn Sanskrit in August 2013, but later dropped out of my study program. The next time I took it up was in June 2014, and I stuck with it long enough to complete the first part of a correspondence course - a concrete achievement!<p>I am still struggling with the random-vector syndrome, but I am much better at coping with it. I &quot;know&quot; that the solution is to focus on just one thing, but that strikes me as a supremely uninteresting way to lead my life.",1423922240

If you&#x27;re using Firefox Nightly, you can simply visit about:config and change the shumway.swf.whitelist setting to &quot;*&quot;. Note that you still need to have the Flash plugin installed for most sites to work, as I explained in another comment a few minutes ago.<p>Regarding the table of supported APIs: the problem with that is that we actually have most APIs implemented, but have compatibility bugs in some of them which break content. If we could easily list the broken APIs, then in most cases we could just as easily fix them. That said, there are some major API areas we don&#x27;t yet support. Those are mostly related to newer and thus less-used capabilities, such as Flash&#x27;s version of WebGL, called Stage3D, and a new text layout system called Text Layout Engine.",1423921900

9049616,comment,9049186,9049517,0,0,Tekhne,,,"This analogy is flawed, and I think represents the exact problem developers experience with non-developers. There&#x27;s an underlying assumption that we know what walking or a taxi are. We don&#x27;t. In this analogy, developers would need to invent both before giving an accurate estimate. The methods of transport are the mechanism for delivering the result of arriving at the desired destination. Software development projects are also about creating the mechanism for arriving at a result. The software is bespoke almost by definition, or you could go buy it off the shelf. Bespoke software is unknown. It&#x27;s invention. We may be able to apply past experience inventing similar things to our estimations, but there is always some amount of uncertainty. Sometimes there is a lot because we&#x27;ve never built anything like the thing requested. We often may not even understand what is being asked for.

9049613,comment,9042891,9043875,0,0,tschneidereit,,,"I think letting the browser do this kind of caching for you is best in most cases. Developers have used tricks to force browsers to layerize content for many years, and browsers have become better at that over time. Nowadays, it should be fairly simple to isolate complex but unchanging content into its own layer that&#x27;s cached and composited with the rest of the page instead of being rerendered for each page update.<p>In Shumway, we do almost all rendering in a Canvas element, so we haven&#x27;t experimented all that much with DOM-heavy constructs.<p>As for your last question: I used to work with AS3 on a daily basis in a previous work-life, so I have extensive experience with it. Yes, there are some parts of the language that&#x27;re very nice. I think that optional static typing is the best of all worlds, for example. The details of AS3&#x27;s type system leave much to be desired, but the IDE support gained through static typing and the large set of bugs that&#x27;re far easier to avoid are easily worth it.<p>Also, declarative classes are, in my opinion much easier to deal with than, e.g., the unstructured alternatives in JS. That&#x27;s part of why we moved to TypeScript, and I&#x27;d argue that it vastly improved the quality of our codebase. I&#x27;m <i>very</i> much looking forward to classes in ES6.<p>Of course there are things that I don&#x27;t miss about AS3 and regret having to deal with in Shumway.

When you&#x27;re motivated, things tend to fall into place.<p>That&#x27;s not an indictment of you. Contrary to popular belief, motivation doesn&#x27;t much come from within. For almost everybody, long-term motivation is about other people: your friends, your community, and the world at large. You&#x27;ll be motivated to do something when these groups of people push you to.<p>And the mechanism for that push is almost always the same: <i>status</i>. In the long term, human beings find it very easy to do things that increase their status, and very difficult to do anything else (except for things that are inherently more pleasurable than difficult — but that generally doesn&#x27;t include studying CS theory).<p>This is really hard on college students, because even though good grades will increase your status after college, they rarely do much for your status <i>in</i> college. If you&#x27;re good, professors <i>might</i> care, but the collective student body won&#x27;t.<p>The solution is to find people who really care about your performance in your field of study — maybe a professor&#x27;s lab, maybe a group of high achievers, maybe (ideally) a club with an external goal (e.g. autonomous vehicle club) — and make those people central to your life by spending a lot of time with them. If you do, it&#x27;ll become natural for you to work hard at your field. Although still, you&#x27;ll only be driven to do things that directly increase your status in your group.<p>And of course, this solution can be hard to implement; spending lots of time with a new group of people takes its own motivation. It gets a lot easier after college, though. After college you get a job, and wherever you work, <i>everybody</i> will care about how you perform.",1423918894

Self-driving will only work when conditions are normal. Incompatible weather conditions? Broken sensor? The car parks itself, and you need to drive yourself or wait for assistance.</i><p>That would be a good solution, but many people who talk about self-driving cars don&#x27;t want that. They want to sleep in the car. They want to &quot;drive&quot; home drunk. In both cases, a manual override would be disastrous and probably illegal. (We can already get a DUI just for <i>getting</i> into a car while drunk!) They also want to be able to &quot;fetch&quot; their cars without a driver, which wouldn&#x27;t work.",1423918810

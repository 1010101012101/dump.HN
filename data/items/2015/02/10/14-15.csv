This is a solvable problem.  More serious effort needs to be made to slow and reverse aging, rather than this resigned march to death that your downvoters exhibit.  The human potential that is lost to aging is staggering.<p>It is fashionable to show how sophisticated and intelligent you are, to discount or even deride people who have the goal of extending human lifespan.  That&#x27;s too bad.",1423580396

9027446,comment,9026730,9027246,0,0,jerf,,,"That&#x27;s true, but my recommendation to newer programmers is still learn to practice radical DRY first, then as the final polish, learn when to back off (i.e., &quot;the rule of three&quot;). Far, <i>far</i> more programmers do not understand DRY, and <i>accidentally</i> avoid over-sharing by virtue of simply having bad coding practices in general and rewriting everything every time than overdo DRY.<p>Someday I ought to write up a post about this sort of thing on my blog. I think part of our eternal warfare about coding practices (though by no means all of it) comes from the fact that there are different practices that should be followed by someone with two years of experience than someone with ten. For instance, I think test-driven development is <i>great</i>... for a new programmer. It is something that you will outgrow eventually. But in the meantime, TDD will teach you good design much more quickly than you would have learned any other way, and in the meantime, you&#x27;ll produce better code than you would have otherwise just blundering around in the traditional manner. And for myself at coming up fast on 20 years of experience, I don&#x27;t do &quot;TDD&quot; but I still do a lot of automated testing (and the damned code keeps surprising me, and punishing me whenever I think <i>this time for sure</i> I can skip the tests...).<p>So too here with DRY; you may someday outgrow it, but you&#x27;ll learn better design and programming skills in the meantime, and in the end I still think you&#x27;ll find the optimum point is closer to DRY than farther from it. I think that&#x27;s because beyond the surface gloss of DRY from a perspective of simply &quot;not repeating code&quot; you come to understand how a bit of code can <i>embody a concept</i>, and what DRY is really trying to teach you to avoid is having a concept live in two places, rather than raw code repetition, and <i>that</i> idea will stick with you until the end of your career. But to get to that level of understanding, practice radical DRY until you understand.",1423580369
9027445,comment,9027180,9027180,0,0,zanny,,,"So this was a discussion in /r/linux last week about LLVM and GCC et al, so I&#x27;m just reposting my statements on why a world where GCC is irrelevant is bad:<p>It takes little effort on Apples or Googles or Microsofts part to take advantage of an LLVM dominated world to close off their own changes to it and try to force developers to use their own proprietary LLVM distributions on their own operating systems. It stops every other company in the future from taking advantage of all the great LLVM tech to implement their own CPUs in terms of LLVM IR, so they never need to publish their ISA and they can lock down their platform with a blob LLVM of their own. The only thing stopping any of that from happening is GCC being a still competitive alternative.<p>If LLVM came to dominate the compiler scene to such a degree that GCC were irrelevant, it opens the flood gates to any major company forking LLVM into a proprietary paid for compiler that they require on their OS to profit from. It lets you do anything from what Apple is already doing with Swift, where you create a programming language with a proprietary compiler, or you could go from the other end and implement a proprietary translation unit so that you never need to publish your ISA (something Nvidia never does) but that allows all the LLVM compilers to target it.<p>Right now, nobody can close off their LLVM contributions because a hobbled and fractured LLVM ecosystem is one that cannot overcome GCC. In the same way Apple and Google had to cooperate on webkit until it was so dominate they were in a position to fork and do their own things with it once Gecko was rendered effectively irrelevant, but the difference is that webkit was LGPL and Clang is its own permissive license - they still cannot directly modify the free software parts without redistribution, so it is harder to make a proprietary webkit, but Apple surely has succeeded since they have their own proprietary patchset on top of trunk webkit nowadays.",1423580346

It provides an easy abstraction, and that requires the kernel do a lot of messy stuff for you:<p>- When you&#x27;re using TCP sockets, the kernel makes copies of everything your application writes and holds it in a buffer until its receipt is acknowledged, just in case it needs to resend it when the other side doesn&#x27;t acknowledge it. If the socket&#x27;s buffer fills up, your application blocks on I/O until some space is freed.<p>- It holds ports open in a lingering state long after they&#x27;re closed just in case it needs to re-transmit the last bytes. This can be disabled, but it&#x27;s on by default.<p>- It takes care of all the congestion control for you, but it&#x27;s tuned for the general case, and as a result there are a lot of edge cases which perform very badly for the problem they&#x27;re trying to solve. Redis is probably one such edge case.<p>Of course, all of this is fine and desirable for general applications, but it ends up being problematic if you&#x27;re trying to solve a problem where performance is the chief concern.<p>It&#x27;s tempting to say the problem is that kernel has to do way too much to provide that easy abstraction, but really the problem is that the kernel provides no way around it. You pretty much have the option of using their cushy stream abstraction at the cost of performance, or you use a userspace TCP stack on raw sockets, which requires running as root and disabling TCP in the kernel (otherwise the kernel stomps all over your TCP negotiations[1]).<p>There are some other transport layer protocols (SCTP, DCCP, etc.), as well as application layer protocols built on UDP, that remove some of the abstractions TCP provides and as a result require less in-kernel bureaucracy, but those solutions don&#x27;t seem to be very popular or well-supported.<p>It would be nice if the kernel would provide some lower level system calls that could be selectively used to move parts of TCP into the application (e.g., retaining copies of data in case of re-transmission).

Before that I had extensively tried OkCupid, I went on a fair few dates, but to be honest most of the people I met were weirdos... I also tried some of the early location based apps, but even in central London people were few and far between.<p>The problem with sites like OkCupid is people are desperately looking for someone who they have that deep connection with. As your profile gives out so much information, you really dig into the personality of a potential match to see whether they check all the boxes - and in almost all cases they won&#x27;t. Rather than risking going on a date, they just skip past and wonder how many cats they should buy. If I came across my fiancé on a dating site, I would of no doubt thought &quot;meh&quot;, but here we are nearly 4 years later living together in another continent.<p>I think Tinder has a lot more potential. Rather than chatting for weeks before meeting someone, you can be a lot more spontaneous by just matching then meeting up for a date.

Someone needs to do dangerous, nasty, repetitive jobs if we want to maintain a standard of living that many people have become used to. Creatures with the sort of agency you&#x27;re describing are, in my opinion, unsuited to those tasks, for several reasons, including moral and economic reasons. The robots we are increasingly using to do those jobs are much better suited, and there isn&#x27;t (again, in my opinion) a moral objection that solely applies to such machines.<p>That said, our policies are woefully out of date in the face of such increasing automation. Our current system inflates employment and even a meager standard of living. We are going to need to revise our polices, both in the more developed nations and in those that have, as you so tastefully put it, &quot;different labor standards&quot;. I don&#x27;t know how to do this. There are many proposals; a popular one is the basic income guarantee. I&#x27;m not educated or intelligent enough to really understand the implications of such a policy, but I can agree that the just and humane treatment of all creatures with the agency you&#x27;re talking about is among the best guiding principles that I can think of.<p>The two issues raised above (whether it is moral to use a machine for automation, and the fair treatment of creatures with agency) is separate from the point related to the development of human-manufactured creatures with agency. We don&#x27;t know how to do it yet, but we are slowly working towards it. Assuming that we eventually do figure it out, that will be a victory as long as we treat our new children like we would treat our homo sapiens children. The research and development of such creatures with agency and those for industrial automation are not mutually exclusive, and serve different purposes.<p>To try to put it a different way: something is going to need to harvest fruit.

The first truck to unload its four legged robotic soldiers loses 30 units to the welcome party, a quarter. By the time the tenth one is unloading, they&#x27;re not losing any. The last robo-dog is unloaded just 18 minutes after the first truck arrives. By that time, there are over 10,000 dogs in squad-packs seeking targets from a database of 7,000 known enemy combatants and seeking control of strategically important sites.<p>there&#x27;s something uncanny and creepy about how robots move once they&#x27;ve been riddled with armor piercing rounds.

No question that a native gui is faster, more performant and more faithfull to the plateform you&#x27;re actually developping on. I fail to see how one cannot acheive the full potential of native applications with js backed native gui.<p>There is no translation or compilation whatsoever,the javascript you write with Titanium is the javascript that will be running in the app,so there is no js-to-native, as js isn&#x27;t compiled to objectiveC or Java. The cleverness of Titanium and co is to expose the native GUI as Phonegap expose native apis of the phone. Nothing prevents you from writing Titanium plugins like one is writing Phonegap plugin when the framework doesn&#x27;t support this or that feature.<p>On the top of that Titanium exposes webviews if one really needs them. All the app doesn&#x27;t have to be html and css. Menus,prompts,alerts and navigation can and should be native, something you can&#x27;t do directly with phonegap and likes.<p>With projects like Titanium,there is very little reason to go back to shells like Phonegap that solve very little. For instance, I want my app to feel native but somehow one screen has to display a 3d model and I know webgl and it runs on my phone?<p>well i&#x27;ll write most of my app with titanium and i&#x27;ll just use the web tech I like ONLY when it is necessary. How isn&#x27;t it using both techs(native and web) to their full potential? Furthermore I get to use all the js libs I like,such as Backbone or Underscore,or Momentjs or Q...<p>So AGAIN,since Titanium exposes a webview anyway,there is no need for things like Phonegap anymore. We need,however,more solutions with Titanium approach.And If you want to use a webview,well,there it is.",1423579041

But I&#x27;ve had stints where my main job was to fix bugs and/or add features to an existing code base, and I don&#x27;t consider it &quot;easier&quot; than designing and developing a greenfield project.  In fact, I consider it considerably more difficult.<p>To fix a bug you typically have to 1) figure out someone else&#x27;s build and probably partially documented dependencies, 2) adapt to someone else&#x27;s programming style and conventions, 3) figure out what the feature was supposed to do without the benefit of the business context in which it was created, 4) figure out how that feature was implemented in code, and then 5) not just get into the mindset of the programmer who wrote it, but keep enough distance from that mindset to find the flaw.<p>In short, I consider &quot;bug fixing&quot; on a new and unfamiliar code base to be a pretty substantial mental challenge.<p>I wish the industry gave more credit to what you&#x27;ve been doing.  I have found that open source communities do give a great deal of credit to people who can get up to speed quickly with a code base and do things like improve testing coverage, fixing bugs, or improving documentation.<p>That said, have you tried creating a side project?  Probably the best thing to do would be to think of some software you think would be interesting, and try writing it.  Pick a relatively new stack, and create a web app, or mobile app, or something that you think would be useful.  I know, this is a lot of extra work on top of an existing job.

But, after talking with FB folks I came away very happy. I think they will complement and gain from each other immensely.<p>A few notes on Native vs Hybrid:<p>1. Facebook is a big company with complex apps. They care very much about speed in their experience and can afford three development teams.<p>2. You can use Reapp today on all platforms, including web.  Native is still unreleased. Outside of Facebook no once can use it, and it hasn&#x27;t shipped any code for Android.<p>3. Native will feed back into hybrid well! They told me they wrote a much nicer touch library for it that could be ported back to JS, which I&#x27;m excited to do.<p>4. The dev experience with Reapp is still ahead big time. One codebase, hot reloading of components, and lots more, but you really can go from 0 to app in less time than any other way in my opinion.<p>In fact I think Reapp is a great way to get into React in general.

With React Native (AFAIK) and Appcelerator, you get some of the benefit of both approaches but nowhere near the full potential of either.<p>Everything is hidden behind a thick layer of abstraction and you have to trust that things will be wired up properly on the other side of the fence and continue to be wired up properly as native UI components and APIs evolve.

That was always a possibility with unstable of course, but usually fixing it was quite simple.\nIn this situation it was worse because you first had to find where the problem lies, which means understanding all the complex interactions of a desktop&#x27;s components.\nSearching for documentation isn&#x27;t very easy either, because sometimes there is no documentation except the source code and configuration files themselves.\nFxing things isn&#x27;t easy as downgrading or fixing a configuration file either: usually you have to patch the applications, or wait for others to do it.<p>All this is made worse that systemd tries to do too many things at once: PID1/service supervision, initscripts, dbus stuff for logind, policykit/pam, syslog etc.\nSome people have strong opinions on PID1 and initscripts\n(myself included) and don&#x27;t like all these forcibly changed at once.<p>I wouldn&#x27;t be opposed to service supervision (I like runit),\nor a better initscript format, but I&#x27;d like to have a choice of changing that without breaking unrelated things (like policykit on the desktop).\nOTOH I don&#x27;t really care how consolekit/policykit/dbus is implemented as long as it works, and as long as I&#x27;m not forced to change something unrelated, like how I boot my system.<p>Also if these were all independent applications that didn&#x27;t require the rest of systemd troubleshooting would be easier by switching out components one at a time.

Ever thought about your breathing?  Tones are a bit like that.  Just don&#x27;t think about them, let the sentence flow.<p>Characters are the killer.  Not hard, but slow and tedious.  2 per day... 5 per day... 10 per day... cram and 100 per day... but they&#x27;re lost without constant reinforcement.<p>Then the thorn you were trying to ignore comes back, and idiomatic sentences (chengyu, based on 4 characters, &#x27;long time no see&#x27; being of the form, or &#x27;people mountain people sea&#x27; a super simple one) based on cultural or historical references come back, kick you to the curb again.  Much as English idioms do.<p>And then speaking formally... different ball game.  Pomp and circumstance rule.<p>But informal spoken Chinese is surprisingly easy to attain.  Just get the accent down.",1423577310

Gell-Mann was pointing out that no one else on earth (even himself, a Noble prize winner) could work the way Feynman did, the joke being that he only needed three steps: (1) Write down the problem. (2) Think real hard. (3) Write down the solution.  It was about the absurd brilliance of Feynman, not intended as any sort of useful model to follow.",1423577296

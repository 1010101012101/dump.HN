You can&#x27;t become better by taking a drug, but they&#x27;re not talking about bettering themselves. They&#x27;re talking about healing. If your intention is to better yourself with the aid of psychedelic drugs[1], you&#x27;ll only get out what you put in, and psychedelics will mostly only inspire you to put forth the effort. edit: You still have to work at improving yourself through other means.<p>> For each individual who says psychedelics have made them a better person, there are hundreds who make the same claim about religion.<p>Well, not that many people are willing to try psychedelics.<p>> And I think we can all agree that the risk of biological side effects is much lower with religion.<p>Every year more people are killed in the name of religion than by psychedelics. Psychedelics kill noone. Their LD50 is usually too high.<p>> If I were going to follow your advice and try MDMA, shouldn&#x27;t I follow my father&#x27;s advice and try religion first?<p>Sure, but please try more than one religion, and check out philosophy too. You can choose whether or not to try MDMA in the same way that you can choose whether or not to go sky diving.<p>[1] This is not an inherently misguided idea, but in uncontrolled environments, psychedelics can be quite dangerous.",1411368898

We exist in a world that has benefited greatly from and been transformed by a more &quot;enlightened&quot; world view (one that is accepting and embraces scientific principles), but at the same time it largely rejects that world view, with abundant evidence everywhere.<p>We think we are sophisticated and advanced but there&#x27;s only a skim of sophostication on top of our primitivism. Look at our criminal justice system, which makes a mockery of justice, perverts society, and embraces medieval ideas about punishment, retribution, and suffering. You see similar things everywhere you look. The idea of rule of law, then the subversion of law with favoritism for the powerful. And so on. We don&#x27;t notice much of this because we see the good, which to be fair is important and nevertheless real, and ignore the bad because it has become familiar (or worse, it is familiar but we dismiss it as being exceptional, like sexual violence or police corruption).",1411368411

When the player changes tile, it resets.<p>This results in a relatively small per frame cost, with a constant worst case (for a 21x21 tile grid, it would be at most 80 tiles processed in one frame, i.e. 21x4 - 4, the number of tiles in the outside border).<p>As outlined above, this is exactly what you want in a game, because it makes the sharp edge cases you&#x27;re describing impossible. Throw a hundred enemies in there in a pathological maze environment, moving the player around continuously, breaking walls, and it (the pathfinding aspect) will run just fine.<p>Try to do that with A* in the browser, and my crystal ball predicts the addition of a well worn copy of Web Workers for Dummies on a book shelf near you :)<p>One gotcha is that if you don&#x27;t stop moving, half of the screen that&#x27;s too far away from the player will not be updated, but enemies in those squares just use the out of date information.

8349500,comment,8349006,8349401,8,0,RickHull,,,"I completely agree with your assessment of Kerr, and there is nothing wrong with purely legal analysis.<p>What got to me initially was the deliberate limiting of legal scope to warranted privacy violations, as though warrantless privacy violations are insignificant.  He&#x27;s welcome to do so, but he should be clearer about this and less rhetorically dedicated to his agenda.<p><i>EDIT: I see now that he reasons this technology only affects warranted privacy violations, since Apple has a policy of refusing unwarranted inquiries.  He is overlooking the possibility that Apple may nonetheless be pressured, deceived, or compelled to violate users&#x27; privacy.  He doesn&#x27;t realize that Apple&#x27;s claim of being invulnerable to warrants also protects the user from Apple&#x27;s own vulnerabilities.  It&#x27;s not just USA law enforcement that targets users by exploiting Apple&#x27;s access to protected data.</i><p>My understanding is that warrantless privacy violations have grown tremendously since the Patriot Act, both in scope and quantity -- that we have many new laws or codes since then which reclassify previously warrantful privacy violations as now warrantless.<p>He asks &quot;How is the public interest served by a policy that only thwarts lawful search warrants?&quot;<p>This is a nasty rhetorical trick.  Does Apple&#x27;s policy change serve any other purpose than to thwart lawful search warrants?  Kerr puts &quot;no&quot; in your head, but of course the answer is yes.<p>He then makes appeal to the &quot;civil libertarian tradition&quot; of protection from warrants, saying that Apple is thumbing its nose at &quot;that great tradition&quot;.  What a joke.  Apple is selling a product with powerful capabilities, some of which can be used to break the law, all of which have legitimate lawful purposes.  Are Ford, Boeing, Delta, Budweiser, Louisville Slugger, Smith & Wesson all playing dangerous games as well?<p>Lastly, this is about removing Apple&#x27;s ability to unlock. Just like Colin Percival&#x27;s tarsnap.  Doing proper security via proper cryptography.  Minimizing untrusted third parties.

He provided the musical philosophy behind the design of Don Buchla&#x27;s eponymous electronic sound platform [2]. Mort is responsible for the Buchla&#x27;s lack of a familiar 12-key per octave keyboard. Mort felt that as long as they were synthesizing sound from scratch, there was no reason to box themselves into traditional scales, which result from the harmonic nature of sounds produced by resonant instruments (like winds and strings).<p>By contrast, Bob Moog created a synthesizer that is very much within the tradition of classical music. I imagine that this continuity, exemplified by Switched On Bach, is probably why the Moog is the far more famous instrument today. It&#x27;s a much easier on ramp for musicians used to traditional instruments.<p>[1] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silver_Apples_of_the_Moon"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silver_Apples_of_the_Moon</a>.<p>[2] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buchla_Electronic_Musical_Instruments"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buchla_Electronic_Musical_Inst...</a>",1411367068

It stops the government from being able to access the phone precisely when it has a lawful warrant signed by a judge.<p>When the government has a warrant, the person being called into question is being served the warrant.  The way it works now, the Government just bypasses the person and forces the carrier/handset manufacturer to give up information.  This step is just brining the law back in line with how it was traditionally instated and enforced.  That&#x27;s like the Government going to Audi for a backdoor key to unlock my car while I&#x27;m not there so they can search it.",1411366916

If we accept that as the only criteria, then sure the proposition stands, but then it loses meaning and becomes nothing more than a rhetorical device.<p>There is nothing circular about it. There is no requirement to exclude other evidence. Regardless of what other evidence exists, discovering that there is a very high approval rate makes it more likely that warrants are approved uncritically than it was before the approval rate was known.<p>> Assuming the standard isn&#x27;t changing, we would expect an equilibrium to emerge where the parties involved would come to understand the standard, especially given that the warrant process is not adversarial. So there&#x27;s no reason not to expect the approval rate to settle at close to 100%, with the few denials being law enforcement attempts to skirt the boundaries.<p>The fact that the process is not adversarial only makes it more likely that judges are approving warrants they shouldn&#x27;t be. Moreover, prosecutors have every incentive to try to &quot;skirt the boundaries&quot; as often as possible, unless the boundaries are so broad they don&#x27;t need to be skirted.<p>> Anything less than a very high rate would indicate that the standards are inconsistent or are being inconsistently applied.<p>Or that prosecutors are continually testing the fences as they have every incentive to do.",1411366743

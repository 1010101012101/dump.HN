7593944,comment,7591771,7592448,4,0,dredmorbius,,,"Fitness activities are goal-dependent.  There is no one &quot;best&quot; exercise, and generally a balance of training methods is used to achieve specific goals.<p>There are different modalities to exercise.  Many of them are complimentary.  All of them hit a rate of diminishing returns in finite time.<p>What you do (how you train / what your fitness routine is) depends on your goals and needs.<p>Generally, there are:<p>• Short-term energy systems training:  high-intensity cardio.  Characterized by high-intensity intervals, Tabata, fartlek, or similar training protocols.  A Tabata workout runs 4 minutes.<p>• Long-term endurance energy systems training:  this can help train the body to more efficiently mobilize fat stores.  It&#x27;s what many people think of as &quot;exercise&quot;:  long, slow, steady-state activities such as walking, cycling, etc.<p>• Strength training:  high-level resistance training to near failure in the 1-20 reps range, generally.  This contains within it additional modalities:  strength, hypertrophy, endurance, isolation, compound, plyometrics, speed / Olympic lifts, etc.  Also involves progression, periodization, and micro / meso / megacycle training variation.<p>• Prioreception / fine motor control:  not entirely the same thing, but essentially training your coordination and skills.  This could be gymnastics moves involving strength and balance, pitching or tennis accuracy, or fine motor control utilized by musicians.<p>• Mobility work:  much of the asana practice of yoga delves into this, but myofascial release (self-induced or received massage), heat and cold therapy, etc., play into this.<p>• Relaxation, meditation, mindfulness, visualization:  different aspects of relaxation, many involving stilling the inner voice.  The meditative practice of yoga is an embodiment of this.<p>• Rest and recovery.  Anyone training hard becomes a sleep whore.  An eight hour minimum, and often sleep binges of 10-12 hours, aren&#x27;t uncommon for athletes in serious training.<p>• Diet.  Fueling the engine, specific to your goals, is key.  Micro and macronutrients, timing, and caloric content are the major factors.<p>&quot;Yoga&quot; itself is a multi-form discipline (the eightfold path) of which asanas (poses) are only one component.",1397591798

7593930,comment,7591049,7591597,4,0,robertgraham,,,"This isn&#x27;t true.<p>One of the things I&#x27;m famous for is creating &quot;BlackICE&quot; 15 years ago, an intrusion-detection technology that we shipped as a variety of products, such as a personal firewall, gigabit IDS, and inline protection (i.e. intrusion-prevention-system or IPS).<p>The distinguishing feature of this technology is that we wrote &quot;protocol-decodes&quot; for everything. This made the product faster, able to catch more things, yet producing fewer false-positives. It&#x27;s a vastly better technique than Snort-style pattern-matching.<p>Yet, it was an uphill battle convincing the market of this. That&#x27;s because people are stupid and don&#x27;t understand how things work well enough to appreciate the difference. All they know is that they download a public exploit, run it, and if the IDS catches it, then the IDS is good.<p>Today, there are lots of commercial products that do things the right way, with protocol decodes. There is also the open-source &quot;Bro&quot; project which does things the right way. All these products can catch my heartleech tool -- it can&#x27;t evade tools doing things the right way.<p>Even Snort often does things the right way, but only when people like me prod them. They are going to add an SSL decode (I predict).<p>So the upshot is this: I really are about the difference between protocol-analysis and pattern-matching in IDS technology, and as long as people like you aren&#x27;t smart enough to understand the difference, I&#x27;m going to keep releasing exploits to demonstrate it. None of my exploits evade properly written IDS -- only IDS that takes shortcuts.",1397591686

So the way it described backpropagation just &quot;clicked&quot; in a way that the previous articles that used tons of summation/matrix math/probability and calculus had not.  I’ve read some positively atrocious papers where it was like the authors were showing their notation prowess rather than conveying information.<p>Your chapters have a good balance, although for someone who’s been out of college for 15 years like me, it might be nice to have a tiny refresher about derivatives before you dive in, especially over several variables/dimensions.  I mean like a paragraph, to explain the notation, because the knowledge is in my head but foggy.  Everything else was very good, for example when you explained how bias comes from the threshold factor on the other side but makes notation easier.  I don’t remember seeing it explained quite that way before.  Oh and the sigmoid function always seemed arbitrary too (and frankly turned me off from neural nets because it seemed too analog), but explaining how it simplifies derivatives makes perfect sense now.<p>Unfortunately with other books, I was also never able to find off-the-shelf code that was approachable or up to date, so I ended up forgetting everything I had learned and had to start over each time until I got tired of trying.  I very much like your 72 line code example, where you provide a backpropagation function without explaining it yet.  That’s ok, as programmers we encounter that all of the time, and it’s actually kind of fun to decipher the algorithm before reading how it works later.  I believe it even allows for multiple hidden layers which is just fantastic.<p>As for the other stuff, well, I just look at it like this:<p>Ask a developer to write an iOS app that say, interacts with the twitter or facebook API and presents the user’s N closest friends in a list view and then submit that to the app store, and they can do it from start to finish with no mystery (other than a little help from stack overflow).  Each of those steps replies on some pretty heavy lifting like REST APIs, possibly SQL, message passing in objective-c, even a rudimentary understanding of security and encryption for networking and app submission, yet those things have become mainstream.<p>But ask a developer to do even the simplest machine learning task, like a little data mining or spam filtering, heaven forbid weak AI like image recognition, and it’s a whole different can of worms.  Why hasn’t anyone standardized this stuff in the languages that developers use every day, as opposed to MATLAB or prolog or whatnot?  Why can’t I literally read a text file and pipe it through a shell script that does a Bayes classifier?  Why doesn’t iOS have an AI.framework to go along with its Social.framework?  To me these aren’t all that much to ask.<p>I really feel that we’re still working at the assembly language or hand rolled affine texture mapping level from the 80s and 90s with respect to AI today.  We don’t have something like the web metaphor yet to catapult it into the mainstream.  That said, I’m extremely optimistic that concurrent (or at least parallelized) languages like Octave/NumPy/Go, and the more approachable functional languages like Haskell/Scala/Clojure might help deliver APIs that we can interact with from more mainstream languages.  To me, most weak AI problems have been solved now, and it’s time that programmers have an intuitive understanding of how the algorithms work so that they can combine them in novel ways and get to strong AI in, well, my lifetime hah.

Even though they let you choose where to direct .25 cents each day. So overall you have to be willing to give at least $6.00 a month.<p>I was hoping to really lower the barrier to donating by only asking for a .10 - .20 cent donation per person, per month. I think many more people would be willing to donate .10 - .20 cents per month instead of $6.00 per month.<p>.10 - .20 cents a month would not be a noticeable difference to most people, so people would sign up without any concern about their own finances.  As long as they could trust the payment options and donation service.<p>Lets take a look at a possible scenario here. Currently amazon micropayments charges credit cards 5% of transaction value + $0.05 for transactions anywhere between $.05 - $9.99.<p>Lets consider single transactions between .10 - .20 cents. Any transaction in this range comes with a 6 cent transaction fee. So you would receive a net payment of .04 - .14 cents per person per month.<p>Imagine an example where each person donates .20 cents and we receive .14 cents net per person after transaction fee. How many user do we need to get $500,000? About 3.57 million users.<p>Seems like a lot of people but it is only about .01% of the United States population. And since the website could take donations from anyone in the world willing to give .20 cents a month, I think attaining practical large sums would be achievable. And extremely affordable!<p>So .25 cents a day is good if you can afford it, but .20 cents a month is soo extremely affordable for most people and with scale it could add up to a lot!",1397590939

Since the crystal is a big tube, these phonons can only travel up, down, or create standing waves around the tube (essentially). When these phonons interact, there may be enough energy present to break the crystal/rope. This happens a lot since atoms are real small. Doping the crystal may help, but that&#x27;ll weaken it. Cooling it may help, but that&#x27;s costly. Much more basic research is needed.",1397590273

Ask yourself, what is harder to learn: (1) knowing who you are and how to work with others or (2) solving an algebraic equation?<p>They pretty much all learn how to read, write, do arithmetic. Those who want to go to college (about 80%) do so without difficulty, learning what they need in a few months. They are serious, engaged students in college because they know why they are there. They find college kids goofing off to be quite a mystery. They are free to become themselves when they are supposed to -- puberty. That&#x27;s what that stage is for. Most schools prevent the self-exploration that is necessary to allow for that. So then it gets delayed until people&#x27;s 20s.<p>--<p>Visit such a school and you will see that they are much less nasty than those in a public school. Bullying is virtually unheard of. They work together as a community and take responsibility for it. They are collectively responsible for all the policing and judgement of others as well as themselves. They adjudicate quite fairly.<p>I saw 8 year olds wrestling with determining an appropriate punishment for their friend vs. their own desire to help their friend. They really struggled to find a balance. 8 year olds. This is an issue that a lot of adults struggle with.<p>They also write themselves up when they break a rule. They all buy into building a community.

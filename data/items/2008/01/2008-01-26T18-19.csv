Any one would give you a much better understanding of what's possible:<p>* Human Molecular Genetics by Strachan and Read -- this is a tome, but it's a great introductory reference to the field.  (A lot of first-year grad students read this book when coming to molecular genetics from engineering and CS, incidentally.)<p>* Molecular Biology of the Cell, by Alberts et al. -- an even bigger tome, but one you'll find on every researcher's bookshelf.<p>* Genes NN by Lewin (where NN is an ever-increasing roman numeral;  you can estimate the amount of time someone has been in the field by the size of the roman numeral on their copy) -- this is more of an undergraduate introduction to molecular genetics.  The other books (especially MBC) are more useful as references, but this book is fairly accessible to newcomers.<p>* Recombinant DNA by Watson et al. -- I hesitate to include this in the list, because it's now sadly outdated (written in 1992), but I still think it's one of the best-written, most accessible introductions to things like transgenics, genetic engineering, etc.  Describes everything in a friendly, Scientific American style.  It's also small.  If you want a quick, friendly introduction to what was state-of-the-art 15 years ago, this is a great book.<p>I know that most of these books are kind of thick, and that you said you didn't want to digest the whole curriculum, but I don't tend to read pop-science books in this field.  I don't have much of an opinion on any particular popularization of molecular genetics.  But if you want to gain a real understanding of molecular biology, these are the books you'd most likely be told to buy for molecular genetics 101 at your local university.<p>PS: the giant metal birds eat Acme brand exploding bird seed, naturally....",1201373922

The FireGL did a little better because there wasn't as much competition in the professional graphics world, really just the Quadro and, to a lesser extent, Matrox's cards.  Wow... until I just wrote that, I had completely forgotten that Matrox ever even existed.",1201372757

Now I am sure that we all agree that entrepreneurs do in fact need to ""work for others"", namely the customer!<p>But yes there is something different about doing it in the role of supplier rather than employee. I think in general what entrepreneurs are after is about ""controlling their creative outputs and at least having the chance of being highly rewarded"". Sure you can do that to an extent as an employee, but putting your heart and soul into something as an employee makes one feel like a chump. Especially when you are surrounded with all the loafers and parasites within the common organization. (Sorry if that sounds harsh)<p>Since the guy in the article didn't really make any concrete policy recommendations, he could consider suggesting reforms within larger organizations to reduce alienation.",1201370843

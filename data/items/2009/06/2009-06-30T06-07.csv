I was just happy to work with web and being treated as equal member of a dev team. Learned quite a lot about web dev and business back then and I think it shaped me a lot.<p>Sometimes wonder that if you should try some ""real"" job, like basic customer service or physical labor.",1246345164

No, we are 'forced' to take our holidays all at once to spend time with our children, who DO have 'forced holidays'.",1246345100

680419,comment,679726,679891,0,0,whatusername,,,"So Australia just announced raising the Pension age (from 65 to 67  -- applies to people who are now about 50 and younger).  The figure that came out with that - was that when the pension was established 80 odd years ago - it was for a life expectancy of about 67 - the expectation was that it was support for old people about to die.  Since then - people are living much longer - and the age hasn't gone up.<p>Also note that Australia has compulsory Retirement savings (9% of Gross Income) for all employees!  Which is probably going to be my plan A, since I don't expect the Gov to be able to afford to  pay for me when I retire.",1246344710

If someone could start building an HTML 5 tool that makes simple Flash-style animations as simple to build as Flash itself, that would dramatically increase uptake. As it is right now, you really need to be a programmer to use it.<p>Microsoft has realized this with Silverlight and has working on these kinds of tools for the next release.

680407,comment,679348,679411,0,0,GreggW,,,"Okay, here's my $.02. I'm 55 and re-teaching myself Scheme (25 years ago, I edited the BYTE Magazine special issue on Lisp, and I just discovered that an excerpt from my review of The Little Schemer is now quoted on its back cover). I'm in the late stages of my training to be a marriage and family therapist (second MA at age 53), and I have an open-source project that I fiddle with (infoml.org). So what's my take on things?<p>Consciousnesses is far from binary; sometimes I think it's the most finely nuanced thing in the universe (read The Head Trip, by Jeff Warren). Speed of thought decreases--you got that right--but I've now got decades of experiences behind me, and these lead to thoughts I never could have imagined when I was 25. Unfortunately, it's not true that ""quality of thought won't diminish""--my father died with dementia at 85, and it certainly changed the last 20 years of his life. Change is the only constant in life, by the way, and flexibility and openness are your greatest assets in dealing with it.<p>As you grow older, meaningful connections to others, humble achievements (helping others at a personal level), and balance in all things become more important than power, money, and sexual conquest. I feel I'm far more creative than I was 20 years ago, but my desire to sacrifice balance for achievement <i>has</i> diminished; at this stage of my life, different things (as described above) are more important to me.<p>Some parts of getting older truly suck, but I am a lot happier and calmer that I used to be. I really know who I am now, and I can no longer be jerked around by what other people think. It's a great ride, and if you take care of yourself along the way (mentally, emotionally, physically, spiritually), it can be quite worthwhile. Good luck to you all doing whatever you're passionate about!",1246344182

680368,comment,679854,680111,0,0,jonknee,,,"> Additionally, why doesn't anyone talk about doing URL shortening on the CMS side? Sure the host portion of the URL might be a little longer than say 'bit.ly', but the remaining portion could be compressed. You could have a blog, news article, or whatever with an unobtrusive ""twitter link"" on the side. That way content owners still have some view into who is linking to their content.<p>Some sites do this. I bought some shoes the other day on Zappos and noticed all their permalinks have a shortened URL ready. Example: <a href=""http://www.zappos.com/product/126799/color/53739"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.zappos.com/product/126799/color/53739</a><p>Amazon should do this if for no other reason than most of their URLs are giant and unfriendly.",1246341812

1773360,comment,1772071,1773264,0,0,dotBen,,,"<i>What made you decide to go ahead with the .ly domain after you read about their terms of service?</i><p>Sure, thanks for asking - and perhaps I should highlight this elsewhere.<p>So we DID read the regulations (at <a href=""http://nic.ly/regulations.php"" rel=""nofollow"">http://nic.ly/regulations.php</a>).  It doesn't say ANYTHING in their regulations that they are going to make editorial decisions upon the content of your site (as I said previously, anything written on LibyanSpider.com is reference and not the article of record, and as it happens they have changed a lot of wording since we registered the domain 13+ months ago -- yes, they had no problems with this for over a year!).<p>People have written whole blog posts on how we were wrong because it says clearly they won't allow sexual or offensive references in domains.  But the wording in that caluse pertains to the DOMAIN and just the domain, not the content of the site.  And so the string ""vb"" in vb.ly clearly doesn't infringe on any issues around sexual or offensive content.<p>So we're good so far, would you not agree?<p>The area we considered, and which ultimately NIC.ly said we were in violation of is:<p><i>3.5 The Applicant certifies that, to the best of his/her knowledge the domain name is not being registered for any activities/purpose not permitted under Libyan law.</i><p>Now let me use what NIC.ly actually wrote to us, rather than this wider peanut gallery speculation that people are putting upon this.  As per <a href=""http://techyum.com/2010/10/official-vb-ly-link-shortener-seized-by-libyan-government/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://techyum.com/2010/10/official-vb-ly-link-shortener-sei...</a>, Mr Alaeddin S. ElSharif of NIC.ly wrote:<p><i>Moving up the Regulations list we find clause 3.5 clearly states that: “The Applicant certifies that, to the best of his/her knowledge the domain name is not being registered for any activities/purpose not permitted under Libyan law.”<p>Pornography and adult material aren’t allowed under Libyan Law, therefore we removed the domain,</i><p>Sure, ok: pornography and adult material isn't allowed under Libyan Law.<p>We didn't host any Pornography or adult material.  The site was a single page, as you can see from the screen grab on the TechYum url above.<p>So in conclusion I feel we performed the due diligence as per the regulations and stayed within the regs.  What I didn't expect is that NIC.ly would interpret their regulations quite liberally <i>(no pun intended)</i> in an effort to close the domain.  They claim there was a lot of pressure upon them internally to do that, but what I assumed (incorrectly) is that no matter what pressure there might be if something is within regs then I don't expect the rug to be pulled out from under me.<p>What do you make of the above, Jacques, seeing as you have been quite vocal on this top within this HN thread?<p>Thanks",1286571481

If one recognizes the supremacy of reason and applies it consistently, all the rest follows. <p> This — the supremacy of reason — was, is and will be the primary concern of my work, and the essence of Objectivism.

1773333,comment,1772923,1772923,0,0,lionhearted,,,"Read some quality history of long dead eras. I find the most intriguing to be Sengoku (Warring States) Japan, the transition from the late Roman Republic to the early Roman Empire, and Renaissance Italy. You can find good narratives and commentaries of these eras, like Edward Gibbon's History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire, Eiji Yoshikawa's Taiko (historical fiction, but accurate enough jumping off point). Reading a biography that follows one guy around can be pretty good - Julia Cartwright's ""Baldissare Castiglione"" is pretty good, it's a good read especially if you've already read The Prince by Machiavelli. (Definitely read a commentary/analyis of The Prince alongside it, though, so you understand the pressures on Machiavelli while writing)<p>Likewise, reading autobiographies and first hand accounts alongside commentaries can be interesting. I like Julius Cesar's autobiographical ""The Gallic Wars."" I have an electronic copy of Flavius Josephus's Books of the History of the Jewish War against the Romans, but haven't read it yet - but that looks really, really fascinating to me. I'll read it along with a commentary.<p>Understanding old politics (Roman, fragmented Italy states, fragmented Japan followed by unified Japan) has helped me understand new politics. Basically, the mainstream interpretation of anything political that happened after year 1750 or so is questionable and suspect. By all means, still learn modern history, but there's so much misinformation out there.<p>If you want a real head trip, go read Abraham Lincoln's first inaugural address. That'll show you how inaccurate the mainstream interpretation of events 200 years ago are. Really, seriously, it messed with my head when I read it -<p><a href=""http://www.bartleby.com/124/pres31.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.bartleby.com/124/pres31.html</a><p>Read his thoughts on slavery and fugitive slaves in there, and his argument for why nonviolent secession from the union is an act of violence. ""In your hands, my dissatisfied fellow-countrymen, and not in mine, is the momentous issue of civil war. The Government will not assail you. You can have no conflict without being yourselves the aggressors.""<p>Start with the history of old politics if you want to understand new politics. Everything you've learned post-1750 without verifying from primary sources is suspect. I'm not exaggerating, nor am I a conspiracy theorist - I dig around through primary sources. Ever stop and wonder why the Japanese bombed Pearl Harbor after the USA was its closest ally from the formation of the Empire up until four years before the war broke out?<p>All mainstream views on modern politics are suspect. Start with older eras with issues we aren't emotional about today, then once understanding duplicity and doublespeak, start learning about the modern era. For the record, I wholly support Lincoln and think he was a great President, despite the fact that I have a 180 degree different view of his intentions than most people. (In my view from my studies, he was a pure conquest imperialist, not any sort of liberator... but I still like him and think he made largely the right choice after the secession)",1286571083

Do you really need to hide variables or make real inheritance in a simple language? ""Information hiding"" is overvalued and actually rarely really needed on the single class level -- you have to care only about interfaces. Which are probably going to remain too clumsy as long as you use header files (in my humble opinion, I always liked Turbo Pascal (and Modula) modules, more recently Go also manages to avoid headers).<p>void for return type was needed in ANSI C only because omitting it would mean int in the code written in old K&R. You can make void as default when the return type is not specified and keep the code nicer. Ditto for no parameters. You'll get the slim appearance of K&R C code and the semantic would still be clear to everybody as nobody would assume he's reading K&R C. Or would he in your case, even with strings etc?<p>Btw C++ since recently has<p><pre><code>    auto n = 1; // int
    auto s = ""abc""; // char ptr
</code></pre>
but IMHO Limbo idea is clearer and wouldn't introduce any problems (it's really easy to add the new operators for ""declare and assign"" and the semantic is obvious):<p><pre><code>     n := 1;
     s := ""abc"";

It may also offer some direct revenue; they already charge (U.S. customers) for foreign calls.<p>Hmm... will Google roll out a SIP telecommunications service, at some point, to go along with their professional Apps offers?

There was a lull in business (layoffs, no interesting projects, y'know), so I quit and went to work at the mother division, which was still part of LSi.  They had fun stuff to work on.<p>A couple of years after hiring on, LSi was bought by an investment company (Forestmann Little) and the Instrument Division was sold to Smiths Industries.  It remained SI[1]  for about 15 years.  About three years ago, the avionics portion of Smiths was sold to GE.<p>Bill Lear was an entrepreneur, big time.  Thinking back, while I signed on several years after Bill Lear was kicked out of LSi, the entrepreneurial spirit was still alive there.  We were creating novel interesting products (e.g. the first solid state crash survivable flight data recorders).  As time went on, the division became less entrepreneurial and more enterprisal (to coin a word ;-).<p>The Dilbert Moment[2] was when the VP of engineering called a meeting of all the engineering departments and told all of us that we weren't going to be writing software or designing hardware any more.  Instead, we were going to be a Tier 1 Systems House.<p>[1] Side note, my buddies registered si.com, which Smiths ultimately sold to Sports Illustrated at a pretty nice profit.  My buddies didn't even get a ""thank you."" :-/<p>[2] One of my favorite Dilbert comic strips:<p>1. PHB, pointing to PPT slide: ""We'll save money by outsourcing our I.T. function.""<p>2. PHB, pointing to PPT slide: ""Then we'll save more money by replacing our outsourcing with fulltime employees!""<p>3.

I figured (correctly, I think) that my problem was not with my hacking abilities but with my business skills - I had absolutely no good sense of what people would give me money for.<p>In my mind, I saw myself stumbling around on a seemingly infinite plane while I was trying to follow a hill-climbing algorithm to maximize the amount of money I was making. So I imagined something like a random-restart approach might work: let's jump somewhere totally different and try climbing any hills we find there. Plus, I knew that people were willing to give money for baked goods, so I figured that simplified the business component to an extent.<p>It turns out I was right - I did find a hill to climb and I've gotten a lot better at business in general.<p>The dilemma now is I really enjoy coding and actually think I have the skills to run a softare business (which could ultimately be more lucrative), but have a growing food business on my hands. I'm certainly not complaining - really, anything that brings me more money to buy stuff like a dryer makes me happy - but sometimes I feel out of place.<p>Now that I've hired a manager for the bakery, I have a bit more control of my time and I've recently been able to take on a bit of consulting work, which has turned out well, and I'm pumping the money into growing the bakery.<p>I think that's the optimal strategy I can follow for now.

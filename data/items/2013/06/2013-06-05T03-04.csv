5823607,comment,5819394,5823514,2,0,3d3mon,,,"Null references do make reading code more complex for the user since every function call must be prefaced with a null check. If I make a function call in every line of my code adding all the null checks would easily double my line count, burying my code in Java-like verbosity (ok not that much but you get the idea). I suppose a good IDE could help with this if option types remain unavailable.<p>Another common complaint with null references is that there is no compile-time type safety that you get with option types. The go team could mitigate this by having the compiler check for possible null references that may not have been caught and emit warnings or refuse to compile.",1370404698

- Is everyone in same office/building or are team members remote? If remote, what strategies and tools are in place to make it seamless?
- Who is on a ""team""? (just other devs? cross-functional? if so, does it include QA, BA, UX project management, ops or product management)? How do teams interact?
- How is development organization success measured? 
- How is professional & personal development addressed by the organization?<p>- What is the platform? What tools are used? Is there integration between issue/task tracking & source code & builds? Using CI? 
- What is process/budget for procuring or updating additional productivity/developer tools and hardware?
- Is there a development/QA/staging environment? Who maintains those?<p>- What development process is used? How long are cycles? How is it measured? Who is responsible for the process and the various activities in the process?
- How does development process integrate with support/delivery/ops processes?
- How is product roadmap and direction set? How are changes handled?
- Who is responsible for overall architecture & UX? Who makes trade-off decisions?
- How can I evaluate if I am being productive & effective in the organization?
- Who will be most likely to give me feedback about code, features, contributions?<p>Re: testing comment - Ask ""What is your definition of quality""? Is it related to meeting expected behaviors or do they use a narrow metric like bug count / severities? How are expected behaviors of the system established?

5823591,comment,5821808,5822756,4,0,five18pm,,,"Allowing foreign investment is a minor problem in ecommerce space. Flipkart has foreign investment via VCs for quite some time.<p>There are a lot more fundamental issues in ecommerce space.<p>(1) Low penetration of credit cards - Banks have slowed down considerably their efforts to market credit cards. RBI regulations don't help either. Besides both of these, people have a negative feeling towards credit cards. So credit card usage is low. Cash is king and debit cards and direct bank transfers are next.<p>(2) Payment is a pain. Paying via credit card, debit card or bank account goes through a two step authentication process which is fraught with failures. There are multiple sites through which payment is routed => Seller site -> Payment gateway intermediary -> Bank site -> (enter password to authenticate payment) -> Back to intermediary -> Back to seller site. This long chain is breaks more often than not. And when it breaks, it becomes a pain to get your money back. Buying something online, especially for some one new is a heart-in-your-mouth experience. Again, RBI guidelines prevent any change in the payment process. It is easier to use Cash on Delivery (CoD).<p>(3) Two and three means that most customers prefer CoD. But CoD is a pain for merchants. There is no guarantee that customers would end up completing the sale. Most purchases are impulse purchases. But in case of CoD, you receive the product after 2-3 days, long after the impulse is gone. So the rejection rate for CoD sales is high compared to Credit/debit card sales.<p>(4) Logistics is another nightmare. The companies do not have scale and are quite expensive compared to the cost of goods sold. They are also not reliable. Delivery management and providing customer support for late/missing shipments forms the bulk of support cost. So any medium/large ecommerce company starts its own courier service. Suddenly these companies are not just ecommerce companies, they are also managing a completely new and different business.<p>(5) Low internet penetration and usage.<p>(6) Wafer thin margins. The margins are already thin. It is spread even thinner by offering free shipping. Shipping used to be free for any product of any cost. Its only now that companies have started charging for shipping. These thin margins mean companies won't be breaking even any time soon. Its a long haul game and its going to leave quite a few dead companies in its midst.",1370404420

5823568,comment,5820141,5820141,1,0,code_diego_code,,,"I'm a former NMR spectroscopist (a chemist who works with the same technology as MRI devices--though at even higher magnetic field strengths to in order to study the shapes of various molecules). I've quite spent a lot of time working around high-field superconducting NMRs without incident.<p>To clarify the the ""nuclear"" part, magnetic resonance technology does not in any way involve nuclear reactions or the ensuing radiation from such, so you can rest easy on that one.<p>Additionally, MRI also doesn't utilize any ionizing radiation in the scanning process. This is one of the major advantages of imaging via MRI technology as opposed to using x-rays in traditional radiography or newer CT technologies.<p>What happens in NMR is that certain atomic nuclei like to align themselves with the magnetic field that they happen to find themselves in, much in the same way that you might see iron filings on a piece of paper aligning themselves with the magnetic field lines created by a toy magnet. This is where we get the M, or magnetic, part of MRI.<p>When these aligned nuclei are then exposed to radio waves, they will absorb and slightly later, re-emit the signal at specific resonance frequencies. This is where the R in MRI comes from. Now the trick is that the exact frequency where this happens depends on how the electrons surrounding that nucleus are arranged (which is mainly a function of what other atoms might be bonded to the one yu're looking at).<p>The timing and frequency at which this radio re-emission occurs allows chemists and radiologists to determine various bits of information about the different environments that these particular atoms have found themselves in, making it a very useful tool for determining chemical properties or non-invasively taking pictures of the interior of people's bodies.<p>Around very high-field magnets (particularly the superconducting types used in research NMR spectrometers and high-resolution closed tube MRI scanners), however, you do need to be careful about the magnets--and what ferromagnetic objects you may be bringing near or into them and how the field may affect them.<p>I trust most MRI techs and spectroscopists understand the proper safety procedures around their machines well enough to not allow themselves or their patients to create hazardous situations involving the magnets. These are some delicate and very expensive machines. That being said, failures can be quite spectacular--imagine Magneto and Iceman having a battle royale in your lab.<p>I think this is quite enough for one post, I'll leave the medical risks involving contrast dyes and incidentalomas to those more knowledgeable than myself.",1370403838

They are also less potentially damaging to the environment, being largely made of inert or benign materials. A flywheel can potentially have an indefinite working lifespan.  Flywheels built as part of James Watt steam engines have been continuously working for more than two hundred years. Another advantage of flywheels is that by a simple measurement of the rotation speed it is possible to know the exact amount of energy stored. Flywheels with Magnetic bearings and high vacuum can maintain 97% mechanical efficiency, and 85% round trip efficiency.</i><p>Why aren't these in wide deployment yet as local storage for renewable energy sources? The biggest problems seems to be overall mass, cost, and space efficiency. None are great concerns for long term energy storage solutions for off-grid buildings. In short, these things sound fantastic.

The notaries must check several state and country records (with assorted fees), checking for mortgages, impounds, even parking or speeding tickets (across all 19 states, which have separate records and systems). Then they write a special contract, which has special legal validity since it was witnessed by a notary. That contract is entered into the country registry of property.<p>After all that, you have to pay your notary a hefty sum (3% of the properties' value for houses, and several hundred dollars for cars, even clunkers), both buyer and seller sign the contract, the notary witnesses the act, buyer gives the money to the seller and you're done.<p>So, after a few weeks, if all goes well, you can proceed to give the keys to the buyer :P<p>Edit: it's worse, here's another version (which skips several steps, but adds some I'd forgotten)<p><a href=""http://board.totaluruguay.com/Transportation/Purchasing_cars"" rel=""nofollow"">http://board.totaluruguay.com/Transportation/Purchasing_cars</a><p>""The usual order of events when buying a used car is...<p>1. Find the particular vehicle you want to buy either privately or from a dealer.

If you are used to northern second hand car prices, be prepared to pay an apparently eye-watering sum for an old car with an improbably high kilometer reading.<p>2. Find yourself an escribano/a to do the paperwork.<p>3. You and the vendor visit the escribano, present your IDs, sign the contract for sale, the purchaser pays the money, the vendor hands over a sheaf of papers and the escribano will provide the purchaser with the appropriate paperwork for the junta local to prepare a new ""libretta"" (plastic coated car registration card) with your name, your physical address and the car's details.<p>3. Before driving the car to the junta local, the purchaser will need to insure the car as insurance is now compulsory and the junta local will want to see a certificate of insurance.<p>4. On arrival at the junta local, the car will be physically inspected by a funcionario to ensure that the engine and chassis numbers on the vehicle match those on the paperwork. If the car lacks a current ""patente"" you will be charged for however many months are due for the remainder of the calendar year. If the vendor lived in the same departmento as the purchaser, the existing plates go with the vehicle. If you are re-registering the vehicle in a different departmento, you will be issued with new plates. It used to be the case that the cost of the patente varied from departmento to departmento. I have heard that patentes are to be standardised across the ROU from 2012.<p>5. The escribano will start a series of searches to ensure that there are no outstanding fines nor other charges due on the car in all 19 departmentos of the ROU. This process can take several months but you can continue to drive the car in the meantime. You cannot take the car out of the ROU until this paperwork has been completed as one of the documents will be a certificate from the Ministry of Culture confirming that the former owner(s) were not Uruguayo figures of cultural importance. :-) ""<p>That's why my country has the dubious distinction of being ""most bureaucratic country on earth"" for several kinds of stuff (car transfers being one, and construction being another, being so bizarre as you having to have a permit and pay taxes to paint your own home)",1370401984

And people who move from areas with higher housing prices to areas with lower housing prices benefit to the detriment of those who do the opposite, because the windfall they get when they sell their home is larger than it would be otherwise -- which again promotes urban sprawl, because it increases the financial incentive for existing urbanites to move to the suburbs, and creates a similar effect for renters because higher real estate prices mean higher rents but the renters don't get the deduction so they have to move farther away from the cities to find affordable rental properties.",1370401572

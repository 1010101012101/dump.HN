Does this safe the author's answer?<p>Nope!<p>Their code for n > 0 would fail on such a machine. They are relying on repeated division by 2 eventually resulting in 0 in order to terminate the recursion.

3635069,comment,3634560,3634979,2,0,ghshephard,,,"There are a lot of photo manipulation tools out there that cost a great deal less than Photoshop goes for.  Much of their market consists of people who find Photoshop too expensive.  Alternatively, one can purchase a new version every three-four years - bringing the cost down to something like $10-$15/month.  I've got a several-years old version of CS3 running on my MacBook Air.  Works just as well as it did when it was considered the latest-and-greatest.  I suspect, as a non-professional graphics designer, I'll do fine purchasing a new copy every 8-10 years or so.<p>I'd rather Adobe make a decent profit on their tools from their high-end commercial clients so they can continue to invest, do research, and improve the product.  The rest of us can get by with an ""Academic Version"", slightly outdated version, or cage a heavily discounted copy off of a friend-of-friend who works for Adobe.  If you are working in the graphic design industry, Linkedin probably has you two or three hops away from an Adobe employee, and I guarantee that if you are ""in the biz"" and impoverished to the point of having a tough time paying for a new retail copy of CS5, someone will have a employee credit that they can give you.  Heck, there's a good chance that if you write (and design) an impassioned plea to Adobe Marketing, Adobe will comp you a discounted copy.",1330240736

That should help with scalability, and performance at scale.  For example, if PUT is actually implemented properly, then you can implement write-back caching semantics with a general-purpose HTTP proxy.  The way that Rails currently abuses PUT, a general-purpose proxy can only implement write-<i>through</i> caching (at best), or it needs to be customized for the specific application in use.<p>Also, it's standardizing the language that <i>developers</i> are using to interact with each other, and reducing the amount of work needed to build interoperable software.  As more and more websites turn into web services (even if those services are only consumed by e.g. client-side Javascript), this should result in cost savings and faster time-to-market as more businesses move in that direction.<p>Finally, a lot of web apps are basically just CRUD (create/read/update/delete) apps.  The more we standardize the on-the-wire protocols for these routine operations, the more we can push those protocols into application frameworks.

But there's <i>also</i> the side where the seller's price is below the demand curve, but the buyer pirates it anyway to capture more consumer surplus.<p>What's really happening is that, the easier piracy becomes, the closer the supply curve comes to turning into a very flat line at price 0. Now, the actual cost to the consumer in time, energy, bandwidth, and guilt is higher than 0, and it's possible to reduce those costs by trading off some actual money cost to get the permission of copyright holders the way Apple or Rdio are doing, but it's not clear that this will last forever.",1330239652

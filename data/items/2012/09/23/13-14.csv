Of course, supercomputers have largely moved on from shared memory systems to clusters, and have larger aggregate bandwidth - but shared memory still has its uses. Just a point for all the comparisons to smartphones and what not.<p>EDIT: just to expand on this a bit, this means that there are workloads that these old-school supercomputers will run much faster than a modern high-end desktop. This particularly applies to workloads which have a lot of shared memory access at random locations - a very difficult case for the modern systems, which depend on high cache hit rates. Also, the GFLOPS ratings of these supercomputer processors are in many ways more real than the ratings of commodity processors, which depend on the pipelines being filled in very specific ways. So no, you can't replace this system (at least the 32-processor version) with a smartphone or even a desktop. Which is not to say it would be cost-effective at 39 million of 1996 dollars.",1348408791

At one point I was brewing about twice a month and seriously considered setting up my own automation system. Now I brew less frequently (maybe 4-6 times a year) and its become more enjoyable to just gave the semi-organized chaos on an early weekend morning. Plus I usually give most of my beer away and my friends enjoy the free, decen beer<p>I know I'll probably never be able to recreat most beers I make now, but who cares. There are so many styles, ingredients, and wacky concepts out there that I never brew the same thing twice. Plus, when I get that magical batch every so I often it usually wins me some new brew toys at the local competitions.<p>The one thing I would like to automate is fermentation temperature, but it's been difficult to convince the wife that I need another fridge next to the kegerator.<p>RDWHAHB",1348408660

Still, I've got one thing going for me: I'm very quick at picking up new keyboard shortcuts and habits. I'm a vim user, and every few weeks I switch around some shortcut to make things easier for myself - and it usually only takes a day to adjust. I don't know if this is abnormal or not, but a lot of people really complain very loudly every time shortcuts are changed on them, so maybe I'm the odd one out here.<p>Also, I work hard at fixing big incoviences. For example, I can't stand the way maximize works on the Mac... but it doesn't matter, since I have a program that makes it work like in Windows. The trick is to give the new behaviour a fair shot before ""fixing"" it, since sometimes the new behaviour is better - for example, using command+tab (alt-tab in windows) only work between different applications, and having a separate shortcut for switching Windows in the same application - that's <i>much better</i> than in Windows, but at first I really hated it.<p>My biggest gripe with OSX right now, by the way, is the Finder.

Now instead of em-http-request I have much better working Curl::Easy and the whole codebase is much easier to understand.<p>[1] <a href=""https://github.com/SponsorPay/em-resque"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/SponsorPay/em-resque</a>",1348407547

They don't <i>quite</i> mix and match perfectly and I had to file down a couple places on the frame to make it fit. This is a fairly popular modification among enthusiasts of the classic Thinkpad line, as it's generally thought to be the best possible 4:3 Thinkpad. The keyboard came from an unknown machine (ebay) and was on a W500 for a while; I chose the part number generally regarded as slightly better than the others. The wifi card, hard drive, AC adapter and battery came from a W500. The wifi card required a BIOS hacked to remove the hardware whitelist.<p>The current specs are:<p><pre><code>    Display: 15"" IPS panel, 1600x1200, matte\n    CPU: Intel T7700, upgradeable to T9500\n    GPU: Nvidia QuadroFX 570M, 128MB\n    Memory: 8GB DDR2 dual-channel @ 667 MHz\n    Disk: 320GB 5400RPM, hacked BIOS supports SATAII\n    Optical: DVD multi-burner\n</code></pre>\nI'm not done. Planned upgrades:<p><pre><code>    Display: QXGA (2048x1536) panel, when I can find one for less than $400\n    CPU: If something Penryn shows up cheap or free, I'll put it in\n    Disk: An SSD, obviously, perhaps with a hard drive in the optical bay\n    Battery: I'm betting there are some modern cells with higher capacity I can put in the old shell\n</code></pre>\nPretty much everything that can be done with these has been done by somebody on <a href=""http://forum.thinkpads.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://forum.thinkpads.com</a>, so it's pretty low-risk if the idea of a semi-custom laptop appears to you. 4:3 T61 motherboards and QXGA panels are rare and often priced higher than you would expect, but the rest of the parts are cheap and easy to come by.

So let's see.<p>Searching for that phrase under Home: ""Sorry, there is nothing that matches your search."" (!!!)  Fail.<p>Searching for that phrase under Applications: ""Sorry, there are no applications that match your search.""  Okay!<p>Searching for that phrase under Files and Folders: ""Sorry, there are no files or folders that match your search."" (!!!)  Fail.<p>Searching for that phrase under Music: Gives me 15 results that are ""Available to purchase"", but clicking on them results in Banshee media player coming up, with no file playing.  I have no idea where these results are coming from and can't do anything with them.  My local files do not come up.  Fail.<p>Searching for that phrase under Videos: Gives me results from ""Online"", some of which appear to have indigo girls in the title and some of which do not.  Apparently these are movies on Youtube that I can rent for $2.99.  Most of them don't have anything to do with the Indigo Girls, but I guess you'd get a cut if I rented any of these random movie selections.  The top result you suggest for ""indigo girls"" is ""Ladies vs Ricky Bahl"", which is some Bollywood movie that has nothing to do with the Indigo Girls.  At least they actually work, unlike the Music suggestions.  Fail.<p>So in sum, Mark - your lens search utterly, utterly fails at searching for the couple hundred files that are on my computer that match it, and it also fails at monetizing my search results with Youtube and wherever the Music search is supposed to send me to.  It literally does not work, at all, in the slightest.  At no point did ANY of my local files come up in that search.  (Searching for ""Indigo"" and ""indigo"" had identical results - none of my local files found.  In fact file search doesn't work at all for any search.)<p>Again, this is stock Ubuntu 12.04.<p>>Were interested in feedback in what sorts of things would be useful to search straight from the home lens, and how to improve the search results, as well as provide better control of the process to you.<p>I'm going to suggest that you search for local files.

I thereby understand that me giving $10,000 to Ubuntu, in the grand scheme of things, is meaningless in comparison to a reality where every serious user of Ubuntu was paying them $200.<p>I thereby contend that having a system of open-ended donations that requires physical mail with checks or money orders is a problem. You can tell me <i>I'm</i> not contributing enough, but that is both insulting to me and <i>completely misses the point</i>.<p>Note: at this point, you could simply have said ""you misread that page, the Click & Pledge system lower down actually allows you to donate without physical anything"", but you didn't quite; my response would have been: ""I seriously did not notice that, and I'm sorry"".<p>That said, I am not certain how much that changes the overall point: that entire page seems accidentally designed to make people consider donating to Debian both difficult and even ""scary"": as someone who has to do a lot of writing for random people who may not speak English very well to read, a lot of people are going to think that paragraph about identity theft applies to their online transaction, and not to the Debian Foundation posting accounts to wire.<p>Secondly, I did not make the argument at the end: I accepted that I could appreciate other people making that argument. Instead, I made the longer argument through the previous set of paragraphs that Ubuntu should actively charge for things.<p>Your last paragraph and its closing question is thereby highly confusing, and makes me question both whether you read my comment, and whether I should bother responding to yours. That said, I will now put on the hat of the people I overall disagree with and attempt to answer your question.<p>I, personally, am involved in what I, as well as many, consider more of a ""movement"" than a product: a specific form of hacking known as ""jailbreaking"" mobile devices, and in particular the iPhone (although I also do Android work).<p>In this capacity, I have seen many different people who have myriad opinions on what happens when you inject the concerns of managing money into a decentralized system, and I have seen first hand what happens ""on the inside"".<p>For one, you immediately get concerns about who is contributing what to the project, and thereby how the money should be allocated. As the contributions are decentralized, it is not clear that any one person or even one group of people should ""own allocation"".<p>In the case of Ubuntu, I imagine that even getting donations is tense. It is my understanding that many of the people working on Debian or with past ties to Debian feel that the Ubuntu project's primary purpose is to leach off their effort.<p>Meanwhile, I contend that things can get even worse if you start charging. Of course, as I believe that charging is the right course of action, I actually do charge for things personally, so I can talk about how people react to these kinds of charges.<p>The result is that a lot of people now believe you are ""rolling in the money"", when in fact you are a community project that is reinvesting the money you receive in improved output by hiring people and donating the rest.<p>This is difficult for end users to contemplate, however, as all they see is that they are having to pay $200 for an operating system distributed via a medium with a near-$0 marginal production cost (downloadable/copyable files).<p>However, again, I think that this entire diversion is weird, because I spent an entire post attempting to argue that Ubuntu should charge for things, linking to an argument made by other people, and attempting to state that donations might not be enough.<p>Thereby, my arguments for why Ubuntu should <i>not</i> accept or even demand money might not be very good: if you are seriously attempting to ask that question, you should ask it to someone who is actually on that side of the argument.",1348405736

That would make a nice replacement for Firefox's search bar. It might even increase your affiliate revenue.

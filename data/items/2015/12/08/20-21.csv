These kids shows have been pushed down the age bracket, appealing to younger markets where demand is a lot greater for the content. Older kids shows? They exist in the spaces between cartoon network hot properties, and do a good job of confronting the complex issues kids will face from 4-12. The same is true of The Mr. Rogers->Daniel Tiger&#x27;s Neighborhood. They&#x27;re tuned for totally different age ranges and <i>requirements</i>.<p>I dunno how many of you are parents. I have a 15 month old daughter. A constant chime of the following information is reiterated by child care consulting, doctors, and developmental evaluators:<p>- Sensory experiences are more important than anything right now.\n- Emotional stability is more important than anything.\n- Disregard the advice about &quot;no screen time.&quot; Screens shouldn&#x27;t be a substitute for parenting, but kids can learn to use tablets startlingly early in life and interactive education is provably better than passive education. In some specific subjects, interactive solo play is superior even to parentally guided play.<p>Let&#x27;s also not forget: This article is just false. The idea that no one ever corrects Elmo? Totally wrong. Elmo gets a lot of screen time, but over the last year we&#x27;ve seen a huge amount of investment in a lot of other characters. Cookie Monster, Abby&#x27;s complexity, and most importantly a huge increase in the time <i>humans</i> spend on sesame street talking.<p>The idea that Seasme Street doesn&#x27;t touch on tricky subjects is false. Just last week the PBS Kids app rotated the episode on &quot;Minne Myna&quot;. It&#x27;s a two-sided story. On the one hand, Big Bird makes a case to bird court that someone else can&#x27;t steal his nest just because he left it. &quot;Finders Keepers is a bad rule.&quot;<p>But it&#x27;s <i>also</i> trying to talk to kids and say it is okay to be sad and that they SHOULD be sad if they lose their homes. The episode is delicately touching on the subject of home eviction. Someone who has never been evicted might not even notice, but anyone who has lost a home will immediately realize what Big Bird&#x27;s singing about. Big Bird gets a happy ending, but the episode leaves reminding kids that many other birds didn&#x27;t get their nests back and that it&#x27;s okay to be sad.<p>I see so much of these kinds of articles. All I can do is despair as my generation begins to make the exact same mistake as our outrageous parents who had very similar things to say about childhood programming which we all wax nostalgically on now.",1449607869

In my interviews experience, it is unlikely that you&#x27;d be asked to implement quick sort, but that&#x27;s because you&#x27;ll be asked a question that requires realizing that a the question reduces to quick sort (this is how companies can avoid hiring people who just memorize solutions).  For instance, instead of being asked to create all permutations of a string and all its substrings, you&#x27;ll be asked a question that involves analyzing a set that needs to be permuted a similar way (this is my example, not from an actual interview, but I&#x27;d say it would count as about a medium level difficult question).  If you don&#x27;t know quick sort cold (or, in the case of my example, how to print all permutations of a string), there&#x27;s no way you&#x27;d be able to program something that requires modifying and adapting these algorithms in 45 minutes at a whiteboard.<p>And yeah, again YMMV, but you definitely do need to largely solve the problem, so speed absolutely does matter here.<p>The really frustrating thing about all this is that if the experience causes you to go back, study algorithms, buy cracking the coding interview, and getting incredibly good at these questions, your next interview will involve… detailed questions about ruby syntax, followed by another interview with questions about how the JVM works, followed by another interview with questions about how MapReduce works[1].<p>Not saying this is good or bad, just that this is how it is, at least at the harder interviews.<p>Based on the final paragraph, it looks like triple byte does see the market opportunity here.  The frustrating moving target of interview questions could correlate very well with what type of programmers a company is looking for.  Considering that every interview requires a day (or more) off and a stressful and mentally taxing series of in-person exams, there&#x27;s only so much one candidate can take before giving up and just staying in his or her job (assuming the candidate is currently employed).  So if a company becomes aware of how to align candidate type with interview path, if you can line up with the algorithms style interviews, the person can slowly learn until getting a job offer, rather than experiencing a reset button.  I wish them luck with this, because they&#x27;d be adding real value to a developer&#x27;s job search, which isn&#x27;t something devs typically expect from a recruiter.",1449607721

The obvious argument was that it made it easier for the little inventors to get their patents approved across all of europe. It removed bureaucracy and it made it cheaper.<p>But here is the thing. By making it easier to get your patents approved in one country to be valid in all of EU countries you are also opening up for patent trolls because now it&#x27;s much cheaper for them to try and get patents.<p>So in a weird way many would argue it&#x27;s going to have the opposite effect. It&#x27;s going to make it easier for those who specialize in patents to start getting access to markets it was too expensive before. (In fact a US patent troll has been setting up their office in Ireland exactly because of the expected unification of the Patent Process)<p>For startups the unification is also presenting itself as kind of a headache because when you unify something a bunch of countries have to adhere to whatever the unification results in. So again it sounds great on paper but the consequence might well be unfortunate.<p>And now this. Which sounds great but is going to present more problems than it&#x27;s solving.<p>What Europe really need is for the taxation side of the markets to be unified NOT the legislative process yet this is exactly what the EU does again and again and it&#x27;s hurting more than it&#x27;s helping.<p>I wrote more about this issue in this essay for those who might be interested: <a href=""http://000fff.org/why-is-europe-failing-to-create-more-unicorns"" rel=""nofollow"">http://000fff.org/why-is-europe-failing-to-create-more-unico...</a>",1449607535

10699314,comment,10698009,10698773,0,0,johncolanduoni,,,"> It is illegal discrimination to make hiring decisions based on IQ scores. You can only use a test that shows those with higher scores perform better at the job.<p>There is more scientific evidence that IQ predicts job performance than for most of the more qualitative criterions that employers use in practice. The source of the illegality of using IQ tests is not legislative (intelligence is not a protected class[1]). It comes from the precedent of <i>Griggs v. Duke Power Co.</i>, in which the IQ test was being used as a barrier for jobs where IQ was not a good predictor (not programming), and prior to thorough research on the subject. There have been hundreds of studies showing that IQ tests predict job performance (though not super strongly) at the beginning of careers, even though this fades once they have more experience. This[3] meta-analysis approaches these studies very critically, and concludes that many inflate the effect, and that it doesn&#x27;t validate the IQ test (i.e. there may be non-cognitive reasons for it) but that the correlation still exists. (For what it&#x27;s worth, I suspect they&#x27;re right about the non-cognitive part since the correlation has become much stronger over time, particularly around the 1970s. However, when your goal is to test for something and not to explain it, correlation is good enough.)<p>> Basically you can not ask questions that test skills that would not be used in the job the candidate is applying for. ... You must be able to defend the metric you use for hiring and that it is not discriminatory.<p>No, the burden set in <i>Griggs</i> and later elaborated in a modification to the Civil Rights Act is not to prove that a test is not discriminatory at all. Instead for tests that <i>are</i> discriminatory in practice (though not obviously in design, like IQ), you must show that the test is truly indicative of job performance. If this were not the case, you couldn&#x27;t ask if people went to college, due to the racial disparity in college graduates. Also you can ask things you can&#x27;t prove are related to job performance if it isn&#x27;t discriminatory (not that this is really useful).<p>> If you give an IQ test that is unrelated to the job and say no one below 100 IQ will be hired you must prove that someone with 101 IQ can do the job but someone with 99 IQ can not properly do the job<p>Of course you don&#x27;t have to show that anyone who fails your test will 100% be worse on a case by case basis than someone who passes. If that were the case you couldn&#x27;t justify pretty much any test other than &quot;applicant is not dead or in a coma.&quot; You just need to show that it is clearly less likely. I would find it <i>really</i> surprising if there wasn&#x27;t some kind of IQ threshold effect for programming (i.e. the closer you are to the middle of the spectrum, the better a predictor of programming performance IQ is). That would make it easy to justify using an IQ test as a predictor, especially in combination with the more general studies.<p>I don&#x27;t think IQ would be terribly useful to weed out programmers because I suspect there are more related ways to judge applicants that would already weed out those in the region where IQ is useful, but it is not as simple as &quot;IQ testing for a job is illegal.&quot;<p>[1]: <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protected_class"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protected_class</a>\n[2]: <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Griggs_v._Duke_Power_Co"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Griggs_v._Duke_Power_Co</a>.\n[3]: <a href=""http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10888691.2014.983635"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10888691.2014.98...</a>",1449607299

That indicates there&#x27;s something you&#x27;d rather be doing than your work, but the pay is too good to leave.

That Google search field to the right of the URL field? Opera pioneered that business model in 2001 - followed by Mozilla and Apple half a decade later. Sorry, I get carried away. :D",1449607096

Like a parent, I love both of them for completely different reasons.<p>From a pure language standpoint, Java and C# are _really_ well-designed tools. I call them &quot;Cathedral Languages&quot; after esr&#x27;s &quot;Cathedral and the Bazaar&quot; -- both were designed by highly-qualified teams of experts who had the privilege of spending years designing them, after already spending collectively many lifetimes doing language design. For examples of what I&#x27;m talking about, look at C#&#x27;s implementation of generics. Look at the quality of .NET or Java&#x27;s multi-generational mark-and-sweep garage collector implementations. Ruby has a lot of warts. It&#x27;s slow. MRI/REE are children&#x27;s toys compared to the CLR or JVM. Ruby&#x27;s implementation of coroutines (blocks vs. procs vs. lambdas) is a huge mess, its concurrency story is terrible, it has nothing like .NET&#x27;s async/await...I could go on, but I feel the point is made.<p>However...<p>It&#x27;s easy, when using .NET and Java, since they&#x27;re such &quot;batteries-included&quot; languages, to get into the mindset that &quot;I&#x27;ll never need another tool&quot;, which is _manifestly_ untrue. I am a committed polyglot programmer and I am appalled how frequently I encounter &quot;cultural ignorance&quot; within the big enterprise language communities. So I think the issue is more cultural (O&#x27;Church writes about this), one of trying to avoid &quot;Java Shop Politics&quot;, with the associated ManagerFactorySingletonImpls, needing to write about 100 lines to get a single thing done, etc. The problem is the cultural baggage that many enterprise developers bring with them, not the language itself.<p>In my current project, I&#x27;m doing small-program development in .NET for a Windows LOB project. It&#x27;s pretty refreshing. I get all the benefits of UNIX-style systems design, i.e.. small composable program elements, services, Git (TFS? are you kidding me?), proper CI/CD, and command-line automation, alongside the maturity of not having to deal with breaking changes on point releases of OSS libs, a thoroughly-documented, consistent BCL (.NET Framework 4.5), high-quality runtime, and generally less &quot;hipster&quot; culture.

This results in a lot of superfluous complexity that does not reflect the actual complexity of the problem domain. Another major problem is that purchasing tends to be based on feature check boxes instead of actual <i>evaluation of the product</i> by people who will <i>actually be using it</i>. You&#x27;d be surprised how often a large org will make a major purchase without even consulting with those who will actually be using the product.

Changes to Europe’s complicated copyright rules could force Google and other news aggregators to <i>pay European publishers to use their online content</i>. The Brussels policy makers are also likely to push for legislation to regulate online messaging services like WhatsApp... And the officials are also expected to announce new <i>investigations</i> into how American-owned online platforms like Uber, the ride-booking service, and Airbnb, the lodging website, operate in the region. Those inquiries might eventually <i>lead to legislation</i> aimed at helping European companies compete on a level playing field with their much-larger American competitors in the so-called sharing economy.<p>So instead of removing barriers and encouraging growth inside Europe, let&#x27;s put barriers to US companies, to &quot;level the playing field&quot;.<p>Any word about VATMOSS? I&#x27;d like to see a young (or even not so young) startup trying to figure out this mess of charging different tax rates across 28 different countries.

Those barriers also apply to non-EU companies by the way, but no sane small-company outside the EU is really going to bother. How is that for a level-playing field?<p>Or what about the cookie law? Yup. Let&#x27;s put a big warning sign on every site accessed in the EU. This will remove the barriers for sure.<p>And that&#x27;s even before we talk about localization into dozens of languages, or local / tax-specific regulations...<p>... and the examples on this article are also perplexing. Mobile phone roaming charges? (isn&#x27;t this old news?) access to Netflix?

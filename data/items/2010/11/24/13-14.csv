1937307,comment,1936870,1937011,0,0,elblanco,,,"I used it on a number of large collaborative projects (usually design documentation in the several hundred page variety) that needed reams of documentation and extensive side-bar discussion. Prior to Wave we used collaboration systems like Google Groups.<p>We'd break each project down into phases (and if necessary subphases) and create a Wave for each phase -- something like ""Phase A:Secondary Requirements and Permutations"". All of the assets for that phase would end up in the Wave with necessary meta-descriptions/discussions around each asset. As often as not the asset was just attached into the Wave, but we used a fair amount of links to Google Docs. The meta-discussions were usually descriptions of the asset, or directions/side-bar conversations between team members needed for coordination on that asset.<p>After all the phases were complete, we'd make another wave for final review and synthesis of the phase sub-documents, with sidebar discussions until final deliverable document.<p>The first Wave coordinated project we actually tried to fall back on Google Groups and email and it just made things messy and didn't really make sense. We bit the bullet on the second project and just did it all in Wave. You know what? The project ended up going stupid fast compared to a Groups/email solution. Instead of masses of junk filling up groups, and thousands of emails clogging up my mailbox (potentially getting lost in the masses of other email I get every day). Plus we got a nice historic record of everything for free. Essentially it took what would have been dozens or hundreds of hours of project coordination time and turned it to 0. It lubricated that aspect of the project coordination so my team could focus on just actually doing the project.<p>(and also, we used Wave notifiers so we knew when there was an update).",1290607169

It's <i>only</i> a tool for small project collaboration.<p>Here's our use: a new Wave for anything we need to talk about, which is its own subject (e.g., talking about a specific feature for a project.) In that wave, anybody who wants to say anything just adds more messages. For some things, the topmost Wave contains a ""summary"" of everything said. For example, we have a ""Schedule"" Wave where we write our schedule. The top Wave contains the actual schedule and is hand-edited whenever we need, and additional messages are added to discuss anything that needs discussing.<p>This is great for collaboration. Any time I want to add more information to a subject, I add a message. If there's something I need to edit (a list of clients, etc.), I can edit any Wave I want. It works perfectly with multiple people editing anything they want, even at the same time. It even works for real-time talking, which helps if you happen to be updating the Wave at the same time.<p>All in all, if you completely forget what Wave was supposed to be and <i>only</i> use it for small-team collaboration, I think it's a great tool.",1290606666

But since these people who the options were bought from presumably have contractual valuations of these options, it seems to me that there is no risk in the deal, except for the valuation at IPO of Facebook stock. Thinking of it, maybe it's the same as a 'regular' long, i.e. a non-naked one (I guess there's a real term for it ;) ) I originally had a mental comparison with naked longs in mind, in which case the risk profiles would deviate much more from the construction in the article; but yes if you compare it to a long on an asset someone already has, it may not be that different.<p>Then again it seems to be that the scary stories and the bad image of shorts and longs are about the naked variants, and that this is implicit in the article.

1937214,comment,1936909,1936937,0,0,nadam,,,"""the language designers perhaps could have used a bit more restraint in their design.""<p>The problem with that if they would follow your advice it would not be Scala anymore. There are dozens of programming languages which used more restraints in their design, but I've chosen Scala.\nThe reason is that I don't want to use different languages for different tasks unnecessarily. Scala is almost a no-compromise solution: statically typed, fast, concise, supports functional style where I prefer that and supports imperative style where I prefer that.\nI've been programming in Java for almost 10 years, and it was a no-brainer for me to switch to scala. This is the most important production language for me right now.\nThe only drawback is that it is not for beginners. It is for mature programmers. A beginner will be annoyed by the lot of information this book contains. But after lots of years of programming let's say in Java all the features in the language feels as a bless from god.<p>By the way the languae is not particularly complicated. Its language specification is someting like 200 pages while Java's language specification is something like 600 pages. The BNF syntax description of Scala is smaller than Java's. It contains fewer keywords. Scala is not more complicated than Java, rather it is deeper, and feel more complicated (espceially in the beginning.)",1290604174

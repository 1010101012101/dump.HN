Thanks for being upfront and geninue (imo).<p>I would certainly entertain the idea of working with you. I'm a 37signals kinda guy and roll with tha saas model. We can definitely get a feel for one another, but have to be honest and say, while I am not <i>opposed</i> to moving to Japan, its one of the super-huge obstacles that would make this <i>actually</i> working out quite a long shot, since what if we make it all the way to that point, it doesn't work out down the line, and I am out on my ass in Japan?? Hey wait ... that actually sounds really damned fun - Email is on the way!<p>P.S. Been seriously working on a pretty solid idea of my own, it should work just as well in Japan.. but I guess that's what the email is for!",1258195828

I expect it has less effect, and this article would have less votes if that's the only thing that identified the writer.<p>The same is true for comments... the author is included, but the username isn't given the same weight as the comment itself. And I think that's a good thing... we should keep it that way for comments and for articles.<p>To be fair, I also use the domain somewhat, though I use it more on Reddit to avoid sites like Alternet. The domain helps me avoid sites, but I don't think it has as much effect in helping me affirm sites.",1258195098

I tend to deal more with lower-level unixy technologies: TCP/IP, shell scripting, C++, servers, multi-threading, and so on. If somebody has the same general idea but needs my type of programmer, I'd love to hear from such a person.<p>(semi-off-topic: pg seems to frown on job postings here by non-yc companies. Not sure if this post qualifies as that. If this isn't welcome on the front page, I really wish there was some part of news.yc where this type of thing could go.)",1258194846

(And they didn't start life $80K in debt either.)<p>But I'd argue that college isn't about learning a trade, it's about getting more out of living life... and being part of your culture. So once the business is old enough to spare a few hours a day, college is a great idea.<p>I learned today that physicist Harold Fletcher (Bell Labs) helped get stereo recording off the ground back in the early 30s (with Stokowski; they made over a hundred recordings ... on dual-tracked vinyl).

941606,story,,,27,44,jason_tko,"Ask HN: I'm looking for a technical co-founder/partner.",,"I read HackerNews almost daily, and I always enjoy the articles and the discussions about startups, software and code.  So, I'm hoping that there might be a similarly minded HN reader out there who is looking for their next big thing.<p>As a preface, I've had a lot of software developed, but I've never worked full-time on software with a co-founder/partner.  Much of this is new to me, so I would definitely be open to comments or ideas about the way I'm performing this search from other members of HN, especially about the responsibilities I've listed below.<p>The Offer : In one sentence, I'm looking for someone to work with me to build a Software as a Service business based in Japan.  I'm experienced at IT sales, running a business and managing people.  I have a large network of contacts in Japan, and Webnet IT has a large 'built-in' active customer base that are interested in software that provides value to their operations.  Webnet IT is still my main operation, however I plan to spend a large portion of my time on this project once I find the right technical partner.<p>Here are some basic guidelines that are important to me :<p>- Skill Sets.   I am not a coder.  I have plenty of experience on the IT infrastructure side, and I've been running an IT business for 7 years, but I have no coding skills beyond basic scripts, basic PHP/MySQL and HTML.  I'm hoping to find someone who is passionate about coding, and has either the experience in creating SaaS systems, or the periphery experience and the ambition and ability to create this level of application.<p>- The Idea.  I have a number of ideas based on software I've developed and our customers requirements, but I'm open to discussion.  I see this as something we'd generate and agree on together.<p>- Personality and Capability.  I imagine we'll be spending a lot of time working together, and as a result, personality and attitude (and a sense of humour!) are paramount.  This goes both ways - you need to be comfortable and happy working with me.  I don't really mind about your background.  I don't place too much stock in degrees and certificates.  I'd be much more interested to hear about your personal software projects, your personal wins and your work experiences.<p>- Compensation. I'm open to ideas on compensation structures. If we get as far as discussing compensation, we can work out a fair and reasonable structure based on who you are, what you want, and what you can contribute.  Naturally, ""I want a large base and no revenue sharing or company percentages"" is a very different conversation from ""Give me a place to sleep and X% of the company"".<p>- How we work together.  I imagine that at the start, we'll discuss our ideas over Skype.  I'll show you examples of the software I've designed and developed, you'll do the same for me.  We'll put together a basic arrangement, and we'll do a couple of small projects to get an understanding of how we both work.  When this goes well, we'll see if we can agree on a basic product road-map.  If this goes well, we'll put together a plan to launch, detailing responsibilities and milestones.  By this stage, we should have an agreement in place.  Work begins.  Within a few months, we'll need to be spending a good amount of time working together.  As such, I'd like for you to be willing, happy and able to move to Japan.  As we get busier and as we acquire customers, I'd be hiring more developers and support staff, most likely working under you.<p>Bio : Like any relationship, or perhaps even more so, the co-founder/partner type relationship is based on trust and understanding.  As such, here is a brief biography to give you an understanding of who I am.<p>My name is Jason Winder, I'm Australian, I've been living in Japan for 8 years, and I run a business named Webnet IT that provides IT services to foreign companies in Japan.<p>Introduction : I was lucky enough to get a 2nd hand clunker computer when I was a kid.  For the technically curious, it was a x8086 with a green TV as a monitor, two 5.25 floppy drives, no hard disk and about 128K memory.  I grew up breaking, fixing and learning from this computer. From the experience gained from this PC over the years, I landed a job working for a large company out of high school.  I then found work at a smaller company in Australia, then I moved to Japan.  I worked for various IT companies for a couple of years, then I started my own company, Webnet IT.<p>Webnet IT : I didn't go to university, but I love learning.  I started from a blank slate in regards to entrepreneurship.  I've built up a consulting business by learning incrementally about business, sales and marketing.  During this process, I designed software and systems that automate mundane tasks, and assist us doing things like generating quotes, invoices, sharing information with our customers, and many other things. Through this process, I've discovered I have a passion for developing software that helps people perform complex tasks both simply and efficiently.  I'd like to build on this and develop useful software to sell to people.<p>Side note : My main PC these days is an Apple 15"" MacBook Pro. I built my home PC myself, it's an Intel Core2Duo 3.06GHz running Windows 7 with 2x24"" monitors.<p>You Would Be Responsible For<p>The technical and architectural infrastructure, Initially all coding, Eventually managing a small team of coders, Brainstorming ideas, and Creating a product roadmap with me.<p>I Would Be Responsible For<p>Sales and marketing, Funding, General hiring and Management, Accounting, Brainstorming ideas, and Creating a product roadmap with you.<p>I imagine these responsibilities will evolve over time, however I think it's important to do some initial general planning on expectations and responsibilities.<p>If this describes you and your situation, or if you have any comments or thoughts, I would be very happy to hear from you.  Please contact me at jason@webnet-it.co.jp.<p>Thanks for your time reading this.<p>Jason<p>tl;dr

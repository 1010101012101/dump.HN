4288704,comment,4287604,4287604,4,0,SuitAndThai,,,"The claims under ""Mass Production of Education"" are a little misguided:<p>1. Online education is not mass produced as he claims; the costs for every video that is downloaded to watch video lecture is incredibly small.  Popping up tutorials on YouTube with ads is profitable and sustainable, and that's really all you need for someone who can dedicate themselves to learning more about a topic.<p>2. I have no idea where he pulls his ""winners win"" suspicion.<p><pre><code>   > why wouldnt every student choose a Stanford or MIT education over, say, UNM?\n</code></pre>\nIf we have an open model of education, people would have the freedom of spending a minimal amount of time to look through a plethora of lectures and figure out what they like the best. In the end, you'll hear the best lecturers echoed from students who watched them. I'm making many assumptions here, and I don't want you to forgive me for making them.  But we can't overlook the assumptions that the author is making either, and there are a lot of them.<p>3. Supposedly, online education kills a personal connection: an argument that has been made many times. Maybe I should point to a popular counter-example: Khan Academy.  A very small group of people who manage to supplement the education of an incredible amount of people who want the extra help.  They do it for free.  They are happy with the results.  And the people they do it for are very happy with the results.  The argument he's making sounds like there's something to be yearned, but I don't buy it.<p>Were it not for this section and his rant on the ""Funding Climate"" (I really don't want to argue about politics here), I would not have thought this to be the rambling of an angry, old man.  He may have some valid points, but it's hard not to see this as a giant middle finger to his previous employer as well as venting now that he's at his new job.",1343173965

4288648,comment,4287697,4288222,8,0,snowwrestler,,,"This really shows a fundamental misunderstanding of not only the background of ""net neutrality"" regulation, but also of the very structure of the Internet itself.<p>In your analogy to a printing press, you've misplaced the Internet layer. Time Warner is not the ""printing press"", Hacker News is the printing press. Time Warner is UPS--shipping the pamphlets, periodicals, and books to the end users.<p>And in case you didn't know, shipping companies ARE regulated by the federal government in how they are allowed to decide what to carry. There is a set of rules called ""common carrier"" that specifies how shipping companies may advertise their rates, accept or decline customers, etc.<p>It's a legal system that dates back, in the U.S. at least, to before the railroads, when stage coaches and barges were the best means of getting pamphlets from one town to another. The goal of common carrier law is ensure that members of the public are treated fairly--so that UPS does not sign a side-deal with Barnes and Noble to ""accidentally"" deliver all of Amazon's books 4 days late.<p>This impetus for fair delivery is what is behind the push for net neutrality. Understand that without regulatory protection, it would be legal for Time Warner to (for example) sign a deal with Microsoft by which TW would deny passage of Linux files across the TW network. Or Verizon could sign a deal with Apple to block access to Google Play.<p>Now--the opponents to net neutrality make a very good point that generally speaking these sorts of things have not actually happened. So one could argue that a compelling need for net neutrality has not yet been demonstrated. But your analogy is flawed.",1343173131

Today, the most common iOS development target platform is still iOS 4. Using Parse your in-app purchase will be able to work for the customers who are not on the newest iOS platform.<p>2. Attaching metadata for products. At Parse a lot of our customers want to attach metadata information to products (categories, authors, genres, the publishing date, actors, etc) and to query products based on this information. You can imagine this is a very handy feature for an app that sells comic books. This is very natural to do on Parse because Parse offers a query-able, key-value data store. In fact, anyone, with or without technical background, would be able to use the data browser to add the metadata to the Product class.<p>3.

Google is doing some interesting stuff, but I don't think they're yet up to the peak of academia, like the amount of individual researcher freedom combined with innovation going on in the heyday of the MIT AI Lab. Even grad students were doing totally independent never-been-done research projects! Mere staff members like Richard Stallman had influential active side projects, too.<p>Google does seem like a great place if you're a senior enough researcher, though. People like Peter Norvig, Ken Thompson, and likely the author of this linked article, seem to get basically 100% freedom to work on whatever they want, with minimal management or job requirements, which is pretty much the ideal position to be in as a researcher. I suspect not all Google employees get Ken-Thompson-level freedom from having a boss, though.",1343172052

I'm certain that if Apple decided they were willing to pay $800K/year each + signing bonuses of $3 million dollars for a team of 4-5 share OS engineers, they could, in fact, resolve this. (I base the $800K on what top flight OS/Kernel consultants make - around $400/hour, plus the money you would need to pull them away from their stock/equity packages at whatever other company they were working at, sometimes known as a ""Make Whole"" package)<p>The problems with that, though, is that the average Apple Sofware/OS engineer makes around $200K/year (fully loaded) - so you would end up with a $600K (+signing bonus) disparity - which would be unfair to existing employees.<p>You can't increase the salaries of all similarly qualified engineers to $800K - that would mean increasing salaries of _all_ engineers - and Apple's R&D costs would skyrocket, and all their other salaries would be out of whack.<p>Sometimes, even though you can buy your way out of a situation, the peripheral costs of doing so are so great, that what seems to be only a $10million problem to solve, might up ending costing you hundreds of millions of dollars.<p>So - you suck it up, stay focussed, and do what you can with the people you have.<p>Of course, what _most_ companies do, is instead hire some average (or, often, below average) engineers to try and do the port - they muck it up, and they ship a crappy product.<p>Better to do fewer things better.

4288519,comment,4287604,4288426,5,0,_delirium,,,"I'm not sure it's <i>more</i> funding, as much as the way it's doled out. The idea with the way funding has shifted was indeed (in part) to make academia more ""real-world"" and competitive. Instead of a university getting a big block grant from the NSF, or researchers getting unrestricted funding directly from their university's budget, as used to be common, individual researchers apply for competitive 3-year grants to fund an individual project. In addition, researchers are increasingly expected to fund their students and student expenses (e.g. travel), whereas a larger percentage of that used to be funded by universities. Some of that (particularly at state universities) is outright decreases in funding for research, but some of it is just a change in how it's administered.<p>The idea, which was plausible, is that projects can then be judged on their merits, instead of one big slush fund that who knows what comes out of. But the unintended, if not unforeseeable side effect is that it adds a <i>huge</i> amount of extra overhead, and incentives to target only ""fundable"", aka ""sellable"" research. With NSF funding rates for projects currently running at 5-10% of proposals, and typical large research universities expecting you to have 1-3 of these 3-year grants going at any given time, you need to be submitting 10+ grant proposals a year! And ideally also working your networks to see if you can attract some corporate funding. That's a huge amount of overhead, and it also sucks a lot of the appeal from academia, since rather than the university setting giving you freedom, you're in some sense closer to an independent firm that has to bring in its own funding, constantly chasing the next round of financing lest your lab implode and students go hungry.<p>There are likely people who will thrive in that environment, but I think it's increasingly going to be people who are skilled at research management and sales. The #1 job is attracting external financing, and the #2 job is heading up a successful mini enterprise with that financing, ensuring the lab is operating well. This is becoming pretty close to explicit. One university I've been at now sends around an internal newsletter ranking faculty by number of dollars brought in so far this year! If that's what you're going to be judged on, why even be in academia?",1343171057

This is hurting readability, especially since the font is <i>already</i> bold. Essentially, you are applying a low-quality bold (generated by the browser or text rendering layer) to the high-quality bold that was designed by the typographer. This isn't just font wankery, it makes it hard to read the headings.<p>The easiest way to fix this is remove the bold declaration from your CSS. The text will still be bold, because you are using a bold font.<p>The other way to fix it is to go into your @font-face declarations for droid sans bold, and change the declared font-weight to be bold. This tells the browser that the font is already bold, and not to make it more bold.<p>Here's a before and after in FF (latest) on OS X.

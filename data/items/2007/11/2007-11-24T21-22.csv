I thought the same thing of del.icio.us, before yahoo bought it.<p>What are some startups/web apps that you think are really well executed?<p>Preferably new ones, not ones everyone knows about.",1195940085

The worst cases I've seen are family computers where the kids will click ""Yes"" or ""Allow"" to any message they get on IE (thanks to their Vista training), basically installing every piece of malware imaginable. Then their parents wonder why it's so slow and get 20 popups ""when they use the internet."" <i>sigh</i> That's why I recommend Macs.",1195940027

If you want to have good food too consider moving your startup to india - it costs around 60$/mnth for your own personal cook.

Wasn't it a joy? As if somebody had thought, hey I'll make a language for people to enjoy. No memory management! Yeah! No obscure macros! Just clean, beautiful code that everybody could immediately understand and nobody would shoot themselves in the foot.<p>We didn't think about how many times we would have to type getSomeField() { ... } and setSomeField(...) {...}. We didn't think about how entire frameworks, byte code manipulation weirdness, special purpose runtime containers, poorly integrated language extensions, etc would have to be written and deployed to overcome the metaprogramming deficiencies of Java. We were so glad to get rid of those breathtaking C++ compiler errors resulting from template crazyness that we didn't think about how statically typed languages really need type parameters. <p>For short, we didn't think about anything relating to the power of the language, we just felt joy and a big relief that the C++ curse had been taken from our souls, aching for harmony.<p>At least for myself I can say I'm not going to make that same mistake a second time. F..k harmony and joy! Let's switch our brains on before we jump onto the next language! I'll take a language war any day if it makes me think hard about how the features of a language behave once a system grows.",1195938609

(eg. they steal from you, continual - documented - bad performance etc. etc)<p>Now, it is always possible to render the relationship with the employee null and void by just stating that their services are no longer required and paying them the appropriate severance money. As an employer, you're also required to give two week's notice, but most give pay in lieu. Severance basically works out to 1 week's pay per year of service on top of that.<p>Most employers will give a little extra to stay out of legal tussles.",1195938255

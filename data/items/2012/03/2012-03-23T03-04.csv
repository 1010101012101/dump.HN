3743589,comment,3743231,3743231,1,0,arjunnarayan,,,"> As I see it, women are put off by brogrammer for two reasons. Some women would say that dichotomy of programmer and frat bro leaves women out altogether. If youre not a nerdy boy or a brogrammer, where do you fit in? Others see the brogrammer meme as taking the most masculine aspects of the discipline and emphasizing them (think chugging Red Bull, pumping iron, eating steak and getting women). Is this really what we should be doing when women are already so underrepresented?<p>I think the author is misreading the entire ""movement"" by first assuming the false dichotomy she stated, that I've quoted above: that computer science is for the two exclusive groups of ""nerdy boys"" and ""brogrammers"". First, the entire meme is mostly satire making fun of bros. Because, hey, easy targets, right?<p>Second, whatever serious brogrammers there are isn't out of nerdy guys coming out of the woodwork and embracing a culture of bro-ing. I know and socialize with a fair number of self-proclaimed ""bros"". Whatever non-satire based brogrammers exist, they come from a realization on the part of the bros-who-formerly-did-not-program --- that programming is a useful skill. So a lot of bros who previously took Econ classes and lined up for the investment banking recruiting sessions are now learning how to program and spending more time in the CS department.<p>I don't think this is something to be ""offended"" by. If what you're offended by is bro-culture (and yes, I will be the first to say that there are sometimes troubling things about a frat-culture that sometimes objectifies women --- the ""brogramming"" session cited where recruiters were trumpeting the existence of naked women at parties _is_ offensive.), then decry those bros that _do_ do things that marginalize various groups. But there are plenty of bros who do nothing worse than consume copious amounts of alcohol on friday night, play games of beerpong late into the night, wear popped collars, get excessive tans and lift a lot of weights (which is how I've met most of my bro friends, seeing as I do find some of those activities pleasurable). It's not all Mike-The-Situation out here, and you can empirically verify this fact by walking down Walnut Street on a Friday Night as the frat parties are in session.<p>But as a computer scientist who has all too often seen too many groups excluded from this beautiful subject --- I'm mostly troubled by this blogpost --- as it is an attempt to marginalize a group of different people (bros) who seem to have taken to learning more computer science. I want more bros in computer science. more women, more goths, more emos, more whatever-stereotype you have in mind. And if they want to brogram, let them.",1332474960

My best friend's cousin is from Long Island and he has cousins that call themselves ""guidos"" and intentionally live up to every Jersey Shore stereotype because they legitimately think it's cool.  My experience is only anecdotal, but I've yet to meet anyone who has actually used ""brogramming"" as a serious label for themselves.<p>My own personal theory is that there are two collective phenomenon at play here:<p>1) There's a self-cyclical force here where some people think brogramming <i>is</i> a label some people use non-ironically, so there are things like marketing materials developed specifically for it, which by definition will be exclusionary and sexist.  This material further spreads the idea that ""brogrammers are real"" and everyone gradually forgets that nobody is actually this ridiculous.<p>2) There is a fear among programmers that our wonderful merit-based community accepting of all genders, cultures, and creeds -- which it is, really -- is going to turn into Phi Delta Toolbag overnight.  For a lot of us, myself included, we've never been one of the ""cool kids"" and found computers and technology a much better fit for our introverted personalities.  And suddenly these pink popped-collared polo shirt sunglass-wearing monsters are going to <i>take that away from us.</i><p>Anyway, I understand why the women at UPenn would be offended by the ""brogrammer"" term, sometimes you just don't want to be associated with a term even if it's satirical.

Or maybe he'd bring her along, and someone would make a comment like, ""guess it's not 'boys' night' this week, ha ha, I guess some girls like football too"" thus calling attention to her sex and re-emphasising that she's weird and exceptional.<p>As soon as you take a bunch of friends hanging out---which is, at least presumptively, not a sexist activity---and slap a gendered label on it like ""boys' night"", or ""brogramming"", you know what?

The tooling and knowledge needed to get a basic proof of concept app up and running from scratch is trivial with Knockout.  It fits into whatever toolchain or build process you already have; as a result it's easy to add Knockout to an existing Django or Node project.<p>By contrast, Ember has poor documentation and tutorials.  This was especially bad at launch, but even today it's very limited, and significant chunks still refer to Sproutcore.  Some of that documentation is apparently still relevant, refers to the Sproutcore v2 project, and just haven't been updated with the new name.  Other bits are apparently referring to the Sproutcore v1 project, and aren't relevant.  Good luck figuring out which ones are which.  Ember also has very idiosyncratic ideas about how projects should be built; again this isn't really documented.  It's <i>hard</i> to build an Ember app from scratch, and it probably will <i>not</i> work with your current build process.  It feels, in some difficult to define fashion, more like what I'd expect from the Java ecosystem.  I'm not a fan.<p>As I said, I'm sure that sound unfair, and it may well be.  Ember fans will no doubt be able to explain that it's much easier than that, that my problems were all my own fault, that the documentation is already much improved, and that any quirks that do exist do so for very good historical reasons.  And they're probably right!  But I came at Ember cold a month or two ago, tried very hard to figure it out, and bounced.  As a result, I have no idea how Ember really compares to Knockout, because I figured out how to write my app in Knockout, but I couldn't figure out how to write it in Ember despite a very concerted effort.  Take that for what it's worth.  :)<p>(My impression, incidentally, is that Knockout is sort of what the Ember project wants to be, but they're still struggling to strip out the cruft they inherited from Sproutcore.  Both projects have a focus on magical ""it just works"" dynamic bindings, which means you have <i>incredible awesome power</i> but have to be a little careful not to blow your leg off via some behind-the-scenes magic you didn't even realize existed.  Backbone, on the other hand, is a very barebones framework; it's almost more like a toolkit you can use to build your <i>own</i> MVC framework.  That's valuable too, depending on your needs.)",1332474031

You have to go to five or ten different sites to get news on something. Say you want to know whats hot today on startup. You may visit Hacker News, TechCrunch and the Next Web to get information on them. You do that daily. But say you are interested in JRuby or Ruby. Where would you go to get hot news on them? Yes you can be seeing content in sub-redits or you can go to a mailing list which talks about it. But you may miss out on news around Ruby in other websites.<p>So whats the problem here? We do not have a website which allows us to get content from all other websites and categorize them. So how this web site should work? Here is an attempt from us to solve this very problem.  We call it - News Problem.<p>This web site should have the following:<p>It should be an aggregator of various web sites. It should allow the user to follow one or more topics that he is interested in. it should somehow know how to categorize content from other website and then deliver it to the user.<p>This was the requirement that was there.  And guess what two programmers would do about it? Yeah code the ass out to get a service like this.<p>So what we did from last summer?<p>We (Vinod and I) like to work with each other and we have built over time a micro blogging site - ScoopSpot. So we thought, let us use ScoopSpot as a platform to get the news problem solve. So we started off.<p>Problem #1: We need a list of web sites which we want to get news from.<p>We love to visit several web sites, like Hacker News, TechCrunch etc. So we actually have had a list. Also we felt that to keep our web site clean there should be a minimum editing required about web sites to crawl.<p>Problem #2: How can we get the content?<p>This problem is already solved with RSS feeds. So we built a RSS feed reader which would crawl the web sites periodically.<p>Problem #3: How do we define topic?<p>We needed a way to define the concept of topics in our web site. We choose to define it as tag.  We added the functionality to follow a tag. We already had following people, so it was natural next move.<p>Problem #3: The big one  how the hell we know which content belongs where?<p>This where we have worked hard of late. We needed a system which can read an article and automatically tags them. We had to build a system which understands English, also a battery of statistical methods were built to get to know what the tags in an article are. We have got some success with this approach  we are not saying that we have solved it completely, there are still work going on  to reduce the false positives.
So we now have a system which gives us news about a lot of favorite topic to us.  Here are some links with tag names:<p>Ruby:  http://www.scoopspot.com/ruby<p>Startup: http://www.scoopspot.com/startup<p>Music: http://www.scoopspot.com/music<p>If you would like to try out ScoopSpot please login with your Google/Faceboo/Yahoo id.

3743431,comment,3742061,3743242,2,0,padwiki,,,"1) There have been a few different experiments with self pacing and retention at schools like Oxford (and a college in Iowa of all places). The typical result is a significant increase in retention with lower stress. The problem, and fundamental reason why this isn't the norm, is simple logistics. Trying to build a serial system of education that still uses classrooms is massively difficult. The closest you can get is a compromised 6 week class system that is still extremely difficult to pull off. Parallel is just easier and more cost effective to administer. It's also easier and more cost effective to administer on an online system which is why the push for MOOC. The difference for us is that we care more about optimizing the learning process itself and real evaluation and guidance, and are willing to bet that enough students also care about those points to give us a chance at proving it at a large scale. Our system costs a little more than free, sure, but the difference in results can be dramatic, as you are seeing with your masters program.<p>I don't have the 7% study at hand, but I'll try to look through my list of references to see if I can track it down. They cover some statistics on retention in this article: <a href=""http://www.wired.com/medtech/health/magazine/16-05/ff_wozniak?currentPage=all"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.wired.com/medtech/health/magazine/16-05/ff_woznia...</a><p>As for in-major hours, it may vary a bit by school (and MIT has a higher percentage than most), but here is the breakdown for UT. In-major credits required for a CS bachelors: 45. Average credits per class: 4. Weeks in a semester: 14. Average classes per week: 3. Total estimated lecture hours per class: 42ish. Total in major lecture hours for 45 credits: about 500. Subtract intro days, quiz and final days plus time for class to get settled, etc.. and you have somewhere around 400-450 hours left, or 100 per year, 2 per calendar year week or 3.5 per school year week. Some semesters you might not have any in major, some you might have 2 or 3, so remembering 8 hours in a week of classes is not outside of the data set.<p>2) A student should not have to know the exact set of skills necessary to build up to the higher level concepts. This is one of the problems with the self directed learning attempts in traditional schools. But, if the student has a clear end goal in mind (say, the goal of becoming a search engineer at Google), then a JIT system that can build a sequence of courses based on the concepts within the course is more effective and targeted than a standardized fire-hose curriculum. Speaking of fire-hose, I'm working on a post covering context switching in a parallel educational system that addresses exactly why this is such a problem.<p>3) This comes back around to the top down (or goal oriented) approach, and gets even more interesting with a mentor guided approach. Imagine a hybrid apprentice/mentor system where the mentor can define a sequence (or collection) of high level concepts which the learning system could then take and generate a path to master those concepts. All the while, the mentor could provide direct guidance and assistance where needed and help answer the tough questions that arise without having to dedicate all their time to the actual instruction. There are many, many, variations on this pattern that work extremely well with JIT systems but really don't work at all in JIC.",1332471790

3743429,comment,3743231,3743231,-4,0,temphn,,,"Let's start with some facts.<p>FACT: Men and women have significant, measurable neurological differences[1].<p>FACT: These differences are measurable before birth[2].<p>FACT: Men and women show large, reproducible differences <i>on average</i> in tests of visuospatial ability, differences that can be mapped back to the brain[3]<p><pre><code>  Men consistently outperform women on spatial tasks, 
  including mental rotation, which is the ability to 
  identify how a 3-D object would appear if rotated in 
  space. Now, a University of Iowa study shows a connection 
  between this sex-linked ability and the structure of the 
  parietal lobe, the brain region that controls this type of 
  skill.

  The parietal lobe was already known to differ between men 
  and women, with women's parietal lobes having 
  proportionally thicker cortexes or ""grey matter."" But this 
  difference was never linked back to actual performance 
  differences on the mental rotation test.

  ...

  ""Differences in parietal lobe activation have been seen in 
  other studies. This study represents the first time we 
  have related specific structural differences in the 
  parietal lobe to sex-linked performances on a mental 
  rotation test,"" said Tim Koscik, the study's lead author 
  and a graduate student in the University of Iowa 
  Neuroscience Graduate Program. ""It's important to note 
  that it isn't that women cannot do the mental rotation 
  tasks, but they appear to do them slower, and neither men 
  nor women perform the tasks perfectly.""

There are literally thousands more studies of the deep rooted genetic, neurological, and endocrinological differences between the genders on pubmed.org. These differences manifest before birth. And this research is what your tax dollars pay for. It is just young earth creationism to postulate that evolution did not happen, or that biological gender differences do not exist or are somehow disconnected from their real world consequences.<p>One of the consequences is that in any niche which requires cognitive or physical activity, we should not expect an exactly 50/50 distribution of males and females. Interests differ. Abilities differ.<p>The religious outcry against stating these basic evolutionary facts got Larry Summers ousted as the President of Harvard in 2005. You simply cannot state these facts and retain your job. And the irony of all ironies is that those who drove the President of Harvard from power will insist that they are actually the oppressed, rather than the powerful.<p>That's the root of the matter here. The ostensible evil of the term ""brogrammer"" rests upon the tacit desirability of having a 50/50 distribution of women in programming, which in turn rests upon the presumption that it is even possible to <i>achieve</i> this equality given biological constraints, constraints that are obvious upon a cursory skim of the relevant literature. We are just not blank slates to be blasted clean and remade by ideology.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Female-Brain-Louann-Brizendine-M-D/dp/0767920090"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Female-Brain-Louann-Brizendine-M-D/dp/...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2009-10/uu-spb102309.php"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2009-10/uu-spb102309....</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2008-12/uoi-sdo121708.php"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2008-12/uoi-sdo121708...</a>",1332471783

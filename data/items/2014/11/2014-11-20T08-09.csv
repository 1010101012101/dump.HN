8634895,comment,8633727,8634662,0,0,ridiculous_fish,,,"I worked on resolution independence on OS X over a period of years. I think the above comment is not made with full appreciation of the difficulty of the problem. Supporting arbitrary resolutions well is very difficult.<p>The underlying frameworks (e.g. CoreGraphics) are absolutely capable of rendering at arbitrary resolutions, and have been for a long time. It&#x27;s not particularly hard: you interpose an affine transform which converts from local to device coordinates, apply it to all your geometry, and it falls out.<p>But &quot;rendering at arbitrary resolutions&quot; is not the same as &quot;looks good at arbitrary resolutions.&quot; For example, a line 1 px wide at 1x will be 1.5 pixels wide at 1.5x. That means at least one edge must be aligned on a partial pixel, and there&#x27;s the potential for weird antialiasing effects. There&#x27;s also a behavior change: you cannot redraw half a pixel, so now &quot;dirtying&quot; a pixel requires redrawing more components at 1.5x than at 1x, which can cause performance problems and other bugs. And there&#x27;s also a question of which pixels get the partial alignment: do you round in a direction? If so, which one? Or maybe you don&#x27;t round and you have two pixels that are a quarter covered?<p>Which leads to the problem of centering. I wish to center a bitmap image within a button&#x27;s border. The image is 101 logical points high, and the border is 200 logical points high. With a 2x scale factor, I can center absolutely, and still be aligned to device pixels. With a 1x, 1.25, 1.33, etc. scale factor, centering will align me on a partial pixel, which looks like crap. So I have to round. Which way? If the goal is &quot;make it look good,&quot; then the answer is &quot;whichever way looks good,&quot; which depends on the visual style of the bezel, i.e. whether the top or bottom has more visual weight. So now we need hinting.<p>And that&#x27;s where things start to get really nasty. In order to make things look good at arbitrary resolutions, we want to round to device pixels. But the rounding direction is not a local question! Consider what happens if we have two visual elements abutting in logical coordinates, and they round in opposite directions: now there&#x27;s a device pixel between them. That&#x27;s very visible: you get a pixel crack! So you have to coordinate rounding.<p>WPF is a good example of a framework that attempted resolution independence and encountered this problem. Initially it has the &quot;SnapsToDevicePixels&quot; property, which triggers rounding behavior at draw time. But draw time is too late, because of the &quot;abutting elements rounding in opposite directions&quot; problem. So they introduced the &quot;UseLayoutRounding&quot; property, which does...something. And the guidance is basically &quot;turn it on and see if it helps, if not, disable it.&quot; Great.<p>The web also has this problem in spades. Websites break in all sorts of fun ways when you zoom in or out. We tolerate this because, frankly, the bar is super-low for websites.<p>As I see it, the two options are:<p>1. Make everything vectors. You&#x27;ll have to choose between weird antialiasing artifacts and potential pixel cracks; either way things will look bad. And you&#x27;ll encounter bitmaps eventually, and have to deal with the necessities of resampling and pixel aligning at that point.
2. Scale only to integral sizes, and resample. You&#x27;ll avoid antialiasing and pixel alignment issues, but pay a performance penalty, and things may look slightly blurry.<p>So which option is better? #1 has the potential for the highest-quality output, but at a significant price: developers must test their apps at more scale factors, and the failure mode is ugly drawing artifacts or outright bugs. #2 is more utilitarian: the output is not as nice, and you incur a perf penalty, but that&#x27;s borne by the system instead of the apps, and the overall system is more consistent. #2 is also more forward looking: if you expect that pixel densities will continue to increase, then resampling artifacts will eventually be indiscernible, but a pixel crack will always be visible.<p>Apple took the practical and forward-looking approach to this problem. I can&#x27;t fault them: to my knowledge, nobody has successfully implemented true resolution independence in a framework with wide adoption. If they have, I&#x27;d love to know how!",1416473995

8634891,comment,8634037,8634622,0,0,williamcotton,,,"If a business makes spark plugs and sells them to stores it knows exactly how much it costs to make the product and how much the stores are willing to pay. These direct connections between inputs and outputs allow for effective price discovery.<p>However with Facebook and Twitter there is no pricing mechanism between what a user is worth and how much a user costs.<p>This is a general issue for any business that subsidizes operation costs with advertisements. Television and radio rely on outside ratings firms and market research companies to operate efficiently. TV and radio are passive experiences and advertisements are generally effective for certain kinds of products. The TV and radio stations are incentivized to make great content for both their audience and their advertisers.<p>Google AdSense has a fully functional marketplace where advertisers bid for keywords. This works because people use search engines to, well, search for things. A lot of the time they&#x27;re searching for things they want to buy. The better the search results, the better the value for both the advertiser and the user.<p>People don&#x27;t go to Facebook or Twitter to search or to buy things. They go there to communicate, to reference, publish and browse media, and to establish an identity.<p>They&#x27;re fighting their users at every step. Their only course of action is to own their customers data and control their actions and identity.  They cannot offer privacy to their users because they need to sell that information to marketers. They can&#x27;t let 3rd parties have equal access to their users data and identity. They&#x27;ve got to control and restrict 3rd party clients. They rely on artificial scarcity.<p>This hurts both users and advertisers. These inefficiencies and misaligned incentives are passed on to both parties. It makes for a less effective marketing platform. It also makes for a worse product for users by interfering and adding noise to their communications.<p>The majority of Twitter&#x27;s product was developed by outsiders. Retweets and hash tags are the result of a community of users and developers in control of their own evolution.<p>However, since the only way for Twitter to make money was to &quot;just slap some ads on it&quot;, they had to have asymmetric read and write privileges.<p>That means they have to try and replicate the same kind of evolutionary product but with a limited number of internal and very expensive designers and developers. And again they&#x27;re not incentivized to provide value for their users. They&#x27;re incentivized to extract value.<p>Neither Facebook nor Twitter make content. They just provide the service of storing and organizing an ungodly amount of information. This is definitely a very valuable service. The problem is that it is a service much like how electricity is a service. It makes about as much sense to give out free energy and then &quot;just slap some ads on it&quot; as it does for these companies to give out free communication channels and then fill them with noise.<p>The store that sells spark plugs has customers. The spark plug manufacturer has customers. Their suppliers have customers. They know who wants what, how much they&#x27;re willing to pay, and how to advertise to them.<p>Facebook and Twitter have users. The only customers in the equation are the advertisers. They have no idea how much their users are willing to pay and they have no idea how much their users are worth. They price ads based on what must amount to voodoo projections of their operation costs and a blind balancing act of signal-to-noise.",1416473839

I find the ads extremely effective if you know what you&#x27;re doing and target the right demographics.  That being said, the conversion thing makes total sense.  There&#x27;s lots of little tricks that have worked like make a campaign with over $100/day on ads and you get prioritized over the little fish and then lower it right away so you&#x27;re still prioritized in their display algo but you aren&#x27;t spending at that amount.  If your adspend really is 100 start it higher like 1000.  Lots of little tricks you can do that will tweak the system to your advantages.  but buy paying for likes or showing ads to people who like candy crush or &quot;insert corporate page&quot; you&#x27;ll probably burn at over a dollar a click to your site and most of those will bounce hence leaving an ineffective campaign.<p>The thing is though even if it&#x27;s slightly working it&#x27;s probably cheaper then AdWords, so for larger budgets/non personal it&#x27;s a great way to get the same amount and comparably the same targeted traffic for less capital.<p>Also if the ads are so horrendous please explain the numerous ad hackers that have done TeeSpring campaigns making 100k by targeting niche at scale.

We take different storage/memory technologies, sort them by their speed and price, put the fastest but most expensive closest to the CPU and the slowest but cheapest as far as possible. Minimizing memory footprint allows us to do more work on the faster end while minimizing storage cost allows us to store terabytes of data on your bookshelf.<p>There might have been just two or three levels initially: cpu register(s), system ram, and external storage. Now the spread has several more steps: registers, L1 cache, L2 cache, maybe L3 cache or part of memory as disk cache, SSD (either as a standalone drive or as an on-disk cache inside a traditional hard drive), and the good old spinning platter. We&#x27;ve mostly let go of tape storage by now but those are still sold for their capacity.<p>However, from the programmer&#x27;s point of view, nothing has necessarily changed.<p>We have several levels of storage, more than before, ranging from the fastest on-chip cache ram to the mechanical storage and we still optimize our programs to run mostly in the fastest tip of this memory pyramid. What has changed is the size of the spread itself: the gap between the fastest and the slowest is huge in numbers. But relatively, not so much.<p>A quick guesstimate of the ratio of microseconds needed for a zero-page read in C64 vs. reading a byte from the 1541 floppy drive versus a read from cpu cache vs. a read from a spinning platter tells that the relative difference still roughly on the same order of magnitude. From various sources, I get a figure between 50-100 million times faster between the fastest and slowest read.<p>That is also what makes programming so much fun: everything gets redone all the time and the pace of advancements is crazy yet some things don&#x27;t change.

One of the guests invited a tabloid reporter, did not appear to disclose the terms of the invitation to this person, and the result is predictable.<p>The ethical nuances here are lost because you have a sketchy company and an ethically challenged publication.<p>But in the same vein as the Mozilla incident, freedom of the press, nor freedom of speech...does not protect a citizen from another citizen.<p>If a muck-raking journalist wants to hide behind ethics to keep citizens from muck-rakin them, that&#x27;s simply not protected by law or frankly by any real ethical consideration, other than the sense of moral proportionality that reflects their own behaviour.<p>It is a bizzarre point, but unfortunately its fundamentally correct.<p>The only &quot;new&quot; ethical consideration in this flap has to do with using specific information (presumably confidential company information) to bolster an attack.  From what i&#x27;ve read, nobody suggested that this type of attack was only possible using a certain set of information.<p>Notwithstanding the distastefullness here, this is simply nothing that is not done in every major national election. So in that regard, the senator could equally send such a complaint to the DNCC.<p>What is actually the legitimate issue here is something much narrower: whether or not a malicious person would have the potential to abuse information that is not publicly available to do this.<p>That is very much a legit issue, but I&#x27;d be interested to see if the actual discussion would have been so bizaerre as to require this formulation. That would bring the company and its policies into the actual discussion in a way which simply articulating that low ethical standards swing both ways does not.<p>For example, a malicious threat would be something along the lines of &quot;I know where you were last weekend at xx:xx&quot; where this information would be used to extort or blackmail someone (eg, an affair etc). This type of threat would specifically hinge on the abuse of private information. Whether or not this was somehow allowed under any user agreement or employee policy is beside the point--its blatantly an abuse of implicit trust.<p>That is an entirely different type of situation that saying if &quot;reporter X&quot; is unethica, someone might very well do the equivalent of a classified-security clearance review of &quot;reporter X&quot; and articulate the findings in public. [1]<p>Needless to say, most people that look at this cannot distinguish the two cases, or if they can they are happy to disregard the reality of how the world works already.<p>The second issue is the idea of proportionality. In that when faced with some level or argument or counter argument, you dis-repscet the process of discourse and engage in ad-hominem. That is to say, in this case, retaliation with character assasination.<p>Again, I think this cuts both ways here. Being tone deaf and lacking in porportionality is a problem for ethically challenged startups--not doubt--but its also a problem with tabloids (see: uk phone hacking) and social media lynch mobs.<p>[1] If it meets the test of being legal and <i>proportionate</i>, its not really unethical by default.",1416471148

Turning Go into something like Java or C++ will make it not Go any more.<p>> We didn&#x27;t build Go in order to have arguments on a mailing list.<p>Not sure many popular languages were built for that. But arguments on mailing lists is what you get. Quite often the smarter people are, the better they are able to veil things like disappointments, personal dislikes, and others in technical arguments.

8317319,comment,8315996,8317077,3,0,nknighthb,,,"My criteria for magic is basically &quot;this is difficult for the average developer to reason about the behavior of&quot;. With the exception of garbage collection (with the &quot;asterisk&quot; I mentioned), the things you listed are minimal abstractions which are very easy to reason about.<p>We all understand how maps, slices, channels, and goroutines work. Their behavior is simple and mostly predictable. Developers working in C wrote these or analogous systems all the time. Over and over again, albeit commonly with subtle errors, particularly with regard to concurrency.<p>Slices and maps (or their close equivalents) are universal. They exist in a generic form in Go because everybody needs them, in pretty much every significant codebase. There aren&#x27;t many other data structures for which that is true. Perhaps as importantly, many nontrivial codebases don&#x27;t really need much in the way of other data structures.<p>Concurrency features are less universal, but are also the source of many critical bugs. One might reasonably say concurrency is inherently magic under my criteria, but unfortunately some form of it is unavoidable. Go&#x27;s concurrency primitives at least make it easier to avoid common errors while minimizing additional magic.<p>My personal problem with adding generics directly to Go is not that they are magic, exactly (which I think you may have misinterpreted georgemcbay&#x27;s comment to imply), but that they lead easily to magic. Go discourages overengineering, which is a common outcome of certain people applying generics (and there are a lot of those certain people, and I&#x27;ve had the misfortune to deal with their code throughout my career).<p>What I would like is for something like gen to become the de-facto standard (presumably in conjunction with the generate feature proposed for Go 1.4). I doubt if I&#x27;d use it much myself, but that outcome would at least placate demands for generics without making it all that easy to obfuscate what is actually going on in the Go code.",1410756404

I&#x27;ve been doing JS development since long before I found ruby.  Just some thoughts on it I had been working on for a blog post:<p>In web development today, JavaScript gets to be the default language by virtue of being in the browser. JavaScript is a very good language, but it has a lot of warts. (See <a href=""http://wtfjs.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://wtfjs.com/</a> for some great examples) Some of these can introduce bugs, others are just difficult to deal with. JavaScript was rushed to market quickly and standardized very quickly. Ruby was used by a small community for years while most of the kinks were worked out. Ruby also has some great concepts such as uniform access, mixin&#x27;s, duck typing, and blocks to name a few. While many of these features can be implemented in JavaScript in userland, few are standardardized and the solutions are seldom eloquent.<p>Uniform access and duck typing provides us with the ability to make reactive objects that have the exact same interface as a normal object. This is a big win, nothing new to learn to do reactive programming.<p>--<p>Also, just as a side note, Opal does a great job of compiling ruby to JS.  The code is easy to understand, supports source maps so chrome for example can bring up your ruby code in the console and show line numbers in the ruby code.  While many gems won&#x27;t work without some porting, a lot do.  Opal currently runs rspec (a very complex ruby project) with only a few patches.

Substitution matrices[0] describe how likely it is for an amino acid to mutate into another amino acid. However, they are generalized descriptors. At the same time, PWMs[1] describe how the probability of any given variant (mutation) is in a specific sequence, and are created by analyzing all known homologs (similar sequences) of that sequence.<p>However, the number of mutations required for a virus which is incapable of becoming airborne is probably large and definitely unknown. I&#x27;m not an expert in virology, but I believe that there are two requirements for a pathogen to become airborne:<p>A. It must infect and replicate in an area of the body capable of generating aerosols (generally, the respiratory system, like Influenza and Tuberculosis).<p>B. It must be good at surviving in aerosols- I believe this requires specific environmental adaptations and the right surface proteins and sugars.<p>I believe that Ebola meets neither requirement (especially the first), and you could see how meeting both would require not just large physical adaptation, but also a complete change in the virus&#x27; life cycle in the host.<p>>And then let&#x27;s say someone wanted to cause mutations that would make it airborne. Could they do it?<p>I think in general it would be easier to start with an airborne virus, and make it deadlier.

Lack of generics has bothered me a little, but copy and paste with a multiple-cursor editor really makes short work of it. I think the worst part is really our natural aversion to code duplication and the ugliness of it. e.g. having to write min/max for integers is pretty ugly (although not as ugly as converting your ints to float64 and using the stdlib min/max.) However, I spent more time thinking that it was ugly than writing min and max. Sure it&#x27;s ugly, but programming is not art, it&#x27;s engineering, and Go is a language for engineers.",1410754358

But even with this said, I think I get your point (I&#x27;m going off on a tangent). My opinion on the matter; All bets are off when it comes to state/country funded attackers. These are the organizations that lead me to my &quot;nothing is ever 100% secure&quot; conclusion. What we&#x27;ve seen insinuates that these level of attackers have access to information and capabilities that your average attacker probably does not have (example; vendor back-doors, compromised certs/keys, black rooms, etc). Unfortunately for us, these do a very good job subverting the current implementation of infrastructure security (which for the most part, is/was designed based on certain levels of trust that may no longer exist).

We believe that violence and more money are the only effective solutions to every single problem the world faces.  Original thinking just doesn&#x27;t happen.<p>A creative solution would be to temporarily halt all regulations on anti-ebola drug development and let them experiment on any willing person in Liberia who wishes to receive treatment.  The example of Banting and Best in the 20s is a great example of the enormous progress that can be accomplished if there is no regulation on medicine.  These guys came up with the idea for extracting insulin from animals and injecting it into humans.  They tested it out on willing patients, the first being a 14 year old, released the invention for use by the public and won the Nobel prize in the span of 3 years (1921-1923).  That speed of drug development and testing is impossible today.<p>A good analogy of the present situation would be this.  Someone is drowning in the river.  You can use the military to prevent him from knocking any nearby bathers into the river as he floats down stream but don&#x27;t you dare throw him  something handy like a branch or a quickly improvised flotation device because that might help him float and it may not work and there would be lawsuits or regulatory violations!

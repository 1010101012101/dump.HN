But the limit should be lowered now.<p><i>Weight minimums are good for keeping a level playing field by keeping the cost to entry &quot;low&quot; by keeping it to the thousands.</i><p>There are no bikes in the in the World Tour peleton that retail for under $10,000. You can easily build a sub 6.8kg bike for that.<p><i>They&#x27;re also good for safety reasons, both for the rider and others they might crash into; there&#x27;s no incentive to try to cut too much weight in a way that could impact safety if there&#x27;s a weight floor anyway.</i><p>There&#x27;s some truth in that, but the limit is way, way lower than where it is at the moment. The fact that weights are being added to push bikes over the limit has no safety impact.",1454234388

Most riders have their own coach or trainer, and the national team only rides together for a few times a year.<p>For example, Lance Armstrong&#x27;s &quot;coach&quot; Chris Carmichael (notoriously) had little to do with his training (Michelle Ferrari developed his training programs). Carmichael probably knew about his drug use, but it&#x27;s likely there are plenty of other similar cases where a national coach had even less contact.<p>&quot;National Coach&quot; is often more akin to a manager/selector role.<p>Notably, in this case her father was her trainer.

However, I ended up getting a pebble because sometimes I volunteer or work events where I work with a team that coordinates via messaging, and managing literally hundreds of msgs a day is vastly easier with a smart watch.<p>While my plan was to only wear it during events I decided recently to try wearing it all the time. But I switched to using a &quot;nato band&quot;, and that&#x27;s made a tremendous difference. I regularly wear a watch every waking hour and it&#x27;s not at all uncomfortable. Maybe eventually I&#x27;ll grow weary of it, but so far it&#x27;s been fine.",1454233569

Batteries in the watch face as well as throughout the entire wristband.  Just cram it with all that modern crap but make it look and function like a watch that an actual normal person wouldn&#x27;t be embarrassed to wear.  A smartphone with everything except for that obnoxious screen.<p>If that existed, consumers could pick and choose from an infinite buffet of accessory devices that are purely designed for user interaction, while leaving the connectivity and processing up to your headless wrist-mounted computer, which one again, isn&#x27;t a complete embarrassment to wear.<p>Your &quot;smartphone&quot; should just be a screen for your wrist computer.  Your laptop should just be a bigger screen for your wrist computer, with a keyboard that&#x27;s also just an input device for your wrist computer.  Your television is just a really big screen for your... You get the idea.  Good news: you don&#x27;t even have to own a crappy proprietary IR-based remote that you&#x27;ll inevitably lose, because your TV UI exists on the handheld &quot;smartphone&quot; screen that passes data to the big screen via the watch computer.<p>Your wrist computer would have awesome battery life because it&#x27;s not powering an LCD screen and the whole device can just be packed with batteries.  Notice how the Pebble&#x27;s battery life puts the Apple Watch to shame, and it could be even better without any screen at all.  I have a Withings Activite and the battery lasts for months, even though it has bluetooth and a haptic motor.<p>Your wrist computer can be upgraded and you can still have compatibility with all of your same accessories, giving you the freedom to upgrade each device piecemeal.  Drop your handheld &quot;phone&quot; screen in the toilet?  Good thing it was just an LCD panel with a WiDi chip so it only cost 100 bucks, and you didn&#x27;t lose any phone numbers despite not having cloud backup.<p>Bottom line:  Everyone is trying to make the smartwach work as some kind of pale shadow of a smartphone that has a worthless interface, a garbage battery life, and doesnt even functuon as a decent timepiece.  Even with all that, you still have to have a smartphone to make it a functional device.  As long as tech manufacturers continue to follow that strategy, the smartwach will continue to be an abysmal failure.<p>Everyone&#x27;s been looking for the &quot;smartphone killer&quot; and they&#x27;re hoping it&#x27;s the smartwach.  It will be, but only once we actually let the smartphone die.  What does the iPhone 6s / Galaxy [whatever] offer over the iPhone 5 / Galaxy [whatever - 3]?  Nothing.  Maybe some new color options.  Webpages started scrolling smoothly on phones about 3-4 years ago,and since then its been a wasteland of innovation.  We&#x27;re at the &quot;look how many cupholders we have&quot; phase of smartphone advancement.<p>It&#x27;s plain that the future is one device, always on your person, impossible to lose, one unified OS, and with an infinite ecosystem of compatible auxiliary interfaces.  If the tech giants don&#x27;t already have their engineers working toward this vision, they should feel shame.<p>Why does it even have to be a watch?  How much processing power and battery life could you stuff into a subtle, tasteful belt?  Nobody has any vision.",1454233517

11005826,comment,11004659,11005576,0,0,fishnchips,,,"I don&#x27;t think it is a bad language but I think it sometimes introduces unnecessary complexity: custom getters and setters on properties, will-set/did-set blocks and operator overriding (including precedence and associativity). Also, coming from a background where pointers are an obvious thing I do not understand why classes and structs need to be separate data types. None of these things is a bad per se but I do think they make the learning curve steeper and invite some level of abuse. Reminds me a lot of C++.",1454232121

The turnaway rate is probably closer to zero given that at-capacity restaurants are unlikely to run these deals. While the redemption rate is not ultimately factored in, it should be pointed out that Groupon has cleverly finessed the issue by making ""expired"" Groupons worth their paid value.<p>Finally, we should begin to take into account that deal economics are beginning to change in the merchant's favor.

They ""only"" take 35% for books sold in such countries AND priced below $9.99.<p>You may think that $22.79 is a magical number they pulled out of their asses. But multiply $22.79 * 30% and you get $6.84.<p>If they priced it $9.99, they'd get $9.99 * 65% which is $6.49. So less royalties for the publisher.<p>Now... at $9.99 the book would certainly sell more copies. However, if you consider all the copies sold outside of the selected territories will have 35% royalty regardless of how low the price is, and the fact that a $9.99 ebook cannibalize your $25-35 physical book sales, the option of pricing your Kindle $20+ no longer sounds crazy.<p>Some publishers outright opt out of this race (e.g., Pragmatic Programmers).<p>I love Amazon, but they are literally gouging authors and publishers. They should have a flat 30% rate, Apple-style, and let the market decide at what price they'll buy books. Alternatively, keep the flat rate and place a cap on the price of the e-books sold through the Kindle platform (e.g., $10 for fiction, $30 for non-fiction).",1316027909

I know a photographer who makes 6 figures teaching workshops that would have been impossible to market without daily deals. He essentially created a business based on his deals. There's an old woman in SF's Chinatown who gives ""ghost tours"" of the neighborhood by selling $25 Groupons. Before the daily deal sites came along, she was a waitress...now she pulls $70-$80k a year setting her own schedule and doing something she loves. Again, impossible to market such a thing without Groupons. I recently attended a class on coffee/tea appreciation. Hugely successful for the owner, and lots of fun for attendees. He told me this was only possible because of daily deals...he had no notion of ""regular customers"" or ""full price"" customers before the deal sites came along. His business simply didn't exist.<p>#2 Businesses who successfully leverage the deals model aren't going to go blog about it or tell you exactly how to replicate their success. They're afraid that if competitors find out their little secret, they'll lose their advantage, formula, etc. The truth is there are lots more businesses who've been successful with this model than there are ""victims"". You just don't read about them because successfully leveraging daily deals is almost a trade secret of our time.",1316027510

Distribution deals could be bought and paid for, but that is a long road (see ChromeFrame).<p>Also, NPAPI is not expressive enough to enable a new programming language VM to be integrated on par with JS. Big deal, Google can write browser/OS-specific code? They tried with Gears. It's hard, and versionitis/unfrozen APIs bite hard.<p>Take these two points together and the NPAPI route is not going to get Dart widespread adoption outside of Chrome, any time soon. So would web developers use it if they had to compile to JS for too many visitors?<p>I doubt it. CoffeeScript is a transpiler and it may actually speed up code compared to writing in JS. It is popular, with slick RoR integration, but it's not taking over the world from JS.<p>Dart's new semantics (at least new number types, per the memo) will result in slower compiled-to-JS code, although the win may be programmer productivity.

5195478,comment,5194632,5195268,2,0,derefr,,,"It seems to me that a centralized blogging platform[1], that did its own analytics on the people browsing each blog, but also had enough information about each blogger's identity (perhaps through API access to their Facebooks, Twitters, G+s &c) to determine their likely audience, would be able to do very good with ad sales and placement, perhaps much better than Facebook itself (because if you're looking at Bob's wall, you aren't in a buying mood, but if you're looking at Bob's review of something on his blog, you are.)<p>The only problem with this is putting ads on what people think of as ""their"" blog. People want to be able to run <i>their own</i> ads on ""their"" blogs; even if they're hosted with some other service, they want to be the ones making money off people seeing their own content on their own pages.<p>I think Tumblr might be closest to a solution here (though even they haven't grasped it yet): once you can get people to read the blogs you host through a <i>centralized</i> interface (their ""dashboard"", effectively an RSS reader), you can display ads beside/between/around those posts that <i>you</i> think are relevant to those posts--and because the viewer never ends up going to the blogger's site itself, the blogger doesn't feel slighted by the ads + lack of revenue. They're not showing up on <i>their</i> site, after all.<p>[1] You can debate the other pros and cons of centralized/decentralized blogging--there are many--but ""makes enough money for the people doing the centralizing to offer blog-hosting as a free service, and blog consumption with a streamlined and enjoyable UX"" is definitely one of the pros of centralization.",1360472287

You seem to forget that YOU are the one asserting the validity of YOUR comparison between HFT and bitcoins. So, the onus is on YOU to prove it. So far, you have failed. Beyond that,  I simply stated that I am no bitcoin expert. But, I believe my summary of bitcoins was sufficient and relevant to draw the distinction. If it wasn't, then you should have explained how I missed the mark and why that miss is relevant to your argument.<p>2. Are you kidding? So the fact that there are people who have cancer but not yet died from it proves that cancer is good for you?

5195422,comment,5192348,5193577,1,0,larsonf,,,"Whoops, let me unpack.<p>1) That 'merit' is based on genetic variation was purely for the sake of illustration. Of course this is not the case in reality. Yet to boil down the problem to where we artificially limit the factors can help expose the real issue. In Equalistan, the fictitious illustration, everyone showed up at 25 with no history or connections. They immediately took a test. The genetic variation is just to show that random mutations can produce very varied outcomes. In the real world, the situation is inconceivable worse. You have genetic ability, mentorship, poetical power, network connections, wealth, random physical events, etc, that all affect outcomes.<p>2) Although, again, the example given was purely artificial, it is not so clear that personal 'accountability' or 'responsibility' is something that someone can help. A person with a super-charged frontal cortex will be very 'accountable' or 'responsible' with their abilities. The knock-on effects of stewardship of traits are very much the cause of other traits, whether inherited genetically or contextually (via parents or social structures). But I might be missing what you're saying here.<p>3) Resource distribution, you're right, is not zero-sum. In fact, on an absolute basis, there is no reason why anyone should ever write an article about injustice of outcomes given that overall standards of living are unbelievable high for people at large, and relative to past ages, although still very far form optimal. But this isn't the point of the article. Relative distribution of resources is the issue. But here 'resources' isn't necessarily physical things, it's anything limited. Power is zero sum, no matter what, and is still a resource to be distributed.<p>4) Yes, 'deserves' is fully-loaded, and that was the point of mentioning it. We somehow, for some bizarre reason feel that some people 'deserve' things and others do not and we should try to make sure people only have what they 'deserve'. But, you're right, this is nuts, at what point could we possible say that someone can really claim they did something independent of chance to have some moral justification to some resource, power or otherwise? Never. If you are hardworking--how can you separate that from genes plus context. If you are smart, how are you anything other than your inborn ability plus instruction. So I'm not saying some people don't deserve stuff, I'm saying this <i>whole notion</i> of deserving anything is ridiculous. Justification of outcomes as anything other than randomness is just what elitism <i>is</i>.",1360471006

With Maybe or Either, you have to check it to extract your value, but if you are doing a lot of things that will result in/use the results of Maybe/Either, you can just operate in a Monad that makes them the default.<p>Similarly, languages with multiple return values make you explicitly ignore the return value.<p>Exceptions have their benefits, but I have a personal preference for return values because they make it explicit in the interface. Also, I find that it makes more sense to handle various success and failure scenarios in the same bit of code instead of writing a best-case flow and assuming that exceptions will be thrown and errors will be dealt with somehow.<p>Exceptions are great if you can't continue due to programmer error, but most cases where people use exceptions are just expected execution paths that (in my view) make no sense to handle via non-local control flow.",1279828789

Herein lies the danger of circular reasoning or self-imposed problem.<p>Since I'm an open-minded sysadmin, I always keep an eye on the likes of puppet[1], but I have continued to reject them. Much of it has to do with philosophy: use what I can, that's tried and true. Very nearly all the right pieces for provisioning and configuration management already exist[2].<p><i>Make sure your machine is 100% described by your tool.</i><p>This, sadly, smacks of perfectionism, which is known as the enemy of Good Enough, yet I agree that these tools demand it.<p>The vast majority of this kind of description is already done by the OS via the package system and init/upstart[3]. To duplicate this kind of description with a separate tool is, to me, incomprehensible.<p>What's more, for at least the past 5 years, brand name server hardware[4] has had, in the BMC, without any special add-on cards or option keys, enough IPMI-over-LAN support that one can, over the same physical ethernet as one of the regular network interfaces, set the next boot to be PXE and trigger a reset. From that point, a fully functioning server can be up in 5-10 minutes[5].<p>With those kinds of provisioning times, why would I want to bother with something that requires the extra step of ""black art"" bootstrapping[6]? At most extreme, to make a configuration change on a running system, I'd just need to trigger the installation of a new package version on the relevant systems.<p>The best part of such a scheme is that I don't need to make any further customization choices, like puppet vs. chef. All the infrastructure I need (DHCP, DNS, TFTP, kickstart or debian-installer, local mirror/repo) is a Good Idea to have anyway, and it's all standard. I would expect any moderately experienced sysadmin to be able to debug all those pieces, without learning a DSL or a particular system's quirks. One also benefits from years of evolution of such tools, including ""free"" redundancy and pre-existing plugins for monitoring.<p>The only thing that's left is some kind of higher-level templating, which can be added as a wrapper around all of the standard things. So far, the only tool I've found that doesn't want to take over everything all at once, and works fine with incremental takeover/integration of the underlying tools) is Cobbler [7].<p>Not all problems can be solved with (custom) software.<p>[1] It was this month's BayLISA topic.<p>[2] Growing up with parents in the semiconductor industry, my exposures to Unix (and VMS, TOPS, and VM/CMS, none of which ""stuck"") and Lego were around the same time, so there's a deep-seated analogy there.<p>[3]  which are, of course, configured by files which can be contained in packages, so, really, just the package system.<p>[4] that is, any rackmount server which can be ordered with a cable management arm. That there is such a differntiating factor belies the notion of ""commodity"" hardware. I find it to be merely a euphemism for ""lowest common denominator"" hardware.<p>[5] I've observed this scale easily, with no slowdown, to 30 clients against one sub-$1k boot/repo server.<p>[6] ""Because we use cloud providers"" is a weak answer, since, besides being a self-imposed problem with other unique issues, it gets remarkably expensive beyond a few dozen (if that) instances.<p>[7] When I last dove into it a couple years ago, it was clearly focused on kickstart and the Redhat/Fedora world, with Debian/Ubuntu barely an afterthought.",1279828626

Unfortunately, not many people who are magically plucked out of their culture and society (via scholarships or employment) can bear to alienate themselves from their roots forever, so that isn't a solution, either.  Even if we consistently skim off the exceptional individuals who are capable of handling that kind of dislocation, the underclass will sustain itself.<p>Personally, I think the solution is to provide a minimum guaranteed standard of living, no questions asked, no silly ragged patchwork quilt of programs, just a minimum standard of living.  Not enough to remove the stigma of poverty -- we don't want people to be <i>comfortable</i> or <i>satisfied</i> on the dole -- just enough to make it worthwhile for people to invest in themselves and avoid anti-social behavior.<p>What we will then discover is whether an absolute level economic subsistence can transform behavior, or whether it is the stigma of relative poverty that causes people to behave antisocially.",1279828505

I couldn't have imagined what this felt like until I had to go through it, and herein lies the problem. The people who often try to erase social injustices are those who have lived a life of privilege and have absolutely no idea what it's like on the other side. A lot of them rely on second or third hand sources, but they often fail to get the gist of things. This isn't something wrong on it's own, but whenever people are frustrated they tend to grope for explanations and a lot of people fail to give this any thought whatsoever.<p>Even though this article seems to be well intentioned, but stuff like this hurts people in the longer run. Take a look at this;<p>>>>It is not simply a case of teenage girls from deprived backgrounds accidentally becoming pregnant. Evidence from many sources suggests that teen pregnancy rates are similar in poor and affluent communities. However, motherhood is a choice, as both Geronimus and Johns are keen to point out. Teenage girls from affluent backgrounds are more likely to have abortions than their less-privileged peers. In terms of reproduction, the more affluent girls are best off concentrating on their own career and development so that they can invest more in the children they have at a later stage. ""It seems that girls are assessing their life chances on a number of fronts and making conscious decisions about reproduction,"" says Johns.<<<<p>The reason why they don't have pretty often is because they can't afford abortions. Even if there are clinics that perform this for an extremely low cost. Most people lack access and awareness in the ghetto, which is just another side effect of growing up there. Affluent children can think about their life choices because they have the luxury of doing so. Most children from the ghetto don't.<p>The very idea that such behavior is driven by genetic impulses is something that shows a flawed understanding of the entire concept at some stage by the writer. I am not an expert on it, but Richard Dawkins surely is and he takes the pains to point out that genes are like a coder who writes a complex AI program. After her/his job is finished the program is on its own. If you think about it everything comes down to genetic impulses and the environment plays a crucial role in determining those impulses, but in humans another paradigm also comes into the equation; the ability for us to make a conscious choice.<p>What I am trying to say is that the expert who wrote that paper is trying to get an extremely valuable point across, but the way it is used to explain everything is demeaning and flawed. There is no magic bullet for such problems, and you really need not resort to such things. Good ole' hard work with dedication and understanding ought to do.<p>[edit: I forgot to add ""flawed understanding <i>by the writer</i>"" the expert who has been quoted is spot on, but the general conclusions derived seem to be pretty shabby.]",1279827946

My half baked theory on this is as follows:<p>Graph based thinking is a result of the rise of social networking. The term ""social network"" wasn't common until I was a senior in college. Back then most computer scientists thought of things in terms of matrices - rows and columns. After 2004 when facebook became the most popular software in the college universe, people became much more interested in graphs (social and otherwise). I believe this lead many young computer scientists to start thinking in terms of graphs - vertices and edges. If you read comp sci papers written by people over the age of 30, many of them still express things in terms of matrices.<p>In my understanding, graphs can be faster to process and in many cases easier to traverse.

Will you be checking this post in the future, (tommorow or the day after for example) so I can check back in with you when I have made the changes? Your feedback is highly useful for me, since this is the first site I have ever made.",1279825577

It certainly helps prevent smells with no lingering perfume, but that's it.<p>I tried the Crystal deodorant and was happy with it, but I had to switch back to my regular antiperspirant because sweating led to chafing, not body odor (I shower 1-2x a day). If I wasn't concerned about sweating (cold day at home, no workout), I'd probably use the Crystal stuff again.",1279825575

Conditions/restarts in common lisp seem to be a more powerful but similar alternative.<p>One problem with exceptions is that they can only be one deep. Ie. if you are executing the code invoked by handling an exception, what should happen if another exception gets thrown. Java says forget about the old exception (ie. lose information), C++ says crash. Maybe there is something in between?<p>With or without exceptions, being error-safe is still really hard. I find you have to think ""transactionally"". For every operation you perform you have to think about what you need to clean up if it fails, so you focus on specifying what you want to do, not how you want to do it.",1279825394

The court may be predisposed to believe that people and businesses have freedom to contract, and it seems reasonable to believe that the argument could be made that this clause should be left to stand as written.<p>New York may have been chosen as venue in order to ""fit"" with known case law on this and other points. Such as the allegation in paragraph 3 that Facebook is a ""domestic corporation"" in New York (a very basic detail to get wrong about this) seems like it might be an ""error-on-purpose"" to lay the foundation for using a particular case, either now or later. Sloppy errors do happen, so does venue shopping, and with a case that has this big of a potential payoff, feigned errors on the part of counsel might allow introduction of some ""hoped for"" piece of a supporting case.

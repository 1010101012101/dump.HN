2459975,comment,2459681,2459692,8,0,_delirium,,,"That's a pretty high bar that would be pretty controversial if you applied it to other fields.<p>For example, should we scorn genetics researchers who do not have a credible claim that their organisms will remain harmless after a billion generations of evolution and recombination? That's more or less what many of the anti-GMO arguments boil down to, that we ought to require genetically-modified organisms to be provably safe, both as they exist now, <i>and</i> in all possible future ways they could evolve and interact with other organisms. (And since that bar is very hard to reach, therefore, their arguments go, we should be careful about funding such research to begin with, and definitely shouldn't let any of its results out into the wild, e.g. into crops.)<p>If anything, the argument there is stronger, because evolving biological organisms that can pose a threat to humans actually exist, whereas evolving machines that can pose a threat to humans are sci-fi, and likely to remain so for a very long time. Why regulate the latter one more stringently?",1303149425

Yes, sometimes people over-share, and sometimes there is a temptation to over-share yourself.  But if you're an adult, it's easy to recognize that and make allowances for that in other people.  It's part of the human social fabric.<p>And it's quite useful to be able to post vacation photos (as one example), or blast out an update and have group comments -- it seems less isolating, and frankly less annoying, than group email updates when your friends are geographically separated.<p>Do people ""collect"" friends?  Yes... that can happen.  But like anything else, you can use it like an adult, and play to it's advantages, rather than it's disadvantages.<p>To some geeks, uninitiated social contact that doesn't make their own special needs primary is an annoyance.  But -- trust me, the resulting anger and isolation isn't really worth the curmudgeon act.  You are not that busy, you're are probably not solving world hunger, etc... lay off the snobbery.<p>Now Twitter on the other hand, is a little different.  Its nature is to be more of a public platform.  Something public personalities use -- and in that case, the character limit makes something that should be deeper, much too shallow.

By handling events in the controller instead of in the view, you remove this dependency (which is also similar to my perception of Cocoa's delegates/SproutCore's bindings, but I may be wrong).<p>Both Spine's and Backbone's view layer consists of rendering templates to the DOM. To me, a ""proper"" view layer would include things like positioning and both frameworks seem to utilize CSS to do this, for the most part.<p>I think of Backbone's controllers as a poor man's State chart, without any enter or exit callbacks (e.g going from ""#/"" to ""#/todos"" should trigger a callback that states that I will exit the state ""#/"", so I can do necessary cleanup).",1303148275

The law can handle fuzzy situations, and since it can deal with subjective things such as what was in the minds of the people doing things, it will have no trouble incorporating Bitcoin transactions into the tax structure.<p>As a first pass, it could treat them as barter transactions, which are well covered by the tax system. In fact, there is a large body of law dealing with people trading non-currency items. It is quite interesting. Suppose I buy an X and you buy a Y. Later, we swap them. If they are the same kind of thing (we are trading my Picasso for your Rembrandt) there are no tax consequences. If I later sell the Rembrandt, it is taxed as if I had bought the Rembrandt for the price I paid for the Picasso, and so my tax is based on the profit based on that. Same for you.<p>If, on the other hand, X an Y are not the same kind of thing, then it is treated as if we did a pair of sales. For example, if I trade my Picasso for your race horse, the law would treat it as if I had sold my Picasso to you and used the proceeds to buy your horse, and you sold your horse to me, using the proceeds to buy the Picasso. I have to report income equal to the difference in value between the horse and what I paid for the Picasso, and similarly for you.<p>Subsequently when I sell the race horse, it is treated as if I had bought it for in the imaginary double sale, rather than whatever I paid for my Picasso. This price that you track in order to determine what the base price is to use when determining profit or loss on a real sale is called your ""basis"" in the item. In a like kind exchange, your basis in the received item is the same as your basis in the item you gave away. In an exchange that is not like kind, you get a new basis that is what you paid for the item in the imaginary double sale transaction.<p>There's case law and regulations dealing with all kinds of variations on this theme. For instance, if I trade my male horse for your female horse, is that a like kind exchange or not?<p>I don't think the law will have any trouble at all dealing with taxation and Bitcoin.",1303148091

Early on, he tells the story of being scolded in school for noticing that his teacher's explanation for how planes work cannot be right, because if you turned the plane upside down, the Bernoulli force would be toward the ground.<p>He then goes on to talk about the Coanda effect, and how that combined with the shape of the wing makes the wing direct air toward the ground, and thus provides lift.<p>Suppose back in sixth grade, his teacher had taught that explanation instead of the incorrect Bernoulli effect explanation. He'd still have the same problem! Turn a wing upside down and the Coanda effect and shape are now deflecting air toward the sky, and the lift is toward the ground.<p>He should have had a little section at the end covering how planes actually fly upside down.<p>There are at least four ways to force air downward in order to help provide lift. There's the Bernoulli effect, which he points out doesn't provide very much lift. There's the Coanda effect, which he covers. Then there's simple brute force--point whatever you are using to provide thrust so that the thrust vector aims up somewhat instead of level. Finally, put something in the air flow at an angle so that it directly deflects the airflow down.<p>The first two work in the wrong direction when upside down, so it is the later two that are responsible for upside down flight. Note that both of these come with significant cost. If you are pointing your thrust vector up, you lose some forward thrust, so it is going to take longer and cost more in fuel to get where you are going. If you stick some flat surface in the air flow to just directly direct air downward, you are also introducing considerable drag, again making your trip take longer and use a lot more fuel.",1303146663

An isomorphism of rings is not the same as an isomorphism of groups, for example.<p>In category theory, an isomorphism is a morphism that has an inverse. Category theorists sometimes use the punning device of treating “iso” as an adjective, so that an “isomorphism” is an “iso morphism”.<p>But before you can talk about morphisms, you need to know which category you‘re talking about. An isomorphism in the category of sets is indeed precisely the same thing as a bijection, so in that sense bijections <i>are</i> necessarily isomorphisms. But the word is traditionally used in the context of categories of algebras (e.g. groups, rings, fields, etc.): the morphisms of those categories are the homomorphisms (i.e. functions that preserve the algebraic structure), and so of course the iso morphisms in those categories are also homomorphisms.",1303146296

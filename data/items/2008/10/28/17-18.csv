346562,comment,346329,346329,0,0,geebee,,,"Another reason this one might be different: tech led the ""recession"" of 2001-2003, whereas housing and banking are leading this current recession.<p>I don't think that the general economy did technically go into recession in 2001 (partly because a housing-bubble fueled consumer binge delayed the reckoning and probably made it much worse).  But high tech went through a brutal correction.  For a couple of years, it was crickets chirping out there.<p>So I think that tech took its lumps the way the general economy probably should have.  And it worked.  We got rid of a lot of crappy products, companies, and (sorry to be so blunt) a lot of crappy people who really had no business in high tech.  While those crickets were chirping, a lot of very motivated entrepreneurs put down the groundwork for the next wave of excellent high tech companies.<p>I will agree that things got a bit bubblicious toward the end of 2007 in high tech... but in the end, I just don't think high tech has the same kind of delayed reckoning that banking and real estate are facing.  Perhaps 2001-2003 should have been a nuclear winter for those industries as well - then they would have gone through the same soul searching, reckoning, culling, and rebuilding that tech had to do.<p>Yeah, tech will take a hit - there's no way it'll completely avoid the credit crisis.   But this time, we're on the peripheries, and we've already taken a lot of our lumps..",1225216594

Instead of File->New and choosing a size, have some pre-built page sizes that work with a partner printer.<p>In fact, with some of those tweaks, you could probably license it to some album companies–they already license software like photojunction for this purpose. No reason it couldn't be online and automatically order/push your files.<p>If you had an online archiving service, similar to Photoshelter, this would be a great add-on. You wouldn't have to pull your image(s) down to convert to B/W or prep for a certain print size. I think there's definitely room for a small agile company (leverage cloud services) in this space (with Digital Railroad going out of business).<p>Also, since this is Flash-based, why not convert this to an AIR app ... then you have access to the local filesystem but still have great networking features that let you push files to labs/S3/stock sites.

I could see some sort of school related reprimand...but really...fifteen years old and he shows them up and their best response is lets press federal charges.<p>Now, assuming that it is true that he has had disobediance problems previously, attempted to break security previously, and was not acting in the form of a white-hat, something should definitely be done.  However, that's like saying you're pressing charges against someone for logging into your computer when your password is on a sticky note at the edge of your screen.  Not just schools but everyone has to do their own part in order to protect information and the school didn't do their part.  I don't have the facts but it would appear that the student did no extraneous work in accessing the information.<p>I have to say that I, in a way, relate to this situation.  When I went to High School I was pretty much watched like a hawk due to my well known understanding and skill on the computer.  I was attempted to be blamed numerous times for when something would happen, mostly by a specific administrator who had a grudge against me.  Luckily, nothing to this extreme ever happened and its not like I did anything wrong anyways.  I ended up working for the school as an Assistant IT Coord my last couple of years.<p>I'd also like to bring comment to a point made by another comment on here.  As far as poor technology policies and idiotic administration, that's one of the things my venture is trying to work on.  Understanding that most of the reason these very restrictive policies are there is because of a lack of understanding compounded with a lack of control for what they don't understand.  The other major source is fear of reprocussions and dangers.  My venture is focused in the area of Educational Technology and part of what we're doing, especially in southern Illinois at the moment, is trying to create tools/programs/systems and structure policies with schools that alleviate the problems both on the administrative side and the student side.  Policy work and simplistic administrator friendly systems are something that are a necessity to persuade uptight school districts into not only accepting technology but being more open with students use of it.<p>...I may have ended up a little off-topic. :P",1225214789

Oh, you have to test both.<p>Also, an interface is a great way of implementing ""worry about that shit later - just let me talk to it now"". You can define and evolve the contracts before you have to refactor expensive implementations.<p>As for AbstractSomethingFactory, I've not written a bit of code like that for night on 10 years.

Kids are basically psychopaths in such a young age - they just act according to whatever they feel, and if they haven't been taught boundaries - well, shit. \nBad environments promote shitty attitudes and behaviour patterns, which is often due to their parents. Rich or poor doesn't matter. Some of the worst bullies I've been faced against came from wealthy families.<p>I think schools should be more focused on teaching the bullies way to cope with things at home, instead of simply excluding them. The bullies don't change their attitude, and someone new will take their place (I recall a Danish study about class rooms where the bullies removed, experienced the same amount of bulling just a month later. New bullies take other's places).",1361890541

Indeed, many in this thread have no issue with that because they like the technology.<p>The issues he raises with Glass are reasonable points for <i>non-engineers</i>.  (Engineers put up with more than average people do.)  The most pressing concern for most consumers will be, simply: ""Do I feel stupid using this in public?""  I feel stupid using Siri in public.  If that were the main product it would have flopped.  I feel stupid using my Bluetooth headset in public, and wouldn't own one if it weren't illegal to talk and drive without one.  That's not to say that it doesn't have value, just that social pressure is a powerful force.<p>I do think the media will turn on Glass once it's released.

Also as they explained, As long as you are building something that people love, then a corporation status doesnt change how likely you are to succeed (<a href=""http://blog.microryza.com/why-is-microryza-for-profit/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.microryza.com/why-is-microryza-for-profit/</a>). So, why not stop thinking about making money but funding good science?<p>In conclusion, I am afraid using microfinance to feed non-filtered research proposals may not necessarily make Kickstarter for research.",1361890267

Now, I'm going to assume that it is not intentionally racist, but it has the same ultimate effect.<p>Let me explain.<p>There are many different types of prejudice. There is prejudicial hatred, that tends to be obvious and blatant but is also people's stereotypical example of the sort of prejudice that we should all fight against. There's also something that people call ""the soft bigotry of low expectations"", and this is also pretty bad. It manifests itself in forms such as ""well, that's pretty good... for a girl"" or ""for an Indian"" or what-have-you. This is a pernicious sort of prejudice because it affects how people are treated, what sorts of opportunities people have, etc. But for the perpetrators of it can feel more justified and less morally wrong than more blatant racism.<p>But there's a semi-related form of prejudice which I'll call paternalism. It's where you remove agency and culpability from certain folks and rest responsibility in the hands of ""more developed"" people. This is even more pernicious than low expectations because it sort of feels like you're doing the victims a favor. By taking away moral responsibility and devolving it on oneself it may seem like you are accepting a burden for someone else. But in reality you are denying them agency, denying them responsibility, and diminishing them as people. All human beings are responsible for their own actions, and to treat them like children or animals by denying them the responsibility for their deeds is incredibly dehumanizing.<p>So to answer your question, no, the makers of the Samsung Galaxy do not have a moral obligation for creating a device which can serve as a compass, even though a compass can be used to point a weapon. That responsibility lies with, and should never be removed from, the individual who uses the device.",1361890173

This does not place the ultimate blame on Cisco.<p>You say ""what [West Virginia] wanted"", but the article shows how Cisco was unable to show that they knew what WV wanted. For example, Cisco claims that WV specified internal dual power supplies but there is no record that WV ever had that requirement. Instead, ""what WV wanted"" is defined only as being whatever WV signed off on at the end.<p>As to if Cisco's behavior is expected or not, the Ars article says: ""[Cisco] had a moral responsibility to propose a plan which reasonably complied with Cisco's own engineering standards"" but that instead ""Cisco representatives showed a wanton indifference to the interests of the public in recommending using $24 million of public funds to purchase 1,164 Cisco model 3945 branch routers.""<p>Ars even links to section 5A-3-33d of the West Virginia Code. The likely relevant clause is ""(B) Performance in violation of standards established by law or generally accepted standards of the trade or profession amounting to intentionally deficient or grossly negligent performance on one or more public contracts;"", and the auditor's report shows examples of how Cisco's actions were likely in violation of their own published standards.<p>This is not a crime.

Such a workout plan focuses more on muscles getting larger rather than stronger.<p>Also, if you're looking to cut down on bodyfat in order to see your abs, I would actually use bcaas instead of the whey simply because the goat milk whey likely has calories that your body will use for fuel (ignore that sentence if it doesn't have calories), whereas bcaa's take a different metabolic pathway and go right to your muscles. The point of exercising on an empty stomach is that you're working out with a depleted glycogen supply, which your body will always use up before touching fat storage. If you take in calories before working out then your body will burn through those first before reaching into the fat storage.<p>After you've finished working out - hopefully your workout was done quickly so you should be very sweaty and have burned a ton of fat calories - wait for a couple hours (at least 2-3) before eating anything. During this time I generally drink almost a gallon of water containing a bunch of bcaas. Your body will continue to burn a shit-ton more fat and will still be primed for building muscle once you spike it with carbs and protein. Be careful to avoid fat though!<p>Good luck on attaining your fitness goals ;)",1361888495

That's just to make you feel better, not them.</i><p>I agree. Part of the problem is that adults tend to hold kids to a much different standard than they hold themselves. For instance, as an adult, if I'm working in a company where verbal bullying and harassment is a problem, and HR does nothing to address the situation, then I'll just give my two-week notice and move on to another company. Kids on the other hand don't have the option of giving their two-week notice and moving on to another school because of a 'hostile work environment'.<p>How many adults do you think would stick around at a company if they had to put up with the level of violence and harassment we subject our kids to in schools? And if the only response they got back from management and HR was a ""sticks and stones"" speech? Forget about it! Which highlights another difference- it's also in a company's own self interest to address these issues seriously, because if they don't, it's gonna effect their bottom line when good employees start leaving. But, what motivation do schools really have- it's not as if their ""employees"" (students) get to quit if they don't like the way they are being treated.<p><i>What does this teach kids? That there is no justice in the world except that which you take by violence?</i><p>My son is only two and a half right now. When he gets older my advice to him will be to first go through all of the proper channels in case bullying comes up. Give the system a chance to work, and get some documentation that you did so. And if it does work great. And if it doesn't, a right-cross to the bully's nose is what worked for me when I was a kid. Will this stop the bully from picking on people?

In C# (or at least the most common implementation), there is a per object overhead of at least 8 bytes on 32-bit platforms and 16 bytes on 64-bit platforms. C++ implementations typically have no overhead for objects without virtual functions and 4 or 8 bytes of overhead for objects with virtual functions. This means that a program written in C++ could potentially use a much lower amount of memory than one written in C#.",1361887221

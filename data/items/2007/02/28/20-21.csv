Although, there are some workarounds you can code to make the interaction with them feel smoother. Ya, for developers, maintaining Flex apps is really easy because everything visual is a mxml component and can be abstracted from the rest of the code. It's easier to maintain and debug, at least compared to plain actionscript or javascript.",1172695284

That's an average of less than one page per second.  61000/24/60/60=.706<p>I've built embedded devices that served Perl CGI pages from an all-Perl web server far faster than that (while also doing the work it was designed to do...the Perl CGI was just the administrative UI).<p>I'm really quite hopeful that this isn't a good example of Rails scalability (because I've been playing with Rails of late with the intent to write my next project in it).  I don't mind losing some performance and efficiency to improve coder efficiency, but there is a page load time at which your customers will get bored and leave...I don't want to find out what the load time is.",1172695122

1582,comment,1452,1478,0,0,gms,,,"Well actually Python does have an eval() that can be called on expressions in the form of strings. The problem is that any potential macro anything would be nowhere near as seamless as it in Lisp, since the parse tree isn't right there for everything. But with enough effort (and closing your eyes to avoid how horrible it would look), you could maybe make something.",1172694111

The majority of people in the dissatisfied pool are people who are barely making enough money to stay afloat and not enough money (and often not the right skills) to work their way out of the situation.",1172693399
1578,comment,1548,1548,0,0,papersmith,,,"One complaint I have with Flex apps is that even with a minor increase in GUI complexity, it begins to lag like crazy.  This is especially true with tables; scrolling through them is a pain.  Btw, I experience this on a p4 3ghz 1gb ram running Flash 9 in both Linux and Windows.  In comparison, most of the Ajax apps I use feel fairly smooth, but I guess from a developer's point of view, it's a compromise in maintainability.",1172693241

It could make sense mathematically, but it doesn't model things correctly.<p>Take Virginia, for example:<p>""Ranked No. 1 in the ""Fastest-Growing Firms"" indicator"" and ""Ranked No. 2 in the ""High-Tech Jobs"" indicator,""<p>and then<p>""Ranked No. 47 in the ""Entrepreneurial Activity"" indicator""<p>We have a lot of fast-growing firms, a lot of high tech jobs, but very few people are running startups here.<p>But if you think about it, what is it that makes a startup hub? A university campus? A high tech sector? PG says a lot about this, I think the conclusion is that they exist where you make them exist.",1172693074

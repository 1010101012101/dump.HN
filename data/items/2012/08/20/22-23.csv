We know that some people will prefer to pay, but others (like me) would rather take a few seconds to complete a survey than pay.  Our hope is that the surveywalls will let users access content that otherwise would have been beyond their reach.  And at the same time, quality content publishers will be able to make money off their work.<p>As to the researcher side, we agree with you that nothing beats revealed user behavior when optimizing web sites or apps.  But it's not cheap or even possible to A/B test in other situations.<p>Suppose that you're a restaurant owner and want a new sign for your building.  It's not practical to purchase two signs and see how alternating the signs affects business on different days.  And it's also not in budget to spend $10k or more on a traditional market research survey.<p>Or if you're a politician, you can not wait until voting day to see which of your various ad campaigns worked in different districts.  You need proxy measurements.<p>Companies already ask these types of questions using traditional approaches like panels and phone polling.  We provide a cheaper way for them to do it online.  All approaches have built in biases, and we're working to account for the biases and quality issues in online polls.  As you point out, we'll have to do that to succeed.",1345502873

I would much prefer the dev team here to do a great job, ""fixing"" the broken online survey business instead of adding on to it. If you are part of the dev team, I apologize for the confusion.<p>Not sure how the ""doll"" analogy applies here. When a doll sells, even to a small proportion of population, it sells. When you do an online survey, you gain very little true insight. You definitely will gain more insight from the two alternatives I mentioned (analytics on logs, properly designed experiment).<p>Don't get me wrong, I am not saying the whole online survey industry is wrong. Amazon Turk is wonderful, so is SocialSci. My company actually use result from Turkers for building models. The premise for that to work is a well designed experiment with qualified turkers. A survey that replacing ""paywall"" basically means you do not have a clear targeted recruitment poll. You get basically anyone who pays your website a visit.

Considering that Linux was the original motivation for ""The Cathedral and the Bazaar"", identified as ""the Bazaar"", I highly suspect that you are not using the terms in the same way the original essay intended.<p>Indeed, throughout this discussion it has become clear that you regard anything with a sense of design and some amount of quality control as a ""Cathedral"". If you want to discuss the benefits of design and quality control, that's a perfectly fine discussion to have, but it also seems to be completely orthogonal to the original discussion of cathedrals and bazaars, which was wholly focused on the development process.<p>In fact, I wonder if your arguments would be better focused on the concept of ""craftsmanship"" (or lack thereof) in programming...keeping in mind, of course, that both cathedral builders and bazaar artisans have historically had a notion of craftsmanship.",1345502830

It's better than you miss out on a top performer than it is to hire someone into a senior position who turns out to be a bozo.   That may be the cause of the OP's perceived ""oddness"".<p>The fact that Google's promotion system is done exclusively by peers (i.e., the people who decide whether someone at level N should progress to level N+1 are composed of engineers at levels N+1 and N+2; the manager can give input to the promotion committee, but it's not the manager's call) is a good way to hopefully prevent bozos from getting promoted from within.<p>Is it perfect?

But first, that requires knowing about history, which far too many people don't. The whole issue of whether cathedrals or bazaars produce better software is orthogonal, and needs to be addressed to different situations.<p>First, are there still places where cathedral style development is a very good idea, hinging on being necessary? Yes, but it has to be done right, and unfortunately, cathedrals aren't (usually) very flexible. The Mars rovers were all cathedral programmed and work pretty darn well; on the other end of the spectrum you can find all sorts of big projects that went awry, even with ""coherent design"".<p>Second, is cathedral design necessary for all software today? No. I'm fortunate enough to have the perspective of a second generation programmer; my father started in middle school by sending punch cards to the university and would get his results a week later. Careful planning was not just a good idea then; it was absolutely necessary. These days he has a computer with more power and connectivity in his pocket than was available when he was born. His turnaround time for seeing results on software changes these days is well under five minutes.<p>So the computing industry has come so far so fast that it's not just unnecessary to make grandiose plans in advance, it may actually be a bad idea in a number of cases (what was it Paul Graham said? ""If you want a recipe for a startup that's going to die, here it is: a couple of founders who have some great idea they know everyone is going to love, and that's what they're going to build, no matter what."").<p>It's kind of nice that anyone can just pick up a computer and start writing software these days. Sure, sometimes it's scary too, to think of all the inefficiencies, and wrong results and security holes that plague software. But it's so nice and liberating to think: ""you know what? I can do it better, I have the freedom to try to make something better."" And you can develop all cathedral style if you want!<p>Could software be improved? Definitely! Should people learn from history? Yes, including the mistakes. Would more design and coherent vision help make better software? Maybe; go ahead and prove it (a quick note: unfortunately, the market doesn't select the best software or designs, so you will have to prove it some other way, but being successful market wise is a good start).",1345501441

The outer layer which goes around the whole base would have the usual barbed wire top and those big poles to prevent people just ramming their car right through the fence.  This layer usually has a dirt road on the inside where the security forces routinely cruise the perimeter looking for evidence of tampering etc.  If there are electronic detection mechanisms in use, it isn't apparent.  The gates through this layer is guarded by men/women with automatic weapons, trucks, road spikes and a secondary wall they can raise up 100m in base in case someone just tries driving past the guard.  Then any sensitive buildings within the base are usually guarded by a second layer of barbed wire fences.  The perimeter of this layer is usually well within sight of more armed guards with trucks.  Then getting into buildings within this compound involves more cameras, badges, codes, but probably most importantly: the regular people who work there take security pretty seriously and have no problem confronting people that look or act suspicious or don't have a badge, etc.  It may not be as technologically advanced as this system described in the article but its probably far cheaper and far more effective.",1345500917

Well, suppose a new company came along that succeeded massively by means of good software design.  A lot of things would turn on their head.

People all over the world told me it was the only newsletter from a company they read because they learned something new every week. They even forwarded it to other people in their company.<p>In the end, we launched, and I spun out the newsletter into it's own thing.

I don't know if you were using this as a general example of how you managed to solve a problem...but this really isn't a ""web programming"" problem, in that it's a program that has many uses outside of a web server. In fact, it should be a standalone script that has no awareness of the web (unless it's doing something with a lot of moving parts, like recording results and doing machine learning).<p>In any case, the problem with people trying to learn web programming is that it encompasses many things...I'd argue that web programming doesn't really require learning HTML beyond the basic idea of HTML (and CSS)...and yet many beginner programmers spend a month or so thinking that programming consists of memorizing tags and CSS rules (nevermind cross-browser considerations)...which must be frustrating as hell.",1345500414

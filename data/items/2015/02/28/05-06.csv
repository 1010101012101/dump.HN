Fearing a phishing attempt I went direct to their website and logged in. A big red banner said to contact them ASAP. I called a number they gave. They asked if I ordered plane tickets for Turkey. I said no. They said ok, no worries, they auto-blocked the purchase. We went through my history to make sure everything else was correct, it was. The card was cancelled and they mailed a new one overnight. It was under 22 hours from e-mail to new card in hand. I was very impressed.<p>My sister has info stolen from a fake pad at a gas station. It was a debit card. She got all of her money back but it took close to 6 weeks to fully resolve. If you live paycheck to paycheck, and at the time she wasn&#x27;t too far off, that can be a very difficult situation. It worked out in the end but it was definitely painful for her.<p>By and large these are not &quot;ruined life&quot; events. Identity theft and fraud are, unfortunately, common and mainstream enough that hitting &quot;ruined life&quot; level is exceptionally difficult. Back in the 90s when the average person didn&#x27;t know those terms it might have been more common.

They made the determination that the cost of implementing proper security would be more than the cost of cleaning up the breach.<p>However, this is just offloading the negative externalities onto the banks and the customers. That&#x27;s just shitty. I&#x27;m not one to call for government regulation that easily, but this is exactly why we have a federal government. To make sure the citizens are being protected. That&#x27;s why the FCC declared ISPs to be utilities. To stop them from abusing the customers. That&#x27;s why the EPA has regulations on chemical and oil spills. If Home Depot got fined $100m for their breach, what would the cost look like then?<p>The cost of security is more than the impact of the lost business.

Even the programs that actually work to remove these kinds of threats (including AdAware and SD Search and Destroy) can blur the distinction between actions that are necessary to repair the problem and things that are a different kind of nuisance but not directly a threat to the operation of the computer (like tracking cookies). Software that makes installing it to use it optional is preferred, as the ongoing monitoring can often tax the computer as badly as the software being removed. (Note I&#x27;m talking only about anti-adware software here, not general anti-virus software.)<p>I would love to give a better option than re-install your operating system all of your software, and even that is often a difficult option since the re-installation mediums aren&#x27;t even shipped with the computer in many cases.

SSNs, full name, date of birth, employer and yearly income, home address. Everything you need to ruin someone&#x27;s life for real, and permanently.

Having to constantly watch your credit because everything an attacker needs to open a new credit card in your name is ruin.<p>Beyond that though, little inconveniences add up. How many times do you want to have to replace your credit card in a year?

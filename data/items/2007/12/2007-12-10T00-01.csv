Let's say it's $42,000 after tax. That gives our pal $3,500 a month. $1600 gets him a very nice studio apartment without roommates and covers utilities (no fiber internet available, unfortunately). He has $1900 a month to buy food, clothing, and entertainment...   this would be enough to eat three solid meals a day in mid priced restaurants. Food isn't particularly expensive in San Francisco either, it's not like New York. Doesn't sound like a bad standard of living to me in the slightest, unless I'm missing something.",1197247497

If you're really worried, you can always find room mates on craigslist. <p>If this is the industry you want to be in, you're best bet is to make the move out here.  The job is reasonable, and even if it doesn't work out there are a hell of a lot more opportunities.",1197246682

Sure, 60k might be a little low for the SF area, but who really cares that much? It takes care of the basics, and thats all you'll really need (I assume you're not looking to start a family any time soon). You'll be living in an awesome city (where a lot of people in the field dream of living), getting a load of new experience, and working with people who will probably teach you more than you could learn on your own in the same amount of time.",1197246427

Half-life features a hero called Gordon Freeman who wears an orange armor body suit thing. She is trying to escape the lab, and Freeman was trying to escape the lab as well.<p><i>""The unobtrusive presentation of the female protagonist doesn't force a male gender perspective on the player as is the norm in FPS games.""</i><p>What is the writer talking about?? In most other FPS games you can't tell if the character is a male or not either. All you can see is a gun and hands. How is that forcing the male gender perspective on the player?<p><i>""she comes to represent man's attempt to construct an idealized mother figure through the cold logic of science""</i><p>Ok, I'm done reading that clap-trap. Science always gets the shit end of the stick when lay-people discuss it. It's either evil and responsible for very bad things, or it's cold and it ignores people, or it's unnatural.",1197245657
87537,comment,87522,87522,0,0,iamelgringo,,,"Personally, what you're getting offered seems rather low, but I'm not sure.  I know that living on 60k is going to be difficult in San Francisco, but you're young, and may not object to ramen noodles.  Look on Craigslist.com to find out what rents are for a room in San Fran before you move out.  I know that 60k might seem like a lot when you're 20, but it's really not that much out here in the Bay area.<p>If you really like the group of programmers, and you really want to move to the Bay, that's worth something, take that into consideration.  And, there's always the ""chase your dream"" scenario that's worth something as well.  <p>As to the stock options:  If those are the ratio's,  you're not going to be getting much if the company gets acquired.  Think about it this way.  If there are 3000 shares outstanding, and you get 4 shares, you own %0.13 of the company ( 4/3000).  Now, whatever the company gets acquired for, you receive % 0.13 of that amount.  So, if the company gets acquired for $10 million, you get $13,000.   $100 million, and you get $130,000.  <p>As an aside, there are precious few companies getting acquired for $100 million.  There aren't that many acquiring companies that can afford it.<p>Another issue:  There is a lot of competition in the Bay area as opposed to other parts of the country.  There are a lot of incredibly smart people out here with several degrees and tons of experience.  San Fran has some of the highest per capita Phd's in the nation.  It can be a bit intimidating when your first arrive.  You go from being one of the elite geeks in your small pond, to being just another techie in a huge ocean of nerds.  <p>I've known a couple of people who came out here, and felt blown away by their own lack of education.  It's easy to feel pretty inadequate.  Paul Graham can write about the problems with the educational system, but Paul also has his PhD in Computer Science from Harvard.  So, take that into consideration, too.  He also recommends people finish their college degrees before starting their startups.<p>I've always been one to chase my dreams, however despite what anyone else said.  If you really want it, you'll find a way to make it work.",1197245636

I look forward to using it. <p>As for the questions about the lack of ""scalability"" improvements, I don't really care. Its not needed for what I use it for anyway (and probably the same for most people).",1197245487
87535,comment,87522,87522,0,0,rms,,,"In your position, I would take the offer. You get to move from  Missouri to one of the world's best cities. SF is one of two cities in America with 24/7 public transportation. Weed is legal, which reflects the extremely socially liberal feel of the city. SF has an actual music scene.<p>
 .16% of the company is low. You can try and get more, of course, but the offer as it stands is a great way for you to relocate to SF. If you don't fall in love with this company, you can always find a better job with a different company.<p>
$60,000 is low for an uber-hacker in SF but it's plenty to live, especially when you're relatively young. Get a roommate if you want to live in a decent place in a safe part of town, otherwise, the less safe or more boring parts of town are cheaper. I'm trying to find a place on Craigslist now for an upcoming move to SF...    right now I'm looking in the Castro, Mission, and Noe Valley areas.  However, few places are available in advance on Craigslist. I think the way it actually works is the place is listed on Craigslist, you go to the open house the next day and beg the landlord to take your deposit, and maybe you can get the place. Things are not nearly as tight outside of SF proper, but there is a reason SF housing is in such high demand.<p>This is a good overview of SF neighborhoods. <a href=""http://www.dreamworld.org/sfguide/Neighborhoods/index.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.dreamworld.org/sfguide/Neighborhoods/index.html</a>",1197245437

BUT, you'll be in the game, you'll learn a lot, and you'll meet smart people.<p>From this first experience you will enter into your second startup employment round better educated and in a better position to negotiate.<p>As long as you can live off the salary for a year or two, and they're covering your relocation, I'd say go for it and enjoy the ride.  You can almost always move back to MO and be richer for the experience, if nothing else.",1197245420

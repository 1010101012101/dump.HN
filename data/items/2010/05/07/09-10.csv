I got it working in the end, after several emails, but it left a bitter taste in my mouth. When the controversies around iPhone app store approvals and developer accounts started, I swore to my self I would get rid of all Apple products, and I did.<p>Frankly, a company that displays such arrogance doesn't get to get me as a customer. Their software is limited, hardware overpriced, policies ridiculous, and in my opinion, only thing they got going for them is the design.<p>Computers are devices, not fragrances, they should be feature-full and powerful, not beautiful in a chick magazine sort of way.",1273226357

Society has progressed so much, and wealth has been generated at such a fast clip, that cutting off your nose would do nothing but spiting your face.<p>The reality is that when you look at what has been powering Greece's astounding growth from 1996 - 2006, it was mainly tourism + foreign direct investment.<p>If you do an Argentina-type default, tourism will instantly be hit and FDI will go to nearly zero (or very close) VERY quickly. The unfortunate truth is that pulling out of the Eurozone wouldn't be a cure all. Without the discipline being forced on the politicians by the EU + IMF, what will force them to change and be fiscally prudent? Nothing will. If anything, things would only get worse because they would be able to print their own money again.<p>You know what happens when a profligate government can print their own money? Ask Zimbabwe.",1273225596

Nobody in my social group ever uses Facebook invites, so the main thing is the status updates and replies. Facebook has somewhat of an advantage over Twitter on that still due to: 1. more generous length limits; and 2. a series of replies to a status going into a thread instead of the main flat status-update namespace; and 3.

After one takes some time to learn git's data structures, it's trivial to understand exactly what effect each command has on your repository.  No need to mentally model your source control system in leaky abstractions, the reality itself is simple enough to handle directly.<p>> The first thing that struck me about git is the apparent use of SHA1 hashing as a basic foundation for the whole system. Maybe that's not even true and no doubt there is much more to it.<p>Yep, it is true, and that really is all there is to it.

But I can point at any behavior to indicate anything, if my concepts do not have any real relationship to explaining how the behavior is produced or its evolutionary function.

However, I agree with you; my comment was terse, snarky, and didn't allow for any real debate.<p>However, I my stance doesn't change one bit.  Six months is not enough time to learn enough to be a good software developer, period.  I am a self taught software engineer, but it took a long time before I was capable of writing production quality code (certainly more than 6 months) and I am of course still learning.<p>We don't need more people like this in the field.  I interview enough of them and I can't stand it.  Great, so you can write a basic website propped up by a massive framework.<p>Do you know how to troubleshoot performance problems?  Can you diagnose non-trivial issues, perhaps relating to the underlying hardware?  Is your code maintainable?  Does it account for edge cases properly?  Is it robust enough to withstand serious use?<p>Probably not.  I am 100% behind anyone who wants to learn how to program.  I am not behind hiring them at the size month mark.  I used RoR in a pejorative manner because it is kiddie stuff.  Anyone can teach themselves to use it pretty quickly, but that doesn't make you a good engineer (""programmer"", whatever.)<p>Our industry is <i>full</i> of incompetent people, we don't need more of them. I work in a systems group and I don't see this problem in mechanical or electrical engineering.  Sure, there will always exist people who are in the lower ranks of their respective field, but in software we are inundated by people who simply have no clue what they are doing beyond the most basic of tasks.<p>This is a problem, so when I see ""How to get a developer job in six months"" it makes me cringe.

It's reasonable to simultaneously treat employee equity as $2mm valuation and investor equity at $5mm valuation, especially with a note.<p>In this case, though, I think the way to win the negotiation is to walk.  A competent engineer is more like $150-200k total comp in the bay area, and doing that as $100k + 100k of equity/yr in a real company is pretty plausible.<p>A more plausible story is offering $50-100k and then equity levels which ramp up rapidly as you go down to $50k.  Someone taking $50k vs. $60k should get <i>more</i> than $10k x 4 of extra equity.  Maybe something like 100/0.10 90/0.15 80/0.25 70/0.40 60/0.6 50/1.

Now perhaps SO is not intended to be for that sort of question, and that is of course for SO to decide.<p>I suppose the reason many people come to SO to <i>read</i> questions is that they'd like to learn about a subject area, and the reason many people come is <i>write</i> answers is that they'd like to teach a little about a subject, and this sort of open-ended questions offer the opportunity for someone to answer questions the asker didn't even know they had - like should I add an index to my db, if so when? Should I use natural keys? etc. To in effect tell them to unask all those questions they would otherwise have asked in groping their way to familiarity with the subject. It functions as an FAQ for that particular subject, to prevent beginners from making the same mistakes/asking the same questions over and over.<p>So that sort of question can be very useful for someone starting out, for the kind of person your site targets. Maybe that sort of question belongs on some other site though, a sort of training site rather than a question/answer site, or maybe SO should just expand to encompass that sort of FAQ function?<p>I'm not so convinced that for this category of question there is a clear line between 'db x breaks when I do y, what should I do?', 'Do I need to use db transactions in db x?', and 'What are the common db mistakes?', and that one sort of question/answer is rational, and another narrative - is the division really that clear? Are there not many many borderline questions which solicit opinion (of someone who knows more about the subject), and yet are useful for others too? Are not many of these smaller 'science-in-the-small' questions actually answerable in many different ways, each of which may be somewhat valid and none of which is actually 'right' in some categorical way?<p>For example this question, which is equally open-ended, remains open (rightly so I think as it could be a useful discussion :)<p><a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/327199/what-will-we-do-after-access?lq=1"" rel=""nofollow"">http://stackoverflow.com/questions/327199/what-will-we-do-af...</a>",1345573937

Lets say you put $2K into an IRA (no 401k) so $68K after that. Estimated federal tax is $10,592 [1], Another 6.2% goes to Social security so $4,340 [2], estimated state income tax (CA) is about $3,922 so rolling that up, $68K - $18,854 in taxes thats not quite $50K left over ($49,146) so that is about $4095 a month.<p>So if you're living on $4095 a month you're looking at spending $2K on a studio apartment [4] minus the rental subsidy of $1k making it $1k on the Apartment. Call it $500/month on food, $250 / month on subscription services (cable / phone / internet) and maybe $75 /month on rental insurance so maybe half your monthly on recurring costs. Leaving you $2K/month for dynamic costs. If you don't own a car (and I wouldn't recommend it) then you're basically able to move what is left around for things like the occasional furniture or clothing purchase. Going out to eat occasionally and saving for a rainy day. It should be possible to put away $500/month of that into savings on typical month.<p>The bottom line is I don't see $70K/month as 'pretty tough' :-) but I can certainly see it not giving you a luxurious lifestyle.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.calcxml.com/calculators/federal-income-tax-estimator"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.calcxml.com/calculators/federal-income-tax-estima...</a><p>[2] <a href=""https://www.socialsecurity.gov/OACT/COLA/cbb.html#Series"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.socialsecurity.gov/OACT/COLA/cbb.html#Series</a><p>[3] <a href=""https://www.ftb.ca.gov/forms/2012_California_Tax_Rates_and_Exemptions.shtml"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.ftb.ca.gov/forms/2012_California_Tax_Rates_and_E...</a><p>[4] <a href=""http://www.mynewplace.com/city/san-francisco-apartments-for-rent-california"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.mynewplace.com/city/san-francisco-apartments-for-...</a>",1345573747

The mechanic of running your offer through a model to justify a counteroffer is a great one that more nerds should adopt, but she's missing an input: what does she <i>want</i> the model to say?

    60k with 1% equity or
    50k with 1.5% equity or

This offer says that 1% of the company is worth $20k. The company is worth $2MM. <i>Late note: this analysis is silly, see comments below.</i><p>Later:<p><pre><code>    Inputs:

    (I used my offer, plus benefits like rent subsidy)
    -        Companys valuation 
    (I used $5M, the cap for Keens seed note)

No, it's $2MM, the CEO just told you so, right?<p>Frankly, an offer with a .5%->2% spread between possible equity stakes is a red flag. Those are <i>wildly</i> different equity grants for the exact same role.<p>Also:<p><i>Our expected net worth after a few years in our existing management positions was, by any practical estimation, the most financially sound outcome  and a very good one, at that.

For example teefury.com is a site that does a sort of similar thing to you with time based sales, they sell at around $10 each but would never do well at $25 each.<p>My (anecdotal -- myself and friends) understanding of why people aren't comfortable spending $25 on a time-sale t-shirt is that you're selling selling based on 2 things, the t-shirt itself and the idea that it's time-exclusive, this adds pressure. If I purchase a t-shirt from somewhere like Threadless I know it's likely if I wait 2 weeks it's going to be there still, so I don't feel like ""I must buy now!"" and then I don't feel like I'm paying for something I might not want in a week, whereas if I see a t-shirt on your site with 1 day to go: ""That t-shirt is cool! Hmm, but I have to buy it right now... and $25 is a premium t-shirt price... I might not like it in a few days... I'll skip"". This behaviour is especially so with the added idea that I'm possibly buying a t-shirt nobody else likes, it makes me think maybe it's just a crappy t-shirt.<p>Your site is a site that customers would constantly be coming back to, so while you might not make such a good margin on a $12.50 shirt vs. a $25 shirt, it would be made up for in the average customer purchasing 20 shirts a year vs. 5 if they had to be considerate about their purchases.<p>I'm not sure if I explained that well, if not I can try and re-word it.",1345573038

Once that happened, it was relatively quick for that syntax to become a standardized interchange format for K-V data.<p>Lisp had assoc-lists, but those were a convention, not a specialized structure. Many languages had K-V maps as libraries, but not core structures, and most lacked literal syntax. Eventually most scripting languages starting getting them as native, and even having literal syntax, but they weren't the ""go-to"" data structure for doing things. In Python, for example, all of its objects are really just hash maps, but when you're working with them you pretend that they're objects and not hash maps, and you use lists more than maps anyways.<p>JavaScript (and maybe Lua) was the first language to build itself around K-V maps, so it was the first language where idiomatic usage included a lot of map literals. Like Python, its objects were all really just maps, but unlike it encouraged taking advantage of that fact. Also, because it was on the web, there was a lot of need to be serializing data structures and passing them around.

As long as it is only used on one computer at a time. In some cases they sold three licenses to a box but I'm not sure if that was three keys in the same box or one key that could be used three times. I never bought one of those.<p>Any other method of getting a license to Windows may not allow transfer. So, again this is how I understand it, if you buy a pre-built computer then that license of Windows can be tied to that computer and cannot be transferred. That's mostly what I'm meaning by being tied to the hardware.<p>The reason I understand it this way is because that pre-built computer would most likely have an OEM version of Windows installed. Since the OEM license cannot be transferred then the resulting customer cannot do that as well. Which is grossly unfair to that customer.<p>There's also the possibility this is because of a license agreement with the company that sold you the computer and not an agreement with Microsoft. So a license to Windows may be an agreement between you and the computer builder and not Microsoft. Which is also a stupid situation to put a customer in because they may not understand the difference.<p>Granted, this seems to be a ""depends"" thing. For example, I have used the license key from an old laptop that's no longer used to install WinXP on a different computer that I built out of old parts for my kids. But I'm also assuming that the key on the laptop is for the full retail version of XP and not the OEM version. Although Gateway may be unhappy with the situation but I think it unfair for me not to be able to reuse the key (that I paid for) when the original laptop no longer functions and is not worth repairing because it is around twelve years old.<p>In the end, when I buy a license to Windows I should be able to install it wherever I wish as long as I stick to the number of allowed active installs. Regardless of how I obtained that key. Well, I guess if they claim they gave me the key for free I can sort of understand but would still disagree.<p>I'm not a lawyer either, just a consumer stuck in legalese crap.",1345572545

This one seems to be in check for now.<p>I see the voting system as one of the problems.  More accurately, the obvious emotional or fanboi voting trends along some topics.  Blind down-voting, as I see it, is a problem.  If you down-vote you ought to be required to provide an explanation, otherwise, don't.  Topics such as many subjects surrounding Apple draw in people who will mercilessly down-vote well reasoned comments simply because they happen to be anti-Apple.  The same applies to the occasional political discussion in which anything that isn't aligned with liberal thinking is castigated.<p>The biggest problem I see with this is that it does not promote intelligent contrasting posts.  Those with different opinions either leave (or stop posting) or fall-in with the crowd and choose to become part of the collective.

All their other categories of problem questions make sense, but trying to ban questions that are too controversial or involve opinions is IMHO unwise - that's <i>exactly</i> the sort of question which leads to engaging content on SO, even if some of it verges on a troll.

4413880,comment,4413277,4413837,4,0,corin_,,,"When it comes to marketing technical stuff, I'm on the fence. As someone who works in marketing, and whose inner geek loves tech stuff, I agree with you in principle - however my experience has shown me plenty of people who really know little about what they're selling and yet do a fantastic job. Possibly the reverse of this experience is that maybe they're better at short-term sales, worse at actually giving customers what they want and therefore worse at keeping customers, I suspect this is the case.<p>But anyway, when I was talking about good marketers who don't understand tech stuff, I didn't mean people who are marketing the same tech products (such as Twilio). For example I was speaking to a client this morning, a fairly important guy in a company that makes certain types of consumer PC components. Ask him about several areas, such as PSUs, and he knows everything, in so much detail. But my conversation this morning was helping him work out who in his company he needed to speak to about creating a small landing page, and how to get the subdomain he wants. He doesn't know the meaning of any of the following: ""DNS"", ""IP"", ""sub-domain"". Great at marketing, great at understanding the products he markets, but if he had an idea that involved any coding, he wouldn't have a clue.",1345572208

I think they seem elegant, but mixing logic and HTML is actually just a great way to do things.  When you want to change something you see in the HTML  be it dynamic or static  then you always know where to look.  And when you come back to some code 6 months later you'll really appreciate the simplicity.<p>Even in Javascript traditional templates have seen a surge in popularity, even though push-style templates have always been the more natural way to operate (in the case of Javascript, modifying the DOM directly).",1345572203

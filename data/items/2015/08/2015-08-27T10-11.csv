Libraries make wonderful showcases for OOP strengths - I always like to give Java Collections as an example. But if you actually build your application code as OOP... well, I might privately think you deserve everything that happens to you because of that.<p>I think education carries most of the guilt for this. The typical examples given in OOS classes are stuff like Car is an ancestor of Truck and SportsCar. Which led to Beans and Entreprise Java. You never want this kind of shit with your data. Much better to use plain old maps to carry content the way God intended, and to put your effort in creating flexible and reusable methods.",1440673167

After much reading on PG essays, Sam A interviews and YC demographic (young male founders), the odds are against us. Last week&#x27;s NY Times article on Amazon culture, reminded me of YC. There are few similarities in concepts (work life balance, female discriminations). YCF was targeted for young founders (Sam&#x27;s interview mentioned low burn rate). I understand that startup life is hard, but thinking that older people will find it harder to cope is very naive. There are lots of new innovations that can be developed with the experiences and knowledges from older founders. True that there have been some young extraordinary unicorns.

10128606,comment,10126931,10128483,0,0,nindalf,,,"In my opinion, residents of J&K already get a number of privileges that other states don&#x27;t. For example, laws passed by Parliament don&#x27;t apply there until they&#x27;re ratified by the State Assembly. Granting them additional autonomy and privileges isn&#x27;t simple, because it doesn&#x27;t square with the Constitution&#x27;s tenet that all citizens are equal and deserve equal protection of laws. For example, Kashmiris can own property in the rest of India but other Indians can&#x27;t own property in Kashmir.<p>You correctly call into question the agreement signed by the Maharaja of Kashmir, but I could just as easily ask about every other territory that&#x27;s a part of the Union of India. Why should the writ of New Delhi run to places where the people are ethnically, linguistically and culturally different, such as Tamil Nadu? After all, at no point did Tamils accede to the Union and they have suffered discrimination before - such as when Delhi tried to impose Hindi on a Tamil-speaking population in 1965. Do Tamils deserve special privileges then? No, that&#x27;s absurd.<p>To clarify, I think Article 370 that grants Kashmir special status should be scrapped, because they don&#x27;t deserve special treatment. Apart from that, I think a referendum should be held there. I don&#x27;t think it will bury the issue (look at Scotland), but it will mollify most people who live there for some time.",1440672732

Good luck backing those monitors against something solid. Crunch.<p>- Weight. Trucking companies do things like switch to &#x27;super singles&#x27; (a double-wide tire in place of tandems) to save a few pounds. They wouldn&#x27;t be likely to embrace hanging 4 monitors plus whatever extra gear is needed to power & protect them.<p>- Compatibility. Trailers currently have standardized connectors for air, power, and signaling (turn signals + ABS + GPS if trailer so equipped). This would need a non-standard connector or at least a secondary one for video.<p>- Visibility. Nice squeaky clean trucks in the video. What happens a few hours down the road, or in snow when the front grille and trailer rear end are covered in spray, sand, and/or ice?<p>- Anti-theft. I&#x27;ve picked up trailers in so-called &#x27;highly secure&#x27; yards with 24/7 guards and CCTV, and the trailers were missing basic things like brake lights, tires, even the little rubber seals on the air brake connectors that cost pennies to replace. How long to these monitors remain on your trailer when you park in say West Memphis or Baltimore and go inside to eat and shower.<p>It&#x27;s an interesting idea and I commend the engineers for producing a partial solution, even if highly impractical for real-world use. Needs much more work though.<p>Also, watching that demo video the first thing that jumped out at me was how incredibly close the cars were when they cut back in front of the trucks. They filled the displays in the rear, I&#x27;d say they were about 1.5 - 2 line markers distant at speed. Incredibly dangerous for the cars, hope no one ever does that in normal driving. If you are that close to the nose of a truck and need to brake, you are getting squashed and there&#x27;s nothing the trucker can do to help you. They&#x27;ll be lucky to see you, and definitely won&#x27;t be able to see your taillights yet. You also just annoyed them by triggering the safety cutout on their cruise control which they&#x27;ll have to reset each time. This is logged and after too many of these they get called in to talk to a safety manager about their &#x27;tailgating problem&#x27;.",1440672576

In the name of <i>what</i> are you demanding experimental evidence for one interpretation, and not the other?<p>> <i>Infinite uncountable infinities of universes is not parsimonious.</i><p>You need to remember that those universes are in no way postulated.  They are <i>derived</i> —from the equations.  So you can&#x27;t use that impressive infinity to claim that the Many World interpretation would somehow have a higher Kolmogorov complexity than Copenhagen.<p>Many Worlds just takes the equations and run with them.  It&#x27;s Copenhagen that makes additional assumptions by manipulating the results of the equations: They&#x27;re not real, or there&#x27;s a collapse… Either way, that&#x27;s an additional hypothesis on top of those equations (which by the way have massive amounts of experimental evidence behind them, and are accepted by everyone as the current best guess).  That additional hypothesis is not very parsimonious, don&#x27;t you think?<p>(You have to remember how Occam&#x27;s razor really works.  From the Wikipedia,  &quot;The principle states that among competing hypotheses that predict equally well, the one with the fewest assumptions should be selected.&quot;  As a simple matter of fact, Many Worlds makes strictly fewer assumptions than Copenhagen. Parsimony is not measured by the size of the universe predicted by the theory.  Parsimony is measured by the number of core assumptions.  Not the same thing at all.)<p>To get a feel of how utterly ridiculous collapse postulates are (in 20/20 hindsight, I don&#x27;t want to make fun of physicists), I must quote Eliezer Yudkowsky: <a href=""http://lesswrong.com/lw/q6/collapse_postulates/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://lesswrong.com/lw/q6/collapse_postulates/</a><p><i>If collapse actually worked the way its adherents say it does, it would be:</i><p><i>1.

Yes, it&#x27;s true that they haven&#x27;t helped the homeless and that some benefits accrue to elites (e.g. you mention the finance sector).<p>That is what <i>normally</i> happens when one tries to implement collectivism. People think that places like Sweden and Germany are not corrupt like this, and that may be true, but the U.S. is really a third-world country (like Latin America), not like Germany or Sweden---just with a minority Anglo-Saxon-style pro-liberty subculture layered on top. So of course collectivism gets implemented in a much more corrupt way than what might &quot;theoretically&quot; be possible.<p>Also, I recognize that the mainstream Democrats want to go towards even more collectivism more slowly than Warren or Sanders or a &quot;true socialist.&quot; And may not want as pure of a form. So there is a difference, but it&#x27;s just a difference of degree. Also, it&#x27;s true that the Democrats don&#x27;t have a coherent ideology, but nonetheless, they still clearly represent collectivism and move in a collectivist direction. And I agree that they are not that different from most Republicans. Most Republicans concede having a welfare state and just want to do it more slowly and to a lesser degree, which, again, is just a difference in degree, not quality. The Republicans are not defenders of individualism; they do not <i>really</i> oppose collectivism; they just create temporary setbacks for Democrats.<p>edit: This is just to clarify where I am so you can answer the other comment (if you want), not to argue.<p>Also, I just want to say, since I started writing these two comments, I lost 12 karma all at once, so apparently somebody just went through and downvoted <i>all</i> my recent comments (all of which were in positive territory before, and none of them are inflammatory).

So, in short, that seems to comprise of a very small, very insignificant, set of social biases.<p>> My issue with the way gender equality is currently discussed is that people deny the existence of biological differences and their consequences, treating everything as baseless cultural bias that needs to be conquered.<p>That&#x27;s not how it&#x27;s discussed. It&#x27;s just that there is very little evidence that biological differences are a significant cause of the great power inequality we see in society between the sexes and among the races, and a lot of evidence to suggest that mutable social biases are by far the dominant cause. So there&#x27;s very little reason to talk about the biological differences if so far they&#x27;ve not been shown to be too pertinent to the discussion of inequality.<p>> Which happens equally on both sides of the issue, and that makes the whole topic toxic.<p>But there is a big knowledge gap. Those in favor of feminism, while not immune from assholishness -- at least have decades of study to at least support the premise of their position, while those against have just their own personal feelings on the matter.<p>> they have to agree with observable reality - otherwise, they&#x27;re just results of crap research.<p>They do.<p>> I&#x27;ve never personally seen being invoked, by either side<p>They&#x27;re invoked often by the only side that has them.

I don&#x27;t really understand why they were so desperate to release in July? Surely it would have made more sense to push back to October (Threshold 2 release window) or maybe even into 2016 when they can have a proper v1 version of Edge and more features in things like Groove Music which lacks even basic library management features like editing a songs tags.<p>Then we have the UI which is an inconsistent mess.

In Gujarat, 27% of seats are reserved for OBC (Other Backward Castes), 7.5% for Scheduled Castes and 15% for Scheduled Tribes for a total of 49.5% of all seats. The Supreme Court has capped the maximum reservation at 50% in their 1992 judgement.</i><p>What decides if you are OBC, SC, or ST? Your surname, and the community your family belongs to. Note that membership to one of these segments used to strongly correlate once with lower economic status (and therefore opportunities), but in recent years this correlation is significantly weaker.<p>The agitation is a result of the unsustainable caste politics quoted above. 49.5% of people getting in through a quota is <i>absurd</i>. Now I think that elevating downtrodden sections of society (through economic incentives, or even a reasonable quota) is a good thing. but when <i>half</i> of all seats in universities and stable government jobs are tied to a quota, the playing field for the &quot;general category&quot; is significantly shrunk, and people are going to get frustrated.<p>The community that is protesting are the Patels. They are huge in Gujarat; they&#x27;re all over the strong middle class spectrum, and parts of the upper class. What I mean to say is that they are not even remotely an oppressed downtrodden segment of society. They happen to be an entrepreneurial and dynamic class; if you&#x27;re in the UK or the US, you probably are aware of Patels because they constitute a huge percentage of Indian immigrants/expats.
My point being: Patels asking for reservation is ridiculous.
I guess only in India can a community <i>demand</i> to be labelled as &quot;backward&quot;.<p>But when the playing field is so small, is it a surprise that everyone now wants their own space carved out?<p>I hope this protest will die, because animosity between such a large segment of society and others can become a source of problems in the future. But I also hope that it will force the government to rethink the crazy huge reservation system.<p>People in Ahmedabad are feeling scared and angry right now. Just outside my parents&#x27; home, protestors/vandals lit three buses and a bus terminal on fire yesterday.

10128471,comment,10122656,10126162,0,0,javert,,,"> A true socialist favors workers owning enterprises.<p>> To repeat and sum-up the core point: socialism does not really care about taxation or regulation except as tools, it cares about workers owning their own tools, work-sites, materials, and enterprises, and thus controlling their own lives rather than being controlled by an owner.<p>Clearly you are talking about collectivism (as opposed to individualism), and the Democrats are collectivist. You just have this technical implementation difference.<p>Which is to have workers control enterprises by some sort of voting scheme. As opposed to the natural course of evolution from freedom to collectivism, where you would have &quot;private&quot; ownership of enterprises, but with the state controlling the owner through regulation and taxation.<p>That really is an implementation detail. There is a whole lot more that goes into a political system than just deciding how enterprises are managed. (And, by the way, it&#x27;s not any different to have your 99 fellow workers decide by voting how things are run, vs. a bureaucrat from a central government. So it&#x27;s also an <i>unimportant</i> implementation detail.)<p>I think that makes it pretty disingenious for Democrats to scream &quot;we are not socialists&quot; and socialists to say &quot;Democrats are not socialists.&quot; Because the people complaining about socialism don&#x27;t care about that technical implementation difference; that&#x27;s not actually the issue being raised. Rather, they are arguing against collectivism.<p>People in general use &quot;socialism&quot; to mean &quot;collectivism,&quot; and I think that&#x27;s perfectly fine, because people in general don&#x27;t (and shouldn&#x27;t) care about some obscure implementation detail that is being argued over by true believers.<p>If you have an argument against what I&#x27;ve said here, I&#x27;d be interested to see it, but I&#x27;d rather get something really specific and targeted vs. more of a soapbox.",1440669748

At first the office manager arranging things would ask me details about which airline and which flights I&#x27;d prefer after listing the options, and which hotels, describing address and location and how near they were the office.

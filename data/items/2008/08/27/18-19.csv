288358,comment,287851,288096,0,0,donw,,,"Right, so the Samurai, who would randomly cut the heads off of people they didn't fancy, knew they were doing something wrong, and yet were totally okay with it?  Beheading a few peasants was, after all, the right way to test out a new sword... there's even a term in Japanese for it: Tameshi-giri.<p>Plenty of societies, both ancient and modern, have legalized, or even encouraged, what we define as 'murder'.<p>And note that I'm <i>not</i> arguing that murder is acceptable; rather, that the definition for it changes so much between societies as to make the statement ""Murder is wrong in all human societies."" a completely meaningless phrase.<p>A likely explanation for the prohibition against the killing of other humans is strictly pragmatic: Societies where members can kill each other freely will self-destruct.  This has nothing to do with 'murder being wrong', as much as free homicide not being a very stable evolutionary path.",1219863510

They generally have more business than they can handle, so they don't need to rip you off, and getting caught doing so (which would happen the minute you spoke to another one) would have seriously negative consequences, up to getting disbarred.<p>Of course just like doctors, it cannot hurt to get second opinion, because lawyers are of course not all ethical or infallible.",1219863314

One way is to take a rule that arbitrary parties would agree to in advance (e.g. ""If a car belongs to A, B can't just drive off in it without being penalized""). The other set of laws involves taking some government program (whether of the 'shoot at people in the Third World' or the 'write a check to people who are doing some particular kind of good' variety) and subvert it to maximize profits.<p>You don't stay in business very long if you violate A, and you can only do B when the government is rich enough to rob.",1219862754

288340,comment,287851,287953,0,0,donw,,,"Surprisingly, a large chunk of my friends are civil attorneys, and you know what?  They all really care about serving their clients, and view themselves as champions of justice.  Sure, there are scummy lawyers, just as their are lousy programmers, but I can't think of a single attorney that I've ever met, who <i>wants</i> to screw his clients over.<p>Especially in corporate law.  If they do a good job at drafting your contracts and defending you in court against copyright infringement suits, you'll come back, and recommend your other business-people friends to that attorney's practice.<p>Of course, your attorney will want to disembowel the opposing side, but that's what you <i>want</i>.<p>If you're worried about an attorney, look at their track record; unlike a lot of other professions, you can get all of it from the courthouse in the district where they practice.  If you don't know where to start looking for a lawyer, call your local bar association, and ask them for a referral.<p>Or, if you've got very little money, look at Pre-Paid Legal Services.  Yes, yes, it started as an MLM company, which looks pretty scummy, but they actually do provide a very, very useful set of services, and the total cost is less than  twenty bucks a month.<p>It just makes me sad to see lawyers catching all the flack for the problems in our judicial system, when it's our elected officials who created the whole nightmare in the first place.",1219862578

They want to see your company get really big and give them steady M&A business for the next 30 years.<p>Only choosing a non-sharky Lawyer is much easier than a non-sharky VC.  Go to some reputable law firms, tell them about your company, listen to them, and go with the one you like.  If you haven't figured this out yet then it probably means that you have very little to be ""screwed"" out of anyways so you won't have to worry about them doing that.<p>Mentally masturbating over legal issues you'll never understand in a bootstrapped startup is just as impractical as not trusting landlords and insisting on building your own office.<p>If done right you will get a rough feel for legal issues as you go.

The length of the JD, a doctorate, is 3 years; Ph.D.s tend to be 4 or 5 (or 6 or ...), and an MD, 4.<p>Short of someone who's done all three degrees, my estimate is probably pretty good.

You could say I have a bit of knowledge about this.<p>Perhaps you didn't mean to reply to my post, but rather to someone else's.

6825311,comment,6825158,6825206,6,0,nrodhn,,,"I hear you, but not being sexist can be pretty hard. I always felt that obviously, I wasn&#x27;t sexist: I like working with women in the workplace, I always figured we make software for everyone so it&#x27;s probably best if everyone makes software, and so on. I&#x27;ve been fortunate to have female co-workers who I felt made terrific colleagues, both skills-wise and socially.<p>And yet one day one of them pulled me aside and explained to me what exactly I was doing that was making being at her job harder. It wasn&#x27;t something I did intentionally, it wasn&#x27;t because I thought ill of her, it was just that I didn&#x27;t think much at all. I behaved differently toward her (and, I guess, other female developers) because I had a set of assumptions I automatically brought to bear against male developers I wasn&#x27;t sure applied to her, and it affected my behavior in ways that kept singling her out and making her feel uncomfortable.<p>One of the most embarassing, humbling and in retrospect, valuable moments in my professional life.<p>I&#x27;m happy it went that way instead of a complaint followed by me losing my job. I think a lot of male developers don&#x27;t want to be sexist, but we need to learn what that actually means in practice, and it&#x27;s not as intuitive as you make it out to be. Wasn&#x27;t for me at least.",1385855988

6825309,comment,6824879,6824879,11,0,Futurebot,,,"A lot of this is covered in the excellent book &quot;The Cheating Culture&quot;, which I recommend. &quot;Bowling Alone&quot;, as the article mentions, covers the &quot;stay home and do your own thing&quot; part of it, but the economic system we&#x27;ve set up, I believe, is far a far stronger influence. We&#x27;ve set up a system that&#x27;s dog-eat-dog, every man for himself, &quot;everything that happens to you is your own fault&quot;, &quot;lift yourself up by your bootstraps&quot; and approaching hypercompetition. When it feels like you&#x27;re one medical emergency, job loss, or bad debt away from homelessness, and have only pathetic (and painted as only for life&#x27;s losers) safety nets there for you, you&#x27;re out of necessity going to have to trust less. Add in the fact that many areas in this country have to deal with the daily threat of violence, and you get a toxic brew of distrust.<p>This is sad for more than sentimental reasons, as the article mentions.

Saying we&#x27;d love to fire some &quot;asshole&quot; because he chose not to pull a pull request changing two instances of &quot;him&quot; to &quot;they&quot;?<p>First, let me get it out of the way that I actually agree with the pull request. In this day, the personal pronoun &quot;they&quot; makes a more inclusive pronoun that just &quot;him&quot;.  Zed Shaw&#x27;s suggestion of &quot;you&quot; is also a good alternative, particularly if you&#x27;re wanting to be less formal.<p>That said, let me note that many of us were taught in school that using &quot;he&quot; here is the preferred pronoun.  And that&#x27;s just one reason why I can imagine why someone would reject this pull request.  Because as much as I agree with the PR, I have the ability to conceive of other perspectives.  We have no idea why Ben chose to reject the request.<p>1.  Maybe he thought it was incorrect grammar.  I disagree, since there&#x27;s a strong history of singular, third-person use of &quot;they&quot; in English.  But it&#x27;s what we were taught.<p>2.  Maybe he&#x27;s overwhelmed with issues and pull requests, and thinks this is too trivial of a matter and doesn&#x27;t want to encourage this kind of contribution to the project.<p>3.  I can think of about 3-4 other valid reasons, but I won&#x27;t bore you.<p>Bottom line, this has all the characteristics of a witch hunt.  Joyent is OK with taking away a man&#x27;s livelihood because he chose not to accept a two-word commit, and one that didn&#x27;t even deal with code?  Not only that, but to publically call him an asshole?<p>I&#x27;m all for making small steps toward gender equality like this one, but calling someone who doesn&#x27;t share that opinion vulgar names and wanting to fire them is an altogether inappropriate move.",1385855830

Anyone who makes north of 3 million dollars a year probably makes more than $1000/hr.<p>$1000/hr is on the high-end for a lawyer, but would be on the low end for something like a professional speaker (or athlete, coach, CEO, hedge fund manager, or many other jobs).<p>Since Apple is the one complaining here, let&#x27;s look at what they would consider fair pay. Tim Cook got $4.2M in pay last year (which at a <i>very</i> respectable 2,500 hours billed for an attorney would be $1,680 an hour). Sounds exorbitant in Apple&#x27;s words, but it&#x27;s mere pocket change to the 1 million shares of AAPL he got in 2011 for getting the CEO gig--currently worth a cool $556m. If you want to average across the full 10 year vesting period at the same 2,500 hours a year it still comes out to an awesome $22,240 an hour. That&#x27;s not completely fair because it doesn&#x27;t include the $50M or so he&#x27;ll make during the 10 year period and it&#x27;s possible AAPL will fail and his shares will devalue greatly. It&#x27;s also possible they will at least stick with the S&P 500 and his shares will be worth a good bit more.<p>tl;dr yes, lots of people are worth $1000/hr and actually a whole whole lot more. Apple is fighting just because they can, which is actually the entire reason they took this all the way to a trial (and lost!). If they wanted to save money they would have settled when caught red handed.

It&#x27;s a lot of work, that takes a lot of arcane knowledge.<p>So&#x27;s doing a photorealistic painting of a thing. You have to look at the thing, consider a bunch of relationships of the particular feature you&#x27;re interested in at this very moment, and transfer those relationships to your canvas. That&#x27;s a pretty complicated set of habits and brain circuitry you have to build up over a period of years.<p>Tracing an image is immensely easier. There&#x27;s all the perspective, there&#x27;s all the proportion relationships. There&#x27;s all the colors. Right there in front of you. You can spend an hour or two essentially doing manual edge-detection, and then start filling in areas.<p>There&#x27;s still stuff to learn - how to mix the paint to get the colors you want, how to apply it to the canvas, stuff like that. And if you trace organic stuff <i>too</i> closely, it starts to look stiff and dead. But compared to the amount of skill you have to learn to draw this kind of stuff out of your head? It&#x27;s nothing.<p>I mean, hell. Take a photo, print it out. Tape it to a sunny window, tape another piece of paper over it, and trace it. Then take that same photo and try to draw a copy of it, without tracing. There will be a huge difference between the two drawings you just made. The one made without tracing will probably have taken a lot longer, and have many more bits erased and redrawn.<p>A lot of modern artists have this weird thing going on with respect to tracing. It&#x27;s the worst thing ever, they&#x27;ll say. Tracing another person&#x27;s work to learn from, or tracing off of a photo, they&#x27;re different kinds of art crimes, but they&#x27;re still art crimes. Leaping around learning to break a scene down in your head and reconstruct it from scratch - essentially building a wetware 3D modeller in your brain, really - is considered CHEATING by some people.<p>So Hockney&#x27;s book on Vermeer&#x27;s work is essentially saying &quot;dude Vermeer was totally a tracer&quot;. Which in many artist&#x27;s eyes is like calling him Not An Artist. Artists get weird about what is Art and what is Not Art, it&#x27;s this whole thing that&#x27;s about as inexplicable to a layperson as a programmer&#x27;s choice of text editor.<p>By using mirrors and lenses to project an image onto his camera to trace, Vermeer only had to learn the basic painting technique stuff. If he did, if he traced all this stuff, then some people will start saying that his work is no longer Art. It&#x27;s just Illustration. Which, in the eyes of people who care about this, means that it is a lower, less respectable thing. Now it&#x27;s just a filter applied to an image, albiet manually instead of via Photoshop or whatever.<p>The truth of the matter (IMHO) is that a lot of the people who will scream bloody murder when someone is tracing are amateurs. Real pros can and will project images and work over them, build reference models in the real world or in 3D programs, and do any damn thing they can to make the hard parts of their work easier, to get all those little details they&#x27;d never make up out of whole cloth.<p>I am pretty sure I&#x27;ve repeated myself a couple times here, thanks to the tiny window HN allows to type in. But hopefully this helps.<p>tl;dr: If Vermeer used these techniques then he&#x27;s a dirty cheating TRACER and is thus not a REAL ARTIST in some people&#x27;s eyes.",1385855172

If I had to say what &quot;side&quot; I&#x27;m on, I&#x27;d say I&#x27;m on the side of inclusivity and I&#x27;m happy to state a clear preference for the removal of gender-exclusive language from source code comments.

If we believe that everyone really does divide into the two camps of totalitarian feminists and reactionary chauvinists then I&#x27;m going to be attacked by both sides.

Up until college I collected a decent sized library of books and a few shelves of professional books since then. My personal library fills up a small bedroom comfortably. It&#x27;s not fancy, a little over a half dozen IKEA bookshelves, packed to the ceiling with books that decorate the room. My books are roughly arranged by personal theme, not any formal system. Books on ancient history on these shelves, light sci-fi/fantasy on these, serious literature here, technical references on these, etc.<p>But about 3 or 4 years ago it just...<i>stopped</i>. Pretty much everything I want to read through leisure is digital, and almost all of my professional needs likewise.<p>I realized that what I liked about libraries was not just the books, but the notion that it&#x27;s a place to collect knowledge, organize it, make it available -- to celebrate knowledge. I decided to move a small desk, a chair, some lights, my NAS, a wifi router and an old laptop to control the digital bits. My library now has gone high tech and I think it fits right in with the book collection. I put my CDs, DVDs, etc. in the same room.<p>I now access all of my collected data, from my library either digitally or physically from Tablets around my home. It&#x27;s cleaned up lots of the rest of my house and makes a kind of cognitive sense to do it this way.

(In other words, I trust the statistics behind the article, which come from the federal government&#x27;s National Social Survey.)<p>The article includes some dire warnings about decline of social trust in the United States during the last forty years, and also some ideas about how social trust can increase. &quot;People do get a little more trusting as they age. But beginning with the baby boomers, each generation has started off adulthood less trusting than those who came before them.&quot; I daresay it is correct that MOST Americans become more trusting as they age. In my middle age, I feel very comfortable both in the community I live in and as I travel about the United States. (I have been to all of the fifty United States, and to other territories of my country.)<p>To take the article seriously, and to suggest a possible help that was not suggested in the article, I will propose for your thoughtful discussion (I trust you here on Hacker News) one policy that might help. Let&#x27;s take care of the economic gap problem mentioned in the article and some other factors that harm social trust by building all of the public school systems in the United States on the foundational principle of family choice. I have seen an example of how this policy could help where I live. Minnesota, where I now live and where I grew up, has had largely equal per-capita funding for public school pupils statewide since the 1970s. That reduces the effect of family income differences on the availability of adequately funded schools. The state law change that made most school funding come from general state appropriations rather than from local property taxes was called the &quot;Minnesota miracle.&quot;[1] Today most funding for schools is distributed by the state government on a per-pupil enrollment basis.[2]<p>The funding reform in the 1970s was followed up by two further reforms in the 1980s. First, the former compulsory instruction statute in Minnesota was ruled unconstitutional in a court case involving a homeschooling family, and a new compulsory instruction statute explicitly allows more nonpublic school alternatives for families who seek those. Second, the Legislature, pushed by the then Governor, set up statewide open enrollment[3] and the opportunity for advanced learners to attend up to two years of college while still high school students on the state&#x27;s dime.[4] And Minnesota also has the oldest charter school statute in the United States.[5]<p>Parents in Minnesota now have more power to shop than parents in most states. That gets closer to the ideal of detecting the optimum education environment for each student (by parents observing what works for each of their differing children) and giving it to them by open-enrolling in another school district (my school district has inbound open-enrollment students from forty-one other school districts of residence) or by homeschooling, or by postsecondary study at high school age, or by exercising other choices. And I think that builds social trust by making school communities more nearly communities of choice than communities of compulsion.<p>The educational results of Minnesota schools are well above the meager results of most United States schools, and almost competitive (but not fully competitive) with the better schools in the newly industrialized countries of east Asia and southeast Asia. And the social trust level in Minnesota seems to be above the United States national average, although I&#x27;d have to check the National Social Survey data to be sure about that. A good country to compare in this regard to the United States would be the Netherlands, which by its constitution has had pervasive school choice for the last century.<p>[1] <a href=\"http://www.mnhs.org/library/tips/history_topics/18public.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.mnhs.org/library/tips/history_topics/18public.htm...</a><p>[2] <a href=\"http://www.house.leg.state.mn.us/hrd/pubs/mnschfin.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.house.leg.state.mn.us/hrd/pubs/mnschfin.pdf</a><p><a href=\"http://education.state.mn.us/MDE/SchSup/SchFin/index.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://education.state.mn.us/MDE/SchSup/SchFin/index.html</a><p>[3] <a href=\"http://education.state.mn.us/MDE/StuSuc/EnrollChoice/index.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://education.state.mn.us/MDE/StuSuc/EnrollChoice/index.h...</a><p>[4] <a href=\"http://education.state.mn.us/MDE/StuSuc/CollReadi/PSEO/index.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://education.state.mn.us/MDE/StuSuc/CollReadi/PSEO/index...</a><p>[5] <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Zero-Chance-Passage-Pioneering-Charter/dp/1592984762/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.amazon.com/Zero-Chance-Passage-Pioneering-Charter...</a>",1385852998

But after 3-4 generations, when children of rich parents have inherent advantages (education, connections etc) which are extremely hard to overcome, this system starts becoming unstable.",1385852776

Less socializing and fewer community meetings&quot;</i><p>Americans have just as many social and community interactions as ever -- but a much higher percentage are semi-broadcasts through social media.<p>Hanging out with your friends at the bowling league, you might be a little bit cautious about expressing political views, and when there is disagreement it will be set aside by the tenth frame.  As a result, people learned to trust each other in spite of disagreement.  Online, certain views tend to be broadcast, and when there is disagreement it often turns into a quick unfriending and behind-the-back trash talking about what an intolerant jerk the ex-friend is.  As a result, people learn that outsiders are bad people who should never ever be trusted.",1385852764

Now they turn that on it&#x27;s head - of course, not liking people is OK, if it&#x27;s the feminists who do the not liking.<p>Edit 2: another thing, she should read some books by Dan Ariely. Turns out the &quot;rational theory of crime&quot; (claiming people commit crimes because they are unlikely to be caught or punished) does not explain things very well. Iirc people commit crimes because they can rationalize that they are still good people if they do so, for example they might feel they somehow deserve it, they see others doing it so they feel entitled to it, too, stuff like that.",1385852650

Additionally in Germany (that&#x27;s very German) there are universities of applied science (Fachhochschulen) which give a very applied course of studies. There are even some more more exotic ways of getting higher education (vocational academy/university of cooperative education (Berufsakademie)). Thus in Germany you go to university since you want this kind of education, not because there are hardly any alternatives.

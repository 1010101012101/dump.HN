547805,comment,547496,547750,0,0,ilkhd2,,,"Not necessarily. 
Sometimes, the very structure (syntactic I mean) of language
makes ceratin kinds of abstractions (behavior abtractions as well) veryhard to implement, which is effectively same as having no way to express them.
I mean, for example - there is no way, absolutely no way to write Lapack benchmark in Ruby to be as fast as C one in reasonable amount of time (you can always emit machine code and run afterwards, but that is cheating). Or less controversial example: Java VM has no tail recursion optimisation, and for example Clojure does not have either. That means you have no way to use certain class of programmin techniques with it,
As a conclusion: languages largely prescribe the way to implement architecture with them.",1238968633

According to the Navy report the problem is not currently solved.<p>It's not just Chinese who figured it out either, two decades ago Russians started re-arming their strategic nuclear arsenal with Topol-M which in its latest versions is also a maneuvering ballistic missile.<p>And then of course there is the very old trick of multiple warheads per missile (some decoy) - these are impossible to shoot down as there are far too may of them at once. Chinese have demonstrated to world their ability to do this when they launched multiple satellites with one rocket - the same technology. This particular missile may not be using it though.<p>Due to both maneuvering and multiple warheads the entire missile-defense thinking has moved from intercepting missiles at target to intercepting missiles at launch or in flight.<p>Obviously at 2000km away the AC is not in a position to intercept the launch of the missile.<p>It is not a solved problem you make it out to be. And the article's meta-point is that in the arms race of armor vs bullet, the bullet seems to be winning in the historical perspective.",1238968504

Quite the opposite considering they fund a great deal of work on the Rubinius ruby implementation effort.<p>Generalizations like ""ruby falls down at high throughput"" are fun to echo but a poor basis for planning architecture. The constraints of the tools you're using matters, but so does the overall pattern of how you're applying them.<p>Efficiency is a property of languages. Stability and Scalability are properties of architectures. Design is the process of fitting one to the other, and requires real actual thought, work and measurement, not just repeating chestnuts.",1238965742

So you need to have a destroyer paired up with an AC.<p>Now while the Aegis system is truly kickass, it has yet to be used in wartime, excluding shooting down an Iranian civilian aircraft (oops!).<p>The air superiority that aircraft carriers provide is pretty cool too. But go back and read the War Nerd's posts and he goes through how a how defensless AC's really are from non-traditional adversaries.",1238965493

If I was China, I'd be building a few squadrons of those things.  (You could even have them leave the missile behind in the water, to pop up and launch itself towards the group at a predetermined time, making it much harder to find the launch platform.)",1238965462

Air supremacy does not solve that, and there is currently no defense against such a swarm.<p>Everyone thought battleships were invincible until they turned out to be exactly USELESS with the advent of good carrier-based airplanes.  Its quite possible that the anti-ship missile, in large deployments in a post-war declaration period, has done this to the carrier.<p>Even though the Japanese were smart enough to launch the attack on Pearl harbor, the US and Japanese navies were both certain their battleships would be important in the upcoming conflict, and the Japanese navy trained intensely for large scale night-battles among fleets of battleships.  Everyone woke up overnight to the fact that battleships were exactly useless, and it was a rude awakening.",1238965448

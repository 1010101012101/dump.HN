Later I branched out and did some Tcl and Python and have since pretty much converted to Rails for web stuff.  I also know C, Java at least in the context of Java ME for mobile stuff, and a bit of this, that, and the other thing (Erlang, Emacs lisp).<p>It all depends on what you want, of course, as I'm more of a jack of all trades, master of none kind of guy.<p>Of course, what the OP probably means is that these sort of random strings of technologies look, at times, a bit dubious.",1269169039

Try to focus these guys on the current solution not the situation.<p>So, maybe something like\n""Sorry, I didn't know you were expecting a report from me, but I am willing to provide you a report in 2 days"".<p>If you didn't do anything that is worth reporting, say so. :D<p>Here again focus them on the solution, say when you will get the scripts done.  If possible show them the monetary benefits of you being delayed. :D<p>Benefits:\n1)  You are an artist -  the delay has helped you to recharge your batteries so you can program effectively.  You might want to cite some research papers here.<p>2) You were using this time to show your juniors the ropes and you were bring them up to speed.  Which means the company will not only be fighting with one heavyweight, but also two in the future. You might want to outline the monetary advantages of having more people of your caliber.<p>Then you need to iterate this to them that you will get them the software by such and such a time. Don't ask, tell.<p>Also, what I think you should be doing for the future is maintaining constant communication with the upper level.  They will tend to think you aren't doing anything if you don't say.  Try to send an email a day to them informing them of the project, don't do this verbal; do it by email.\nIt will also help for you own motivation.

1207787,comment,1207494,1207494,0,0,InclinedPlane,,,"In many cases macro-optimization trumps micro-optimization. C/C++ might be closer to the metal and in extremely simple applications incrementally (or perhaps significantly) faster, but if the difficulty of using C for web app development results in an extremely sub-optimal solution then you'd have been better off with a more advanced language like Ruby or even Java.<p>Moreover, the long pole in almost every web application of any significance today is the database. Whether you're using C++ or PHP is irrelevant if just waiting on a SQL statement to execute dominates the performance of your app by an order of magnitude or more.<p>Additionally, there's frequently a lot of room for optimization in any web app. Techniques like CSS spriting, serving static content from a cookie-less domain, and aggressive caching can make far more of a difference to overall performance than choice of language.<p>Finally, throwing hardware at the problem almost always makes sense as long as you can get away with it. A $1500 server is roughly equivalent to the cost of a single day of development for a talented team of only 4 devs (keep in mind that the cost of employing developers includes not just their base salary but also other costs like administration, 401k matching, health insurance, payroll taxes, etc, which nearly doubles the nominal per hour cost). Until you're perhaps $20-50k in the hole it probably doesn't make sense to consider putting serious effort into re-engineering your software from the ground up for scalability.",1269167043

1207773,comment,1207725,1207725,0,0,swombat,,,"I don't think this is a good approach.<p>As an employer, I wouldn't want to invest the time in getting someone up to speed with my systems if they have no ""lock-in"" that means they'll stay with me until they've paid off for that initial ramp-up period (which would cost me time). I particularly wouldn't want to do so for someone who already has a job at a software company - I'd clearly be a distant second (if not third or fourth) priority in that person's life.<p>Next, about the profile - I suggest you pick a narrow specialty that you really want to work on (e.g. Ruby on Rails), and focus on that. I don't think many people, particularly start-ups, are interested in hiring a ""C#, Java, RoR, Silverlight, Ajax"" guy. That long list makes you look unfocused and implies that you probably suck at a lot of technologies rather than being very good at a few.<p>My suggestion to you would be: pick one technology with a thriving OS community (e.g. RoR), and contribute open-source software. That's one way to work for free that will greatly enhance your value to potential employers. Start a blog, talk about your experiences with Rails, promote your open-source projects, etc. You'll soon find paid work coming your way.",1269166055

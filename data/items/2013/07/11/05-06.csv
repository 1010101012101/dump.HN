That may be a combination of different auto-pilot modes combined with auto-throttle modes.<p>But what seems clear is that the moment that the pilot turned off auto-pilot, the flight was doomed to crash as the auto-throttle was not in the right mode for landing.  As in, a mode that would actually use thrust vs elevators to maintain airspeed.<p>NTSB also revealed that course corrections were being done not at the latest moment of 500 feet, but at 4000 feet 2.5 minutes before landing the plane was off course, in which case supervision, and correction would have been appropriate in a training scenario.<p>I hate to draw conclusions like this, but in today&#x27;s modern aircraft pilots only fly about 20-30 mins of a flight, takeoff and landing at most with autopilot managing most of the rest under normal conditions.<p>The inability to hand fly an airliner, is a disqualifier to be a professional pilot.<p>NTSB revealed that several modes on autopilot and autothrottle were being cycled in the last 2.5 minutes of the Asiana descent perhaps indicating a reluctance to hand-fly the plane and an over-reliance on automation.<p>Any commercial pilot that cant hand-fly a 777 on a perfectly clear day at SFO should never see a commercial cockpit again.",1373522295

You have access to 100+ heroes from your first game and there isn&#x27;t a single thing you can buy that has an effect on winning or losing a match.  It&#x27;s all skins, alternate announcers, and other stuff just for fun.<p>LoL is free... to play.  There are a set of heroes that are free at any given time which is constantly rotating.  You have to pay to unlock heroes permanently or can unlock them very slowly over time.  You will never unlock everyone without paying money.  There are additional other systems you have to level up, or can pay to level more quickly, that provide small bonuses to character attributes in game.<p>This effects more than the price.<p>For example in Dota 2 one of my favorite modes is &quot;Reverse Draft&quot; where each team picks the OTHER team&#x27;s heroes.  So you try and give your opponent the worst team you can think of.  Something like this is impossible in LoL because every person only has access to a small set of heroes.",1373521156

I&#x27;m now of the opinion that Apple is probably guilty of antitrust violation. Judge Cote admits (on page 157) there&#x27;s nothing inherently wrong with MFN clauses, simultaneous negotiation, price caps, or any of Apple&#x27;s contracts. It&#x27;s even plausible Apple could have escaped culpability, were it not for evidence that Eddie Cue and Steve Jobs <i>knew</i> that the publishers already wanted to raise prices, and willfully provided them the opportunity.  An MFN clause was meant to protect Apple, but, <i>because</i> of Amazon&#x27;s artificially low prices, it also had the effect of tending to indirectly trigger an industry wide switch to the agency model with increased prices, and Apple expected this. It was this expectation that apparently elevated the act to conspiracy.<p>Despite that, I must admit, I feel ambivalent about the ruling.  Amazon&#x27;s below-cost retail pricing appeared to have otherwise prevented Apple from even attempting to enter the market, at all, unless they came up with some way to profit.

From my understanding the 25% desalination rate does not compound linearly and decreases in efficiency as the concentration of salt ions decreases.<p>Additionally their flow rate is 0.4 microlitres per minute, this would equate to needing 625 000 channels for one pass only to get 250mL / min. Scaling for microfluidics isn&#x27;t simply using a larger pipe size, microfluidic devices largely operate with minimal forces and a Reynolds number of 1, that doesn&#x27;t hold as you get larger.<p>The other big problem here is that this requires pressure driven flow, to do that they made two reservoirs of uneven height on opposite ends to drive flow. Again this is very electrically cheap (picowatts) when dealing with such small and perfect flow conditions.<p>The biggest problems they need to address are the low filtration rate and the low flow rate, it does not seem like there is a simple answer to the first, they do state that they are conducting a larger scale experiment that they will publish later.<p>I largely suspect that the larger scale experiment will fail in efficiency as another group (doi:10.1038/nnano.2010.34) who also uses a ion depletion zone (albeit by a different mechanism) found after publishing that they were orders of magnitude (10^3) too low in their predictions.<p>If anything this will perhaps be better than small, portable RO setups but not replace large factories which are actually pretty efficient.",1373520332

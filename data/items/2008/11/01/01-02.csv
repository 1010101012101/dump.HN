I would hardly equate the Air with the Zune though.  I think this list was set up to stir up controversy.<p>It almost feels like feeding the trolls, so Micah, while I respect your submitting the article, I cannot in good conscience mod it up =P",1225504222

(If you watch 10 hrs a day, that's almost 3 years).",1225503894

Sound familiar?  At first pass, this would seem like prime breeding ground for startups, but there are serious barriers to entry.<p>The biggest obstacle for new products is just that visually impaired users are taught to use JAWS from the get-go: they have the educational market.  Yes, they hate it, but when you can't see it's very hard to comparison shop.  All screen readers have a big learning curve.<p>Then, if someone could find your product, evaluate it, and like it, well... most people in the target market are not self-sufficient, and would not actually be able to pay for it.  (You would have to market to the charities and grant foundations that purchase the products for most users.)<p>Oh, and did I mention that it's not easy to write a screen reader in the first place?<p>As much as I would love to see a startup come into the arena here and change the rules, I think instead we just have to hope for the success of these various open-source projects, and be glad that there are people who take this problem very seriously and are working on it.<p>Until then, designers and programmers will have to cater to the various quirks of the market leaders.  This article is one of the best guidelines for that I've seen.",1225503708

You can see that on the Office page, but maybe we should make that more noticeable. We'll have more things too once we integrate some future features.<p>At the very end, much like Mob Wars, you'll have various virtual items and such. We'll probably mix in achievements and trophies and the like you can win. I should think more about that stuff.<p>Interesting thought about the friends, I'll try to think of that. Might be a really good idea if we can come up with a good implementation.<p>Tournaments are in the plans.<p>We've got some other unique forms of training coming up. I'll think about that though.<p>Thanks for all the great ideas.",1225502602

A car is a sculpture which just happens to be banged out of sheet metal instead of carved out of marble.<p>Admittedly it's hard to think of a Toyota as a sculpture, but a Lamborghini is definitely one.

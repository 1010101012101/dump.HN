Now it requires a large number of depositors in the same area to run on all the banks to cause an issue. The reason for this is that banks can a) lend to each other and b) borrow from the Fed banks. This means that more money is just a shipment away. And since the Fed is the government, it never runs out of money. It can just print more to cover the cost.",1233547122

It's much more likely that money could be taken from another area of costs than that the cost of wifi would affect ticket prices.<p>I'm not saying the money will appear out of nowhere, but it's certainly not staggering if the current charge structure is expected to create a profit for the company that installed the network.",1233546989

461823,comment,461296,461296,0,0,TooMuchNick,,,"The semi-social, semi-user-generated porn site fantasti.cc was created by a group of popular dot-commers (I know who but I can't tell) who have so far kept their names off the site. One of my partners at Boffery (a pre-alpha visual diary for sex lives) did some work for them, and that partner and I agree that the site would benefit from the name brands of the dot-commers.<p>In a supposedly enlightened modern world, and more importantly a world in which every man with a computer uses it several times a week to view porn and nearly every man and woman masturbates daily, is there really so much shame in being the person who provides those services?<p>I have no data on who the most financially successful sex aid and porn makers are, but we certainly all know of some success stories, and we know them by their legal names: Hugh Hefner, Sasha Grey, Larry Flynt. The founders of JimmyJane (a high-market sex toy maker and seller) are out in the open, as is their investor Tim Draper.<p>Sex sites aren't exactly parallel to porn sites, but it's the closest comparison I have. In its early days, Boffery will need every advantage I can give it, and one is my small amount of notoriety online (both as Nick Douglas and as ""the first editor of Valleywag"").<p>I've heard a few stories: FriendFinder calls itself a ""social network"" when talking to money people. JimmyJane has a different corporate name, but one still assumes Tim Draper knows exactly what he's investing in.<p>In short, if you don't want to be associated with your industry, you're at a huge disadvantage (your competitors will profit from risking more of their personal reputations) and possibly even have some moral questions to ask yourself. Why do you want to spend time profiting from anything if you feel it would taint your name?",1233546627
461822,comment,461654,461654,0,0,briansmith,,,"Most users will only use encrypted/signed email if encryption and signing is done automatically. If the automatic encryption/decryption/signing/verification is done by the server (e.g. GMail), security gurus will complain that it isn't secure enough.<p>If the encryption/decryption is done in the ""totally secure"" way on the client, users complain that they are locked out of their email too often (can't access it from a secondary location and/or lost their keys).<p>Average users don't have an effective method for exchanging keys.<p>Email security doesn't really work without a signing mechanism that results in nonrepudiation. But, a lot of users don't want nonrepudiation for the messages they send; they want nonrepudiation for the messages they receive and 100% repudiation for the messages they send. To implement that, you need some kind of expiring signing keys, separate from the encryption keys, which S/MIME and GPG UAs don't natively support.<p>Consumer-level email services are mostly webmail at this point. There is no good solution for securing webmail beyond TLS encryption between SMTP endpoints (e.g. between Google, Hotmail, and Yahoo, and between the browser and the server). However, your email is still just a subpoena away at every endpoint.<p>Server-side spam filtering doesn't work with encryption. As soon as spammers start using your encryption key, the spam will pass right through the filters. That means you need to keep your encryption key private. But, that makes key exchange and revocation checks even more difficult.<p>Online certificate revocation checks are important for email security. However, the process of doing the revocation check leaks sensitive information (who you are corresponding with) if it is optimized for performance. The current means of revocation checking that is optimized for privacy has unworkable performance issues. A new, nonstandard, mechanism for doing revocation checks is needed. But, everybody hates anything proprietery, so it would have to be standardized, but the standardization process will take years.<p>Everything related to internet email has been free/open source/public domain since the beginning. Any solution that someone comes up with will have to be opened up and freely given away--including the specifications and reference implementations--before it has any chance of being adopted. This limits revenues. Yet, you need a costly infrastructure to implement the service levels that users expect from email (99.9% uptime and high performance and pennies a day or free).<p>I have been working on a solution to most of these problems but I don't have the resources to move it forward. Please email me (brian@briansmith.org) if you are serious about coming up with improvements to everyday email security so that we can compare notes.",1233546608

461819,comment,461720,461720,0,0,3pt14159,,,"Imagine a nation, Canerica, where the penalty for writing a bad cheque was death. In this country I could write a cheque for $100, have the money in my bank account, and could be reasonably certain that the money may not come out for years. Why? Because cheques would be as good as real money. Everyone would trust them.<p>At the same time, however, my money would be lent out. While my money is in the bank the banker can lend it out at interest. For the 2 or 3 year expected circulation time there is an additional $100 out there. I get interest on that $100 for a couple years, that isn't really mine. So in Canerica I (and to a lesser extent, my bank) am the net benefactor due to the inflation I've created.<p>That is basically what the banks have done, only they never need to cash their cheques. They can deposit them, lend them out again, collect more interest. But one day people are either going to get their deposits back or their debtors are not going to be able to pay their interest and it is all going to come crashing down. With a reserve ratio of 10:1, only 10% of their depositors need to claim for the bank to go bankrupt.",1233546393

That's 2500 hours at a rate of... $4.80 per hour[1]. When I could've made $15/hour right away at a boring office manager job doing estimates, phone support, and yelling at the men when they leave their tools a mess.

I don't know, whatever people who work hard and get promoted fast make within a couple years.<p>So when I start a new company that pays me more the next year, my first business ""closed"" - that means it's not going. You could say it ""failed"", but really, I learned the lessons, made a tiny bit of coin, and then promoted myself into the next business. I know lots of entrepreneurs who leapfrog themselves the same way - and similarly, lots of small companies get bought and integrated or stripmined by a bigger company.

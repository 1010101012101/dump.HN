Agreed, with an exception for when frequently used constructs are needlessly verbose or awkward. Something really minor, like the Python slicing notation, can make something <i>so convenient that you find new uses for it</i>. This is big. (For example, someStr[1:-1] means, ""drop the first and last char"".) It works the same for every ordered collection (lists, strings, tuples), so it's easy to remember. Dictionaries also support dictname[index] notation, but aren't ordered, so slicing is meaningless. (Lua seems to do something similar with its ""tables"".)<p>I'm not especially fond of the Lisp parenthesis, but I don't know of a better solution for a prefix-notation, nesting syntax. (Switching parenthesis for another paired symbol, e.g. curly braces, would just be a meaningless detail.) Postfix/stack languages can drop them, though.<p>Perl is sort of in-between; on the one hand, it is trying to build on the considerable power in the terse syntaxes like sed and awk, which are remarkable for quick scripts, but it is also trying to be usable for mid-to-large projects, which need to be relatively clean or they will become an unmaintainable mess. The latter is true for any language, of course, but it seems like good habits are harder to stick to in Perl.",1217268479

You kids today ain't never had it rough
Always had everything handed to you on a silver plate
You lazy brats think nothing's good enough<p>Well, nobody ever drove me to school when it was ninety degrees below
We had to walk buck naked through forty miles of snow
Worked in the coal mines twenty two hours a day for just half a cent
Had to sell my internal organs just to pay the rent<p>Let me tell you something, you whiny little snot
There's something wrong with all you kids today
You just don't appreciate all the things you've got
We were hungry, broken and miserable and we liked it fine that way<p>There were seventy three of us living in a cardboard box
All I got for Christmas was a lousy bag of rocks
Every night for dinner, we had a big 'ol chunk of dirt
If we were really good, we didn't get dessert<p>Didn't have no telephone, didn't have no FAX machine
All we had was a couple cans and a crummy piece of string
Didn't have no swimming pool when I was just a lad
Our neighbor's septic tank was the closest thing we had
Didn't have no dental floss, had to use old rusty nails
Didn't have Nintendo, we just poured salt on snails
Didn't have no water bed, had to sleep on broken glass
Didn't have no lawnmower, we used our teeth to cut the grass<p>What's the matter now, sonny, you say you don't believe this junk?
You think my story's wearin' kinda thin?
I tell you one thing, I never was such a disrespectful punk
Back in my time, we had a thing called discipline<p>My dad would whoop us every night till a quarter after twelve
Then he'd get too tired and he'd make us whoop ourselves
Then he'd chop me into pieces and play frisbee with my brain

3568142,comment,3566658,3567646,1,0,byrneseyeview,,,"I'm presenting two possibilities:<p>1. There's an efficient market, and CEO pay reflects the extra value they create. In other words, a $100 million CEO is worth $50 million more than a $50 million CEO, so your economic outcome is the same regardless of which one you hire--except that larger companies will extract more value out of a given level of managerial talent, since they can amortize it over more underlings/revenue/whatever.<p>or<p>2. CEO pay and company performance are totally random. But for that to be the case, you'd have to deny that there's any such thing as being able to identify and pay for a talented CEO. Maybe! But every time I've interacted with large company CEOs, I've noticed that they tend to be very bright, and they work extremely hard. People who are in the 10th percentile of public company CEOs--the kinds of people who bankrupt companies--still seem to be in about the 90th percentile of smarts and energy.<p>I don't know of another theory that could explain the data as presented. Either the process is random, or it selects for people with certain valuable skills. If the system tends to promote skilled people, you'd expect the companies they run to have a higher return. Unless, of course, they capture that value for themselves.",1328730764

Example: Ice Cream Sandwich is slowly becoming available.<p>The iPhone lives off in its little garden - I agree that ""you know your phone will be state of the art for foreseeable future."" Apple strives to maintain vertical integration, so their software moves slowly. It's lock-stepping with their hardware. Hardware innovation generally moves at a steady, predictable pace.<p>Why does it matter that Android's value is more closely tied to the software? That's Google's area of expertise. They've tried to make the hardware a commodity. If it doesn't end up fragmenting so badly consumers start leaving (and I don't think they will) -- then the hardware will not garner the big margins.

3568024,comment,3566528,3567460,22,0,cd34,,,"The IRS has fairly straightforward rules to what meals can be deducted. The simplest rule is that four people must be present and business must be discussed. There are exceptions. You can't just deduct lunch, you would have to be 'away from the office' and could only deduct reasonable expenses. You couldn't buy lunch every day at Mortons or Ruth's Chris and easily deduct it. You can't easily count your daily lunches as expenses.<p>Reimbursing for mileage becomes tenuous if you work from home. Since you can't count commuting and you have no office, the mileage from your home office to your sales appointment isn't deductible. There are people that work around this by getting a PO Box that they 'check' before they go to a client meeting. A stop at the PO Box or ATM to check their balance becomes a business task. They can't deduct the mileage from their home to the PO Box/ATM, but they can deduct the mileage from the PO Box to the appointment.<p>Expenses on a business are taken directly against profits - to a degree. If you use a laptop 100% for business, you can deduct that (up to the Section 179 deduction cap) before having to use a depreciation table - typically MACRS5 which is unusually harsh in the tech world. If I had a nickel for the amount of equipment that survived beyond the depreciation table, I'd probably have 30 cents. If you buy that with your personal cash, you are paying for it with post-tax money rather than pre-tax money.<p>Health Insurance becomes another tricky situation. If you pay for it with the company, it becomes a taxable benefit, but, if you have employees in Florida, offering it to myself as an executive perk means I need to offer it to all employees, and pay 50% of their insurance.<p>These are brief overviews and an accountant would be the person to ask about what you can deduct and what he's willing to defend if you get audited.<p>There isn't really that much in terms of accounting to run a business. You get a credit card that you use exclusively for business expenses, and a separate checking account. Income from ventures goes into the checking account, bills for the expenses are paid from that, you pay yourself a monthly stipend. Whether you do a Sole Proprietorship, LLC or S-Corp, your income flows through to your personal tax return. A C Corp is subject to corporate tax, then, when you pay yourself you are taxed again on that money. That is the double taxation that everyone talks about, and, in certain rare situations, can reduce your tax bill. You also need to make sure that the business meets certain criteria and doesn't get treated as a hobby. You can't have dozens of money losing years, taking tax breaks and deductions all the time without the IRS getting suspicious. You can however win that case if you can prove through recordkeeping that you were indeed trying to make a profit, long incubation time, professional bookkeeping/recordkeeping, etc.<p>As for which company structure you choose, talk with an accountant.<p>Now, there are reasons to have a company structure rather than just getting 1099s. Two words, well, a word and an acronym: Simple IRA (or a SEP IRA depending on the company's size). Have excess cash? Rather than mucking with the paltry Roth or Traditional IRA, the Simple IRA allows you to put a lot more cash into a retirement fund. Pretax money with a company match that isn't taxed until it is withdrawn when you reach retirement age. Until you get more than 100 employees, this is one of the huge benefits. I believe your 2011 contribution can be up to $11500 with the company kicking in a 3% match of your compensation, not your contribution (i.e. earn $60k/year, you toss $11.5k of your pre-tax income, and the company kicks in an $1800 contribution). There are exceptions depending on age, coverage under other plans, but, it's almost as good as the investment sheltering provided to teachers - though, with their pay scale, very few teachers can really take advantage of the opportunity.<p>There are always ways around it and it depends on how far you're willing to bend the rules, and, if you bend it far enough to get an audit, whether you're still willing to keep bending.<p>There was a dialog in 'The Firm' that sums up how things work fairly succinctly. Tom Cruise was pitching the Sonny their tax planning pitch and it went something like:<p>Mr. Tolar handed you a schedule that virtually guarantees you zero tax with zero risk. [...] You defer your tax in full, even though you have a bankable LP.<p>Deferred till when?<p>What do you care, whenever it is, it is still the best interest free loan you'll ever get.<p>I have met people that will push, bend, and break the law because the penalty when/if they get caught is less than the income they made by using that money to make money.<p>It isn't something I would do or advocate, but, make sure your accountant is willing to walk up the steps with you to the IRS courthouse if you decide to travel willingly up that path.<p>In short, get an accountant (probably after April 15) and raise your issues. Tax planning is a very good strategy to have under control.<p>Added: forgot the reference to the home office deduction.<p>If you have a home office, it needs to be a space dedicated 100% to the business. It needs to fit the 'archway rule' which means it needs a door or archway that makes it a separate room. It can't be a room that you travel through to get somewhere else, i.e. living room, etc. You can then deduct a percentage of your expenses, electric, water, gas, etc based on the ratio of the square footage of the home office to your entire home. Now, here's the fun part. When you sell the home, if your house appreciated, a percentage of that is considered capital appreciation for the business.",1328729241

One of the shows talked about the Tank and how it was developed to get people across the 'deadmans zone' in trench warfare and ended up becoming the backbone of mobile maneuver tactics.<p>So this thing demonstrates a vehicle that can navigate completely unimproved terrain carrying a useful load. In battlefields like Afghanistan there is a huge challenge getting troops resupplied (this is true in any war of course). Helicopters and other air drop means (the robotic parachutes are pretty cool) require that your troops break cover to recover their goods, these things could walk into camp where you are under cover drop off supplies.<p>So one tactician might air drop these things out of a plane at a safe altitude and have them land within a couple of miles of the targeted base. The vehicle starts up, and walks over to the base to drop off the supplies. It could conceivably walk back out and, using a helium balloon, send up a retrieval cable that would let a helicopter come and pull it out of there.<p>Thats a pretty cool capability. And in peace time if this thing could walk into a city ravaged by an earth quake and drop off supplies, that would be cool. Or carry a clean up device through a nuclear contaminated forest, etc etc. The key is 'unimproved terrain' and '400 lbs for 20 miles'.<p>[1] <a href=""http://military.discovery.com/convergence/weaponology/episode/episode.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://military.discovery.com/convergence/weaponology/episod...</a>",1328729204

Not worth the hassle.<p>Of course there could be caveats like he isn't working full time or you've already built the product or something to skew it that dramatically.<p>I think the problem here is you honestly.  If you're unhappy with the equity distribution and that's all that is on your mind instead of building a good team to bring your product to market and make it successful, you're doomed anyways. Option 1 is always on the table, option 2 won't happen or lead to a good ending if your partner feels cheated from the start (assuming he would even go for it) and option 3, you're the obstacle, can you get around yourself?

3567909,comment,3566763,3567521,1,0,YmMot,,,"You use the phrase ""outed"", which to me implies public exposure, so my post is based mostly on that premise. If that's not the case, please just clarify and ignore the applicable parts.<p>In theory that sounds nice, and to a certain extent there are some similar systems in place already...but I just don't see it working that well overall.<p>We already have a system like this for sex offenders, and it's got some serious issues. In such a system it would either be up to each site to have a public ""troll list"" or they would have to have some central repository. In the case of the former, anytime you look at a sites list you won't be able to tell which ones are just someone who made an offensive comment or two on a single site and ""repeat offenders"" who are on many sites lists. You'd have to collate the lists somehow and even then you'd have troubles of differentiating the various ""levels"", mistaken identity, etc. In the case of a central repository that's a whole 'nother can of worms.<p>Then there's the question of what constitutes an ""identity"" for the purposes of being able to post. A name? An address? Those don't seem suitable to me for such purposes, they're too fudge-able and temporary. A State ID# or SSN seem too personal and permanent. If the former are compromised, you can limit the damage somewhat, the latter less so. There's the issue of proliferation. Even if you use addresses, every single time you put your info out there is the increased risk of it being compromised. It's not unreasonable to want to limit the amount of times you expose yourself to the risk of security breaches.<p>There's the issue of the practical burden it would place on the sites. This isn't so much of an issue since it would be voluntary, but it's something to consider.<p>I think the ethical issue of whether it's ok to out someone who obviously has enemies on the internet is a tricky one. Again it gets to the issue of what constitutes an ""identity"" for these purposes. If it's too specific it becomes dangerous to release, or even store...and if it's not specific enough it becomes dangerous due to confusion, or loses it's sting.<p>There's also the question of whether it will really deter anyone. As much as they like to try and evoke the image of a deliberate prankster, I don't think most trolls really think things out <i>that</i> much. It strikes me as impulsive behavior. So they get hit on one site after an impulsive trolling and just move to another one.<p>Assuming that it's specific, I think the possibility of some sort of violent retaliation needs to be considered. You could argue one reaps what one sows, but I don't think that's an attitude that belongs in the consideration of organizing a society. We should value protecting <i>everyone</i> over punishing wrongdoers. A balance needs to be struck between removing the cause of harm from society and not discarding anyone.<p>Overall I wouldn't be surprised if such a system comes into being. Some walled gardens where members are authenticated based on a one way hash of some personally identifiable information, or a cryptographic key-fob or something...and if they cause a ruckus their access will be revoked. However I think such a system would have enough problems that it wouldn't take off except in isolated pockets that highly value having an exclusive discussion among a verified group, and there I think it would be more about that than preventing trolling.<p>For trolls, I think measures similar to what is mostly used now will continue to be the main defense. The ability to moderate, vote, etc.",1328727683

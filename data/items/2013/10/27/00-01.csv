6620243,comment,6619891,6619891,2,0,agibsonccc,,,"I think there&#x27;s something to be said for the general concept. Something to consider is risk vs reward though. If you&#x27;re comfortable doing sales and the technical part or maybe even harder good at delegation and have some financial resources, you might be able to pull this off. A job is pretty consistent though and frankly can be less demanding even if you are learning new skills or working with smart people.<p>That being said, I think collaborating on open source still can give you that part of work you might be missing. There are positives and negatives to both lifestyles. Some are better at certain parts of the field than others.<p>I personally had  a product take off, and and now backpacking in the valley for as long as I want. I&#x27;ve been able to meet one new customer a day (literally) for the past few weeks.<p>What they DON&#x27;T tell you is what it can take to get to that. It&#x27;s ok to talk about the idea of not selling time for money AS LONG as you don&#x27;t sensationalize it. Everyone has their preferences.",1382835558

6620239,comment,6619891,6620157,3,0,matthewmacleod,,,"> But it is clearly not the same thing phrased differently. The first is an accurate description of a wage labor relationship, the latter is an accurate description of the relation between members of a labor cooperative. You can imagine that the latter relationship is the case when you are in the former relationship, but self-delusion probably isn&#x27;t useful or healthy in the long term.<p>I disagree that this is self-delusion, and that&#x27;s a thoroughly unhelpful attitude - you are just choosing to emphasise a different set of facts, which does not invalidate the other.<p>There are absolutely loads of jobs out there for a talented developer at this point in time. You can essentially select any team you want, and name your price - the upshot is that this moves so much power away from employers that the relationship is pretty far away from wage slavery.",1382835528

Github code:\n<a href=""https://github.com/chrisvana/repobuild"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/chrisvana/repobuild</a><p>It&#x27;s cool because:<p>* It makes it really easy to integrate new open source code. Want to compile against boost? Add one line. Want an ML library? Add another.<p>* Everything gets automatically pulled in.<p>* It makes it really easy to share your open source code with others.<p>* Works with a bunch of languages.<p>* Proven model from companies like Google, Facebook, Twitter, etc.<p>My main project is using large scale computing (data from millions of CPU hours) to change how drug discovery is done. Drugs are very expensive because 98% of them fail. This hopefully changes that, and makes it profitable for companies to go after much smaller diseases that do not currently get attention.

6620237,comment,6618683,6619521,1,0,mezzopiano,,,"Thanks for stopping by and taking time to discuss this! (since you appear to be new to HN, please take the abounding hypercriticality with a grain of salt)<p>I personally think it&#x27;s great that you are innovating in the field of workplace ergonomics, and, since I&#x27;ve been trying to improve my own posture and general health (and I think the design looks cool, too), I&#x27;m looking to back your project.<p>I have three questions for you if you want to fully convince me of your invention:\n(1) How, from your scientific view, does the Freedman compare to a sitting ball or a standing desk? \n(2) From an engineering standpoint, the buttock pads (for lack of a better term) are going to take a lot of pressure over time. How did you keep them flexible (since they adjust flexibly to bodily asymmetries), while preventing them from wearing out?\n(3) Conceptually, you make the point that chairs are, quite literally, killing people (e.g. your argument above &quot;were we meant to farm or sit?&quot;, or in the video &quot;[what the press means by saying that sitting kills] is that in a normal sitting position, which is often slumped, you turn of an enzyme [...]. After an hour, you have 20% more bad cholesterol [...]. That leads to metabolic disorder.&quot;). How does your invention, itself a chair, though a completely rethought one, counteract this? The studies you cite (e.g. Edwardson et al., <a href=""http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0034916"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjourna...</a> ; Zderic & Hamilton, <a href=""http://jap.physiology.org/content/100/1/249.full"" rel=""nofollow"">http://jap.physiology.org/content/100/1/249.full</a> ), show that any kind of prolonged inactivity (in humans and rats, respectively) will lead to the adverse consequences you list. What are your thoughts on this?<p>Again, I entirely commend you for putting in the effort and expertise to develop this -- I think the result looks great, and you have my complete support. You certainly seem to have found a market eagerly searching for a solution to the lifestyle diseases of our times (which is a huge expectation, even you citations recommend a &quot;multidimensional&quot; approach, cf. Burton et al.). All the best!",1382835448

A couple of years ago when Watson destroyed the best human Jeopardy champions, I immediately saw its near-term applicability in sifting through the enormous space of medical data/research and correlating it with patient information to yield amazingly accurate and insightful diagnoses.<p>This isn&#x27;t after-the-singularity type science fiction where we&#x27;re adding assumption upon assumption to several levels beyond what is possible.<p>This is applying a technology (that&#x27;s already proven at performing similar complex deductive analysis over massive quantities of data) to a new discipline.  Any assumptions about what we can do in the new discipline with the current technology are minimal and extremely likely overcomable.<p>Even if Watson isn&#x27;t quite there, the way is pretty clear now.

A couple of the more irritating snippets:<p><i>In a regular 9-5 job youre selling your time to an employer</i><p>Or, to look at it another way, you are collaborating with a number of colleagues to develop and sell software, and you are all sharing the income. See how that&#x27;s the same thing, phrased differently? Attitude matters.<p><i>You can do whatever you want now. Everything is under your control. Its not dependent on your boss, co-workers, or other departments. You decide what projects to work on. You decide when you want to work on them. You even decide whether or not you want to get out of bed every day.</i><p>You&#x27;re not dependent on anything - except your customers or clients, your investors, your employees, third parties the list goes on. Sure, you could choose to stay in bed, or leave for a week and do no work - but you&#x27;d have to consider what the implications would be for your services, your family, staff and so on. Sometimes, the illusion of freedom is more dangerous.<p><i>You get to put all your time and effort into only things youre truly passionate about.</i><p>Nope - all of the grunt work still has to be done. Need a stupid feature for a large client? You&#x27;ll probably be doing it. And you&#x27;ll be doing all of that sysadmin stuff you hate too.<p><i>Selling your time for money to an employer will put a cap on the amount of money you can make... You are generating more money for their business than theyre paying you. Thats the only way they can run a profitable business. Which means youre getting screwed.</i><p>It&#x27;s a trade-off, isn&#x27;t it? I think we can all accept that the self-employed will keep more of the value they generate. But the other side of the coin is that they&#x27;re exposed to more risk. Not a bad trade-off, especially if you&#x27;ve got a family.<p><i>Most of the software you write at a company doesnt ever ship.</i><p>I can count on one hand the number of features I&#x27;ve ever developed which didn&#x27;t ship, and quickly. Maybe if you work at a dysfunctional company, this could be the case.<p>tl;dr: don&#x27;t take a job at a rubbish company you&#x27;re not interested in. Enjoy what you do - have you seen what the market is like for &quot;developer time&quot; recently? You can have your pick of companies, developing software for almost any imaginable market, and earn an impressive salary doing it.<p>Okay, maybe this works for you - and that&#x27;s great, I&#x27;m all behind people finding work that suits their lifestyles. But I&#x27;ve got an awesome 95 job, where I am paid very well to work with great people on interesting products.

My current method of searching on google to grab the bulbapedia article then scrolling through to find type information (which isn&#x27;t always there for brand new pokemon) was far too slow. I&#x27;ll probably keep this running on my iPhone simulator when I play X/Y.<p>Personally I would have preferred this in website form, but that&#x27;s only because I&#x27;m always in front of a laptop.<p>Things that would improve the app:<p>1. A status bar on the main listing. I like having the status bar there if possible to see battery and time and such, but more importantly it would allow the tap to scroll to the top shortcut.<p>2. Slight bug on the detail-page: you can select a type (e.g. &#x27;bug&#x27;) but it doesn&#x27;t go anywhere.<p>3. Color labels on the types, like most pokemon websites have. Right now I find it a little hard to scan the type listings because it&#x27;s all text.<p>4. Maybe make the details page title the name of the pokemon? I think that would make it alot more obvious what I&#x27;m looking at (not a concern when you&#x27;re coming from the search page, but when you&#x27;ve left the app on the details page it&#x27;s a bit disorienting).<p>5. This is a much bigger feature request, but seeing type weaknesses would be great, too.

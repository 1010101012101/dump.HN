Having mathematical formalism and a rigorously studied methods makes me feel OK about doing it though, otherwise I would be very uncomfortable with the approach :)<p>I love Bayesian statistics from a conceptual point of view, but the ease with which one ventures into the land of analytic intractability kind of puts me off more complex models.

These days, not a day goes by on the Rust team in which we don't discuss ways to simplify the language.<p>My colleague Dave Herman always says that language design goes through cycles: You identify a problem, add solutions to fix it, then discover that these solutions are best merged with some other ideas. The result is that, as a language evolves, complexity goes up and down. I think that we're coming off a peak of complexity and the language is going to evolve toward simplicity in the near term.<p>Just to name a few simple examples, removing the alias analysis pass and removing ""native modules"" are some simplifications that mostly have consensus at this point.",1333468677

3793431,comment,3791545,3792771,2,0,rprospero,,,"I guess I'm a bit confused about how you're using casual to describe gaming.  I'd argue that King Quest were some of the least casual games in history.  I'm a lousy FPS player, but none of the Modern Warfare games would require a tenth the time I spent trying to get past the Yeti in Kings Quest V.<p>The old Sierra games required constant focus and diligent note taking that I would have thought would rule them out from being casual.  You'd never get anywhere with these games just spending ten minutes a day playing on the train.  It can work for Monkey Island, since you can keep slamming things together until you win, but the Sierra games punish anything short of building a complete mental map of the game universe.<p>EDIT:  I suddenly became afraid that this post came off as snarky or sarcastic.  I didn't intend for it to be.  Honestly, I'm just getting old and recognizing that the definition of casual changed while I wasn't looking.  I really do want to know what it now means for a game to be casual.",1333468451

It's invasive and uncomfortable, and probably not a place I'd feel welcome as an employee.<p>What it mostly reinforces to me, however, is just how terribly ignorant and wishful laws like that are. If I build a business and bottom out my bank account, kill myself with 100-hour weeks, and build my very life around making the company work, you better believe I have the right to know if the person I'm hiring plans to take off for 6 months right after being hired. And you better believe that weighs against them in the hiring process. I didn't set up the business as a facet of family planning services: I want to hire someone who's willing to work hard to build my business in exchange for pay. If a person knows they're going to take 6 months off immediately, then it's not time to apply for a job, because you're not going to be working; apply for something when you're ready to actually do it.<p>It continually amazes me how government largesse and layers of indirection break people's natural intuitions and allow them to condone forcing a third party to pay for their own life choices, in a vain attempt to mitigate the unfortunate trade-offs that accompany our constrained mortal existence.<p>Transparency is not a bad thing. There are people out there who want a solid job that pays well and fulfills their ambition while making good money; and there are employers willing to offer those things in exchange for solid performance, a reasonable salary, and reliability.

The only gripe I have is that often times the models make simplifying assumptions which hold tenuously at best.  One example of this is the Gaussian copula used in VAR.  In actuality, neither the marginals nor the copula are Gaussian in the large majority of cases; they ARE stable distributions, but the tails can be absolutely HUGE.  The Gaussian distribution is attractive because it is well behaved, and in most cases we don't have enough observations to properly understand the full tail structure of the underlying distribution.  As a result, you get quants that make a model and call a small subset of points (which are completely valid) ""outliers"".  Then when we observe the tails of the distribution, things fall apart because over-leveraged bankers made decisions based on the notion that the model accurately reflected reality.",1333468177

There are only primitive types and reference types (i.e., objects).<p>This does create some overhead.  It means that for any instance of a user-defined type you have to use additional resources in two ways which may be unnecessary:  First, it goes on the heap, so it invariably adds to the garbage collector's workload.  Second, it's always going to be internally referenced indirectly via a pointer.  That's an extra 4-8 bytes that could be significant overhead for a sufficiently small type - say, a struct that represents an RGBA value as four separate bytes.  That's also poorer locality of reference, in a way that I suspect could bite when you're dealing with large collections of small elements.",1333467778

You can disable optimization if you just care about fast turnaround times, but you're always at the mercy of LLVM to do the actual code generation. To that end, the Rust devs have recently begun an initiative to profile the amount of LLVM IR that they generate in the compiler, and they've made some good strides so far just from picking the low-hanging fruit.<p>As far as comparisons to other languages go, I'm not sure if Rust's compilation model is set up to be as fast as Go's, although (IIRC) Rust avoids the template-generation step that bogs down C++.",1333467372

3793312,comment,3792627,3793246,4,0,jules,,,"Well, it depends on how you look at it. The Bayesian MAP approach is basically the same as the frequentist approach with made up data. Instead of using the maximum likelihood estimator p = pos/(pos+neg) you pretend that each new post already has some up/down votes by default, and then you use simply p = pos/(pos+neg). Seems like an even more intuitive explanation of the Bayesian knob to me! Rather than an abstract ""alpha"" to a ""Dirichlet prior"", you get something concrete (the number of made up votes). And you get a simple formula, which some would find desirable.<p>But I agree that the Bayesian approach is conceptually much cleaner. IMO the frequentist approach is just computational corner cutting for when the math in the Bayesian approach gets too involved, which is sometimes useful. What's nice about the Bayesian approach is that you state your assumptions and then it's just turning the math machinery. In contrast, in the frequentist approach the assumptions are interwoven and hidden in arbitrary choices in how the math is done (And then they claim that Bayesians are subjective! It's just that Bayesians <i>admit</i> that they are subjective. Frequentists try to hide the fact that they are <i>more</i> subjective in the math). The not so nice thing is that turning the math machinery is not always so easy and does not always produce fast algorithms. That's where maximum likelihood and friends come in, but I'd view them as an approximation to Bayesian methods.",1333467029

3793266,comment,3792366,3792751,4,0,DougWebb,,,"One drawback to JSON files, and XML files and a number of other text file formats as well, is that they allow variable formatting. That makes them difficult to work with using tools like diff, which takes away a lot of the power of version control.<p>For example, you can take a JSON file and format it two ways: all on one line with little or no whitespace, and pretty-printed with multiple lines and indenting. Semantically, the two files are identical because they'll be parsed into the same data structure when you read it in. Textually they're completely different, which becomes a problem when two people with two different editors that use the two different formats when writing the file try to work on it. If person A commits the file pretty-printed, and person B makes a small change then commits it minimized, how does person A determine what's changed? It's a hassle.<p>XML suffers from this as well, and can be even worse. In some XML DTDs/schemas elements can be reordered without changing the semantic meaning of the document.<p>I've also had this problem with CSS files, which are partially order-dependent. If you have a big CSS file with lots of rules that cover different parts of your site, there are clumps of rules that are related and must be in the right order to cascase properly, but the clumps are mostly independent and their order doesn't matter.<p>In the past I've written tools that canonicallize formats like these just for doing diffs. It's a hassle, but it was necessary to allow my team to manage changes in shared resource files, and it worked well. Today, I'd use a tool like that as a git commit hook so that the repository always contained the format I wanted (assuming it's still usable in that format, which wasn't always the case) but back then I didn't have that option.",1333466556

They're PL experts (watching them at work is quite intimidating, actually, as someone who doesn't have a PhD in CS), but they absolutely reject the allure of the ivory tower. Note the header on the page linked in this submission:<p>""a safe, concurrent, practical language""<p>Note ""practical"". I've witnessed several exchanges on the mailing list where the developers attempt to excise language features. For example, in Rust, `if` is an expression rather than a statement, and thus is redundant with the `?:` ternary conditional expression syntax familiar to C-like languages (the latter was removed). Alternatively, they often acknowledge that having three types of pointers is suboptimal from a simplicity perspective, but they consistently conclude that the semantics unique to each type of pointer are valuable enough to justify the mental cost.",1333466269

Not sure how scipy does it.<p>Anyway, I personally think 95% confidence intervals are a crutch.  The <i>correct</i> Bayesian approach is to consider two items, each with their own up and down votes, and integrate over all possible values for p1 and p2 (being the underlying probabilities of upvotes for item 1 and 2, respectively) over the observed data, and compute the likelihood of superiority of p1 over p2.<p>How to turn that into an actual ranking function?  No idea.  I doubt it would work, but you could compute against a benchmark distribution (i.e. the uniform 0-1 distribution).<p>If you do that, it probably turns out that your ranking function is the mean of the Beta distribution, which is simple: (U+1)/(U+D+2) where U and D are the upvote/downvote counts [note: we started with the prior assumption that p could be anywhere between 0 and 1, uniformly].  Basically, the counts shrink towards 1/2 by 1.

The simplest approach is to just use a non uniform prior.  His pessimistic bound could be emulated by having an initial alpha that places more weight on low star ratings.  The intuitive interpretation of that being ""things are probably bad unless proven good"" roughly.  Another option would be to generate the prior based on the posterior distributions of other items.  Just take the distribution of ratings observations for all products of a given type (perhaps only items produced by that company?) to get a sensible prior on a new item in that category.<p>The strength of priors here is that it is very easy to take intuitions and encode them statistically, in an understandable way.

The author would argue an item with only two reviews that are both fives should have a lower star value than an item with 400 fives and 1 four.  We typically associate stars with the averaging algorithm (i.e. we define an item's star value as the average of the star values of its reviews), so it might help if we do away with the notion that each <i>item</i> has a star value, and just think of this as saying an item with 400 reviews of 5 stars and 1 review of 4 stars should be shown before an item that just has 2 reviews of 5 stars.<p>Currently, when we see an item's star value, we think of it as an indicator of the quality of the item.

Forget ""Web 3.0"" ""Web 3.D"" is way more exciting.",1225554877
350755,comment,350603,350627,0,0,whacked_new,,,"I suspect it isn't actually burnout, but a shift in culture. Namely, the attitude towards work and what it means in one's life. The culture change is quite unthinkably fast though. First you have freeter, then neet, then hodo-hodo-zoku. Continuing this trend, expect a new term in another few years.",1225554859

Winning two and three upset matches, feeling suddenly so loved, so many talking to you as if there is love. But always the same, then. For then you awaken to the fact that you are loved for winning only. The two and three wins created you, for people. It is not that the wins made them recognize something that existed unrecognized before these upset wins. The from-noplace winning <i>created</i> you. You must keep winning to keep the existence of love and endorsements and the shiny magazines wanting your profile.'<p>Best 1079-page book ever.",1225553272

350745,comment,350732,350733,0,0,robg,,,"I agree. It's just these election thingies are very good markers for where we're at because of how they dominate coverage. Still amazing that the internet got mentioned as a first or second choice by only one in three people. That's a tripling on 2004 but there's still a long way to go. Even among 18-29 year olds only 50% cite the internet as a primary source.<p>Also these numbers show how much newspapers really are dying among the young. Only 17% of the 18-29 demographic cited them first or second.",1225552578

These generally drop off over the weekend, so it is only natural that HN traffic does as well. I imagine that there are significantly fewer of us using this site over the weekend, but there is also less for us to talk about.",1225552022

At least in the beginning. I'm learning here. My blog (right now, at least) is more about thinking things through. For myself. And learning. From comments like this!",1225551613

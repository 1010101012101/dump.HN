It's really a terrific ""keyboard"" and seems to perform as well as Swype, if not better.<p>It worked so well for $4.99 that I purchased Dragon Home for $50.<p>And Dragon Home seems to be everything I expected: it needs training to understand me, I need training to understand how to work it.

It is very Windows specific, and out of the box and in their examples, it understands Outlook and Excel, but does not seem to understand GMail, and why should it, GMail is only seven years old.<p>I guess I should have dictated this, but sadly, I typed it in.<p>It's good that it will be made available to all Apple users.

2856362,comment,2855129,2855129,3,0,palish,,,"I write all my C and C++ code at warning level 4 (the maximum, which is probably equivalent to -Wall).  IMO, it was a mistake for Visual Studio to default to warning level 3.  Ignoring the compiler in production code is a sign of laziness, or that you don't take what you're doing seriously.<p>Warnings should be disabled on a per-source-file basis.  And since you <i>actively choose to ignore</i> specific warnings, you still benefit from the compiler's other sanity checks.<p>In Visual Studio, this is accomplished by<p><pre><code>  #pragma warning( disable: 4100 )\n</code></pre>\nat the top of a .c or .cpp file.  This will ignore ""unreferenced parameter"" warnings.  (Personally, I don't ignore those either.  It's saved me on more than one occasion, and once is enough for me.  So instead, I use a macro UNREF_PARAM(param) to suppress the warning in specific cases.)<p>A header file sometimes generates a warning that you want to choose to ignore.  But if we disabled it in the header file, then that disable would propagate to all other code which included the header file -- a big mistake!<p>Visual Studio solves this by:<p><pre><code>  #pragma warning( push )\n  #pragma warning( disable: 4100 )\n  //----------------------------------------------------\n  // foo.h\n  //   The Foo module serves as an example of how to\n  // properly suppress the ""unreferenced parameter""\n  // warning within a header file, via Visual Studio's\n  // #pragma warning( push ) and pop mechanism.\n  //----------------------------------------------------\n  /*\n    .... code which generates the warning ....\n  */\n  #pragma warning( pop )\n</code></pre>\nThis allows you to ""scope"" the disable to a single header file.<p>(Lastly, it's worth noting that SQLite outputs hundreds of warnings --- but they are neither lazy nor irresponsible, because they have hundreds of unit tests to verify that SQLite works correctly at runtime, as defined by the tests, across all platforms.)",1312713292

In order to report a profit, they use unconventional methods of accounting that imply costs of their own customer acquisition are irrelevant to their profitability. It's not esoteric or one-off costs they're eliminating from their ""profit"" figure.<p>Given that Groupon have attracted attention more for their claims of profitability than any particular novelty or technical superiority it's more than a little concerning that using conventional accounting methods they're making a <i>loss</i>, and it's ongoing marketing expenses rather than one-off acquisitions and compensation schemes that are to blame.",1312713224

2856358,comment,2856042,2856042,3,0,Mz,,,"<i>But Hasegawa and other historians have shown that Japan’s leaders were in fact quite savvy, well aware of their difficult position, and holding out for strategic reasons. Their concern was not so much whether to end the conflict, but how to end it while holding onto territory, avoiding war crimes trials, and preserving the imperial system. The Japanese could still inflict heavy casualties on any invader, and they hoped to convince the Soviet Union, still neutral in the Asian theater, to mediate a settlement with the Americans. Stalin, they calculated, might negotiate more favorable terms in exchange for territory in Asia. It was a long shot, but it made strategic sense.</i><p>This piece sounds very plausible to me and helps make this new theory sound fairly solid as far as the ultimate conclusion that Russia's declaration of war was the final straw. The article really doesn't convince me that the nuclear bombs played no role.  It indicates that after the first one was dropped, Japan sent a message to their ambassador in Moscow asking him to press for a reply from the Russians. The article says:  <i>The bombing added a “sense of urgency,” Hasegawa says, but the plan remained the same.</i> So there was concern, there was a reaction, but apparently not what we have been historically taught that the bombs simply caused the Japanese to cave in horror and surrender unconditionally.  No, they opted to surrender to the US in preference to a Russian invasion as the lesser evil.  It sounds like a savvy decision making process when faced with sucky options.",1312713074

2856353,comment,2851470,2851797,1,0,Vitaly,,,"The efficiency of our production is rising for centuries indeed. Once, a peon on a field could hardly produce for his own family, a modern day farmer can supply food for thousands of people.<p>Same can be seen in almost all industries.<p>For centuries this trend was offset with appearance of new kinds of production. New fields opened new markets and new places for work.<p>Lets ignore the current situation and ponder where does it lead us. It is inevitable that in the future most of day-to-day stuff we use will be produced by robots with minimal up to none human oversight.<p>There is only that much that we can consume. There is only that much of <i>different</i> kinds of produciton we can require. And we can not all be working in a creative capacity, inventing new stuff and inventing new markets. Inavitably a day will come when it will be technologically possible to supply all day-to-day the needs of world's population with stuff and services supplied mostly by robots.<p>What will happen then?<p>From several hundreds years ago, when people produced mostly for themselves, to the distant future when we all be serviced by robots and efficient production chains we see a definite trend. Somewhere along the path there should be disruptive events for this to happen, when a 'tension' produced by efficiency leads to massive losses of jobs.<p>For most of the time during the whole history the argument ""it is not different then the previous time it happen"" will be valid, but there will be definitely times it wont be the case. And it is possible that now is one of those times. Rise in effeciency must lead to loss of jobs <i>eventurally</i>. May be the time is now.<p>Oh, and this future is not necesserily a very dark one. After all, having most stuff produced effectively only means that most of the population will not <i>have</i> to work. Mey be it will lead to large portion of the population being a ""dead weight"", burning their life in leasure, and small energetic minority engaging in moving us forward, I don't know. May be it will lead to a large production 'surplus' that we will use to colonize the solar system and beyond? May be something else...<p>But I think we need to start thinking of what the society will look like when most people will not <i>have</i> to work to lead a decent life? What incentives will we need to invent to still have enough people to move forward? How to prevent degradation? I don't think artificial limits on automation and technology is the answer, but we might eventually come to this. I can see a politician introducing a SaveTheJobsBill to outlaw massively automated factories. We need to start thinking about it now, before it actually happens.",1312712846

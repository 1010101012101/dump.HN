1799,comment,1758,1797,0,0,palish,,,"Yeah, it can be crippling.<p>But once, I went a whole week sleeping 3 hours a day.  I'd spend from 11-7 at work, then 8 PM - 7 AM on my startup, sleep 'til 10, repeat.  I loaded up on NoDoz.  After that week, I got a horrible cold, and was knocked out for the week after that (though I still went to work), but in the meantime I got a large number of features done.<p>My point is, if you have the drive and commitment, you will *find time*, even if your situation is biased against finding time.<p>Shawn",1172803515

In that scenario it doesn't really hurt to spend the first few hours ""getting in the zone"" or ""wasting time"". If you only have a 3 hour slot then a couple non-productive hours can be crippling.",1172802989
1796,comment,1741,1741,0,0,whatsreal,,,"Excellent story, though I must admit I have read it before.  I always wonder will history judge us the same way we judge them?  Will the entrepreneurial spirit that is pervasive in hacker circles today be a positive or negative blip in the history of technology, economy, etc?
I certainly believe that it is for the better.  Though not all startups may end well, the advances in ideas, and the experience gained by the individuals involved as well as the spectating world, should prove to be a positive note in our history.
And now back to work ;)",1172802855

I have learned so much more about entrepreneurship, history, news, world status, and everything else than my classes could possibly teach me.  I am just glad all this training to be a sheep will be over soon.",1172801911

I then said, ""Okay, I will go out on foot and pitch 10 teachers per month to use my service, resulting in $100 / month increase in revenue.""  In the spreadsheet, you'll be able to predict your total cost per month, and the month that revenue exceeds debt, the total cost is how much money you need to start your startup.  But one last thing: Whatever your debt is, double it per month.  Whatever you predict your revenue will be, cut that in half.  I came to a total of $15k, because I have small debts since I'm 19.  But it really puts into perspective just how little it costs to start a startup.<p>By the way, what's your startup?<p>Shawn",1172801177

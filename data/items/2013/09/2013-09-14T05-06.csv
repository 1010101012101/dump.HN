I.e., Linux does not add the the RDRAND output to the entropy pool.<p>This means it might take more time to generate the required number of random bits. So not trusting RDRAND means a process might block waiting for random data.<p>Then again, hardware generators may be affected by external forces - other than the NSA.

Odd, it sure seemed legit.<p>I know what you mean, you are talking about the &#x27;soapX cleans brighter!&quot; which of course is a contentless sentence intended to deceive, and I am with you there. But I think what is awesome about things like Adwords is it gives the small local business the ability to reach the people that are looking for them. Instead of dealing with some horrible chain I ended up at a tiny mom-and-pop shop, found out they had other services I&#x27;ve been looking for unsuccessfully, and now they have a guaranteed customer in me. I think that is great for me, and great for them, because they only paid a tiny amount for my click, and got a customer from it.<p>It&#x27;s not perfect; I&#x27;ve just done several searches just to see what will turn up, things like &#x27;kayak rental half moon bay&#x27; and such, and am not getting very good ad results.

But when you wake up, your eyes are open and you cannot move. You see things that your mind logically knows cannot actually be there, but they are real for you. The REM dream state continues, overlapping reality.<p>In one case I woke up one my side to a large, dimly lit figure on the side of the bed, staring at me with red eyes. It just stared at me, while I physically felt something at the bottom of the bed dragging my body off. I couldn&#x27;t move or even shift my head.<p>I was aware that I was awake, that this wasn&#x27;t a dream anymore, but that this sort of paranormal situation should&#x27;t be happening. I couldn&#x27;t move, couldn&#x27;t struggle - then the thing staring at me unhinged its jaws wider than should be humanly possible and screamed at me at the top of its lungs. It sounded like a human mixed with the shrill cry of a velociraptor from Jurassic Park.<p>I just remember trying to yell but not making noise, and feeling like I was drowning. I knew I was awake but the supernatural sense of <i>wrongness</i> was almost more terrifying than the hallucination.<p>Then, after what felt like minutes of struggling to breath, and the figure almost eating me, it all vanished, and I shook my body so violently I threw myself off the bed (seriously). I think I actually ran to the lights, turned them on and sat shuddering on my bed in the blanket for a while.<p>It&#x27;s no joke. I used to regularly have these, and I sympathize with anyone who has had them. They&#x27;re primarily caused by stress and anxiety (and have a high incidence in people with PTSD). It&#x27;s not like a nightmare where you can convince yourself it wasn&#x27;t real, because the things I hallucinated were as real to me as the lamp and nightstand.<p>Obviously I should say I didn&#x27;t consume anything the night before. It&#x27;s almost debilitating, and caused me insomnia for quite a while.<p>It was hard to describe to people - they are not the same things as night terrors. I would talk to people about it and they would say it was a bad nightmare. But it felt so real, it was like that scene from the Matrix with Neo and the bug.<p>Afterwards, details were always fully lucid and clear, and never became fuzzy. I eventually realized that the level of obsession I would get into when trying to get people to understand that it wasn&#x27;t <i>just</i> a nightmare mirrored the hysterical reactions you would see from characters in Nightmare on Elm Street or the Exorcist. I never really believed in things like alien abduction, but I can fully understand why repeated exposure to sleep paralysis would cause someone to seriously question reality.",1379138065

Without it you not only get a torrent of pointless, trivial content that readers have to sift through to find the real stuff, but you also lose <i>the</i> critical factor that makes the editorial challenge of Wikipedia tractable; without notability, you simply have too many potential articles to fact-check, and no way to fact-check them.<p>About 15 years ago some friends and I started a company whose technical premise boiled down to taking IRC and replacing the static tree-based &quot;routing&quot; system it has with a real dynamic routing protocol. No more netsplits! Arbitrary topologies! It was so simple! Why would anyone want anything other than a biconnected IRC? It turns out that the moment you lose the static tree property, the whole system goes to hell. All the sudden, messages aren&#x27;t (and can&#x27;t be) reliable, because the network can change out from under them while they&#x27;re being forwarded. So you figure you&#x27;ll just build a simple reliability scheme for messages to ride on. Oh, wait: IRC is a group messaging system, and not only is the distributed systems GMS problem not particularly easy to build in a &quot;realistic&quot; network, but providing reliability on it is essentially the multicast reliability problem, which is itself so annoying that it&#x27;s part of why IP multicast failed.<p>My long-winded point is, sometimes something that seems like an obvious weakness of an existing system is actually fundamental to that system&#x27;s viability.",1379137282

6384781,comment,6378228,6384744,1,0,sillysaurus2,,,"I&#x27;m trying to figure out how my understanding of the paper went so horribly awry, but I&#x27;m just not seeing it.  From the paper:<p><i>The first family of attacks, termed synchronous attacks, is applicable in scenarios where the plaintext or ciphertext is known and the attacker can operate synchronously with the encryption on the same processor, by using (or eavesdropping upon) some interface that triggers encryption under an unknown key. For example, a Virtual Private Network may allow an unprivileged user to send data packets through a secure channel. This lets the user trigger encryption of plaintexts that are mostly known (up to some uncertainties in the packet headers), and our attack would thus, under some circumstances, enable any such user to discover the key used by the VPN to protect all users packets. As another example, consider the Linux dm-crypt and cryptoloop services.  These allow the administrator to create a virtual device which provides encrypted storage into an underlying physical device, and typically a normal filesystem is mounted on top of the virtual device. If a user has write permissions to any file on that filesystem, he can use it to trigger encryptions of known plaintext, and using our attack he is subsequently able to discover the encryption key used for the underlying device. We have experimentally demonstrated the latter attack, and showed it to reliably extract the full AES key using about 65ms of measurements (involving just 800 write operations) followed by 3 seconds of analysis.</i><p>Questions:<p>1) In that example, the attacker &quot;discovered the key used by the VPN to protect all users&#x27; packets.&quot;  Does that mean the VPN reused the same AES key for each encryption?<p>2) If so, then if the VPN were to change the encryption key each time it encrypted a packet, wouldn&#x27;t that protect against this attack?  The attacker had to be able to trigger 800 encryptions that all used the same encryption key, right?  Or does &quot;write operation&quot; refer to something other than &quot;the attacker triggered an encryption of some known plaintext&quot;?",1379137082

6384760,comment,6379732,6380037,4,0,Pitarou,,,"It takes advantage of JS&#x27;s complicated type coercion semantics and the overloading of the [] and + operators.<p>We start with [] and [[]].<p>convert [] to a boolean with !:<p><pre><code>    ![] --> false
    !![] --> true
</code></pre>
convert [] to undefined by subscripting it:<p><pre><code>    [][[]] --> undefined
</code></pre>
convert [] [[]] and true to numbers by prefixing them with + and adding them with +:<p><pre><code>    +[]   --> 0
    +[[]] --> NaN
    +!![] --> +true --> 1
    +!![]+(+!![]) --> +true+(+true) --> 1+(1) --> 2
    etc.
</code></pre>
convert any of these to strings by prefixing them with []+<p><pre><code>    []+[]     --> &quot;&quot;
    []+![]    --> []+false     --> &quot;false&quot;
    []+[][[]] --> []+undefined --> &quot;undefined&quot;
    []+(+[])  --> []+0 --> &quot;0&quot;
</code></pre>
get individual characters with the array subscript operator:<p><pre><code>    ([]+![])[+[]] --> ([]+false)[0] --> &quot;false&quot;[0] --> &quot;f&quot;
    ([]+!![])[+!![]+(+!![])+(+!![])] --> ([]+true)[1+(1)+(1)] --> &quot;true&quot;[3] --> &quot;e&quot;
    etc...
</code></pre>
So now we can obtain a limited number of characters:<p><pre><code>    &quot;a&quot; &quot;d&quot; &quot;e&quot; &quot;f&quot; &quot;i&quot; &quot;l&quot; &quot;n&quot; &quot;r&quot; &quot;s&quot; &quot;t&quot; &quot;u&quot; &quot;N&quot; &quot;0&quot; &quot;1&quot; &quot;2&quot; &quot;3&quot; &quot;4&quot; &quot;5&quot; &quot;6&quot; &quot;7&quot; &quot;8&quot; &quot;9&quot;
</code></pre>
which we can combine into strings with the + operator:<p><pre><code>    &quot;f&quot;+&quot;i&quot;+&quot;l&quot;+&quot;t&quot;+&quot;e&quot;+&quot;r&quot; --> &quot;filter&quot;
    &quot;1&quot;+&quot;e&quot;+&quot;1&quot;+&quot;0&quot;+&quot;0&quot;+&quot;0&quot; --> &quot;1e1000&quot;
</code></pre>
It&#x27;s not much, but it&#x27;s enough to obtain large numbers:<p><pre><code>    +(&quot;1&quot;+&quot;2&quot;+&quot;3&quot;+&quot;4&quot;) --> +(&quot;1234&quot;) --> 1234
    +(&quot;1&quot;+&quot;e&quot;+&quot;1&quot;+&quot;0&quot;+&quot;0&quot;+&quot;0&quot;) --> +(&quot;1e1000&quot;) --> Infinity
</code></pre>
and, most importantly, to access a property of the array object:<p><pre><code>    [][&quot;filter&quot;]  --> function filter() { [native code] }
</code></pre>
and by converting these back to a string:<p><pre><code>    []+[][&quot;filter&quot;] --> &quot;function filter() { [native code] }&quot;
    []+Infinity     --> &quot;Infinity&quot;
</code></pre>
we can expand our alphabet still further, and access some even more exciting properties:<p><pre><code>    [][&quot;constructor&quot;]           --> function Array() { [native code] }
    ([]+[])[&quot;constructor&quot;]      --> function String() { [native code] }
    (![])[&quot;constructor&quot;]        --> function Boolean() { [native code] }
    (+[])[&quot;constructor&quot;]        --> function Number() { [native code] }
    [][&quot;filter&quot;][&quot;constructor&quot;] --> function Function() { [native code] }
</code></pre>
Almost there now.<p>By converting these back to strings we can access even more characters, and by passing the strings to the Function() constructor we can can construct functions and evaluate them!  In other words, we have &quot;eval&quot;.  Let&#x27;s use it to access the window object:<p><pre><code>    [][&quot;filter&quot;][&quot;constructor&quot;](&quot;return this&quot;) --> function anonymous() {return this}
    [][&quot;filter&quot;][&quot;constructor&quot;](&quot;return this&quot;)() --> window
</code></pre>
So now we have access to the global context and eval.  We don&#x27;t quite have access to the full range of letters, but we have enough letters to call toString, and use it&#x27;s base conversion ability to get the full lowercase alphabet:<p><pre><code>    10[&quot;toString&quot;](36) --> &quot;a&quot;
    11[&quot;toString&quot;](36) --> &quot;b&quot;
    ...
    25[&quot;toString&quot;](36) --> &quot;p&quot;
    ...
    35[&quot;toString&quot;](36) --> &quot;z&quot;
</code></pre>
And now we have &quot;p&quot;, we can use escape and unescape to get most of the rest:<p><pre><code>    unescape(escape(&quot; &quot;)[0]+4+0) --> &quot;@&quot;
</code></pre>
So there you have it!<p>The source code essentially runs this process backwards: it repeatedly uses regular expressions to convert the code back into &quot;()[]!+&quot; one step at a time.",1379136435

If you have ever built a UI heavy app, you would know how important it is to have the separation between html, css and js. It&#x27;s not just about putting them in different files, it&#x27;s about the context. It&#x27;s separation of duties.",1379135586

It&#x27;s it bit scary, but mostly annoying. If I&#x27;m sleeping I want to be sleeping, if I&#x27;m awake I want to be awake. Being somewhere in the middle isn&#x27;t fun.<p>For me it&#x27;s like a dream where I can see what I would be seeing if I were awake and I can make the decision to try to wake myself up, but moving is really difficult. In fact, I&#x27;m not sure that I&#x27;m actually moving myself at all or if I&#x27;m just dreaming that I am. So, I have to try to move my arms and shoulders, first very slowly and then I pick up momentum until I finally wake up. It&#x27;s as if I&#x27;m trying to learn how to move again.<p>I never feel like there are demons in the room, but I do get a feeling of paranoia that someone could be messing with me and I couldn&#x27;t do anything. Not really a rational thought since people could have been messing with me while I was totally asleep anyways.",1379135055

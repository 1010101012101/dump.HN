To ignore them is to marginalize them, to disagree with them is to threaten them, and to oppose them is assault. It&#x27;s incredibly hypocritical and self-centered behavior, especially for an adult.<p>And what I fear is that they&#x27;ll shape whatever environments that will allow it because everyone else has kowtowed to their feelings, and if you don&#x27;t let them have their way, you&#x27;ll become the toxic old guard who enables the victimizers-- quite a step away from &quot;big, fat meanie head&quot;.<p>In a business environment, after making their way into a managerial role, it may mean over-promoting people who agree with them and reassigning those who don&#x27;t. It might be some form of constant ostracism, like not getting invited along with everyone else to drinks after work, having negative rumors circulated about what a secret creep you are (&quot;I heard they tried to pick up someone who was drunk.&quot; &quot;I&#x27;d believe it, they don&#x27;t think rape is real.&quot; &quot;What a shitlord.&quot;, or not being put on jobs you&#x27;re best at. And if you aren&#x27;t having work that could make you look better withheld, you might have your career slowly poisoned by having things put in your file that indicate you&#x27;re not a good candidate for promotion, which is all for the best, since you could be a closet oppressor who undoes a lifetime of progressive equality.<p>That&#x27;s a bit hyperbolic, but those are all things that I&#x27;ve witnessed individually in varying degrees over the years, with different labels. It can be incredibly difficult to hold people to task for their actions, especially if they&#x27;re not forthright in what they&#x27;re doing and you&#x27;re in the minority.<p>Perhaps it help to solve this problem if we included one more warning about life early on: &quot;Safety is not guaranteed.&quot;",1427043304

Mentors are usually well-connected people that can remove roadblocks and help in more ways than simple mentoring. The valley is incestuous and it&#x27;s difficult to succeed as an outsider.<p>When I joined my current company, the CEO was mentored by an extremely well-connected individual. He&#x27;d previously been a CEO of a large Silicon Valley company and was on the board of at least one company that was considerably larger. While both our CEO and him would likely say that the arrangement was solely for mentoring, the end result was that we were acquired by the company that the mentor had formerly led. What started as partnership talks, facilitated by the mentor, quickly turned into M&A.<p>Much like a good VC will provide much more than money, a good mentor will provide much more than just simple coaching.

Marx&#x27;s basic argument in Capital is that labor is what creates value in capital goods. The argument goes like this: if no labor is added to capital goods they eventually rot and become worthless and cease to be a capital good at all. Thus labor is at the heart of what drives value because what gives something value is labor time stored within it. This is at the heart of the exploitation of the workers because the capitalist gets this return without having spent any of their own time to build and develop the capital and they pay less than the value of the capital goods to the workers who made the goods in the first place.<p>Understanding the employee/employer relationship is at heart of understanding capital and the returns capital receive over time. The employee is paid in advance of sales (most of the time) and thus the employer shoulders the risk of those sales never materializing in the first place. To compensate employers for that risk, employees are paid less than the full output of their labor. As we know wages are not taken back if the product or service they were developing was never sold. It&#x27;s a mutually beneficial relationship that explains profits in a way that does not involve exploitation but rather mutually beneficial exchange.<p>If there is no exploitation you don&#x27;t have Marxism in the first place.

For example, her request that Nazre <i>not</i> be fired could have been motivated by a concern for her own safety, or out of a fear that his being fired because of her would lead to out-of-band professional retaliation (against her, or against Kleiner) later on down the road. VC is a clubby world; you can understand why she&#x27;d plead for someone not to be fired, even after being wronged by that person.<p>It&#x27;s also possible that these two seemingly contradictory claims are true: (a) Kleiner Perkins does not have systemic bias against women, and (b) Ellen Pao was a victim of gender discrimination. (I&#x27;m not saying that <i>either</i> is true. I&#x27;m saying that both could be true at the same time.) One case isn&#x27;t a pattern. It might be an isolated fuckup by a now-fired employee that KPCB (out of negligence rather than intentional discrimination) failed to correct. It still needs to be addressed. For example, I might be a person with no pattern or history of killing homeless people (as it were, I am, since I&#x27;ve never killed anyone) but if I go off and kill a homeless person, then I should be tried, convicted and jailed. The lack of a pattern doesn&#x27;t matter. The fact that you could have 99 homeless people testify that I never killed them doesn&#x27;t matter. If I kill one, I belong in jail.<p>Here&#x27;s how it looks to me: Ajit Nazre damaged Ellen Pao&#x27;s reputation within the firm, after she broke off a sexual relationship. He <i>used Kleiner&#x27;s performance review system and its culture</i> to ruin her career. I doubt that its HR system and culture were <i>designed</i> to ruin womens&#x27; careers, but that&#x27;s beside the point. Ill-designed buildings that drop snow or ice on people from great heights, and kill them, weren&#x27;t designed to murder people, but we still hold the developers and architects responsible for negligence.<p>After Nazre destroyed Pao&#x27;s reputation, she struggled to recover and could not. KPCB did not do enough to help her recover; that is clear and obvious to me. It could have reached out and extended invitation to, for example, events like the ski trip and the meeting with Al Gore. It could have formally cleared her name and improved her performance review. As far as I can see, it didn&#x27;t. That may not have been intentional discrimination, but it was severe negligence. It doesn&#x27;t matter whether John Doerr is sexist; it doesn&#x27;t seem that he is. But that&#x27;s not the point. If KPCB didn&#x27;t do enough to clear her name, then it should be held responsible even if it was Nazre himself who was guilty of the gendered component of the harassment.",1427041890

Clearing buffers certainly isn&#x27;t free if you&#x27;re doing it all the time, and considering that high-end gaming already pushes GPU&#x27;s to their max output, the difference between clearing buffers and not clearing them could be noticeable in the end. Of course, it depends completely on <i>how</i> you implement this and when you go about clearing. For example, if a game allocates a pool of GPU memory at the start and then grabs memory for this pool as it needs it, then the OS clearing the buffers hardly matters. If it&#x27;s constantly asking and releasing memory though, then the buffer clearing is important. I honestly don&#x27;t know how the bigger titles handles this, mostly because I don&#x27;t know exactly how different GPU memory is from CPU memory (And if the pool approach is possible).<p>What could be an interesting idea is having a &#x27;GPU security switch&#x27; on the OS level. If it is set on, then GPU memory buffers are cleared at every release. If it&#x27;s off, then they&#x27;re not cleared. My thinking would be that you setup a system in the kernel, somewhat like root access, where by default this switch is on, but a program like a game could suggest that it be turned off for that game to get better performance (And a program like sudo could pop-up with a request box and ask if you want to turn it off, and then ask for the root password to do so). What would be even better is if it could be accomplished on a per-program basis, so only that game&#x27;s memory isn&#x27;t zero&#x27;d (Which probably isn&#x27;t that important of memory anyway) and the rest of your program&#x27;s using the GPU are still zero&#x27;d.",1427041017

The Princeton Review had rated the private tech college as much more selective than the public state college.  Teenage me was confused - how was that possible? - the state school had a significantly lower acceptance rate!<p>The reason is, of course, self-selection bias.  On average, the people who applied for the tech college were just stronger students than the people who applied to the state college.  This likely is because applicants to the tech college were more likely to be people whose primary goal was to peruse an academic discipline that interested them while the state school had a good number of students applying who wanted to party and attend football games.  If you were to look at students who applied to BOTH schools, you would actually see a lower acceptance rate for the tech school than the state school.<p>I suspect that the same factor is at play here.  I suspect that the average quality of a candidate who applies for a software security engineering position is much higher than the average quality of a candidate that applies for a enterprise software development position.  The software security engineering position is an esoteric position that is more likely to attract applicants who are enthusiasts or at least very interested in the field.  The enterprise software development position is more likely to attract anyone with a tech background looking to phone it in and collect a paycheck.<p>If this is true, while both Thomas and Steve have a difficult time hiring developers, they have a difficult time for fundamentally different reasons.  Thomas is like the tech school - his difficulty is with getting candidates to apply.  Steve is like the state school - his problem is with separating qualified candidates from &quot;phone it in and collect a paycheck&quot; candidates.<p>This is why I am skeptical of Thomas thinking he&#x27;s got a much better way of hiring figured out.  Maybe he does for companies that focus on security - judging by his Linkedin profile, he&#x27;s only worked for companies focused on security.  This is certainly valuable, but he has no idea what it is like for Steve.<p>By the way, I think many of us have seen this self-selection bias at play even within our own companies.

It sucks.</i>&quot;<p>Did that country also have laws against carrying firearms? How about laws that prevent individuals from defending themselves? E.g. Castle-doctrine, self-defense, private security firms, etc. You may hail it as proof that without a state, safety is not ensured. But I see it as an unfortunate limbo position where there is no protection provided by the state to the inhabitants, and there are also legal/state obstacles in place to prevent private individuals from performing that function.<p>I live in a country that is in the top 40 on the list of per-capita murder rates in the world. Probably much higher up on the list if you take into account violent crimes, etc. South Africa. It also has a huge industry for security services provided by private companies. Not only that, but a huge population of the country has opted to live in little &quot;security&quot; estates that have controlled access, private security guards, security cameras, electric fences, etc. Neighborhoods that spend large amounts of money on aiding the police in securing their neighborhood using cameras, volunteer patrols, paid private security company patrols, etc. In order to take private security any further, laws need to be removed because they are not being implemented effectively (like the rest of the country, but that&#x27;s a separate debate). E.g. neighborhoods can&#x27;t currently cordon off access to their streets, even if they had permission from all the land owners in the neighborhood. This is also the main reason why so many are moving to security estates, because they&#x27;re huge chunks of private land and as such bypass those rules.<p>>&quot;<i>Even if 90% of people don&#x27;t use violence, that just creates an enormous incentive for the other 10% of people to do so. And those 10%, organized into gangs, can terrorize the other 90%.</i>&quot;<p>One of us is right in this regard. Perhaps it&#x27;s also some sort of gray area where everything except X, Y, Z can be provided for privately without the need for a state. But would you at least concede that we can never know the true point in this spectrum without testing it? I.e. By slowly allowing private companies/individuals to take over safety/security. Note, removing state protection/security services in one go would be disastrous, I would never advocate it as I think it would cause total violent anarchy overnight.",1427040194

It makes the result stand out as a something special, where all the parts have a purpose and are arranged in just the right way. Read <a href=""http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/djb"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/djb</a> to get a better idea of this something:<p><i>djb’s programs are some of the greatest works of beauty to be comprehended by the human mind. As with great art, the outline of the code is somehow visually pleasing — there is balance and rhythm and meter that rivals even the best typography. As with great poetry, every character counts — every single one is there because it needs to be. But these programs are not just for being seen or read — like a graceful dancer, they move! And not just as a single dancer either, but a whole choreographed number — processes splitting and moving and recombining at great speeds, around and around again.<p>But, unlike a dance, this movement has a purpose. They accomplish things that need accomplishing — they find your websites, they ferry your email from place to place. In the most fantastic movies, the routing and sorting of the post office is imagined as a giant endless choreographed dance number.</i>",1427040172

I&#x27;ve never used a diff tool that can accurately track a line of code through big refactoring changes.  They are really only good for small incremental localized changes.<p>I think that says more about the weakness of mainstream diff tools than it says about the problem.  I don&#x27;t really know how difficult it is, but I&#x27;m guessing just a slight amount of semantic understanding would get you way beyond the quality of current diff tools.  Kind of sad that nobody is doing it.  I use Perforce every day on a really large, old code base, and it&#x27;s depressing how awful the differ and &quot;blame&quot; tool are.

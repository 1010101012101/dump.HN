As the article mentions, the field of behavioral economics includes motivations such as fairness and altruism.

8250518,comment,8250052,8250052,3,0,meowface,,,">I said, “I know enough C that I could kick the virus off the machines,” and I did. They said “Wow, that was really cool. Why don’t you do that again?” Then I started kicking off other viruses, and they said, “That’s pretty cool that you kicked all the viruses off. Why don’t you kick the competitors off, too?”\n>It was funny. It really showed me the power of gradualism. It’s hard to get people to do something bad all in one big jump, but if you can cut it up into small enough pieces, you can get people to do almost anything.<p>This rings incredibly true to me. Especially in my job field.<p>edit:<p>>The good news is that I’ve been on the other side of those automated script things. Their capability is incredibly dangerous, but the actuality tends not to be.\n>It would have been fairly trivial for me to go spelunking for people’s credit card information or whatever. I had four million nodes. I could have done it without anybody at the company even noticing. I was the guy writing Scheme, so I could have just put a text file somewhere and then made it go away, and there wouldn’t even have been an executable lying around.\n>But I didn’t. To do that, by definition you have to be willing to become a criminal, and that’s a little bit rare. So I’m not too worried about that.<p>I also think this is a good point. A lot of services out there could potentially ruin your life (or at least make it difficult) if there&#x27;s a rogue employee who targets you (or targets a lot of people). An ISP employee looking at web logs, a Google employee reading all your emails... The same goes for the NSA, just the power that can be abused is even larger.<p>I think it&#x27;s inevitable that human ability to access these kinds of things will never become impossible, so I hope that companies (and the NSA) are instituting controls and checks, including anomaly detection, to find rogue, malicious, or snooping employees.",1409522349

You&#x27;re not wrong, in payments they will certainly take more credit than they are due. But, they will increase the uptake more than anyone through their implementation and you have to give them credit for that.<p>The interesting thing about that insight is that it does seem as though people are trying to copy Apple before they have even entered the arena. They will probably, fairly or unfairly, also get credit for creating the wearables market. My best guess is that Apple will freeze the market on Sept 9th with a product that is far superior.

8250384,comment,8248869,8248869,8,0,tgb,,,"I don&#x27;t like this article. Here are my main concerns:<p>1) The review article cited at the start concludes its abstract with this:<p>&quot;Although the literature on learning styles is enormous, very few studies have even used an experimental methodology capable of testing the validity of learning styles applied to education. Moreover, of those that did use an appropriate method, several found results that flatly contradict the popular meshing hypothesis.<p>We conclude therefore, that at present, there is no adequate evidence base to justify incorporating learning-styles assessments into general educational practice. Thus, limited education resources would better be devoted to adopting other educational practices that have a strong evidence base, of which there are an increasing number. However, given the lack of methodologically sound studies of learning styles, it would be an error to conclude that all possible versions of learning styles have been tested and found wanting; many have simply not been tested at all.&quot;<p>I would happily replace the entire linked article with these two half paragraphs! Note that this means we don&#x27;t know there isn&#x27;t learning styles; we just know that those handful of ones so far tested have proven ineffective.<p>2) That a classroom does better with a math-through-music approach does not mean that all students do better through that. The cited article for this study doesn&#x27;t appear to make that claim or any claim about the existence of learning styles (but it&#x27;s paywalled). Clearly a classroom learns better when instructed in a language that the students understand - does that mean that learning styles don&#x27;t exist?<p>3) That classes learn best when given a mixture of styles of information does not mean that there are no learning styles. (If you told me that mixing styles improves a class&#x27;s learning, that would make me think it more likely that learning styles exist - otherwise it&#x27;s more likely that there&#x27;s some optimal single method that is better than trying all available methods.)",1409519327

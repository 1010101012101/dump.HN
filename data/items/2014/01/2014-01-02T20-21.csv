7002237,comment,7001929,7001929,1,0,prawks,,,"A massive component I see to rest vs. work is flexible scheduling, not just vacation time. You don&#x27;t need as much time off if you are working at a pace where you are comfortable and not overly stressed. I&#x27;m not sure it applies to startup founders who lack the security of a stable job or demand delivery for immediate market presence, but for people with more wiggle room working &quot;slower&quot; and smarter is very rewarding, and in my experience yields higher quality results due to a more ample time to digest ideas.<p>It also can carry a perhaps heftier social stigma than extensive vacationing if viewed in the wrong light, because of the potential for abuse. If I watch a movie in the middle of the day between working, how is that viewed? Is it different than if I were to take a mid-afternoon bike ride on a Tuesday for a couple of hours? They are both ways that I can decompress and allow me to come back to ideas later with a fresh perspective, and that&#x27;s sometimes the most valuable thing to me when I&#x27;m working.<p>I would take flexible scheduling over excessive vacation time any day of the week, and I&#x27;m fortunate that the software engineering field is one where working from anywhere at any time is extremely easy.",1388696340

7002215,comment,7000877,7002090,1,0,jerryr,,,"Yeah, I can see how the cost argument is borderline--it really depends upon what you value & connectivity is pretty important nowadays. But, unless the primary application is specifically &quot;connected robots&quot;, I do think it makes sense to omit it for the first rev and get a cheaper product out faster. Don&#x27;t forget that the $10 is the cost of the part itself.* You still need some support circuitry, hardware development time, software development time, testing time, etc. And then there&#x27;s markup. Assuming absolute minimal costs for all of those--and direct sales with an aggressively minimal margin, I&#x27;d still expect a $10 part cost to translate to at least a $20 product cost.<p>* Admittedly, that $10 is <i>budgetary</i> pricing and would probably come down with negotiation (and there might be cheaper low-volume options--that&#x27;s just one I knew of offhand).

Pins may not be perfectly round, pin chambers may not be in alignment, etc. Small small differences, but when you apply a very light pressure to the pins, you&#x27;ll actually bind the &quot;weirdest&quot; one first. You aren&#x27;t binding every pin, just one at a time, when that one is set, you move on to the next weirdest.<p>The order the pins set in will be unique to the lock, not a universal sequence. In fact, the order will change depending on the direction you pick, and even two locks pinned exactly the same will likely set pins in a different order.<p>This is called the &quot;tentative method&quot; and it was pioneered in the late 1700s. This idea of tension & manipulation can be applied to nearly every mechanical locking system (there are a very small number of exceptions).",1388695939

IMHO you got your coffee-pizza-beer comparison entirely wrong. 650$ is a lot of pizza. Exactly. So the service must provide a heck of a lot of value – more than if I put two coders of my business on a few night shifts to implement the same functionality (or use frameworks that do the same) and supply them with unlimited pizza for the rest of the year.

In a feudal world, the peasants didn&#x27;t care much which king ruled over their land, they didn&#x27;t identify much with their nation. That changed when everything grew closer together. I think new means of communication and transportation greatly helped with building a national identity (and later were used for propaganda). The rise of capitalism and the bourgeois/civil society were also neccessary factors. Why do I say this was driven by technology? Because the begin of modern capitalism is inseparable from the industrial revolution. In the end of course it&#x27;s not just a causal chain, but a very complicated development.<p>Anyway, what I was trying to say is that when people have hopes for the future, they often think of great technological breakthroughs, continuing the progress of the 20th century. A cure for cancer, fusion energy, robots and AI, .... I think the biggest breakthroughs will be on another field: How can we make a global economy that is not so riddled by crises? How can we distribute wealth better? Can we build a society without money? How do we make better descisions as a society (E.g. the political system in the US is clearly broken right now)? How do we ensure the freedom and libery of everybody? How do we prevent wars? etc. etc.<p>There were a bunch of ideas in the last few centuries in this field, some better, some not - constitutional monarcy, the republic, democracy (parlamentary, or council), socialism, communism (the dozen or so ideas and sytems that called themselves such), social market economy, the stuff they&#x27;re doing in china right now, and so on. In the last few decades, the consensus seemd to be that these are mostly ideologies, and ideology is dead and capitalism+western democracy has won. Now, we are seeing our system fail slowly, too, and we seem pretty helpless about it. It won&#x27;t help to throw ever new technologies at it. But I think by learning from the mistakes of past societies, but also from what they got right, we should be able to gradually develop a new kind of society that ensures prosperity, freedom, fairness and peace.<p>I hope this was not too incoherent to understand :-)",1388695382

I think it involves the EU member states being much less compatible and much more storied than US member states, and also the EU as an organization being much younger.<p>I believe it&#x27;s evident that when you fly a bunch of groups under a single banner successfully for a long time, what starts as a loose, powerless alliance with only administrative activities (as the US was originally conceived) eventually becomes a very strong central power apparatus (as the US has now become).<p>Maybe it&#x27;ll be different in Europe where the member states have so much independent history. Everything out here was basically a blank slate before it was annexed by the Union. In the relatively few places where this isn&#x27;t true, there is much stronger anti-federal sentiment (the South, Hawaii).

I always pull and never fetch, which helps slightly, but only slightly; pull seems to fetch other branches, so it&#x27;s still possible to have my copy of a branch end up behind my remote-tracking copy of that branch. There&#x27;s no command analogous to pull for &quot;add and commit and push&quot;, so that&#x27;s always a second step to possibly forget (I don&#x27;t want to rely on an alias as I work on a number of different machines). Most problematic at the moment is that there&#x27;s no way to tell the difference between an up-to-date branch and a non-remote-tracking branch, so I sometimes delete branches that I haven&#x27;t fully pushed, because I forgot to make them remote-tracking, so they didn&#x27;t show up as behind when I &quot;git status&quot;ed.",1388693763

As we added in apps like OpenOffice and GIMP it became much more of an issue.<p>So, we have the PA.c Installer able to take directives like whether or not to preserve everything in App, whether to preserve or remove specific files, whether to preserver or remove specific directories, etc.  In addition to overwriting the existing files with the new ones, of course.  This made life a lot easier on everyone.  And users didn&#x27;t need to worry about manually deleting specific directories but keeping others when updating.  You just point the new version to the same X:\\PortableApps\\AppNamePortable directory and it intelligently upgrades.  It even supports custom code for things that fall outside those simple keep/preserve so we can specifically remove certain settings on an upgrade where a given app breaks its own settings and doesn&#x27;t support the old ones, etc.<p>For example, I just wrote the package for FreeCommander XE Portable for the publisher to release.  The new one doesn&#x27;t support the old settings and will break if they remain, so I have the installer back them up within Data (just in case the user wants to revert manually later).  I then had it read the preferred language from the old settings and write them into the new ones for the user for convenience.  I could get more explicit and read/write other settings as well if I had the time.",1388693577

7001926,comment,7000612,7000612,1,0,aaronem,,,"Seriously! [1]<p>> The Black Chamber’s sophisticated hacking operations go way beyond using software vulnerabilities to gain access to targeted systems. The Chamber has a catalog of tools available that would make James Bond’s Q jealous, providing Chamber analysts access to just about every potential source of data about a target.<p>> In some cases, the Black Chamber has modified the firmware of computers and network hardware—including systems shipped by Cisco, Dell, Hewlett-Packard, Huawei, and Juniper Networks—to give its operators both eyes and ears inside the offices the Chamber has targeted. In others, the Black Chamber has crafted custom BIOS exploits that can survive even the reinstallation of operating systems. And in still others, the Black Chamber has built and deployed its own USB cables at target locations—complete with spy hardware and radio transceiver packed inside.<p>> [...]<p>> Either way, the altering of systems’ firmware or hardware gives the Black Chamber the ability to install backdoors that can survive a total operating system wipe and re-installation. One BIOS attack, called SWAP, was developed by the Black Chamber to attack a number of types of computers and operating systems by loading surveillance and control software at boot-up. SWAP uses the Host Protected Area on a computer’s hard drive to store the payload and installs it before the operating system boots.<p>> [...]<p>> An implanted wireless device is the Black Chamber’s go-to approach for dealing with “air-gapped” networks—networks that don’t have an Internet connection for security reasons. There are a number of other implanted devices that the Black Chamber has in its TAO arsenal, including USB and Ethernet implants that can transmit short-range radio signals and more robust implanted hardware for longer-range transmissions. These radio links create a shadow Internet that allows the Black Chamber to move data out of an adversary’s network and into its TURMOIL and X-KEYSCORE collection system.<p>> [...]<p>> But why stop at network data? The Black Chamber also uses some fairly exotic tools to grab computer video, keyboard strokes, and even audio from inside more difficult-to-reach places by using passive electronic devices that are actually powered by radar. These devices, charged by a specially tuned continuous wave radio signal sent from a portable radar unit (operating at as little as 2W up to as much as 1kW of power in the 1-2GHz range), send back a data stream as a reflected signal, allowing the Black Chamber’s operators to tune in and view what’s happening on a computer screen or even listen to what’s being said in the room as they paint the target with radio frequency energy—as well as giving a relative rough location of devices within a building for the purposes of tracking or targeting.<p>> Hacking smartphones<p>> The 2007 Black Chamber wish book for analysts also includes a number of software tools that allow data to be stolen from a variety of smartphones and dumb cell phones. One software hack, called DROPOUTJEEP, is a software implant for Apple iOS devices that allows the Black Chamber to remotely control and monitor nearly all the features of an iPhone, including geolocation, text messages, and the microphone and camera. (Researcher and developer Jake Appelbaum, who helped write the Spiegel article revealing the documents, said separately this week that the Black Chamber claims DROPOUTJEEP installations are always successful.) Another package, called TOTEGHOSTLY, does the same for phones based on the Windows Mobile embedded operating system.<p>> [...]<p>> But these aren&#x27;t the only way the Black Chamber can get to cell phone data. Also in the bag of tricks are a number of wireless monitoring devices, as well as “networks in a box” and other gear that can pose as cell towers and networks—intercepting devices as they enter an area and grabbing up their voice, data, and SMS traffic. A &quot;tripwire&quot; program called CANDYGRAM can send out alerts whenever a cell phone hits a specified cell tower.<p>> Old tricks, new tricks<p>> It’s important to note that the exploits in the documents are largely over five years old, so they don’t necessarily give a complete picture of what the Black Chamber is capable of today. That doesn’t mean that these techniques are no longer in circulation—given the stubbornness of Windows XP, many of the exploits developed for older Windows platforms may have years left in them, and some of the adversaries the Black Chamber is trying to monitor don’t have Fortune 500 hardware refresh rates.<p>It&#x27;s long past time.<p>[1] <a href""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=699122"" rel""nofollo"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=6991227</a>",1388693484

7001872,comment,6999660,7001297,2,0,jerf,,,"The thing I hate about modern political economic rhetoric is how basic econ 101 has become <i>political</i>, or even <i>moral</i>. In fact as you can see by my <i>entire last paragraph</i>, I in fact do not have blind faith in &quot;the free market&quot; to always function perfectly with no intervention, but thanks to the thought-destroying moralizing that accompanies our political discourse, I know that the instant I say &quot;free market&quot; about 75% of my audience just shut off their brain.<p>Even that might not be so bad, if a huge chunk of the audience did not consider it their <i>moral duty</i> to shut off their brain.<p>Yes, what a free market <i>does</i> is match supply and demand via price signals. It is the aforementioned Econ 101, using mechanisms discussed in Econ 101, which are all mostly math and border on physics. What people don&#x27;t <i>like</i> is that it does so entirely <i>a</i>-morally (not <i>im</i>-morally as some would like you to think, but actually <i>a</i>-morally, with no particular regard for human morals), so you will sometimes not like how it does it (thus, price gouging laws during emergencies; the free market is trying to balance a sudden supply shock with skyrocketing prices, and we don&#x27;t <i>like</i> that), and sometimes we have to intervene to prevent it from amorally doing something we don&#x27;t want to happen at all (hence the need to sometimes straight-up ban things; a free market will efficiently price slaves, drugs, or hit jobs perfectly amorally), but in the normal case, what a free market does is match supply to demand with price signals, regardless of whether we &quot;like&quot; the result or not. It is sufficiently efficient at this that a long-term failure to match up supply & demand is extremely strong evidence (though not quite 100% proof) that there is not a free market where the mismatch is occurring; something&#x27;s fiddling with the prices outside of normal supply and demand mechanisms. (An interesting example in the other direction is that our War On Drugs has been rather ineffective, as can be shown by the fact that supply and demand are often quite well matched up via pricing; despite our best efforts there still <i>is</i> a fairly free market in drugs!)",1388692909

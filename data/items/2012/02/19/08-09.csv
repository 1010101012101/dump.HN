3608991,comment,3607217,3608418,2,0,etherael,,,"Firstly, the downvotes are a recent manifestation of creeping groupthink. They're disheartening, but they're actually a good example in this particular instance as an illustration that people as a whole, even in places where you'd expect them to be, aren't so smart. It's much easier to have a gut reaction to a position and grunt a downvote out than actually engage in reasoned discussion and <i>THINK</i> about it.<p>Even speaking as an agorist, your faith in the market is a little extreme. It certainly has some useful and beneficial efficiencies to be sure, but believing that it will simply elevate the best and create a rising tide that will raise all standards is a little naive I think with regards to what we see in the world where markets reign.<p>Assuming humans are perfectly rational agents with equal information it works, but that's not how humans really are. Humans are dumb, panicky, emotional animals, and the difference between the most incompetent of them and say cows are not as wide as our politically correct institutions would like to force us to believe.<p>You would do well, even in an ancap society, to voluntarily donate to charities that pursued socially beneficial objectives so that you reaped the benefits of their actions. This is pretty much the ancap response to tragedy of the commons. Vaccination and libraries are not a bad example of where this makes sense imho. There's nothing strictly contrary to ancap doctrine to point out that choosing not to clean your proverbial home will result in you living in a mess, so you might want to do that occasionally.<p>It is not enough to point out that simply because states provably fail, markets are perfectly efficient.",1329641764
3608990,comment,3606243,3608864,1,0,latch,,,"The interview process provides very little information to both parties about each other. Both of you have to make a decision on what you know. It is entirely possible that walking away from such an interview would, in retrospect, be a mistake.<p>However, it's a hot market. For every company that sucks at interviews, there's a company that's good at it. Why put up with it? Why waste hours?<p>Once upon a time, I was interviewing at two companies. The first, was a great interview..the seasoned and experienced found/CEO got me excited and interested and really made me feel that they were equally excited and interested in having me on board. They asked smart questions, they had obviously spent time reading my blog and looking at my public profile.<p>At the other company, it was painful...for both of us. I felt..like a chore that had to be done...going through a checklist of increasingly irrelevant questions. You could challenge the question, but the answer was ""we want to see how you work through problems""....which is silly...are you so lazy that you can't come up with relevant questions that do that? Plenty of other people have.<p>My point is that, like everything else, some companies are clearly 10x better at interviewing/hiring than others. And, again like everything else, the shitty companies/interviewers have no clue how shitty they are.<p>Surely that might say something about the individuals and companies as a whole? So, again, why put up with it?",1329641636

Set up your company outside of the US.<p>2. Don't keep a bank account in the same country that your company is in.<p>3. Don't have customers in the same country that your country is in or where your bank account is.<p>4. Don't live in the country where your company, bank account or customers are.<p>5. Don't live in the same time zone as your in-laws.<p>I live in Thailand (for 13 years now) and have a company in Singapore.  We are opening companies in Laos this year then Cambodia and then Burma over the next two years.  My Bank Accounts are in Hong Kong.  I try to find customers in any country other than those listed above, and the States.<p>Bandwidth is better out here than in most places in the States.  And hardware is cheaper because you're buying closer to the source.  And as long as you aren't living in Singapore, Hong Kong or Toyko, the cost of living is far cheaper than in the States.<p>This is not as difficult as it might seem.  It's great living out here, and I would encourage everyone to do the same.<p>BTW our latest startup is an infrastructure for the semantic Web and about as cutting edge as you could hope for, so don't whine about how you can only do your startup in Silicon Valley.

Anyone in that 43 million that is not of working age or ability decreases your magic percentage. You are trying to paint your 80% as ""percentage of people who could work, but don't"" whereas it's actually ""percentage of poor people in the labour force, including children and the infirm""<p>- the overall labour force for the US is 65% of the total population. Using this number against the 40 million for those in poverty would suggest ~26 million potential labour force instead. Throw in children, mentally ill, and similarly overrepresented demographics and that number reduces again.<p>- your linked comment mentions this interesting metric ""FTLFPR"", used to vilify the poor... which when googled shows only a handful of results which are a combination of typos, random character pages, and your comment. Even chasing your linked comment to a quoted paper about participation a few comment up doesn't exhibit that acronym.<p>- Even assuming that your acronym is a real measure, it's hardly suprising that people who can't get enough work are poor. Those people who are classed as unemployed are going to be dragging that acronym down signficantly - and almost one in ten of the labour force is unemployed in the US.<p>- You make the gross mistake of assuming motive. Since the GFC hit, the US unemployment rate doubled from 4.5% to 9%. By your reckoning this means that one in twenty workers in the past few years has decided to just refuse work so they can ""buy alcohol, crack cocaine and satellite TV""<p><a href=""http://data.bls.gov/timeseries/LNS14000000"" rel=""nofollow"">http://data.bls.gov/timeseries/LNS14000000</a><p>When it comes down to it, yes, there are some people who game the system.

Sure, x86 is now the dominant ISA in many markets, but the notion of abstraction from hardware implementation was around for at least 10 years before the 8086 processor (IBM 360).",1329638911

Some of my tasks can't easily be broken down into accept/reject, or sometimes a worker gets something <i>close</i> but not all the way there. I want to be able to say ""hey, you did pretty well, but please make these small changes and we'll accept it.""<p>But that's not possible right now. You get the HIT and it's accepted or rejected. The result is that we have to sometimes reject workers who are making an honest effort but didn't sufficiently complete the task or we have to accept sub-par answers so as to not have to deal with worker blowback.",1329638650

51649,comment,51422,51504,0,0,epi0Bauqu,,,"The link still isn't working.<p>But this is not an assumption on my part.  It is from experience.  At my last startup, we ran the entire most everything over https because it yielded better sign up numbers and payment conversions (pre-payment page).  We had at some points over 50K people signing up daily (and of course many many more hitting the initial sign up page and current users logging in and clicking around).  The registration # is to give you an idea of scope.  All of this still ran fine one dual CPU machine, i.e. all the https didn't hit the server too hard to where it mattered.<p>So I guess I'm not disputing https takes a lot more CPU than http, but in the aggregate, with a decent machine, it just isn't going to matter.   This is especially true if you just do it for authentication, and yes I was thinking of the same cookie process as described by mdakin when making the original comment.",1189169622

51646,comment,51578,51619,0,0,brlewis,,,"Predictably, yes.<p>I've learned at least two things watching people misunderstand essays.  First, when an essay touches on a polarizing issue, people tend to peg it as one end or the other of that polarization.  Second, once people peg an essay as making an argument that they disagree with, they stop paying attention, if they keep reading at all.<p>I'm not trying to be critical of anyone; I tend to do the same thing.<p>Quote: I hear variations of this same tired argument probably once or twice a month. (It comes with the territory when you write a book titled <i>How to Become a Straight-A Student</i>).<p>He has you lumped in with the rest of his critics.  ""Obedience to authority"" is a collective quote from the lot of you, with your words ""index of obedience"" as just one fuzzy part.<p>What's funny is in the end he agrees with your last three paragraphs.  Quote: It's fine to make the point that college and grades aren't everything. In fact it's important.... I'll be the first say it: <i>College is not necessary for success!</i>

He's making assertions about Naggum's assertions. For that purpose, the ill-informed rant in question is an excellent source of corroboration.",1189169316

51643,comment,51451,51451,0,0,damon,,,"Linus is hellbent on not working with ""substandard programmers"" and chooses his tools accordingly.  Bad programmers are really counterproductive and he's <i>damn</i> brilliant for weeding them out so aggressively.<p>In his ""I'm a bastard"" post to the linux kernel thread in 2000, he lambasted people arguing for a kernel debugger.  His argument, clear as day, says he doesn't want to work with people who depend on the debugger , he wants people to understand the code as a whole. <p>""Oh. And sure, when things crash and you fsck, and you didn't even get a clue about what went wrong, you get frustrated. Tough. There are two kinds of reactions to that: you start being careful, or you start whining about a kernel debugger.<p>Quite frankly, I'd rather weed out the people who don't start being careful early, rather than late. That sounds callous, and by God, it is callous. But it's not the kind of ""if you can't stand the heat, get out the the kitchen"" kind of remark that some people take it for. No, it's something much more deeper: I'd rather not work with people who aren't careful. It's Darwinism in software development.""<p>
Here, 7 years later, he applies much the same argument to C++:<p>""C++ is a horrible language. It's made more horrible by the fact that a lot 
of substandard programmers use it, to the point where it's much much 
easier to generate total and utter crap with it. Quite frankly, even if 
the choice of C were to do <i>nothing</i> but keep the C++ programmers out, 
that in itself would be a huge reason to use C.""<p>""And limiting your project to C means that people 
don't screw that up, and also means that you get a lot of programmers that 
do actually understand low-level issues and don't screw things up with any 
idiotic ""object model"" crap.""<p>Call him a prick, call him selfish, call him egotistical, the bottom line is he's in charge of a product that is much bigger, more complicated, diverse, mature, and successful than the majority on the planet.  Smart hackers will get past their emotion and understand his principles are sound, proven, and successful.

51640,comment,51397,51590,0,0,steveplace,,,"I know we're diverging from the original topic a bit, but I'd like to make a couple of comments about 'Good to Great.' I enjoyed it solely on the fact that there was a tremendous amount of research and data mining involved. He set it up as close to experimental standards as you could get in that area and pulled out the threads with the highest correlation. Adding buzzwords like hedgehog to it, however, is another story.<p>Since I have a mild fetish for management books, I've drawn a couple conclusions on the whole genre itself. 'Clever ideas' are subjective. I feel that if a book gives you a straight-line recipe to success, then the message has failed because it has overlooked the nuance and gray(grey?) areas that is associated with running organizations and working with people.<p>Enough of this; back to the topic at hand.",1189168536

51637,comment,51462,51562,0,0,mattculbreth,,,"For datawarehouse applications you're (obviously) doing many more reads than writes.  The number of columns you return for any given ad hoc query is typically low.  Take something like ""give me the names and salaries of employees who missed more than 3 days last quarter and who also work in California"".  <p>Since a single datamart might have 200 columns spread across dimension and fact tables, and since this query is only touching 5-6 of them, it pays to make it easy to get to individual columns, instead of reading entire rows.  In a row-store database you'd have to read the main fact table rows and the Employee and Office dimension rows, and that might add up to 50 columns.  If you can only touch the exact columns you need you're better off.<p>All that said, I've never done it.  I really need to get an open source column store and whack at it for a bit.<p>",1189167893

I was hoping for self-organisation, and it just seemed like a good idea at the time: work on a project with somebody over the weekend, to test the waters for co-founding a start-up. Just start a group on Ning for your project, or join an existing group, and start developing. ",1189166769

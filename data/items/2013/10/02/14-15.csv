I wouldn&#x27;t bother with Play for a basic CRUD app, it makes you do too much grunt work yourself (e.g., authentication).  But when you have a backend built on Akka and want to build a reactive, event-driven front-end Play makes it trivial.<p>Akka is the key.  Its actor model just makes <i>reasoning</i> about concurrency so easy because of how it deals with state.  Add in remoting and clustering and you&#x27;ve got a highly scalable, event-driven clustered backend without too much extra work on your part.  Play fits into that sort of ecosystem quite nicely.",1380725791

At the time, it was a pretty beefy card, and drives my three 23&quot; monitors really well... in Windows.<p>Late 2012 is when I found that enough bugs were fixed in the [now AMD] proprietary drivers to where I could get serious work done in Linux. The crashes were mostly fixed, but there are still lots of performance issues, as well as a lot of fun bugs (like my cursor randomly turning into a 20x50 block of randomly colored pixels when moving between monitors).<p>It&#x27;s been a dreadful experience. The AMD driver releases stopped coming with changelogs for about 6 months, and they still don&#x27;t always release them (or when they do, they leave a lot out). When a new version of Xorg comes out, it takes them at least two months to add support (while nvidia often has support ready before release, or very shortly after). nvidia, even with their own issues, shows them up enough to make me envious. Intel is really taking things to a higher level with their drivers + OpenGL performance lately, too.<p>If you have to use proprietary drivers (like I do for 3D/OpenGL), stay the heck away from AMD. They do an awful job with their Linux drivers. Linus likes to bitch at nvidia, but their binary Linux drivers are leagues better than AMD&#x27;s.

Feel free to summarily disregard. ;-)<p>Play is an evolution for sure. But I&#x27;d consider it &quot;beyond&quot;. Validation concerns are where they should be: At input. Not the Models. Comet, Websockets, etc are all trivial. Chunked Responses FTW. You don&#x27;t need different responders. Render _anything_ by having a Writable in-scope.<p>Our API calls to render our models as JSON look like this:<p><pre><code>  api.photos.get(id) map(Ok(_))\n</code></pre>\nThe plugin universe isn&#x27;t there yet, but I tend to think most apps out-grow most framework plugins pretty quickly.<p>Honestly, I find Play/Scala _more_ productive than Ruby MVC in general. Fewer bugs. Much better performance and memory usage, so fewer constraints (that one is <i>huge</i>). Rework is much easier, but also much less necessary. The language itself is a joy (IMO) to work with.<p>The Java ecosystem is a huge enabler. You can have complete control over resizing images in ImgScalr, faster, with no external dependencies, in less code and a flatter learning curve than anything I&#x27;ve ever used in Ruby. Scala itself presents a lot of new things to learn and get comfortable with language-wise until you feel you&#x27;re back in the groove, but once you&#x27;ve got it, I&#x27;ve found that the ecosystem makes the complex things much easier, and the language itself makes the easy things engaging as well.<p>Ruby doesn&#x27;t really help much trying to tackle hard problems IME. Image Resizing? Better shell out to ImageMagick. Dubbing a video? Hello shell my old friend. Cache coherency across a cluster? Fire up another external service (maybe Redis) to manage and start working through failure modes and failover scripts if you care about availability. Compare that to Hazelcast. Need to serve static assets? Better setup an NGinx proxy. In-memory near-caching? You don&#x27;t have the memory for it, and the GC can&#x27;t handle it anyways, stick to Redis.<p>Put a crew of experienced Play developers head-to-head with experienced Rails developers, give them the same goals (and <i>non-goals</i>), and you&#x27;ll have a faster, more maintainable solution from the Play team in the same or less time for anything but the most trivial apps.<p>IMO. :-)",1380725488

6482680,comment,6482169,6482169,9,0,mdasen,,,"I feel like this isn&#x27;t asking the right question.  The answers you&#x27;re going to get are going to be a combination of a) people&#x27;s perception of what Rails and Django can do and b) people&#x27;s perception of what the future of the web.<p>So, let&#x27;s first look at what Rails and Django can do.  Ruby and Python are both slow languages compared to Java, Go, C, and even JavaScript (thanks to companies pouring a lot of work into it).  However, computing power is increasing.  In the Ruby and Rails world, there has been good work on JRuby, Puma, etc. to help concurrency and move away from the process-based concurrency model.  I&#x27;m less familiar with Django here, but Python does have frameworks built for concurrency.<p>Now let&#x27;s look at Node.js, Java, and Go.  All three have good support for handling multiple connections within the same process (via. eventing, threading, and goroutines).  Rather than taking up a process per connection, they just add a little bit of RAM overhead and get to stay in the same memory space with cheaper context switching (or none in an evented system).  That deals well with long-running processes that would otherwise block a process, tie up RAM, etc.<p>So, Rails is improving its support for running in a threaded environment and while I don&#x27;t know as much about Django, Python does have other options addressing this issue.  But as it stands today, alternatives have a speed advantage and somewhat by-default operate in a better way for concurrency.<p>Now, if we&#x27;re looking toward the future, what do we need this for?  We don&#x27;t need this for things like serving CRUD.  If you&#x27;re trying to keep lots of connections for a chat application waiting for a response, that can be better served by alternatives.  However, it should be noted that 37signals does chat via Rails.  When thinking about the future, you should think about what is happening in the application and how that affects things like context switching, RAM usage, etc.  I don&#x27;t want to predict the future.  If you want to, think about how applications may work that would be better served by systems that don&#x27;t rely on process-based concurrency.<p>As some unsolicited closing advice, I find that a lot of people spend an inordinate amount of time worrying over their tools.  They want to pick the one set of tools that will last for eternity.  Just as your laptop will age and be replaced, the code you write will.  Obsessing over tools keeps many from doing anything.  There&#x27;s a lot of low hanging fruit.  I&#x27;m guessing you see things you want to build - things you could improve upon.  Don&#x27;t worry about having to modify, extend, and do things differently in the future if it&#x27;s keeping you from doing anything today.  Tools are just that: tools.  They aren&#x27;t your product.  They&#x27;re meaningful.  Using a better tool is more enjoyable and can create a better outcome.  But don&#x27;t obsess about it trying to guess the future and insulate yourself from future work.  Build!",1380725122

If you find putting together CRUD apps and laying out contact forms challenging and engaging after ten years, you may lack the mental capacity to really appreciate and understand why programming is terrible.<p>The reason open source software exists is because programming is terrible - if programming were the digital orgasm that these people pretend it is, people wouldn&#x27;t have been bitching for years about how bad the open source ORM they&#x27;re using is - they would have rewritten it already, twice.<p>Programming is a menial mental task for anyone with the capacity to properly abstract their real world problem into a solution that a computer can understand, with a few bits of crunchy debugging on top, that has no reward on its own.<p>We program, not because it is fun, challenging, or fulfilling, but because it is morphologically necessary for our continued existence as solution creators and problem solvers.<p>90% of the time spent programming is a slog.

In fact, there&#x27;s even another layer to it: shortly after birth, people tend to count in weeks rather than months.<p>My guess at an answer is that human beings are more comfortable thinking about numbers that are small integers (between 1 and 20 or so?), and that (roughly speaking) we often want to be able to give a bit more precision than you&#x27;d get from just &quot;1&quot; vs. &quot;2&quot;.[1]<p>So for baby growth, parents will talk about how many days old their child is for the first week or so, and then use &quot;weeks&quot; for the first few months, and then use &quot;months&quot; until they&#x27;re around 2 years old. (There&#x27;s also a real sense in which the pace of child development seems to progress on a sort of log scale: change is <i>very</i> rapid at first, but gradually slows down. The use of different age units seems to roughly parallel that.)<p>As an aside, this same human preference is presumably also why the English developed different units for (say) inches, feet, and miles rather than using one of those units for everything. [Side note: is there any common English unit between yards and miles? I grew up using &quot;blocks&quot;, which is handy, but that&#x27;s pretty city-specific.]<p>[1] By &quot;precision&quot; I&#x27;m thinking more or less about &quot;relative uncertainty&quot;. If you assume that an integer value is accurate to within +/- 0.5, then the percent uncertainty on 1 or 2 is so large as to make the information almost useless, while the implied uncertainty on a big number like 50 is probably smaller than is justified for most contexts.",1380724106

But something bugs me about this kind of discussion.<p>There are two broad classes of attackers: targeted attackers, who specifically want to get into your system, and script kiddies who are scanning broad swaths of the Internet looking for an easy target. Most of these countermeasures, like port knocking and moving sshd to a different port, do very little to dissuade the first group. But they make you much less of a target for the second group.<p>These discussions (and so many security discussions on the internet) make the argument that unless something is effective against targeted attackers, it&#x27;s not worth doing. That&#x27;s ridiculous. In the 20+ years I&#x27;ve been running computers on the internet, targeted attackers are outnumbered by random scans thousands to one. Of course, you&#x27;ll say, any countermeasure that&#x27;s good enough to stop targeted attackers is good enough to stop these guys as well. And that&#x27;s true, but for two things:<p>1. I like my logging and alerting to intentionally be loud when a targeted attacker is messing with my system. By raising the bar enough so that <i>only</i> targeted attackers get through, I&#x27;m able to do that.<p>2. There have been zero-day vulnerabilities in probably most of the daemons I&#x27;ve run over the years. And when those zero-days come, I inevitably get hit with <i>random</i> scans looking for vulnerable versions. Those are almost always stopped cold by things as simple as running on a different port. I&#x27;d like to think I&#x27;m pretty good at keeping up with vulnerability alerts and updating my software when something like that happens, but simple changes that buy me a little time aren&#x27;t a bad thing.",1380723886

That said:<p>- Much like MongoDB, the defaults sacrifice safety for performance, e.g. MyISAM tables (which everyone everywhere will tell you never to use, but are IIRC still the default) ignore things like foreign key constraints<p>- Lots of &quot;error&quot; conditions silently complete as best as they can, rather than failing with an error. E.g. trying to store the wrong type of value, or trying to make a table using a disabled storage engine, or trying to store a string in an encoding that can&#x27;t represent all its characters. A lot of this is legacy that is slowly being improved on, but reputation naturally lags slightly behind<p>- The query planner is a bit simplistic, so if you want performance you do need to put a little more thought into tables so that you&#x27;re not doing 5-way joins all the time<p>- Some more advanced &quot;features&quot; of other databases like triggers just don&#x27;t exist. IMO they are bad features and shouldn&#x27;t be used, but their absence provides an easy thing to criticize mysql for if you&#x27;re that way inclined<p>It&#x27;s perfectly possible to make a good product using MySQL, quite possibly better than you would with other databases. But you do need to be very scrupulous about checking for warnings after every statement.",1380723873

In the same way that Rails inspired frameworks in other languages - new technologies like node and meteor can inspire Rails too.<p>For example, at aha.io we use Rails, and wanted to get the front-end performance of a Javascript-heavy app, but by taking advantage of what we know (which is writing ActiveRecord models, Rails controllers and ERB views). So we borrowed a technique from Meteor and made our views reactive - using Rails for the view rendering. That way we get the best of both worlds: the code only needs to be written once in Ruby, but the performance and reactivity is like an app that has a Javascript front-end.<p>This is just one example, but there lots of similar examples (think about the increasing use of functional programming styles). The incredibly rich ecosystem around Rails means that stuff just gets done faster - the ecosystem has done most of the work for you. Apart from Django, every other framework is still playing catchup.",1380723682

Bouncing back and forth between legacy Windows and &quot;Modern&quot; UI is obviously unsatisfactory. But, remember that Microsoft tried a gradual, familiar evolutionary approach three times previously and failed. Where were you then?<p>Now Microsoft has a new kind of failure. Is evolving it in this proposed direction or any other going to succeed? I think this proposal is good. It helps the &quot;bouncing back and forth&quot; problem. One problem is that Microsoft has different security models for &quot;Modern&quot; and legacy apps. (Never mind what kind of sense it makes to have a stronger and weaker app security model in the same OS.)<p>Here is a potential irony: Ubuntu Touch is an evolutionary approach to bringing a conventional implementation of the desktop metaphor to touch.

If I interpreted him correctly, he&#x27;s claiming the assets don&#x27;t follow the power law, therefore transaction volume is much higher, because of course transaction speed &quot;money velocity&quot; must be constant because he didn&#x27;t consider it.<p>Evidence based on assets capped at a lower value than the power law implies probably implies either regulation is limiting asset size or otherwise distorting the market, OR the books are cooked and assets are considerably higher but accounting games are being played.  Perhaps thats a good idea for future financial planning if many of the &quot;hidden assets&quot; are actually worthless unrealized mortgage loan losses.  Or maybe they&#x27;re just crooks.<p>Anyway its a pretty big leap to go from unusually low assets to therefore total aggregate transaction volume must be artificially low.<p>For those who can&#x27;t tell the difference between assets and transaction volume, this is a slight simplification but the assets of the car lot at my car dealer are about 200 cars, varies a bit, but they&#x27;re all of probably about the same order.  Now the total transactional volume is totally different at each dealer, some sell one car per day and some sell ten cars per day.  The total annual transaction volume better closely match the total annual car production.  However the assets on hand merely equal a simple division problem and don&#x27;t mean a whole heck of a lot.  Its like comparing apples and oranges or OSes and DMBSes.

When Steve Jobs wrote his letter about Flash a big part of the deal was Flash&#x27;s impact on battery life because it was so inefficient -- and Adobe struggled to fix this for years and then gave up.<p>I remember back when some Adobe blogger published a comparison of Flash to canvas animations showing Flash to be significantly faster. I, and several others, posted trivially optimized versions of the canvas code that crushed Flash like a bug, and this was Flash at the end of a long period of optimization where it carefully draws only the regions of the screen that changed, versus a pretty naive canvas implementation pretty much double-buffering its animation.<p><a href=""http://loewald.com/blog/?p=3362"" rel=""nofollow"">http://loewald.com/blog/?p=3362</a>",1380722415

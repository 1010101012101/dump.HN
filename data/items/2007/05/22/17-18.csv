It launched in alpha version last week. <p>It's a site where academics can create an academic webpage, and upload their papers and research interests. You can see a sample webpage here: <a href=""http://oxford.academia.edu/RichardPrice"" rel=""nofollow"">http://oxford.academia.edu/RichardPrice</a><p>We have also built a paper-tracking engine that tracks the latest papers uploaded to the web in a given field. You can see the results for Computer Science here: <a href=""http://cs.academia.edu/categories/2/papers"" rel=""nofollow"">http://cs.academia.edu/categories/2/papers</a><p>Academia.edu's founder is Richard Price.

The biggest deals happening right now wouldn't even warrant a sidebar mention in the web 1.0 boom. Niche retail sites were getting $60m rounds, regularly. Companies with huge losses were going public with valuations over $1B. <p>Now Arrington is calling it a bubble because companies are getting $7m first rounds? Sure, there's a lot of hype and a lot of these companies will go nowhere, but from hype and exuberance grows innovation. \n",1179854566

The ""crisis"" is not reported anymore -- it's obvious.<p>Software is malleable, which is its power and curse.  He posits that ""Software is the most complicated stuff that humans make.""  Because software is malleable, there are no good metrics for software completeness or quality. In software, legacy is a pejorative term, it means ""the crap we did before we knew any better.""<p>-- The actually typing of code is only a few % of our time.  However, we <i>think</i> we spend our time typing.  Too much effort goes into optimizing this small percentage.  Think of IDEs with autocomplete.  [Though features that help you read code are probably worth it.]<p>One important concept in software development today is incremental development.  But also dangerous, you can build yourself into a corner.  Architecture is important.<p>Security oriented programming is good programming. Security requires code simplicity.\n",1179854467

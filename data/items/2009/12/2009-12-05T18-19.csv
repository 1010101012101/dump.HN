978371,comment,978124,978308,0,0,tel,,,"There are a ton of things to clarify, but I'll take a stab at it.<p>A proper Bayesian who is betting and doesn't want to lose badly and still ends up as a fan of the 'da Bears' has probably got a prior that gives some confident edge to them winning. Belief A could be stated using this joint distribution as the product of their predicted chances of winning each game in order. If it's actually 'likely' then that means you've got a pretty incredible edge on them winning (the size proportional to how much season is left).<p>Belief B is a weird one though. It's a meta-hypothesis about the calibration of your own personal beliefs. The evidence you use to update on this belief is the discrepancy between what you would honestly predict and what actually happened. A proper Bayesian with money on the line would want to recalibrate as best as they could using data already available in order to get the probability of B as low as possible before starting to look at A.<p>So our proper Bayesian first looks over old predictions he has about the Bear's performance, reworking whatever internal understanding of the factors that go into winning in football he has, until he is well calibrated. At this point, his probability for belief A has almost certainly dropped because it's a pretty unlikely thing for a team to just take a thing apart at every single game for the whole season, but if he still ends up with a strong prior on them winning then a single loss, even if it's pretty bad, won't shift it around a lot.<p>In short, he'll think about it a lot, cancel out whatever personal biases he can manage, then bet conservatively unless he has some sort of knowledge that provides a really, really strong edge on them winning. IMO, he's got an inside line with some dirty, dirty men.",1260038563

I am more interested in building a machine that is a tool that enhances human abilities.  For example, we used to keep track of our resources with pen and paper.  We have built machines that make that easier.  We used to walk to school, now we have cars and busses to drive us there.  We used to dream about flying, now it is routine.<p>The classic AI approach (speaking of Minsky and others there) seems to be aimed at replicating a human.<p>Conversation about consciousness strike me as ill-informed and are not of any interest to me.

978336,comment,978263,978263,0,0,pmjordan,,,"I'm biased - I generally prefer the Clojure way of doing things to CL (data structures, unicode, portability, library compatibility) but then the last time I seriously used CL was ~2006-2007, so things may have changed since.<p>But, to address your requirements:<p>* JSON: clojure.contrib.json<p>* XML: clojure.contrib.prxml<p>I gather there are a JS generator and an SQL interfacing library in contrib as well, though I haven't used them. Worst case you can access any Java libs for those purposes.<p>You also get to plug into any webserver that supports Java servlets, if that's an issue.<p>The killer feature for server programming in Clojure is the STM though. It means you can multi-thread your server relatively worry-free without resorting to moving all your state out-of-process (e.g. all state lives in the DB). You still need to pay attention to synchronising I/O, but compared to manual locking of <i>everything</i>, STM is a piece of cake.<p>(context on my perspective: I've delivered a Clojure-powered back-end server for a multiplayer Flash game for a customer, as well as made some minor short-lived web sites; clojure was great for all of those use cases - I'd link to them if I was allowed to put my name against them)",1260036802

I have done a lot of work in javascript, and my reason for html/js generation wasn't because I believe that everything should be lisp. I enjoy writing html, js and css from scratch.<p>The reason I chose it as one of my criterion is because it allows you to get off the ground _fast_ if you're coding in a single language (so basically it helps with prototyping stuff). I really enjoy the html generation libraries- I can test stuff without doing a mental switch between languages, even build a half decent UI very quickly, and that is a huge advantage. My initial scripts will not need to be run in multiple browsers, they'll be simple scripts to get the app going. Since I intend to keep the scripts small and smiple, I can replace them later with javascript as the app grows.",1260036783

Worse still, if each is using subjective techniques that they believe are objective, the unexamined assumption will lead to them talking past each other.<p>By contrast with correct reasoning you can show each why they continue to believe what they believe while showing them how the other side is not going to have their opinions changed.

The thing I've witnessed with newbies and SCM, is that they are so intimated by it they never get in the habit of using it(until they go to a good shop that uses it). But it takes 1 minutes to sign up for github. And 1 hour of typing ""git commit, git add, git init, git push"" etc to master the basics. Then building upon that knowledge is easy.

My work for the last 3-4 years has mostly been in Python and C++, and I have forgotten a lot of in's and out's of Java.<p>So, what is the best (and fast) way to get back in the groove with a language? Any suggestions on small projects that make you use (and hence revise) old languages that you know already?<p>A related question is, how do you guys stay in touch with technologies that you have learned but haven't had a chance to use in a long time?",1242129517

Perhaps I can work out an integer linear formulation that you can feed into a standard solver for linear optimization problems.<p>If you want to read papers on the subject, look for 'scheduling' or 'production planning'.  'Bin packing' and 'cutting stock' might also be related.<p>Do you need an online solution or do you know all demands in advance?  Also what do you do when not enough slots are available for all VMs?  That could happen either because the number of slots in demand is higher than the supply --- or a bit more subtle: Say you have n servers, and n+1 VMs each taking M/2+1 slots.  The total number of slots suffices, but still your VMs do not fit the machines.",1242129386

The main goal is to see if you can scale the algorithm, for which they're the real experts. The hash table discussion is a mere diversion. The ""expected"" progression of the particular discussion is: 1. hash table implementation (simplest map container) when you have enough RAM to see if the candidate gets cs basics. 2. sort | uniq -c when you have enough disks on a single node to see if the candidate has experience with non-trivial amount of data (larger than RAM.) and understanding of modern disk performance characteristics (random vs sequential I/O) 3. map-reduce on multiple nodes for the entire internet; see if the candiate has experience and understandings with distributed computing. So the author didn't make very far. His attitude and mindset were also getting in the way of interviewers' steering the interview. It's a classic case of impedance mismatch in interviews.",1242128812

If your whole operation is based upon the ""trust"" that I'm also going to view your ads - you've got another think coming.<p>Anyway, I see it from the opposite angle. It was websites abusing my trust - that I would be able to view their content without being subjected to inane, distracting ads - that led me to this attitude in the first place.

Punch the monkey. Win a PS3! Get your horoscope on your mobile! Repair your Windows registry! They are pure annoying noise. How can you possibly blame me for wanting to block them out?<p>I have nothing against site owners; hell, I'm a site owner myself.

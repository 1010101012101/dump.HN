Take for example the seemingly simple action of pouring a glass of water. This relies on knowing the glass has to be oriented the right way up, that liquid is subject to gravity, the general behaviour of liquids, viscosity and lots of little things that we take for granted.<p>For some good writing on the subject have look at Douglas B.

The stuff that becomes the most popular on social news sites tends to be highly masturbatory, and creating a mythology around the 'correct' locus is the all time #1 way of masturbatorifying content. That's why every popular movie ever starts out with the main character waking up and discovering that they're 'different' and they have some sort of destiny. And it's why HN articles alternate between portraying life like an XYZ quest versus articles like these.[1]<p>[1] Go to X, kill Y, take Z. Possibly attributable to Ralph Koster.",1307228324

2620667,comment,2620452,2620452,2,0,bediger,,,"Different levels of US public schools date from different periods, and have different purposes.  Grade school, grades 1-8: learn to read well enough to read the Bible, do simple sums so as to be able to do simple mechanical things on farms, and keep from getting ripped off by city-slicker store owners.<p>Kindergarten is a much later add on.  It's supposed to prepare children for grade school, I guess.<p>High school: prepare the bulk of the people to do factory work.  Why else would you have rigid ""shift work"" style classes?  Showing up on time is also heavily emphasized, so that graduates never question punching a time card.<p>The US higher education system pre-dates grade school and high school.  Harvard pre-dates the US Government.  Borrowed from the English, with German-style reasearch institutes (technical universities) tacked on top.<p>As far as history being all lies: I agree.  But very narrow-minded lies.  I believe that public schools as organized in the US educate to what standards the loudest complainers allow them to.  History (or ""Social Studies"" as it is called) ends up being some pious lies told to students to paper over the tragic mistakes and abuses of the past. Would you like to be reminded that within historical times, your ancestors committed a continent-scale genocide?",1307228246
2620666,comment,2619760,2619760,7,0,mikeleeorg,,,"I think the operative words in that article are, ""requiring passion."" And to that, I would add, ""work smarter, not harder.""<p>When I was in my early twenties, I lived in NYC and London. My motto was the typical, ""word hard, play hard."" I worked 12+ hour days fairly regularly. The work was interesting, the people were cool, and I was learning a lot. I remember leaving work one morning as people were coming in; their day was starting as my day was ending.<p>On the weekends (and sometimes weekdays), my friends and I would go bar-hopping, catch a movie, attend a festival, etc. While in London, we'd also take weekend excursions to another city or country. I also remember sky diving & bungee jumping trips.<p>Now that I'm in my thirties, I don't work as many hours, though my work output hasn't decreased. Instead, I like to think that I work smarter now, not harder. I still really enjoy my work - and oftentimes don't even feel like I'm ""working."" But if I spend too much time on something, instead of slogging through it, I'll stop and look for a more efficient solution. I've learned that time is too valuable for brute force.<p>On the surface, it may not seem like I'm working as much. I work anywhere from 8-12 hours a day now, but in aggregate, I get much more done. And none of those hours really feels like work.<p>I attribute this to having passion for what I do, and learning how to work smart.",1307228245

That aside I imagine that many physicists hold to a form of Anthropic Principle which almost fits the definition of ""just because"".<p>As an agnostic I always felt that God was the cop-out answer that replaced ""we don't know"". As a Christian not knowing everything still frustrates me but knowing now that within our current knowledge it is provable that not everything is knowable softens the blow of that somewhat (Godel, Church-Turing, etc.).<p>><i>religious thinking which offers conclusions in advance of, and regardless of, any empirical data</i><p>You suppose that religion is false to state your position, of course you do, but if you suspend your supposition then you see that religion 'offers truth in advance of reason'.<p>Christians generally, IME, don't say that God exists as the conclusion of a logical argument it's presuppositional in the same way as assumption of the validity of ones own sense data, or the assumption of ones actual self or of an external world.<p>Christians take that 'Christ died for our sins and was resurrected to heaven' and live by it and find that it works. Physicists take that 'c is constant for all observers' and live by it and find that it works. Obviously 'it works' means many different things both to the Christian and to the scientist (coherentism, instrumentalism, etc.).",1307227340

2620641,comment,2619417,2620002,1,0,nightski,,,"While I appreciate your experience, you basically are saying that it would be hellish because of two features.  Haskell and/or OCaml have many incredible benefits, and many of them do not rely on laziness to work.  Sure it allows you to write some incredibly elegant, generic solutions - but I don't think it is necessary to have it as the default.<p>I think things like the record system could be fixed up with simply more eyes on the problem.  Lets face it, the Haskell community and contributor base is relatively small.  If it had the resources of say C++ or Java behind it - a lot of these small problems could be tackled.<p>But when it comes down to it these are minor details, not fundamental flaws of the platform such as the ones discussed with Java.<p>Also I do program solely in Haskell during my free time (ok, maybe some matlab on the side haha).  While the learning curve has been incredibly intense - it is so damn rewarding that I keep coming back.  The solutions are incredibly generic, elegant, testable, and even quite fast with a little performance optimization work (with experience the amount of effort required for this tends to go way down as with anything).  I guess I would rather write the correct code first, and put a little time into optimization than write highly optimized incorrect code and spend a lot of time fixing bugs.<p>But far and away the largest problem that Haskell goes a long way towards solving is composability.  Many may argue this point but I really believe this is the largest challenge we face today in software.  So many issues boil down to this. The vast majority of bugs, re-writing, etc... comes from software that was not designed in a composable manner.  Because let's face it - with the current tools like Java/C++ it is incredibly hard!",1307227130

Spending on customer acquisition is building real barriers to entry.<p>I tend to agree with DHH that the barriers to entry will never be high enough in the daily deal area.  Also, as Groupon seeks to stay ahead of daily deal competitors, it cannibalizes its own business model  namely, the artificial scarcity and urgency of daily bargains reverts to more and more on-demand variety.  We see this already.<p>B.  Spending on direct sales is building a valuable collection of local merchants.<p>Others have built directories of local businesses before.  The Yellow Pages, Yahoo are examples.  Yelp, etc. are more modern examples.  Can Groupon unlock a profitable business model from their collection?<p>C.  Spending on marketing is building enough public goodwill to transcend value propositions altogether.<p>Groupon is a great brand name, so far.  Public goodwill is damn fickle, though.  I'd like to think that consumers require a real value proposition from their favorite brands, but I'm not sure that they always do.<p>When it comes to daily deals, I doubt consumers will chose Groupon over a better deal, just because of the Groupon name.",1307226984

Which means breaking prototypical inheritance with your mixins - they can't change, because anything set up by such copying won't get updated.<p>Specific quote my reasoning is based on: <i>... changes to the mixin affect objects that have already been extended.</i><p>edit: well... you <i>could</i>.  By making mixin objects that propagate changes to themselves to instances of things which include them - pass each instance to the mixin, and keep a list.

Many community standards (such as nice) are nebulous and have vastly differing thresholds and signaling methods, and this is not something that can be easily resolved up-front.  Applying subterfuge early in the process makes it possible for a well-meaning entrant to randomly lose by misinterpreting things early on, then being denied feedback that would allow them to make a more informed decision about their behavior.  They are further punished by throwing their participatory resources into an invisible hole while thinking all is well.  This is easily nontrivial collateral damage, depending on the set of visitors.",1307225699

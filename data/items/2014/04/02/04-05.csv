Their services go from &#x27;free&#x27; (as in Charles Schwab will send you a copy of their research department&#x27;s report on a company or a segment if you&#x27;re an account holder) to &#x27;extortionate&#x27; which some of the larger trading houses keep in their back pockets to help them pick winners and losers.<p>As a collection point for this information about <i>privately</i> held companies, it puts you in a nearly unassailable position to do research on which of these companies are likely to be successful or not (your own sort of buy/hold/sell ratings) This isn&#x27;t even possible today because, as the article mentions. everyone goes to different places to get their 409A valuations. So no single entity has enough of the puzzle to assemble a recognizable picture, yet by offering this valuation service, and attracting a very large number of customers, you create the opportunity to be that single source of information.<p>I would venture a guess that there are venture capitalists that would pay handsomely for a &#x27;peek&#x27; at the state of the industry &#x27;yet to come&#x27; as it were.

My main problem with it is that editing is incredibly fussy.<p>What I prefer mostly is GraphViz[3], which is not <i>just</i> a mind-mapping tool, but can be used as such.  The advantage here is that what you&#x27;re editing is a simple text file, with graphic output created by running one of the graphviz commands over it (dot, neato, twopi, circo, fdp, sfdp).  For a traditional mind map, the &#x27;circo&#x27; command is probably what you&#x27;re looking for.  While not as interactive as other methods, if you&#x27;re working on a complex space, the lack of constant overhead for graphical presentation is a plus, as is the simplicity of the base language.  What I&#x27;m still looking to do is to write a simple outline -> GraphViz converter which sets up edges based on indent levels and parent, which would further simplify the input problem.<p>________________________________<p>Notes:<p>1. <a href=""http://text2mindmap.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://text2mindmap.com/</a><p>2. <a href=""https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Freemind"" rel=""nofollow"">https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Freemind</a><p>3. <a href=""http://graphviz.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://graphviz.org/</a>",1396414184

IMO any political philosophy that says things &quot;must go this way&quot; or that somehow their ideas are handed down from a higher power is harmful (i.e. authoritarianism). It&#x27;s not about trying to promote inequality either, and using the free market or something as an excuse, it&#x27;s about promoting criticism and transparency. And I truly believe political philosophies like Marxism are against critical thinking and anti-science. Most people who espouse some kind of Marxist beliefs have never bothered reading any Popper which is quite telling to me.<p>inb4 &quot;but that sounds like libertarianism which everyone knows only rich bigoted fedora wearing assholes like!&quot;<p>[1] <a href=""https://archive.org/details/opensocietyandit033120mbp"" rel=""nofollow"">https://archive.org/details/opensocietyandit033120mbp</a>",1396413216

When you break all of that stuff down, you&#x27;re left facing questions like &quot;how can I design a protocol so that over a lossy channel I can unambiguously ascertain the correct transmission and reception of a given piece of information?&quot; The natural unit which falls out of this is the indivisible bit, zero or one, the presence or absence of a signal, over a certain measured interval of time.<p>The theoreticians and engineers who produced the first systems for digital data transmission were all informed by this work, and their fundamental challenge was to produce systems capable of reliable transmission and reception of streams of bits -- not necessarily 8-bit bytes, that being a higher-order concern left to higher-order devices in the network, for sake of modularity. (For a bewildering example as to why telecom techs wanted^H^H^H^H^H^Hstill want to leave this kind of thing to others to puzzle out, see, e.g. <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/36-bit"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/36-bit</a>)<p>As a result, today, network engineers pay first attention to the bit-rate rather than the byte-rate capabilities of their equipment, and this is reflected in everything from the names of low-level protocols to ways of talking about circuits to the specifications of concrete product implementations, both in terms of the data-carrying capacities of network interfaces to the speeds offered to consumers.<p>I come from the network engineering world, as you might have guessed :) So, on the opposite side of your question, I find it terribly distressing when software like my Bittorrent client reports speeds to me in megabytes-per-second. I don&#x27;t have an intuitive <i>feel</i> for what a megabyte per second is, but I can take that figure and multiply by eight and say &quot;aha!&quot; Roughly the same as old-school 10Mbps Ethernet.",1396411825

If not here it is on Pastebin - <a href=""http://pastebin.com/MspKq8sz"" rel=""nofollow"">http://pastebin.com/MspKq8sz</a>.<p>Here is what I recommend for website security (this is a lot of advice and is not perfect - if you want me to write this up in a detailed blog post and cover more things let me know)... I also provided my contact information at the bottom if you have any questions or need any help settings this up.<p>Domain Registrar:<p>1. Melbourne IT - <a href=""https://www.melbourneit.com.au/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.melbourneit.com.au/</a>\n2. Namecheap - <a href=""https://www.namecheap.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.namecheap.com/</a>\n3. Gandi - <a href=""https://www.gandi.net/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.gandi.net/</a><p>- Enable WHOIS protection\n- Enable domain locking - if you want more details on how to set this up let me know\n- Enable email notifications and make sure you keep your account information up to date\n- Log in from a computer using a VPN (I use and recommend proXPN - <a href=""https://proxpn.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://proxpn.com/</a>) which encrypts your connection<p>DNS<p>1. Any of the domain registrars mentioned above\n2. CloudFlare - <a href=""https://www.cloudflare.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.cloudflare.com/</a> (offers performance benefits as well) Their DDOS protection, DNS, and performance benefits are why I use and recommend them.  They are not very good in terms of their WAF or website security and that is why I use and recommend Sucuri as well.\n3. DNS Made Easy - <a href=""http://www.dnsmadeeasy.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.dnsmadeeasy.com/</a><p>- Follow advice from passwords section\n- Delete unnecessary DNS records\n- Enable DNSSEC if possible<p>Email Hosting<p>1. I recommend that you use Google Apps for Business - <a href=""https://www.google.com/enterprise/apps/business/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.google.com/enterprise/apps/business/</a>.<p>- Follow advice from passwords section\n- Take advantage of the security Google offers<p>Passwords<p>1. Create strong passwords using a password generator.  I use GRC&#x27;s Password Generator by Steve Gibson. - <a href=""https://www.grc.com/passwords.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.grc.com/passwords.htm</a>\n2. Store your passwords in a password manager such as LastPass. - <a href=""https://lastpass.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://lastpass.com/</a>\n3. With LastPass use a strong master password, limit login attempts to your country and the ones you travel to frequently, use two factor authentication, don&#x27;t use a password reminder, don&#x27;t write down your master password - only memorize it and don&#x27;t ever share it, change your master password at least slightly every 3 months, and disable logins from the TOR network.\n4. Use the same password only once (Don&#x27;t use the same password on multiple sites).\n5. Don&#x27;t store your passwords in the browser or save them, so you are automatically logged in.\n6. Make sure your password is at least 15+ characters (I use 50+ characters) and it contains lowercase letters, uppercase letters, numbers, and special characters.\n7. If a site requires a secret question, make sure the answer to that question no one else would know or make it a password or phrase that you would remember.\n8. Use the browser add-on HTTPS Everywhere and use Mozilla Firefox or Google Chrome as your browser.\n9. Try to not share your passwords - I would like to say never share your passwords, but I know that is not possible :).  If you have to share your passwords, do so using LastPass, change the password after they are done, make sure they haven&#x27;t done anything that looks malicious, have a clear plan of what they need to do, and ask them how long it will take them.<p>Website Security<p>1. Backup your site - I recommend and use Sucuri Backups - <a href=""http://sucuri.net/services/website-backups"" rel=""nofollow"">http://sucuri.net/services/website-backups</a> (it is $5 a month per website)\n2. Use monitoring, alerting, and a removal service - I recommend and use Sucuri - <a href=""http://sucuri.net/signup"" rel=""nofollow"">http://sucuri.net/signup</a><p>It is $89.99 per year for one website.  The service includes 3 main areas which are monitoring (<a href=""http://sucuri.net/services/website-scan-malware-detection"" rel=""nofollow"">http://sucuri.net/services/website-scan-malware-detection</a>), alerting (<a href=""http://sucuri.net/services/alerting"" rel=""nofollow"">http://sucuri.net/services/alerting</a>), and removal (<a href=""http://sucuri.net/services/malware-removal"" rel=""nofollow"">http://sucuri.net/services/malware-removal</a>).  You can use any of those links for further details.<p>3. Use a WAF - I recommend and use Sucuri CloudProxy - <a href=""http://cloudproxy.sucuri.net/signup"" rel=""nofollow"">http://cloudproxy.sucuri.net/signup</a> ($9.99 a month for the most basic plan - the two other plans are $19.98 and $69.93 per month)<p>4. There could be a lot more in this area, but that should do a pretty good job for you.  If you are using a CMS such as WordPress, Joomla, or Drupal you have quite a bit more you can do in this area.<p>Hosting<p>1. It honestly depends on your needs, so I am not going to recommend anyone specifically.  If you want help with this or anything you can find my contact information at the bottom.<p>Network Security<p>1. Use WPA2 for the encryption protocol\n2. Make your network name random\n3. Make your password to connect to your network very strong\n4. Change the default login credentials to login to your network to a secure username and password.\n5. Disable Wi-Fi Protected Setup (WPS)\n6. Configure OpenDNS at the router level - <a href=""http://www.opendns.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.opendns.com/</a>\n7. Follow the passwords section for your passwords<p>Computer Security<p>1. Use a antivirus program (Antivirus for Mac by Sophos for MAC computers and Microsoft Security Essentials or Avast for Windows)\n2. Use an anti-malware program (Malwarebytes Antimalware and Malwarebytes Anti-Exploit for Windows)\n3. Use a firewall (Windows Firewall or TinyWall for Windows)\n4. Keep your operating system updated\n5. Keep your programs updated (Secunia PSI or FileHippo Update Checker for Windows and AppFresh for MAC)\n6. Remove Java and Quicktime if you don&#x27;t need them\n7. Replace Adobe Reader with Foxit Reader or Sumatra PDF\n8. Make sure you keep Adobe Flash Player up to date\n9. Uninstall programs that you don&#x27;t need or don&#x27;t use\n10. Only download things from trusted sources (the browser extension Web of Trust would help with this)\n11. For your browser make sure you are using Google Chrome or Mozilla Firefox.  For Google Chrome and Mozilla Firefox, I recommend that you use Adblock Plus, Disconnect, and HTTPS Everywhere).  If you want to be very secure and are somewhat technical, I recommend that you also use NoScript for Mozilla Firefox and NotScripts for Google Chrome.<p>If you have any questions you can email me at caleb.lane4(at)gmail.com.",1396411637

7513499,comment,7511762,7512883,6,0,anonymoushn,,,"Great :)<p>> From this comment it sounds along the lines of classic &quot;man marries his maid&quot; macro critiques.<p>I&#x27;m actually not very well versed in this area, so I had to look this up. You&#x27;re correct, the basic mechanism of the critique is identical.<p>There have been a lot of scathing critiques of your position, so I&#x27;ll try not to repeat them, especially since I basically agree.<p>I&#x27;ll put more thought into this, but coming up with a numerical justification for favoring one policy over another, without real-world data, seems <i>really hard</i>. If you take out the transfer-payment-like portion of both policies (nearly all of Basic Income and most of Basic Job), you can see that Basic Job has purchased something (jobs that need doing, but wouldn&#x27;t pay well) and Basic Income has not. At this point, Basic Job has done pretty well.<p>The disincentive to work when receiving a stipend that is sufficient to live on is definitely real. However, it&#x27;s a bit hard to address the benefits associated with increased physical mobility and entrepreneurship under BI. Apparently some studies observe a decrease in economic activity upon the introduction of BI and others observe a decrease[0]. (Interestingly, some of the situations described are shades of &quot;man marries his maid&quot;, like the mothers who stop working to take raise their children).<p>The important thing to me is that I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s much use in comparing the balance-transfer-like parts of the programs. We should compare the outcomes, because the fact that one program taxes and pays a stipend to everyone who already has a job and the other does not isn&#x27;t a huge difference on net. I was a bit too snarky in the past, but this is the portion of the policy that is NOPTransferPayment-like. I&#x27;ll go a bit further and claim that programs which arbitrarily redistribute income don&#x27;t have a big economic effect; Social Security for instance does not greatly increase or greatly decrease the level of economic activity (assuming that it just pipes a fixed amount of income from young people to old people, which it doesn&#x27;t, but anyway...).<p>* ahem *<p>Now that I&#x27;ve gotten myself to write this all down, I realize that my objection is actually compatible with your model, and I&#x27;ve just made the error of thinking otherwise because the dominant factors in your analysis were the ones I wish to disregard. I have installed the required packages, made some tweaks, and run your simulation. If we do not count money taxed and handed right back to citizens as a cost, the difference is small enough that reasonable people could disagree about which program to prefer:<p><a href=""http://pastie.org/8987586#"" rel=""nofollow"">http://pastie.org/8987586#</a><p><a href=""http://i.imgur.com/UeWTSko.png"" rel=""nofollow"">http://i.imgur.com/UeWTSko.png</a><p>This quick and dirty run is biased in favor of BI - we&#x27;ve accounted for the disincentive to work at all due to BI, but not for whatever disincentive to economic activity introduced by setting taxes higher than under BJ. This wasn&#x27;t a problem in the original analysis because it regarded the whole taxed amount as a cost. This factor should be some fraction of the difference of the amounts of tax between the two programs, but it is not clear what fraction. In fact, I&#x27;ve found a source that seems to indicate it should be a fraction greater than 1, in which case my whole objection could just make BJ win by an even larger margin.<p>Perhaps I should not say this, because I have not modeled it... Here we go anyway: It seems very likely to me that both of these systems are better than our current system of somewhat excessive overhead and near-100% marginal tax rates for the non-working poor.<p>[0]: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_income#Disincentive_to_work"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_income#Disincentive_to_wo...</a>",1396411440

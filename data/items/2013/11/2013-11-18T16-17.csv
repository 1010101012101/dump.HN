6755264,comment,6751710,6751710,3,0,joemi,,,"I work for a book store that sells roughly 40,000 items on Amazon (some but not all of those via FBA), and since I&#x27;ve been in charge of the Amazon sales, I&#x27;ve had our account &quot;permanently&quot; shut down several times. Each time, I&#x27;ve written an appeal that gets our account reinstated in just a week, and I can tell you that, based on this article, the seller did not write the correct kind of appeal.<p>When you&#x27;re kicked off, Amazon very clearly says (I&#x27;m paraphrasing) &quot;If you appeal, explain why this happened and how you&#x27;re going to prevent it from happening again&quot;. At this point, your only option (if you want to continue selling on Amazon) is to suck up your pride and do exactly that. You can not argue against their decision. You have to tell them you messed up and tell them you&#x27;re going to fix it, whether or not you messed up and whether or not you&#x27;re actually going to change anything. It&#x27;s essentially that simple. Just try to make your &quot;changes&quot; sound as bullet proof as possible, and if possible, mention that you&#x27;ve already implemented them.<p>I am by no means excusing Amazon, mind you. I completely sympathize with the OP, and dealing with Amazon in any way is the worst kind of bureaucratic BS I&#x27;ve ever dealt with. (It once took me over 6 months to get the title of a book corrected, and during that entire time I had the book in my possession and sent Amazon copious pictures of it with the corrected title.) The only reason I knew how to write successful appeals was because another seller once told me. Otherwise, I would have done exactly the same thing, and suffered exactly the same problems.<p>edit: I should add that it seems as though all correspondence with Amazon is handled by very very low level employees, and there always seems to be a checklist or script they&#x27;re always working off of. Unless you hit certain points on their presumed checklists in your emails (including your appeals), nothing gets done at all.",1384793844

6755253,comment,6754886,6754886,10,0,gabemart,,,"I&#x27;d be cautious of using number of submissions as a metric for growth. It&#x27;s possible that at least some of the growth in the number of submissions is caused by an increase in the ratio of spam.<p>In fact, a growing number of submissions can be a problem for a social news aggregator. Is it fair to assume that curation capacity will scale linearly with submission quantity? Perhaps not. Even if a linear growth in submissions represents a scaled growth in visitors and user accounts, curation capacity will only scale if new user accounts have the same curation appetite as older user accounts.<p>If you get lots of new submissions and lots of new visitors but a smaller number of new people voting on submissions, average quality of front-page material will suffer. It&#x27;s possible there will be a positive feedback effect if older users with a higher appetite for curating content are more sensitive to a decline in quality and thus more likely to leave the site, exacerbating the problem.<p>When a social news site is young and small, (non-spam) submissions are a Good Thing. But as a user-driven site matures, it&#x27;s much more valuable to have better submissions rather than more submissions.<p>I hypothesize that one solution to the seemingly inevitable decline in quality of large social sharing sites is to introduce a cost to posting new content. A trivial example would be scaling the minimum time between submissions to the user&#x27;s karma  for previous submissions. (For this to work without incentivizing spam via sock puppets, there would have to be heavy restrictions on posting content for new users.) The time-between-submissions could be large for less proven accounts - think days rather than minutes.<p>There are problems with this approach, but they may be better problems to have than the alternative.",1384793774

WinRT suffers from the same limitations as iOS and Android when it comes to servicing business&#x27; needs. The good news is that WFP is going to be supported and improved upon (despite what the author says) until WinRT is a viable alternative.<p>In the future I can see a small business owner linking all his computers together with a master Microsoft account and then buying a POS app that&#x27;s downloaded to all of his computers linked under that account.

We hardened the hash by mixing in the length of the key into the seed.<p>This prevents making an infinite set of keys that collide, yes, but does not fix the problem completely. It only increases the request size required to perform the attack.

6755229,comment,6753945,6754913,12,0,aliakbarkhan,,,"I think you&#x27;re too quick to dismiss the possibility. The point of parallel construction is that the police construct a plausible (and, more importantly, legal) means of finding the evidence that they used in an investigation that masks its true, illegal origin. More importantly, unlike false flags -- where the only &quot;evidence&quot; for their use is the ravings of conspiracy theorists and some internal suggestions by government officials in the 60&#x27;s -- parallel construction is a technique that we know the government uses by their own admission.<p>From Reuters (<a href=""http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/08/05/us-dea-sod-idUSBRE97409R20130805"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/08/05/us-dea-sod-idUSBRE...</a>):<p>> The undated documents show that federal agents are trained to &quot;recreate&quot; the investigative trail to effectively cover up where the information originated, a practice that some experts say violates a defendant&#x27;s Constitutional right to a fair trial. [...]<p>> After an arrest was made, agents then pretended that their investigation began with the traffic stop, not with the SOD tip, the former agent said. The training document reviewed by Reuters refers to this process as &quot;parallel construction.&quot;<p>> The two senior DEA officials, who spoke on behalf of the agency but only on condition of anonymity, said the process is kept secret to protect sources and investigative methods. &quot;Parallel construction is a law enforcement technique we use every day,&quot; one official said. &quot;It&#x27;s decades old, a bedrock concept.&quot;<p>> A dozen current or former federal agents interviewed by Reuters confirmed they had used parallel construction during their careers. Most defended the practice; some said they understood why those outside law enforcement might be concerned.<p>> &quot;It&#x27;s just like laundering money - you work it backwards to make it clean,&quot; said Finn Selander, a DEA agent from 1991 to 2008 and now a member of a group called Law Enforcement Against Prohibition, which advocates legalizing and regulating narcotics.<p>Given how they talk about parallel construction, it certainly sounds like it&#x27;s not an uncommon technique, so do you think it&#x27;s so implausible? I&#x27;m not going to say they did or didn&#x27;t use it, because the simple fact is that I don&#x27;t know, but given that &quot;Parallel construction is a law enforcement technique we use every day&quot; that is &quot;decades old, a bedrock concept,&quot; it doesn&#x27;t seem too implausible that they would use it in such a high profile and important case.",1384793553

It is valuable to consumers because of its easy divisibility (it is far more divisible than gold) and the ability to spend it quickly and anonymously.<p>Think of the BitCoin network as a financial superconductor - the resistance to movement is so small that its negligible.

I&#x27;m 15 years old, attend high school, do well in terms of grades and extracurriculars (business clubs/competitions), and also am a pretty good front-end developer experienced with HTML/Jade,CSS/LESS, JS/jQuery/AngularJS, and Phonegap/Cordova. I&#x27;ve worked on several web projects in the past, such as http://teen2geek.com, and my portfolio is at http://krrishd.github.io, just to get an idea of what I can do in web development (not so good at the backend though).<p>I recently took part in a social entrepreneurship competition to prevent suicide, and I envisioned a specific app, and the idea won a grant. This app is somewhat similar to some social networks you&#x27;ve seen, and is a bit complex to develop for a front-end guy like me.

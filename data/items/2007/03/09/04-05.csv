3062,comment,2987,3020,0,0,dfranke,,,"There is no absolute Right supply of either fiat money or karma.  If every dollar bill in everyone's wallet magically turned into two, the price of everything would double and nobody would be materially affected.  Similarly, doubling everyone's karma and causing the up arrow to give two points rather than one would have no material effect.<p>Inflation matters when you factor in time.  Inflation encourages risk.  It makes your current savings become less valuable in the future, encouraging you to try to increase your wealth to compensate.  Too much inflation encourages too much risk, and you get a bubble.<p>Money is valuable because it can be exchanged for scarce resources.  Karma is valuable because it gets you attention, which is a scarce resource.  There are two kinds of attention: visibility of articles and visibility on the leader board.  Karma is the cause of the latter, but only a byproduct of the former.  There are a fixed number of articles on the front page and a fixed number of spots on the leader board, but both become more valuable as the community grows, because more eyeballs means more attention.<p>At this point, the money analogy breaks down.  Money is both a unit of accounting and a medium of exchange.  Karma is only a unit of accounting.  It tells us how wealthy we are, but we can't exchange it for other wealth.  Attention doesn't behave like a commodity either.  If we give and receive the same amount of attention, that's not the same as simply doing nothing.<p>So, news.yc really doesn't behave anything like a conventional economy.  If any analogy can be drawn at all, I'd say that we're in a state of deflation.  As long as the community continues to grow, producing articles now is less profitable than producing articles later.",1173415654

3056,comment,2841,2841,0,0,aseemb,,,"I understand most of these points completely. The problem I am having is finding the RIGHT cofounder. I have run with my idea for about 18 months now, and I am now just starting to get serious about it from a business stand point. Now I am frantically looking for cofounders to join me but everybody seems like they are missing a key component. A lot of people are ""stoked"" about the idea and thought of starting their own company and are great to bounce ideas off of, but when it comes down to it they just dont do the work. I dont want to settle just to find a cofounder quickly, but I also feel like investors wont take me as seriously unless I have a founding team.<p>What do you think? <p>",1173414726

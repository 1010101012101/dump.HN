I'd have thought good unit test coverage and web interface testing, e.g. twill, benefit fast site development, especially with today's dynamic languages like Python.  <a href=""http://twill.idyll.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://twill.idyll.org/</a>",1182770924

In 2002 a guy called Andrei Broder, who now happens to be Vice President of Emerging Search Technology for Yahoo!, published a paper titled ""The Taxonomy of Web Search"". Broder analysed clickthrough logs (think of AOL) and came up with a taxonomy to classify what people search for in the Web. He identified three types of queries: Informational (people search for a specific piece of information: Who is Snoopy?), Navigational (people know where they want to go, a specific homepage or web site: Snoopy creator homepage), and Transactional (people search for a site to perform some kind of transaction: Buy Snoopy Case Mod). Long story. However what is remarkable: He and several others after him found that less than 50 percent of all Web queries are informational. Powersets search engine clearly seems to target informational queries. In order to lure users away from Google, Yahoo, and maybe Answers.com they have to offer a significantly better experience. That's hard. But they might do it, and kill Answers.com by doing so. However in order to be good at Navigational and Transactional queries (and that's where the money is) you don't need sophisticated Natural Language Modelling. Those queries are short for a reason. Users have a target in mind and want to go there as quick as possible. And in order to not dissapoint users there, you have to crawl as much of the web as you can. And then build a system that is still able to deliever queries at least as fast as google. And that's really really really hard, and probably the reason we haven't seen a Google killer so far. Hail to Powerset - the Answers.com killer.   ",1182770155

30491,comment,30246,30282,0,0,staunch,,,"One reason they may not satisfy a user's needs is simply because they're converged. No one wants a cellphone/coffee mug or a pocket knife/baseball, no matter how ""well"" converged. One reason the iPod was so great was precisely because it did one thing. I do agree with the author that convergence is the biggest risk, I just think Jobs can handle it. He's hyper aware of these issues.

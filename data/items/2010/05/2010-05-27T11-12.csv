Some apps have half their settings in a ""main menu"" which is activated by touch and hang the rest of the ""menu"" button. Some apps put everything in ""menu"". Others have multiple ""menu""s depending on where you are -- K-9 mail is a good example of this, where ""menu"" is context-sensitive, and preferences (for example) are distributed across three different displays. This is only intuitive once you grok the app layout. Others do horrible things such as putting menu items labelled ""more"" in their menus.<p>With the ""back"" button, there is no guarantee that pressing ""back"" will take you back. Sometimes it takes you to what you were previous doing, browser-style. Sometimes it takes you to an application's main screen. Sometimes it takes you to the home screen. It depends (I guess) on how the app author has organised the Activities in her app.<p>Really, the only consistent button on Android phones is the iPhone-like ""Home"" button.",1274959918

After those two years, native English speakers frequently wouldn't believe that I was from Germany and that I didn't grow up speaking English.<p>My take on becoming good at speaking a foreign language: You must make an effort, it will not come to you passively. You must be willing to ""forget"" what you already know. Listen to yourself. Ask other people to help and/or correct you. Try to learn like a child. Play with the language. Be curious.<p>(On another note, I also realized that not having an accent got me into fewer conversations since people would not bother asking me where I was from.)",1274958255

I have a very large personal web project that I will be developing over the next 6 months. This project is much bigger then anything I've ever done before, and I am really struggling at the moment. 
I want to plan and organise my project in a efficient and logical way so when I hire/fire coders others, and myself can understand everything that is to be done. 
Usually I just jot things down in a notebook, or write a to-do list for the smaller projects.<p>I am thinking of using a brainstorming application to help me with this, have each feature of the site on its own branch and then branch off of that with its comments/solutions. Could you suggest any good applications for helping me with this? Or is there a better way to plan ideas/solutions?<p>I also need to start looking at svn/cvs repositories as I have never used one before to manage revision control of a project. What is the best way to start with this? I have done a little research into subversion and git, but really I am clueless as to which I should learn/use.<p>The last thing I need is bug tracking, I usually just write down bugs I find in my applications in my notebook and fix them as and when. But seeing how large this project is, and the use of multiple programmers. I want to keep everything in one place, so we have an up to date list of bugs and a history of old bugs, should they give us trouble at a later date. What can you suggest for me?<p>I don't know if I have asked the right kind of questions here but I have a million things running through my head at the moment that I just want to manage and develop this project in a correct and professional way. 
If you have any suggestions on the planning, and management of a large web project could you please share them with me?<p>Thank you very much for your time and I hope you have a wonderful day!",1274958101

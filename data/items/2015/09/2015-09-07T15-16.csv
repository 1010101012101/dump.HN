It would be easy for a client to hire me to increase their followers and for me to do so with the thousands of fake accounts. Instead I choose to provide a true follower increase, meaning people that actually value their product. In most cases business owners and managers are appreciative to this approach. It is better to have 50 followers who engage with your product/service, than to have 1000 followers who do not.<p>Somewhat related, but my follower count stays about the same on average. I go through spurts where I post a lot and then don&#x27;t post at all. I don&#x27;t use Twitter that often for direct engagement with individuals, but do from time to time. About a month ago I woke up one day with over a thousand new followers. I thought for a second I had tweeted out something great the night before and was curious what it was that drew so many new eyes. A quick glance at my followers though revealed that ever last one of the new followers was a spam account. To me this devalues the entire ecosystem at Twitter. Twitter has this hard limit on following 2000 people until you reach some undisclosed threshold of followers (presumably close to 2000 followers). I believe that many of the spam accounts are created solely for the purpose of following people to bypass that arbitrary limit. To me though, Twitter has it completely wrong here. It would seem they are encouraging spam accounts by having this limit in place in the first place. There are better ways to detect spam accounts than saying if a user is following >2000 people yet doesn&#x27;t have 2000 followers they must be spam. Twitter can tell if a user interacts with the systems and tweets on a fairly regular basis. This to me is a better determination of whether an account is spam than simply the number of followers an account has.",1441641573

10181893,comment,10181556,10181556,0,0,rollback,,,"Commentary about the silliness of the avalanche of IOT devices being created right now aside (99% of consumer internet startups are based on dumb ideas and fail, but that doesn&#x27;t mean there is no market or trend!), it&#x27;s inevitable that this stuff is going to get traction in the market and it&#x27;s a vast market. I doubt it&#x27;s going to happen based on a bunch of edge-case $99 devices though.<p>The big trend here is the cost of wifi enabled microprocessors dropping down to nearly nothing. Last year we were excited about raspberry pi dropping prices down to $30 for sensor-enabled hardware on the network.<p>This year you can buy a wifi-enabled microcontroller for _$3_ (search esp8266). And that&#x27;s not even in volume. At that price, pretty much anything consumer electronics companies build can be addressable on the network.<p>Add to that voice control, which is crude but usable and built into every phone already and improving quickly. The idea of walking into your house and looking for a light switch is going to feel like walking up to your TV to change the channel did 30 years ago when the remote went into wider use.<p>I find the economic arguments about not saving money using IOT devices a little amusing, on HN especially.

SSHProxy doesn&#x27;t have anything to do with sshmux.<p>SSHProxy is a two part thing:<p>1. A server that, when connected to, will ssh to the requested host, but authenticate with a local private key.<p>2. A client that will, when connected to the server, work like netcat for ProxyCommand purposes.<p>I&#x27;m skipping some info about additional SSH sessions being involved, as they don&#x27;t provide any additional security.<p>The result is essentially ProxyCommand=&quot;ssh -W %h:%p jump_host&quot;, but instead of you having the private key, the jump_host has it. You then use a different private key to authenticate to the jump host.<p>I get the idea, and I by no means say he shouldn&#x27;t have implemented it, but this provides no additional security what so ever. It just moves your private key from one machine to another. I hope he had fun implementing it, though!

Certainly the tabbed interface at the bottom with a &quot;More&quot; button works, but it doesn&#x27;t work for every case.<p>So sure, you will have some projects where you have to go with what is known, but try some other projects to challenge a different approach out of you to build up your chops.",1441641073

The more they control the UI, the easier it is to nudge people in particular directions that shape good user experiences.<p>But that&#x27;s a small thing next to making money. To experiment with various ad products, they need extremely fine grained control of and reporting on user experience, and they need to be able to rapidly change that as they come up with new ideas.

To me, it looks like it has been reduced to either none or keyboard-interactive (password) login, which is considered bad practice. I could very easily implement support for this in sshmux, providing the setup you seem to use, as a way to avoid agent forwarding, but I just genuinely did not expect anyone to use password authentication, apart from in default config scenarios, before a public key has been installed.<p>Agent forwarding does not provide private keys, but only individual signing requests. This means that while the user is connected, and evil remote can request arbitrary signing, but only as long as the user is connected, and only as long as the users ssh agent is willing to do so. Using ssh-add -c further means that the user will have to accept each signing request. Also note that ssh -W, which is immune to any of these concerns, is fully supported by sshmux.<p>Correct me if I&#x27;m wrong, but &quot;Jailkit&quot; does not seem to stop an evil legitimate user from poking around other hosts with forwarding and such (which they can as long as ssh -W functions, within the limits of what a firewall allows the jump host to do in general). sshmux allows you to lock users to targets, rather than lock general capabilities of the entire jump host.

Period. And rural areas require the same, for a completely different reason. Besides, I would consider a self-driving car a vehicle. As opposed to say public transit, bikes, segways, walking, or telepresence/phones.<p>I think you might have missed the point I was driving at. I&#x27;m not a gear head or car lover. I&#x27;ve never considered a car as something that impacted my status. And my cars have all been &quot;commodity type&quot; cars, that is, until I made memories with them, which would not have been possible without them.<p>There are already services which rent cars with unlimited miles and unlimited routes. Budget Rent-A-Car. But again, that is a vehicle. I&#x27;ve also bussed across the country and taken the train up the coast of Australia. Not the same thing. A road trip is not a road trip, blanket statement, if it does not allow for deviations in route and schedule, for any reason, or no reason whatsoever.<p>Before the arrival of Tesla, I would have said personal vehicles (self driving or not) were on their way out. But with advances in renewable energy, recyclable/ sustainable materials, and software which allows vehicles to either go their own way on dirt roads or coordinate enormous numbers of distinct vehicles in one super-efficient flow on shared, optimized infrastructure, it&#x27;s my humble opinion that the personal vehicle has gained a second lease on life. Again, to me it simply boils down to the fact that there are too many pockets of awesome in this world. You can&#x27;t build public infrastructure which makes them all accessible. That wouldn&#x27;t make sense economically or ecologically. Philosophically it doesn&#x27;t even make sense in many scenarios. It might be a pocket of awesome for the very reason that there are no convenient roads to it. And, no matter how many people we can squeeze into concrete jungles, there will always be a human desire to venture out, onto the road. As long as humans maintain their human nature, there will, in short, always be a human need for the personal vehicle to fulfill. And, by the nature of the need being fulfilled, that relationship between person and vehicle will not be mundane. Q.E.D.",1441640009

I was always interested in the topic, and had indeed read a book when I was teenager, with ideas such as the iconic example of Clinton touching his nose.<p>About 5 years ago I went to the topic again; learned that one of the biggest authority in the topic was Paul Ekman and read a couple of his books<p>Surprise surprise, the main takeaways were ideas such as:<p><i>(...) not to jump to early conclusions: just because someone looks nervous, or struggles to remember a crucial detail, does not mean they are guilty.

I have 1 big network where a set of users are only allowed to jump to 1 or more unique host each, with myself and a few others being able to jump to every single one. I believe that your solution requires things to be on different subnets to isolate them, with separate jump hosts for each subnet, correct? Here, I only need one sshmux for everyone.<p>Another &quot;fun&quot; feature is that sshmux can also throw unknown users to a separate host, such as ssh-chat, for support or hanging out.<p>Actually, in case of -oProxyCommand=&quot;ssh -W %h:%p jump_host&quot;, you&#x27;re still fully secure in the case that the jump host (sorry for not calling it a jumpbox) is compromised. This is true both for normal SSH servers and for sshmux. They can mess with the original raw ssh connection that requests the forward, but this will just screw the connection up. They can connect it to a wrong host, but that will provide incorrect host keys. The agent isn&#x27;t forwarded, so they don&#x27;t get to sign anything with the private key. Messing with the new connection that gets established is subject to SSH&#x27;s normal MITM resistance. This means that even root on the jump host would require real SSH protocol vulnerabilities to attack the connection.<p>Good luck with Userify!",1441639033

This is starting to change in theory but up until now, the norm has been for a person to finish a 2-year contract, walk into a carrier storefront, and choose from several phones with ~$200-250 price tags.<p>When you see an iPhone next to a Galaxy or an HTC variant with carrier logos plastered all over it, the iPhone seems like the most &quot;premium&quot; option and the price difference is either minor or nonexistent.  Besides, the iPhone, through a combination of legitimately good track record and expert marketing has an excellent reputation.<p>But if you&#x27;re buying your handset outright, those other devices with less (or essentially no) marketing like the Moto X or the Nexus 5 start to stand out a little more if you&#x27;re not married to one platform or the other.  The difference between $200 and $250 isn&#x27;t much to the person buying subsidized but the difference between a $350-400 handset and a $650-800 one is obvious.  You can almost buy two Nexus 5&#x27;s for the cost of an iPhone so the glass and metal &quot;industrial design&quot; may start to matter less.  At least that&#x27;s what happened for me.<p>When I stopped doing the contract-and-subsidy thing to switch over to a $30/mo prepaid plan, I considered an iPhone 5S (the current iPhone) and the Nexus 5.  The iPhone was maybe a little bit more capable and had nicer construction but if I got the Nexus, I&#x27;d save enough to pay for 11 months of service.<p>Maybe I&#x27;m just a compulsive bargain shopper and spend a lot of time looking for the best bang to buck ratio.  Maybe I&#x27;m just a cheapskate.  Either way, my concern wasn&#x27;t about targeted ads based on my search and navigation history.

Yes there is. Everyone uses body-language. Everyone uses their mouth, their eyes and their hands. Take in sign language. While it&#x27;s not the same in every country, someone fluent in any sign language can understand BSL (Brazil Sign Language) or NZSL (New Zealand...), ASL etc. Why? Because sign language is the most literal thing you can think of. If I look at someone and point to them, then point to someone else, what do you suppose that means? The only issue is local dialect/slang which is easy enough to figure out.<p>I&#x27;d like this BBC article to try this on deaf people and see what the results would be. It would be extremely different. Even for people who just wear hearing aids: a frown, does not mean anger... it means they&#x27;re trying to understand you. If that person misheard a previous question, but then didn&#x27;t mishear it the second time then... are they lying? No.<p>For myself in particular, when I was trying to have conversation with people I had a few difficulties. For this, think of dyslexia, say the brains language processor. For some people with dyslexia an example sentence could look like: &quot;I ___ to ___ shop ___ the ______ ____ ___ car&quot;. It&#x27;s exactly the same for someone who is deaf. However, they need to be working that language processor in their head 300% capacity. Not only are you lip-reading, using sound from your hearing aids, you&#x27;re factoring in context, location, the person talking to you, body-language and so on. So a deaf person, will then fill in those blanks in my above example and hope they got it right. Except, by that stage, more has been said and you&#x27;re now trying to remember what was said just a few minutes ago. Then you&#x27;re defeated.<p>However, if you watched my body language in ann airport you&#x27;d probably shoot me or whatever customs does. I&#x27;d be the ideal &#x27;liar&#x27; that this BBC article refers to.<p>Since I got my cochlear implant, (I jumped from 4% hearing to something like 80% upwards) my world has grown incredibly. Not only do I have my previous skills, but I can now add verbal input into my once stressed language processor. It&#x27;s incredible what I can pick up on. Now that I have that extra sense/input, I find that I can tell whether someone is not being truthful or honest. Another poster here said that &quot;give them enough rope to hang themselves with&quot; and that&#x27;s very true. Someone rambling? Watch their hands. Someone straight to the point, confident, and uses no body language -- very confident of themselves. So simply throw them off. Does their attitude change? If it does, what does that mean? Context comes into play here, and customs simply don&#x27;t have the time. Nor will Police.<p>Someone trying to explain the minute details of their drive to work, watch their eyes and see where they go (looks you in the eye, wall, phone?). Then stop. Who exactly remembers details that they&#x27;ve got no reason to remember? So they&#x27;ll tell the short version, &#x27;cos they have done it 1,000 times. Then if you&#x27;re probed such as this article says... you&#x27;ll end up getting anxious, and contradict yourself. &quot;oh, maybe I did take Stuart Street...&quot;.<p>I am a firm believer that body language is really a good way to determine language nuances, even in different languages. It works. I&#x27;ve been friends with people who didn&#x27;t know English, but I could communicate with them effectively enough. Giving someone a few weeks of body language training, is going to do squat. Getting experts, again I&#x27;m not sure -- have they ever had to <i>rely</i> on it? Perhaps they should wear headphones with whitenoise and interrogate people, with someone who is listening -- and compare notes.<p>I kind of feel like writing a blog post to refute this article, with proper examples etc. Would anyone be interested?<p>I apologise if I sound disjointed it&#x27;s 3am in NZ right now, and I just had the need to go &quot;no this is not quite right&quot;.<p>P.S. When I went to Singapore, a customs person glared at me and nodded to the guy with the gun and so I smiled and I said, &quot;Hi! I hope you haven&#x27;t had a horrible night so far -- hopefully my documentation is in order and you&#x27;ll not have to deal with boring stuff!&quot; and she went from >:{ to :-) and nodded to the gun guy walking behind me, who turned around back to his spot. I got all that from a split second glance. It&#x27;s actually even easier for me now with my implant to do this sort of thing in case actual spoken communication is required.<p>EDIT: As per article, it is common sense -- but you need to know someone well enough to take judgement, which these guys have no time for. Speaking for myself, I learned over a long period of time to do that as quick as possible. Otherwise, I&#x27;d have been left to fail.",1441638610

While agent forwarding to the final host isn&#x27;t necessary, your network is compromised, meaning that other important thing most likely got stolen, just not your private key.

In this case, having private keys for different purposes would be a good way to isolate things, just in case. I personally separate work keys and private (as in spare time) keys.<p>I know I&#x27;m exaggerating the comparison a bit, but the setup required to take over agent forwarding on a network you control, means that you&#x27;re screwed regardless.

On some older phones there is not a whole lot of space here.  For example it didn't take a whole lot at all for me to fill up my Nexus One's app partition.<p>It wasn't until 2.2 that the option to move apps to a encrypted location on the SD card was added, and even then it's an option that has to be enabled by the developer who released the app.<p>Newer phones these days have more onboard space and this shouldn't be nearly as big an issue. I upgraded to an HTC Thunderbolt on Saturday and it has roughly 2GB available for onboard apps.",1309283992

2706425,comment,2705440,2705440,1,0,angerman,,,"I wonder if this is the common theme among many of us who try to put apps in the app store: figuring out what does not work. For our app: iEBT (which is an interface to a server allowing you to track your euro notes: eurobilltracker.com), we not only took a very tiny niche, but didn't think about marketing either.<p>What we did was this:
- picked a somewhat hight price point ($2)
  This seemed to use like the sweetspot, with what we could live and what we would expect an
  honest buyer to pay. (who knows?!)<p>- we wrote to the canonical forum, where we expected most of the potential users.
  That resulted in an initial rush (two days after writing to the forum), but it wasn't
  much at all.<p>- the domain iebtapp.com was registered prior to publishing, but contained nothing more
  then a simple ""Something's coming this december"" string. Watching the server logs, there
  seemed to be some who were trying to figure out where the link from the app pointed.<p>- after some time, we wrote the current, very limited text on iebtapp.com. Not even with images.
  That seems to have resulted in a minor increase in sales.<p>- with some text on the website, we thought it was time to do some advertisement, and went with Google Ads.
  This too seems to have resulted in a minor increase in sales.<p>And here's what we plan to do:
- add Appirater to the App. We have only a very few reviews, and they are not enough to get any star rating
  on the AppStore. Maybe this helps, who knows. I will closely watch this.<p>Personal conclusion:
iOS development is really /a lot/ of fun. But I think we need to change two things:
- More marketing. But not all at once; results should be measurable.
- Niche markets, that are this tiny, can be a very high risk game. (Especially if someone
  else, writes to the forum that he's going to release another iPhone app and lets people
  sign up for the beta :-))<p>--

Just as the ISPs are told they have overriding duties to users of their networks not to discriminate, etc., so advocates of search neutrality want to impose legal duties on search engines to abide by overriding principles as follows (quoting from a brilliant dissection of search neutrality by law professor James Grimmelmann, found here: <a href=""http://works.bepress.com/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1034&context=james_grimmelmann"" rel=""nofollow"">http://works.bepress.com/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1034&#3...</a>):<p>""1. Equality: Search engines shouldn't differentiate at all among websites.<p>2. Objectivity: There are correct search results and incorrect ones, so search engines should return only the correct ones.<p>3. Bias: Search engines should not distort the information landscape.<p>4. Traffic: Websites that depend on a flow of visitors shouldn't be cut off by search engines.<p>5. Relevance: Search engines should maximize users' satisfaction with search results.<p>6. Self-interest: Search engines shouldn't trade on their own account.<p>7. Transparency: Search engines should disclose the algorithms they use to rank web pages.<p>8. Manipulation: Search engines should rank sites only according to general rules, rather than promoting and demoting sites on an individual basis.""<p>Professor Grimmelmann goes on in his piece to critique each of these professed goals of the movement and to describe the legal implications of each.<p>Of course, if you open this gate in naked form (i.e., by explicitly adopting laws that expressly require search engines to abide by such duties), you effectively set up all search engines to be devoured by litigants and their lawyers, who can second-guess every decision, who can seek damages based on such second-guessing, and who can ask every manner of regulator to step in to supervise how search results are generated - all pretty much the antithesis of what we are accustomed to in this area and a serious step back from freedom (in my view) in an all-important area that affects us all profoundly in the modern digital world.<p>All this is mostly academic today except in the case of Google, which has to face such claims couched in terms of its allegedly abusing its monopoly position in various markets. Whenever you hear the innocuous-sounding term ""search neutrality,"" however, realize that this is the direction in which it seeks to lead us if given the full implementation sought by its advocates.",1309282770

At any rate, here are some ideas from an iOS developer with nothing shipped yet, for what it's worth:<p>Be way more explicit with your branding and marketing about exactly what the game is, right down to the name, if you're willing to change it. Looking at the top charts right now, there are games that show you exactly how to play just with the title and the icon: Fruit Ninja, Cut the Rope, Flick Golf, Feed Me Oil. You want to be <i>the</i> gyro shooting gallery app. So, something like Gyro Shot or Gyro Shooting. It's sounds lame but it seems to work. It may also give Apple a reason to feature you, since you are demoing a hardware feature.<p>I think you also need a more fun look. The game looks really drab right now. A grey factory is not a terribly exciting backdrop and the balls are pointy. Choose a look that you can execute at grade A level. This is where the ""glowing neon"" look came from -- programmers who can't do art. Use shaders to make the balls perfectly round and give them some sort of cool effect.

Unfair competition (per California's law) caused damages [<i>by for instance causing people to pick Dropbox instead of some other less expensive storage solution.</i>]<p>2. Invasion of privacy, for which punitive damages are being sought.<p>3. Negligence [<i>for enabling that invasion of privacy</i>], for which actual damages are being sought [<i>whatever those might be... maybe things like, billable time being spent moving files off Dropbox?</i>].<p>4. Breach of express warranty, for which the purchase price of Dropbox is sought.<p>5. Breach of implied warranty, for which the purchase price of Dropbox is sought.<p>Not a lawyer, am a security practitioner, somewhat versed in the issues here, and:<p>This probably doesn't go anywhere. Don't these cases have to pick up a certain amount of steam before they matter? My sense of it is, as bad as the security lapse at Dropbox appears to have been, it was an issue primarily for the geekerati; ""my mom"" probably doesn't care, and might even assume stuff like this happens all the time. If it did go somewhere, presumably Dropbox would just provide vouchers for refunds for people who want to close their accounts.<p>There is, as I understand it, still no formal standard of due care required for software vendors. There was no slam-dunk tort available for the plaintiffs in the CardSystems case, where a card processor lost millions of credit cards. Similarly, lapses in Microsoft code enabled tens of millions of machines to be compromised during the ""summer of worms"", and the class action case brought against it was dropped as well.<p>Meanwhile, contract law is of little use, because virtually every professional piece of software is shipped with an airtight contract limiting the vendor's liability for defects. This complaint alleges some form of breach of contract, but it's entirely possible that such a claim dies a quick death when reconciled against the Dropbox user agreement, which surely says something to the effect of ""shit happens, if you can't deal, use an external hard drive instead"".<p>For a 2005 perspective on the issue by two law professors, which reaches the conclusion that we need to create a whole new tort (""negligent enablement of cybercrime"") to address the issue, check out:<p><a href=""http://www.law.suffolk.edu/faculty/addinfo/rustad/rustad.koenig.final.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.law.suffolk.edu/faculty/addinfo/rustad/rustad.koe...</a><p>Without going into another 7 grafs of noodling about whether software liability is a good idea or not, let me just say one thing I'm fairly confident of: the industry cannot afford a ""due care"" standard for software. Security flaws happen all the time, in everything anyone ships. You don't hear about most of them. Simple supply & demand has driven software security bill rates to very high levels, and that's largely without any legal mandate that would effectively require everything to get assessed.",1309280804

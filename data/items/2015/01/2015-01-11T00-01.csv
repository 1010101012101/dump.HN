Passion about something is not something that you wake up in the morning, think about a bit, and then go pursue it.<p>You won&#x27;t find a single story in legacy business history of someone who started a wildly successful business because they woke up one morning and thought &quot;I want to start a business&quot;. It happened the other way they were going about their business and noticed a need or had an inspiration or idea and then decided to pursue making it a business. Only exception is now in the current day and age we have so many people doing so many things with ease of entry some people are able to pull this off it seems.<p>In the case of YC or other incubators we now have people who are attempting to just &quot;come up with an idea and fill a need&quot; and while some are succeeding it&#x27;s not the way businesses have started ever before. Generally. And the process of finding something takes time as well and there is much serendipity involved (and that doesn&#x27;t operate according to a schedule either).<p>Now it is possible to &quot;think up&quot; a business but that process can take years. In the case of my first business I had the inspiration one day while in college, pursued it out of college and then thought of a better idea which is the one I actually did. The process took time and there was no particular deadline. That idea worked and I sold the company (9 years later).<p>The 2nd business on the other hand took me 4 years or 5 years to come up with an appropriate &quot;inspiration&quot; as I investigated various possibilities (flying around to trade shows). There was no deadline that I was working under (&quot;demo day&quot;). Just whenever I found something I would do it. And I finally did and it worked out as well.<p>My point is, I don&#x27;t think you can say to someone &quot;focus on an idea you are passionate about&quot; and they go off and &quot;think&quot; and come back with &quot;yeah we want to do X we are passionate about it&quot;.",1420937129

The method of water simulation that is used here doesn&#x27;t lend itself to simulating the effects of things like water tension or breaking waves. This is because the water surface is represented as a 2D height-map, representing the displacement from equilibrium (i.e. the z coordinate as a function of x and y). It&#x27;s clear that it is not possible to represent water clinging to the sphere or dripping off it.<p>A particle-based system could simulate the effects you describe (by keeping track of the positions of some large number of water &quot;molecules&quot; and exchanging forces between each pair of particles), however the simulation would be far too costly to run in real-time on typical hardware today. It also has its downsides. With a height-map based representation it is trivial to calculate the normal to the surface of the water, which is necessary for the lighting effects, but with a particle system you would need to reconstruct the surface of the water in an additional step each frame, using something like the marching cubes algorithm.",1420937032

8868566,comment,8868314,8868314,0,0,jakobegger,,,"Something interesting has been happening in the Open Source world. In the beginning, open source software was developed mostly by academics and free software advocates. Copyleft licenses like the GPL became very popular as a means to prevent for-profit companies from using all this free software without giving back. There seemed to be a struggle between closed source proprietary software, and free open source software on the other side.<p>The lines have blurred, and now a lot of open source projects are developed and maintained by for-profit companies. Projects like clang, SQLite or PostgreSQL are all developed mostly by profit-oriented companies. These projects use liberal licenses; they aren&#x27;t interested in &quot;protecting&quot; their code -- for these projects, the situation is actually reversed. Proprietary software vendors make large parts of code freely available to the world!<p>Maybe this is a result of the GPL; evil corporations are afraid of the GPL and therefore they support projects with liberal licenses.<p>But maybe the GPL is just not necessary anymore; companies see the inherent advantages of open source and make (some) code available even without the GPL gun pointed at their head.<p>What a wonderful world this would be!

I could have a set of likely endings prior to the substitution cipher for the passwords in each database, and this would allow me to use something like the E/M algorithm to work out a distribution of most likely partial substitution cipher table, common word, and space bar values, which I could then combine with likely &#x27;identifier&#x27; plaintexts to prioritise the order in which I send passwords to use against the secure site.<p>All of this would likely be completely automated - and if a significant number of people are using these cards, for certain types of criminal enterprise there is a good chance that it would be cost effective.<p>All in all, people using this card are taking a very real security risk that is completely unnecessary when there are other better alternatives (like using a password manager, and generating a completely different secure random password for each site). Encrypting the database with a strong password and an expensive key derivation function also complicates other types of attacks (for example, someone secretly going into your wallet and photographing the card) - obviously, they could try to install a keylogger on your phone or computer with the password database, as well as copy your password database, but that probably takes longer and carries more risk of getting caught than photographing a card.",1420936543

8868490,comment,8863257,8866001,0,0,graycat,,,"That my Web pages should work nearly
everywhere is not a big deal.  Instead, it&#x27;s
simple.  Except for a little JavaScript 
Microsoft writes for me, I&#x27;m just using
some simple, old HTML with a little CSS.
What goes to the client is, for the Web, just
dirt simple.<p>Then each Web page is exactly 800 pixels wide,
small screen, big screen, small window, big window,
Internet Explorer, Firefox, Chrome, etc., all the
same exactly 800 pixels wide, period.  There are
both vertical and horizontal scroll bars.
The content of the pages is really simple,
basically just some text, a simple PNG image,
some links as at the top of these pages at
HN,
some simple, standard HTML <i>controls</i>,
and nothing else. As I recall, the
fonts are all 35 pixels high, that is,
relatively large fonts.  All the layout
is with just HTML tables -- I&#x27;m not
asking the Web browser to position or
scale anything.  No roll overs, pull downs,
pop-ups, icons -- HN doesn&#x27;t have such either.<p>So, on any browser window with at least 800
pixels of width, my Web pages should look fine;
some users may want to use some
magnification option in their Web browser --
I&#x27;m not going to program that logic.
Simple. Dirt simple.  No doubt.  That
my Web pages take up only 800 pixels
of width on some workstation screen 
4000 pixels wide is okay with me.<p>If my site has any value, then it&#x27;s not in
fancy HTML, CSS, or JavaScript.  Same for
HN.<p>I can understand that for a lot of sites, 
there is client side JavaScript that
keeps looking at the size of the browser
window and walks some tree of the
document object model or some such
and dynamically positions text,
ads, images, video windows, etc.
That could get complicated on one
computer and much worse on 
a billion computers from
smartphones to workstations.
For solving that problem, I didn&#x27;t
figure out how or even attack it.
If you are working on such a problem,
you have my sympathy;
if you get a good solution, you 
have my congratulations.<p>What I&#x27;m doing is dirt simple;
no doubt you could have done it
easily except for just one issue:
Do you want such a simple Web page?
HN does.  Some other sites do.
So do I.<p>But, yes, when my site goes live, I&#x27;ll
eagerly announce on HN.  Then you can all
say that my Web pages look like they
were designed
by 5 year old child in 1995
in 15 minutes after stealing 
five beers from his parents&#x27; refrigerator --
will be about right.  Even more likely,
by a drunk, baby T Rex.
I&#x27;m not trying to
build a brick outhouse or use a $3 million
Ferrari to get six loaves of bread and
three gallons of milk.  Instead, simple
as possible but not simpler.",1420934800

8868464,comment,8865553,8865553,0,0,davismwfl,,,"If you aren&#x27;t having cash flow issues, then just setup auto payments.  Most companies do auto ACH for no charge, and even some offer a discount for it.  My car loan company gave me a lower interest rate to do the auto ACH, not that it made that big of a difference but a quarter of a point was still nice.<p>If you have cash flow issues sometimes, then setup the base ones you can on the auto ACH, and others set on a calendar reminder. My bank lets me schedule the payments but then it reminds me before they come due so I can either adjust them or let them stand.  I love that cause it makes it easy to work with those times when there is a cash flow crunch and I have to move a payment out a little or something.<p>One other point, to protect my credit, I have my credit cards (all 2 of them), setup to make at least the minimum payment + $25 just so I can&#x27;t fuck up and miss them.  I did that when I was younger a few times and man it sucks.  But if I want to pay more then I just log in and make an &quot;extra&quot; payment which makes life easy.<p>Last thing, I don&#x27;t do it, but I have a friend that has a specific account that he puts only X dollars in each month through his paycheck deposit. So X goes into that account and the remainder goes into his main account (almost every payroll department supports split deposits).  He then has all the auto payments come out of the one account where he puts the X dollars into.  He likes this because if one of the vendors has something hacked his risk is limited to only what was in that account, plus he never has to think about those payments.  Just another idea for those worried about vendors having their primary account information, personally it makes sense to me I just have been too lazy to set that up.",1420934409

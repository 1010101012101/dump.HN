Now I could just roll back my source and build from that, but that takes significantly longer than just copying the regression build from the server. (Not to mention that if the revision is old enough, I need to install an older OS and Xcode just to build it.)<p>But our archives are straight out of an Xcode development build - they contain separate libraries and frameworks that we build and that aren&#x27;t moved into the executable like during an install. So to run them from a disk image you need to set DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH and DYLD_FRAMEWORK_PATH to get the OS to know where to look for them. But this doesn&#x27;t work with SIP.

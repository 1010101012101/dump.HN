94037,comment,93944,93973,0,0,raju,,,"I am indian, and though I have spent only a small portion of my life in India, I think there are several reasons ""why they are not taking over the world"". [Disclaimer - I too am an H1-B holder]<p>1. India is a country of over 1.3 billion people, and about half are illiterate. So, yes, there are many engineers clamoring, but the number relatively is not as high as it should be.<p>2. There is a fairly high degree of corruption, which in this case is the result of a lot of red-tape. Getting anything done means having the resources and or money or both to get anything done, which kills many enterprising ideas<p>3. The high population results in the infrastructure bursting at its seams, and often most places other than the big cities to be lacking. This makes places like the US seem extremely attractive alternatives. A lot of the people who graduate from the IITs (Indian Institute of technology), and many engineering school (almost all my friends) are abroad.<p>There are several other reasons but I hope this puts it in perspective. Though these days (from what I hear, I haven't been back in some time) times are a-changing. I hear a lot more about the startup scene in India, and with the influence of big corporations like Google, the government seeing that India has the potential to be a technical center in the world, the growth of indian firms like Wipro and infosys, the Ambani and Ispat group maybe this can be avoided.<p>Hope this puts some of this in perspective.",1199151007

94031,comment,93984,94010,0,0,qaexl,,,"I generally agree with you here. <p>I also think that undergraduate CS degrees today, are diluted. That's not to say I have not met folks who know what they are doing with their CS degree. They are also the ones paying attention in class. For those that don't really know how to program ... they got about as much skill as a non-techie who goes off to try to do their own thing.<p>With regards to the English major. It was very possible that he programmed computer as a kid, tried to get a CS degree, and failing that dropped back to English. I'm not saying that this is what happened to him. I do know of a few folks at the local university it happened to. So far, they have not tried to get a programming job.",1199149797

Right now he looks every bit as ugly as the people he's vilifying. That's a shame.",1199149525
94027,comment,94003,94003,0,0,qaexl,,,"By way of disclosure, I make my living off of Ruby on Rails. I'm not a mover or shaker -- not on the core team, and at most, I hang out on the #rubyonrails channels. I never met Zed Shaw, but I have known of him as the creator of Mongrel. The interviews with him about Mongrel were always prefixed by the author that he talks bluntly with a lot of zingers. Guess that meant he was really foul-mouthed. <p>I have also read through this entire, long rant. I can't say whether he was being truthful about not having a job as a result of Mongrel though I don't doubt it. I do know a lot of the things he ranted about in the Rails community were true, from my perspective.<p>For example, that weird <a href=""http://example.com/posts/1;edit"" rel=""nofollow"">http://example.com/posts/1;edit</a> was a very strange one. I thought that looked pretty ugly the first time I saw it. When it got finally fixed in the 1.2 and 2.0 series, the release note contained a very strange note. It said that it was ""fixed"" because some servers like Mongrel could not handle it, suggesting that it was a result of some brokenness on Mongrel's part.<p>That was very strange to me because I knew Mongrel's HTTP parser was actually generated straight from the RFC. If anything, it is probably the world's most standards-compliant HTTP implementation. <p>$500 for 5 minutes of work for someone of Zed's quality is pretty cheap, by my book. <a href=""http://fridayreflections.typepad.com/weblog/2007/12/experience-is-n.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://fridayreflections.typepad.com/weblog/2007/12/experien...</a><p>The 'Ezra' referenced as the creator of Merb is widely known as the go-to guy to make your Rails deployment scale. <p>I don't know about the cgi bug. I do know making the cookies-based session key default is <i>really</i> weird. <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=81932"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=81932</a><p>The stuff about the core team's herd mentality is true from what I've seen hanging out on #rubyonrails for nearly two years. You can also look at the record on the number of rejected patches on the Rails tracker. The general consensus among the folks who try contributing stuff, but not on the core team, is that if they don't use it, it is unlikely to make it in. In a lot of ways, that is similar to the way Linus Torvald's works with Linux kernel devs, with the exception that every Linux core dev has their own repo you can pull off of as an alternative to the ""official"" Linux kernel.<p>Finally, the bit about passive-aggressive behavior. That's something I see in any grouping of techies and geeks. I try to avoid it where I can, but it still gets under my skin. My tendency is to confront the issue and then be done with it.   The first part of Zed's rant seems full of hate, but the boxing ring strikes me as a good idea. <p>A good friend of mine once explained to me about the passive-aggressiveness at the local university's lan-gamer's club. Two brothers took official positions in that student club. The older one is passive-aggressive, and the younger one is just aggressive. I perfer hanging out with the younger one. Sure, he can go beserk but at least he's honest about it :-) My friend told me the older brother was a better fit as the club president simply because he knows how  use passive-aggressiveness effectively. That in a group like that with a high percentage of passive-aggressive people, these guys will not respond to any social sanctions unless it <i>is</i> in passive-aggressive form. Which is also why I don't really hang out with the gamer's club. Meanwhile, the younger brother is more marginalized when it comes to influencing that group.<p>All of this makes for a very interesting discussion when put in the context of this <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=92792"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=92792</a><p>Despite making a living off of Rails, I have not really gone out of my way to network with other Rails dev so I can't really say if the percentage of passive-aggressive devs are greater in the Rails community than without. I can say that I'm not surprised that Zed got marginalized like this, even after writing awesome code like Mongrel.<p>I have been hearing about Merb for a while on #rubyonrails. After reading this article, I think it is about time to take a serious look at it. I don't want to give up Ruby, but Rails has always been a means to an end.",1199149231

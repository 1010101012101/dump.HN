4519491,comment,4518899,4519402,3,0,brc,,,"What I mean is that millions have died when leaders have set out on creating a utopian society.  Because individuals wants and needs are necessarily diverse, they cannot be forced into a set pattern by dictat of a leader.  When this has been tried, it has led to the deaths of millions.   That is because the very nature of a utopian vision is radically different per individual.   So the implementation of a particular individual utopia - or even a shared vision of a small group - must necessarily mean either excluding or enforcing that vision on people who don't agree with the vision.<p>What I mean is that millions have died because of the chasing of utopian dreams by small groups.  Being killed by your own government, either directly, or via its actions, is the ultimate in unnecessary and premature death.",1347584163

But that is incompatible with the idea that all their competitors can trivially produce equally good products just by watching what Apple does. Even while the law suits are trying to send the message that Apple's innovations are protected, they actually send the opposite message: Apple is under threat <i>because the qualities that make Apple's products great are easy to replicate</i>.

4519482,comment,4518899,4519356,2,0,brc,,,"Well, I've spent a lot of time doing more than a casual reading of history, and I certainly don't subscribe to a 'post-scarcity' view of the world.<p>The human desire for a better life is insatiable.  By a better life - this doesn't necessarily mean bigger houses or shinier gadgets - though that is a feature of the current generation, and just about every one before that.  By a better life, I mean more health, better education, and a longer and happier life for ourselves and our offspring.<p>Even if, using the thought experiment, we can supply the basic needs of survival for the equivalent of the first ten minutes of our labour per day - most peeople are not going to choose to spend the rest of the day doing nothing.<p>Taking food - already in most developed places excess calories are a problem rather than insufficient calories.  But even then, when faced with more choice, many people choose to select organic or specialty foods, which require more of their available funds.  Choosing an all-organic diet might take up 2 hours of your working day to purchase, but that's a choice many will make.<p>Similarly, the ultimate human demand - a longer life with less health problems - will never decrease.  So even if the provision of basic staples as a proportion of economic activity decreases, it will be offset by increases in unlimited demand for specialised healthcare.  Specialised treatments are the ultimate consumable - like fine porcelain dinnerware,  what was once available only to the wealth gradually becomes more affordable to more people.<p>My understanding and interpretation of all the recorded human history I have read is that the desires for a better will never be sated.  Going to a world in which there is no scarcity means arbitarily drawing a line under 'what is necessary' - any rational observer would say that line has long since passed in many societies - but people don't want to stop at that line.  The only way to make that happen is to coerce people to stop at a level of particular of consumption, and that is something I want no part of.",1347583890

There was a bit of entrepreneurship among the younger Argentinians I met, particularly in Mendoza and Buenos Aires where many were trying to start businesses, though that might be because there weren't many alternatives. Also, there's great agricultural export potential - Argentinian beef and wine are fantastic, but for some reason you can't really find much of that on U.S. shelves. The country itself is beautiful to visit, and it was pretty cheap for an American to get around (as it probably is now).<p>Still all was not good.

I've had two apps featured by Apple and one app selected as a staff favorite by Apple.<p>In June, when Apple changed their search algorithm, my sales dropped by 70%. The decline continued until it stabilized at around  $700 a month. I went from $5,000 a month of steady app sales for over two years to $700 a month.<p>Free apps that are completely unrelated to education now show up in search above my apps.<p>When IOS6 is released to the public, I expect my sales to fall even more. I may not even hit $300 a month when IOS6 comes out.<p>The App Store in IOS6 is broken. You can only browse one app at a time when you search. Throw in a broken search algorithm and app discovery becomes very difficult.<p>Current search results favor free apps with a lot of downloads. The new App Store also does not have a newly released section. So it will be very hard for new paid apps to gain traction.<p>I tried external marketing. I tried blog reviews. I tried mobile ads. Nothing helped. If your apps can't be found, nothing external is going to help. If I give a customer my app's name and tell them to download it on the app store, they will most likely end up downloading someone else's free app because they could not find my app.<p>As a comparison to this, my gadget & tech site has been earning a steady $60/day for seven years.<p>I'm not sure what Apple's play is at this point. But I do know that this has been a painful summer for a number of IOS developers.

This seems to happen all the time - Apple creates a smartphone, using all the ""R"" that Blackberry, Microsoft, Palm and others did beforehand to inform their design decisions, and then because they add a small layer of newness they are completely blind to what they themselves ""copied"" in making their product. Everything others imitate is ""stolen"" while everything they use was ""obvious"".

That's way better than even having a sales person sight the card or magnetic stripe etc. which be easily forged.<p>Once the transactions themselves are very secure there's no longer a need for things like signatures or PINs or other layers of security.  That means you as a consumer can just walk into a store, take some things, tap your card / phone and leave.

How do you expect your passwords to autofill across browsers? It is called the login keychain for a reason. If someone has access to your user account, and your user account has associated web passwords that can be summoned without re-entering your login password, then the logical conclusion is that your web passwords are not safe.<p>However, Keychain Access is perfectly secure as a dead-simple manual password manager. Just create a new keychain (I call mine ""webpasses""), give it a password different than your login password, and manually save your web passwords in that. Yes you have to open Keychain Access every time you want to save (or copy the plaintext of) a password. Yes it's a bitch. But if you save your passwords in the correct format (description=website URL, username=website username) then Chrome and Safari will find it, ask for your ""webpasses"" keychain password, and autofill, no questions asked. Bonus points because you can save your new keychain in your dropbox and use it across multiple (osx) machines. I store all my credit card numbers in one keychain file, everything is AES encrypted IIRC so it's as good a solution as any as far as ""one-password-auth"" goes.<p>[/rant]<p>(note: I chose this solution because I am paranoid -- er, security conscious.

They can't rely on name association.  The reader has to evaluate them for their content, not their author.  This is a good thing.<p>Another thing I have learned over many years of using the web is that intelligent people do not always make intelligent comments.  We are all inconsistent; we're human.  It's foolish to assume everything Joe the Self-Proclaimed Expert says is going to be worth reading.  Sometimes he will say stupid things.  By the same token people who in the real world might not be deemed intelligent can sometimes have some brilliant insights.  It would be foolish to assume that every comment they make is worthless simply because of the name it's attached to.  Anonymous commenting allows each comment to be evaluated individually.  It addresses the inherent inconsistency of human comments and protects readers from making unwarranted assumptions.  Unless of course they assume every anonymous post automatically falls into some category with respect to its content.  IMO, that sort of thinking is the mark of web inexperience.<p>The notion of ""experts"" is vastly overrated.  This is an idea used to sell advice and services.  Socrates figured this out hundreds of years ago.  Read what Socrates learned and you too will learn something abut ""experts"" and earned reputations as ""authorities"" on given subjects.  Learn how to form questions.  In learning, it is my opinion that questions, knowing how to formulate them, are far more important than answers.<p>The web is blissfully free from the hard sell of the ""expert"" while still being a great place to discover many types of ""expertise"".  No one is demanding to see how many degrees or certifications anyone else has.  No one cares about your ""reputation"".  People are just interested in knowledge, no matter who it might come from.  They can then evaluate it on their own.  Without anyone telling them what to do or think.<p>This is not stopping some from trying to force their own system, with ""experts"" and ""reputation"" and so forth.  In my opinion, none of them will scale.  The main attraction of the web is that it is free from those sort of restraints.  There are plenty of experts on the web, but they do not have to self-promote.  They might not be trying to sell anything; maybe they just share their thoughts for the joy of sharing.<p>Anonymous posting is as close to pure thought, free from real world biases like identities, credentials and reputations, as we're going to get.

4519336,comment,4518899,4519114,4,0,brc,,,"> it seems logical to conclude that the sum total of available commercially viable jobs will decrease with time.<p>It might seem logical, but it isn't true.<p>The Luddites were people who were frightened of the introduction of machinery, and used to go around attacking factories, thinking there would be no more jobs.<p>In reality, whenever automation provides benefits through lower prices, what this does is reduce the amount of hours labor a person needs to spend in order to fulfill that need.  If you have a cow, it will take a person a couple of hours to obtain a gallon of milk, and then you have to house, feed and look after the cow.  Instead, with automated and factory-produced milk, the average person spends a fraction of that time - maybe 10 minutes - to earn the money to purchase that milk at a convenient location.<p>And so it goes with everything - whenever a product is automated and the jobs (hours) required to produce that thing is reduced, then the cost of the product falls.  The consumer then has a surplus of cash, which is really just a surplus of their time spent, to either keep for themselves, or spend on something else.<p>As human needs and wants are essentially unlimited (most of us want to go to the moon if it was possible) then, for each good that falls in price, demand will shift to other goods.  As automation lowers the cost of each additional good, a person is able to consume more of that good or more additional goods.<p>Now, you might say that 'consumption' is bad - but consuming a good might also mean consuming a service, like a movie, a local band, or an art gallery, which is still consumption, but not in the 'using up resources' manner (although nearly every consumption save for walking to a tai-chi class on the local beach uses up some kind of resources)<p>This curve of increasing standard of living is intrinsically linked to increases in productivity, which roughly means the amount of goods + services produced for the given input of working hours.<p>Thus increasing amounts of automation will never, ever reduce the supply of jobs, because each automated thing that frees up human time for something else, in itself creates activity which generally means creating more jobs.<p>You don't get an iPhone 5 to buy unless farmers can milk a herd of 150 cows singlehandedly.  And so we'll never have tourist trips to the moon unless there is increasing automation amongst industries that are currently labour-intensive.  This has been going on for a millenia, and there is no tipping-point or transition point, as it is a very smooth curve.  Yes, it can be disruptive for small pockets of workers who become no longer required - there are no more pools of typists - but at the macro level the transition is relatively smooth.",1347581317

Of course most often Objective-C coders would use NSErrors through indirection pointers in situations where Java coders would use exceptions, the use of @try / @catch is often discouraged. This is just 1 example of a possible issue, I also don't like how the namespacing is being handled (camel case name of the Java namespace). In Objective-C we're used to a 2 or 3 letter prefix. Because of issues such as these I wouldn't be very inclined to use it in my own projects.",1347581017

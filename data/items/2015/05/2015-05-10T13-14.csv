When used idiomatically, jsf removes a lot of compmexity from the stack; very little or no client side javascript, client side templating, marshalling and unmarshalling data from to json or xml representation. All these things become things the developer doesnt have to deal with.<p>BUT before i start to sound too much like a fan boy, where jsf fails is when you need to anything off the jsf path. Then you are looking at implementing custom components or tacking on the entire client side js ecosystem.<p>So, jsf may have a place for rapid implementation if your devs aren&#x27;t proficient with client side ui imo, but thats about the only time its appropriate, again imo.",1431266381

9519913,comment,9519575,9519773,0,0,StevePerkins,,,"Oh, I couldn&#x27;t possibly disagree more.<p>JEE has come a long way, and it&#x27;s a shame that people unfairly dismiss it today due to their ancient experiences with EJB 2.x.  However, JEE is a very conservative stack, which suffers greatly from &quot;design-by-committee&quot;.  Spring therefore is, was, and always will be at least a generation or two ahead.<p>JEE requires an old-school big honking app server such as WebLogic or JBoss.  Lighter-weight alternatives such as TomEE are only just now <i>starting</i> to become suitable for production use.  Because the JEE model is to have a slew of libraries loaded at the global app server level, you&#x27;re much more likely to run into conflicts with libraries that your application loads at its WAR/EAR file level.  Moreover, &quot;standards&quot; notwithstading... you <i>do</i> get locked in to your particular app server, and <i>will</i> experience breakage when migrating to a different vendor who bundles different libraries implementing those standards.<p>With modern Spring Boot, everything you need gets bundled into a self-contained and safe archive file.  Moreover, it doesn&#x27;t even have to be a WAR.  You can easly bundle a production-grade embedded Tomcat instance (or Jetty or Undertow) directly within your application, building an executable JAR file with no dependencies whatsoever apart from having a JRE installed on the target machine.  Putting an app server inside your JAR might sound inefficient at first, but it&#x27;s a devops dream and is ideally suited for today&#x27;s trend toward microservice architecture.  These days disk storage is a lot cheaper than unnecessary system complexity.  Besides, a typical app with Spring and Tomcat bundled is STILL a fraction of TomEE&#x27;s size.<p>Spring&#x27;s dependency injection is straightforward, and compatible with other JSR-330 implementations like Guice and Dagger.  I find JEE&#x27;s CDI to be a clunky mess in contrast.  In the presentation tier, Spring these days steers developers toward Thymeleaf templates, which are consistent in usage with most of the modern JavaScript frameworks they are likely using already.  JEE steers developers toward JSF, which even in its modern form tries to simulate concepts from .NET WebForms (Microsoft has meanwhile walked away from this as outdated bad practice).<p>Last but not least, there is community engagement to consider.  If you take a Spring problem to StackOverflow, you will have an answer within minutes.  Hell, you could even take it to IRC and probably get answers in real-time.  By comparison, the JEE &quot;community&quot; is practically non-existent... and if anything consists mostly of consultants seeking to sell you their time.<p>Again, JEE has indeed come light years from where it was a decade ago.  But because of its conservative, committee-based DNA... it will always be years behind Spring, and delivering solutions much more muddy and disjointed.  Spring seems to occupy an ideal common-sense spot on the spectrum.  It lags several years behind the &quot;hipster&quot; frameworks of other platforms, stealing at a stable and production-grade pace those innovations that prove themselves.  At the same time, it&#x27;s well ahead of the glacial pace at which those innovations make their way (poorly) into the Oracle-blessed standards.",1431266284

Cars aren&#x27;t allowed on tram tracks in 95% of streets where they&#x27;re on a separate lane. But even then, traffic in the city where trams are is sort of rare, most congestion is on highways where trams obviously aren&#x27;t a problem.<p>The trams are certainly not perfect and I like the metro system and look forward to the long overdue noord-zuid, but trams are an important part of the traffic mix, especially in a city in which a new metro line is very difficult.<p>There are certainly a few notorious streets where the car lane is 80% as wide as it should be, and so cars go on the tram tracks, which can suck during peak hours. But I find that most tracks run on separate heightened tracks completely. If you happen to live in one of these streets and happen to want to take the tram everyday during peak hours I can imagine the frustration. But by and large they&#x27;re really nice.<p>You mentioned New York and London, I have to say I get around easier in Amsterdam than I did while I was in these other two cities. That&#x27;s not to say Trams are amazing, but again, the traffic mix is really nice here in my opinion and trams are a part of that story.

When you&#x27;re the only one developing an app the security module can be right inside the app.<p>Some Java EE people have introduced mechanisms to do so, but the enterprise people who are still there hate it, saying a server should always be maintained by an ops team.

9519864,comment,9516217,9519604,0,0,pron,,,"> So how do software engineers manage all that? They use better languages than assembly.<p>Well, better languages than assembly, yes, but the situation is not so simple. In the past 40 years or so in the software industry, there were two, and exactly two, language-related major productivity leaps in the production of &quot;serious&quot; software: C and Java. Java didn&#x27;t add too much in expressivity over C (in fact, it added less than C++ had), and neither did C add a lot of expressivity over assembly (more convenient syntax but not too many new abstractions) -- but both added a lot in terms of safety, modularity, portability and the like.<p>The problem is that we haven&#x27;t been able to make yet another significant jump. Much of current PL research focuses on expressivity and proof of correctness -- two things that aren&#x27;t the really painful problems for the software industry these days, and aren&#x27;t what made C and Java such productivity boosters, either. In both cases, productivity was enhanced not through some clever language syntax design, but through the ecosystem the language supported (i.e. extra-linguistic features).<p>Yes, some other languages like Ruby added some productivity benefits, but mostly in the &quot;toy&quot; application department -- the same kind of applications people used to use MS Access or VB for, or other &quot;application generators&quot; prior to those -- and you see Ruby shops transitioning to Java as they become &quot;serious&quot;. The thing is that with modern hardware, even toy software projects are quite usable, but this isn&#x27;t the case with hardware design.",1431264896

Night usage can be as much as 70% than your day usage depending on the location and season.<p>Now take London for example, I pay about 1200 GBP a year in electricity, the day vs night rate difference for me is 63%ish. My day time consumption is about 20 KW/H, my night time is about 5, if i can move that around and cut my day time consumption by half which means that night will be 15 KWh and my day time will be 10KWh that will save me quite a buck if the battery can operate at an acceptable efficiency and output over 10 years, it will more or less pay for it self since yearly, at least if you don&#x27;t count in the installation and maintenance costs.<p>That said it&#x27;s probably still won&#x27;t be a money saver, the installation costs i would assume would be near the costs of the battery it self. I also have some worries about long term maintenance and the effects that i would have on the complexity of your internal power grid (e.g. will your run of the mill electrician will be able to still fix your fuse box if need be). And trough what kinds of hoops and regulatory nightmares will you have to jump to inter connect that to your grid.<p>There are also some safety concerns in having both a battery pack and an inverter (altough a low voltage one) sitting in your house now. But the biggest issue for me is that any potential saving costs are dependent on a bet that your power consumption will remain equal, and that the per KW/h power costs wont go down (which in many countries they have been going down for couple of years now).<p>Might be a neat thing to have, if the batter + installation costs for a 10 KW/H battery wont be higher than 3000 or so GBP in the UK (London) and if the average price per KW/h will remain the same or higher over a 10 year period today you might break even. So within 5 or so years with batter technology and service improvements this might actually be a really viable solution (not that you can install it in a 2/3 bed flat in London) for both improving the reliability of the grid and reducing costs for consumers.",1431264168

Basscss seems to be more modular - you can build your own &quot;version&quot; of Bootstrap - but Basscss gives you npm modules, so you could do something like/equivalent of require(basscss-grid). So, there are some differences that can be interpreted as a advantage of Bootstrap/Basscss, but react tries to solve the bigger problem IMO. Did you see that we&#x27;re adding more and more &quot;logic&quot; into CSS (like animations calculations, :first, :even etc)? Where is the line? Does CSS is still &quot;only&quot; description of the presentation or something more? To be honest, I don&#x27;t know where we are now, all those things start to merge/mix. I&#x27;d say that we&#x27;re still on a quest to find the best paradigms for the web. &quot;Regular&quot; HTML, CSS and JS were working fine, but we&#x27;re moving forward and new problems arise (how to handle different screen sizes, how can 1000 people work on the same code base, ...), so we&#x27;re trying new solutions (like react and flux).<p>So, to answer your question: Basscss could help with some of the problems with CSS but I think that react solves problem on a higher level and does it better than any other solution we have now.",1431263468

I switched to EJB3 in 2006, and I really couldn&#x27;t see why people would choose Spring anything instead. The switch to Soap, and then to Rest, was changing a couple of annotations. Not bad for a 9 year old framework.<p>Now, my biggest problem with the stack, and the reason I do not use it anymore, is Java itself. A switch to Scala makes a lot of the Java boilerplate go away, and even Java 8 doesn&#x27;t get close. Now, I find all the major Scala web libraries to be lacking, in one form or another. Play&#x27;s second compilation feels clumsy. Spray&#x27;s freedom of routing leads to very ugly code: Just look at their own large examples. So what I am currently doing is using a homebrew routing on top of Spray, which also gives me some documentation for free: Pretty useful when you have hundreds of services in hundreds of servers.<p>It&#x27;s a pity that Java itself moves so slowly, and is so reluctant from adding key features, like pattern matching, because the rest of the tooling is pretty good.",1431263368

Catch(ex) is perfectly fine, and adding 7 letters does nothing but add noise. Similarly &quot;var us = getUsers()&quot; is clear - it&#x27;s not one u, it&#x27;s multiple, and makes sense to have a loop like &quot;for u in us&quot;.<p>A better alternative if you find the code is still confusing is to add context by cutting a function up into inner functions. This is why I really hate working in languages that make it difficult to define little closures. In F#, I&#x27;ll often end up with a couple of 1 or 2 line inner functions and it makes things much easier to read. This simply isn&#x27;t practical in e.g. C#.<p>In exported function names and certain class names or modules, sure, a bit of verbosity might help. But inside a function it just make it visually harder to understand and I&#x27;ve rarely found it to be beneficial. There&#x27;s going to be enough context to load into my brain inside a function accurate, and unfortunately I still subvocalize when reading code and all those extra syllables add up.<p>Additionally, removing letters means you need to split lines less based on length and focus more on when it makes sense.",1431263134

We see this in the discussion of design issues, where informal arguments based on rules-of-thumb, reasonableness, best practices and aphorisms (e.g. &quot;code smells&quot;) predominate. There is a tendency for dogmatism to arise in this environment (&quot;thou shalt never write the same expression more than once - always factor it into a function.&quot;) (dogmatic thinking is probably confined to a small minority, but because they are vocal, they tend to dominate the discussion.)<p>I am not one of those who think a transition to formal methods is feasible, let alone that it would solve  software&#x27;s problems.

But I also see no fundamental difference to say a planned economy. Whenever the Soviet Union created their five-year plan they still tried - at least to some extend - to align demand and production, but this is of course hugely inefficient compared to a market because of the long planning interval and because it is impossible to capture the demand in detail or predict what it will be in five years.<p>There are also some advantages in a planned economy, you can for example penalize environmentally unfriendly products directly in the plan while controlling a market is only possible indirectly via laws and regulations and their enforcement which might be less efficient. But all in all market and price mechanism with some added planning, i.e. regulations where market forces are not aligned with goals agreed on by the society, seems at the very least a reasonable choice for an economy.<p>I take issues with capitalism in other places, for example with the ownership of the means of production. Let&#x27;s again take an example. You found a company, your workers produce goods or services sold for 10 millions per year. You pay 8 millions for consumed raw materials and in salaries and invest 2 millions into the growth of the company, say a new offices, a new production floors or new machines. For the moment this is all good and even necessary for the growth of the company. But when you decide to sell your company you alone get all the money your workers worked for.

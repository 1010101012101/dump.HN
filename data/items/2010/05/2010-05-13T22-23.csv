By the way, this point of logic doesn't necessarily refute the conclusion, I'm just disagreeing with the reasoning.<p>Suppose that IT Professionals fall neatly into two groups.  90% are software installers, and 10% are ultra programmers.  Software installers are poorly paid and have no programming ability.  Ultra Programmers are intensely educated, well paid, high IQ people who study constantly.<p>Software installers earn 50K/year, and Ultra Programmers earn 150K/yr.<p>Now, suppose you double the number of ultra programmers through a visa program that results in a 25k salary drop for ultra programmers.<p>Well, the average salary for the non-citizen programmers would still be well above the average pay, and it would have increased the average pay, but it would have decreased the ""ultra programmer"" pay, right?  And it would have done this in a way that led to a decrease in average pay for the citizens.<p>out of 10<p>(9 * 50 + 1 * 150) / 10 = 60 (old average for all IT pros)<p>(9 * 50 + 2 * 125) / 10 = 70 (new average for all IT pros with twice as many ultras at lightly lower pay, one citizen, one non-citizen)<p>(9 * 50 + 1 * 125) / 10 = 57.5 (new average for citizens)",1273791267

1345963,comment,1344604,1345129,0,0,anigbrowl,,,"It is sort of an ad, but a useful one.<p>I disagree about none of it being hard; there are a lot of potential pitfalls, and disputes may arise not just between client and provider, but between either of them and the labor or taxation authorities.<p>For example, A hires B to develop software tools for A's business, which takes 3 months of full-time work, during which B does not service any other clients. B gets paid and assigns all his interest in the code to A and both walk away happy. A year later B goes bankrupt or is involved in a messy divorce, and a court takes control of his assets. In the course of assessing B's financial position, they find the transaction with A was equivalent to employment, and that B's financial position would be better if it had been treated as such for the 3 months, which would in turn have made more funds available for B's alimony or creditors. A may be asked to make good on additional obligations that would have been payable to or on behalf of B, if B had been classified as an employee (social security payments or suchlike). Even if both parties agreed that B was an independent contractor, a court could invalidate that agreement on the basis that statutory obligations of employers took precedence and hold A liable for failing to meet those obligations. Or that A's payment to B was far below reasonable market rates, and the administrator of B's trust/estate/whatever may seek equitable relief from A. Or...<p>This is hypothetical of course, but not so far away from some real cases. And as far as copyright is concerned, disputes can and do arise after the fact, and an agreement that looked beautifully simple during friendship is interpreted differently under acrimonious circumstances. I was involved in a case like that last year as a witness, where a dispute arose between client and vendor relating to payment and delivery, the client sued the vendor and was counter-sued in turn, and the paperwork between them turned out to have holes big enough to drive a truck through. After a second visit to court yielded no result other than the parties threatening further legal action against each other (though mainly out of bravado rather than serious intent), I documented, copied, and quickly severed my relationship with both of them, feeling that no good could come of it.

The historical problem for Facebook is that they got a lot of their build-up precisely by promoting themselves as having a security model. Unlike MySpace, which was a big sea of public profiles, Facebook was the place where you had to have an .edu address to sign up, and your information was kept within your circle of friends (for some kinds) or university network (for other kinds), and their marketing made a big deal of that info-stays-in-your-network aspect. So people feel that Facebook hasn't been handling privacy in keeping with how they said they were going to.<p>Twitter, meanwhile, never promised you much of anything: either your profile is public, or it's private, and they've stuck to that, and AFAIK haven't made any significant changes to what ""private"" means.",1273789835

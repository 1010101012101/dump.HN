Bill Gates is one of the geniuses of our time.<p>You don't create a powerful company like Microsoft just by being lucky. This is the guy who brought personal computing to the masses. This is the guy who managed to grow his company into the behemoth that it is today. This is the guy who responded to the Internet threat brilliantly (well initially that is.).<p>Dirty tricks are PARTS AND PARCEL of the world, especially in businesses. The techies are insulated from such behavior, which is why they are usually shocked at such behavior. People on the business side are used to such behavior. They deal with it. They counter back. Wall St revel in it. Govts use them all the time. This is society at its normal equilibrium. Google, being a techie wonderland, is trying to avoid this for as long as possible but trust me, WallSt will push their hands sooner or later.<p>Paul Allen wouldn't have build Microsoft into the success that it is today. He just isn't as sly as Bill is.",1220533070

(Maybe you meant NCSA Mosaic, a proprietary program that was free for non-commercial use.) Apache came after several other web servers, e.g. Netscape's commercial one. Whether Perl is innovative is at least a subject for debate. For fairness compare best-of-breed open source projects to best-of breed commercial ones. Which is more innovative, Linux or NeXTSTEP?

And they don't have a measuring stick, they have a basket full of them.<p>From BusinessWeek:<p><i>""Many people think the definition of a recession is two consecutive quarters of decline in the gross domestic product. But that's a misperception. [the NBER] will look beyond such simple metrics, weighing monthly GDP estimates, employment data, income, industrial production, and other factors. To call a recession, they'll look for clear signs of ""a significant decline in economic activity spread across the economy, lasting more than a few months.""<p>Any call, if it comes, is going to take a while. The NBER usually takes 6 to 18 months to decide when a recession starts or ends. Hall's committee didn't announce the end of the 2001 recession until a full 20 months after the fact...</i><p>Also, an increase in GDP does not necessarily mean ""growth."" The way that they have measured this has changed over the past decade, and I think their analysis techniques are biased.",1220531502

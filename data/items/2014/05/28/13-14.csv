I&#x27;m not sure there&#x27;s a major city in the U.S. that wasn&#x27;t already a major city pre-car. And cities weren&#x27;t redesigned post-car, that&#x27;s why a lot of them have road problems.

7809860,comment,7809402,7809402,28,0,ChrisGaudreau,,,"Mocking is the primary problem with TDD as it exists right now. &quot;Isolated testing&quot; (or isolated TDD) is advocated by people like Uncle Bob. Many developers listen to Uncle Bob and end up believing that unit testing without complete isolation is not &quot;real&quot; unit testing.<p>Isolated unit testing is supposed to improve your designs. But when you mock everything, you end up with tests that know everything about your implementation (white box testing). The result is that refactoring breaks your tests. Your tests no longer document how to use the system; they are merely a mirror of its implementation.<p>Kent Beck&#x27;s central point in his book is that TDD mitigates fear, allows refactoring, and gives you immediate feedback. Extensive mocking makes developers fearful to refactor (thus hurting design) and reduces the quality of feedback. Not to mention it makes your tests hard to refactor too.<p>Martin Fowler explains the difference between &quot;classical&quot; and &quot;mockist&quot; testing:<p><a href=""http://martinfowler.com/articles/mocksArentStubs.html#ClassicalAndMockistTesting"" rel=""nofollow"">http://martinfowler.com/articles/mocksArentStubs.html#Classi...</a>",1401284989

It is a program designed to pay back a portion of salaries that go into scientific research or development. This isn&#x27;t new capital, it is a rebate program where you earn back a portion of salaries that you have already paid.<p>The challenge in SR&ED is convincing the bureaucrats in charge of the program that the salaries you&#x27;re asking for a rebate on actually went into advancing the state of technology. One problem is that many of the bureaucrats who work in this program come from accounting backgrounds. Hence the statement that you need to make sure your application contains the magic words that will get an application through.<p>In practice, the odds of an inventor receiving a full shred if she fills out her own application are nearly zero. So, to take part in a program like this, tech companies need to allocate ~7.5% of their annual research salaries to a shred specialist.<p>I&#x27;m Canadian and I pay taxes, so I have a few problems with this program. It is yet another program where you need an expert to sit in between the relevant business and the government. And, it&#x27;s a perfect example of a Canadian government program where bureaucracy overwhelms the purpose.<p>But, as someone who works in tech and has gone through a few shred processes, this program seems crazy. Who is better qualified to explain an invention than the inventors themselves? And, if you need a gatekeeper to explain your innovation, are the bureaucrats involved competent enough to administer a program like this?<p>Those are important questions for Canadian taxpayers and are most certainly not an overreaction.

The same is true for most syntax, as well as a large amount of fundamental structures, regexes, etc.<p>I&#x27;ll speak following my analogy: I&#x27;ll call Perl the Apple ][ and some language that wouldn&#x27;t be recognized as Perl by today&#x27;s Perl users, but which should be called Perl in the future I will call the iPad.<p>For example, it&#x27;s fairly clear that the iPad language should have every single variable be a full object.  The Apple ][ does not force this.   Likeweise, classes and OOP would not be optional on an iPad, but a fundamental part of writing any program.  But on the Apple ][ it is optional.  On the iPad it is clear that $_ would be meaningless and not used, ever.  It&#x27;s a syntax error.<p>On the iPad all source code is UTF-8 or Unicode, and all built-in standard operators including the iPad version of a regular expression (which uses almost none of the syntax of the Apple ][ language natively operate on UTF-8 or Unicode.<p>The iPad language is longer and has more explicit, longer keywords.  The syntax itself is extremely orthogonal and you could describe the entirety of it to anyone who has programmed in any language in a relatively low number of slides, and they can just start coding.  It is fully readable to someone who has never read the iPad language, i.e. if you were to read a numerical algorithm or datamining algorithm that was just talked about in a textbook, you wouldn&#x27;t be distracted by the textbook having to explain what the iPad is.  It speaks for itself.<p>This explicitness is part of the language; there is no way to write one-liners or extremely concise hacks the way the Apple ][ could.<p>The iPad language lives on the web.  It has primitives for handling a client connection as well as a standard framework for rich client-side connections.  A persistent connection over http is as everyday as standard input and standard output was on the Apple ][.<p>And boy can you Google this.  The Apple ][ could have a syntactic structure, special variables [1] that were almost impossible to Google.  All sorts of Context.<p>The iPad language has no such context.  There is very little you can set to change the fundamental syntax, no way to change the default index on arrays and related things, or any such high-context things or syntactic context.  There is just one context, and everything that is done in a program is spelled-out and eminently Google-able.  You never have to ask what something actually <i>does</i>, on a syntactic level, or figure it out by running it.  You don&#x27;t have to spend even six days to get to this level at the language: an afternoon tells you all the context that you will ever need.  Anything beyond that, you can Google.<p>Sure, you may not understand what a piece of code does on a higher level.  What happens if you apply a fourier transform to _____.  It may not be obvious.<p>But syntactically, it is extremely easy to read off what you&#x27;re doing.  No more difficult than reading off pseudocode in a textbook.<p>And the language is succinct.  The basic syntax is so small, so orthogonal, that you can be handed a 20-page description, having never seen an iPad language, and be able to more or less implement a version in the language of your choice, in a few weeks, without any further information or context.  There is not a lot of magic involved.<p>Of course, the only thing that the iPad language will have in common with the Apple ][ is just the brand (Perl)..or the fact that at some level they&#x27;re both turing-complete.<p>The future of Perl is calling an iPad language that is unrecognizable to any current user of Perl, Perl.<p>Gone are the days of syntactic sugar or short little idioms.<p>[1]<a href=""http://www.kichwa.com/quik_ref/spec_variables.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.kichwa.com/quik_ref/spec_variables.html</a>",1401284342

As more and more distros adopt it as the standard, and more and more software becomes dependent on it and it&#x27;s various parts, it becomes increasingly difficult to just not use systemd.

Go fix it.<p>Not everyone that uses Linux is a developer. Not every developer that uses Linux works in the realm of knowledge related to init systems. The group managing systemd is also known to be more than a bit vitriolic and opinionated - what you believe is wrong might be something they thing is right. This isn&#x27;t necessarily a bad thing - but it does mean that the idea of just fixing it is impractical, even if you have the necessary skills to correct what you think is broken.<p>>Do you think it&#x27;s done all wrong from the bottom up?

Getting a high blood pressure of 150 due to all the stress is terrifying. Yet it is what’s happening to me right now and my doctor told me to rest. After tossing and turning in bed, I figured maybe I could beg some help here.<p>I started this company two years ago and we’ve launched a unique product for Android devs. Everything seemed to be moving towards a good direction: great co-founders, encouraging customer feedback, healthy services revenue. Things seemed particularly good when a big company knocked the door with an interest for acquisition. All of the sudden things fell through. I made a mistake in my financial numbers after hiring a new developer. Two projects that were supposed to kick off last week suddenly both went dark -- I’m basically running out of money in 2 months. The co-founder told me that he would have to find a job in two months if we can’t make a living on this. I don’t blame him. He’s a good person and has helped me in many ways. I blame myself for poor planning and being overly optimistic (although I suppose, as entrepreneurs, we need to be optimistic in difficult situations?).<p>The funny thing is that we don’t need a lot to survive. A $20K would buy me a few more months to fix up things. I’ll talk to the bank tomorrow to see if we could get a loan of some sort.  I’ll keep making new releases of the product and keep finding customers. I’ll keep looking for projects. I’ll do whatever it takes to make it work.<p>I’d appreciate any suggestions, comments and critics. What would you do if you were in my position? If you know anyone who needs Android dev, I’d be happy to help. Our main area is Android, but we can do general Java dev, Haskell, Ruby, and web dev (not as experienced as in Android).  Thanks for reading!<p>BTW: I’m posting on a new account as I still want the company to look good in public. I’d appreciate your understanding.",1401283774

All cars will be queued automatically, possibly flow-&quot;optimized&quot; at junctions, behaving like a special type of public transport (if we manage to create a proper real-time highly intelligent scheduling).<p>When you look at how Google computes the fastest route in their maps/online navigation, they basically have some precomputed grid of &quot;main&quot; traffic centers, and they route all local traffic to the nearest of those centers. The main centers have pre-computed distances/times/routes between each other, so they can be stored in a distributed hashmap, and the lookup of the fastest route takes nanoseconds. The remaining &quot;local&quot; part is then computed on the fly.<p>I am curious if a similar algorithm will be used in our self-driving future - you&#x27;d have local part of the route where you&#x27;ll board a self-driving car and that will lead you to one of those &quot;main&quot; centers where a super-fast transport will move you to another &quot;main&quot; center, either by having you to board an express-train like device, or putting the whole car or just its interior there.

I&#x27;ve argued to support the idea that a physical constant terminating in base 10 is surprising. It is, superlatively so. In the words of the OP, the question you need to answer, if you think you have a constant exactly equal to 227/10, is &quot;why is the denominator 10?&quot;. It could be that 10 is a holy number, or it could be that the 10 represents some other physical quantity that you weren&#x27;t paying attention to before. But assuming it&#x27;s a coincidence is a strange thing to do, and in fact it is not natural to think that if you just looked at enough numbers of course you&#x27;d eventually see a rational one. Unless you&#x27;re choosing numbers by a process that biases you heavily towards getting rationals, you are not likely to see a rational until long after you&#x27;ve chosen an infinite number of irrationals.<p>The whole genesis of string theory was, first, observing that a sequence generated by a badly-understood phenomenon was the same sequence given by a mathematical result about strings; and then, second, concluding &quot;aha! There must be strings involved in this!&quot; Plenty of people argue that string theory isn&#x27;t going anywhere, but nobody says the conclusion &quot;there must be some strings around here somewhere&quot; was unjustified.

Unless they deny usage in a legally binding sense, there&#x27;s no reason why you should expect to see any further information about how that data is used internally. What you do know is:<p>1) that there will be no public relations consequence for breaking users&#x27; trust, because what they do with what their records is not transparent, and<p>2) that it&#x27;s legal and common to use any information gathered about you in just about any way.<p>You can either assume they&#x27;ll do what you have indicated that you prefer with the data, even if that likely involves leaving money on the table - or you can assume that they will generally do what they&#x27;re legally obligated to do, and within that, attempt to maximize profits. IMO, the former position involves imagining that a company has a personality, and doesn&#x27;t want to take advantage of you. It&#x27;s a false equivalence to assert that the latter (a company legally maximizing its resources for profit) involves a similar leap of imagination.<p>You&#x27;re not going to get information either way about what they DO until Google publicly obligates themselves with a policy document, or somebody leaks.",1401282534

That makes it at least inconsiderate of them that Pierre was not told that the changes might break optimisations in phpng - there should have been a clear communication from them that major changes were coming to php which would affect the utility of his work, and that he should consider holding off.<p>Then, the arguments made in the discussions were basically besides the point. Overall memory usage is not really important on modern hardware, since memory is cheap. The real concerns are time performance - if the performance is degraded, it would be a valid reason to reject some of the changes. The vast majority of criticisms were just along the lines of &#x27;but why do we even need 4GB+ strings&#x27; - I can see exactly why Pierre would get frustrated at having to parrot the same line. Performance in current php was clearly fine, and performance in phpng was only ever mentioned in completely vague terms - the most empirical it got was &#x27;i guess 20-30% worse&#x27; which isn&#x27;t really a trustworthy figure by any means.<p>The burden there was up to the phpng team to recognise that there were changes in the standard php pipeline that would potentially invalidate some optimisations. Coming in at a late stage and saying that it would ruin everything, having made no effort to stop someone wasting much time, was at least inconsiderate and probably rude also.<p>Then attempting to effectively filibuster the situation by repeatedly firing irrelevant arguments at Pierre, then recruiting randoms to try and vote against it as some kind of &#x27;we are being undermined&#x27; campaign, then trying to change the voting rules, it all just smacked of a very amateurish and/or rude community. Yes, they were mostly by the same people, but at some point someone could have very easily come out and pointed out (for example) the inherent fallacy in the 4GB+ argument, or the fact that the phpng developers should have informed Pierre earlier that their new optimisations might conflict. It seemed like a number were happy letting some fight their preferred argument with the wrong reasons.<p>The arguments of &#x27;wasted data&#x27; aren&#x27;t convincing - the arguments of &#x27;wasted data causes poor performance&#x27; would be convincing were there any data whatsoever to back it up, and if those who argued actually worked from that standpoint.<p>My problem was (as someone who read the mailing list) was simply that the very real concerns were brushed under the carpet, and that the situation was allowed to develop in the first place.",1401282295

I wish there was an easy way to people - especially lay users - to &quot;subscribe&quot; to a privacy-enabled version of Firefox. For instance they could be offered pre-selected choices:\n1. Block analytics [x]\n2. Destroy cookies after session [x]\n3. Block scripts [x]\n4. Prevent search results tracking [x]<p>I say this because few non-tech users know or care about the entire gamut of tracking-blocking services (beyond,say, AdBlock).

You can&#x27;t just plop lettuce into your fridge near 0c as it is quite dry (hence why fridges have crispers that maintain higher humidity for veggies, and are selectable to low humidity for fruits).<p>Frankly, if you&#x27;re not using a head of lettuce in 2 weeks something is wrong with your eating and/or buying decision making :-)",1401282038

To put the extent of this in perspective, I am noticibly more likely to feel motion sick sitting in the back seat compared to sitting in the front seat. This effect is reduced by sitting in the middle, where there are no seats/people obscuring your view. Additionally sitting in any seat except the drivers seat while travelling on windy mountain roads is a surefire way to bring up lunch. Reading while in a car is completely out of the question.<p>Comfort should be a consideration of any type of transport and the thought of facing backwards in a car makes me uncomfortable. While this shouldn&#x27;t outweigh safety, it certainly shouldn&#x27;t be ignored either.",1401282029

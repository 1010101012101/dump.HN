And longer URLs are a source of problems.<p>They&#x27;ll be more likely to be misinterpreted by a MUA, more likely to be copy-pasted badly (e.g. due to word-wrap issues), and will look more suspicious to users wary of phishing. Optimizing the URLs for length will then cause other problems, like my base64 one (where I started with hex, and then switched to a supposedly URL-safe base64 encoding). It&#x27;ll also prevent you from having a fallback mechanism when the URL does break. With state, the email can simply include the token as plaintext (&quot;If the link didn&#x27;t work type in this 10 letter code&quot;).

9055983,comment,9049467,9052523,0,0,vog,,,"Agreed mostly, but I beg to differ with your conclusion that this makes the coice of language insignificant.<p>The point of modern languages (name them functional or not) is to erade whole classes of bugs. Also, it is about making it simple to define good interfaces between components.<p>So at least your points &quot;focus on quality&quot; and &quot;enhanced architecture&quot; are directly influenced by the programming language. Of course you should train your people to focus on quality, but you also shouldn&#x27;t make it too hard to get things right in the first place. Of course you should train your people to develop a sense for good architechtures, but you should also provide a formal language that makes it more natural to express their architectural and design decisions.<p>That way, your training can focus 100% on the real issues, rather than 5% on the real issues and 95% on how to apply them in your programming language, as you need lots of workarounds, wrapper classes and so on. And you don&#x27;t only have to write them - others also have to read that bunch of mess, and reduce this to the &quot;real point&quot; in their heads. This may be considered a nice mental exercise, but in the end, it&#x27;s just boring, prone to errors/misunderstandings, and a finally waste of time.",1424078536

The comment &quot;the window for package compromise was very very small&quot; is a bit ambiguous.<p>That the security of package integrity is so fragile should greatly concern all of us. Almost all big Linux distributions rely on downloading compiled packages signed by a single key. If the build system is compromised your Linux distribution of choice will happily give you trojaned packages that you install as root. If the signing key is compromised a man-in-the-middle is required, but the difficulty to mount an attack is decreased due to the fact that most repositories don&#x27;t transport over TLS.<p>The situation can be improved in many ways. By making the build process deterministic many parties can compile the same package and compare the result, alerting the community if one of the build systems report a different checksum. Package managers like apt and yum should be extended with the ability to rely on signatures from multiple parties.<p>The Tor Project, Debian and Fedora has started working on the first problem, but I don&#x27;t know of any efforts to support multi-sig.<p><a href=""https://blog.torproject.org/blog/deterministic-builds-part-one-cyberwar-and-global-compromise"" rel=""nofollow"">https://blog.torproject.org/blog/deterministic-builds-part-o...</a><p><a href=""https://blog.torproject.org/blog/deterministic-builds-part-two-technical-details"" rel=""nofollow"">https://blog.torproject.org/blog/deterministic-builds-part-t...</a><p><a href=""https://wiki.debian.org/ReproducibleBuilds"" rel=""nofollow"">https://wiki.debian.org/ReproducibleBuilds</a><p><a href=""https://securityblog.redhat.com/2013/09/18/reproducible-builds-for-fedora/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://securityblog.redhat.com/2013/09/18/reproducible-buil...</a>",1424078223

I came here expecting to answer not to expect to develop for 30 years.<p>Ok, now for my answer. There are a few things you&#x27;ll want to look at.<p>First, I&#x27;d argue you build very modularly. You don&#x27;t know what the product is going to need to do in 5 years, let alone 30 years. Building a product from independent modules will allow future developers to add, remove or update modules to reflect the times.<p>As far as languages, go with either what is popular today, or what you have EVIDENCE will be popular in the next 10 years. I say evidence because if you just hop on the next big thing (Go, Julia, etc) because at this point you don&#x27;t know how difficult it will be to hire developers that are familiar with those languages in 10 years.<p>The libraries and dependencies answer is the same as the previous. Don&#x27;t pick something obscure that you think &#x27;might&#x27; be popular in the long-term, go with what&#x27;s popular now or has evidence of popularity later. jQuery, Bootstrap, Rails, Node.js all had massive amounts of interest right from the start. However, if you can get away with not relying on a library, you should probably do it. If you need something now to ship quickly, but don&#x27;t want it populating your project long-term, use it only in the modules that need it, and that way it can be easily replaced later (I&#x27;m doing this with jQuery now as Angular DOM traversal isn&#x27;t great.. yet).",1391118405

7153431,comment,7152671,7152671,3,0,grey-area,,,"Here are my thoughts: I managed to scrape through level 4 so saw them all - this CTF was fun and educational. Level 4 in particular felt like a real education (for me at least), and a great way to learn. Unlike many others I was fond of level 0 because it brought up questions that even beginner programmers should address - how to organise your data so that you can search through it easily, which was in some ways a preparation for the other levels. For the more expert than me it probably felt tedious or inconsequential, but it was quick to solve, and I thought inviting for beginners and open ended.<p><i>Lessons learned for me</i><p>Distributed consensus was really interesting; I&#x27;d never heard of it and enjoyed reading about Paxos and Raft, even if I don&#x27;t fully understand them yet.  Distributed searches can actually be faster than searches in one process - I didn&#x27;t believe this but as resources were limited on the server it was true in some cases (depends how fast you can make your search, mine wasn&#x27;t as fast as Henrik&#x27;s :).<p>Big scala projects take an aaage to compile - is it normally this bad in real projects? Anyone care to comment? The remote was pretty slow, so that might be why.<p>Golang needs package versioning! On level 4 there was a versioning bug with differing versions of the go-raft library being fetched locally and on the server which led to problems setting the heartbeat timeout of raft. That was confusing and annoying.<p><i>A few notes for the CTF authors</i><p>The dramatic variation between resources on remote and locally was a problem in tests - I felt like that needed to be adjusted for as the local test results were meaningless compared to the server. This particularly made level 3 and 4 difficult.<p>Code examples are great to get you started, but it&#x27;d be nice if there was also a clearly specified API for each one which you were required to conform to, to make it easier to use another language, and if the build scripts simply launched one binary at all times - level 3 had two different styles of starting the servers for remote and local for example, that was frustrating.<p>The varying test cases were sometimes frustrating, and were too varied and randomly chosen. I completely agree with Henrik that you need small tests. Each run should have say 5 tests which can be run individually (for speed), or as a suite. The downloading of tests broke a few times for me and left me stranded and constantly re-downloading new test data/tests seemed a bit pointless. Proper logging output when tests fail is really important - level3 was particularly bad for this as the diffs were useless; I had to edit the test harness to get decent output.<p>The use of the JVM on level 3 was pretty painful for me - compile times on remote were in the minutes, and I couldn&#x27;t even get it to compile locally even after installing another JVM, nor on remote without compiling all the sbt stuff - this one was probably my fault, and I just rewrote with golang in the end. Explicit language independence for all the problems would be great.<p>Unix sockets felt like an unnecessary distraction  which caused pain on level 4, it would have been nice if it used IPs, but perhaps for reasons to do with Octopus that wasn&#x27;t possible, and on a deeper level, being given broken code to fix just felt a bit wrong and distracting - having slow code you have to speed up is one thing, but having code which feels like it has been sabotaged is another.<p>Don&#x27;t bother changing the deadline even if people whine - the contest isn&#x27;t remotely fair anyway or an objective test, so it&#x27;s better to have a deadline and stick to it.<p>Oh, and thanks again Stripe, it was a blast.<p>The original code and some more writups:<p><a href=""https://github.com/ctfs/write-ups/tree/master/stripe-ctf3"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/ctfs/write-ups/tree/master/stripe-ctf3</a><p><a href=""http://blog.joneisen.me/post/75008410654"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.joneisen.me/post/75008410654</a>",1391116855

And, finally, the kinds of nuclear reactors we can build these days simply don&#x27;t produce waste that lasts that long; a good breeder reactor eats anything that&#x27;s immediately dangerous (short half-life -> lots of radiation) or long-term dangerous (long half-life -> not much radiation) [5].<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/explainer/2007/06/will_my_plastic_bag_still_be_here_in_2507.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/explainer/20...</a>\n[2] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coal_plant#Radioactive_trace_elements"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coal_plant#Radioactive_trace_el...</a>\n[3] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_waste#High-level_waste"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_waste#High-level_waste</a>\n[4] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fly_ash#Environmental_problems"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fly_ash#Environmental_problems</a>\n[5] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breeder_reactor#Waste_reduction"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breeder_reactor#Waste_reduction</a>",1391115805

7153332,comment,7144934,7144934,3,0,saganus,,,"So the post is not on the front page anymore but I guess confessing feels good juging by all the people that contributed.<p>My screwup was at my first &quot;real&quot; job, fresh out of college. I was asked to free up some space from the production server at $BIGCOMPANY, because it was already at 99% capacity (it managed to get to a 100% for a few minutes before I &quot;solved&quot; the problem). The thing is, at this $BIGCOMPANY, for some reason the budget for disk drives was non-existant, and this meant that whenever the disk usage was at or below 95%, we were <i>happy</i> because we still had free space... figure that.<p>So here I come, armed with the most dangerous tool a newbie can wield... root access and the drive to impress your boss. I said to myself, &quot;I&#x27;ve used root at my home machines plenty of times and nothing bad happened because I&#x27;ve been using Linux for several years by now and I know I need to be careful... so I don&#x27;t get why everyone says you should never log in as root&quot;. Oh boy, how I learned the hard way.<p>To continue my story, it turns out that the easiest/fastest way to free up some space was to delete the log files for pretty much everything(except the last 5 or 10 logs... because we were &quot;careful&quot;, in case we ever needed them). We usually deleted things under certain directories known to hold &quot;useless&quot; logs. So here comes Mr. Newbie-guy-with-the-need-to-shine, and I thought to myself, &quot;why keep deleting the logs from the same directories over and over if that only buys us about 1 or 2 percentage points, instead of cleaning as much logs as possible for the system and freeing up a lot more space?&quot;<p>After thinking about it for like 10 seconds the most genius thought of my career materializes: do an rm -rf *.log on the topmost level directory of where we used to store everything (webserver, webservices, databases, etc). I happily pressed enter, and a couple of minutes later, hooray! I got the disk usage down to a whooping 90%! I was a hero! that meant we had bought enough time to keep on working without worrying about the disk space for at least another one or one and a half months. This was a clear victory and an testament to my superb sysadmin skills.<p>Fast forward 4 hours, and the phone starts ringing like crazy as every other employee (non-IT ones) started wondering and then calling us to try to figure out why was their data gone. They did not understand how come they have been working A-OK so far, and then suddenly ALL data from sales team, admin team, the bosses, etc was gone. And then a few minutes later... the whole intranet came down crashing and burning.... then a full stop... nothing was working.<p>So we went to the logs directory... oops... no logs there!. Ok, let&#x27;s try to ping the DB. Dead. It&#x27;s not running and it&#x27;s responding with an unknown error. When I tried to connect to it would do so, but then some cryptic ORA-xxxxx error came up. No problem says I, I&#x27;ll just google it and fix it.<p>Not so fast young grasshopper. That error meant that the DB was out of sync with its own files used for, ironically, data corruption prevention and rollback (or something like that... to this day I still don&#x27;t fully undersand what those files were used for).<p>As far as I can remember those logs where a sort of pre-commit place, where all changes would be stored on those files and every X amount of hours the changes would get commited to the actual DB tables. It was some functionality that supposedly was used to correct corrupted entries and to recover (figure that.. ) and rollback data when lost, or something like that. And unfortunately bringing the system back in-sync was way out my league (did I failed to mention that I was by no means a DBA?).<p>However a struck of good luck came down on me, as the company had a support contract with Oracle and it was the Platinum-covered-diamonds level or something. That meant that after creating a support ticket at like 1AM, I got a call from one of the support guys like less than 20-30 minutes later. This guy seems calm and tells me I should not panick, it was just as easy as doing $crypticOracleStep1, $crypticOracleStep2, $crypticOracleStep3 and voilá! all would be good again. Except for the fact that I had NO IDEA what those steps actually required me to do. Almost in tears I ask the rep to pretty please SPELL every command I needed to execute, letter by letter. I did not want to screw up again.<p>So there I was, at close to 2AM, with my boss breathing down my neck asking me what every frigging letter of the command I was typing did (which I had no idea...), all the while trying to keep up with this supper friendly guy that was patient enough to spell everything two times.<p>After a couple of commands later, behold! the DB could be brought up again! oh boy, did I felt relieved. I was jumping up and down because I had fixed my stupid mistake... or so I thought. After almost causing the support guy to go deaf due to my loud cheering, he says &quot;however...&quot;. wait... what? there&#x27;s a &quot;however&quot;?!?. Then he continues saying, &quot;since you deleted the pre-commit file of the last day, the DB is back in-sync... up to yesterday&quot;. My jaw dropped to the floor. That meant that the ENTIRE previous day was utterly lost.... sales data, contracts, customer&#x27;s info, etc.<p>I thanked the guy for his help, hanged up the phone and turned to my boss telling him that I was ready to turn in my resignation letter just after helping capture what availabe data was actually there (in papers, by calling customers and asking them again, etc).<p>My boss then turns to me and says, don&#x27;t worry. We&#x27;ve all been through this at least once in our careers. Even I made a mistake that is terribly similar... however when I brought down the database, it took us one full week instead of one day... and rest assured that as I learned my lesson, you did as well. And I need guys like you, that have the initiative to solve things... and the ability to learn from mistakes. So don&#x27;t worry, you are not losing your job. However you can&#x27;t go home until you help everyone get as much data back as you can.<p>Aw shoot... well.. I guess it could&#x27;ve been worse. So after having lunch with my boss and the other teammates at like 6-7 AM, I went to the sales dept and started asking around how could I help them get their data back.<p>Those were the longest 38 continous work hours I&#x27;ve ever had to resist. I did not go back home until more than a full day and a half later. I was tired as hell to say the least... but to this day I think it was a blessing that I got to learn such a hard lesson but being backed up by a boss that was very cool and progressive about it.<p>Lessons learned:<p>0) Never ever ever ever use root, especially for deleting files and ESPECIALLY with the -f flag.<p>1) Do not assume that something you know will hold. Confirm it in the particular system you are going to be working with. (i.e. do not assume .log files are always log files because in your laptop that holds true)<p>2) Be ready and willing to assume the consequences of your actions. Most of the time if you assume responsability for your mistakes, people will forgive you and even give you a piece of advice.<p>3) Never ever ever ever use root.",1391115708

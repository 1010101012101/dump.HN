6575039,comment,6574005,6574977,2,0,aspensmonster,,,"My understanding from nivla&#x27;s link is that triple buffering does solve the problem. Rather than experiencing the Frequency/N fps drop when the card can&#x27;t push out enough frames, triple buffering lets the display&#x27;s framerate stay at the framerate the card is pushing, with the price being VRAM overhead.<p>But perhaps I&#x27;m misunderstanding the problem statement. The link talks merely about fps drops and how triple buffering can permit the display to be more efficient than Frequency/N fps by essentially pipelining the frames over 3 buffers to keep the monitor&#x27;s framerate at the graphic card&#x27;s framerate. However, it accomplishes this by having some frames stay for 2 cycles and others for 1. I don&#x27;t know how noticeable this is. Perhaps it&#x27;s a perceptible problem, in which case being able to dynamically manipulate the display&#x27;s refresh rate is a suitable solution. Granted, at the current price range it sounds like a cheaper solution would be to simply buy a newer model graphics card that can maintain an FPS greater than or equal to your monitor&#x27;s refresh rate. Though of course I&#x27;m sure the goal is to drive the price down and it appears they already have display partners lined up to integrate their embedded DSP.",1382147968

6575014,comment,6571844,6572719,3,0,einhverfr,,,"> That doesn&#x27;t answer my question. Storing structured data in any single-field, be it checked or unchecked, violates the first normal form...<p>This seems to be one of the most common mistakes regarding understanding 1NF I come across.<p>The atomicity requirement doesn&#x27;t say anything about structured text, or internally atomic data types.  That a data type could be further decomposed doesn&#x27;t impact first normal form at all.  Otherwise, using a data type like DATETIME would be a total no-no.  Neither does storing arrays, and so forth.<p>What 1NF requires is that for the domain the value is atomic.  If I store in a text field &quot;192.168.1.1/24&quot; that is structured text but it is still atomic.  It may include both a netmask and an IP address, but the data taken as a whole represents one domain value.  Similarly storing &#x27;1-509-555-1212&quot; in a text field contains an area code number, an exchange number, an end terminal number, and a country-code designation, but it represents a single phone number and that&#x27;s all that is required.  I could represent the phone number as ARRAY[1,5,0,9,5,5,5,1,2,1,2] and it would still be atomic as long as the array was properly ordered.<p>What I am getting at is that all 1NF requires is that the item represents a single value in a domain.<p>There&#x27;s no reason why JSON would necessarily violate that iether.  Consider {ip: &#x27;192.168.1.1&#x27;, netbits: &#x27;24&#x27;}<p>That&#x27;s <i>no different</i> from storing &#x27;192.168.1.1/24&#x27; in a text field.  And for my phone number, I could store it as {ccode: &#x27;1&#x27;, areacode: &#x27;509&#x27;, exchange: &#x27;555&#x27;, terminal: &#x27;1212&#x27;} which again is no different from storing &#x27;1-509-555-1212&#x27; in a text field.<p>This isn&#x27;t to say that JSON doesn&#x27;t often violate 1NF, but 1NF is not as restricting as people sometimes think.",1382147438

You, sir, are lacking imagination.<p>Here&#x27;s one: \nHow about the fact in some cases waiting on the latency of a data lookup before rendering the page makes it feel much slower and more sluggish?<p>In the case mentioned above of map markers, if there&#x27;s real latency involved in the lookup and you can render the page sans markers and then populate them a couple seconds later, isn&#x27;t that a superior UI?<p>Yes, if you are building a simple, moderate or low traffic website/app, it&#x27;s probably a better practice to render the page with the initial JSON needed.

6575007,comment,6574005,6574874,2,0,patrickyeon,,,"Your question was answered; it has nothing to do with the case where you&#x27;re &quot;generating thousands of frames and throwing them away&quot;. What you want is a rendering engine that will perform at 60fps in the worst case. What engine devs want to write is an engine that can do better (even much much better) than 60fps in the average case, and be allowed to slip in those pathological cases. Gamers want more frames. More frames than is noticeable. They want some slack so that if something totally unrelated to the game ties up the machine, the framerate drop is not noticeable. They want to be able to double it so that they can drive a 3D display but still have the same effective framerate per eye.<p>Having a consistent 40fps is much worse (for a gamer) than a variable framerate that will dip down to 40fps for 1% (or 10%) of the play time. Having to limit your most complex scene to what can be guaranteed rendered at 60fps is much less appealing to a developer than making sure all the likely scenes can render at 60fps.",1382147285

Of course rogue bots don&#x27;t respect this, so they get added to the blacklist rules based on UserAgent.<p>What I&#x27;ve discovered though is that bots are not my biggest worry; it&#x27;s the scrapers that are stealing my client&#x27;s content and re-posting it. We&#x27;ve successfully filed 5 DMCA complaints at this point which have been effective at stopping the known offenders, but the crawlers continue and new copycat sites keep popping up. I&#x27;ve found that running a &#x27;grep Ruby access_log&#x27; returns a good chunk of the offending crawlers (not just Ruby, also search for Python and Java). Running &#x27;host (ip address)&#x27; almost always traces back to AWS. These log entries also very rarely list a referrer.<p>Obviously not all of the grep results are malicious. A little research can reveal the IP is linked to a service or co you want crawling your site. For those that are unknown, they usually get an IP ban until I can determine otherwise (which the client is totally OK with, they don&#x27;t want their content re-published off-site).<p>I&#x27;ve thought about setting up a honeypot, but my issue was keeping the bait links hidden from legit services (plant a hidden link on the page that only a bad actor would follow, then trap their IPs in the log and ban them). Since the DMCAs have been so effective, I haven&#x27;t been forced to pursue a honeypot, but I would be very interested if anyone else has a good solution.<p>I also discovered that image hotlinking was a _HUGE_ problem with this site. The poor site had been neglected for years and hotlinkers were running wild. Shutting that down with a simple htaccess rewrite rule really helped. That is also how I discover content thieves, &#x27;grep 302 access_log&#x27; and look at the referrer URLs.",1382147173

But in reply to this specific comment I will drop you a hint (this hint is still just a small piece of the whole situation):<p>3D rendering is so deeply pipelined that it is difficult or even impossible for the program to know if a frame render is going to finish on time. It takes a long time to get information about completed results back from a GPU; on PCs you almost certainly can&#x27;t get that info during the same frame you are rendering, unless you are rendering tremendously slowly.<p>In order to make an estimate about whether the frame is going to be done in time, you would have to guess. Okay, then, so now you decided to stop rendering this frame, what do you do? Leave a giant hole in the scene? Turn off the postprocess? Draw low-detail versions of some things (hint: still very slow)?<p>Your program does not even really know for sure which pieces of the scene are fast to render and which are slow. It does not know if specific textures are going to be paged out of VRAM by the time you get to a specific mesh, or not. etc etc",1382146964

Imagine you and your friend playing on a swingset, where both of you are swinging at the same speed, but you are always at the top when your friend is at the bottom. That&#x27;s likely the most common source of tearing: the frame rendered within enough time, but due to poorly configured graphics card drivers, the game process being briefly swapped out for something else at the wrong moment, naive timing in the game&#x27;s rendering loop, or something else, the framebuffer is swapped out too late anyway.<p>The traditional way to solve this is with v-sync, which works great on realtime systems like game consoles, but on multitasking operating systems, it&#x27;s rather difficult to synchronize an application perfectly to the display&#x27;s refresh rate. As such, every graphics card I&#x27;ve ever used adds a frame or two of buffer when v-sync is enabled, resulting in a buttery-smooth but very noticeably laggy display. It doesn&#x27;t matter how intensive a scene you are rendering, either: I was playing a <i>Quake</i> source port the other day, a game released <i>over 17 years ago</i>, and even that was unplayable for me with v-sync enabled.<p>I&#x27;m very excited for this technology, because allowing programs to control both the frequency and <i>phase</i> of display updates has the potential to eliminate the vast majority of display artifacts I&#x27;ve experienced.",1382146466

We only had about fifteen three-hour lectures before the prof basically said, &quot;and that&#x27;s all I got.&quot;  Book was about 1k pages.  Drained it.  Totally forgot the title, but it was definitely a university text on MIPS and microarch.  There was a class in OS&#x27;s, data-structures, and probably some others that I could have taken instead.  I had long been trading AMD and other tech stocks and naturally had a huge preference for anything hardware.  Data Structures would have gotten me closer to writing meaningful programs faster.  It&#x27;s not clear that had I focused more on high-level programming, especially with scripting languages, that I would have had the willingness to approach lower-level tools and programming languages over the years.  My time at the helm of scripting languages has made it very efficient to tool around with various highly abstract constructions in OOP, API writing, and also making money.  My ongoing trip back into the low-level these days is what gets me excited.<p>For the record, I highly recommend magnet schools.  I highly recommend supporting increased education spending, founding companies that focus on better value for education, and especially projects like MOOC&#x27;s that can offer more selection while bringing down geographic barriers.

I have only a single data point but a friend, surely between 7 and 12 years experience in the industry, is earning a base around $150k w/ a Sr Engineer title. Now, I have no idea what his equity grant is specifically but a $150k base is, IME, competitive for somebody with that level of experience. I&#x27;m closer to 15 years myself but that is more than I was making with similar experience and title.<p>My take on this is pretty simple: There are very few labor markets I&#x27;ve heard of that are as liquid as software engineering talent in the bay area. If Facebook was paying below market rate salaries and trying to use their equity grants as justification, I think they would face a lot of difficulty recruiting top talent. Because the companies Facebook competes with ALSO have the equity card to play. And in fact, until recently, you could argue FB equity was not nearly as attractive as some of FB&#x27;s major competitors. Specifically, they were underperforming publicly traded competitors like google, apple, linked in, and netflix, and they are at a disadvantage compared to non publicly traded companies simply because the potential upside is more limited. As an engineer you&#x27;d probably make more money in equity joining Twitter today than FB. Facebook&#x27;s stock has plenty of room to grow, but to what? Possibly it will double in the next year, and triple in the next 5 years. Possibly. Compare that to the under-$20 strike price you&#x27;d get joining Twitter today and it&#x27;s not as attractive.<p>All that said, I bought a few hundred shares of FB in the mid $20&#x27;s and still see it as a good investment.",1382146277

You can&#x27;t see how that&#x27;s a &#x27;non trivial&#x27; problem?<p>The most notable example of a game using dynamic tradeoffs to maintain a solid 60FPS is ID&#x27;s Rage engine -- written by Johh Carmack, one the people on stage at this very presentation, who was lauding this technology and saying he has been pushing GPU and monitor manufacturers to implement this for years.<p>Carmack notes that while they were able to stay at 60 with an incredible amount of work, if they had been able to target 90% of 60fps with this technology there would have been little visual difference but the gameplay and visual complexity ceiling would have been vastly higher.",1382144893

Pre-sales of a single rack mountable item that can then be expanded from depending on the workload is really attractive, however. Write the software right, and it should be able to cope.<p>Pre-sales probably starts with a customer renting a single box to try out, possibly with some professional services time. The customer decides they like it, and commission a project to develop a Watson solution. IBM pre-sales then work out how many servers would actually be needed, once the customer is interested. As the solution can scale, when management goes &quot;that cost looks little high&quot; they can safely say &quot;well, if we reduce it by sixteen servers, you&#x27;ll be slightly slower but that might be ok. Then if the business decides to increase we can simply add more servers[2] at a later date&quot;. And, of course, adding more servers at a later date means more professional services time, meaning more money and more quality customer relationship building time.<p>[1] Which for all kinds of commercial reasons, we have to discount a cloud solution being the default here.

They just never bothered to optimize for any touch whatsoever and treated the platform as many companies did, like Windows Phone 7, and not something modern and new.<p>It wasn&#x27;t until Windows Phone 8.1 that IE11 began pretending to be an iPhone -- and oh look, search finally works (design-wise) if you use other providers than Bing! I re-tested before performing the 8.1 upgrade -- to this day, they still think Windows Phone 8 has not evolved from Windows Mobile days.",1413768997

8480341,comment,8479770,8479770,0,0,michaelochurch,,,"I&#x27;m going to take a contrarian view. I think that American public schools are decent. Many are quite good. Only a few are excellent, but that&#x27;s true of private schools as well. I don&#x27;t think that it&#x27;s our <i>schools</i> that are to blame for American ignorance. (And no, putting more money into them probably won&#x27;t solve the problem.) It&#x27;s economic inequality (underprivileged kids don&#x27;t fuck off because they&#x27;re stupid, but because they know that even if they work their asses off, the deck is still stacked against them) and a culture of ignorance and anti-intellectualism that pervades all social classes, top to bottom. People value ambition but not insight in this country, and deep knowledge makes you a fool who didn&#x27;t have &quot;the guts&quot; to charge into the working world, beat someone up, and take a place.<p>For the world that <i>should</i> exist, where humans of average social connectedness and social class are equipped to solve the problems bearing down on us as a species, American students are undertrained. If the shit really hits the fan on energy, ecological concerns, or social unrest... we&#x27;re all out of our depth. It&#x27;s not just the schools, with their supposedly &quot;outdated&quot; emphasis on timeliness and conformity. The first 10 years in the corporate world, except for the upper-class kids who get a rope-bridge over the shit pit, kills any creativity that people might have had. The corporate world is much more destructive to creativity and, in the long run, intelligence, than the schools are. (It&#x27;s also why intelligence tends to decline, in the U.S., after 22. That&#x27;s not normal, and in other societies, people peak much later.) This society produces one thing: private sector politicians.<p>For the jobs that most of them will actually get, American students are overtrained. You don&#x27;t need a college education to be some shitty private sector subordinate, nor an understanding of CS to do business-driven engineering in some VibratorFactoryVisitor-laden Java Shop. Knowing that stuff will just make you angry and make it harder to do your damn job, stay employed, and feed your family.<p>The claim that American schools are training kids for a 20th-century world that requires conformity is missing the point. The 21st-century world requires just as much conformity from individuals in the short term. Those lessons about not talking back to authority are just as important today. The hard challenges that humanity will face will take more, and our generation may be underprepared to take them on when they arrive, but we won&#x27;t get a verdict on that one until we&#x27;re tested.",1413768856

The creator claims freedesktop.org is some kind of generic code dump &quot;like SourceForge, github, kernel.org,&quot; except the creator fails to mention how tightly integrated systemd is with many other freedesktop.org projects.<p><pre><code>         Myth: systemd is not UNIX.\n</code></pre>\nMyth confirmed.  The creator just thinks that isn&#x27;t important, and the bits that are are matters of cultural relativism.<p><pre><code>         Myth: systemd is complex.\n</code></pre>\nMyth confirmed.  The creator admits &quot;some truth&quot; to this claim, and then goes forth to comment that the systemd approach is simpler ... because it comes in fewer packages.  Packaging is completely arbitrary -- I could put any init system AND all its dependencies into a single RPM, or even an empty RPM that builds everything at install time via scripts.  This is just handwaving.<p><pre><code>         Myth: systemd is bloated.\n</code></pre>\nMyth confirmed.  The creator pretends a minimal compile is relevant to anyone&#x27;s analysis, and handwaves away the fact that systemd has grown leaps and bounds as it solves EVERY integration problem by rewriting the relevant subsystem from scratch and including it with systemd.<p><pre><code>         Myth: systemd being Linux-only is not nice to the BSDs.\n</code></pre>\nMyth confirmed.  The creator is apparently unaware that much software that was previously portable has been rewritten to require systemd.  While these second-order effects are not the creator&#x27;s fault, the creator&#x27;s privileged position in a dominant linux organization has (perhaps unwittingly) been used to wall of previously portable software.<p><pre><code>         Myth: systemd being Linux-only makes it impossible for Debian to adopt it as default.\n</code></pre>\nMyth busted!   The creator then goes on to pretend that supporting both systemd (a monolithic all-encompassing suite of software) and classic loosely-coupled unix methodologies is a &quot;negligable&quot; amount of work.  This does not speak well for the creator&#x27;s understanding of software he did not write.<p><pre><code>         Myth: systemd could be ported to other kernels if its maintainers just wanted to.\n</code></pre>\nMyth busted!  Systemd is not and will never be portable, it is written to glom on to dozens of linux-specific kernel interfaces and become some kind of parasitic middleman to all of them.  This ob\nviously cannot be ported.<p><pre><code>         Myth: systemd is not portable for no reason.\n</code></pre>\nMyth busted!  systemd is not portable because the creator is either unable or unwilling to write portable init software.<p><pre><code>         Myth: systemd uses binary configuration files.\n</code></pre>\nMyth disingenuous.  systemd uses plaintext config files; it just chooses the silliest possible structure for those files.  The structure has no specification outside of systemd source code.<p><pre><code>         Myth: systemd is a feature creep.\n</code></pre>\nMyth confirmed.  The creator pretends that turning things off negates this, apparently failing to realize that the more &quot;stuff&quot; systemd does, the more development resources are required to maintain it, and the more difficult it is to test aspects of it independently.<p><pre><code>         Myth: systemd forces you to do something.\n</code></pre>\nMyth confirmed.  systemd forces you to run systemd in pid 1.  No other init system totally breaks down when you run something else in pid 1.<p><pre><code>         Myth: systemd makes it impossible to run syslog.\n</code></pre>\nMyth disingenuous.  This is another example of systemd as the parasitic middleman.<p><pre><code>         Myth: systemd is incompatible.\n</code></pre>\nMyth very much confirmed.  There is no way for a sysv init script to enter an infinite loop under systemd.  Systemd does not allow services to read from stdin, a fundamental interface.  Sysv services cannot get realtime scheduling.<p><pre><code>         Myth: systemd is not scriptable, because of its D-Bus use.\n</code></pre>\nMyth disingenuous.  system is <i>only</i> scriptable through explicit dbus APIs, instead of native scripting tools provided by the OS.  This is another example of the parasitic middleman effect.<p><pre><code>         Myth: systemd requires you to use some arcane configuration tools instead of allowing you to edit your configuration files directly.\n</code></pre>\nMyth disingenuous.  Systemd has no faculty for checking configuration validity aside from systemd.  There is no way to know what will work when you directly edit configuration files, because there is no specification.<p><pre><code>         Myth: systemd is unstable and buggy.\n</code></pre>\nMyth disingenuous.  It is not unstable or buggy when deployed by distributions sponsored by the creator&#x27;s employer.  Everyone else can fuck themselves, including kernel developers.<p><pre><code>         Myth: systemd is not debuggable.\n</code></pre>\nMyth disingenuous.  systemd is debuggable only with the debugging tools provided by systemd, which are not applicable to any other software and have nothing in common with tools that are.\n         Myth: systemd makes changes for the changes&#x27; sake.<p>Myth irrelevant.  What the hell does this even mean?  And why bother defending against such a meaningless &quot;accusation&quot;?<p><pre><code>         Myth: systemd is a Red-Hat-only project, is private property of some smart-ass developers, who use it to push their views to the world.\n</code></pre>\nMyth confirmed.  if Red Hat brass doesn&#x27;t like something, you can bet your ass it will not survive in the systemd repository.  Full stop.<p><pre><code>         Myth: systemd doesn&#x27;t support /usr split from the root directory.\n</code></pre>\nMyth irrelevant.  systemd makes lip service to this, but one of its components, udev, does not at all.  It depends on whether you consider this a failure of udev, or a failure of systemd-because-it-absorbed-udev.<p><pre><code>         Myth: systemd doesn&#x27;t allow your to replace its components.\n</code></pre>\nMyth confirmed.  Go ahead.  Replace pid 1.<p><pre><code>         Myth: systemd&#x27;s use of D-Bus instead of sockets makes it intransparent.\n</code></pre>\nMyth disingenuous.  It doesn&#x27;t &quot;make it intransparent&quot;, it&#x27;s just stupid.  The creator goes on to pretend that d-bus serialization is in any way standardized (it is not, and never has been).  <i>systemd</i> may use it consistently, but that means nothing, because systemd has no specifications whatsoever.",1413767709

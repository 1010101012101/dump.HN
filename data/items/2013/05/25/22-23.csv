Do you let them own an open source printer again and let them use it without restriction?</i><p>According to one of the extra features on a well-known activist documentary about health care, in Norway a man convicted of murdering his family with a chainsaw was rehabilitated in part by employing him as a (well-supervised) logger, presumably to ensure his mind is well-trained in correct and incorrect uses of chainsaws.<p>So ""serve the prison sentence"" is the wrong way to look at it.  Instead we should be saying, ""After they've been rehabilitated and reintegrated into society,"" with the focus on rehabilitation to prevent recidivism, rather than retribution to satisfy our primitive lust for revenge.",1369522778

I don't think it's so much a hard cut off.  The 'freedom' difference between being dependent on family for rent and being able to support yourself is larger, in my opinion, than the freedom difference between owning your home and owning a block of apartments.<p>In my mind, if you can make a programmers wage, and you feel like you can easily get another job if fired?  you have a pretty large degree of freedom.<p>I also think that 'job security'  or, perhaps 'perceived income security' has as much to do with this freedom as does the amount you earn.   If you feel like your boss can fire you at any time, and if you feel like you can't easily get a new job?   you... are going to feel rather less free than someone who either thinks they can get another job fairly easily or who feels that they can't be fired.",1369522614

My autonomy of work and schedule. I  left mongocorp and went to worked at a start up with great/smart people for the past year. I  recently left the start up to scratch my own itch. I lived pretty frugal even while being employed by the super corps, so I have enough saved to last me at least a year or so.<p>The past 4 months of my corporate sabbatical/""start up"" has been one of the happiest times of my life. I'm learning the technologies I WANT to learn by applying them to solving real problems in my (still in stealth mode) product . When I see my past early twenties colleagues posting the "" time of my life"" weekend pics to the social networksphere, I laugh inside. I see past the  distractions they engage in to make themselves feel like they've made it  because, I remember the conversations we had daily about how much we hated the low quality work, stale tooling, and sometime poisonous corporate enviorments in which we worked.<p>I have no kids (I do have a dog that eats better then some people) and am only responsible for my self right now.

5769178,comment,5767414,5767414,2,0,kfcm,,,"After nearly 25 years, I've worked in almost every known office layout.  My opinions, based solely on my subjective experience:<p>--open-plan offices can work great for small teams of maybe 4-6 max.  Beyond five or six people though, productivity starts to drop significantly.  Also, the people on the team have to like each other, be working on the same problem/goal, and have a comfortable environment (whiteboards, comfy armchairs/sofa, big table and comfy chairs, natural lighting through large windows).  For a small, driven team, this is great.<p>--private offices are my preferred choice for a larger, established organization.  I want to be able to shut my door and work without the distractions of everyday office life invading my consciousness.  I can focus when needed, be social when I want.  More important, I can have my own private whiteboard.<p>--cubicles are almost, but not quite, entirely unlike tea in that you get the illusion of privacy (but not really) along with the illusion of an open-plan (but not really).<p>--work from home/home office.  For the past 5 years, this is how I've worked with my own business.  I like the privacy and the ability to get stuff done.  But I miss socializing and brainstorming with others, and am finding myself in coffee shops more and more often, just for the social aspects.<p>One concept I'd like to experiment with is a hybrid ""enclave"" model, where larger private offices/rooms are set up for teams working on projects, or just people who like to work together.  Maybe an external wall could open or close instead of a door if the team decides to be more social or focused.",1369522285

And certainly, that can be more important than money; but I'm pretty much the only one here that wouldn't be in trouble if our parental safety net went away, and that's kindof a big thing, I think.<p>so yeah.  it's quite possible my siblings are happier than I am.  I don't know, but I am fairly certain that they would be happier than they are now if they had more money (or rather, had more independent earning power.)<p>I mean, sure, money doesn't buy happiness... but, at least until you have 'enough'?   it makes a pretty big difference;   I've had 'enough' I think, by that standard, pretty much  since I reached the age of majority, and it gives me a huge degree of freedom that my siblings mostly don't have.<p>(that said, <i>I</i> probably would be a lot happier if I focused less on money and more on the other stuff.  I mean, right now I'm putting a lot of effort into running a business when I could live fairly well just contracting for other people maybe one third of the time, and instead focus on other things.)",1369522271

That time would be much better spent learning about fundamental knowledge such as algorithm design rather than learning about a specific tool that could be obsolete by the time the student graduates.

Just thought I'd share a few pointers:<p>- participating in SRMs is great practice for interviews because you're forced to learn to think clearly while under intense time pressure.<p>- The TopCoder tutorials are a great resource. In addition to review of useful mathematics, data structures and algorithms they'll give you an introduction into how to participate well. For example time management between the easy, medium and hard problems.<p>- You have four language choices for SRMs. My preference is C#. I like using Visual Studio because the auto-complete/intellisense comes in handy when you have to write a bit of boilerplate code (like ""new Dictionary<int, int>();"". I've also used MonoDevelop on OS X. It worked well. iirc almost all problems are solveable using C# except a few where, to my knowledge, C++ was necessary. Read-up on Petr's advice. I believe he's a fan of C#.<p>- My knowledge of C# isn't particularly deep so don't let learning a new language scare you away. imo you just have to effectively use dynamic arrays (List<T>), hashtables (Dictionary<Tkey, TValue>), static arrays and strings. Also a sorted key-value store like SortedDictionary comes in handy once in a while.<p>- Last bit of advice: solve lots of problems and have fun!

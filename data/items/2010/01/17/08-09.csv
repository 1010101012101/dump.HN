(They're pretty evenly divided between atheism and evolutionary biology. If it's first published before 2000, it's probably the latter.

You said this happened at 3:30 on April 12, but the camp's log says it happened at 3:42! Therefore <i>the entire Holocaust never happened and was made up by the Jewish banking conspiracy!</i>""<p>It's not any prettier when it's used to argue against climate change.",1263718469
1058238,comment,1058196,1058196,0,0,macnod,,,"According to this person, KWrite is better than Emacs and Emacs is a bug. In my opinion, this makes his post a little less credible. The rules that he suggests we all learn for how to use tabs and spaces in a file are helpful, but only when you're forced to use tabs. Otherwise, using spaces is always easier when you have to share your code with people that are not required to use KWrite.",1263718356

1058235,comment,1057736,1058226,0,0,tel,,,"Good call. I agree in disagreeing with his type for 'keep'. I think he was aiming at the idea of ""any computation which is liftable to an IO computation"" instead of ""computation which can be evaluated within an IO context"".<p>In my opinion, since 'keep' takes a function which is, in general, fully capable of any effectful action, it necessarily is of the type<p><pre><code>  keep :: IO a -> ...\n</code></pre>\nbut since it's roughly ignoring any potential return 'a', yet still evaluating the function repeatedly, the best type is something like<p><pre><code>  keep :: IO a -> IO [()]</code></pre>",1263717982

1058230,comment,1056116,1057808,0,0,rbanffy,,,"You have an impressive reputation, but, still, you fail to grasp a simple point of logic. You said shipping perfect software is impossible. To disprove you, all I have to do Is to show a single example of a perfect program. Many simple programs you use every day of your life certainly fall into this category. Maybe we got overly ambitious with our building blocks. Maybe we made it a job harder than it could be. You say you always find something. Maybe that's because you only look where you know you'll do.<p>I am not against security reviews. Quite the contrary. What I am saying is that you made a very impressive statement you can't possibly prove. There is software that does exactly what it's intended to do with no side effects, no bugs and that lives in a spacesecurity flaws are non-existant.<p>You fail to understand not all software is as complex as, say, a JVM. I am pretty sure you would haves hard time finding a flaw in, just to make a very simple example, the code that runs my coffee machine or that calculates my car's mileage. A security expert that claims it's impossible to write perfect software is nothing but arrogant and self-serving.<p>So, if you want to say it's impossible to have perfect software, please, prove it.",1263717498

1058222,comment,1057133,1057133,0,0,jlesk,,,"I deal with this every day, since I run a community of opinionated teenage band geeks, which can be worse than any technical forum I've seen.<p>My approach is that if you want the community to grow in the right direction, you have to keep pruning the bad stuff. So my main tool has been ruthless deletion.  There's no convoluted point system to distract from the conversation with endless tweaking, meta-discussion, and arguments about being downvoted.<p>There is also one big ban button for the mods -- no reputation or warning system.  I just rely on their judgment.  We have occasionally banned new members just for having terrible attitudes.  Sometimes we try to talk it out first, but often it's not worth the time.  Maybe this only applies to younger users, but I've found that you have to toss out the bad apples as early as possible, because their attitudes will spread.<p>As a result, I've been called a dictator a few times (justifiably), and there have been a few bruised egos, but everyone else raves about how great the community is.  Right now there is a civil discussion about Opera vs Broadway, and a thread with over 100 posts giving kudos to one another about their accomplishments, which was started by a regular user, not me.<p>Many banned members apologize and beg to be let back in, but I have learned to say no, because they relapse.  Some have even threatened me, but I would rather have those people complaining loudly about how much of a jerk I am, than to have my best members silently leave because the site has gone downhill (though some people will say that no matter what you do).<p>Anyway, maybe that approach won't work in a place like this, but I believe that if you have a strong opinion about how a community should behave, don't screw around trying to be ""fair"" or clever.  Just pick a bunch of people that share the same opinion and let them aggressively prune the bad stuff.",1263716771

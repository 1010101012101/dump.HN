And case-sensitivity is just bad UX for the 99% of computer users who aren&#x27;t programmers or IT; perhaps it makes sense on Linux but Windows and OS X are dealing with a different audience and Linus&#x27;s failure to give that fact some credit makes him come across as tone deaf.",1421168396

A muslim who lets others practice their religion believes that he is tolerant of those religions.

8880986,comment,8877737,8878613,0,0,orasis,,,"A totally normal part of insight meditation is to cycle through states of mind that have <i>increased</i> suffering.  They&#x27;re so common, that experienced meditators can pinpoint when they are entering into &quot;Fear&quot;, &quot;Misery&quot;, &quot;Disgust&quot;, &quot;Dissolution&quot;, &quot;Desire for Deliverence&quot;, etc.<p>It is these states of mind, where, if you can hold strong to the meditation instructions and objectify everything in the field of experience, the possibility for liberation from suffering arises.  When you realize that these experiences are just experiences arising and vanishing on their own, not things happening to &#x27;I&#x27;, there is an immediate relief from the suffering of those experiences.<p>From <a href=""http://alohadharma.com/2011/06/12/the-dark-night/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://alohadharma.com/2011/06/12/the-dark-night/</a><p>&quot;As the meditator moves along the path and has already experienced their attention syncing up with the arising of phenomena, then the peak of phenomena, it then moves to the passing away of phenomena. I call the next section of the path the “Dark Night” and in the commentaries it is also called “the knowledge of suffering.”<p>As you can gather from the name, this is a pretty difficult part of the path. It is so difficult in fact, this is where most meditators get into trouble, and can become stuck. The sheer discomfort and negativity of this part of the path may lead the meditator to conclude that they are no longer “doing it right,” and they may decide to just quit meditating. After all, why keep at it when it pretty much hurts to meditate? In the Zen tradition, this part of the path is called the “rolling up of the mat” for just that reason – the meditator just wants to throw in the towel and stop.<p>This actually makes a lot of sense if you do not know the map. The memory of the rapturous A&P is still fresh in the mind of a meditator who initially steps into the Dark Night. Compared to the joy and wonder that was only just experienced, the Dark Night is a horrible let down. But it is important to know that the difficulty being experienced is a sign of progress – it means that you are doing the meditation correctly.&quot;<p>So, the reason for the aloofness of the staff is partially because these phases are totally expected and normal, and unless you are having a true psychotic episode, the whole point is to push through.",1421168241

Even Monsanto&#x27;s &quot;Roundup Ready&quot; GMOs merely express a modified version of an enzyme that allows them to synthesize essential amino acids even in the presence of the pesticide. There is no rational argument for why modifications to the DNA region that regulate production of the enzyme or modifications to the enzyme could be dangerous in any way... Even when ingested, these macromolecules would be digested rather than absorbed, as in the case of a bioactive small molecule that is readily absorbed from consumer plastics (e.g. BPA).<p>FUD...",1421167729

The case sensitivity is implemented at a layer above the filesystem so that classic Windows apps will behave the way users expect. (Case sensitive filesystems are confusing for users and mostly create opportunities for horrible mishaps.) As a result, the POSIX subsystem can store case sensitive files just like a linux FS would, with &#x27;FOO&#x27; and &#x27;foo&#x27; being separate files right next to each other:<p><a href=""http://support.microsoft.com/kb/100625"" rel=""nofollow"">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/100625</a><p>Case insensitivity like win32&#x27;s is still kind of a mess, but it&#x27;s unfair to paint the developers of NTFS as idiots when they actually got this right.

8880926,comment,8878382,8879034,0,0,haberman,,,"> Zeroed memory should not be particularly expensive on modern machines, because we have a lot of parallelism available to zero it off working threads.<p>If your plan is to use other threads to zero the memory, then your malloc() implementation needs to move every freed region into a thread-safe queue to be zero&#x27;d and wait for the other thread to pick it up before the memory is eligible to be allocated again.  This adds synchronization costs, creates opportunities for false sharing, and introduces starvation issues.<p>Also, there are applications that genuinely peg all CPUs already.  In these cases, this approach makes even less sense because there is no spare CPU sitting around, so you pay the overhead for no actual parallelism.<p>> When software starts relying on things like overflow checks and zeroed memory, hardware manufacturers like Intel start building and optimizing hardware to make them faster.<p>I&#x27;m pretty sure Intel already has plenty of incentive to make memset(ptr, 0, n) fast.  Also I&#x27;m not sure how overflow checks could be made much faster, except maybe to create an entirely separate set of integer instructions that raise hardware exceptions on overflow.  Maybe that would be worthwhile, I don&#x27;t know.<p>> The &quot;prefer performance over correctness&quot; bias that&#x27;s existed in the C world has been responsible for a lot of damage. We need to get out of it.<p>The &quot;correctness checks are free because we want them to be&quot; bias that exists in other languages has been responsible for a lot of languages and runtimes that are &quot;nice&quot; but that no one could actually write a competitive web browser (for example) in.",1421167710

Were you contacted as &quot;I&#x27;m from Google and we are interested in you&quot;, or &quot;I&#x27;m from Google and we are interested in your product&quot;? That is a big difference.

Is it so surprising that when you &quot;click next to install program y&quot;, that program y is installed? Download.com doesn&#x27;t promise not to bundle software, it promises not to install bundled software without the user&#x27;s consent, which is obscured in this demo. I&#x27;m not saying that Download.com is doing the right thing; <i>I&#x27;m saying that this article is failing to isolate where the problem really is.</i><p>Furthermore, they complain about things that aren&#x27;t related to Download.com at all. For example, they install YAC and then complain that YAC is installed and working as advertised. Again, it obscures the actual investigation. Consider that this isn&#x27;t Download.com&#x27;s recommended apps; it&#x27;s simply the most downloaded applications. Just because a lot of people download something isn&#x27;t an assurance that it does something useful. Go to the Editor&#x27;s Picks for that, which includes many useful and clean programs. Or even the Top Downloads of all time, rather than Last Week.<p>By obscuring the results of the demo and failing to distinguish between things that should happen and things that shouldn&#x27;t, HTG makes it harder for us intelligently discuss the Download.com ecosystem. They fail to educate users about bundled software and how to avoid it. Instead, we&#x27;re just regurgitating vague opinions that the Windows ecosystem is terrible.<p>The title should read something more like &quot;What happens when you blindly install applications a lot of other people installed&quot; which makes it much easier to discuss whether Download.com is really at fault here, or who/what is.

You disagree with them, based on your evidence. Now, your evidence is evolving and is incomplete. In fact, scientific evidence has been overturned by more evidence. There have even been cases wherein the Bible was presumed wrong, but later corroborated by archaeological evidence. The state of science hadn&#x27;t yet caught up to the reality that the Bible had already documented.<p>And, suffice it to say, there are many scientists who, at a certain point, draw the conclusion that there is some sort of intelligent design behind our universe. Their belief is derived in full weight of and respect for the scientific evidence. There are also fundamental, observable laws of physics that must be broken in order to accommodate a spontaneous eruption of the universe. That is, accepted science contradicts itself. In some cases, the science is predicated upon assumptions that cannot yet be proven. That is, there is a measure of something akin to faith involved.<p>All of this to say that taking a position of assuredness in one&#x27;s belief in something in the face of incomplete knowledge is the same, irrespective of some subjective measure of &quot;degree of evidence&quot; that one side or the other would like to impose. Your certainty that they are wrong is exactly as valid as their certainty that they are right.<p>Likewise, subjecting to ridicule those whose beliefs don&#x27;t align with your own is short-sighted and destructive on either side.<p>In my opinion, the scientist&#x27;s mind remains open until conclusive proof is in. Now, you may choose not to believe in Islam or Christianity, etc. because you have no proof of their truth. But, the most you can say about them is there&#x27;s not enough evidence to convince you. You simply cannot conclude that they are wrong if you are applying those same &quot;laws&quot; of evidence to which you subscribe.",1421166684

The Qur&#x27;an encourages violence. The faces of organized Islam in the west engage in apologetics and argue that this isn&#x27;t so, but anyone can read this for themselves. Claiming that the Qur&#x27;an doesn&#x27;t encourage violence is just doublethink. Most Muslims believe that the Qur&#x27;an espouses peace, only because they haven&#x27;t read it. But if they actually do read it and realize it espouses violence, then they are faced with a choice: either give up the idea that the Qur&#x27;an is inerrant, or begin spreading Islam through violence. All it takes to turn a peaceful Muslim into a violent Muslim is that they actually read and understand their holy book.<p>Even peaceful Muslims aren&#x27;t great. Even in its milder incarnations, Islam is sexist and hostile to science.<p>The interests of Islam are not aligned with my interests. They are, in fact, directly opposed to my interests.<p>I believe that one of the most powerful ways in which I can act politically is through economics. There is a diner in my town which is well-known for its owners being racist. I don&#x27;t go there, because I don&#x27;t want to support racists monetarily. Similarly, I wouldn&#x27;t hire a person who made racist comments. I believe that there should be significant repercussions for that kind of behavior.<p>Likewise, I don&#x27;t want to go to Muslim businesses or hire Muslims. Islam is every bit as harmful as racism, and I believe that there should be significant repercussions for that behavior.<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protected_class"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protected_class</a>",1421166593

8880766,comment,8877812,8878190,0,0,VLM,,,"I can try to provide a (late) serious, long-ish response.<p>First of all there is no &quot;the plastic atom&quot; they are chemically more diverse than anything in computer-land.  So the concerns of polycarb plastics have no relationship with polyethylene or teflon or whatever other than coincidentally having been industrially developed around the same decades so people call them all plastics, although its actually worse than calling anything green a plant and assuming they&#x27;re all the same.<p>Here&#x27;s your analogy:  Plastics are tangled up strings.  Like a crazy nanoscale 3-d composite.  The strings are mfgr in place by dumping a bunch of wanna-be string pieces and crazy reactive hyperactive catalyst in a form and then waiting, maybe heating, to convince the catalyst to bond wanna-be string chunks into a long string.<p>The mechanism or turning pieces of string into a long string is surprisingly common and boring, which is the source of the whole problem.  You have a chunky molecule with a finger or whatever sticking out containing a double bond.  Just a plain old boring double bond like you&#x27;d find all over the place, like unfortunately in your innards.  The crazy catalyst has the unusual ability to snap open double bonds and fall off to repeat maybe a few thousand times.  Then the opened double bonds sometimes snap right shut, but sometimes grab a neighbor.<p>Think of a clown car with 20 people squashed into it, clasping their left and right hand together, and &quot;magically&quot; their hands unclasp for a moment, maybe, and due to crowding, their hands snap shut on a neighbors hand instead of their own.  Now instead of having 20 separate clowns in a clown car, you got a conga line of 20 attached clowns wedged into place and you can&#x27;t remove just one anymore because they&#x27;re all stuck together.  They&#x27;ve polymerized into a car shaped brick with a molecular weight of about 20 clowns.  So now you know why some plastics are industrially sold based on molecular weight.<p>The &quot;trick&quot; to making plastics is making a shelf stable substance, preferably liquid-ish, that won&#x27;t spontaneously polymerize, but has crazy molecule sex with all its neighbors at the drop of a catalyst hat.  The catalyst is like a little monster than hands out to everyone little molecule-condoms coated with superglue instead of lube. (don&#x27;t take this all literally, but figuratively it kinda works)  Its actually quite tricky chemistry which is why it took till the last century to really kick off plastic production &quot;for real&quot; rather than just screwing around.<p>Plastics stereotypically, on average across the field, are super boring biochemically.  Pure polyethylene is about as chemically exciting and reactive as asphalt, for example.  Probably because it vaguely resembles asphalt chemically, you can make synthetic oil out of little bits, and polyethylene is close to what synthetic asphalt would look like.  Kinda.  Unpolymerized polyethylene is just a simple flammable gas, a very close cousin of propane / butane.  The reason why nobody owns a ethylene cigarette lighter or has an ethylene grill in their backyard to grill burgers is it all goes into plastics not lighters and grills...  So the world is full of really boring plastics.  But not all plastics are boring.<p>Unfortunately, BPA makes a totally awesome and non-biologically reactive plastic once it cures and links up to the neighbors in a big chunk, but by itself, uncured, its fairly nasty stuff.  It really wants to grab hold of another molecule, which is awesome if it successfully grabs hold and never lets go of another BPA molecule, but kinda bad if it mistakenly grabs onto your DNA (or whatever) like a bear trap.<p>There are also interesting &quot;green&quot; implications such that if BPA based plastics ever decay, its just like dumping a tanker car of monomer out in the landfill.  Kinda nasty if it ever happens.  On the other hand, never breaking down is kind of ecologically nasty too.  Generally speaking the &quot;green&quot; plastics like PLA or PE have non-toxic monomers and are not nearly as durable as the &quot;non-green&quot; plastics like polycarb family, speaking generally, etc.",1421166346

8880746,comment,8879201,8879851,0,0,gavanwoolery,,,"Nope, not related (other than the fact that it uses voxels :) ).  As other people mentioned, a voxel is sort of a 3D pixel (VO-lumetric pi-XEL) - it is just a way of representing a particle of data in 3-space (how it is represented and how it is rendered is really up to the programmer).<p>Minecraft is a voxel game, although there is much (heated) debate over what constitutes a voxel.  The main contention with Minecraft is that, while the data is voxel-based at a macroscopic level, each cube contains texture maps (texture-mapped polygons, to be precise), which &quot;violates&quot; the idea of a &quot;pure&quot; voxel (personally I could care less, I&#x27;m only specifying what people are debating about).  A &quot;pure&quot; voxel being the smallest element of data for visual representation, usually with only one color associated with it (as with a pixel). Some people call Minecraft-style voxels &quot;boxels&quot; - although I once did this and suffered the wrath of the internet.<p>In my opinion, there is nothing inherently interesting about voxels.  There are a few things that they are well suited for which makes them interesting though:<p>1) Simplest way to build 3D objects, akin to working with Legos.  Even four year olds play Minecraft. At a higher voxel resolution, it is like working with clay.  Voxels don&#x27;t suffer from many issues polygons do: overlapping polygons, wrong directional vector or point winding, gaps in the mesh, a corrupted mesh (i.e. twisting a limb too much and making the polygons overlap), and more.<p>2) Closely associated with pixel art, which has a unique aesthetic appeal. In many cases, voxel art is designed to be low res / chunk, such that it is &quot;timeless&quot; - just like pixel art. Polygons are usually not regarded as this, but there is a new movement with low-poly art that I think could be considered equally &quot;timeless&quot;<p>3) In my case, why I chose to work with them: they are a godsend when it comes to procedural generation (algorithmically generating assets).  This is because it is much easier to describe an object point by point, volumetrically, as opposed to describing just the surface of the object (anyone who does not believe me, write a 3D Voronoi generator with polygons, then with voxels :) ).  It is not necessarily more computationally efficient, but it is definitely easier to program.  Working with voxels is almost like working with a 3D graphing calculator - you feed in a world position at a given point, it spits out the results of whatever equations you want to run at that point. The difference being with polygons is that you must carefully choose a set of points in the world that fall on the surface of the mesh, and then correctly generate triangles to cover that mesh, normals to describe the faces, and texture coordinates to describe how textures should be applied to the polygons.<p>Anyhow, this looks like a cool little project.  Looks like maybe it is doing volume rendering similar to Voxatron?",1421166128

Nor was it in any way directly responsible for that.<p>Credit belongs to the Islamic world for keeping classical knowledge alive and reintroducing it to Europe at the beginning of the Renaissance.  However the Enlightenment refers to a later period in European history where people came to terms with the result of decades of very nasty civil wars over Protestant vs Catholic, and came up with principles which allowed people of different beliefs to peacefully coexist within society.<p>That is the source of Western ideas like &quot;freedom of religion&quot; and &quot;freedom of speech&quot;.

But their teachings are very explicit that this only works so long as you don&#x27;t do anything offensive to muslims.  Like mock the prophet, convert muslims to your faith, and so on.  Do that, and you die.  Unless the Muslim world internalizes the Western version of that idea, we&#x27;re going to continue having problems reconciling Islam and Western civilization.<p>Incidentally the golden age of Islam that you refer to traditionally ended with the sack of Baghdad in 1258.

I travelled around for a fortnight.<p>I completely disagree. It was an almost entirely patriarchal society. I can&#x27;t even begin to comprehend how you came to any other conclusion. The dominance of men in positions of authority and in the social life of all the cities I visited, including Damascus and Aleppo, was overwhelming and blindingly obvious.<p>For example, how many women did you see in cafes without male escorts? How many officials did you interact with who were female? How many times did you see women shopping alone in Souks? I think my answer to that is &quot;pretty much zero&quot;.<p>Damascus was definitely much more liberal than other places. I don&#x27;t recall the same being true of Aleppo.<p>I agree, however, that the poverty wasn&#x27;t too bad, compared to other countries.<p>Popular support for Al-Assad was complicated.

There are many complaints about those who point fingers at all Muslims when these things happen, something which would be easily defused by a fatwa (a legal opinion) from some high-placed muftis declaring such acts as &#x27;haram&#x27; - sinful. I do not know enough about Islam to know whether there is something resembling &#x27;excommunication&#x27; in the Roman Catholic church, but if there is it would make sense to apply it to those who commit such acts of violence. If the perpetrators can no longer claim to be defending their religion they might start to realise that their acts of violence are criminal acts, pure and simple, without any religious excuse.<p>Such a fatwa - or series of fatwas, as there are many currents in Islam - would take away the cause for the general blame which is aimed at Muslims when atrocities are performed in name of their religion.",1421165098

Closing stdout means that the program opens a file and it gets file handle 1 instead of a higher number.  Then it writes something to stdout, which is an alias for file handle 1, but instead it writes to the opened file.<p>I believe this caused some security bugs in passwd or maybe su where you could run it without stderr and &quot;Password:&quot; would be written to the passwd file instead of stderr.  ...but these specifics are beside the point, which is that it is next to impossible to anticipate the problems an unhandled error can create.<p>Java&#x27;s checked exceptions can be annoying when you have to add some extra &quot;throws X&quot; or handle every case, but my experience is that I never had the slightest doubt over how a method could fail or what needed to be done to handle errors.  For unchecked exceptions maybe you have a point, although their failure mode for unhandled errors is still to abort the program rather than to continue on with undefined behavior as in Go.",1421164984

8002298,comment,7996950,8002025,1,0,lisper,,,"&quot;Subjective&quot; means &quot;based on or influenced by personal feelings, tastes, or opinions.&quot;  Whether or not the choice of theories is subjective on this definition depends on whether or not you care about the truth.  Consider:<p>Proposition P: Anthropogenic climate change is a myth.<p>Suppose I subjectively choose a Bayesian prior for proposition P to be very close to 1.  I can turn the crank on that and come up with models that are consistent with all the available data.  Of course, this will lead me to conclusions that some would consider bizarre (&quot;conspiracy theory&quot; is the pejorative term) but because my feelings, tastes and opinions are just as valid as anyone else&#x27;s (qua opinions) there is no subjective basis for preferring or rejecting my conclusions.  But, of course, there is an <i>objective</i> basis for rejecting my theory because it has more explanatory loose ends than a theory that doesn&#x27;t have to invoke conspiracies.<p>Perhaps you want to use subjectivity to choose among theories which are objectively &quot;equivalent&quot; in some sense, i.e. similar explanatory power, agreement with the data, etc.  There&#x27;s nothing preventing you from doing that, but what would be the point?  The best you can say objectively is that there is no basis for preferring one theory over another and there&#x27;s more work left to be done (c.f. string theory).  You could pick one theory over another because you think it&#x27;s &quot;prettier&quot; but so what?  If there was anything actually to be gained then (again, by definition) you could have made the selection objectively, not subjectively.",1404777502

It&#x27;s something that money literally cannot buy, and much harder to create than than cash in one&#x27;s bank account.<p>And as for control, maybe I should just say it explicitly: we have raised investment but are still in full control of the company (aside: it&#x27;d be nuts if we weren&#x27;t at the stage), and plan to keep it that way going forward. In fact, our investors decided to invest <i>explicitly</i> because they believe our team is the best able to make decisions on growing a sustainable business and solving the developer platform challenges. No matter how good the VC, they obviously don&#x27;t have the background+skills+focus to design APIs (and likewise shouldn&#x27;t).<p>One of our investors likes to say, &quot;We&#x27;re in your corner, but not in your kitchen,&quot; which I&#x27;ve always thought framed the relationship well. I know there&#x27;s lots of cynicism in the tech world with buyouts/acqui-hires and swarmy VCs, so I can understand where this reaction comes from. And unfortunately I don&#x27;t have a solid rebuttal other than saying &quot;trust me&quot; with the test of time. Clearly that doesn&#x27;t work for the HN skeptics. :/<p>It&#x27;s also worth pointing out that not <i>all</i> acquisitions are terrible. Google Docs came from an acquisition. So did Google Earth. Facebook continues to run Parse, and Instagram, and Beluga via FB Messenger. Sometimes these acquisitions legitimately make sense, but I think the important thing is keeping the right people in positions to make those decisions when the time comes, and not the people who are just looking for the immediate financial return.",1404777433

I&#x27;m a bit short on time right now, but I will convert some parts of this response into more coherent form and edit my article accordingly to clarify.<p>I&#x27;ll address each of your paragraphs in turn:<p>1.) Re: CS0 vs. CS1. Like you mentioned, I was very upfront about the methodology for this analysis. And I am very aware that most CS majors do not ever take a CS0 course. But please also be aware that there are a minority of CS majors that <i>do</i> take CS0 before moving onto CS1, usually because they feel ill-equipped to take CS1 right away. I harp on this point because even though this is a minority population, it&#x27;s a <i>very important</i> one since those are students who, without CS0, would not major in CS. These students are more likely to be female or from underrepresented minority groups. On a related note, a larger and larger fraction of non-CS majors are taking CS courses because they recognize the value of programming and computational thinking. (Again, these non-CS majors are more likely to be female and from underrepresented minority groups.) So I would argue that CS0 is just as important as an &quot;introductory programming&quot; course as CS1, if not more important, due to the rise of the non-software-engineers-who-want-to-learn-programming population. [Edit: And I think that a CS department&#x27;s choice of language to offer to the CS0 student population is still very significant, and a decision that is not made hastily.]<p>2.) Re: Python CS0 and Java CS1. You are absolutely right, and in my original article, this sentence appears in the discussion section: <i>&quot;Some schools have fully switched over to Python, while others take a hybrid approach, offering Python in CS0 and keeping Java in CS1.&quot;</i><p>3.) Re: AP exams using Java. Thanks for the clarification. I will remove &quot;it&#x27;s unclear whether that will change anytime soon.&quot; from the article.<p>[Also, as to cyorir&#x27;s comment that <i>the chosen data may have been cherry-picked</i>, please rest assured that I tried my best NOT to cherry pick. If I had cherry picked, wouldn&#x27;t I have made Python look even better? ;) Any incomplete data is strictly due to human error or oversight on my part, and I gladly welcome any correction requests via email.]",1404777256

8002237,comment,8000650,8000650,2,0,peatmoss,,,"Depending on what your interest in transportation engineering is, you may find yourself pretty disappointed. I can probably opine a little on this based on my background. I did primarily unix systems and security for the better part of a decade before getting a masters in urban planning, spending a few years working for a metropolitan planning organization including in their travel modeling group (these are usually the major public sector transportation modeling agencies due to federal requirements), and am now back in school working on a PhD in planning. I&#x27;m going to give you the traditionalist&#x27;s view here, which may look a little drab / discouraging.<p>If you want to &quot;fix traffic&quot; I highly recommend running away now. You will not fix traffic as transportation modeler (I assume transportation modeling is what you mean by traffic simulation). The state of the art in travel modeling is not good enough that obvious solutions present themselves very often. Even when obvious solutions to some narrowly-constrained problem <i>do</i> present themselves, model results are usually one data point for consideration in a delicate dance between bureaucrats, politicians, and a general public with diverse and competing interests. You will also find yourself very poorly compensated compared to your peers who graduated in CS.<p>Another thing to keep in mind walking into anything transportation related (private or public sector), is that you are going to have a big ramp-up on domain knowledge / will start at the bottom of a low-paying totem pole. In my group in a public agency, we had a handful of people with PhDs, lots with masters, and I&#x27;m struggling to think of one person with a bachelors. And to be clear, a masters degree in civil engineering, planning, or public affairs qualified you for an entry level (assistant) position or maybe an associate level if you had some decent experience on top. I don&#x27;t bring this up because I&#x27;m under the delusion that degrees make the person, but do beware that you&#x27;re likely to run up against some biases if not hard degree requirements. In terms of domain knowledge, the transportation research board (TRB) is one of the national academies of science. I&#x27;m not sure the best scholarship always happens in this domain, but I bring this up to say that there&#x27;s lots to learn... Also, transportation modeling is a very stats-heavy domain. Getting into the guts of transportation models is likely to require more than a passing familiarity with graduate level statistical methods.<p>In the public sector, the MPO I worked for was actually developing its own next generation travel modeling package, but opportunities in the public sector for that are as rare. The public sector has been running so-called &quot;trip-based models&quot; for decades. The software for these has been an off-the-shelf affair for some time, with actual model runs set up through either through monotonous clickety-click or ghastly macro language by intern-level positions guided by more senior modeling staff. Activity-based models are the next generation, and are being tested out by more ambitious agencies now. Once the benefits of these new models are proven out, smaller MPOs and city planning offices will likely adopt them. However, I don&#x27;t see the the second wave hiring in-house coders--they&#x27;ll wait until they can get an off-the-shelf package (or if there is justice in the universe, some usable open source version). I mention this because, despite the breakneck pace at which academia produces new and novel statistical and modeling techniques, consumers of these models are crazy slow at adopting new model types. This obviously has implications for what kinds of coding jobs exist.<p>You might find an in as a coder for a company that writes one of the major existing travel modeling software packages, but my understanding talking to them, is that they tend to be fairly small operations and have coders who also tend to have some domain expertise in travel modeling. I could imagine them hiring a straight-up coder, but breaking into the subject matter might be hard, as you could very easily end up doing pretty generic coding tasks with little relation to traffic engineering.<p>Reading through this, I&#x27;m realizing I sound pretty discouraging. If you constrain yourself to transportation modeling, which is what I assume you meant by traffic simulation, you may find yourself disappointed by the opportunities. This is the boring traditional world of transportation modeling. If you&#x27;re willing to look outside transportation modeling, you may find some more interesting transportation-related coding jobs that are friendlier to people with more of a coding / entrepreneurial bent. Particularly in the startup space. I think there&#x27;s still plenty of greenfield left for people wanting to sensor-up the city, ferry those data around, and then make sense of it all.",1404776383

The current cleanup at Fukushima relates mostly to the flow of contaminated ground water directly in the vicinity of the plant, as well as the problem of finding out where to send waste currently stored on site. Airborne radiation is currently not so much of a problem. Even when airborne radiation was a problem, wind patterns tend to carry the contaminated air east, across the Pacific, rather than inland.<p>So ongoing radiation would not be expected to cause major concerns with Fujitsu&#x27;s relatively removed work. Residual radiation and contamination of the soil used could pose problems, but I do not think they will. Given how low they have gotten the potassium levels, I expect that control over the growing environment and soil will is quite high.",1404775501

Studying SOLID principles, application boundaries, encapsulation, etc. only makes sense <i>within the context of a working application</i>. Not only that, but making sense of design decisions is not as easy as &quot;seeing the result&quot; like you can in a drawing.

8002173,comment,8001337,8001968,3,0,klodolph,,,"I think the intense focus on OOP is a problem, and it is symptomatic of teaching students Java as their first language.  Just as if you learn BASIC first you love GOTO, if you learn Java first you love classes and think everything should be a class.  What especially concerns me is that some people are interested in whether a program or language is object-oriented, and endeavor to make their programs more object-oriented.  Object-oriented programming is a design aesthetic, perhaps one of the most nebulous design aesthetics, and it should not be considered a goal or a dogma but rather a source of inspiration for design.  Java is a particularly bad example because Java&#x27;s brand of OOP conflates encapsulation, data structures, and polymorphism.  The languages we&#x27;ll be seeing in the 2020s and beyond will probably be more sensible about these things.  Look at the new languages with the most mind share these days (Go, Rust, Swift) if you want an idea of where the wind is blowing.<p>The other problem is that the farther you get from being a freshman, the farther you get from understanding which concepts are necessary in an introductory curriculum.  As a senior you might say that OOP must be taught to the freshmen because so many freshmen don&#x27;t get it, as a junior developer you might want the program to teach the standard library, and as a senior developer you might want to teach people about testing.  This is all wrong.  The most important things to teach freshmen CS students are very simple.  Control structures, data structures, references / pointers, and recursion.  Never forget that while OOP is warm and fuzzy and makes you feel good, the number one priority of the intro CS courses is to get the freshmen to write programs that work correctly.<p>Or, since OOP is a design aesthetic, it is only useful once design becomes important.  Design is not important for small programs that freshmen write.  Let them get off the ground with correct programs, and teach them paradigms once they have enough context to understand them.",1404775261

Know enough PHP to receive the GET request, and then update a textfile of entries on disk.  Use a second file to store the top ten clicks.  Return the second text file.<p>Thats it.  In your example, you did what is generally expected of today&#x27;s current &quot;web trends&quot;: you take a super simple use case, and demand it be highly scalable for millions of users with instant and immediate feedback.  And why are we using CSS at all? Its a button and some text, no styling is needed.  And why are we using a database? Do you expect millions of concurrent users? Hundreds? Your requirements didn&#x27;t say that. What do you mean package/deploy/whatever to the server? Sure, there are some basic routing needs and maybe Apache, but those take minutes or less to setup. Also, right in the middle of your solution, you changed the requirement &quot;If I want the interface to update immediately...&quot;, right there, <i>you</i> are adding complexity.<p>While at the face of it, I understand what you are trying to say, but I have to point out that <i>you</i> are the primary cause of the increase of complexity, not the technologies involved.  I actually think deploying a simple counter website like this is easy.  But as soon as you want immediate feedback? Alright, more complexity.  Millions of stored records? Alright maybe some large memory cache, like Memcache (or a large array).  Persistent records? Alright, fine, get a DB.  Millions of <i>concurrent</i> users? Alright, we are going to need some more complexity to handle throttling. Thousands of requests per second? Even more complexity, maybe we have a distributed system.<p>In the end, you took a simple problem, and turned it into an awfully complex one.

8002108,comment,8001337,8001337,7,0,icambron,,,"I&#x27;ve always been of two minds about this. My intro course at MIT was in Scheme, a class that has since been renamed and is now taught using Python. On the one hand, it was a great course, and the FP was an awesome mindfuck (previous programming experience: TI BASIC). Though I took it all for granted at the time, it definitely set me up to think about programming better for years, and I still reread the book sometimes. The downside was that for a little bit, I couldn&#x27;t really program in anything really practical, because by 2001 Scheme kinda wasn&#x27;t. In other courses, I found myself crunching data with Perl that I only sort of understood, or writing C programs in situations where C probably wasn&#x27;t the ideal tool, because it was the only other language I really knew. The thing where people say &quot;once you know all the theory, you can learn a language in a couple days&quot; isn&#x27;t really true, and anyway, you probably don&#x27;t have that couple of days. Point to Python.<p>So the question is really: can you use Python to get most of the benefit of teaching using Scheme while at the same time giving the student a practical tool for future use? I haven&#x27;t taken the new Python courses, so I don&#x27;t know how well the material bends to the language, but I remain skeptical of the &quot;most of the benefit&quot; part. Maybe I&#x27;m just a curmudgeon, but I sort of think they should keep Scheme and then just have a short (e.g. over IAP) course on practical programming techniques using Python (or whatever). Or maybe someone should rewrite SICP in Clojure? Finally, I know Scheme has continued to evolve, and I wonder if it&#x27;s really still true that Racket is impractical as a day-to-day language.",1404774118

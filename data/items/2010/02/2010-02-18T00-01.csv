1133111,comment,1131664,1131664,0,0,InclinedPlane,,,"This review (at least it's admittedly unscientific) suffers from a common problem of many critiques of software development practices: a lack of appreciation for diversity. Software development spans a much wider range of conditions than almost any other human activity, scaling from a lone developer working part-time on a personal project up to teams of thousands of devs and testers working on billion dollar or perhaps even life-critical software.<p>Software development efforts can span 6 or more orders of magnitude difference, and can differ in character enormously (such as between a scheduled release cycle of unpatchable, life-critical software vs. a constantly updated web site). Yet despite this huge diversity, most commentators insist on ignoring it and giving blanket advice as if it were equally applicable to every development effort in the history of the Universe.<p>The various drawbacks and benefits of different source control tools will matter differently to teams of different scales and processes. For some teams SVN may make sense, for some it may not be even remotely feasible. I've heard of teams that could not use git because of scaling issues (shocking as that may sound).<p>It's hard to take advice seriously that doesn't acknowledge these issues. It's no different than someone talking about web infrastructure and saying that the best solution is php/apache and mysql running on two separate servers. That may be a fine solution, but it's overkill for some scenarios and unsuitable for a lot of other scenarios. Sometimes you need a thousand servers, sometimes you only need a single 128mb ram VPS, sometimes you need scala or erlang, sometimes you don't need anything more than static html, sometimes you need a REST backend, sometimes you don't, sometimes you need nosql, sometimes you don't. What works for amazon.com may not be applicable to a personal vanity page or to twitter or google or paypal.",1266454453

If you call printf(a1, a2, ... , an), it pushes n arguments, then the instruction pointer, then your locals. No clobbering necessary.<p>Maybe 1972-era C pushed arguments to the stack according to the signature defined in the function definition rather than the function call? (i.e. printf would have 10 pushes no matter how many arguments you actually passed to it). If it pushed according to the function signature, you'd waste memory and have a hard limit to how many arguments you could pass. And you'd waste push instructions. So I don't know why it's written the way it is, but corrupting your locals doesn't seem like a likely explanation. Maybe they're trying to mollify the compiler?",1266454075

1133087,comment,1132666,1132870,0,0,cameldrv,,,"I agree that those are the two likely possibilities.  Given that the pilot was pretty experienced, and was a multi-engine instructor, I'd say that disorientation is less likely.<p>On a cold day at sea level, the 310 should be able to get at least 200fpm.  The book number is about 300fpm.  However, they may not have been going fast enough to get book performance, and a plane that old usually can't make nearly the book numbers.  They hit at about .3nm from the end of the runway, significantly left of the extended centerline, and at an altitude of about 100 feet.  That would be consistent with a climb rate of about 150-200fpm.<p>My guess is that the left engine failed.  The left engine is the critical engine, and so the plane would have very strongly wanted to turn left.  It would have been slow having just taken off, and so the pilot probably had to turn to keep his speed up and maintain a positive climb rate.  He probably either forgot about the power lines, or was just hoping to clear them since he couldn't see them.<p>Sadly, this is probably just another instance of the second engine being just enough to get you to the scene of the crash.",1266453935

Take a look at the first heads up hand:<p>Small blind (opponent) gets dealt Ace-Four, a very strong heads up hand, because ace-high will be good lots of time heads up.

Ten-two is junk. Anyway, a good heads-up player will probably raise Ace-four 3-5 times the value of the pot.<p>Okay, so then the board comes down 989 on the flop. At this point, opponent has ace high on a pair of nines. He's feeling quite good. He probably bets out, maybe half the pot.

You can work offline. On centralized, trivial decisions can't be taken because they pollute the central repository and leads to bad practices. Creating branches is not the main issue, merging FAST is. Git performs/scales well, 22K files on the Linux kernel repo, about 4 merges a day for 2 years since being tracked with Git. Mercurial is good, but Git is better. Git uses SHA-1 hashes for the full history, brings security against attacks and RAM/disk corruption.",1266452373

And honest, in software development, a large amount of your data is going to be well-defined and easily normalized.  The author provided 2 examples that would fit perfectly in a relational database.<p><i>> The type of queries you will be running on the data is largely unknown up front.</i><p>Or the types of queries you are running are more than just retrieving a single record or simple list of records.  I'm afraid a very large number of queries fall into this category.<p><i>> The data is long-lived: it will be written once, updated infrequently relative to the number of reads/queries, and deleted either never, or many years in the future.</i><p>Yes, a relational databases are for storing long-lived data.  For temporary data, you could use an in-memory table or just some other solution entirely.  There's no need to mix your permanent data with your temporary data.  Databases handle writes and deletes extremely well (in bulk even) so I'm not sure what the author was getting at here.<p><i>> The database does not need round-the-clock availability (middle-of-the-night maintenance windows are no problem).</i><p>What kind of middle-of-the-night maintenance does a relational database need?  I've been running at least one database for several years straight without any downtime or maintenance.<p><i>> Queries do not need to be particularly fast, they just need to return correct results eventually.</i><p>Relational database queries aren't particularly slow -- in fact, RBMS are heavily optimized to return data very quickly. In the vast majority of cases, this is going to be more than fast enough for nearly every application.<p><i>> Data integrity is 100% paramount, trumping all other concerns, such as performance and scalability.</i><p>Damn straight.  I want the data coming from my data store to be 100% correct always.  If I need to trade performance for correctness then I can easily add some caching.  But I'm not sure how document stores would solve this any differently.",1266452033

Don't know if many readers here are also pilots, but it's always sad to see something like this happen to a fellow aviator.
I've flown 310's quite a bit and they can be a handful on a single engine - although I will refrain from speculating about the crash further.
Incidentally it's possible to track the investigation using the NTSB website:

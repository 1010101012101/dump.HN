I'm not surprised they occasionally want to ""waste their academic offerings"" on billionaire's children with middling resumes.  The situation is much better than in years past, but you'll never escape it.<p>Quite simply, Harvard didn't come by that $35 billion endowment on the basis of SAT scores alone.  Everyone else in that stratus has to compete with that figure as well.  This is simply an economic problem, compounded by wealth concentration.  Who's going to make a college turn down a potential huge bequest in return for a handful of slightly-less-meritorious admissions?  They can admit everyone alphabetically if they want to.<p>If anyone you know is surprised by this, tell them that you just found out that politicians listen to the people who write the biggest checks instead of the people who have the best ideas!  They'll be appalled!",1191025976

Plenty of people do that so they can sing or perform because it's something they love. If you want to do creative things and think it will be that important to the world, then the people who will mock you for doing something like this shouldn't bother you too much.",1191025129

No embassy or state dept. to help you out, so you're pretty much just staying there. Not to mention what happens the next time you try to travel and they see the stamp. Good story though.",1191024930

Specifically, they looked at students who failed every single test.<p>And then the next paragraph says ""A sizable number are recruited athletes...""<p>How can a recruited athlete fail at having an extracurricular activity? That doesn't even make sense. It's clear the author is just mixing and matching random studies with his preconceived conclusion. ",1191024424

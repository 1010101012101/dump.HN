The A5 in the iPad (which is different from the iPhone 4S's and Apple TV's A5) is clocked at 1 ghz per core. The A5X could be clocked higher. We won't know until the benchmarks come out.<p>The A5X does have two additional GPU cores. They could be clocked higher or lower than the old GPU cores or the same. Again we won't know for sure.<p>We do know that the new iPad has a battery almost twice as a big as the iPad 2s. Clearly there is a lot more pixels and horsepower to push.<p>Just because a tablet has more or less cores won't tell you everything about its computational power. Some companies may go with more cores clocked lower, while others with fewer cores clocked higher. Others will focus more on GPU performance (and in having the GPU accelerate non-graphical tasks), while others will focus more on CPU power.<p>Ultimately Apple probably couldn't have gotten the battery life it wanted with a quad-core CPU and quad-core GPU at the same time. Apple clearly is prioritizing GPU power, as they have been pushing the iPad, iPhone and iPod Touch as portable gaming devices. Apple has also been pushing the GPU to be used for general computing purposes.<p>I wouldn't be surprised to see the A5X having faster core speeds for the CPUs.<p>Battery life is the biggest concern for mobile devices. Some companies are putting CPU power first, while others are putting GPU power first. This is good for consumers.",1331257455

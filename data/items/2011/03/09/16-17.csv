2305462,comment,2304772,2304772,0,0,primodemus,,,"According to the following extract from 'Coders at Work', Knuth wrote the first version of Tex using pencil and paper:<p>Seibel: Speaking of practical work, in the middle of working on The Art of Computer Programming you took what turned into a ten-year break to write your typesetting system TeX. I understand you wrote the first version of TeX completely away from the computer.<p>Knuth: When I wrote TeX originally in 1977 and ’78, of course I didn’t have literate programming but I did have structured programming. I wrote it in a big notebook in longhand, in pencil. Six months later, after I had gone through the whole project, I started typing into the computer. And did the debugging in March of ’78 while I had started writing the program in October of ’77. The code for that is in the Stanford archives—it’s all in pencil—and of course I would come back and change a subroutine as I learned what it should be. This was a first-generation system, so lots of different architectures were possible and had to be discarded until I’d lived with it for a while and knew what was there. And it was a chicken-and-egg problem—you couldn’t typeset until you had fonts but then you couldn’t have fonts until you could typeset. But structured programming gave me the idea of invariants and knowing how to make black boxes that I could understand. So I had the confidence that the code would work when I finally would debug it. I felt that I would be saving a lot of time if I waited six months before testing anything. I had enough confidence that the code was approximately right.<p>Seibel: And the time savings would be because you wouldn’t spend time building scaffolding and stubs to test incomplete code?<p>Knuth: Right.",1299689941

2305460,comment,2305353,2305353,0,0,jedsmith,,,"The comments on the story, and the first round here, make me worry that people are missing the point. Particularly this one:<p>> VeriFone's point (albeit a stupid one) is that the path from the card reader itself to the iOS device is not secure, so it's a hardware ""problem.""<p>That point isn't stupid at all, and is actually a legitimate gripe. It is my understanding that the Square device is only meant to be used with the Square payment software. Is that wrong? If that's the case, it shouldn't be as easy as VeriFone claims it is to skim a number from the device. I don't follow card skimming, but I would think that the point VeriFone is trying to make here is that Square is making it <i>easier</i> for low-tech criminals to implement a skimmer. While it is possible today, I've never heard it described as <i>easy</i>.<p>Another of the commenters mentioned that professional card skimmers have their own devices. That's fine; that isn't the problem here. Professionals will <i>always</i> do things better than the entry-level criminals. However, from my reading, it sounds like there is the capability here to write a shrink-wrapped iOS app that talks to the free Square reader, and you have skimming for a total investment of an iPod touch (or <i>lack</i> of investment -- you <i>are</i> a criminal, after all). Which is the problem that VeriFone is bringing up, and I halfway agree with given the limited evidence presented to me. We're <i>way</i> too lax with credit cards.<p>Does the Square app really need to know the card number at all, aside from transmitting it upstream? What is the vector here? It seems like the Square device should be a black box that yields only some kind of payment token, and the app only gets the cardholder name (from their screenshots).<p>Square's own security page[1] makes this ambiguous, too:<p>> Card numbers, magnetic stripe data, or security codes are not stored on Square client devices.<p>I've never used Square, so I might be full of hot air. However, I think instantly painting this as <i>not an issue</i> simply because it came from a competitor is doing a disservice to the potential (real) vulnerability here.

The beauty of just creating is that when you build something really, really good, the links will flow to your site.</i><p>Thought experiment: Ok. I just wrote a page offering to give away 20 bucks to the first thousand people that read it. Let's say I am rich and can afford to give the money away. Can't get any more interesting and traffic-worthy than that, right? Heck, this is the kind of thing you'd want to send links to your friends, right?<p>So tell me where it is.<p>SEO is marketing, plain and simple. That means that there is an active component to it -- sharing links on HN, phoning some friends, making some posters for the dorm. Whatever.<p>The value of what you output has nothing to do with some sort of inherent quality. It has to do with how many people you can expose your content to and what ratio of those people are going to like what they see enough to give you a link.<p>SEO is not quality. It's popularity. People don't link to you because you wrote great stuff, they link to you because they like you, are a fan, want to look cool, etc. These are all things that you actively have to go out and cultivate.<p>To say it's all passive is to miss the entire point and to pander to the audience. With all the keyword optimization going on with that page, and the fact that the entire tone of the article is pitched directly to HN and hacker-types, I can't help but feel that author knows better.

The point of abstraction is that you don't need to know the fine details of whats happening under the hood.  You might talk about how, in a C program you can watch what happens to your loop variable as you execute, but really ""variables"" are just abstractions over what the machine is really doing.  If you were to look at the assembly spit out by your compiler that loop variable might be in a register or on the stack or in some combination thereof, and if your compiler does loop unrolling it might have different values at the same time even in the assembly.  And once you get into the reorder buffer or a modern CPU I guarantee you that what actually happens will bear very little resemblance to what you would naively think if you just looked at the C code.<p>So you can execute a loop C-token by C-token and you can execute a fold Haskel-token by Haskel-token, but both are abstractions high above whats happening at the machine level and I don't see why we should prefer one over the other.",1299688898

Tests showed that even if a large amount of the balloon stuck around on the string after it popped, it would have a negligible effect on the performance of the chute, basically laying on top of the chute as it did its job.<p>The balloon itself was call the ""Sky Buster"" and cost about $35 from a local shop. I had a welding shop at the time, so had access to large quantities of helium.  The Air & Gas driver would give helium to me for free.<p>We did a tethered launch of a video camera first (at those times quite large and heavy) and waited until dusk to launch the balloon without the camera.  A modified camera flash was hung below the balloon and had a variable flash pattern programmed into it.  If it was going up, it would flash every 15 seconds or so.  Coming down, it was like once every 5 seconds.  We used that for tracking.<p>The first time we launched it, we tracked it for over an hour before recovering it 20 miles from where we launched it.  Both launches were on a windless night (in Oklahoma a rarity) and once the balloon was at altitude, it clearly started moving with purpose.  We lost the second one after following it for about 50 miles.<p>Back when we did it, we didn't have no stinking GPS or cell phones like these whippersnappers nowadays.  Shoot, there weren't even digital cameras!  We'd have had to do it with film, if we did it at all.<p>Great memories, and ones I plan on repeating with my son.",1299687168

The elevated secretion of human growth hormone during REM sleep is a significant reason why athletes perform better on more sleep.<p>No such analogue exists for the human brain.  Mental activities, at worst, deplete neurotransmitter levels.  I have seen no evidence to suggest that massive dosages of sleep do a better job of restoring these levels than minimally adequate amounts.",1299686961

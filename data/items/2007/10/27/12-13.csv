73162,comment,73079,73109,0,0,mdemare,,,"Well, 'risky' knowledge seems generally easier to research than the knowledge to contain it. See the atomic bomb vs. the missile shield, over 60 years later. It's easier to destroy than to create.<p>Also, humanity isn't exactly united in aiming our progress in the right direction. However, I don't think we'll go extinct any time soon (that would take nothing less than a very big asteroid).",1193489292

73158,comment,73112,73130,0,0,brl,,,"I'm going to answer this too because we are in the situation you are describing.  We are writing a platform that we intend to release under a liberal no-strings-attached free software license (ie: not GPL).<p>We're not worried at all about people taking our code and using it to build proprietary products.  In fact, we are going to encourage people to do exactly that because, as far as we can see, other companies having a vested interest in our platform is pretty much a win-win situation for everybody.<p>Of course as a business, we have revenue generating activities with the platform planned for ourselves, but it really seems unlikely that another company would choose to compete head on with us about that.  We wrote the platform after all, so there are many different ways we could rain on their parade if they decide to use our software in an antagonistic way.<p>\n",1193487851

938307,comment,937918,938042,0,0,rdtsc,,,"> Real Information Theory, as opposed to Data Transmission Theory, has to take into account the receiver. The transmitter has to have a model of the receiver, and then devise the data that will transform the receiver according to the intent of the transmitter.<p>It seems that in general, for any two entities the level of the abstraction used for communication between them, should be the highest common level of abstraction that both of the two entities can operate in.<p>Take your example of the mathematician. If  he is using an application that understands what a topological space or a mobius strip is, it seems then he can use those terms in the language that he uses to communicate to the computer.<p>Some computers understand what a Vector is. One can refer to vectors in the language used to communicate with that machine. For example a command like ""multiply vector a and vector b"" would seem reasonable.  However if the machine is just a bare x86 box without any operating system, it will not ""understand"" what a vector is so one has to ""talk"" to it in terms of registers, memory and IO ports and so on.<p>This idea of course leads into DSLs.  A machine can rise very high on the abstraction level scale today but the abstraction will be confined to a very narrow domain usually.",1258048734

938300,comment,937986,937986,0,0,Freebytes,,,"Yes, the point of using a library is to save time.  Spending an hour searching for a particular function reference is certainly a bother.  I have seen instances where I discovered that I could have written the raw code myself faster than finding the answer to use the 'easy to use' interface.  An example of this was a program library I was using that handled graphics.  I wanted to used graphics that were compressed within one file instead of having separate bitmaps for each.  I searched for hours for a solution using the library, and I never got it to work.  So, instead, I wrote something that would decompress the files into memory and let the library simply pull the images from memory.  I then had difficulty with this so I made something that loaded the images from memory instead.  I still used the library for its other features, but this part was a complete pain, and I could have saved time simply by writing these parts by myself.  Documentation is important!  (However, I am guilty of not writing documentation.  The fun is always in the process of creating not the process of explaining.)",1258048583

Chazelle is a very smart guy, but here he's trying waaaay too hard to be cute, and the information density comes out very low.<p>Here's a one-paragraph summary. Anything that doesn't immediately seem familiar is an indication that it might be worth skimming the corresponding bit of Chazelle's article, although frankly there isn't much more content in his article than in my paragraph.<p>Progress in computer hardware is slowing; progress in algorithms is where the fun will be in future. At a high enough level of abstraction, all computers are basically the same. You can think of a computer as a thing that applies programs to data. The correspondence between programs and meanings-of-programs is basically arbitrary, kinda like some early 20th-century French intellectuals said about natural language. You can treat programs as data, which e.g. allows you to write programs that make copies of themselves. This is a bit like how living things make copies of themselves. An important class of problems take the form ""Find a thing satisfying such-and-such requirements"" where it's clear how to check an alleged solution rapidly, but there's no obvious way to find a solution in the first place. For instance, finding mathematical proofs versus checking that they're valid. It turns out to be good to interpret ""rapidly"" as ""in time that grows at most polynomially in the size of the problem specification"". Making this all rigorous gets you the notion of an ""NP-complete"" problem; there are many such, and it turns out that in some sense solving one is the same as solving them all. No one knows whether such problems can after all be solved rapidly (in the lingo: if ""P=NP"" is true). If they could, then mathematics and protein-folding and many other such things would become easy. Also, e-commerce would collapse, because it depends on public-key cryptography, one version of which depends on the conjecture that large numbers can't reliably be factored rapidly. There is no such thing as a program that looks at another program and the data it operates on, and tells you whether it will ever terminate. Such undecidability seems kinda like intractability (i.e., insolubility in polynomial time) but it turns out that undecidability is useless but intractability is useful, because often if you replace ""find something such that X"" with ""find something such that showing it isn't X is intractable"" you get an easier problem but one whose solution is just as useful. For instance, generation of (pseudo-)random numbers. You can ""prove"" you know something without revealing what it is (e.g., demonstrate that you can factor a large number, without revealing the factors); the same ideas also allow, e.g., two people to determine which of them is wealthier without either revealing their actual wealth. Similarly, you can ""prove"" that you have a proof of a mathematical theorem without revealing any of the actual steps in the proof. All this depends on P!=NP, or some slightly stronger variant thereof. Algorithms are cool. Traditional mathematics isn't enough for modern science; in the future there'll be lots of simulations and computer models -- algorithms. But we know how to reason with mathematical formulae, and as yet we have no equally strong ""calculus of algorithms"". This needs more research.<p>(Some of the claims in that paragraph are pretty silly. I think that in every case that's because what Chazelle wrote is silly in the same way.)",1258047801

Describing it in English is too ambiguous and verbose, x86 assembly is probably too presice and too hardware specific, a turing machine program is too theoritical and too rigurous.   So then you make something up, and I think eventually it looks similar to Python, Ruby or Pascal.<p>However, in practice the language itself is not worth much outside academia unless it comes with a solid library.

Don't think ""I should be happy because I have these things or because others like me look happy."" You're not happy. Change something. You have <i>zero</i> responsibilities beyond the well being of yourself and your family.<p>Change the job, deliberately, carefully, and as quickly as possible. Even if a heart-to-heart with your difficult boss improves that relationship, there's still the commute and your desire to spend more time with your kids.<p>A job is just a job, and they don't care (much) about you. You're more or less pluggable. Your kids are the world, and you're losing them everyday, even when you're with them 24/7. My son is eleven and I love him exactly the way he is today, but I ache from the fact that I will never again be able to talk to the four year old he once was. Max your time and quality with your kids, they're good for you and you're good for them.<p>If you have trouble figuring out what to do ""from now on,"" then just try to figure out what you can do ""for awhile."" Give yourself some space and time to look around. You're smart enough and disciplined enough to write a book, so you can probably work remotely. Get a contract or permanent-but-remote job with someone on the other side of the country, or New Zealand, so that there's no question about the work from home thing. You don't have to save the world with your first change, you just have to push the world back a bit, so you can see what's possible.<p>Downshift. If you have more than 12 (or N) payments on a car, sell it and buy a good enough cheap car that serves your needs. If you're not commuting then you don't need much car. Get rid of cable/dish (but keep the broadband). Sell your house and buy a smaller one in an older neighborhood (assuming the economics work for that). Get rid of as much out-flow as possible, and save it instead.<p>Take a hard look at money expenses and psychic expenses, and realize that most of our ""have tos"" are merely ""want tos."" If you're doing something that sucks (like your job) because you ""have to"" live in a certain neighborhood or in a certain way, then think about what those supposed ""have tos"" are doing to you.<p>You do have to take care of yourself. As they say at the beginning of an airline flight, if you're traveling with children (which you are), in the event of an emergency place your own oxygen mask first, so that you are then able to help your kids with their oxygen. Point, don't suffer in a field of suck because you think it's good for your kids. Take care of your needs within the bounds of responsibility and propriety, and you'll be better able to take care of your kids.<p>Much good advice in the other comments. Look at it all with slightly unfocused eyes and see what it all suggests that will work for you. Talk to a trusted friend and a close relative.

That much economic strength attracts the attention of a dissatisfied population in a poorer nearby country.

He used to say we'll be using emacs for decades if we really invest some time learning it. He was right.<p>A REPL for any language used atm. Cool if coupled with the above.<p>REPL/shell history with incremental search, like readline. This is the most powerful single feature I use. Hitting Ctrl-R and typing usually 2-3 keys gives me back the previously entered line I intended to find. If your REPL doesn't have it embedded, use rlwrap. Look at -H option to control where your history is saved exactly. Use big history size if you want to be reminded what you typed months ago - having 10/100k of history entries doesn't hurt really as it's still quick.<p>Tab completion is cool as well. For rlwrap you can pregenerate keywords for completions (eg. your favorite libraries) and it will add completions for terms entered during current session.<p>A good SCM for tracking changes even if working alone. I find centralized ones annoying; hopefully we've got Darcs & Git, both awesome.<p>Using multiple desktops/workspaces to try new ideas in a space which doesn't clutter your current visual, so you don't waste your time rearranging it.<p>Pen & paper.

So it makes me nervous that it's not working out for you.<p><i>Where should I turn? And what would you do?</i><p>Normally, that's what I'd ask somebody like you - someone successful, who gives to his peer group.<p>But since you're asking me (us), what I would do (have done), in order:<p>- Read the research: <a href=""http://www.trendfollowing.com/whitepaper/happiness.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.trendfollowing.com/whitepaper/happiness.pdf</a> .  The research says that exercise, sex, sleep, lots of time devoted to meaningful relationships, engagement in work, enjoying the moment, and regularly achieving goals are the main correlates of happiness. People overestimate the potential effects of big changes in their lives (lottery winners / paraplegics).<p>- Start with:  Sleep, exercise & meditate.  They're easy and you can do all three today.  I replaced the SSRIs my health professional gave me with these habits, and feel much better than I did (indeed, research shows they're more effective than most of the medication).<p>- Take a week.  Breathe.  Tell your wife and kids that you're going away a few days to think about being happy and making them happy.  Find a forest or a quiet room somewhere and just sit and think for a week, about how to be happy and make them happy.  Don't watch TV or read books or write code. Just sit and breathe and think.<p>- Ask your family what to do.  They know you better than I do. Especially your kids - kids have a way of totally ignoring the bullshit they're supposed to see, and just <i>seeing</i> instead.  Your parents will know you too.<p>- Make a plan.  Doesn't have to be detailed, just has to have steps, in order, that you think will mostly solve this problem if they are executed properly.<p>- Do the plan.<p>- Consider spirituality.  By that I just mean how you really feel about the Big Questions, about who you are, your place in the world.<p>A final note: I discovered fairly early on in life that I'm fundamentally unhappy. With absolutely no good external reasons, when logically everything in my life is going great, I still tend to emotionally feel unhappy.<p>My default dopamine-ostat is too low, basically.  This has made it very clear that, for me, happiness is a fundamentally internal thing.  Your outside circumstances (within reason) have only marginal effects on happiness.<p>My solution is to continuously practice mentally relaxing.  Releasing tension in my diaphragm, my face, neck & shoulders, breathing, and then eventually my mind - running through all the reasons why I'm basically OK.  This eventually makes me smile, and feel happy.  Repeating this practice regularly has made it almost a subconscious habit.

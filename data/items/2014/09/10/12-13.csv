I would think they would be high in the list of misuse cases any aircraft designer would consider.<p>&quot;we should refrain from being quick to judge which is more or less intuitive.&quot;<p>We should not be quick to judge which UI is more effective, but by definition we can be quick to judge which is more intuitive.  In fact, the more time you spend with a system, the less qualified you are to comment on whether it is intuitive.  Judging whether a UI is intuitive should take very little time and no expertise past understanding basic operations.  I&#x27;m certainly not qualified to judge, but I&#x27;d think anyone who has experience with modern flight systems would be qualified to comment on whether a particular design was intuitive.",1410353982

I really want to know!<p>There are some technical concerns, but a disproportionate amount of criticism is because the lead developer[0] of systemd also developed PulseAudio, which was adopted by distros too early and therefore caused a lot of problems for people.<p>People remember PulseAudio without much fondness, so they are bitter and take it out on systemd.<p>It doesn&#x27;t help that he has a somewhat direct manner of communicating, which some people find off-putting.<p>So, to answer your question, a lot of it is personal, not technical. That&#x27;s why you see much more vitriol than you&#x27;d otherwise expect for a somewhat technically controversial, low-level piece of software.<p>[0] <a href=""http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lennart_Poettering"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lennart_Poettering</a>",1410353960

I have yet to see a straight forward way to accomplish this with PG</i><p>From personal experience (also from others: <a href=""https://github.com/blog/1261-github-availability-this-week"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/blog/1261-github-availability-this-week</a>), I don&#x27;t think you want to failover a database automatically.<p>Of all the issues that could cause a machine to decide that a failover is needed, most of the root causes make a failover actually non desirable (a hardware failure for example (failover is good) is way less likely than non-reachability due to load (failover is disastrous) and unless you are very careful, an automated solution will act the same way in both cases.<p>Add to that the huge cost of failing back during which time there&#x27;s no more slave to fail over to: Until 9.4 ist released, failing back requires you to file-system-level copy all the data back to the failed master to bring it back up as a slave.<p>After 9.4, re-synchronizing an old failed master to the new master will actually be possible in most cases (a mistaken failover is usually covered by these).<p>In case of an emergency, first make sure that a failover would actually help (if you&#x27;re down because of high load and a misconfiguration of your system, failing over won&#x27;t help, but will only make things worse), then fail over manually.<p>As I said, there are way fewer possible emergencies where failing over would help compared to many, many more where failing over would actually cause more damage.<p>This is valid for all non master-master database configurations I&#x27;ve had to deal with so far, but, again, it&#x27;s even more pronounced with postgres because of the very time (and bandwith - which could mean &quot;costly&quot; when you cross the public internet) consuming failback (during which you have nowhere to fail over to again).<p>If you really, really want to do it, have a look at pgpool (<a href=""http://www.pgpool.net/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.pgpool.net/</a>) which can automatically fail over to a slave and which also is able to read-load-balance between one or multiple slaves.

If you ever tried to change anyone else&#x27;s mind you know by now how hard that is. Not even founders themselves can predict how well their own ideas will do. Larry and Sergey originally tried to sell Google to Yahoo for $1m.<p>And even if people are convinced your idea is a good idea, they&#x27;ll still have to compare it to the existing idea they are already working on and see which one they&#x27;re more likely to do well with. A better, more ambitious idea might seem frightening. A simpler idea might seem more tangible. It could be at least a year before one can convince themselves it&#x27;s ok to let an old idea die, and at least two years to pursue an ambitious one. Ambitious ideas really are that frightening.<p>If you are not convinced choosing between two ideas like this is hard, here&#x27;s a simpler test that doesn&#x27;t even involve a good idea. When you have only a bad idea and no good ones, how long does it take you to stop working on it?<p>Regardless, good ideas will have competition anyway. You can&#x27;t avoid it. So actively working on the next step of getting feedback on what you have is a sign you are strong enough to take the next steps, however small they seem, as opposed to hiding to avoid competition.<p>Dropbox launched on HN (<a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=8863"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=8863</a>) and their biggest gain wasn&#x27;t the number of users they got from HN.

8296124,comment,8291416,8295783,4,0,DominikR,,,"Hi, here are the answers:<p>> How did you know the account was hacked?<p>Thunderbird, which I used almost exclusively at the time was unable to login, then I tried it via their website which didn&#x27;t work.<p>I contacted support, and they told me that someone has changed the password and logged in since. They gave me the option to get my account back, by providing a scan of my ID or passport, which I did.<p>The hacker never contacted me. I do not know to this day what his or her goal was because the attacker didn&#x27;t send or receive any emails with my account. I believe that the attacker got access to a large batch of accounts and he simply couldn&#x27;t find a way to contact me via Internet. (I didn&#x27;t use Facebook or other social services at the time)<p>> Did you have a secret question that could have been guessed?<p>I never used the secret question option on any service. Whenever I&#x27;m forced to enter something, I enter senseless garbage like &quot;jkanshbuicbwnaiubdaibvjabfuzabfnbi&quot; precisely because I think that secret questions are unsafe and dangerous.<p>> Do you know what phishing is? Would you have ever fallen for it?<p>Yes, but I have never shared the login data with anyone and when I logged in on other machines (which I did rarely) - I used a browser that I had on my USB stick for that (which was encrypted)<p>> Is it possible your saved password was stolen by malware?<p>I do not have any reason to believe that (I never had a malware problem that I know of), but obviously I could never rule that out. But on the other hand my GMX account wasn&#x27;t really important. There were accounts that the attacker could have used to steal money from me (for example: PayPal), yet I have never lost access to any other account.<p>Like I said, I still can&#x27;t rule out the possibility (nobody could), but I believe that I had a reasonable setup at the time. I used the GMX website (rarely) via a browser on my encrypted USB stick (which I still possess) and had a Thunderbird setup with POP3 at the time so I wouldn&#x27;t have to login.<p>Hope this answers your questions.",1410350700
8296123,comment,8294539,8296020,10,0,userbinator,,,"I think the concept you&#x27;re referring to is <i>self-indicating</i>, or in this case the lack thereof. A much more commonplace example that comes to mind is volume control knobs on things like stereo amps; the &quot;old style&quot; had a knob directly connected to the potentiometer controlling the volume, so it was self-indicating and at a glance (or even just by feel if the pointer is tactile) you could see what position it was set to. Now it seems fashionable to use knobs that don&#x27;t have any markings and will spin continuously, meaning that you have to look at the display to see what the setting is.<p>To me it sounds like a cost-cutting measure - to have controls that move, there has to be an actuator in them, which makes it more expensive. My stereo which has self-indicating volume knobs actually contains a small motor that rotates them when I use the remote control.",1410350696

2680140,comment,2676670,2677387,1,0,btilly,,,"I've thought before about Knuth's proposal (see <a href=""http://micromath.wordpress.com/2008/04/14/donald-knuth-calculus-via-o-notation/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://micromath.wordpress.com/2008/04/14/donald-knuth-calcu...</a> for his description) that Calculus be introduced using Big-O, little-o notation.  I once drew up a curriculum based on it, and it seems to avoid the issue that you describe.<p>In particular the idea of approximation seems inherently useful.  All approximations take the form something = approximation + error, so the idea of having a useful language for the error seems useful.  Once you have that language, the tangent line is just a particularly useful example.  Only after working with tangent lines for a while would you get to the definition of the derivative.<p>The nicest thing about the approach is that all of the derivative rules are easy to remember for tangent lines.  Product rule?  Multiply the tangent line approximations, throw away the high order term.  The chain rule?  Plug one function into the other.  And so on.<p>The <i>only</i> thing that I found did not flow naturally was L'Hopital's Rule.  However that rule is a source of confusion for students who don't understand the importance of the precondition that the limits be of the form 0/0 or infinity/infinity.  And furthermore all standard cases where it is useful are obvious upon inspection for anyone who knows Big-O/little-o notation.  (Don't believe me?  Crack open a textbook and look at the problems that you're supposed to use the rule for.  They are all obvious.)",1308686294

2680131,comment,2674045,2675489,1,0,krschultz,,,"Simple, you just don't have any deductions. Or narrow it down to a handful of deductions. The loopholes are not sending in false information to the IRS about how much you made. The loopholes are all the deductions that some know to take and others don't.<p>For example, I know I make the same amount as another guy at work. We both rent (no mortgage deduction), neither of us have student loans, neither of us are married, and neither of us have kids. We both spend about the same on living expenses, loans, etc. We both file the same way and work for the same employer in the same job. But he used TurboTax and I hired a professional tax accountant. I got almost $2,000 more back on my refund last year than he got.<p>Roughly the only difference between us was who prepared our taxes. Obviously my tax accountant leveraged more deductions for me than TurboTax did for him.<p>If there were no deductions, it would be quite simple. Take a certain percent of your income and deduct it to the government and that's it. The deductions cause all the problems.<p>Now what are the other options?<p>The flat tax/high sales tax sounds good in theory, but it sucks in practice. We need roughly 20% of GDP for taxes. So 20%+ sales tax on everything? If I'm buying a yacht, or a vacation house, or an airplane why would I buy it in America? Simply put, nobody would. But if you have to buy dinner, buy clothes, put gas in your car, you have to buy that locally. So that kind of tax kills people on the necessity and doesn't impact people on the luxuries. Of course the answer is to give a 'necessities' refund, which would force the actual rate to be raised even higher. Do you think anyone is buying a luxury item in the US when the sales tax is 35%?<p>You can strike out the idea of a luxury tax, we've tried it and it failed spectaculary.<p>High property taxes would put a permanent end to any kind of housing market recovery.<p>Corporate taxes are even less workable than income taxes.<p>And it has been shown that spending is far more flexible than income. I.e. we often hear the argument that people move to low tax states (which mostly they don't, but let's say conservatives are right and they do), which is easier, taking your vacation to a non-US destination or getting your company to move out of the country? Income is fundamentally less flexible than spending.<p>Any of the other plans come out really regressive. The best way to capture tax revenue fairly is through income tax, if you eliminate the loopholes it should capture nearly everyone equally.",1308686009
2680130,comment,2677899,2680017,2,0,yaakov34,,,"Avi Bar-Zeev says that the solution to WebGL security will be to ask the user to explicitly enable it per site (so it runs only on trusted sites), to sign shaders in the same way drivers and plugins are signed now, and maybe to maintain a whitelist of sites allowed to use shaders (or any WebGL at all). OK, that will work, but I don't feel that there is much chance of that happening. I still remember when JavaScript was a new-fangled untested technology, and IT departments would disable it by default on untrusted sites. Some people still surf only with scripts disabled. But really, there was immense pressure to give web apps a lot of the features of native apps, and everyone pressed ahead despite the security concerns, which ended up being very serious and costly. I suspect that the same thing will happen with WebGL - it will end up being on by default. The Khronos white paper on WebGL security is a very short and superficial dismissal of extremely complex issues, and Avi Bar-Zeev is being unrealistic about browser vendors being able to work around it all.",1308686009
2680129,comment,2678874,2679931,3,0,Silhouette,,,"> Where is it that you live that is so resource constrained, in both bandwidth and electricity?<p>My home, in the UK.<p>We actually have a pretty good deal on bandwidth compared to most people here, but wasting several gigs just to download patches every few days is absurd.<p>The electricity isn't really the issue (though bills for that have risen far above inflation in recent months) but the heat generated by running that machine and all its accompanying peripherals full time is relevant at this time of year.<p>Besides, why kill the planet pointlessly? A staggering amount of precious resources are wasted because people leave equipment in power-draining stand-by modes all the time these days.<p>> Also it's fair to say that whatever you've saved in electricity has now been decidedly outweighed by the two hours of developer-time you spent updating it.<p>Presumably I would have had to spend at least the same amount of time spread out over those two weeks if I'd applied each patch as it became available, probably more because much of the software uses rolled up patch releases so I probably avoided a few intermediate steps.<p>I think my general point, that the amount and size of downloaded patches in modern software has become absurd, stands.",1308686007

2680123,comment,2676670,2677144,1,0,btilly,,,"I'm sorry, but every part of your response betrays a severe lack of understanding of the history.<p>People understood the solution to Zeno's paradox centuries before we had a rigorous definition of limit.  And limiting processes were understood both before, and after, without necessarily referring to limits.  (In fact in computer science people prefer the more flexible Big-O/little-o notation for that purpose.  Knuth has in fact suggested replacing limits in introductory Calculus with that notation and I'd be quite interested to see how well that would work.)<p>The idea of infinitesmals were thought up well before limits.  In fact the idea of a limit came out of Cauchy's work.  Cauchy tried to define an infinitesmal as a function that went to 0.  (His idea of an infinitesmal became what we now call a Cauchy sequence.)  When limits came they did not explain infinitesmals - they replaced them.  It was not until Abraham Robinson came up with non-standard analysis in the 1950s that anyone came up with a sound explanation of infinitesmals and properly explained the connection with limits.<p>And finally I was trying to explain what things are like from the perspective of the student.)",1308685883

The innermost is the smallest and most knowledgeable: cutting edge and long-standing researchers. The mid-circles are commercial developers. The outermost circle is largest and least knowledgeable: end users, advocates, etc.<p>The purpose of documentation in this model is to inform and educate the next circle out. The definition of documentation in this model is the process by which the next circle out is informed and educated.<p>Now the mid-circles are pretty good at documentation, but the inner circles, the researchers, are very, very bad at it. Institutionally bad. So bad, that the whole function of documentation to bridge the moat that has grown between researchers and developers is taken over by other groups where it is done vaguely well. Now in applied physics and mathematics, especially related to computation, you don't see much of that moat. Discoveries echo the world pretty rapidly: there are open communities and open publishing forums, and the interesting stuff is picked up pretty quickly - anyone out there who might want to develop in those areas has ample opportunity to learn about it and make the decision to participate. Think about memristors and quantum computing as good examples.<p>This is far from the case for the life sciences: the gulf there is huge and yawning, and there is no comparable open community large enough to close it (DIYbio and open biotech movements are still too small).

They also interact with settlement and clearing services that ensure the verification of proper ownership and conveyance of securities.  In the old days, something like a third of all trades failed to meet the three-day window because some part of this process would fail.<p>2. There are very very specific rules regarding how the orders are crossed (buy and sell side) and which orders take precedence in the (limit order) book.  It looks like the MtGox guys didn't think this through and the trader in question took advantage of this naivete on the part of MtGox.<p>3.  Most exchanges are ""brokered"" to facilitate trades while MtGox is more like a swap-meet.  Brokered exchanges are more expensive to trade in but they have the advantage that brokers can ""know"" how to get price-improvement based on market conditions.

Often times, these services will link to freely downloadable versions of the paper. However, should this not be the case, you still have two options.<p>2) Go to the author's website. It's very common for academics to put preprints or other free versions of their papers on their personal websites. You may need to check all the authors on the paper, but a good rule of thumb is to check the first listed author and the last listed author.<p>3) If the above isn't available and you really want to get access to the paper, you can always try emailing the authors and asking for a copy. As with personal copies on websites, giving out copies to those who ask is allowed by most journals.<p>4) As you point out, you can physically go to a library and use a public terminal. Most large cities have universities. Save up the hard to find references and make a weekly or monthly trip to the local university library.<p>In the far past, you used to have to go down into the ""stacks"" at a university and dig out a physical copy of a paper you wanted.

That additional set of claims is why I say that MS is being disingenuous, if not outright lying.

The Mac as originally imagined by Raskin was not the Mac that eventually shipped (for better or worse).<p>Considering Raskin's ideas about user interaction as ""out there"" is a matter of perspective. Touch screen interfaces that are now common today were once considered ""out there"". His love affair with the Canon Cat wasn't just a personal obsession. He made (what I considered to be) a group of well reasoned arguments about why it was so good based on the <i>concepts</i> it brought into reality. Off the top of my head I can recall automatic file saving (with no consideration to the file system) being one such argument. This feature will be shipping in the next release of OS X (Lion). If Raskin's ideas in the Humane Interface were ""out there"", then I take that phrase to be synonymous with ""avant garde"".<p>The zoom UI he talks about in another chapter (and what the OS X app Raskin has attempted to implement) seems like a strong candidate for a general data exploration and discovery UI. What he put forth in the book was conceptual, and no one has yet made a commercially or critically appealing implementation. That doesn't mean it <i>won't happen</i>.

2679952,comment,2679276,2679926,2,0,masklinn,,,"> The blog post was trying speculate about slicing an array to a hash, or iterating backwards from ""-1"" in a hash, or something.<p>It was mentioning features which don't really make sense on associative arrays, or are not compatible with mixed usage:<p>* Some features (e.g. sorting values) simply can't behave the same between arrays and associative arrays (on an array it will change the value's index, but it can't change the value's key on an associative array)<p>* Splicing (not slicing, though that would probably work as well) hardly makes sense on an associative array, you just don't need it (splicing is the replacement of an indexed section of an array by an other array  which depending on the language may be of a different size, including empty): you can just set the keys instead (e.g. combine with an other associative array)<p>* The final issue is with indexes, including ""interesting"" indexes (direct and in slices/splices) such as indexing arrays from the end (a very nice feature of some languages: Python and Ruby share it with perl) using negative numbers. You just can't do that if you mix things up, so you have to rely on calls like `val = a[length(a) - 2]` instead of just `val = a[-2]` (note that there are languages out there which do <i>not</i> conflate arrays and associative arrays and still don't implement this feature, and a restricted class of languages on which you can actually have negative indexes on arrays)",1308682930

So, a good practise is not to name DOM elements with javascript variables.<p>The reason you never ran into the problem is because that locally you create a variable with a reference to the DOM element, so you are practising a ""workaround""",1203026154

116100,comment,115369,115700,0,0,DaniFong,,,"PG explicitly gave justification for this:<p>""Ideally you want between two and four founders. It would be hard to start with just one. One person would find the moral weight of starting a company hard to bear. Even Bill Gates, who seems to be able to bear a good deal of moral weight, had to have a co-founder.""<p>That does seem to be true. But I wouldn't think that implies a need for specialization, nor that it would help.<p>For further comments on the subject, Philip Greenspun has written substantially about how small teams of two or three consultants handling <i>everything</i> associated with a project would outperform, in terms of time, money, quality, and customer and consultant satisfaction, more specialized, supported teams.<p>That's contingent upon picking the right people, and training them the right way: communicating the right values, building up a well rounded skill set, getting people thinking about the customer and how to them to pay for stuff. When VC's took over and the structure was rearranged to encompass business specialists, and hr experts and so on, the company rapidly collapsed. There were other factors too: Joel Spolsky writes that the consulting market collapsed in general, but ArsDigita had <i>big customers</i>, which actually didn't go away, they just started doing things in house because ArsDigita got worse.<p>He explains some of this in the following link:\n<a href=""http://itc.conversationsnetwork.org/shows/detail94.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://itc.conversationsnetwork.org/shows/detail94.html</a>",1203025899

116092,comment,115800,115800,0,0,jgrahamc,,,"Fundamentally, this sort of spam is about getting links to their sites (first for direct traffic and second for PageRank).<p>So, you should attack the links and not the accounts:<p>0. Check your URLs against blog spam blacklists.  Exclude recently registered domains (all of the ones mentioned are less than one month old).<p>1. Links on stories that have been become popular should be real hyperlinks.<p>2. Links on unpopular stories should go through a news.yc redirector (since this means they don't get PageRank)<p>3. Stories that go nowhere (likely spam) have their links removed and a text version of the link placed next to the story name for anyone who really wants to follow that link.<p>4. A 'spam' button could be handy.",1203024940

116090,comment,115369,115830,0,0,DaniFong,,,"Speaking from my personal experience, the most valuable thing I seemed to gain when we went from from one person to two is companionship. Having two people on board made it much easier to keep up the momentum, because I now didn't have as much need to put down work to hangout with my friends; I was already working with a friend!<p>I've found that separating out the technology and business concerns (at least in the companies that I've worked at) leads to, occasionally, bad solutions, tension, and a lot of the creativity is squelched. Sometimes, good ideas look uninspired from merely a business perspective, uninteresting from a technical perspective, but in reality they're great ideas.<p>A good example is the DOS licensing deal. Making a CP/M compatible operating system (poorly) isn't that bright. And from their business perspective, IBM couldn't see it's platform being commoditized, because they failed to understand how portable software would become. But Bill Gates understood.",1203024685

Here's what I do, which works fine in IE6 and 7:<p><pre><code>  <div id=""bob"">...</div>\n  <script>var bob = $('bob');</script>\n</code></pre>\nSeems almost identical to the code in the post (mine says ""var"" and his doesn't, mine uses $ to get element by id, his uses a 'get' function that presumably does the same thing). It does not produce an 'object undefined' error (or any error that I've seen).<p>By ""it works fine"" I mean that the variable bob references the appropriate DOM element and behaves as expected.<p>What should I change in the above to reproduce this error?",1203023825

As far as I recall, it always happens, but if you're saying you don't run into the error then it may only be with objects. For example, create an object named bob, and an HTML element with an Id of bob. Then try to access the objects properties. IE6 will reference one or the other.<p>Untested, but it may also have to do with globally defined variables.",1203022988

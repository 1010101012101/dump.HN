They can send or grant access to digital photos without you knowing. Being able to grant access to photos of you on a social network is just an extension of this. Granting access so that people can see the photos when viewing an album or see an album in an album list is (or could be) separate from where or how that permission to view the photo is made known.<p><i>and then not only do I not know the picture is out there</i>\nWe don't know that about physical photos, or photos that are sent in emails.<p><i>but co-workers can see it by visiting my profile and looking at pictures tagged of me?</i><p>Now this would be problem. There shouldn't be anything viewable on your profile by other people that you can't see yourself. Photo's should only be able to be shared and sent in private by explicitly sending a message to a group of people.<p>I don't think that scenario is possible with G+ at the moment. Tagging someone in a photo automatically gives that person access to the photo.<p>What G+ currently lacks is a way to tag someone without giving that person access to the photo. That's not perfect but it's better than the alternative which you described. Hopefully they'll find a way of making it possible to tag someone in private without putting it in front of people in ways that it's not possible in the physical world. You can't pin embarrassing photos on people without them noticing.",1311586582

2801929,comment,2801464,2801889,12,0,patio11,,,"Let's say I'm a major American bank and I want a complete payroll system done, for internal use.  This is going to cost me a couple million on the low side.<p>Why don't I do it with a $50 a week freelancer?<p>1)  I don't trust him, at all.  If he could implement payroll systems, why isn't he charging millions of dollars?  He's probably copy/pasting ""Yes no problem sir I will implement your system to the specified requirements"" to 30 jobs a day and looking for a sucker.<p>2)  Who is going to manage him?  Me?  If I have to manage him, he doesn't cost $50 a week, he costs ~$8,050 a week, because I'm the VP of a major bank unit.  Talking to poor people is always a bad use of my time, because it competes with talking to rich people.  (This is somewhat exaggerated but not false.)<p>3)  Payroll systems are not a one-man job.  After you get to team sizes of 20+, it really helps to have a system for recruiting/managing/etc them, so that you don't have to.  I mean, at 20+, someone is statistically going to be getting married or quitting or dying every year.  Do I want to deal with that?  No.  Let their boss deal with it.<p>4)  If I pay an Indian freelancer $50 a week to make my payroll system, and the payroll system fails to ship on-time, I will lose my job because <i>I did something which was freaking insane</i>.  There are things which, in American business, are insane, and there are things which are Known To Be Not Insane.  Paying large, established technology consultancies millions of dollars is Known To Be Not Insane.  Even if the project fails, it is not your fault, it is their fault.  If the $50 a week Indian turns out to not be God's gift to programming, hiring him was <i>definitely</i> your fault.<p>It gets more complicated, but this hits some of the high notes.",1311586107

If something, it is more about traceability than anything else. With a trusted third-party, some money laundering scheme become possible but they are not that different than regular money laundering operations.<p>What bitcoin is about, however, is about the feasibility to have pseudonymous entities that can't be traced to real persons, yet trade online commodities and services. Take lulzsec fot instance : they accepted BTC donations and could spend them to buy web hosting, to make donations to various associations, or to simply buy services from anyone accepting bitcoins.<p>Right now, the anonymity is lost as soon as BTC is converted into a regular currency, but as long as it stays in the BTC network, the account is nothing more than a number (and an IP if you don't use a anonymisation network).<p>You could have pseudonymous software developers, writing code in exchange of hosting of gfx works, all of that happening in the gray legal area of international services exchanges.

I ask because Lockheed in Sunnyvale took some heat (I believe a fine and a restriction on being able to bid on contracts for a period of time) for failing to use &#x27;established industry practice&#x27; in the testing and delivery of what ever it was they were delivered. My neighbor at the time worked for them and recounted the gruesome (or in this case non-standard) details. I never really thought to question whether or not it was actually written that way, it just made sense that it would be. When I was with Intel and Intel was building milspec 8080s there were a list of standards that had to be met and all of the test equipment was calibrated based on that as well. Seemed like a pretty natural part of the government contracting business.<p>So you&#x27;re saying that Contractors are under no obligation to meet standards? Or just that this contractor would be exempted?

While it sounds cool to bring in a &quot;dream team&quot; of technical experts to save the day, it seems likely that additional non-technical issues are at play besides (or in addition to) the technical incompetence of the contractor.<p>Here&#x27;s an alternate scenario:<p>1. The government agency that hired the contractors does not completely understand the business requirements in a way that allows them to effectively communicate them to the contractor. This could be due to numerous factors outside their control such as changing legislation or perhaps because the ACA is so large (900+ pages) and relatively new that there are few experts who understand the minute details sufficiently to specify how the exchange should work.<p>2. New requirements emerge at the last minute, requiring the contractor to make significant changes. While it is recognized that additional schedule time would be needed to sufficiently implement and test the required features, there is enormous pressure (political and otherwise) to adhere to the October 1 release date, so the implementation of the features is rushed and QA is skipped.<p>3. There are dependencies on legacy government and commercial systems that are outside the control of the contracting agency and the contractor.  The functionality of these systems impact reliability and performance, introduce strange bugs, etc.<p>5. The software is delivered on time but is woefully inadequate.<p>While I wouldn&#x27;t rule out the incompetence of the technical staff, these types of issues can often be traceable to problems that are more in the realm of management.",1382333448

The fact that these people (government and it&#x27;s contractors) are going to have and handle our most intimate information AND that the IRS is also in the loop scares the living daylights out of me.  The level of incompetence being revealed here is almost without description.<p>To go all the way up to opening day, have these problems and then offer that five million lines of code need to be redone is, well, I&#x27;m at a loss for words.  I am trying to think about how badly one could fuck up five million lines of, say, Python.  That&#x27;s a lot of code.  It&#x27;s almost like saying that you set out to write a portal for the ACA and mistakenly wrote an navigation system for a new spacecraft.<p>In many ways this is great.  I can&#x27;t think of a better example of how bad big government can be and often is.  It is hard to argue with what is unfolding before our very eyes:  An attempt at centralized control that succeeded on the legislative front but is failing miserably in execution due to nothing less than incompetence at all levels.  And, to boot, it is costing hundreds of millions and will probably cost billions if it doesn&#x27;t implode under it&#x27;s own mess.<p>Look at this in sharp contrast with what I happen to think would have been a far better approach:  Free market decentralized healthcare.  All they had to do is open interstate borders to launch all available companies into competition and slowly open other gates in order to promote free and open competition.  Yes, judicious regulations would have been required here and there, but always with the goal of having an ecosystem that is as free as reasonably possible.<p>In this scenario at worst the government would launch a open-source projects to develop open and well-debated APIs for publishing and sharing all pertinent information.  Various sites could then connect to any available insurance company through these standard API&#x27;s in order to gather, present and sell insurance to anyone.  Instead of having a badly executed centralized attempt to develop a portal you&#x27;d have thousands of entrepreneurs jump into the fray for an opportunity to offer the best possible services.  Very soon the best-in-breed services would rise to the top and continually evolve better and better offerings.<p>Cheaper, faster, better.  All three.<p>Instead we got this shit.",1382332602

6583479,comment,6583327,6583393,2,0,greenyoda,,,"$800 pays for roughly one day&#x27;s worth of work for a senior developer in the US. One thousand lines of working, debugged code (which is presumably what&#x27;s being paid for) sounds like an awful lot of code for one person to write in a day, if the problem domain has any degree of complexity. Some parts of healthcare.gov could be quite complex, e.g., interfacing to other government systems whose APIs are not well documented.<p>And I agree with the people who think that 500M lines of code is unlikely. Judging by some of the statistics that were cited in other comments (e.g., &quot;Windows XP was 45 million lines of code&quot;), this may be more lines of code than Microsoft has written since the company was founded (many of the lines of code in XP were originally from NT, etc.).",1382332199

We need to segregate data from a single format/layout.<p>I do not think the analogy to spreadsheets applies here. There are (at least) thousands of perspectives on/presentations of scientific data that are completely meaningless. In that case the perspective and presentation matters (though the sharing the original data opens up the opportunity for others to find new perspectives as well, though at the moment they do need to &#x27;plot their own charts&#x27;)<p>That said, once the author has chosen the perspective that perspective will be conveyed via some medium. At that point the data should be able to stand on its own. I used the word presentation, but &#x27;layout&#x27; is probably closer to what I meant. If we take my use of presentation literally then we agree and this is why someone posting slides for a talk without also posting the talk is a terrible idea.<p>With regard to expertise, I would argue that everyone is an expert on what format/layout they find easier to use (sort of like why we let people move their windows around in a window manager instead of forcing them all full screen, re: tablets are major offenders here).

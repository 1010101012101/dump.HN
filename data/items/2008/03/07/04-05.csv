Like any engineering discipline, software engineering is applied to both safety critical and non-safety critical domains.<p>When I was in school this article[0] was required reading.  Your life and safety depend on software engineers every time you dial 911, ride an airplane, etc.  Not everyone is writing Facebook applications :)<p>[0] <a href=""http://sunnyday.mit.edu/papers/therac.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://sunnyday.mit.edu/papers/therac.pdf</a>",1204865718

I assure you that I certainly did <i>not</i> use <i>any</i> nonstandard hacks to get IE5 and IE6, the banes of my existence, to work at 3am on the night before the site launched. I swear to god.<p>Ahem.<p>On a completely unrelated note: Does anybody know if IE 8 runs in XP under Parallels? I have some websites that I should probably check.",1204865399

131058,comment,130976,130976,0,0,cawel,,,"<i>It is the freedom of participants on the Internet to offer and profit from whatever products, services, or content they choose that has made it such a phenomenal source of content and innovation.</i><p>The author includes what I would call the rules of the network's traffic in his 'services' and it is a problem in the argumentation. On one side, there are user services (e.g. e-commerce, search, etc.) and on the other side, there are network services (e.g. quality of service, priority of packets, guaranteed bandwidth).<p>I would say it is <i>because</i> the attempts to tinker with traffic rules on the network have been restricted that we had so much innovation during the internet history and therefore such a wide spectrum of network applications today.<p>Thus, while I do not refute what he says above, I would say it is primarily because of net-neutrality that internet has been so successful (a ""phenomenal source of content and innovation"").",1204865271

131045,comment,130499,130499,0,0,phaedrus,,,"My high school algebra/trig teacher was a real drone; every problem had to be done by rote and she cared more about your handwriting and placing the numbers the same way she did than whether you actually knew what you were doing.  She had the imagination of a four-function calculator; to her it ""math"" meant ""mechanical"".  I made C's and D's in her classes, because I'd see shortcuts that got the right answers faster but she'd mark right answers wrong if we didn't use her methods to get them.<p>Meanwhile I was writing my own 3-d graphics engine at home, working all the math out from observation of the real world with yardsticks and using graph paper, because I didn't have internet at home to look up the answers or the math education to know .  Every time I'd try to ask her if anything from algebra or trig connected in some way to what I was doing, or if she knew of some math tools that would help me, she'd shut my questioning down and belittle me.  I actually worked out sine/cosine and rotation matrices out on my own before we covered them in class, because she wouldn't point anything out to me.<p>To this day I still don't know if she was such an unimaginative rock that she really didn't make any cognitive connection between math and real world applications, or if she just hated me for being a nonconformist.",1204863244

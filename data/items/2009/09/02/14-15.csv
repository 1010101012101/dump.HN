You could have manually downloaded the files for all the libraries you need, placed them in the directory, and required them directly. See, who needs rubygems? Oh hang on, rubygems is about 1000x easier than doing all that.<p><i>""You just happen to manage your libraries using gems""</i><p>Yes, because gems are the standard way of managing libraries in Ruby, and work transparently and conveniently. Where the hell is Ryan getting all these gem-using libraries anyway, if not from gems? And what is supposed to be wrong with it, anyway? I have never had a problem using a non-gem library even with gems present and a duplicate installed. Just require the non-gem lib first. What is so freaking hard? I assume it's some stupid problem he has to solve at Heroku - and his solution is trying to change how the entire Ruby community does things, to their detriment, benefiting only him. Screw him.<p>Oh well, anyway .. who cares. You're a crank and so is he. Rubygems is here to stay and if you don't like it .. well again, who cares.",1251903526

I know when I was learning HTML you would use tags to make a document look a certain way much like you would use MS Paint to draw a picture. The web has evolved and HTML takes care of describing what the content is. That's a big difference.

If you plan significantly far in advance, you can usually find airfare for $500-750 round trip, or cheaper, depending on where you want to go. Then if you plan it out, you can usually stay wherever you are for <$100 a day.<p>I'm not sure about where you are, but even someone in the US, working full time at McDonalds, making $6 an hour, could afford a week long trip every year by putting away 10% of each paycheck. $1200 is (roughly) enough for a week long trip to most of the non-tourist packed places, and you can save that up by putting away a little more than $20 a week. Just making lunch at home rather than eating out (or buying a pre-made lunch) can save you almost that much. Its just a matter (like he said) of priorities.

800280,comment,799994,800088,0,0,jerf,,,"Caching is Hard (TM). If you take the time to fully understand the HTTP caching system, it will make sense, and it will become clear that problems with stale content are because you are using it wrong, usually because you set an expires time in the future for content that will change. It's really easy to not understand the caching system, or default to using a framework, and that's where the problem usually lies.<p>A framework will often choose to default to setting some expires time, often because the framework authors don't really get caching either and don't fully understand why that's not really going to work. (It is natural that they end up here. E-Tags is a much safer default, but to make it efficient requires more work from the framework user; why that is is a bit more than I'd like to get into in this message.)<p>If content is going to change, you should be using E-Tags, not expiration times. This includes content that you may not think is going to change, like Javascript files, but in fact do sometimes. The best solution in this case is actually to keep creating new URLs and set Expires into the far future, so that if the browser needs ""something_8ef38b.js"" which had its expires set in 2030, it knows it doesn't even have to hit the server, and if you ""change"" the file, your new web pages will actually reference ""something_f32190.js"", a new file. The timestamp-on-the-end trick is the same. I wish more frameworks built this idea in better, it's generally useful.<p>(Drawing parallels with functional programming's idea of ""value"" is left as an exercise for the reader.)",1251902896

Instead, he'd stop working on the previous task, optionally move those papers to a free spot on his desk (but maybe still spread out as though he were working on it), and put the new papers on top of whatever's left in front of him, and work on them there.  One organizational system I've seen that works well with this is the ""sheet"" system, where you periodically spread a sheet over your desk, first saving out anything you expect to need very quickly, and then after you haven't gone under the sheet for anything in some time, archive everything under the sheet.  The ""sheet"" might actually be one of those plastic desk covers you can buy in an office store.<p>I do this on my computer, leaving dozen of windows and tabs open until I get back to them, rather than closing them and writing notes on what I need to do.

I don't buy the 'singularity' idea either.<p>It makes for fantastic science fiction but in the real world all resources are finite and every technology we've come up with so far has had to deal with the harsh realities of the thermodynamic laws and regular materials science. There is plenty of room at the bottom, indeed, but the bottom is not 'bottomless', and the engineering problems are formidable.<p>Sure, there is progress, and plenty of it. But to think that that progress is 'easy' or 'accelerating' belies the enormous amount of hard work that goes in to achieving it.<p>And with every step every next one becomes harder, the laws of diminishing returns.<p>I think that our illusion of ever accelerating progress has more to do with the fact that ever more people are 'knowledge workers' and 'scientists' than anything else, the greater a fraction of our society that advances our knowledge the faster we will move forward in this respect.<p>The 'uploaders' are essentially practicing wishful thinking about that great question plenty of people have had to deal with in the past: How to avoid dying.<p>Unfortunately I don't think any of the people alive today is going to be able to accomplish that feat, statistics is overwhelmingly against it, everybody that ever lived in the past has died before the ripe old age of 150 of one cause or another.

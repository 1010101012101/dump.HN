Today, all start-ups that do any kind of data processing advertise themselves as &quot;big data&quot; companies that use &quot;advanced machine learning&quot;, but from my own experience most of them rely on pretty trivial algorithms behind the scenes.<p>Also, some of the numbers in the article really make you scratch your head: Achieving more than 95 % accuracy when ranking a large number of student teams in an eight-months long business plan competition, based solely on the results of a simple online questionnaire taken at the beginning of the competition? This just seems too good to be true considering the data sources they have at hand, even assuming that they use the most advanced machine learning in the world.<p>Of course, if you test your algorithm many times at different competitions you will achieve a perfect or near-perfect prediction accuracy for some of them (by pure chance), which however doesn&#x27;t mean that you can achieve this kind of accuracy consistently (which is where the business value lies).",1399820151

7728820,comment,7728477,7728477,11,0,rauljara,,,"> Accounts of former Oracle employees paint a picture of a boss with an infectious energy, and a propensity to elevate his charges to incredible heights only to dump them later. As one journalist put it, “He’s like a juicer, he squeezes people dry and then discards them.”<p>> Ellison, who before the crash, was known to brag about playing tennis on company time, and was so seldom at the office that, when he was spotted, employees joked about “Elvis sightings,”<p>It sounds like he got good employees to run his company and then treated them like shit.  It&#x27;s the sort of behavior that can work well for a few ceo&#x27;s if only a few of them do it.  But if every ceo were to behave like that, the pool of experienced employees out there would be nothing but bitter, cynical dried up husks who had sworn to themselves never to get exploited like that again.<p>This isn&#x27;t a fair comparison to Mr. Ellison, but imagine if you will, an article in praise of a mob boss.  &quot;Well, he was horrible and he murdered people, but he made a lot of money.&quot;  And it&#x27;s true, mob bosses can accumulate great wealth.  But mob bosses can only thrive two conditions are met:\n1) there are people who don&#x27;t engage in those behaviors for them to exploit.  \n2) society doesn&#x27;t fight back effectively against their bull shit.<p>So, no I don&#x27;t think Ellison is the equivalent of a mobster.  But I do wonder why so many people put up with that sort of bull shit.",1399819884

7728780,comment,7725732,7727804,4,0,unclebucknasty,,,"I appreciate your thoughtful response and I have, in fact, heard this mentioned over the years. I am not sure that it is entirely accepted as the rationale (and, in fact, it has been disputed by some), but it has certainly be suggested.<p>I should probably have been clearer in my initial question. While there has been some discussion about in different circles regarding the genesis of this &quot;problem&quot;, it has largely been muted. At a minimum, the volume and quality of earnest discussion has been remarkably limited relative to the importance of such discussion. Instead, we get pablum such as &quot;they hate us for our freedom&quot;, even while we drone strike, destroy, and kill.<p>Remarkably, the theory that you repeated fits with this pablum as it puts virtually no emphasis on our actions, save for a passing mention or two. Somehow, even with a long and complex history of involvement in the region, we magically have no responsibility for any of wha is happening, save for being free and not Muslim. I find that absolutely incredible and profoundly myopic. Still, even if one can somehow remove the notion of consequences for previous behavior as a cause of 9/11 and what preceeded, and also manage to detach all responsibility from the West, there should be little doubt that our current course of action (yes, including drone strikes), provides indisputable cause for real grievances borne of our actions and, potentially, a generation of terrorists that modern history has yet to see.<p>Or, to put it in your terms, unless the goal is to kill every single Muslim or sympathizer who could have either answered the call for the Caliphate or been affected by the loss of a loved one who was presumed to have done such, then it seems that our current course is either exceptionally stupid or specifically designed to create perpetual conflict.<p>But, back to my original point: all of this that we are discussing here is incredibly important and lurks beneath the surface. It has brought us down this path of surveillance, etc., yet it is not questioned or discussed. Think of how fantastically stupid it is that we are in such a reactionary mode that we no longer question key assumptions regarding why we are doing what we are doing in the first place. Even if you believed that it&#x27;s all about the Caliphate, shouldn&#x27;t that single word be part of our daily discusion for as long as we ar at war, drone striking, and spying on Americans? Shouldn&#x27;t we be openly discussing what it means and how we might work to not radicalize members of that community? Shouldn&#x27;t there be a sober assesment of Western policy and how it might intersect with legitimate complaints and even radical ideas? This, instead of an attitude that &quot;they hate us for our freedom&quot;, followed by more drone strikes, spying on Americans, etc.?<p>Apologies for length.

She asked for a cup of coffee, paid, took the coffee out to the car and got in the passenger seat.  They drove for a short while.  They stopped the car. She removed the lid and spilled the coffee.<p>A more fair comparison would be if she had poured her boiled kettle into a mug, carried that through to another room, and spilled it on herself as she sat down.<p>It&#x27;s likely that in the latter case the water which would have been cooled by the mug and a metal spoon would have been less hot.  That would have given her a few more seconds to remove the scalding clothing, which would have helped to reduce the severity of her injuries.<p>Part of the problem is that McDonalds was serving coffee hotter than people would have it at home because McDonalds wanted it to stay hot for the duration of the journey.",1399817844

They specifically only modeled slow expansion through cultural diffusion, meaning they completely ignored things like languages spread through conquest. They literally ignored the Roman empire in the evolution of Indo European. So if you look at the actual timeline their simulation puts forth, it has things like Iceland being populated by settlers from the Faroe Islands, who took fifty years to cross the sea there. They also did much of this on the basis of cognates, and so by their model Russian splits off of the slavic languages first and Polish is closely related to Ukrainian, because Russian has a bunch of Greek words that make it seem superficially different.<p>Overall, it&#x27;s not good science.&quot;<p>The poster also recommends a video that breaks this apart in greater detail, though it&#x27;s over an hour long:<p><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jHsy4xeuoQ"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jHsy4xeuoQ</a>",1399817822

The &quot;wheel&quot; argument against this theory is just too damning, and their counterargument is weak: that nearly 4000 years after the language family split up, words for wheel, axle, and yoke managed to spread to nearly all daughter languages as loan words. But the problem is that these supposed loan words words reflect the same sound changes as all of the basic, inherited vocabulary. Thus the wheel vocab must be inherited from the same point in time as words like thou/tu/du.<p>Not to mention that the material culture found at the Ukraine sites is a much better match for what we know about early Indo-European culture.",1399817312

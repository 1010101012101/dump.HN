91609,comment,91575,91588,0,0,ericb,,,"For folks doing simple net present value valuations, please keep in mind that small businesses and small websites are a different world. Most require work and promotion to maintain. Thankfully, IRobot, whose stock I own a few shares of, has never asked me to run an adwords campaign, pay their hosting bills or do their customer support. Selling a small business is often like selling a job.<p>Take a look at the sitepoint marketplace at closed sales and see how many you see going for 10x multiples. In terms of selling, the value of any business is exactly what the market will pay.",1198194085
91608,comment,91575,91584,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"The traditional rule of thumb for a starting point is 10x if there is any growth at all.  Selling for 1x makes no sense, unless you have some liability concerns that you haven't mentioned--keep it for a year and get the 1x revenues, and then you're ahead.  Unless it's taking more time than you'd like to spend on it, a 1x or 2x offer should be laughed out of the room.",1198193300

91606,comment,91575,91593,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"""So I would say $1 Dollar per signed-up user""<p>This makes no sense for an anti-spam service.  They aren't ""signing up"", they are ""opting out"" of all future emails from whatever they are using the email for...so this user will probably come back, but if you spam them even once, you've lost them for life.  They aren't the same as ""signed up"" users for a toolbar or installations of software.<p>This is a pure ad play, in its current form, and has revenues from that source.  There might be ways to integrate this with other anti-spam, anti-malware, privacy, whatever, features to build a product suite that is worth more than the sum of its parts, but right now it's an ad-supported model.",1198193148

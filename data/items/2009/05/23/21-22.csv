There are so many need-to-know languages and frameworks just to keep up with making a living that I have a hard time justifying learning a 30-year-old language that has had the goodness sucked out of it by other languages.  Unless it is spectacularly interesting, I adopt just-in-time learning, which works pretty well on your 30th language.",1243115901

Peer review decisions are double-blind, and impact factor doesn't play a role (shouldn't, anyway).

623837,comment,623299,623722,0,0,gruseom,,,"It was a real question. Only an idiot would question Dijsktra's well-known contributions to CS. My issue is that his profuse judgmental statements about practical system-building strike me as misguided. When I read those of his writings he sounds like an intolerant theorist in a bubble.<p>From the web pages I've read, it's not clear that THE was ever used. It's also not clear what Dijsktra actually did on Algol. Indeed I always thought it was Naur, not Dijsktra, who is associated with making the first good Algol compiler. Also, Dijsktra is described as having ""led the team"" on these projects, which is ambiguous.<p>I'm happy to be wrong, but it would certainly be interesting if Dijsktra's disastrous (to my mind) pronouncements about how to make software were grounded in deep experience with successfully making it. It would be much less surprising if they were grounded in brilliant theoretical work and a habit of telling other people they're doing everything wrong.<p>Edit: it's my fault for being cryptic, but inventing algorithms does not count as what I meant by ""making"" something, i.e. building a working software system that people use. Anybody who's heard of Dijkstra knows that he invented algorithms.<p>Edit: but then I like Beethoven better than Mozart too :)",1243114526

Part of it is not their fault - my browser's flash plugin is very choosy and likes to lock up and crash my browser when their embedded pdf loads.  But combine that with the fact that I've been repeatedly misled to their documents in the first place and I have a sort of Pavlovian response going.<p>(Not that I blame the Scribd guys for this. I would use and have used similar tactics, but it does have its costs.)",1243114174

I get sick of hearing about 3D printers without getting any context about how they fit into the broader world of manufacturing. Action figures seemed like a nice comparison as you can buy both as finished products. Most other products made by 3D printers are just models so a comparison isn't fair. If it was a marketing post I wouldn't have called out how 3D printed action figures cost 10X as much for a lower quality product:) I'm a custom manufacturing enthusiast spreading the word about these technologies, both good and bad.",1243113459

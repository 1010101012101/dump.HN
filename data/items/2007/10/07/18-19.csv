Perhaps the mobile browser  doesn't support whatever CSS you're using to left-align things, and taking the <center> tags literally. I don't know how much of this was my fault either. :-)",1191783521

But i hope to take on the business end of things in my company because i have more experience there. Knowing how the program works is a great value for a business guy like me, because i can communicate with the hackers on my team, and speak in their dialect. Its also kinda necessary to understand how your product works. ",1191782109

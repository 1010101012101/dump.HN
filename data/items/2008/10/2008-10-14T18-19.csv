332449,comment,332417,332417,0,0,petercooper,,,"What a shame Apple's releases today have stirred up a cauldron of disappointment and inconsistency. No significant spec upgrades, prices have gone up (in the UK, at least) - we've gained slightly better video, a glass trackpad, a new case, and an SSD option.<p>With computer prices falling (generally), it's remarkable that Apple hasn't responded to that at all. Even the old MacBook they're trying to pass off as the new entry level one is £20 more than the same machine was yesterday (yet $100 less in the US).<p>Apple has muddied the whole notebook range. The MacBook now comes in <i>two totally different styles</i>, as does the MacBook Pro (with the 17"" now being a particularly poor deal, despite the increased standard res.) And what's with the new Cinema Display? Looks nice, but it's not workable for Mac Pro users (the market Cinema Displays were meant to be for) and it's heavily overpriced. It's really just an accessory for only the newest releases.<p>Apple was making good progress at bringing pro-level technology to the user at prosumer prices, but this whole update has sent them back into the stratosphere. The entry level ""new"" MacBook is over £200 ($400) more than the old entry level MacBook.. how can I recommend this to my PC-switching family now?",1224010423

332447,comment,332098,332290,0,0,cookiecaper,,,"Right. My laptop isn't my only computer, but I use the optical drive a lot. It's useful for watching / ripping DVDs whilst traveling, and it's just come in handy for me a lot of times. Again, there are only two USB ports on my MacBook Pro ... one is usually used for an external mouse and if there wasn't an internal optical drive I'd often have to use that port for the optical drive.<p>It also introduces storage and transportation concerns and issues of a majorly important component of a computer, which sucks. I mean, I use it a lot. When I'm out doing contract work clients often ask for a CD or give me one. Family members and friends do this with some frequency as well, it's one of the easiest ways to transfer data that exceeds reasonable attachment size (I have crossover cable with me at all times, but usually a CD is easier if it's not a ginormous amount of data). I'd be quite limited by the lack of an optical drive.<p>Incidentally, I use the optical drive in my main workstation somewhat less than I use the optical drive in my laptop, though I wouldn't want to give that up either.",1224010306

332437,comment,331493,332420,0,0,DanielBMarkham,,,"Look at it this way -- the founders set the system up assuming everybody would try to game it. The system is built on the fact that the president will overreach, the congress will be fractious, etc. It is built assuming checks and balances are needed, not that only great people will serve.<p>Perhaps putting it that way is a little better for you? In my mind, the president is first and foremost an average citizen who is called upon to do some work for the country for a few years. I think if we forget the ""average"" part of that equation, we start expecting more and more of the office and crossing the line into hero worship. If the president becomes a hero or in any way messianic, we've lost the true meaning of the office. The point is that we're all qualified. It's a democracy.<p>Can we have presidents that we think did great jobs? Sure. But that immediately gets into opinion, which is politics by any other name. My great president is the night watchman, making sure the nation is safe but staying aloof. Perhaps yours is the architect, designing our society of tomorrow, etc. (Substitute various opinions of ""good"" and ""bad"" here) I'm not going to accept your position, nor your mine. So we vote on those poor schmucks that are big-headed enough to think they can do the job better than the rest of us.<p>If you think about it, it's a great system. It allows lots of conflict without violence, it allows one person to stand for all the ills of the nation, it promotes competitiveness among the parties to solve problems. It even gives those who require it heroes to worship.",1224009820

332421,comment,331485,331485,0,0,jcl,,,"The conclusion -- that we can tax most of a CEO's income and he will be just as happy -- ignores the fact that people do what they do because they <i>think</i> it will make them happy, not because it actually makes them happy.<p>Sure, you can tax that CEO down to a base-level salary, then prove via a survey that he was just as happy in a year's time.  But what about the next CEO-to-be?  He is willing to do extraordinary work for extraordinary rewards, because he thinks it will make him happier -- even though it won't.  He may take a look at the heavily taxed existing CEO and decide that the extraordinary effort is not worth the modest rewards, even though he'd have been just as happy having made the effort.  So he doesn't try as hard, and society as a whole is denied whatever product or service he would have created.<p>In general, some level of dissatisfaction is what drives us to better ourselves, and it's suspiciously convenient that we humans don't need much to be happy and yet always expect to be happier with more.  Legislatively removing the incentive to pursue greater happiness -- even though it can be shown that we don't need it and can't get it -- is playing with a complex process that could have unintended consequences.  Society's happiness as a whole could suffer.",1224009059

173232,comment,173046,173046,0,0,scooter53080,,,"I would like a way to blacklist domains that are being squatted.  I’ve thought it might work to have a Firefox plugin to report and block these sites.  If you could get a large enough community using it, the list would grow pretty quickly.  You could maybe even have a script that would gray out any of those sites on Google.  Would this be enough of a disincentive to squat?...if the domain was effectively ""removed"" from the Internet for those using the tool.  If a domain was actually bought and contained real content, it could be removed from the blacklist...but the process to do so would have to be difficult enough to not negate the disincentive of the blacklist.  Any other ideas on how to harm the value of a squatted domain enough to make squatting not worth while?  (When I say squatting I also mean domains that are just parked and for sale.  Technically I don’t think that is squatting, but it seems like that is being lumped in the conversation here...could be misunderstanding that though.)",1209095854

173218,comment,172945,172945,0,0,daniel-cussen,,,"<i>When it comes to cost cutting, many times it’s design or marketing that goes first. This is like an applicant ditching the cover letter on their resume when the job market is down: it’s laughably bad timing.</i><p>I'm so, so sick of this kind of post.  Some design guy thinks design guys are not well treated.  OK, sure, maybe, why not.  Then the guy goes on to say how design is everything.  Sometimes the design guy disses the hacker for skimping for a few hundred on design.  Other times the design guy insults the hacker's taste.<p>""Design"" is not the only part of the business where you design things.  In product development you design too.  The ""design"" branch is the one concerned with the design of things that don't change the function of your product, just the appearance.  It's makeup.  Design, as a verb, is important, but what this guy is talking about, ""design"" as a branch of business, is really exactly the first place to skimp.<p>Not that skimping in this area will not have its costs.  The reason you have to cut costs to begin with implies cutting something that you may need.  If you have been running a tight ship, anything you cut will hurt somewhat.  It's like starving.  After a while, your body starts consuming parts of your organs.  It consumes developed skeletal muscles preferentially.  Sure they're important -- they wouldn't be there in the first place if they weren't -- but they aren't your liver.  You won't die from having your muscles catabolized.  People often talk about the other branches and go back and forth over which matters most.  ""The market is everything.""  ""No, the product -- the product matters the most.""  I feel these discussions sometimes omit the fact that many areas can be necessary, just like you need several organs to survive.  Is your liver more important than your heart?  A moot point.  You need a market, you need a product, you need to monetize eventually.  You can argue that any one of these is essential, and you'd be right.  But design?  Design is the appendix of a startup.  At best, it is the second kidney.  Nobody cares what your logo looks like.  Nobody cares about the favicon.  The buttons don't need to be 2.0.  None of these things are very important, and worse, they're not even that hard to do.  Making a passable favicon is not that hard, and you can always pimp it if/when you have tons of VC money.",1209094001

173208,comment,173161,173164,0,0,nostrademons,,,"I'm reading a good book at the moment - <i>Growing a Business</i> by Paul Hawken.  He has this to say about ideas:<p>""The idea itself is just the tip of the iceberg.  The iceberg is your life.  Don't worry about anyone stealing your idea, because they can't steal your life.""<p>That's resonated a lot with my experience so far.  I've had to make literally <i>hundreds</i> of decisions, from tiny software architecture ones to big ones like who are we serving and what will our product let people do.  I suspect that in mature businesses, that'll grow into thousands or tens of thousands.  Each one is an expression of who you are as a founder.  Even if you wrote down everything you know about your business and handed it to a competitor, they wouldn't be able to replicate what you're doing, because of all the unspoken assumptions behind your decision-making.<p>This is perhaps why it's so hard to manage employees before you've achieved product-market fit.  (I worked as an employee in two other startups, both before product-market fit, before starting my own.)  If your competitors don't get it, there's no reason your employees will be able to either, unless you can <i>show</i> them what your doing and how it impacts people's lives.",1209093562

You can&#x27;t just change the implementation of the string type without messing up someone&#x27;s program.<p>Yeah, you can.  &#x27;NSString&#x27; is in fact a class cluster that provides different implementations/representations.  Well, used to be on OS X, because it was changed to be a wrapper for a single CoreFoundation representation.<p>In GNUstep and Cocotron, I think they still use the older class-cluster implementation, and programs are portable between these implementations.<p>Polymorphism, baby :-)",1411106083
8339145,comment,8335010,8338495,1,0,jrapdx3,,,"> My project is a shared library, and so is dynamically linked with code written by other teams, perhaps years ago, or even yet-to-written.<p>Constructing a component architecture is the goal of many approaches, and shared libraries is one expression of that ideal.  When a library is compatible with the calling application and the OS, a library can closely approximate an ideal component.<p>However, components, applications and OSs are not static but constantly changing.  In order for a library to be a component used by many other entities, the library must be continually (at least frequently) curated to remain compatible with all the other components it cooperates with.<p>While the point of a library is to abstract an API so users of the library don&#x27;t have to think about how it&#x27;s implemented, the creator of the library must consider those details very deeply.<p>Whatever techniques or languages are used to create a library, OO, FP, both or neither, the most important consideration is that its source code is clear, concise, logical, and understandable.  The library I create today will decay if not maintained, and if I&#x27;m not around, how easily can someone pick up where I left off?<p>The inevitable tricks employed making procedures or methods work in real code will not be obvious to our successors.  Good ideas, even embodied in obsolete code can be useful if clearly expressed and adequately explained.  Thorough documentation transforms the work into lasting value.",1411106042

Ruby and Javascript are incredibly useful for web dev, but like angersock said, the key is to build projects.  Period. If Python&#x27;s the language you feel most comfortable in, get going with it and don&#x27;t switch until after a project is complete.<p>I&#x27;d suggest Flask as a starting point if you&#x27;re looking for web framework experience.  Twisted might be more your style if you&#x27;re looking at highly concurrent networking projects.<p>&#x27;Distributed systems&#x27; is a little broad almost- are there any software projects in particular in that space that you&#x27;re interested in and could develop expertise in?

8339143,comment,8338750,8338750,1,0,KrisAndrew,,,"My advice is to completely downplay your [lack of] education.  If they ask you about it, just tell them you are self-taught, and wait for the next question. You should focus on what you&#x27;ve <i>done</i> at your job and outside projects.  Emphasize the results you&#x27;ve gotten and the systems you&#x27;ve built.<p>You might have a slight disadvantage during the initial part of the recruitment process (resume submission).  My advice in regard to that is to try and get in touch or meet the non-HR people at the company.  That way you get can a referral and your resume is just a formality.  If this isn&#x27;t an option for you, the just make sure you keyword your work experience well, and pray. :)",1411105938

The term &quot;economies of scale&quot; refers to spreading the fixed costs of production among a greater number of units of output. They are about production efficiency, and to a lesser extent, operational efficiency.<p>What we are talking about here is efficiency when it comes to the allocation of resources across different business units. Central planning is <i>very</i> inefficient in this regard.<p>>>The inefficient parts subsidize already efficient parts making both parts more efficient in the process.<p>No one is arguing that this is not the case. What might be true, however, is that we may not need some of those inefficiencies in the first place. Our current and most popular model of corporation involves central planners. This doesn&#x27;t necessarily mean that we won&#x27;t find a more efficient model of corporate management.",1411105926

And one of them, especially for combat vehicles is that they are &#x27;demilitarized&#x27; which generally involves some damage that would render them unfit to use in a fight. As I recall one of their tanks had the barrel cut off and then re-welded back on with a slight offset. Any attempt to fire it with a shell would cause the barrel to explode in a backfire. However some black powder and wadding was OK which gave a satisfying &#x27;boom!&#x27; and smoke.",1411103518

8339079,comment,8338241,8339004,1,0,Broken_Hippo,,,"I intuitively disagree that uninterrupted reading is beneficial to human development. I don&#x27;t see this behavior from the few people I secretly wonder if they wouldn&#x27;t be considered genius, if they would only take the test. What they do, however, is read a wide variety of topics often. One very rarely leaves the house without a book, has files on his phone as a backup, and downloads enough non-fiction that I wonder when he can read it. Does he read in long chunks? Sure, if the internet is down or he has to wait. Does he do this often? Not if he can help it.<p>The point is that he reads. Often. Likely more than most people get in their half hours intervals - but if that is the only way for people to read, I fully support it. I do not doubt many of the benefits of reading, but I think uninterrupted reading is more of an exercise in extended concentration and Im sure there are multiple ways to learn this.",1411103338

The idea that you should write them as a ritual or a boilerplate is just bananas.<p>In this discussion of major programming paradigms it is important to realise a couple of things: That this is very old discussion and that there are no clear winner. The productivity and usefulness of a language is ultimately shown when it is put to the test of big practical development projects. Currently business is dominated by the object-orientated languages (C#, Java, JavaScript, Objective-C, C++ etc.) and probably for good reason: The dominant problems that software spends its line count on seems to be things like user interface and interface to other &quot;platforms/paradigms&quot; such as relational databases, web services or data files.

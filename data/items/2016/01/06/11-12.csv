The code we wrote more than one year ago making an SQL transaction in 8 statements with async is difficult to understand and have some implicit stuff that you need to take into account. The other problem is not having a multithreading environment (in the official release) because you may want to respond to new tasks instead of blocking the event loop. I have seen timeouts because of this. Even if the recommendation is to do simple tasks, you can&#x27;t enforce this when using hundreds of third party modules.",1452081287

You may disagree, that doesn&#x27;t mean you can&#x27;t be flat-out wrong. Having an opinion does not automatically give that opinion equal weight when history has proven to us again and again that that particular opinion ends up with making society either dangerous or at a minimum uncomfortable.<p>I&#x27;m sure there were border guards in former East Germany that were entirely convinced that their state was the greatest and that&#x27;s why they had to keep people in at all costs, including shooting them if they persisted in believing otherwise and tried to simply leave. After all, that was best for them. But that particular opinion turned out to be very wrong in the long term.<p>People can rationalize the most absurd stuff to themselves and to others, especially when their pay-check depends on it, but that&#x27;s not a requirement.<p>All those that try to pretend that there is some kind of &#x27;reasonable disagreement&#x27; possible about the erosion of privacy and that directly and indirectly help to rush in the surveillance state have quite possibly not thought as carefully and have not considered these things with the degree of gravity required as they claim they have. Having a mortgage to pay may factor in there somewhere too.<p>Usually this is a combination of being too young, too optimistic and in general living too sheltered a life to know what can happen to you, your family and your friends when the tide turns. And the tide <i>always</i> turns, nothing is forever.<p>> Simply, I and many others do not believe that any western government is going to use information gathered by tech companies to preempt threats to entrenched interests and the status quo.<p>I hope you&#x27;re right but history is not on your side in this case.<p>> I&#x27;ve seen the same arguments made here for years, and none of it is convincing.<p>Yes, it isn&#x27;t going to convince you any more than that border guard would be convinced that his job is a net negative to society. Every stream, no matter how reprehensible will always have its fans and cheerleaders. And later on they will never remember that they had agency all along and were perfectly capable of making a different decision. Responsibility is weird that way.<p>> It&#x27;s admirable that you are so certain in your beliefs.<p>It is not admirable that you are so certain in yours.

You don&#x27;t have to believe me - but you now have a second data point for your consideration.<p>I did engage with some points in comments below though, to show examples of this cherry-picking facts, ripping them out of context and twisting them into supporting something completely untrue.<p>But my general point is that this kind of criticism is impossible to defend against. To prove that it&#x27;s mostly bullshit would take me literally writing a book - in which I would surely make mistakes, that then could be used to discredit it entirely in a single article. This is the asymmetry of dishonest arguing - you can get your results with 1/100 the effort if you&#x27;re willing to deceive your reader.<p>When people read a powerful criticism &quot;debunking&quot; things about a group they vaguely know, the default for most is to agree with the criticism. For some reason it&#x27;s natural to humans. All I want now is to make people stop for at least a moment, consider that the article may be unfair, and to not make judgments before double-checking the claims.<p>Maybe I could&#x27;ve written it in a more dispassionate way. It&#x27;s hard for me - not because I like LW, but because I&#x27;ve been in other groups targeted by this kind of criticism, spent <i>way</i> too much time trying to defend the group from it, and I know the crushing feeling that no matter what the truth is, it&#x27;ll be twisted and bent until it can be used as a weapon against you.",1452079247

This extends to their memories, perceptions, emotions, actions, even complex beliefs. And it can be more or less direct. Humans think of themselves as special snowflakes, but we are actually quite simple.<p>2) The degree to which one can manipulate or influence other people depends on<p>___a) the effort and intelligence one expends on it,<p>___b) the degree to which one has knowledge about the target, and on<p>___c) how close one is to the target (i.e. are you &quot;under their skin&quot;, in their house, or 10 km away; what are your intervention options).<p>3) As social animals, we have always been subject to the influence of other people. Usually, this influence has been local, fuzzy, costly, relatively obvious to the target and &quot;controllable&quot; (in the sense that knowledge about target was strongly negatively correlated to (generalized) distance; if target became suspicious of you, target could simply cut you off or increase distance).<p>4) Technology and science currently change the rules of the game, and in profound, basic ways:<p>___a) We learn more and more about how to influence people, both by physical means (regulating temperature, lighting or noise conditions; psychotropic substances or, you know, food; changing the color of a button or playing with the timeline of events; etc.) and psychological means (e.g. using the right words or framing to elicit a certain response or evoke a certain emotion; exploiting properties of the social graph; etc.). This knowledge is, of course, still very imperfect but it is also cumulative.<p>___b) More and more of our interaction with the external or social world becomes mediated by technology ⇒ the options to intervene in the life of someone multiply as technology becomes a more integral part of life. As a result, it becomes very cheap to make targeted interventions in someone&#x27;s life. Example: Today, ranking of search results or filtering of news; tomorrow, entire articles machine-written for you (personally). Automated homes. The mind <i>boggles</i> with the possibilities of augmented reality and/or immersive experiences. Farther out: Optogenetics.<p>___c) Deep and very detailed information about people can be collected in real-time and stored cheaply (no memory decay). The more ingrained the tech, the more detailed the data. For example, real-time monitoring of blood sugar and, in the future, perhaps even stress hormone levels.<p>___d) Physical distance becomes meaningless.<p>5) Due to the tendency towards natural monopolies in the sector, all this information and power accrues in very few hands ⇒ strong and unprecented centralization of both fine-grained knowledge about individuals as well as the means to intervene in their world without regard to distance or cost.<p>It is not hard to see that, to indulge in some hyperbole, &quot;mind control&quot; of a large population undermines traditional means of checking power. Who cares about elections if I can control whom people like? Why bother with competitive markets if I can make people want whatever I have to give (and make them pay reservation prices)? No more need for violent suppression of dissent because I can detect and change inconvenient ideas surgically.<p>To be clear, I am not saying we are already living in a mind-controlled society.<p>What I am saying is that collecting data (or rather letting someone collect data) about us is an integral part of this scenario. If data became more compartmentalized and limited, say, this whole thing wouldn&#x27;t work (or be far less effective).<p>In fact, because technology and science progress anyway, how we handle our data may be the only way we can influence the course of events in this respect.<p>At least to my mind, this is the real issue of privacy. Alas, I seem to be alone so far. It&#x27;s really hard to see for me why this is not totally obvious to everybody. I should finally write that essay that I&#x27;ve been meaning to for the longest time. Then someone can at least attack my argument. Sometimes, in your weaker moments, that nobody seems to see what you see can make you question your own sanity...<p>_______________________<p>PS: I am also not claiming that Larry Page or Mark Zuckerberg are rubbing their hands gleefully (&quot;hihihi&quot;) at the prospect of world domination. I think concrete persons are incidental to this scenario. Heck, the one who ends up controlling, in this scenario, might not even <i>be</i> human. It just doesn&#x27;t matter who. If it is technologically possible, it will be done. Loss or neglect of privacy makes it possible.",1452078617

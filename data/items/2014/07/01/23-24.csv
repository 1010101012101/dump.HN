I hold plenty of the opinions you say are minority opinions. So far as I know, I was neither much more nor much less typical of the HN population when I was new here than I am now. But I did OK and continue to do so.<p>It&#x27;s perfectly obvious that holding a minority opinion <i>can&#x27;t</i> guarantee getting downvoted into oblivion, for the boring reason that you can hold that opinion without expressing it, and in that case no one can possibly downvote you for it.<p>Of course you might (very reasonably) not want to censor yourself to that extent. Very well: all you need do is have some <i>other</i> things you can talk interesting about besides your shortlist of pet dislikes. Then the upvotes you get from being interesting on other topics will outweigh the downvotes you allegedly get from daring not to be a libertarian. Although, I repeat: I&#x27;m not a libertarian, I&#x27;ve dared to express not-libertarian views more than once, and I don&#x27;t recall ever getting wiped out by downvotes as a result. I&#x27;ve seen plenty of other not-libertarian comments that aren&#x27;t invisibly light grey. So you might consider the possibility that what you got hammered for was <i>not</i> the mere fact of expressing an unpopular opinion, but something about how you expressed it.<p>Now, even the approach outlined in the previous paragraph might not be enough, if what you say about your pet dislikes gets you not merely downvoted but hellbanned. (That&#x27;s the thing where your comments are invisible except to you, the moderators, and people with the &quot;showdead&quot; feature turned on, so you never get any karma or any replies ever again.)<p>But -- barring cockups and miscarriages of justice, both of which inevitably happen but are pretty rare -- that will only happen if what you say is not merely unpopular but particularly stupid, or repeatedly boring, or something else of the sort to attract the attention of a moderator and make them think &quot;This person is not adding anything positive to HN by being there&quot;.

But the underlying principles are dead simple: just keep all the history of the memory, never erase anything!<p>Of course, the <i>implementation</i> is not that simple, because efficiency, because complex imperative languages, because many other things.  But the basic principles are still dead simple.  You may be amazed by time travelling with GDB, but OCaml had that <i>years</i> before GNU did it.<p>I feel the same way about Bret Victor.  He does understand things that are hard to grok.  Probably very abstract stuff.  But I suspect it wouldn&#x27;t take much space to write those things down.<p>I gather you have seen his videos, most notably the dead fish and dynamic visualization ones?  Learnable Programming also counts.  Tell, me, why did you find those presentations so amazing?<p>The reason <i>I</i> found them so amazing was their simplicity.  Bret&#x27;s demos show incredibly innovative features, but at the same time, those features felt incredibly simple:  easy to use, the feedback is obvious, and frankly, most of his particular examples don&#x27;t seem that hard to implement.  The hard part was coming up with the idea in the first place.<p>Plus, I can see 2 overarching principles in Bret&#x27;s work: the first one is, using our visual system to see the relevant stuff at a glance.  Give me a graph, not a listing.  The second one is direct interaction.  You could think of it as a REPL on steroids, or even a live image, but it&#x27;s more than that.  In a live environment, you would change a variable, and see the consequences in real time.  Bret Victor goes beyond even <i>time</i>, and let us manipulate systems from the outside, as if they were a block universe (where time is just another dimension).<p>In learnable programming, you can see how he slides the force of the jump, to make it just right so our little Mario can go through that little secret passage.  We can visualize the whole path (that&#x27;s the first principle), and we can see what that path <i>would have been</i> if you change the laws of physics (that&#x27;s the second principle).<p>Very deep stuff.  Very <i>hard</i> stuff.  But as I said, very simple as well.  And I expect future insights will make it even simpler.<p>---<p>Let us go back to my Earley Parsing for a second, because it&#x27;s quite illustrative.  My journey began with this talk[1] by Ian Piumarta.  He mentioned Earley parsing at some point saying it was very general, handles every possible context-free grammars, and is also very simple, very easy to implement: half an hour to translate the algorithm in any language.<p>Months later, I&#x27;m still at it.<p>But you know what?  As I come to understand Earley parsing, I agree with him more and more.  This thing is <i>genuinely</i> simple.  I wrote a recognizer in less than a hundred lines of Lua code, and the whole parser will likely take less than 200 lines.  As I said, simple.<p>Simple does not mean easy however.  Without the proper insights, I could only struggle.  But then I stumble upon a sentence, a picture… and then something <i>clicks</i>.  And I can see the simplicity, as well as the depth.  And then it clicks <i>again</i>.  And it becomes even simpler.  To the point that now, I understand where Piumarta is coming from.  And I still remember why it was so difficult for me back then.<p>I mean, Earley parsing did use to feel kinda complex, and quite ad-hoc.  At the same time, it didn&#x27;t seem too difficult.  I was wrong.  Earey parsing proved to be much more difficult, and at the same time much simpler, than I had expected.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGeN2IC7N0Q"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGeN2IC7N0Q</a><p>---<p>I think Bret&#x27;s work is like that: deep, hard, and simple.",1404257114

So I tried Yii (it was version 1.0.something) and it was great. Quick prototyping, powerful, but simple enough and good support on the forum.

Microsoft&#x27;s alliances were, from the mid-1980s onward, but especially through the 1990s, with its OEMs, VARs, and ISVs, <i>not</i> with its end-users, except secondarily.  The name of the game was to build and defend a territory:  OEM preloads, per-CPU licensing, Office, APIs, proprietary protocols (e.g., Exchange and Directory).  The played the lock-in game to its ultimate and absurd conclusion:  they don&#x27;t understand and cannot fix their own software.<p>Google started by offering tremendous value to end-users via search, and finding a minimally viable way to monetize that (relevant and non-intrusive advertising).  It was recognized from the beginning as creepy, but so long as you didn&#x27;t actually personally log in to the search engine, the personal association seemed sufficiently weak to be acceptable to most.<p><i>That</i> changed with Gmail.  Suddenly you were logged in <i>to your search provider</i> all the fucking time.  And that, frankly, weirded me out.  I avoided Gmail for a long, long time, and still don&#x27;t use it for my personal comms.  I&#x27;ve made my own peace with Google in that I use Gmail, over IMAP, for a pseudonymous account, and transact my search transactions largely with a different provider who pledges no tracking (and I&#x27;ve been in arguments with various folk over the credibility of that, no it&#x27;s not bulletproof), largely DDG and StartPage (both proxied non-tracking search providers).  And yes, occasionally my work mail is served over Google depending on the gig.<p>Then came Google Docs, which further freak me out, storage, and a host of other things.  I basically never saw these as a good thing (from a privacy or data security viewpoint), even though I fully acknowledge the genius of using these to attack one of Microsoft&#x27;s prime foundations (Office + Exchange).<p>Evidence is strong that Google felt very strongly challenged by Facebook and felt it had to create its own social offering, whether to compete, head off Facebook, or ... just sheer competitive spirit.  There was (and is) also an interest in offering &quot;an identity service&quot;, which has been a holy grail of the tech world for at least a couple of decades, and a trope of the science fiction literature long before that.  I can credit the latter with part of my own reluctance to buy into the concept:  a world in which everything is specifically attributable and hence tracked to a specific identity is pretty close to my definition of totalitarian hell.  I reacted just as viscerally when it was Microsoft&#x27;s Passport, as well to Facebook sign-on (I don&#x27;t use FB, I won&#x27;t use services requiring it).<p>Gundotra strongly evidenced a firm belief in the concept, as does Eric Schmidt.  Page and Brin have been less outspoken on the concept, but it seems from what I&#x27;ve seen that they at the very least endorsed the concept.  If they&#x27;re driving it, then as I said, the rot goes to (and starts at) the very head.  And if there&#x27;s a single thing which would most likely destroy Google at this point, even above NSA and other snooping (which they <i>could</i> significantly engineer around, though by changing their entire present focus, see Bruce Schneier and Eben Moglen on this in the past year, particularly their joint Columbia University conversation and Schneier&#x27;s Stanford Law School lecture), it&#x27;s the snooper state.<p>To backtrack a bit:  I also think that advertising when first adopted by Google in the late 1990s snuck the camels&#x27; nose into the tent.  Advertising is at its essence deceptive, and at odds with the interests of the recipient.  By setting up this relationship, Google both created a dissonance within itself and a misalignment of interests with the end user.  I don&#x27;t know that this could have been avoided (figuring out how to tie revenues to Internet services <i>outside</i> of advertising has largely proved a wicked problem), but I think ultimately the camel ended up in, and in control of, the tent.<p><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camel%27s_nose"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camel%27s_nose</a><p>Another metaphor I like to invoke is of grabbing the tiger by the tail.

I haven&#x27;t fully made up my mind on whether to stay or go.

7974042,comment,7972220,7973750,2,0,chriswarbo,,,"It helps to remember that we don&#x27;t gain any expressiveness from a type system, only safety[1]. Type systems can only <i>restrict</i> which programs we&#x27;re allowed to write[1], compared to un(i)typed programs. After our programs have passed the type-checker, their types can be erased to leave behind a raw un(i)typed program. In the case of functional programming, we can imagine it compiling down to something like Scheme.<p>The point is that we can handle error conditions just like we do in any other language: if we&#x27;re compiling to something which looks like Scheme, we can handle errors in the same way: have everything return a sum allowing errors (ie. a Maybe). Even things which don&#x27;t produce errors can be lifted to this type automatically and chained together using a monad. That&#x27;s basically what Haskell does.<p>Of course, lifting simple functions to return Maybes isn&#x27;t very nice, since we&#x27;re purposefully throwing away information; ie. we&#x27;re causing our consumers to ask &quot;did this return a value or not?&quot; when we already know that it always will. The problem is that with composing Maybe functions with simple functions. There&#x27;s no way around this in Haskell, we need to lift the simple functions; after all, that&#x27;s the point of a monad: we can return a wrapped value and we can join a wrapped-wrapped value into a wrapped value but there&#x27;s no way to <i>unwrap</i> a value (otherwise we may have a comonad instead!).<p>Dependent types give us more flexibility than Haskell though: if our output value depends on the input, we can also make our output <i>type</i> depend on the input. For example (where &quot;A&quot;, &quot;B&quot; and &quot;C&quot; are some concrete types, for simplicity):<p><pre><code>    -- Simple function\n    myFunc1 : A -> B\n    myFunc1 = ...\n\n    -- Maybe function (ie. might error)\n    myFunc2 : C -> Maybe A\n    myFunc2 = ...\n\n    -- Maybe monad. Works, but loses some type info\n    liftedChain : C -> Maybe B\n    liftedChain x = case myFunc2 x of\n                      Nothing -> Nothing\n                      Just y  -> Just (myFunc1 y)\n\n    -- Exactly the same algorithm, but without losing type info\n    myType : Maybe A -> Type\n    myType Nothing  = ()  -- Unit type, equivalent to Nothing\n    myType (Just _) = B   -- Result type, equivalent to Just\n\n    unliftedChain : (c : C) -> myType (myFunc2 c)\n    unliftedChain x = case myFunc2 x of\n                        Nothing -> ()  -- Unit value; matches myType Nothing as required\n                        Just y  -> myFunc1 y   -- Value of type B; matches myType (Just y) as required\n</code></pre>\nThis makes it easy to handle runtime errors, without having to pretend that everything else might blow up. Typically, we write most of our code in an ideal world assuming all of our requirements are met, then we write simple &quot;driver&quot; functions which justify those assumptions, returning errors otherwise. Exactly like in Haskell, where we write pure functions for manipulating plain values like strings, then write simple &quot;driver&quot; functions to pull those strings out of files, databases, sockets, etc. using IO.<p>[1] Strongly typed languages can be more or less expressive than each other due to their type systems (eg. dependent types make it easy to express homogeneous lists, which can&#x27;t be done (AFAIK) in System F), but all are less expressive than un(i)typed languages.",1404256094

Doing the same excellent work for an obscure IT department in some random enterprise, for a high tech big corporation, for a SV startup or for a non profit results in very different outputs, and that more often than not these are out of your control.<p>In a sense, the employers with bigger multiplier factors want to bring in the best talent, and should pay above average salaries, industry-wise, but it&#x27;s not required that this extra factor has to be directly proportional to the value added by your position.<p>If on the other hand, you want to define your TrueWorth in terms of a ratio between your BaseWorthIndex vs average BaseWorthIndex for your industry, you are in similar problems. Being (noticeably) above average means you may command above average salaries, but it does not mean an arithmetic proportion will be calculated; after all, our BaseWorthIndex is a fiction and it would be extremely hard to measure.<p>Then there is the issue of cost of living. Since as we discussed before, your compensation is not defined in absolute terms but relative to your peers, the issue of how much does it take to make a decent living at your current location comes to play. Take into account also that this is an asymmetric market and that you are always at disadvantage.

Sure, if you&#x27;re an omniscient being who knows the entire decision tree for a given move in [checkers/chess/go/etc...], there&#x27;s no luck, in the Monte Carlo sense. But, except for simplified positions, nobody is fully aware of the consequences of their move in these games. This &quot;fog of war&quot; is a good analogue for the random winds/ground conditions/ball imperfections that you mentioned in other sports.

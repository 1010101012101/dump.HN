That's why Elon Musk scores very high with me and 'dandies' (that will go unnamed here, but I'm sure you can picture the kind of person I have in mind) are a net loss.<p>Given the chance to really change the world you should grasp it with both hands and run with it.<p>Too many people still treat money as a goal in stead of as a tool, there really is no point in being the richest guy in the graveyard, if you do not apply it to something useful you might as well never have had it in the first place.",1254747526

861676,comment,861554,861609,0,0,scotty79,,,"Also third point seems valid. In software any change can be made technically at any stage, at cost of work hours (that can be sometimes priced as low as 0$ in case of unpaid overtime) and the software quality.\nThe quality is hard to quantify. You can tell apart perfect from usable from unusable, but software very rarely achieves perfect quality and usable software has fair margin from being unusable so changes rarely bring easily noticeable degradation of quality.<p>But changes do have cost. Developer time has to be paid one or another way eventually and degradation of quality raises maintenance and bug fixing costs. All this has to be (and is) factored in the price of the software.<p>On the other hand I think the first point is completely bogus. Computers are extremely cheap. Before personal computers I'd have to buy very expensive manufacturing machine to provide such value with so little work. If I had no money to start with I'd be forced to work for somebody who had capital to purchase the machine. I might never be able to afford one myself.<p>Actually software is extremely cheap because computers are cheap. Software that costs zero could not be possible if computers were expensive.",1254747230

Alleviating human suffering.<p>2. Scientific exploration and discovery.<p>3. Building tools or technology that enhances others' abilities to do 1. or 2.<p>Notice that ""bug tracking system"", ""personal finance management"", and ""company collaboration software"" are not on the list. (And no, I don't want to hear about a stretched analogy about how they actually are alleviating human suffering. Please.) Also notice ""social networking"" is mysteriously absent as well. (Edit: To be fair, Twitter has had a few days where I really think it is making a positive difference in the world. Crapplications on Facebook, not so much.)<p>The only excuse to not be working on one of these things is if you are working towards building some capital in order to do so. Flipping a startup is a great way to do this.<p>At the end of the day, all these neat software tools people are building are not all that important in the grand scheme of things. What they <i>are</i> good for though, is enabling visionaries to start to address real problems by removing financial constraints.

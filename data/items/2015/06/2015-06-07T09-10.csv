If you only need multi-catch refactorings and have never seen the other pieces of code, then you are the luckiest Java developer I have heard off. You are probably working on a green field project with a small team of exceptionally talented people. For people not in that case, chances are they are inheriting a very large code base originally written with Java 1.4 or (shudder) even earlier. They are working with some people that never manage to get the simplest indentations right, let alone the code patterns you saw.

</code></pre>
Currently, there are no policies. Yes, the cache size will expand to as much data you put into it (without expiring). The nice thing about the way I wrote this is that any options passed to the decorator that are not handled by supycache itself are handed over to the `backend` (ie: your memcached or redis connection object), so that is one way to pass on configuribles to the backend.<p><pre><code>  > Being able to determine which parameters &quot;matter&quot; is an interesting feature.

</code></pre>
So, the thing is that it is not the &#x27;parameter&#x27; that &#x27;matters&#x27; it is the <i>value</i> of the parameter that makes this interesting. Actually, this use case came out of necessity -- I felt the need to add an `lru_cache` for a method that operated on some parameters but instead of caching the return value to a key created by the hash of all the parameters, I needed to create a new key on just one parameter (actually, one attribute of one parameter -- kinda similar to the ^user^ object example in the readme).<p><pre><code>  > It&#x27;d be interesting to see some kind of dynamic support for the keys.

</code></pre>
Sorry, the docs have not been clear about it but the &#x27;cache_key&#x27; can <i>also</i> be a callable which is only called at run_time (with the args/kwargs) passed to the decorated function. That&#x27;ll allow you to define your own cache-key-creation rule ! I&#x27;ll update the docs to mention this.<p>Thanks for your comments ! Glad you like it.",1433670798

9674007,comment,9673390,9673390,0,0,dgoldstein0,,,"I like the general idea of defining protocols that can help password managers work more seamlessly.  But this seems too low level.  Most online services run HTTP services, and afaict, this protocol wants to run on TCP/TLS (though it doesn&#x27;t specify); seems like it would be more sane to define it as a HTTPS/JSON api for password rotation, given all the online account providers generally have https servers and could easily add a new https endpoint.<p>But I think the more interesting problem, which this totally ignores, is how to plug in to account creation.  If I&#x27;m a normal user, and a page presents me with a sign up form, I want to autofill the choose / confirm password fields; if I don&#x27;t I&#x27;m probably going to choose a weak password - or worse, one I&#x27;ll forget entirely.  I suppose you could say &quot;just tell your password manager about the account later and let it choose a better password&quot; but the proposed protocol doesn&#x27;t work at all if your password manager doesn&#x27;t know about the account (or doesn&#x27;t know the password).  Whereas if you can plug into the creation flow - possibly via some html / js api - the password manager can be like &quot;hey I see a account creation form that wants you to create a new password, want me to do that for you&quot;? And boom, you are always generating strong passwords.<p>And ideally we&#x27;d have a similar standard for login pages so password managers could slurp up your existing logins as you use them.  1Password does decently at this, but every once in awhile I encounter a bank or some other service that decides to ask verification questions or have a two-page login flow, that 1Password just can&#x27;t deal with.",1433670677

In most European cities this won&#x27;t work as streets are too narrow to accommodate seperated traffic so you need a combination of congestion charging with streets restricted to public transport and/or expensive tunnels.

Model-checkers don’t prove that a <i>program</i> is correct, only that the logic in the program’s abstracted and simplified communications/state <i>model</i> has no inherent race conditions, deadlocks and so forth, i.e. no typical concurrency flaws. Model-checkers don’t “prove” correctness in the mathematical sense (and maybe I should have written “verifiably-correct” instead of “provably-correct”). Rather, model-checkers search for counterexamples to the hypothesis “there are no concurrency flaws in this model”, by exhaustively tracing through all possible distinct execution paths through the model. Amazon calls their models “exhaustively testable pseudo-code”.  If no counterexample is found, then we can be sure the model has none of the standard concurrency flaws, and we can be sure that the communications “housekeeping” code auto-generated from the model will have none either. This is a limited yet extremely powerful and valuable aspect of correctness, the hardest kind of correctness for humans to achieve in concurrent software.<p>I believe software engineers can and should start routinely using model-checking on concurrent logic, taking advantage of the machine’s ability to race relentlessly through enormous numbers of execution paths to uncover subtle flaws in logic. Even a small change to concurrent logic can have far-reaching consequences that are very hard for humans to envision. I believe competitiveness and sound engineering practice demand use of model-checkers on concurrent logic.",1433667643

If you mean intercity, well... I&#x27;m not even sure how you could take intercity-only tickets and as far as I know there are no intercity trains going from Lille to the south. It would probably be around 10 hours even as the slower speed of such a train, never 24.",1433667638

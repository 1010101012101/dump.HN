7021582,comment,7021057,7021457,4,0,vacri,,,"Regarding the overpriced-ness of Australia, for a long time our dollar was worth around 2/3rds of the US dollar (at one point in the past 20 years it was down to 50c), and pricing made more sense in comparison, with imported things being generally more expensive due to remoteness. Then we had a mining boom and our dollar increased in value to a peak of around US$1.12. Of course, your local prices don&#x27;t fluctuate to match the exchange rate, because it doesn&#x27;t work that way. So for a local, that bus ticket has always been the same price, but it doubled in cost for tourists. The Aussie dollar is now on the way down again. Real estate is ridiculously expensive though - most expensive in the world in relative-to-average-income terms.<p>Apparently, the volatility of the $A combined with the general stability of the economy makes it the 5th-most traded currency in the world (US$, Euro, Yen, GB pound, then $A... the middle order might be a bit mixed up)",1389153457

I will never believe that it saved them money when compared to a well run physical infrastructure that was more purpose built for what they do, but they did not demonstrate the ability to run a physical infrastructure well so it&#x27;s kind of moot.<p>It worked out great for them and gave Adrian some great stories to share.

I for one am very concerned indeed. That does not mean in any way that I can&#x27;t appreciate some of the benefits (it seems to make electronic communication for the common user very easy, it seems, for example), but I also see large risks, and I think there are alternatives from the technical perspective that should be able to provide much the same benefits without the risks, which is why I think that society should probably try to get rid of Facebook, at least the way it currently functions.",1389152478

Americans are less healthy than other countries but it&#x27;s not because we don&#x27;t spend enough on care. It&#x27;s because we depend too much on health insurance to make us healthy.<p>To me if health care is broken in the U.S., it is broken for two reasons:  1. medical coverage is tied to employment and 2.  economic considerations are removed from the equation by insurance companies.<p>My two fixes to U.S. health care would be to allow (through de-regulation or regulation, whichever it requires) allow consumers to shop for healthcare based on their own desires for coverage (extreme catastrophic coverage, e.g. only cover procedures over $50K, all the way down to full coverage of toe nail clipping and nose wiping) without ties to their employer.  This fix would remove the pre-existing condition problem. It is one solution the new healthcare exchanges attempt to provide.<p>To fix the second problem, I think health insurance companies and medical facilities should be required to show their prices for all treatments and procedures. If my health insurance will pay up to $5K for me to have my appendix removed and there is a doctor that I trust who will remove it for $250.00, I should be able to choose that doctor and my insurance premiums should reflect the choices that I make with my coverage.<p>If health care were handled like this, people could save thousands of dollars on their health coverage by making responsible decisions about what types of coverage to get and how much to spend on treatment.

Pay for RHEL or switch distros. This really sucked b/c RHL deployments were largely servers that were designed for long term deployments. The community was faced with a large scale migration of servers which involved a large population of web and edge of network deployments.<p>This is when CentOS stepped in, created a binary compatible build of RHEL, and allowed long time RHL users to continue with a RedHat-like distro.<p>RedHat has been a major contributor to OSS. However, projects like CentOS have filled very important roles in the Linux and OSS communities. Again, congrats to the team.",1389151327

The food scene is okay, but it&#x27;s hard to get just normal good greasy spoon food without having to find out more than you want to know about the meal. Seattle is nicer is almost every way and has more to do and a far better tech scene.<p>Baltimore is a hell hole and I wouldn&#x27;t miss it if it sunk into the ocean tomorrow. I grew up not far from it and avoid it like the plague. It&#x27;s one of the saddest U.S. cities outside of Detroit. I&#x27;d say the same about D.C., but it&#x27;s improved tremendously in the last 20 years and is actually not a bad city these days. It&#x27;s not as nice as modern NYC, but it&#x27;s getting there.<p>Having done lots of global travel, including to Australia. I&#x27;d say the bits of Australia that I&#x27;ve been to (NSW) were &quot;fine&quot;. It feels very &quot;American&quot; in lots of ways, but different -- like an episode of Sliders. Public transportation was even worse than the lousy standards of the U.S., if that&#x27;s believable, and everything from real estate to food was terribly overpriced. But it had a nice feel to the place, people were friendly enough and there&#x27;s a better fitness culture than in the States if that&#x27;s important -- it&#x27;s not to me. The big spaces between the cities were full of the same kind of redneck you find in the big spaces between cities anywhere and only appeal to people who like farming and dust. As an American I could see moving to Australia for a couple years maybe.<p>Europe has nice bits and &quot;meh&quot; parts as well...even in Western Europe. Growing up in one of the most cultural diverse places in the world, the lack of cultural variety in lots of areas in continental Europe is kind of boring. Unless you count Kebabs and Chinese takeout as culture. London can service this if you need but it&#x27;s about the only really strongly diverse multi-cultural city in Europe that&#x27;s on the scale of the typical American city. The racial segregation in most of Europe makes Chicago look like a well integrated city. Europe offers good health insurance, and excellent local food (even if the variety isn&#x27;t very good). But you also get high taxes, a difficult labor environment and in general an anti-risk anti-entrepreneurial environment.<p>The Middle East is well...it is what it is. A couple nice cities in a very difficult socio-economic environment with one industry. Depending on how you count it (European or Central Asia), lots of Turkey is actually pretty nice.<p>I count Russia as its own thing. Cities are pretty new like Asia, industry is highly focused like the Middle East, people can be very friendly once you get to know them, and then everybody&#x27;s miserable anyways.<p>TBH These days I&#x27;d rather live in one of the newer Asian mega cities: Tokyo, Seoul, Beijing, Hong Kong, Singapore etc. Nicer places to live, better quality of life, more to do, and everything&#x27;s newer so it&#x27;s in better shape. Public transport is out of this world, and food is generally plentiful and cheap. People are fine as well in most places. Crime is also low and medical care is stupid cheap even if it&#x27;s not universal. Most of Asia is also highly entrepreneurial with nearly everybody trying to start a business of some sort.<p>U.S. is big, varied, cities are generally metropolitan, lots of different industries to work in. The countryside drops down the socio-economic ladder very quickly. Pockets of extreme religiosity can be annoying but are easy to avoid. But it&#x27;s medium-high entrepreneurial tendencies and high risk acceptance and well regulated banking system make doing business reasonably pain free. Health care costs are absurd, sometimes even with insurance. Food is of a high variety, even if much of it is second rate. Local American cuisine is generally contemptible, but pockets of traditional american greatness exist in the food world. Clothes and goods are cheap and plentiful and of unimaginable variety. In most of the country real estate prices vary considerably within short distances. Public transport outside of a few cities is almost third world.",1389151290

7021455,comment,7018819,7019531,8,0,gcr,,,"(Edit: Oops! Sorry, I see that you&#x27;re already familiar with continuations, but let me explain them for those who aren&#x27;t)<p>Sometimes, fundamental switches in thinking are worth it. :)<p>For example, continuations would be <i>perfect</i> here, and are a wonderful tool for simplifying &quot;nested callback hell&quot; type problems.<p>But why should a web developer care about continuations?<p>Consider Paul Graham&#x27;s Arc challenge: Build a web page that presents a form to the user. After they submit the form, a new page presents them with a link. The link takes them to a third page where the submitted value is presented back to the user. The restriction is that the input field must not be passed in via the URL.<p>Right now, the user must write in &quot;continuation-passing style&quot;, which means threading callbacks, like this:<p><pre><code>   function serve(req,res) {\n      askUserForValue(req,res, function(value){\n          showLink(req, res, function(){\n              render(res, {&quot;user-value&quot;: value});\n          });\n      });\n   }\n</code></pre>\nOr perhaps the user could somehow stuff the variable into a &quot;session&quot; library with three separate URL routes:<p><pre><code>    function serve(req,res) {\n       render the form with the POST action of /submit;\n    }\n\n    function submit(req,res, value) {\n       req.session[&quot;uservalue&quot;] = value;\n       render the link that sends the user to /view;\n    }\n\n    function view(req,res) {\n       render the value of req.session[&quot;uservaule&quot;];\n    }\n</code></pre>\nThis one is even more fragmented since you have three separate functions that model one user interaction flow! I certainly like it less than the callback example -- at least I can keep one in my head.<p>We can do better though. Continuations let you write this:<p><pre><code>   function serve(req, res) {\n      var value = askUserForValue();\n      showLink();\n      render(res, {&quot;user-value&quot;: value});\n   }\n</code></pre>\nIf node.js supported continuations, the askUserForValue() function would respond with the form and <i>suspend</i> the serve function right then and there. After the user made a new HTTP call, the suspended askUserForValue() call would return to serve() and its return value would be placed into our variable. Then, the showLink() function could render the link and <i>suspend</i> the function again. Once the user makes another HTTP request, the function resumes, and so on.<p>The server would have to store the <i>state of the computation itself</i> to disk so it could <i>continue</i> later.<p>With continuations, we can pretend the user&#x27;s web browser is the program counter. This frees my mind up. First, I don&#x27;t have to keep callbacks in my head since there aren&#x27;t any callbacks anymore. Second, stack traces work the way I expect because functions explicitly call each other. Third, if askForValue() throws an exception if the user inputs a string where I entered a number, no problem! Just wrap it in a try{} block that asks the user to enter a valid value, <i>as if I&#x27;m writing a text program that calls readline().</i><p>Also note that this is different from just letting each user interaction be in its own thread! Consider:<p>1. Continuations should be serializable to disk. You wouldn&#x27;t want blocked threads to just pile up as more users visit your website, and if your server crashes, you certainly wouldn&#x27;t want to forget their state.<p>2. The browser &quot;back&quot; button would have to <i>step a program backwards in time</i>; something that is unsupported in a naïve thread-equals-user-interaction system. (E.g. how many of you have booked an airplane ticket with Travelocity/Expedia/whatever, pressed &quot;Back&quot;, and then got a big error because the server didn&#x27;t know how to step backwards through its user stack?) But the ability to save continuations to disk is the ability to save the current state of the program to disk, which makes stepping back in time easy: you can simply reload what was about to happen, just like savestates in a video game emulator.<p>This is not a new idea. Many Common Lisp and Smalltack web frameworks work well with continuations and have done so for years (the first Seaside release was 2002, I&#x27;m not kidding you!)<p>Racket, a great dialect of Scheme, ships with such a web framework out of the box. Here&#x27;s my implementation of the Arc challenge in Racket.

Just download Racket from <a href""http://racket-lang.org"" rel""nofollo"">http://racket-lang.org/</a> , copy+paste the code into DrRacket&#x27;s giant text box on the top, press Run, and your web browser will pop up with the example.",1389151259

What would be better for the tax payer?</i><p>Red pill alert.<p>Your doctor accepting insurance is not guaranteed, or even likely, these days. As insurance companies become more aggressive against doctors, an increasing number are either deciding not to put up with that bullshit at all (in New York, half the doctors don&#x27;t take insurance at all because there are enough richies) or to only accept a couple of plans (which you won&#x27;t get, unless your company is union and the union does a hell of a job). Companies often buy cheapskate insurance where the network is thin, and you may need a specialist but be unable to get one (in network) for several months, or have to drive 100 miles. In an emergency, you pay a lot out of pocket. Possibly $20,000+. That&#x27;s <i>with insurance</i>.<p>Most plans also have high deductibles ($2000+) these days, which means that the first $2000 of expenses you will pay. There&#x27;s typically an exemption for an annual physical and for routine stuff, but getting seriously sick is beyond what most Americans can afford.<p>Oh, and if you have to buy individual insurance (your employer isn&#x27;t big enough to get a group plan) then you will be paying a hell of a lot more than $200 per month for it. If you&#x27;ve ever had a serious illness, make it $2,500 per month. Cancer survivors are uninsurable if seeking individual plans (chemotherapy is carcinogenic, believe it or not). Diabetics are fucked.<p>Finally, if you deal with anxiety or depression or panic attacks (hey, it happens) you will get a lot of pushback from health insurance, even on unrelated claims, because statistically people with MH issues (especially depression) are more likely to just give up and eat losses, or fuck up on paperwork and eat losses, on claims that the insurer should technically pay.<p>American health insurance is, with no exaggeration, a 9/11 every 24 days. 45,000 per year.

The current system grants them monopolies, and fails to regulate them appropriately. This is exactly the wrong way round. But this is the problem with politicians: monopoly provides concentration of cash, and this can be tapped into far more efficiently from the perspective of political exploitation. Its much easier to garner a donation from a rich individual with concentrated cash, than many individuals. Likewise, its much easier tax a few firms or not with tax {X} in return for special favours. Its much harder to garner the support of the diffuse and middle classes (not to mention, even get/keep their attention).

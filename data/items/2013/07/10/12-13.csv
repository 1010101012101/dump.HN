Imagine a simplified version of EC2 as per [1], which fits 12 small instances on one physical host, and you could therefore be wasting 11 slots that you could run a m1.small in. They can&#x27;t sell these to any other customer.  If you buy a second instance, they put that on your first host; you are now wasting  10 slots. Carry on down to when you fill up your first host and spill over onto a second, back to wasting 11 slots.<p>Previously they were charging $10/hour for those wasted 11 slots, which you could have filled by paying 72.6c/hr.

Snacks, more like. For example, a day could look like:<p>- Breakfast: x2 small boiled eggs, cup of green tea, 1 teaspoon sugar<p>- Mid-morning: Banana, cup of coffee<p>- Dinner: Chicken and pasta meal (brown pasta)<p>- Evening snack: toasted ham and cheese sandwich (wholemeal bread)<p>This will comfortably last me the day without hunger pangs. I won&#x27;t necessarily <i>strictly</i> follow this every single day, this is a rough guide. The overall point is regularly spaced out meals, before I get ravenous and eat crap food, with as little processed food and sugar as possible.<p>> Study after study says that calorie counting diets work great for the first several months, up to a year.\nAnd then by year five, only a tiny fraction of people are still doing it, and the rest have gained back all their weight and then some.\nMaybe you will beat the odds. I do think that many HN readers are more likely than the general population to succeed this way -- geeks are better at living inside number-based systems of rules. Good luck.<p>I don&#x27;t think of it as a calorie counting diet. The whole point of calorie counting is a temporary measure (perhaps for a month or two total), more as a mental trick to make me realise the shit I was shovelling absently mindedly into my body every day. After a few weeks, I&#x27;ll be able to roughly gauge the calories simply by memory, and hopefully be in a good habit of small regular healthy meals by then.",1373460704

Long hetereogeneous lists and vectors are not particularly useful because they cannot be reduced/folded -- unless your reducing function accounts for all the different types but then why not use an algebraic data type with pattern matching?",1373460344

I&#x27;m pointing out that there&#x27;s an upfront component (say $1614 for a m3.2xlarge) to the reserved instance pricing - which is likely of interest to startups. Amazon calls this an &quot;upfront payment&quot;...I don&#x27;t think &quot;upfront cost&quot; is a misrepresentation.<p>This cost tends to be better than buying hardware, but it&#x27;s much higher than what you pay for dedicated (often $0 upfront...or $25-$200).",1373457747

My Hetzner server has had solid service for about 18 months now (with a couple of brief restarts in there) and certainly no prolonged outages.<p>I am not particularly keen to move entirely to them, however, as I just have a gut feeling I&#x27;d prefer to have the service of someone like Linode in a true emergency. As a high powered server for experiments, side projects or things that don&#x27;t demand 100% uptime (e.g. my company&#x27;s collaboration software), however, Hetzner has proven superb so far.",1373457747

6018871,comment,6018521,6018769,5,0,pron,,,"I&#x27;m not saying that your view is wrong, but I should point out that it neuters almost every kind of political action.<p>Almost every undertaking is carried out by a large group of people. Most of them are  innocent. All of them are probably nice. But bad things are often done by nice people -- sometimes because they don&#x27;t realize that they&#x27;re bad. Sometimes because they don&#x27;t care enough. There are no bond-villains in real life. People who do evil don&#x27;t think that that&#x27;s what they&#x27;re doing.<p>A possibly controversial example relevant to this forum is Google. I&#x27;m personally convinced that Google is one of the most sinister and &quot;evil&quot; (to use their own parlance) corporations that has ever existed, and I can support that claim (though I won&#x27;t be doing that now). Yet, I know that not only are most Google employees really nice and innocent, even their top management has the best of intentions. Still, Google is evil.<p>Once you understand that good intentions often lead to evil actions, you get a different understanding of political action. Precisely because many people have participated in the making of this film, it is important to boycott it (if you agree with the boycotter&#x27;s arguments). Otherwise, people will always have the defense of &quot;but I&#x27;m just an actor&quot;, or &quot;I didn&#x27;t know&quot;. Everything we do is a political statement, and ignoring that fact is a political statement in itself, which says &quot;I don&#x27;t care about the message my work sends, I only care about my career&quot;.<p>Maybe if you boycott the film, those innocent actors will learn that next time they should make it their business to learn who they&#x27;re working for.",1373457630

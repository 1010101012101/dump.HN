Sometimes we don&#x27;t.<p>The Googling of answers has caused many problems with vocabulary words, where the words have slightly (or even vastly) different applications to different domains.<p>If she gets something wrong, she quickly moves onto the next subject without much reflection, because homework is usually graded on completeness (rather than accuracy).  From what she says, they rarely review homework in class, so they never revisit subject areas that are problematic.<p>My #1 criticism with homework is that it&#x27;s a tool that is used for reenforcement, but that sometimes the wrong methods/ideas/facts are reenforced.",1425499175

A pure reactive system will work for that.<p>I used to say that a key component of AI that was missing was the ability to get through the next few seconds of life without falling down or bumping into anything.  I went through Stanford CS when the top-down logicians were in charge of AI. That approach was totally incapable of dealing with the real world.  Now we&#x27;re seeing the systems needed to deal with the real world in the short term starting to work.<p>Once you can deal with the next few seconds, a strategy module can be added to give goals to the low level system.  This is very clear in the video game context.  As the game playing programs advance beyond the 2D full-screen games, they&#x27;ll need a low-level system to handle the next moves (&quot;don&#x27;t fall off platform&quot;, &quot;jump to next platform&quot;, &quot;shoot at target&quot; are primitives for the 2D sidescroller era) and some level of planner to handle tactical matters and strategy.<p>It&#x27;s possible to explicitly build hierarchical systems like that now, using classical planning techniques to modify the goals of a machine learning system.  It&#x27;s not yet possible to get a hierarchical system to emerge from machine learning.  Medium term planning as an emergent behavior is a near term big challenge for AI.<p>Beyond such a two-level system, we&#x27;re going to need intercommunicating components that do different parts of the problem. The components may be evolved, while the architecture may be designed.  When AI systems can design such architectures, they&#x27;re probably ready to take over.",1425498631

I believe it was mostly broken into 1-2, 3-5, 6-8.<p>The teacher for one of the rooms would have to break up the day to teach separate sub-sets of the room their own lessons. This wound up leaving ample time to work solo and in small groups on assignments.  I rarely had to make schoolwork into homework.<p>While it was certainly a lot of work for the teacher to juggle, it also prevented them from trying to consume too much of the students time with active instruction.  This is contrasted to the typical high school scenario where students are bounced between multiple rooms throughout the day where each teacher sees that they only have 40-60 minutes to cram their lesson through.<p>I don&#x27;t think I can emphasize enough how important it was to be to be able to work on my 8th grade algebra homework on a couch cushion in the back of the room while other kids were doing their science lesson.<p>Obviously the shared room model is directly akin to modern open office layouts which are chaotic and can be confusing even for well leveled people.<p>I think my point is that kids should have plenty of unstructured time to do the vast majority (if not all) of their work at school.",1425498622

At the extreme end, where anyone could call a vote any time and your &#x27;vote unit&#x27; would beep at you, give you the summary of the question and ask you to put your thumb on &#x27;yay&#x27; or &#x27;nay&#x27;, not only would you find yourself sitting there with this thing going off constantly, the rules and regulations would change so quickly that nobody would be able to reliably follow them, even if they wanted to.<p>Under damped voting systems can oscillate out of control to self destruction just as effectively as circuits can.<p>But once you start down this path, what you&#x27;ll really start to uncover is how the institutions of government are designed to work. So its a great place to start.",1425498569

Test the market. Get 5 paying customers, <i>then</i> start thinking about quitting your full time job.<p>So, some feedback...<p>From what I gather, OpenLoop a tool for me to organize information and/or projects, generic enough to be used across many verticals and company orgs.

I&#x27;m not sure if my view is accurate, but that&#x27;s what I feel like you&#x27;re trying to sell.<p>&quot;Show, don&#x27;t tell&quot;. Go look at trello.com. Go look at basecamp.com/tour. As a potential customer, I want to see screenshots of the software before I signup. I want to see what&#x27;s different. I&#x27;m asking myself &quot;is this worth my time?&quot; Show me a gif of OpenLoop in action. Or make a short screencast (with actual video of the software, not a high-level animation) and stick it right in the hero. Put up a demo at demo.openlooopz.com. Automatically wipe/reimage the account every night to keep out spam and vulgarity. Let people play with it.<p>Explore verticals. Are there verticals currently using OpenLoop really well? Project Managers? Nurses? Accountants? Is it really great at bug tracking? Highlight those on your website - &quot;Project Managers use OpenLoop to Deliver Great Products&quot;, &quot;Squash bugs quickly with OpenLoop&quot;. Build some dedicated landing pages for those verticals and buy some FB ads. Measure pageviews/signups and see who is most interested.<p>Testimonials or Case Studies. Talk to people currently using OpenLoop and ask them for a quote to put on your page.<p>Blogs. Setup a tumblr in 15 seconds and start blogging about how people are using OpenLoop. Publish guides on popular workflows. Publish ways you&#x27;re different than your competitors.<p>Refine your copy. People generally don&#x27;t read large blocks of text.

If you can, take a 2 week break from anything OpenLoop related (perhaps a contract) and spend time with your family.

The best way to do so depends heavily on the type of company you&#x27;re talking about and who wants to know the information, but many companies choose to keep multiple sets of books--one that follows the IRS&#x27;s rules (this one is required), one that follows the SEC&#x27;s rules (required if they are a publicly traded corporation), one for non-public investors, and one used internally allows management to make strategic decisions and departments to make plans.<p>The existence of various ways of considering the finances of a corporation don&#x27;t necessarily mean that any one method is &quot;wrong&quot;. But when you get into questions of &quot;is it profitable?&quot; The answer depends a lot on who&#x27;s asking.<p>In any one month, more money may go out of your checking account than came in, but does that mean you lost money that month? Maybe some of the outgoing money was paying for a year&#x27;s worth of an expensive service, or was an investment in some other company, or was the purchase of some assets that will allow you to become more productive. In those cases, while your cash flow may be negative, you can keep a set of books that spreads the cost of a year&#x27;s worth of service over the entire year, even if you pay it all at once on January 1. Or a building you might want to spread the cost out over the duration of any loans you took out to pay for part of it, or if you paid cash, you still may want to spread the expense out over the 15 year expected lifetime of the asset.<p>Obviously the IRS and SEC rules have to be pretty standard across the board, but within any particular industry or business model, a different representation may provide investors or management with a more accurate picture than the IRS or SEC rules would allow.<p>Obviously all of these can be abused, and investors should be skeptical and do due diligence, but even 100% honest businesses may report a loss to the IRS, a profit to investors, and a break-even for the SEC.

9146709,comment,9145197,9146318,0,0,boredandroid,,,"I really think there are a couple of levels of immutability that it is easy to conflate.<p>Specifically immutability for<p>1. In memory data structures...this is the contention of the functional programming people.<p>2. Persistent data stores. This is the lsm style of data structure that substitutes linear writes and compaction for buffered in-place mutation.<p>3. Distributed system internals--this is a log-centric, &quot;state machine replication&quot; style of data flow between nodes. This is a classic approach in distributed databases, and present in systems like PNUTs.<p>4. Company-wide data integration and processing around streams of immutable records between systems. This is what I have argued for (<a href=""http://engineering.linkedin.com/distributed-systems/log-what-every-software-engineer-should-know-about-real-time-datas-unifying"" rel=""nofollow"">http://engineering.linkedin.com/distributed-systems/log-what...</a>) and I think Martin is mostly talking about.<p>There are a lot of analogies between these but they aren&#x27;t the same. Success of one of these things doesn&#x27;t really imply success for any of the others. Functional programming could lose and log-structured data stores could win or vice versa. Pat Helland has made an across the board call for immutability (<a href=""http://www.cidrdb.org/cidr2015/Papers/CIDR15_Paper16.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cidrdb.org/cidr2015/Papers/CIDR15_Paper16.pdf</a>), but that remains a pretty strong assertion. So it is worth being specific about which level you are thinking about.<p>For my part I am pretty bullish about stream processing and data flow between systems being built around a log or stream of immutable records as the foundational abstraction. But whether those systems internally are built in functional languages, use lsm style data layout on disk is kind of an implementation detail. From my point of view immutability is a lot more helpful in the large than in the small--I have never found small imperative for loops particularly hard to read, but process-wide mutable state is a big pain, and undisciplined dataflow between disparate systems, caches, and applications at the company level can be a real disaster.",1425497431

9146657,comment,9146034,9146034,0,0,amyjess,,,"This subject is one that interests me a lot.<p>As I&#x27;ve mentioned before (in fact, I created this account to post about it a few weeks ago), I&#x27;m MtF transgender, and it&#x27;s been my observation and the observation of the trans communities I participate in that a disproportionately high percentage of MtF trans people work in the tech industry and/or are tech hobbyists. The &quot;MtF computer geek&quot; is in fact one of the most prevalent -- and in my experience, <i>one of the most true</i> -- stereotypes of trans people I&#x27;ve seen.<p>I&#x27;m reminded of the old Russian meme, where one person wanders into an anime IRC channel and asks &quot;Hello, is this an anime channel?&quot;, followed by &quot;How do I patch KDE2 under FreeBSD?&quot;. It became a popular meme because it&#x27;s true: anime fans tend to be computer geeks. I&#x27;ve also seen this same exact joke posted in trans communities, by the way...<p>(Oh, and lest I forget, a huge chunk of the trans community is into anime, too.)<p>There is something about certain characteristics that heavily draws people to the tech industry.<p>If you&#x27;re trans? If you like anime? If you play sports like Ultimate and rock climbing? You&#x27;re probably a techie.<p>Honestly, I&#x27;ve noticed that for many of these (e.g. anime, Ultimate), the inverse is true as well, and if being trans wasn&#x27;t hard-wired and such a tiny, tiny minority of the population (most estimates I&#x27;ve heard are around 0.3%), I&#x27;d bet a huge amount of techies would be trans.<p>I think of all the theories OP proposed, the most likely one is that &quot;programmer culture&quot; is a distinct subculture much like e.g., &quot;academic culture&quot;.<p>Of course, there are a few reasons for that. If you look at ESR&#x27;s &quot;A Portrait of J. Random Hacker&quot; (<a href=""http://www.catb.org/jargon/html/appendixb.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.catb.org/jargon/html/appendixb.html</a>), he absolutely nails a personality type that goes into some of this. The section on sports, for example, goes into how hackers are drawn to sports that focus on self-discipline and technical ability.<p>Another is that tech stuff is looked down upon by society. Mainstream society sees us as weirdos to be shunned. You know who else societies see that way? Anime fans. Trans people. By and large, all three communities are very accepting of cultural differences. For example, techies will happily accept trans people into their communities because they know what it&#x27;s like to be marginalized. And I think LGBT people are more likely to hang out with communities focused on marginalized hobbies than other minorities, because of how we&#x27;re perceived. Racial and ethnic minorities are set apart because of how they look and sound. LGBT people, on the other hand, are set apart because of what we do, and &quot;set apart for what we do&quot; is also a good description of how techies and anime fans are separated from mainstream culture.",1425496939

Running dog-Thing was played by Jed, a half wolf that neither growled nor barked. Richard Masur, who played the station dog handler, remembers how Jed would just give you “that look” when he grew uncomfortable on the set. That Thing look. So watch Jed closely. Watch Jed pad down empty hallways. Jed nosing the door open, looking out of windows. Jed listening to Stevie Wonder.<p>> In the film, Wilford Brimley’s Dr. Blair supposes this while performing an autopsy on Norwegian Two-faced Thing, his eraser head traveling directly from an astro-parasitic entity to his own bottom lip. A clear violation of Thing health code.<p>> Rob Bottin, who played the ghost of a vengeful seagoing leper in The Fog, was in charge of special effects for The Thing. ... Bottin would do such a thorough job—literally ending up inside the Thing, for the finale—that he’d check himself into a hospital after the shoot completed.<p>> Meanwhile, I’m left wondering if the Thing can retain the dream memories of those it absorbs, turning to Freaks and Geeks for answers. For it was the great leveler Millie Kentner who once cried, “Life is not that dog’s dream!”<p>I was able to follow the author&#x27;s meaning in parts but it&#x27;s certainly challenging.",1425496391

There&#x27;s some merit to the argument that it&#x27;s much riskier and probably more expensive for the cartels to kidnap and hold these people than to pay them enough to work voluntarily. The main argument against that is how many people have disappeared with no contact with their families, and that the families aren&#x27;t getting any money. But then, we don&#x27;t know where these people are, what they&#x27;re doing, and what degree, if any, of coercion is being applied.<p>The wild card is the Governments&#x27; unwillingness to even acknowledge the problem. That suggests that it embarrasses them. What&#x27;s more embarrassing to the government, though? That the cartels might be powerful enough to kidnap people at will all over their country? Doesn&#x27;t sound particularly newsworthy or worthy of suppression, considering what else is going on there. How about the extent to which upper-middle class educated people are willingly working with the cartels to build high-end infrastructure? I could see that being very embarrassing indeed. It makes it seem like the cartels are inching closer to being the legitimate government of major parts of the country. That sounds much more like something worth denying and suppressing.

Even if someone&#x27;s home connection can theoretically maintain 45k tx/s, how many of those generous full node maintainers out there will be excited about the prospect of their Bitcoin node using their entire internet connection? Storage requirements will also still be fairly intensive, even if nodes prune everything but the UTXO set (that needs to be stored in RAM--although that can change--it&#x27;s a half gig).<p>Not to mention that proposal can create problems where miners withhold transactions from other miners so they can build secret chains that other miners can&#x27;t build on until they have see the withheld transactions.<p>All that aside, your comment still ignores the reality of the situation.

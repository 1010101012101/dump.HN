583356,comment,583159,583159,0,0,unexpected,,,"If you find school really boring, that's okay 99% of the rest of your high school population does too.<p>What you should not do:<p>1) Dropout.\n2) Make bad grades.\n3) Skip classes.<p>If you find school boring, at the very least make sure you dominate it. You're at an age where you have infinite possibilities before you- Kick school completely in the ass to make sure you don't close off all those opportunities.<p>The kids who drop-out/make terrible grades in school because it was ""too easy"" for them end up creating more obstacles for themselves. Yes, you might not need a HS Diploma to get a cool comp sci job, but it is certainly much easier to get a startup job if you graduated summa cum laude from Stanford than if you dropped out of high school.<p>The truly smart, great, inspirational people are good at multiple things- they often say that the best programmers are also the best communicators. They also great grasp of their underlying subject matter (which might not matter if you're working at youtube, but would be relevant if you're working at a bioinformatics startup, etc.)<p>You're going to want to be good at multiple things. As much as you love programming now, you don't know what might happen in the future. When I was in 10th grade, I still wanted to be a doctor! So, don't close off any doors by throwing in the towel. If it's too easy for you, just dominate it.<p>If you still understand what I'm saying, let's make a sports analogy. Imagine LeBron James in H.S. He's head and shoulders ahead above the competition. There's no reason he should be playing. He probably could have turned pro at 15; however if he had been bored, tanked through games, not tried, he would have been labeled as a ""me-first"" player who didn't play his heart out, and he wouldn't have the same opportunities he had today.<p>So, play your heart out in high school. Life exists beyond books. As I've said in my other posts, achieve your genetic potential- not only academically, but socially, and physically as well. Develop habits that will last you a lifetime: self-discipline. strong character and ethics. stand up to the bullies. support the other geeks. build loyalty and true friendships. identify your insecurities, and blast them away.<p>Treat high school as an experience, not as a place to go to learn- you've mastered the learning part (at least you better by getting rockstar grades), make a good effort to master the rest.<p>If you think high school is boring, wait till you enter the real world. For 95% of us, the boring 9 am lecture is replace by the boring 9 am meeting. At least your class is over in 45 minutes, and if you're lucky, you can pass notes to the cute girl sitting next to you. My 9 am meetings sometimes last 2 hours and its a room of all males.<p>Even if you're in a startup, you'll face tedium. Fights with your board. Fights with your investors. Accounting (bleh). Trying to protect your IP by filing a patent. A lot of that stuff is tedious and boring.<p>A lot of times in life, you'll be faced with tedious, repetitious tasks. Having the self-discipline to power through these, as well as making lemonade from lemons- I learned these skills in high school!",1240934333
583355,comment,582691,583319,0,0,rorymarinich,,,"I think that the porn thing was pretty tasteless on the part of the presenter. But a part of being civil is avoiding confrontations that you don't have to be in. I used to feel really uncomfortable attending religious services because I was an atheist, for instance, but I've come to the conclusion that while it's awful to lie about what you believe, it's pretty icky to force your beliefs on other people. So while I think that the presenter and DHH are being kind of obnoxious, I accept that DHH's good traits stem from that obnoxious attitude, and I can like his product without necessarily liking that attitude.<p>It also depends on what you mean by ""insulting."" Frankly, if a cute girl asks me to program, then I will almost certainly tease her as I help out. I think the porn thing was an attempt at tease that ended up being a bit too insulting. There's definitely a line, but usually if you cross that line people will understand so long as you do.",1240934290

I'm guessing you don't learn much in math or science, because you learn that stuff at a faster pace than your peers. But in English, even if the classroom discussions are banal, you're probably reading some interesting literature. You must be doing Shakespeare sometimes. Even if it doesn't seem like your thing -- especially then -- try to read the hell out of it, to get as deep as you can into the text and its complexities. (This has nothing to do with 'liking' it.)

I've also been interning over the past year at a well known company in the tech sector.  It's been a lot of work, but it has also paid off.  I've learned a ton and haven't gotten bored.  When things get dull in regular high school classes (basically when I go to class), I do homework or program.<p>If I hadn't done the dual-enrollment program, I would have probably taken the proficiency exam and gone to a community college.

People who take things that other people say and extend them to drastic proportions just so they can be dicks about it.<p><i>No</i>, we're not going to have egalitarian bliss. We're human beings. We have flaws. Those flaws won't go away. My ""solution"" is one that I think would work better than the endless ""be diverse"" speeches kids get. I think that it might make a lot of smart people a lot happier. It won't fix everything, but it might at least <i>help</i>. But no, you won't address the ideas I put forth. You'll nitpick. You'll be an absolute snot just so that you can gain the upper hand in an argument. And so you might reach a point where I and people like me get tired of your bullshit and walk away, and then you'll declare yourself the victor because you were the last person to make a post in my comment thread, but all you're doing is making the person on the other side want to punch yourself in the face. In a microcosm, that's my essay: you're probably not a stupid person, but you're deliberately avoiding facts to paint a one-sided portrayal of what I'm saying, and it's pissing me off. If we were having this argument in real life and I was a more naturally violent person, I'd probably hit you, and then in your eyes I'd become the bully and you wouldn't be guilty of anything. That's the problem here, and it's incredibly common amongst programmers, and it sucks.<p><i>I have no problem with that. But they are not responsible for the crimes committed by others.</i><p>They're <i>interconnected</i>. You're like the American attitude after 9/11 that terrorists were wholly evil Satanic creatures with no motive. I'm arguing back and saying that the people on the other side <i>are</i> doing bad things, but that that's a <i>separate issue</i> from what I'm talking about. If you're guilty about being arrogant and annoying, then when you get teased and beaten up it's not causeless. <i>You caused this.</i> And the other side is more at fault then you are, but don't act like you're a saint.<p><i>Should battered wives admit that they are partially at fault because they annoyed their husbands?</i><p>If you get beaten and do nothing about it, it's your fault that it goes on. See, <i>two sides of the same struggle can both be guilty</i>. The husband is more at fault, but if the battered wife acts like there's nothing she can do then she's to blame for it going on.<p>Same with rape. If you get raped and do nothing about it, you're letting the other guy get away. The other guy isn't innocent. This isn't a blame game where it's the victim's fault entirely. But the victim does not exist in a vacuum, and the fact that the problem still exists suggests that in some way the victim is complicit about the problem.<p>Is McDonald's to blame for making people fat? Partly. But they exist to provide something for people who are asking for it. Fat people are to blame for their being fat. Perhaps not entirely 100% to blame, but they can stop themselves, and they're not, and so it's partly their fault.<p>One day I might write something about how much bullies suck, but other people are already doing this. I don't like being generic. So I thought I would write a little thing about how nerds are often partially to blame for their oppression, and that they refuse to take responsibility for themselves, not expecting anybody to submit it to a place where people like you would get to spray their spittle around without ever once addressing what I'm saying.",1240933030

The power of this (for me) is that you can separate constraints in any way you like, and combine them however you like. This is important when you need to simplify a problem into parts, in order to be able to understand it one bit at a time (it's still an art to know <i>how</i> to divide up the problem, but maths gives you options).<p>It's very appealing (and obvious) step to then execute these declared constraints - that is, to code directly in terms of the mathematics.<p>But here's the problem: the maths doesn't tell you <i>the</i> answer; it just tells you its constraints. The answer you want is somewhere in that space. Of course, it's possible to write a language that will always give you <i>an</i> from within that space. The most well-known way for this issue to show up is in efficiency: the solution given by the language does fall within the constraints, but it takes too long. If we had a way to declare the efficiency as a constraint, this might change... but apparently that's a hard one.\nOther constraints are things like: usability, understandability (to coders of average ability, average education and average deadlines), interoperability with standards (which are never ideal, but which exist and which work), portability, modularity and many others that I haven't encountered or imagined.<p>Partly the difficulty is in specifying a soft, human constraint in formal terms; the other part is solving for that constraint, which appears to require strong AI or bump up against the halting problem - or else we could just declare the constraint: ""fastest possible solution"".",1240932986

He's just saying this as a leader. He's saying this as DHH, a rude dude who loves to be crude. The fact that he's the leader is entirely apart from the fact that he's saying this.

Bill Gates is stupid because Windows is ugly. Jason Fried is a jackass who never does work because other people waste their time reading SvN archives.

583232,comment,582691,583160,0,0,rorymarinich,,,"To be completely honest, if I were to go back to elementary school and look at when I first started being divided from other kids, I'm almost certain it would have begun with me being an arrogant brat because of my intelligence. When you're bright, it's too tempting to try and rise above teasing by claiming superintelligence. I'm not saying that arrogance is a bad thing, but I feel that people who are persecuted for arrogance should at least admit that their own attitude is partly at fault. Of course, such an admission makes persecution less likely to happen. It's a nice circle.<p><i>Personally, I find it much more helpful not to worry about who to blame for unpopularity itself, and to focus more on what is _done_ to the unpopular. And the responsibility for that is much more clear.</i><p>To discuss a problem, you need to get to its root. The root of the problem is twofold: people on one side are too willing to ostracize themselves, and people on the other side don't want to spend time learning about people. My belief is that it's not the responsibility of others to spend time trying to understand you. I think that bullying is a problem, but frankly, if nerds were ostracized but not actively bullied I would find a hard time blaming the other kids and not the nerds. I actually discussed this problem with a professor: my solution to this problem would be twofold. First, get the other kids to realize why nerd things are cool. If people think programming is really super neato, then suddenly programmers are neato too. (It worked with math in my school: once you like math, then math geeks are pretty awesome kids. By my junior year all of the math kids hung out with the jock/class clown group.) At the same time, though, you've got to do the same in reverse. Teach the nerds to appreciate the non-nerds. Intolerance works both ways, and there are a lot of people willing to dismiss sports players or actors or musicians or artists or preps as stupid and meaningless, and what this essay's all about is that in my experience, the nerds are usually a lot less tolerant than the other people. My first day in college, when my roommate arrived, I was unpacking a virtual library, and he was carrying a volleyball, and my first impression was that we wouldn't get along because he wouldn't ""understand"" me. This year's taught me a lot about how you can be smart and not be a nerd, and I honestly think that the nerds are less aware of this than the other groups.",1240931620

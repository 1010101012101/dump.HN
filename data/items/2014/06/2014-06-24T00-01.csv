One-way databinding is still even more impoverished.<p>Unfortunately from what I can tell, ConstraintJS is just another databinding framework without an expressive general constraint solver. It really is too bad that the constraint systems that were explored in the 80s and 90s have yet to resurface (production has just made it to the 70s).",1403571563

Recall that Apple was sued by Apple Records because it made devices capable of being used &quot;in the record business&quot;.<p>> Guess Apple&#x27;s going to have to change the name of Swift because of that other programming language, amirite?<p>Interesting that you say this.  Apple certainly has a history of trademarking its languages.  Apple has trademarks on Objective-C and on AppleScript.  Its trademark on Dylan was abandoned and its trademark on Hypertalk was cancelled.  I&#x27;m guessing that Apple hasn&#x27;t trademarked Swift because it can&#x27;t: there are two many other items already named Swift in the area.  And the Swift scripting language is hardly a threat to them: it&#x27;s an NSF-funded research effort.",1403571499

7935673,comment,7932642,7933840,8,0,jrochkind1,,,"For a while, I thought Sinatra was taking that role? It might be interesting to think about what people are looking for that&#x27;s neither Sinatra nor Rails, or why Sinatra didn&#x27;t live up to what people were hoping (if people think that).<p>Sometimes I think some of this is just utopian grass-is-greener thinking. While there are _many_ things I&#x27;d do differently in Rails if I had the choice (some but certainly not all of which the Rails core team probably agrees with, if they had the chance to start over)...<p>...I think some of the &quot;the thing we need is something _lighter weight_ than Rails&quot; thinking is basically wishful thinking. When you start with something lighter weight, you (being me) generally find you need more than it offers, and then you&#x27;ve got to go finding your own things to do those things, and when these extra third party things end up not as high quality as you&#x27;d like, or end up abandoned by their developers, or you end up spending many hours re-inventing a wheel you&#x27;re sure someone else has already invented.... either the &#x27;lighter thing&#x27; ends up gaining weight, or you end up wishing it had.<p>Doesn&#x27;t mean I agree with all of Rails choices about what to include, or how to architect it. But I think people under-estimate how challenging it is to hit the sweet spots, as if Rails core team just lacked the will or intelligence or proper understanding or something, none of which I think they lack.  Still, certainly alternatives are great, testing grounds for other possible ways of doing things are great, the more different things we see, the better all of our architecting and coding gets, that&#x27;s the only way to learn.",1403571338

7935669,comment,7934548,7935487,3,0,rbehrends,,,"> The way people like to complain about the bloat and arbitrariness of C++, but then still quietly wind up using it<p>Most such people are probably in the same position that I am in, and this is that they&#x27;re using C++ primarily because they&#x27;re involved in projects with a C++ legacy codebase. Language choice really isn&#x27;t something that&#x27;s up to individual developers.<p>But for personal projects, I&#x27;ve pretty much abandoned C++, other than when I need something to bootstrap on platforms that I can&#x27;t make a whole lot of assumptions on, or when I have to operate close to the metal and C for some reason or another doesn&#x27;t fit the bill.<p>The thing is that I don&#x27;t really have a lot of beef with the language features of C++ (the way they&#x27;re used in some libraries is a different issue). The features it has are generally there for a reason, and have good rationales. And C++ does pretty well in its chosen domain (system programming). It&#x27;s not perfect (what programming language is?), but hardly terminally flawed, either.<p>But C++ simply doesn&#x27;t meet my needs. It has a very strong bias for optimizing CPU cycles, even at the cost of developer cycles, but I&#x27;m far more likely to be short on the latter than the former. Those extra few percent of speed that I might gain (or might not -- some C++ features are not all that efficient, after all) are rarely worth adding even a few hours of development time.",1403571283

Stalin&#x27;s idea was that working class is a new nobility and therefore should live as the nobility. However construction rates were so slow, that by the time Kruschev came to power people were still living in wooden barracks sharing them between multiple families.

I don&#x27;t even want that name, but I had to name the project in order to apply. It&#x27;s very likely that I&#x27;ll collaborate with the Freifunk Berlin and Project Meshnet communities.<p>What I do know, though, is which software/hardware combination I wanna explore: cjdns for routing on an end-to-end encrypted IPv6 network, Smallest Federated Wiki as an example of a federated web app, local file sharing as an example of local services, as well as something for Voice-over-IP.<p>Right now I&#x27;m preparing two small TP-Link TL-MR3020 routers (25 euros each) that won&#x27;t provide internet access directly, but instead serve a splash page with instructions and packages for the installation of cjdns on Linux and Android devices. The MR3020s run cjdns as well, and the devices will automatically peer on the Ethernet layer, without the need for traditional DHCP/IPv4. The routers have one USB port each, one will get a 3G stick for peering into cjdns&#x27; test network Hyperboria (via the Internet), and one will get a harddisk for file storage.<p>I also got my hands on a Medion Life NAS drive [2] which now runs OpenWRT and provides 2 TB of storage to any cjdns network that it gets plugged into.<p>I&#x27;d appreciate feedback regarding the application. For this call, the number of characters was strictly limited, but Call 3 (for 60,000 euros) will have a couple more detailed questions. I&#x27;m sure I can find good answers to them but this application is what I already wrote and of course I&#x27;d like to know what people think about it.<p>Also, please do vote for it, so that I actually have a chance of getting this money ;) After logging in with email or FB/Tw, a little voting form appears below the applications.

Most folks worry about getting vacuum electronics to simply work, so I couldn&#x27;t dig up anything on the nonlinearities of a vacuum transistor amplifier.  (For those who don&#x27;t follow such things:  The nonlinearities of guitar amps are intimately related to how it sounds.  Many musicians still use tube amps because the world has become accustomed to that sound.  It is the gold standard of distorted amplifiers to some of us.)<p>That said I&#x27;m not optimistic.

So the temperature of the electrons coming off the cathode are going to be much hotter.  (Another name for the monolithic vacuum devices used to be &quot;cold cathode&quot;, because it acted like a thermionic emitter but without a heater.)<p>There&#x27;s a lot that&#x27;s different.

You see, to a certain extent, the housing bubble never &quot;popped&quot; (sudden massive drop) here. Instead of being bundled into investments or handled by real estate firms, a large portion of the market is privately owned (this was driven by &quot;negative gearing&quot; that gave tax breaks etc. for ownership). Sure, the market is depressed compared to pre-GFC, but property is still astronomically overpriced. The fascinating part: the rent is <i>much</i> more reasonable. It&#x27;s like some odd market form of cognitive dissonance. The boomers refuse to believe that a crappy apartment isn&#x27;t worth 5 million dollars in the sense that they won&#x27;t sell any lower and list at that price, but at the same time they&#x27;ll signal that the &quot;real&quot; value is the much more reasonable half million by charging in rent what would be the equivalent payment for a half million on a twenty year mortgage.<p>This leads to all kinds of odd pathological situations. As far as I can tell, purely paying agents in commission is much less common here. Combined with the unmovable listing prices this has led to what is basically welfare for real estate agents and the most lackadaisical salesmen I have ever witnessed, even adjusting for the generally easy-going culture. I&#x27;m used to having to ignore calls from agents once it&#x27;s known that I&#x27;m looking. Here, it&#x27;s the opposite you have to keep calling them. I only have my current place because my wife explicitly asked about it, to which the agent responded something along the lines of, &quot;Oh yeah. That&#x27;s been open for months.&quot; Since many of the property owners aren&#x27;t professional (pooling the risk/cost of owning over many units) and cash-strapped, getting maintenance done is a nightmare. It&#x27;s either all done by themselves (with the ensuing comedy that entails) or farmed out to agencies that still bill the owner mostly piecemeal (so that every issue is a situation akin to getting your insurance to pay your doctor).<p>I would like to think that when the boomers prove, despite their thinking to the contrary, quite mortal and start dying collectively in large numbers that this will correct the market. My worry is that instead what boomers die last will use the last of their block voting power to convince the government to ease restrictions on foreign investment and Australia will become much like Hawaii.",1403568022

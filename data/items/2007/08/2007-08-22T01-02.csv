I think a single number doesn't make much sense.<p>But my intuition is that you could fairly accurately rank people by intelligence, even if the quantitative number is ill defined.<p>People are different. Some are better than others in real ways. Many criticisms of IQ I've seen start with the a priori assumption that somehow differences mean lower worth. Reduced to absurdity, this leads to accusations of neo-eugenics.<p>I don't believe that any human is worth less than another, so I have no problem saying that some people are more intelligent than others when it is obvious.<p>Here is why it really matters: if we better study intelligence, we're well suited to learn to control it. <p>Significant artificial increases in human intelligence would be as important as the computer revolution.",1187747616

When students cause undue trouble for others, just tell them why that is not acceptable and inform them they need to change their behaviour or leave.  Not as a scare measure, but so they know their situation so they can make a decision.  If they don't want to attend this school, or if causing trouble is more important for them than that, they're best out.  The main problem with behaviour in public education is that you can't ban the bullies and assholes except maybe in extreme cases.",1187745578

That is, if you hired someone to build you a bookcase you could test its craftmanship in a matter of seconds. Not the case for the startup lawyer that typically deals in Word and PDF. Therefore, it's good idea to evaluate your startup lawyer in the following ways to determine if you have found a keeper.",1187745516

There has to be some limit (x) on the number (n) of companies you can take on, making YC a x/n for 5000 + 5000founders, no?",1189612597
53881,comment,53864,53864,0,0,florianb,,,"Too many old examples,of course the West produced Newton and the fundamentals of modern science but if the West disappeared today China, Japan, South Korea, India and all the other countries would not stop scientific research.<p>To get basic research done a country has to be rich, in a poor country only applied science gets any budget. And basic research has been a state financed thing for the most parts of history. Or if you look back a bit more a privately financed gentleman hobby.<p>The table has turned now in many societies there is enough money,talent and a society liberal enough to allow a real science environment.\nThat is brilliant thing because every new researcher speeds up development and benefits the whole.

53877,comment,53746,53746,0,0,rwebb,,,"that's a good read.  he doesn't get into it too much, but the danger in declaring fund-raising season and going for broke is that if you blow your wad on the 6 VCs you know in 3 weeks and none of them bite, you just cashed in all your connections.  of course you should continue the dialog with them and ask what you they would like to see over the next period for them to be interested...but then you have a wish list from 6 vcs who might not know what's best for your business.<p>the ultimate marketing making move i have heard of is this:\n1.  give 3 firms your materials, including the amount of money you want to raise and the valuation you want to raise it at;\n2.  tell each fund that you have given the same materials to 2 other funds and that you are going to only take on the 2 funds that respond first.<p>this can work very well.  the upside is that you create leverage and massively cut down on negotiations if it works.  downside is that it can blow up in your face.  if your company isn't as great as you think it is, VCs could get pissed and tell you to screw, putting you back at square 1 with some potentially burned connections.

Perhaps that's valid criticism to an extent, but the fact is that Spielberg himself started off with a pretty lowly resume. And what are you going to say? ""Okay, you're right. My team blows. I'm replacing them with million dollar producers tomorrow.""",1189611954
53874,comment,53818,53871,0,0,Tichy,,,"I am not sure I understand: seems to me all work you have to invest initially is to fill in a one page form? Making it among the finalists, even if you don't win the grand price, you get some exposure, get to present to VCs, and hopefully have some fun. Where is the downside, except for having to make your idea public?",1189611918

No really promising startup would go through all this just for a 1/n chance of $50k.<p>This is structurally different from raising investment.  An investor tries to fund (as far as they can tell) <i>all</i> the good startups that approach them.  Here there is only one prize.  Which means the better the applicants, the more likely you're wasting your time applying.",1189611466

Labels achieve the same thing, and more flexibly, even, since the same message can show up in various places, and its read status is what it should be.<p>I use evolution for work email and use its ""vfolders"" extensively.  They have a different name, and they predate ""tagging"", but they're really the same thing, and difficult to live without.<p>In gmail, I would prefer proper threads instead of ""conversations"", but in practice the difference is minimal.<p>The crappy editor is its biggest problem, but even that can be worked around.",1189611340

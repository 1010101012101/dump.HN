It's an interesting alternative to normal essays because usually no one reads the assignment besides the TA.  Now everyone can read your homework.  Thanks for the context.",1188402995

Like the car commercial I saw last night: ""It takes a special kind of person to appreciate the <insert car name>. We call them 'Type A People'..."" And of course, you want to consider yourself a Type A person (whatever that really means), and before you know it your brain has formulated the near-unconscious idea that <i>if</i> you get the car, you'll be (or move closer to being) a Type A person.",1188402902

The bottlenecks occur when .net is paired up with IIS, and various asp.net controls and ViewState.<p>For example, we use apache with mod_mono and write our own custom controls.   ",1188401299

47843,comment,47597,47828,0,0,ratsbane,,,"According to this (<a href=""http://news.yahoo.com/s/nm/20070820/media_nm/myspace_dc_2"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.yahoo.com/s/nm/20070820/media_nm/myspace_dc_2</a>) MySpace is at about 61 million active, unique users while Facebook is at about 19 million.  Also MySpace users spend more time on the site than Facebook uses, which I'm sure translates to more traffic per user.<p>As a very unscientific test, I just logged on to my Facebook account and my Myspace account and noted the following about my home pages:<p>\n Myspace\n   html size: 16.38kb\n   count of external .js files: 10\n   count of external .css files: 4\n   render mode: quirks\n   load time (time to reload, thus assuming most requests cached, average of 3): 3191ms\n Facebook\n   html size: 5.35kb\n   count of external .js files: 27\n   count of external .css files: 25\n   render mode: standards\n   load time (time to reload, thus assuming most requests cached, average of 3): 3207ms<p>  \nI was surprised the load times were so close.  MySpace feels slower but that may be because pages frequently include external images and sound files.<p>I don't mean these comparisions to either trash or promote MySpace or Facebook; instead I think it's instructive to consider which benchmarks translate to the best user experience and what techniques contribute to the better set of numbers.\n",1188400827

47839,comment,47597,47833,0,0,joe,,,"I'm guessing your estimates are correct enough. I doubt the user count for all YC projects exceeds 500,000, and according to <a href=""http://forevergeek.com/articles/debunking_the_myspace_myth_of_100_million_users.php"" rel=""nofollow"">http://forevergeek.com/articles/debunking_the_myspace_myth_o...</a>, MySpace has at least 43 million, which by your math would mean that Facebook has around 14 million users. Having been a frequent MySpace user myself in the not-too-distant past (I'm 22, and I used it from age 18-20), I concur that there have been times in which MySpace ""limped along"". It was not uncommon to get multiple ""application error"" (for lack of a better term -- I don't know/remember what it's called under .NET) during a surfing session, or to encounter a page or profile that just would <i>not</i> load. I've since switched to Facebook, and in comparison, I've never had Facebook barf on me. This, to me, evidences either the dim-wittedness of MySpace's developers, or superiority of Facebook's web solution (<a href=""http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.web.cache.memcached/3224"" rel=""nofollow"">http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.web.cache.memcached/3224</a>) over what MySpace has chosen.<p>Note that I am not saying that PHP > .NET -- obviously on sites of this large scale, as has already been noted in the post's comments, using any technology ""out of the box"" is looking for trouble. What I mean to imply, however, is that perhaps for sites this big, .NET is the wrong thing. And, as the parent comment points, out, IIS certainly isn't helping things, though I don't think Apache would necessarily be a magic bullet. Craigslist, which does many megabytes of data transfer per minute, is considering switching to Lighttpd because Apache too heavyweight.<p>P.S. Sorry about the links -- I couldn't figure out how to link a text string to a URL. Can someone enlighten me?",1188400055

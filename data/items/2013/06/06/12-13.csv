I guess I need to start reading old copies of Wired for inspiration.</i><p>Funny you would say that.  I (among a lot of other people) have certainly noticed how cyclical this industry is; and I also think that it's very easy for a technology to fail, not because there's anything <i>wrong</i> with it, but just because it's ""too early"".<p>And as it happens, I have this bad habit of saving old magazines - so I actually do have a rather large collection of old issues of things like Wired, Red Herring, Business 2.0, Infoworld, ComputerWorld, Information Week, etc. packed away in a closet somewhere.  I actually am thinking about digging a box of those out one day, and spending a few hours just poring over old issues, trawling for ideas and inspiration.<p>In fact, now that you mentioned this and reminded me of thread of thought, I think I might just do that this weekend.",1370523599

I also don't share what's going on in my life with the Internet, unless I think it would interest or help someone else like me. (E.g. I started a blog last fall. It has 3 posts. Every post has over 700 words.

But I don't understand focusing on ""technical interviews"" - that's just illogical to me. A typical 100+ person company's technical interviews happen much less frequently than their non-technical interviews, don't they? Maybe that's not clear - in other words, for your typical company that has technical employees, don't those same companies also need to hire non-technical employees as well? Of course they do. So... if I, the hiring person, use your tool for the technical interviews, what tool do I use for the non-technical interviews? If the answer is, ""Uhhhh..."" or ""A different site"", then that's it - I won't use you. I don't want to have to use multiple sites/tools during hiring; I want to either use one site or no sites.<p>Here's an idea - maybe you open up the board layout/social part for all interviewees, and make the coding/testing aspects an in-site purchase/option? I don't know - it's your business and all - but it seems to me that people will pay a premium for those extra features:<p>* Coding tests<p>* Intelligence testing<p>* Custom Q&A with grading (like @staunch said)",1370523295

5832059,comment,5831491,5831936,6,0,jacques_chester,,,"> <i>I do think that without virtue there can be no value, if these are properly defined.</i><p>This is an unproductive line of argument because either of us can just keep moving the goalposts until we're exhausted.<p>Economic value clearly doesn't follow any ""gut"" virtue. Here's how an early moral theorist put it in a notoriously influential book:<p><pre><code>    I returned, and saw under the sun,\n    that the race is not to the swift,\n    nor the battle to the strong,\n    neither yet bread to the wise,\n    nor yet riches to men of understanding,\n    nor yet favour to men of skill;\n    but time and chance happeneth to them all.\n</code></pre>\nGenerally speaking, attempts to create ranking functions for virtue lead to mismatches with the observed state of the world. You line up the list of virtuous things (curing AIDS, feeding poor people) and the list of valuable things (Ruby on Rails programmers, inanimate chunks of metal) and discover that they just don't line up. At all.<p>But if you try to impose a virtuous order, it all goes kerflooie. Because the whole system of production and allocation relies entirely on value. When you take value you away, it stops working. Partial enforcement leads to partial derangement and in general, creates new evils, requiring still further ranking functions ... it spirals out of control thereafter.<p>We read this:<p><pre><code>    Dear friend, it is not possible for man to avert that\n    which God has decreed shall happen. No one believes \n    warnings, however true. Many of us Persians know our\n    danger, but we are constrained by necessity to do\n    as our leader bids us.\n\n    Verily 'tis the sorest of all human ills, to abound in\n    knowledge and yet have no power over action.\n</code></pre>\nAnd imagine ourselves to be men and women both of knowledge and power. But it was always an illusion.<p>I'm doing a pretty poor job of explaining all this. Hayek's <i>Social or 'Distributive' Justice</i> does a much more convincing, thorough and erudite job. It was published in the second volume of <i>Law, Legislation and Liberty</i>, also in <i>The Essence of Hayek</i>.<p>edit: by the way, your blog about LedgerSMB and PostgreSQL is bloody marvellous.",1370523058

5832054,comment,5831491,5831491,56,0,grey-area,,,"Wonderful writing, I loved the way it circled several times around the central issue - the value of work, and I particularly liked this conclusion - much validation and reward in our society is driven by how much people are willing to pay you for your chosen work, and it's very hard to separate your self-worth and confidence from that. It's hard to reconcile when your values don't meet those of the people around you, as expressed in the salaries for various jobs, which vary wildly without much sign of reason or relation to what society ostensibly values. I think what he's trying to get at is <i>why</i> we overvalue these jobs, which on the face of it are not particularly rewarding either to society or the individuals doing them (apart from monetarily). If you ask people in the street whether we need another Facebook, most would say no, and yet we have hundreds of inchoate and uninspiring replacements being worked on and funded right now, so it's hard to see where the demand is coming from, or why this work is valued so highly, and whether it is in fact a bubble which will burst.<p>Going back to 17C Holland there was probably a huge demand for market traders able to distinguish fine differences in and trade tulip bulbs, until all of a sudden there wasn't - this is the kind of illusory value the writer posits for today's fted startup web workers. I'm not sure I entirely agree, but it shouldn't be dismissed out of hand, because he's not just saying it's unfair, but that it may be unjustified.<p><i>The price of a word is being bid to zero.</i><p>This sentence near the end cuts to the heart of the matter for me - for writers or other producers of original content like photographers there is a cruel and dismal comparison to be drawn between the wages of those paid to frame content and present it to the world, and the wages of those who produce the content. The creative content (writing, photography, art, travel guides etc) is all in demand, but no-one wants to pay for it, perhaps because it's so easy to produce something yourself, and so hard to distinguish the fine differences in quality which separate a remarkable piece of writing or photography from the mediocre.",1370523018

I'm not really even annoyed. I don't know why exactly, but I think it boils down (no pun intended) to two different things.<p>First, I'm under no delusion that the US federal government has my <i>personal</i> best interest in mind with everything that it does. I think that <i>usually</i> the federal government as a whole has the best interest of the <i>entirety</i> of the American people firmly in mind, but it's a big behemoth that is often unaware of the individual.<p>Second, I willingly use technology every day in which people are actively monitoring my actions. Verizon didn't magically start collecting these data at the bequest of the government. Or even if they did (really, they didn't), they'll happily use it in their daily business operations. You're monitored every day by many, many corporations. Many people here have started businesses on that principle alone. Strangely, I trust the federal government <i>more</i> with how they'll limit the scope of their monitoring than I do the private corporations with whom I constantly interact through the use of their technology. Maybe I'm nave.<p>But here's the thing. These are reasons why I'm not outraged by this particular event. The USA PATRIOT Act angers me.

In general a single ""IQ"" figure is merely a statistical index of the subtests. The sub-category indices are much more revealing.<p>3. Can the tests actually accurately sample these components?<p>Also hotly contested. The closest we can come is to compare the test scores statistically to other outcomes, or to other tests. IQ tests which correlate highly with life achievement (factoring out stuff like socioeconomic background, sex, race and mental health) are preferred over those that don't. You can argue that it's circular, and you'd be right.<p>Welcome to psychometrics, where there is no outside world available for objective instrumentation.",1370522059

5831877,comment,5831504,5831504,7,0,JohnLBevan,,,"My version of those points would be:<p>1. Provide a demo option if login's required\nTo avoid asking for people to use features like facebook connect upfront allow them to use a demo version of the app.  This gives them a chance to have a play with the app before committing to it / exposing their identity.  That's particularly useful for HN audience who will pop to your site in order to give you feedback, but also useful to potential users who want to understand more about what your site is than they read on the blurb on the front page.<p>2. Read all feedback and decide what's relevant\nIgnoring feedback on particular subject areas just creates a blind spot.  Read all feedback and use your own judgement to determine if the person has a point or not.  They may be wrong, you may be wrong - but at least if you read the feedback you'll have considered things you may not have previously.<p>3. Focus on the constructive feedback.\nPay more attention to comments which give a problem coupled with a solution - those pointing out issues with no suggestions are more likely to be ranting (~generalisation) whilst those singing your praises aren't giving you anything to improve what you've put out there (though a few such comments are always nice to soothe the ego after reading some of the harsher posts).<p>4. Look for common themes in advice.\nIf lots of people are giving the same advice (e.g. I wouldn't pay $100 for this up front, but I would pay $10 a month) consider what they're suggesting - whereas if one person's ranting that something's too expensive you can probably ignore it.  As with all advice it's about using your judgement rather than ignoring the advice outright because it's about xyz.<p>5. Avoid asking for a credit card upfront\nSame as #1 - provide a demo option which avoids the need for a credit card / perhaps give a first month free option to allow use of the product without card details.  If someone from HN goes to check out your app and give you feedback, you shouldn't charge them for their advice.  If a potential user can't play with the app before paying for it (or trusting you with their details having seen no more than the front page) they'll also be less likely to join.",1370520854

5831831,comment,5830993,5830993,1,0,einhverfr,,,"I think that one of the huge problems is that there has never really been to my knowledge a systematic look at the epistemological limits of IQ tests.  However just looking at it quickly I can spot two <i>huge</i> epistemological issues which make IQ tests more or less worthless for objective study, and more or less cultural artifacts.<p>The first, which I have mentioned in a few posts is that at some point you end up comparing apples and melons (the pun for those of you who didn't get it is that 'melon' is Classical Greek for 'apple').  These things may be things where we can make connections but any cultural weight we place on one relative to another is just that, a cultural weight. For this reason intelligence, even if IQ tests measure what we expect them to (and I am not sure of that, see below), the results cannot be objectively reduced to a single number.  You would really need to look at intelligence as a multi-dimensional vector with the understanding that we might be missing some aspects anyway.<p>The second problem though that I can spot immediately is that some skills they want to test cannot be objectively tested.  The big one that comes to mind is pattern recognition.  If you haven't read it, I think Heisenberg's ""Physics and Philosophy"" is a must read here because his discussions of the relationship between data and theory are directly relevant to this.<p>When we recognize a pattern what we actually do is we project assumptions onto the data and find a pattern which fits both the assumptions and the data.  This is the process Heisenberg articulates regarding the formation of scientific theories.  The pattern recognized is <i>both</i> a product of our assumptions and the data and therefore patterns are at once recognized and created.  Of course Heisenberg was talking about his forte (theoretical physics) but the same applies here because this is a human process.<p>The simple fact is that several competing sets of patterns can be made to fit the data.  For example, take the following set of items:<p>Hammer, log, ax, saw<p>Which one doesn't belong?<p>One pattern might be to that ""hammer, ax, and saw"" are the pattern and log is the outsider.  Another pattern might be ""I can build something with the hammer, the log, and the saw, much more than I can with any other combination so the ax doesn't belong.""  Therefore such a question has at least two legitimate answers because two different set of assumptions can be projected onto the set with very different results.  Now typically we are going to say one of those (the first, ""log"" doesn't fit) is correct and the other is wrong, but that doesn't actually test the ability to recognize patterns so much as it tests the ability of the test taker to figure out the answer that the author wants.  This makes pattern recognition <i>fundamentally</i> culturally determined and if you can't get away from this you can't quantify this through standardized testing.<p>But let's take this further.  We typically refer to a genius as someone who finds useful patterns that nobody else does.  The IQ test then, if we accept Heisenberg's epistemology, should actively select <i>against</i> genius in these areas-- either the patterns must be trivial, or they must be sufficiently complex you cannot be sure whether a ""wrong"" answer in fact does not have a recognizable pattern to it.  So you end up having to throw out a good chunk of the test here as being very closely culturally determined (and basically an exercise of mind-reading the author).<p>The first problem could be solved by expressing intelligence as a multidimensional vector, but the second is much more problematic.  How do you know that the test answer is right and the test taker is wrong when it comes to two competing patterns seen in the question?",1370520125

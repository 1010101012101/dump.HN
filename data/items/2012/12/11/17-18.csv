4905713,comment,4905446,4905446,3,0,ramanujan,,,"Legal startups are an important new trend, with Legalzoom, Rocketlawyer, Judicata, and quite a few others that have recently been announced:<p><a href=""http://venturebeat.com/2012/03/20/legal-startups"" rel=""nofollow"">http://venturebeat.com/2012/03/20/legal-startups</a><p><a href=""http://startupstats.com/legal-startup-2012-03"" rel=""nofollow"">http://startupstats.com/legal-startup-2012-03</a><p>One important question is ""why now"", which is partially addressed in the post:<p><pre><code>  The latter is clearly ideal. So why hasnt it happened yet? \n  Why hasnt software eaten the law? Our thesis is that its \n  actually quite hard. Lots of people have tried. Some are \n  still trying. But most are hacking at the branches. \n\n  Incremental change is not without value. But software cant \n  actually improve legal decision making unless we aim \n  higher. Harder, but more promising, is to strike at the \n  root of the problem. The law is information. The future of \n  legal technology involves organizing and understanding that \n  information. ... The fusion of legal domain expertise and \n  engineering talent is key\n</code></pre>\nSo, this rationale is a good one for Judicata (their team is clearly very talented), but it's worth thinking about what's going in terms of prerequisites from a broader perspective.<p>Sometimes there are ideas that were just before their time; 1999's webvan.com didn't work, but today delivery.walmart.com or Amazon Fresh is available. Webvan failed because it was nontrivial to set up a nationwide infrastructure to deliver low-margin perishable goods. Amazon and Walmart built that incrementally; Amazon starting with higher-margin non-perishable books and Walmart with physical stores. And even Amazon Fresh is not yet nationwide.<p>Sometimes there are clear technological reasons why newer iterations took off. Six Degrees was one of the first social networks circa ~1999, but digital cameras weren't that popular and it was hard to get photos of faces online. Just a few years later, Friendster and then Facebook didn't have that problem.<p>And sometimes there are ideas that just require experience to build. A lot of the early cloud services were premature because people just didn't have experience operating large websites at scale. It's a lot easier to factor AWS out of experience operating Amazon, or App Engine out of experience operating Google, than to do it from scratch in 1998.<p>Infrastructure might be one of the most compelling arguments for ""why now"". Today, unlike ten years ago, every single lawyer is using computers and mobile devices regularly. Massive numbers of legal documents and patents have been digitally indexed in Google Scholar. And many judges and law professors have been blogging for sometime.<p>But perhaps the evolution of the legal market is the most important. Lots and lots of young lawyers are out of work or underemployed while paying off huge student loans. There is a newfound cynicism about law school and that means the young have started to think about doing things differently. Even those from elite schools who have no problem getting jobs can feel this in the zeitgeist. And, critically, these discontented young would also be the first adopters of any new technology.<p>So perhaps that's the answer. Why now for the boom in legal startups? Not because of a single new technology per se, but because (a) one can assume computer/internet/mobile infrastructure to be utterly ubiquitous [even in law offices] and (b) the market is ready because young lawyers are restless.",1355248628

So we settle on curriculums that target the ""bottom average.""

There is some irritation where it takes a few minutes to put on all the gear (pants, boots, jacket, gloves, ear plugs, neck gator if cold, and helmet) over work clothes, take them off at work, repeat on the way home.  Cargo can be an irritation, needing tying down.  A bag of groceries or case of cans is okay but not much more.  I need a better way to carry a laptop.

But that is an if that many here - including myself - are not inclined to grant.  And if you DON'T grant it, then this is very much not fine.<p>You acknowledge this, sort of, but only when using the loaded language <i>intellectual inventions</i> to describe patents.  This deliberately ignores the fact that a major complaint about the current patent system is the proliferation of patents which claim ""invention"" status to things that should not be called inventions.<p>You then go on to call the question of whether patents should be property a totally separate issue.  I agree that it is totally separate from the line of argument that you want to pursue.  But, given the opinions of most people on this site, it is actually the central issue.  Your sophistry about property laws is actually the side issue that should be ignored in favor of what is really important.<p>The key question is this, is the rapid proliferation of lawsuits from non-practicing entities a problem?  In fact evidence suggests that the companies being sued are generally ones that are creating real innovation, economic development, and jobs.  The companies doing most of the suing are creating a tax on innovation.  If you look at who is paying the costs, and who is capturing the profits, by and large the patent system is failing to incentivize actual innovation, and is rewarding useless legal activity.<p>When you look at it in this light, the activity of the non-practicing entities is absolutely the greatest source of the gap between what the patent system theoretically should be doing, and what it actually is doing.  Therefore the rapid proliferation of lawsuits by non-practicing entities is direct evidence that our bad patent system is rapidly becoming worse.<p>Now, like a good lawyer, I expect you to take apart and criticize everything that I've said.  After all you're paid to come to the conclusion you've decided in advance to, rather than to find the correct answer.  Truth, for a lawyer in an argument, is merely one source of rhetorical ammunition.  I admit it.  I am not a lawyer.  In a war of words, you'll win.<p>But I honestly believe that the ideas that I am putting forth are correct.  And the ideas that you are putting forth are dangerous ideas that currently cost our economy tens of billions per year.  Furthermore those costs are rapidly mounting.  For decades now, Silicon Valley has been the world capital for tech startups.  Some day, hopefully a long time from now, this will end and Silicon Valley will pass into history.

You're right that even in such a world, it's not practical to just troll through existing patents. So you proceed blithly ahead until someone realizes: ""hey, this guy is making a lot of money and I think he should've gotten a license from us."" They send an e-mail saying: ""hey, you owe us some money."" The recipient says: ""oh, I think you're right."" They do negotiate a license, and go on their merry way. This isn't ""waiting under a bridge until the 'victim' is most vulnerable."" Rather, it's like ""lazy loading"" of libraries. You avoid doing the work of determining what patents need to be licensed until the last possible moment. But the retroactive effect of any demand/suit should be similar to just having licensed that patent in the first place. Moreover, there is absolutely nothing illegitimate about only going after people with deep pockets in pursuing patent infringements. I don't sue the neighbor's kid for cutting through my property, but I'd probably sue anyone who drove a truck through it!<p>Using terms of ""victim"" and ""vulnerable"" are really inapropos here. A lawsuit is not an ""attack."" It's a ""hey, I think you owe me some money."" These are businesses all trying to make profit off inventions. If the patents in question are valid and legitimate (and I think a lot of them might not be, to be fair!) then there is no illegitimacy in a non-practicing entity suing to enforce their patent rights, because ultimately those rights derive from the original inventor. The NPE might not ""create anything of value,"" but the inventor did, and the NPE bought out the inventor.<p>Now, to be fair, lawsuits are in inefficient way to transact in property rights, even if they are a legitimate way. Most people who believe in the patent regime think we need to develop things like patent markets to make it easier for companies to find and license patents without resorting to lawsuits.",1355247469

If I was in the business of using copyrighted works in what is legally defined as satire, I'd be playing it very carefully.

Title 35 of the United States Code states that ""the court shall award the claimant damages adequate to compensate for the infringement, but in no event less than a reasonable royalty for the use made of the invention by the infringer"".

My findings so far:<p><pre><code>  The good:\n  * Done in python. Easy to read.\n  * Easy to extend or modify (done via python modules)\n  * Supposedly can be extended/configured to a certain extent without code (field additions, etc)\n  * Has a long list of modules available, and core modules which support my needed (accounting, finance, warehouse/supply chain, HR/Payroll)\n  * Requires PostgreSQL...my database of choice.\n  * Seems pretty stable...I haven't hit many bugs yet.\n  * Fully open source under the AGPL...you get the entire product, unlike others such as OpenBravo and XTuple where you have to pay to get certain features. The flip side of this is that because it's AGPL, you have to release the source any modifications or modules you make unless you pay OpenERP for a subscription (and consequently, a different license)\n \n  The bad:\n  * The documentation is badly out of date. There are two versions...web-based and PDF. The web-based ones are more updated, but still out of date. Trying to learn as complex a system as an ERP with broken documentation is a very frustrating exercise. This is probably to biggest headache for me and it has significantly slowed our evaluation. It'd be at least a little better if I could pay for improved docs, but this is all they have...even paying customers are provided out-dated documentation.\n  * Not many success stories in the US. I get the impression that it's more popular in Europe (OpenERP is out of Belgium).\n  * Company is a bit unresponsive. I've contacted them and had very little successful communication with them, even though they have a US rep. If you read online, others seem to have had similar problems.\n</code></pre>\nWe're still going to make a go of it, because our current system is legacy and leaves a lot to be desired. However, I think they could have a lot more success by hiring tech writers and making sure the documentation stays up to date.",1355245748

4905399,comment,4902960,4902960,3,0,robomartin,,,"In most of these discussions there's a question about the fairness of Apple's 30% cut. Are they charging too much?<p>Most might just look at the cost of a credit card transaction (~3%) and think that 30% is just crazy.  That, of course, is the wrong way to look at it.  The act of selling a product costs far more than the credit card processing fees.  This is particularly true for physical products that you have to store and ship.<p>The best comparison I can make is to take a look at having Amazon sell your product.  Here are the fees:<p><a href=""http://www.amazonservices.com/selling/pricing.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazonservices.com/selling/pricing.htm</a><p>In very rough strokes, fees range from about 5% to 50% of the transaction total, depending on the cost and nature of the items sold.<p>Clearly Apple could charge a lot less for higher valued items. Right?  The flat 30% cut starts to become excessive at some point.  If I understand Amazon's pricing for selling your software product the two services compare as follows (assuming no shipping, only downloads):<p><pre><code>     price   Apple  Amazon    % of Amazon take\n      1.00    0.30    2.49    249%\n      5.00    1.50    3.09     62%\n     10.00    3.00    3.84     38%\n     15.00    4.50    4.59     31%\n     20.00    6.00    5.34     27%\n     25.00    7.50    6.09     24%\n     30.00    9.00    6.84     23%\n     35.00   10.50    7.59     22%\n     40.00   12.00    8.34     21%\n     45.00   13.50    9.09     20%\n     50.00   15.00    9.84     20%\n     75.00   22.50   13.59     18%\n    100.00   30.00   17.34     17%\n</code></pre>\nIn this possibly contrived comparison it'd cost about the same to sell your product through Amazon up to about $15 to $20.  After that Amazon charges you less.  For low price items Apple is ridiculously cheap.<p>Can you do better if you handle your own transactions, fulfillment, hosting, customer service, fraud/loss prevention, etc.  Possibly.  It certainly doesn't get down to the raw ~3% you pay for CC transactions.  My guess is that a highly optimized operation might be able to achieve 5% to 25% depending on the nature of the product and sale price.  Clearly selling items below about $10 requires a highly optimized operation with huge volume or your are going to loose your shirt --and more-- no matter how you approach it (keep that in mind when selling something for a buck on eBay).",1355245537

We've been going since 2007 and have had a ""meh"" response to some of our SaaS offerings, while a couple have been partially successful but would in no way support the company on their own.<p>The problem: my co-founder is leaving, and continuing the company doing the generally uninspiring paid work which has become the norm does not appeal. Paid work was intended to provide capital for building products of our own - not as an end in itself. And, over the last couple of years, enthusiasm wained for building new services, mundanity crept in, and the company increasingly relied on client work until no aspiration for our own work remained. We're loved by the clients we work for and it's been worth it financially, but I don't find the majority of work inspiring, challenging or worthwhile (sounds bad but I'd love to work on stuff provided real value).<p>So, by the end of the year, I'm going to be left in control of the company with no clear idea what the next step should/could be.<p>Has anyone turned their directionless company around when a founder has left? Did you close the company and make a new start?

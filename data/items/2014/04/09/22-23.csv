Automagic implicit hopping around to different locations in your code-base is the fatal flaw with so many overly clever programming tricks.<p>Go is made purposely dangerous, to force people to explicitly do the right thing. Java&#x27;s enforcement of exceptions looks like the right thing on the surface, but it instead encourages people to handle exceptions in dangerous ways when they&#x27;re in a hurry.",1397084339

Why allow more than about 128 bits of data for distinguishing responses? I guess you might argue a client might want to disguise the nature of these heartbeat packets from an eavesdropper, so they need to be variable in size - that&#x27;s reasonable, but if it&#x27;s a requirement, then surely you&#x27;d want to comment on the security risk of using a &quot;simple sequence of numbers&quot; rather than &quot;something more elaborate&quot;. 64K of data, though? That seems like a lot of leeway to give an implementation - considerably more than enough to disambiguate heartbeat packets; implementations are going to keep 64K of data around and compare it byte for byte to check whether the echo they got back matches the payload they transmitted earlier?<p>I really don&#x27;t mean to ascribe malice here; I tend to assume this is just a bug, and that the payload for heartbeat packets gets to be up to 64K because once you&#x27;ve decided to make something a variable length buffer, you&#x27;re probably choosing between having a one byte or a two byte field for length, and 256 bytes seems like it might be too small so you figure &#x27;why not make the length field two bytes?&#x27; and then... oops; someone makes a buffer overrun and suddenly we&#x27;re faced with 64K at a time of data being ripped out of any old server&#x27;s heap.",1397082490

7562836,comment,7562207,7562207,9,0,candybar,,,"The problem I&#x27;m seeing with this whole unification of design across a whole system including hardware and software is that designing a proper UI for software is orders of magnitude more complex than designing UI for hardware.  Not only is software far more complex than typical end-user hardware from a functionality standpoint, it&#x27;s far more malleable, indefinitely extensible and has to work with third-party components over which it has little control.  Also, because it takes far longer to learn how to use software, simply being good isn&#x27;t enough - it has to work within the constraints of people&#x27;s expectations, far more than a piece of hardware has to.<p>Now, there&#x27;s certainly commonality between the two but if you were to exaggerate the difference, hardware UI design is like writing a sonnet.  The medium is constraining but the compromises you have to make with other people are minimal - if you write a great sonnet, the chance is that people will like it.  Software UI design is more like writing a constitution - it&#x27;s about compromises.  You have to weigh the needs of present users against those of future users, usability of old applications against new applications, properly balance the opinions and ideas of a whole bunch of people involved in design and implementation of various features, not to mention third-party developers.  No matter what you do, there will be a huge number of inconsistencies, a lot of people will hate it and many others will worship and faithfully copy your mistakes, in a way that makes correcting your mistakes difficult.<p>Edit: Btw, when I say hardware UI, I actually mean the hardware as seen and directly manipulated by the user without software as the intermediary.  If by hardware, we mean software interface to the hardware, the above points also apply to hardware, though hardware is still considerably simpler and the work is done almost entirely at the component level that has nothing to do with Jony Ive.  At the whole system level, which is where Jony Ive comes in, hardware UI design is inherently simple.  Simple doesn&#x27;t mean easy - it just means you&#x27;re judged by different standards.",1397081544

This is a MAJOR disaster.<p>It is unfeasible to blacklist such a large amount of certificates - as every device requires a list of all blacklisted certificates. This means all of the major CA&#x27;s are going to have to black list their intermediate certificate authorities, and start issuing all new certificates under new CA&#x27;s. This means even people who weren&#x27;t effected will probably have to have their certificates blacklisted.<p>In short EVERY existing CA used on the internet may have to be black listed, and every single SSL certificate re-issued.<p>IMO SSL/TLS is now completely broken.

He was gracious enough to agree, and we recorded before one of his regularly scheduled interviews. I was nervous as hell! I mean, you never really see an interviewer being interviewed themselves. What questions do you ask?<p>I asked a lot of basic questions (history, inspiration, setbacks, etc.) and a few that made Andrew sit back and go, &quot;hmmm, that&#x27;s a good question...&quot; but the real knowledge I gained came with Andrew&#x27;s feedback immediately after. The magnitude of which has slowly been realized since: feeling uncomfortable is good.<p>Doing something new almost always feels uncomfortable to some degree... and an entrepreneur is almost always doing something new. Rather than try to mitigate that uneasy feeling, you can take it and embrace it. That dissonance between your gut and your brain is the origin of curiosity; where knowledge is needed to fill the holes. If something feels uncomfortable, it&#x27;s because you haven&#x27;t done it enough. You don&#x27;t fully understand it. While it helps to have a mentor who can say whether an uneasy feeling is normal and how to get over it, the important thing is to just get your hands dirty. Just do that new task, or ask that difficult question.<p>It&#x27;s been rewarding to watch Mixergy develop over the years—to see Andrew dirty his hands and dive into that space which makes every interviewee feel uncomfortable and vulnerable (as well as himself).<p>Thanks for everything, Andrew!",1397080875

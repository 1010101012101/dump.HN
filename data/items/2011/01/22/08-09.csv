They are in the source tree and that is essentially part of the build process. What's more, the source tree is distributed to all Android manufacturers. Google are shipping the source code.<p>I'm sure Oracle don't see it that way.<p>What we should be talking about is how they got into the git tree in the first place.",1295686718

Teredo might save you in a transition period, but it depends on IPv4 so wont work with your experiment here.<p>2. You use a very narrow set of services. Currently I'm able to use IPv6 for usenet, google-services, facebook (although buggy with links back to the IPv4 site all over the place), Ubuntu-updates, Freenode and EFNet irc and -one- news-site.<p>3. And for google's services' to work you need their IPv6-addresses. Chances are you don't have them, because they don't expose them over DNS in public by default.<p>If this covers all you use the internet for, you should be golden.",1295685902

The obvious next step was trying to make it smart enough that it recognizes similar lines and generated the patterns itself, but avoiding making it over generalized/omnicomprehensive.\nI still cannot find a good solution :(",1295685571

2130179,comment,2129755,2129755,0,0,Luyt,,,"There seems to be a obsession with version numbers: People perceive these as if they must always have the latest/greatest. For example, when MSSQL 2008 came out, the database admin at a company I work for upgraded the MSSQL 2005 database to it, breaking a few applications due to incompatibilities. Version 2008 offered no features we were planning to use, so from an operational standpoint it was completely unnecessary. But it was motivated just because of the higher version number.<p>The same with Python2 and Python3.  Python3 just exists out there so library developers can port their code over to it.  It isn't meant to be used in production yet, and people learning Python are advised to learn Python2, not 3.  Yet time and time again people choose version 3 to begin with 'because it must be better since it's 3 and everyone knows 3 is better than 2' (the most often heard reason on the #python IRC channel), thereby making it more difficult for themselves than necessary.",1295684638

2130171,comment,2130003,2130108,0,0,chegra,,,"I don't think awards should be the end goal, but they do serve a purpose.  For instance, most people on here probably wouldn't have heard about Liu Xiaobo, well atleast before he won the Nobel Peace Prize.  Having the backing of prestigious award such as Nobel Prize will only bolster his cause; he's in prison. Increase financial and political support is not silly at all.<p>For scientist, this might mean that they wouldn't have to fight as hard to get funding from people who don't understand their research. The people who don't understand research understand awards, so it can be used as a proxy to make judgement.",1295683912

ChromeOS is well on it's way (it won't compete with the MSFT or AAPL but it has it's niche). Gmail is the best free mail service available (and it definitely was revolutionary, think back to when it was just released). Google AdSense changed the way people monetize on the internet. Google Search was the biggest revolution in the history of the internet. Google Maps/Earth was also a huge revolution and is used by so many different services and software on the internet and on cellphones. Google Documents? Google Voice? Please, Google owns the internet.<p>Sure, Google may not have any hardware revolutions such as Apple, but when it comes to the internet, Google creates and makes possible the most innovative ideas.",1295683733

I used to be able to tell people to go and download ""Open Office"" and they remember.<p>Phonetically, if you use ""Librii Office"" - they dont. ""Libr Office"" they dont. I am not sure why - but I have spoken to dozens in India (accountants, lawyers, etc.) and the name just doesnt have recall. Libre also is not a Commonwealth English word.<p>I'm sure everyone came up with that name with a noble intent - but it simply isnt working in India which is extremely Anglicized as compared to most other Asian countries. That name really needs to change.<p>On a curious note - in the U.S. have you spoken to a non-geek, say your pizza delivery dude, and have brand recall of ""Libreoffice"" ?",1295683664

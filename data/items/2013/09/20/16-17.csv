It&#x27;s like successive approximations, the errors from making a mistake go down as you move along if you don&#x27;t need a precise result.<p>For instance, what&#x27;s pi * e? Good luck calculating that from the LSB... ;-)<p>But with MSB, you know it&#x27;s about 9 because pi is on the low end of 3-4 and e is on the high end of 2-3.<p>So you can do<p>3.14 * 2.72\n3<i>3 + .14</i>3 - .28*3 - something small\n(idea here is that the cross term is small, three sig figs)\n9 + .4ish - .9ish\n8.5ish<p>Actual result is 8.5397.<p>So you can get a few sig figs by saying &quot;eh, these digits are too small to matter&quot; and ignoring cross multiplication of the LSBs for problems that aren&#x27;t for the purpose of arithmetic.<p>I use this often in engineering estimation on the fly, because so many constants are only known to 1 sig-fig anyway that it&#x27;s really hardly worth worrying about more accuracy.

That&#x27;s why the predictive validity of work-sample tests is only about .50 across a wide range of industries. But the key point is that EVERY other hiring procedure, except for general cognitive ability tests, has lower validity, so a company is throwing away a lot of opportunity to hire good workers if it doesn&#x27;t use a combination of work-sample testing and cognitive ability testing for all of its hiring. Your sound analysis can be turned around to using interviews as a hiring procedure--which is much more commonplace than using work-sample testing as a hiring procedure--to make the correct point that an applicant who looks good in an interview may not be a &quot;team player&quot; once hired. Any hiring procedure is a sample of applicant behavior, not fully representative of how the worker will behave on the job after being hired. But work-sample tests get much closer to what the worker will do on the job long-term than any other procedure besides general cognitive ability tests. Because work-sample tests and cognitive ability tests each have incremental validity when added to the other, it&#x27;s best to use both in combination to get a hiring procedure with somewhat more than .50 validity in finding good workers.",1379695509

It&#x27;s about wanting to win but realizing that winning isn&#x27;t the goal at all.  You know, when it&#x27;s match point, and there&#x27;s a ball that was probably out, but you didn&#x27;t see it clearly, and you know the rules - if you can&#x27;t make the call, the point and match goes to your opponent.  Go shake hands with your head held high.  It doesn&#x27;t matter if you&#x27;re a crappy tennis player or a great one.  You played hard, and you played fairly.<p>Unfortunately, what I just described isn&#x27;t really sports in America.  There&#x27;s no way to tell this next anecdote without admitting that I watched &quot;The Biggest Loser&quot;, so let&#x27;s just get that out of the way now.  Ok. so.  There was this section where an NFL player shows up to talk about how the NFL takes fitness and obesity seriously, and so, they&#x27;re announcing a &quot;fifteen <i>thousand</i> dollar&quot; (well, I don&#x27;t remember the exact amount) donation to help fight obesity.<p>So, a league that makes billions off people who rarely exercise and sit on their sofa watching people play an expensive sport that probably badly harms people when played as intended and is largely inaccessible in the form played professionally (tag or flag football is a different thing, and is kind of fun in my opinion), raking in millions (billions?) in ad dollars by subjecting the non-exercising viewers to barrage of advertisements for empty calorie foods supplemented with a chemical scientists use to induce obesity in lab rats, is now going to donate 0.000001% of the budget to purchase some unused exercise equipment to help fight obesity.  Ok, I&#x27;m not sure it goes exactly like that, but I&#x27;m pretty sure it doesn&#x27;t go exactly unlike that.<p>And here&#x27;s one more problem - I really like college football.

I&#x27;ve done ~60 skydives and was lucky enough to be invited to tag along with a friend who had purchased a 30 min block at the skydive AZ tunnel. We&#x27;d been jumping together that day and I&#x27;d been struggling to fall as slow as other people in our group. They threw me into the tunnel and in the space of the 1st two minutes had taught me how to adjust my fall rate WAY better than I had been doing. Getting instant feedback on your body position dramatically shortens the learning curve. Compared to trying to get coaching during a normal skydive, even when debriefing with video; where you have to repack, manifest for another jump, take the ride to height and then try to implement the adjustments you&#x27;d been instructed about some 45 minutes prior.<p>So yeah, &quot;burning&quot; ~$150 to get 5 mins of tunnel time seems expensive. I hadn&#x27;t spent any of my own cash on it exactly because I thought it was too rich and I&#x27;d rather actually skydive. But now I see that investing that $150 to ensure I didn&#x27;t waste another 4 or 5 jumps (~$200 including gear hire) learning to fall slower saved me a load of frustration and a bit of money.<p>That&#x27;s why I think the tunnel is an amazing learning tool. When you&#x27;re in the tunnel there is no distractions, you&#x27;re in there to learn and improve. When I skydive I&#x27;m still trying to learn and improve, but mostly I&#x27;m doing it for pure enjoyment of the experience of flying bigger formations.",1379695057

I was living fine. If you can&#x27;t manage your money, that&#x27;s your problem. Sure I couldn&#x27;t buy the latest boots or iphone, but who gives a fuck? Buy a book, it&#x27;ll cost ya $5 and last you for far longer than that stupid phone you slaved a month away working for.<p>If you manage your money well you will save little, by little, and you will invest that capital into bettering yourself and moving up. I saved money for online courses.<p>If you don&#x27;t get out into the real world and hustle, you will get nowhere. Reading a lot of HN I can&#x27;t help but feel that most HN&#x27;ers want their computer to be their absolute portal into real life.<p>It isn&#x27;t. It&#x27;s like, 1% of real life. Real life is face to face. Real life is personal relationships with people, it&#x27;s respect, it&#x27;s keeping your word, it&#x27;s keeping calm, it&#x27;s keeping your mind in a good state, it&#x27;s building relationships that benefit both people, it&#x27;s not being a bitch. It&#x27;s not about you. It&#x27;s about them, and when you enforce that attitude, that attitude spreads and starts to work in your favour. You start meeting people, and keeping those people. Nothing has ever changed anything for me than buckling down, making myself presentable, and being confident. It&#x27;s hard, but it needs to get done.<p>I invested PURELY IN KNOWLEDGE. I then sold that knowledge. That&#x27;s how you make money. You trade knowledge, for cash. I buy gourmet food now, because I can&#x27;t cook it myself. I pay for university, because it&#x27;s far easier to learn something from a professional in 4 years than ripping through books my entire life. This entire world is built upon this foundation.<p>I fucking hate seeing people argue this shit like it&#x27;s black and white. The problem isn&#x27;t the money, it&#x27;s the people and the decisions they make. If you play your cards right you&#x27;ll get to where you want to be.<p>I could have acted like a cynical poor ass like the world was working against me, and it was, but you need to rise above the victim mentality.",1379694844

You can provide insight without having to crunch a zillion data points.<p>This is an example of an industry vertical analytics solution. Our hypothesis is that analytics products will be created to support all kinds of use cases like this (insurance analytics, manufacturing analytics, distribution analytics, etc). We want Keen IO to be the platform on which people build those solutions.<p>The way we can help you is to first make it easy for you to reliably collect data from all your dentists (with client libraries). Then we expose all that data, and of our analytics capabilities (e.g. queries), by REST API. You can log into Keen IO and create a line chart, then copy and paste the javascript right into your site. Now you can build a completely white-labeled website for your dentists, while we take care of storing and querying your event data. Our scoped API keys will allow you to secure the data so a given dentist can only see data for her offices. You can also create an internal dashboard for your team so you&#x27;ll able to do analysis across all the dentists. Hopefully you&#x27;ll discover industry trends and benchmarks that you can use in marketing reports or to resell to the dental industry (assuming your dentists allow this!).

You send the first order, you receive the response in a small amount of time, and then you send the order for the hedge.  Alternately, you send the order and a hedge of a guessed size concurrently, wait for the order&#x27;s response, and then adjust the hedge.  Five minute or half-hour round-trip times would not be acceptable regardless, so a proposal that seeks to be taken seriously should address this issue.<p>Some thoughts on addressing the issue: implementing this sort of thing entirely on the server side would be a colossal engineering effort, and probably involve adding new &quot;fill conditioned on state of other order (on a different exchange in a different country)&quot; order types.  A naive implementation of these conditional orders as described permits causal cycles where taking the shares causes one to take the shares, and not taking them causes one not to, and then one wonders whether the exchanges (the many worldwide exchanges that are collaborating on this algorithm) should have the order take the shares or not!  A similar causal cycle may occur in which taking some shares causes one not to take the shares and vice versa.  Regardless of what resolution is chosen for the &quot;paradoxical&quot; case, it will undoubtedly be a significant undertaking for both mathematicians and bakers to discern the correct combination of order types to maximize EV or to minimize risk, and to choose between maximizing EV and minimizing risk each time a position involving more than one instrument is traded.<p>Alternately, we could allow each exchange to make its own rules.

I&#x27;ve yet to encounter a technical challenge that would tell me much more about a candidate than basically how fluent they are with their tools, how well they know syntax and some general design principles, and what, for instance, their TDD (or lack of) workflow is like. Probably some insight into line-level analytic and algorithmic ability.<p>All of that is helpful, but -- Trust Me Here!! -- can also be very deceiving. The same coders that can knock those challenges out of the park can also be highly-proficient <i>Debt Machines</i>, all the more destructive because of their special genius for cranking out architecturally suspect code at a breathtaking rate.<p>To get into a real &#x27;work-context&#x27; flow of a large app requires weeks, sometimes months, and only <i>then</i> can you get full perspective on how a given coder is going to contribute to your team on an ongoing basis.

However, thanks to poor record-keeping, Mr. Decary  a retired judge who has been the agencys independent watchdog since 2010  said he cant be sure.[1]<p>CSEC is forbidden from intentionally collecting or analyzing information from Canadian citizens in Canada or abroad. However, the National Defence Act allows the defence minister to give CSEC written ministerial authorization to intercept private communications unintentionally while collecting foreign-signals intelligence.[1]<p>Doesn&#x27;t this contradict with the Canadian Privacy Act?<p>Yet, while Mr. Binney compliments the surveillance acumen of Communications Security Establishment Canada, he also urged the Canadian public to scrutinize CSEC  especially given its long-standing close ties to the NSA. They have integrated reps, he said, referring to how the agencies swap personnel. He pointed out that they also share technology, such as a very powerful, recently revealed Internet-surveillance tool, code-named XKeyscore. CSEC does not direct its activities at Canadians and is prohibited by law from doing so, its chief, John Forster, said in a rare public statement. Yet, records recently obtained by The Globe show that CSEC has been developing its own secretive programs to incidentally monitor at least some Canadian telecommunications traffic.[2]<p>Some of Mr. Snowdens leaks speak to the NSAs close relationship with CSEC  suggesting, for example, that the two agencies teamed up to spy on foreign diplomats at a 2009 G20 meeting in London, and may have also been in cahoots to install a back door to spy on encrypted messages on the Internet in 2006.[2]<p>At the time, Canadas Communications Security Establishment ran the standards process for the international organization, but classified documents describe how ultimately the N.S.A. seized control. After some behind-the-scenes finessing with the head of the Canadian national delegation and with C.S.E., the stage was set for N.S.A. to submit a rewrite of the draft, the memo notes. Eventually, N.S.A. became the sole editor.[3]<p>So CSEC was being coerced by NSA and completely gave up control. Although I can respect the apparent &quot;restraint&quot; Canadian government has, but clearly system can be abused and will stay way under the radar compared to NSA and GHCQ. \n[1]<a href=""http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/politics/watchdog-says-spy-agency-might-have-illegally-eavesdropped-on-canadians/article13913875/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/politics/watchdog-says-s...</a>\n[2]<a href=""http://www.theglobeandmail.com/technology/beware-of-data-spying-former-nsa-official-warns-canadians/article14430225/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.theglobeandmail.com/technology/beware-of-data-spy...</a>\n[3]<a href=""http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/09/10/government-announce"" rel=""nofollow"">http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/09/10/government-announce</a>",1379693668

He pointed out that they also share technology, such as a very powerful, recently revealed Internet-surveillance tool, code-named XKeyscore.\nCSEC does not direct its activities at Canadians and is prohibited by law from doing so, its chief, John Forster, said in a rare public statement.\nYet, records recently obtained by The Globe show that CSEC has been developing its own secretive programs to incidentally monitor at least some Canadian telecommunications traffic.[2]\nSome of Mr. Snowdens leaks speak to the NSAs close relationship with CSEC  suggesting, for example, that the two agencies teamed up to spy on foreign diplomats at a 2009 G20 meeting in London, and may have also been in cahoots to install a back door to spy on encrypted messages on the Internet in 2006.[2]\nAt the time, Canadas Communications Security Establishment ran the standards process for the international organization, but classified documents describe how ultimately the N.S.A. seized control. After some behind-the-scenes finessing with the head of the Canadian national delegation and with C.S.E., the stage was set for N.S.A. to submit a rewrite of the draft, the memo notes. Eventually, N.S.A. became the sole editor.[3]\nSo CSEC was being coerced by NSA and completely gave up control.\nAlthough I can respect the apparent &quot;restraint&quot; Canadian government has, but clearly system can be abused and will stay way under the radar compared to NSA and GHCQ.\n[1]<a href=""http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/politics/watchdog-says-s.."" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/politics/watchdog-says-s...</a>.\n[2]<a href=""http://www.theglobeandmail.com/technology/beware-of-data-"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.theglobeandmail.com/technology/beware-of-data-</a>\n[3]<a href=""http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/09/10/government-announce"" rel=""nofollow"">http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/09/10/government-announce</a>",1379693392

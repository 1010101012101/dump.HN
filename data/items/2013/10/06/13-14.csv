Some will benefit and some will be harmed, but the overall outcome is expected to be positive for all sides. Achieving that balance will require concessions from both sides.

So apparently there&#x27;s something about this movie that provokes poking holes in its portrayal of physics -- I immediately got very annoyed while watching the trailer.<p>First, they don&#x27;t have their visors (those Sun protective, gold plated ones).  I&#x27;m not sure, but I guess that&#x27;s a big no-no on EVAs, having the Sun enter your field of vision so close to it (in Earth&#x27;s orbit) would probably do some eye damage.  Again, I&#x27;m not sure the visor is always mandatory but I don&#x27;t remember seeing any photos of actual EVAs without it being down.<p>Second, Sandra Bullock rotating while attached to Canadarm...  My impression was that the g force would be too high for her to stay conscious, or able to communicate.  But it turns out intuition was wrong on that one: back of envelope calculation gives ~3 g (assuming 15 m length for the Canadarm [assuming it is the Shuttle Canadarm], but it was slightly retracted so it would be less, and a period of ~4 s) while still attached to the Shuttle, and ~1.5 g when the arm broke off (~3 m radius, 2-3 s period).  So, that&#x27;s OK. :)<p>Third, the abuse those suits were getting!  That&#x27;s just crazy.  At that point I got so annoyed that I didn&#x27;t bother to notice all the other stuff the article talks about.<p>Now I&#x27;m just bummed out that all this might have spoiled the movie for me (I tried not to read the plot section on Wikipedia, but got a glimpse of the ending as I was scrolling).  Nerd rage is a horrible thing. :)",1381066390

The government is therefore not the taker of all things, but the giver of all things, and let me explain that:<p>The right to private property isn&#x27;t a natural law, or even the natural form of human behavior. Human beings started out living in collective tribes. It&#x27;s not that property was shared, but that there wasn&#x27;t much property at all. Sure, I guess some men objected forcefully to others taking their women, but the transition from women to material property is certainly not an obvious one.<p>Only with the advent of agriculture humans started having anything resembling property at all, and it was their decision to allow property to be owned &quot;privately&quot;. It was society, or &quot;government&quot; if you will, that created the notion of private property through a social contract in the first place.<p>So it is society, or government, that graciously allowed you to &quot;own&quot; anything, but that by no means implied that society could not place restriction on ownership. And if you didn&#x27;t like the rules you were welcome to leave and spend your life away from society.<p>Sure, this arrangement is pretty much the only one that has worked so far, but there have been many revisions and will be many more. But the premise should not be that society infringes on private property, but that the meaning of private property is constantly re-created and negotiated by society.",1381064833

Casual local meals are about one-quarter of those prices.

My recommendation is to take the classes in both areas that you find the most interesting, with no concern for your career.  Your career will span decades and unlikely to involve a steady focus on a single area, as either the environment or you will change.  Personally, I&#x27;ve been working for 11 years in a variety of roles (PM at Microsoft, Product Analyst at a SF startup, Quantitative Developer in finance).<p>You never know where the most valuable lessons will come from and how they will pay off.  For example, my second Real Analysis class leveled up my ability to communicate clearly and precisely in a way that no writing class could have.  Graph theory, automata theory, numerical methods, abstract algebra, and statistics have each made their way into my work, sometimes in ways that I never would have expected.<p>If you want to ignore this, Machine Learning.",1381064609

Lead by example. You should be working at least as hard as anyone else who's reporting to you. Never make a fuss about it. Never complain about it. Just do it;<p>2. Shield your people from crap. Part of your job when you're in a leadership position is to shield them from crap. And by crap I mean things like management BS, customer requirements and so forth. Let them get on with getting the job done. Your job, at least in part, is to deal with these  (typically overblown if not outright imagined) exigencies that customers tend to have. Likewise, your people should spend very little time in meetings, particularly with people outside your team;<p>3. Appreciate that every developer is different. We all like to work in different ways. Some of us are good at (and like)  sailing through uncharted waters. Some like a far more structured environment. It's your job to cater to that to get the most of your people; and<p>4. Make sure each person knows how what they do fits into the big picture. This can be as simple as ""you're writing this component so when the reporting falls over, which happens because of X, Y or Z, the system recovers"". People work better, in my experience, when they have a level of understanding about where their piece of the puzzle goes and why it's important. Again, different people want/need different levels of detail here.<p>Too often management also thinks that team leadership just happens. In my experience, depending on the project and the size of the team, it can take as much as 25-50% of your time. Too often you're still expected to produce work as if you were spending 100% of your time programming however.",1311699574

2808286,comment,2806585,2807104,2,0,ascott,,,"There has been some excellent feedback on this topic already. I just want to point out a distinction that has been glossed over - OSX laptop users have a very different scrolling experience than Windows users (laptops or desktop). The two finger scroll method is very pleasant, and highly accurate. I don't ever have to re-find content while scrolling, because of how tactile and accurate the feedback is.<p>As interfaces get better, I believe the vertical scroll method will be preferred, because it allows the user to quickly skim, jump ahead, or reference previous content, within the same context.<p>To be fair, I had forgotten how different scrolling is with a traditional mouse. This design trade off (arrow keys and next buttons) is probably excellent for windows and traditional mouse users.",1311699490

Look at history and tax revenue as a % of GDP remains remarkably steady despite the top tax rate falling almost 70%(<a href=""http://tinyurl.com/3dgkupq"" rel=""nofollow"">http://tinyurl.com/3dgkupq</a>).  So the old saying that you can't raise taxes higher than the amount it would cost a rich guy to cheat the tax system holds pretty true.<p>Maybe we'll find some miraculous way to fix that problem but as of right now we can't expect huge gains by raising taxes.<p>That means the roughly 43% we owe ourselves either (a) can't be paid back or (b) will have to be borrowed from foreign countries.  Because we can't raise the revenue in time to pay out the debt to pension funds, Social Security and private citizens saving for retirement.<p>So the People/Government who owns America is really whoever will be willing and able to loan us money when the U.S. citizens we owe come to collect their money.",1311699368

I think it's more of a two-way street than the article lets on.<p>Think back to all of the most quirky, creative, interesting, boat-rocking people you've worked with or met. It's not a universal rule that these folks aren't very good at the ""people"" side of the equation...but a lot of them aren't. Furthermore, a lot of them have a marked distaste for toeing the party line. They derive more energy from challening assumptions than from accepting them. Or from reinventing the wheel, instead of using the wheel they've got on hand. They get bored or disgruntled very quickly if they're not being stimulated or challenged.<p>These traits might make for good startup founders, but they don't often correlate with corporate success. Especially at large, traditional, non-tech corporations. In such companies, politics rules the day. Your skill as a politician -- your ability to navigate the waters, network with the right people, kiss the right ass, and sell internally -- is what gets you ahead. Your inability to do so will prevent you from climbing as quickly, or as far, as the savvier operators.<p>Companies say they want more creative leaders, but all incentives are set up to reward politicians. At the same time, a lot of ""creative"" folks opt out of the game in the first place -- either through ineptitude at it, or through an avowed distaste for it. It's unfortunate, but it's true in many, many, many cases.<p>If there's any grand, karmic justice in the whole equation, it's that -- in theory, at least -- the more forward-thinking and ""creative"" companies will win out in the marketplace. Those companies that choose to be ruled by innovation, by results, and not by politics should outperform the companies that choose not to recognize (or even to suppress) their innovative thinkers. It's not as cut-and-dried as this, of course, but that's what those of us disheartened by these articles should hope for in the long run.",1311698994

It's the difference between tearing a person down and motivating them to improve (or to justify their point further as the case may be). Consider the following extreme scenarios:<p>In case A an argument is based on decidedly wrong reasoning or false data, but it's delivered in an accessible and friendly way that encourages further discussion.<p>Case B is a statement that is factually 100% correct and verifiable but it's brought across in a manner designed to be as abrasive as possible and to show off the superiority of the participant.<p>Considering those two extremes, I believe argument A is  more constructive to the overall process because it enabled a productive discussion to continue (if only to show why the argument is mistaken). In contrast, B, not so much. Of course, in reality it gets way more complex than this. Not only is there a spectrum between factual correctness and incorrectness, between being approachable and being obnoxious. The crux is often the ""based on reality"" part, because we also tend to disagree about the pertinence of certain facts to a given discussion. But stating a factually true observation in a context where this observation is not relevant to the issue is often extremely disruptive.<p>To employ an extreme example: person 1 says ""X + Y equals 5"" to which person 2 counters ""but X is a negative number"". Statement 2, while it may well be based on reality, is not constructive criticism - it's misleading and distracting, and it makes person 1 look bad for no reason. In fact, I just had such an interaction on HN a few hours ago. So I believe intentions (and the perceptions thereof) make all the difference when it comes to an exchange being constructive.",1311698688

Asking more questions (or even worse, clarification on an answer) can jeopardize your standing among your bosses, and, by virtue of the culture they cultivate, among your peers.<p>* Missing a deadline for any reason is a permanent mark against you, to be trotted out on every review and used as a reason to keep your salary low (I actually had a boss LOWER my salary, at which point I left in disgust)<p>* Reporting something done is an invitation for a dressing-down, where your boss humiliates you for everything not done to his satisfaction.<p>And so, with a culture of fear firmly in place, the standard operating procedure is:<p>1. Never ask questions. Do a shitty job if you can't do a good job and try to cover it up as best you can, or better yet, unload the project onto someone else.<p>2. Never report something ""done"" if you can avoid it. This gives you some ""wiggle room"" when the boss comes down on you over everything that's wrong with it.<p>3. Never say that you'll miss a deadline. Cut corners if you have to. Miracles sometimes happen. Maybe this time you'll win the lottery.<p>Now that I'm a founder, I'm working hard to undo that culture, keep fear out of the equation, and encourage communication and experimentation (along with the possibility of failure).

Nor did they care about protecting the nation or their national heritage, as the concept of nation itself took centuries to form millenia later and only started playing a major geopolitical role with the French revolution. This isn't to say the tribesmen were multiculturalists; they had their own cultures and were often wary of outsiders, but mostly for reasons of self defense.

I believe that you are stating that it is statistically impossible for Europe to become Muslim, however, the projection wasn't concerned with religion or culture but with the genetic makeup of the population.<p>It was my understanding that the projection comes simply from extrapolating the figures from the past few decades, apart form looking at the age pyramid of Europe and seeing how much immigration will be needed to pay for pensions, health care and so on. I haven't done the math myself so I can't tell you whether it is true. If this is a collaborative effort, then I think it would be wise for someone with the background to dismiss those projections mathematically.<p>However to show that such a demographic change is not such a statistical impossibility, look at US demographics. Ethnic Europeans were around 80% of the US population in the 80s, they are around 60% now and it is projected by the US government itself that in the next few decades they will be below 50%. You can bump that last percentage a little bit to account for those counted as Hispanic whites who are actually predominantly indigenous Europeans. I know US demographics are completely unrelated and have nothing to do with the OP which relates to Europe. This was simply to show how such demographic changes are not impossible. Nevertheless, there could be other variables which I'm not aware of, that make what we've seen in the US possible but impossible in Europe.",1311696702

I guess if you were an expert at web security you could analyze a particular web console and say ""yeah, it looks ok to me and I'm willing to take the risk."" I think Patrick is saying that he doesn't see that being a worthwhile tradeoff for himself (as an expert) and therefore it seems particularly unwise for non-experts to be doing it.<p>There is some buzz about doing cloud to cloud attacks but I haven't heard anything that's been realized yet.

The language of competition not only doesnt appeal to many women, it actually puts them off.</i><p>This doesn't make sense to me because easily the most competitive path I've ever seen is premed. Almost all of the premeds I know are competing for the best grades, the best resumes, and the best internships. Organic chem is like a giant free-for-all where everyone tries to beat the curve. And yet, at least 50% of biology and medical students are women. Why are women turned off by competitiveness in CS (which I think is less common in my engineering classes where people often try to help other people and don't compete for the best grade), but not in medicine?<p>Aren't we just applying cultural influences to both genders in either case?",1311696189

Men didn't want to enter it since after all they could simply be scientists and businessmen instead.

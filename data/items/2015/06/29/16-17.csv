It&#x27;s okay to stay in the office later than most other older engineers.<p>2) Networking/Side projects - talk to other people in the firms, see what they&#x27;re working on and offer help if needed. These might be the same people/team that may hire you for full-time one day<p>3) Learn - Pick at people&#x27;s brains, I know at my firm most people are willing to take some time to help me. Anything that can be found on stackoverflow or a book just use that but it may help to go over some design/implementation stuff with other more experienced engineers.<p>4) Software - Learn from the design and testing flows of the company. Try to separate yourself from the way you write software in class or for yourself and understand the way software is developed at a production level, from test-driven development to properly deploying your software.",1435597199

Then you have to get written quotes from a few vendors who you find that actually do said testing and generally the test houses are just test houses, they don&#x27;t necessarily know the laws of each country they just know how to run the tests and issue you a report, which can take weeks, at best (or you just go to the local place and it costs what it costs).  But <i>you</i> have to know what tests to ask for.<p>There should just be a simple one-stop online form that you fill in your product&#x27;s information and get an instant quote back with each country in the world and what&#x27;s required for your product along with instant quotes (price and lead time) for each of those certifications.  Then, you can check box all the certifications you want right now (likely with discounts if you pick more than one, so a live-updating pricing matrix will be useful here, and a live world map highlighting countries which you can sell in) and pay via credit card for the certifications themselves.  You get in return a mailing label to ship your prototype device to the testing company along with instructions on how the testing company uses your device so they can test it.<p>The actual testing can be contracted out to 3rd parties.  This could just be a broker, but it would have to be a broker that knows the rules of the world and can express those rules in a straight forward way along with instant pricing.

They get their names listed on the cover and everything.<p>Some of these new coloring books for adults may actually serve a very practical purpose: to provide practice material for potential colorists.<p>Speaking of comic books, some of these new coloring books for adults are put out by Marvel Comics. What makes these books &quot;for adults&quot; is that they are filled with un-colored line art from actual comics Marvel has published, and they cherry-pick pages with high levels of detail. You color in one of those books, you&#x27;re replicating work that&#x27;s been done by actual professionals. This isn&#x27;t kids&#x27; stuff at all. It honestly makes me wonder if Marvel is publishing these books specifically as a recruiting tool for colorists.",1435595992

This implies that the association of educational capital growth with conventional measures of total factor production is large, strongly statistically significant, and negative. These are “on average” results, derived from imposing a constant coefficient. However, the development impact of education varied widely across countries and has fallen short of expectations for three possible reasons. First, the institutional/governance environment could have been sufficiently perverse that the accumulation of educational capital lowered economic growth. Second, marginal returns to education could have fallen rapidly as the supply of educated labor expanded while demand remained stagnant. Third, educational quality could have been so low that years of schooling created no human capital. The extent and mix of these three phenomena vary from country to country in explaining the actual economic impact of education, or the lack thereof. \nCopyright Oxford University Press 2001<p><a href=""http://wber.oxfordjournals.org/content/15/3/367.abstract"" rel=""nofollow"">http://wber.oxfordjournals.org/content/15/3/367.abstract</a>",1435595441

Even in the world of intellectual property law, there has been some recognition that the interests of interoperability and ability to communicate may outweigh the benefits of monopoly protection as an incentive to create and share. The US, for example, takes this view in declining copyright protection on the design of typefaces (as distinct from font files that contain software describing those designs in one specific way). And in Europe, good luck getting a software patent that blocks anyone from using your file format or communications protocol.<p>Given that programming to an interface is essentially <i>the</i> way we enable interoperability between different software products, allowing the protection of such interfaces to stand seems absurdly counter-productive. This is particularly true if the protection holds retrospectively for APIs that were previously believed not to be protected in that way by those who chose to write code against them, which would presumably be the case here.<p>If the US allows this position to remain, it could cripple the US software development industry very quickly if the lawyers start throwing their weight around. In practice, as often happens under the US legal system, I expect it would be particularly damaging to the little guy, while the big players would all cross-license their respective portfolios somehow to make the issue go away.",1435594450

I can think of two possibilities, which are worth discussing on their own so it&#x27;s not like I&#x27;m putting words in anybody&#x27;s mouth.<p>One possibility is if you use a lot of data itself on the commute, like streaming audio. That would eventually be problematic (although 5GB is still a good bit of streaming audio). As I hate my audio being at the mercies of networks anyhow, let alone cellular networks, I play things off local storage anyhow, so I&#x27;m not sure about this in practice.<p>The other possibility is if your commute goes through more residential areas. I&#x27;m mostly commuting on a highway going through mostly rural areas and my phone has no WiFi to be confused by. But I have noticed my phone can be really annoying to try to use while walking to my car in a reasonably residential area, while it&#x27;s busy trying to get one of the xfinity_wifi connections, and then failing, then I walk to the next xfinity_wifi connection... end result is that I end up turning off the Wifi radio if I really care. Would be more difficult if this happened in a car. (And some of this is Comcast&#x27;s xfinity_wifi thing where all their modems now emit a secondary SSID for &quot;other customer&quot; access. It&#x27;s neat when I&#x27;m visiting a friend&#x27;s house that has it, but I&#x27;m yet to find it useful generically out and about.)<p>RW certainly mostly works. Perhaps it mostly works slightly less than a dedicated cellular provider, but it also costs a lot less. There&#x27;s some quirks in the cell phones but I&#x27;m unconvinced all of them are RW-related. (The only one that probably is is that sometimes I dial, and after a couple of seconds it returns to the contacts screen like nothing happened, and then about a minute later dials the number. Not sure what&#x27;s up with that exactly.)<p>Edit: My experience does not entirely match eatonphil&#x27;s sibling post. When I turn off wifi, it stays off. It does get overexcited about connections being up when they really aren&#x27;t, which I believe is more an Android thing (Android decides it has a wifi network, RW tries to use it), but of course it affects the service. RW is working on it now. Google probably has twice as many people engineering Project Fi as RW has employees, plus a lot of in-house Android experience they can directly tap for a custom Android distro.<p>I suspect were I not already a customer of RW, I&#x27;d go Project Fi, too.

With RW, they will force you to join any nearby Wifi network - even if it requires you to accept its ToS and you haven&#x27;t done this. So if you are waiting for Amtrak and the opposing train pulls up for 2 minutes, you are switched onto this network. Or if you are in a bus on the highway in traffic and you pass a Wifi hotspot, it will switch you onto it... Even if you turned off Wifi. It constantly turned on Wifi even when you explicitly tell it not to. Google Fi has not done this so far. And, if the public Wifi requires me to accept some ToS, Google Fi will keep me on 3G until I have accepted the ToS and am /actually/ on the internet via the public wifi. So, in the end, RW really pissed me off. Still, it is a cheaper service and as a college student it was all I needed. I stayed on one network 24/7 and had no complaints at the time.<p>Edit: One thing about being forced to switch to a network is that it is silent and you don&#x27;t necessarily know if you are connected to the internet or not. So if you walk into a Starbucks that has public wifi and your wifi is turned off, your wifi will be turned on and you will have no internet connection until you accept Starbucks&#x27; ToS.

Virtually all normal SMTP servers will re-try e-mail delivery several times spaced over at least several hours before rejecting delivery with a notification back to the sender.<p>I have run my own e-mail server for about 17 years, originally from my home and more recently from a data-center where I have co-located my server.  Admittedly, when I had my mail server at my home, I would suffer outages long enough to miss e-mails when I needed to do something as severe as work on my home&#x27;s electrical panel or move.  But generally speaking, a momentary glitch in network connectivity would not result in lost e-mail.  Since moving my server to a data-center, the only downtime I had was when I needed to replace a disk.<p>As the above paragraph suggests, I am <i>strongly</i> in favor of people running their own mail servers and moving away from the presently-popular centralized Internet, back toward a decentralized model.  This device isn&#x27;t for me, and probably isn&#x27;t for several of us here, but it&#x27;s precisely the kind of thing I&#x27;d like to suggest to other people who would not otherwise be comfortable running a mail server.<p>I know a lot of programmers who shiver at the thought of managing their own servers, and I feel that&#x27;s a regretful situation for the Internet at large.  It suggests two things: (a) many programmers fear servers, which I don&#x27;t think is healthy and (b) insufficient R&D has gone into making infrastructure easier to manage.  After all (a) is a rational fear given the state of the art in many cases.  It can in fact be quite difficult to set up a mail server (although once setup, most are pretty hands-off).  It should be much easier to navigate through the settings and have a nearly out-of-the-box configuration that is sane and avoids the most common pitfalls.<p>Aside: Incidentally, I found that even mainstream ISPs like AT&T will unblock port 25 if you call them up and explain you are running your own personal mail server.

You can literally do the same thing you did with PHP in 2007 if you want to (have a controller that outputs xml to be transformed into jquery commands if an ajax call or renders html if not ajax). You could also do something less silly like share your templates (maybe via hiccup and its many cljs implementations or via enlive/enforce/kioo (or via Soy, or anything else really)). If you want to get really fancy, you can actually just render your js server side via nashhorn and then rebind whatever modern rendering library you choose (React, Ember, etc) onto the rendered html at runtime. This is all ignoring the fact that nothing prevents you from serving html from server-side templates and keeping your cljs codebase completely separately ala most web apps (then progressively enhancing with whatever you normally would).",1435593657

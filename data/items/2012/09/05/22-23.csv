If there are 8 startups in a bundle, does investor really want to talk/listen to all of them? An ability to skip startups that are not relevant because of their market niche or their stage is actually a great advantage and will help to focus on those that might be more relevant. I think parallel mode is more productive and active. In linear mode some folks may get bored. nReduce needs to play with timing and notification features that will make it rock. E.g. investor submits questions to 3 startups out of 8 and gets notified when startup reached the question in a queue - this will save time and efforts and make the process more interactive",1346885643

I use this with curl to do ghetto benchmarks.<p>The next major flag is `-n <NUM>` which changes the number of arguments per command call. e.g. `-n 1` will run the command per argument passed to xargs.<p>And the last flag I commonly use is `-I {}`. This sets `{}` as a variable which contains the arguments. (This also forces `-n 1`).

If you consider problem solutions as a choice which are constrained by the currency available to purchase and you increase the currency you increase the choices and then you lose faith in the choice you make. Ok, that sounds too circular, lets try an example.<p>Lets say you're a techy and you want to buy a motherboard for you new desktop. If you're poor, you invest a lot time researching motherboards and then go out and buy the best motherboard you can afford. Often you have to make compromises but that is ok, you only have so much money. Now you take that same scenario where you have up to $500 to spend (I picked that to be 'more money than any motherboard you might put in a desktop costs' number. Now you go to the local computer shop and you can buy <i>any</i> motherboard and you're frozen. How do you choose? Often this is a much harder place to be.<p>The problem manifests itself as too many choices. So once you have too much money you can't efficiently choose (no forcing function to give up) and once you have too much experience programming its harder to choose a path which has known deficiencies, hence the OP's issue. Also called analysis paralysis, but the enabling factor is that you have enough currency for too many choices.",1346884539

Most ""western"" people seem to see anonymity or even pseudoanonymity as something you use when you have something to hide, something you don't want traced back to you. Everything else, they don't seem to mind having their real name (or a pseudonym that they make little attempt to disguise) attached to. Or, on a different level, people believe that you need to have some kind of identity that you care about, a reputation that you want to uphold, to keep discussion civil and meaningful, and that this should be the key element differentiating an online community.<p>On the other hand, the default in my mind is anonymous discussion. You only don a pseudonym or reveal your true identity when it's actually relevant to the conversation, and immediately stop when it isn't -- people usually don't care about who I am, but they might care about what I have to say. As an example of this, I've browsed Hacker News daily for over a year now, and just recently got around to creating an account. I <i>still</i> feel uneasy about it, even though I'm posting with nothing but a pseudonym, and not posting about anything that I would particularly care about having traced back to me. I doubt Hacker News would have the same culture if it had allowed anonymous posting, but <i>I</i> certainly would have started contributing much earlier if I didn't have to create a pseudo-identity to do so.<p>It's important to note that while it might be true that Reddit serves as the West's 2chan, the two deliver markedly different experiences. 2chan being as enormous as it is (millions of posts per day) should indicate to you that there is some itch that a giant collection of anonymous textboards can scratch that Reddit can't.",1346884124

I happen to know personally the designer of one of the first pieces of personal finance software -- ""Electric Checkbook"" for Macintosh. (There's a site going by that name that appears to have been started by his son.) It was the template from which Quicken was largely derived, but that's a long, sad, and dirty story.<p>The advantage of Electric Checkbook over any of the competition, its creator told me, was implicit in the name: it literally worked just like a checkbook with on-screen checks you fill out and an option to print your electronic checks as real checks. It was far easier and more comfortable to use than any of the professional accounting systems out there because it offered the average user the comfort of the familiar.<p>That Apple successfully deploys skeuomorphism in order to make its average user base feel at ease is a big part of why they're so much better than any other tech company out there. So what if iBooks looks just like a bookshelf, to no functional use whatever. It helps avid readers get into the reading zone, giving them a bit of the joy of perusing their favorite real bookshelves. And that's an edge over the competition.<p>And no, Microsoft Bob didn't lose because of skeuomorphism. Microsoft Bob lost because it was tacky.",1346882923

I also had a nerve conduction test which came out perfect, so there's no impingement in the extremity itself.<p>Be careful with standing desks, because my shoulder tendinitis developed after switching to a standing desk and typing with my arm unsupported for a few months.<p>Not be self-promotional, but as a hobby I put together a website where I do reviews of RSI equipment for beer money: www.RSIinformation.com  Most of what I would write in this comment is already elaborated quite a bit on the site.<p>The one thing that I would pass along is that tendon injuries do not heal correctly without stress. This means that tendinitis/tendinosis and a lot of other RSI issues will not heal simply from rest; you must ""rehab"" the tendon with exercise, but make sure it's the right kind.<p>I only wish that I knew 10 years ago when I know now, so if anybody is having issues, hit me up via email and I'm glad to help.

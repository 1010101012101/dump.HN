It blew me away. The scientist who worked on it talked about eye strain and how 200 ppi was the 'magic' spot where more thank 75% of the people stopped noticing the strain of making lines out of pixels.<p>So after unpacking my ipad3 one of the first things I did was to download the Economist app (my favorite btw) and bring up the latest issue on both the ipad1 and ipad3. Side by side the difference is very visible, absolutely can distinguish between the ipad1 and 3 with p < 0.01 :-) More interestingly comparing the ipad3 version to the print magazine its clear that the ipad3 is pretty much identical from my eyes perspective (disclaimer I do wear glasses, no 20/10 vision here).<p>Now if I could convince folks that send me catalogs to offer an ipad version I'll be in good shape.",1331931091

If there were a place for young folks to live where you could get a room w/space for a bed and a desk, shared bathroom/showers, and 2 meals/day for, say $300-500/mo in Boston, I bet they would fill up. Allow people to focus on finding work, give them a leg up of sorts.<p>I have two responses here:<p>A) In Boston, it would never be allowed.  Boston-Cambridge municipalities have <i>LOVED</i> the boom in rental values from both the growing student populations and their low unemployment rates.  Why would they ruin a good thing by allowing new building, let along ugly, high-density boarding houses that resemble nothing more than <i>student</i> housing?  And everyone official in Boston who isn't a student despises students.<p>B) I've thought of starting just this, but it WOULD be your college dorm (or at least, in the style of my old college dorms).  Checks on room conditions every so often, eviction for damage or partying too much, month-to-month tenancy.  You're missing an angle here: many people <i>like</i> the dorm/boarding-house lifestyle better than the apartment/house lifestyle.  Many people <i>enjoy</i> not owning very much and having the majority of their life be ""out there"".<p>C) That fact leaves us with the opportunity to create a social environment for the long-term residents <i>and</i> to branch off into things like supplying network access or food-service.<p>In short, this is an <i>amply</i> viable business model (works for all the damn colleges!) that never gets used due to municipal and cultural biases against it.",1331930848

In the desktop-centric past there were apps I used that were killed off but I continued using for years afterward because the existing code didn't suddenly stop working when it wasn't being supported anymore.   The web gives you no safety net here, once the app is killed the servers are likely to be brought offline within a matter of days/weeks and then you're usually SOL.<p>Feels bad man.",1331930769

Every one of those is on the list for two reasons:<p>1) Being very large (""too big to fail"").<p>2) Having done stupid things which would have been legal under the restrictions of Glass-Steagall.  The details of what each did differ, but in every case the stupid actions did not cross a line between retail and investment arms, or retail and insurance arms.<p>I think that, if you review the list, it's screamingly obvious that <i>size</i> matters hugely, and any regulation reasonably expected to stop the ""too big to fail"" problem should be looked at very favourably.  (Note:  No such regulation has been passed, or seriously proposed.)  And to a lesser degree, there are some good arguments to be made for bringing regulation of the ""shadow banking"" sector into line with the rest of the industry, extending deposit insurance to money market accounts[1], and possibly for reducing government involvement in the mortgage industry[2].<p>What's <i>not</i> obvious is why a regulation that banned something <i>none</i> of the entries on that list were doing would have helped.  You say that it had a ""chilling effect"", but I'm sceptical.  If it wasn't for Glass-Steagall, AIG wouldn't have decided to bet the farm on house price stability?  Can you articulate any mechanism for how this might have occured?<p>(If only Citigroup or Wachovia had failed, there'd be an argument that Glass-Steagall repeal helped create ""too big to fail"" companies by allowing large specialized firms to merge into behomoth diversified firms - but of course, none of those diversified firms failed.  If anything, there's a better argument for how Glass-Steagall repeal helped reduce the damage from the crisis.)<p>[1]: These factors were significantly involved in several of the largest bank failures.<p>[2]: From the point of view of the taxpayer, the most expensive failures all involved mortgages, most of all Fanny Mae.  Abolishing the GSEs and walking back the bi-partisan multi-decade obsession with boosting home ownership rates seems sensible to me.  Even today, the idea is highly controversial though.",1331929873

Instead, it is designed \n  specifically to help people that don't want to put up with those \n  difficulties.\n\n  However, since the proposal is for a comparatively small tweak to \n  the language syntax with no semantic changes, it is feasible to \n  support it as a third party import hook. While such an import hook \n  imposes some import time overhead, and requires additional steps \n  from each application that needs it to get the hook in place, it \n  allows applications that target Python 3.2 to use libraries and \n  frameworks that would otherwise only run on Python 3.3+ due to their \n  use of unicode literal prefixes.\n\n  One such import hook project is Vinay Sajip's uprefix [4].\n\n  For those that prefer to translate their code in advance rather than \n  converting on the fly at import time, Armin Ronacher is working on a \n  hook that runs at install time rather than during import [5].\n\n  Combining the two approaches is of course also possible. For \n  example, the import hook could be used for rapid edit-test cycles \n  during local development, but the install hook for continuous \n  integration tasks and deployment on Python 3.2.\n\n  The approaches described in this section may prove useful, for \n  example, for applications that wish to target Python 3 on the Ubuntu \n  12.04 LTS release, which will ship with Python 2.7 and 3.2 as \n  officially supported Python versions.</code></pre>",1331929515

External components would make a call, saying something like ""I need the data for this particular patient from this particular hospital"". The engine would then spawn off a thread containing the scraping code for that particular hospital, and it would run off, scrape the website and then return a well formatted version of that data or one of a series of error messages. If the thread got hung up, the engine killed it and returned an error.<p>We built the engine when we realized that these scrapers were a competitive advantage for the company and we'd be writing a lot of them (when I left, we had around 250 of them with a backlog of near 1000 to be written). It became worth the investment to write the framework because there were features we wanted that would have been hell to integrate any other way - for instance, killing long-running scrapers that may have been hung up. The engine bought us lots of other niceties too - for instance, centralized error reporting. If one particular scraper returned lots of errors, odds are that the site changed and we knew to give the code some attention.<p>When you describe it as a ""big enough fence"", that's only partially true.

This doesn't match the media coverage at all -- I suppose we'll all find out when they release the full episode.  The impression I get from these parts:<p>>""In our original broadcast, <i>we fact checked all the things that Daisey said about Apple's operations in China,"" says Glass, ""and those parts of his story were true</i>, except for the underage workers, who are rare.""<p>>Some of the falsehoods found in Daisey's monologue are small ones: the number of factories Daisey visited in China, for instance, and the number of workers he spoke with. Others are large. In his monologue he claims to have met a group of workers who were poisoned on an iPhone assembly line by a chemical called n-hexane. <i>Apple's audits of its suppliers show that an incident like this occurred in a factory in China</i>, but the factory wasnt located in Shenzhen, where Daisey visited.<p>>""It happened nearly a thousand miles away, in a city called Suzhou,"" Marketplaces Schmitz says in his report. ""Ive interviewed these workers, so I knew the story. And when I heard Daiseys monologue on the radio, I wondered: Howd they get all the way down to Shenzhen? It seemed crazy, that somehow Daisey couldve met a few of them during his trip.""<p>But he mushed them all together into a narrative and framed it as if he has personally seen and talked with these people.<p>Skimming the mainstream coverage I get the impression that both his personal story and the facts about the manufacturing culture were equally wrong.  So he did the cause was fighting for vastly more harm than good: people now believe the problem itself doesn't exist.  Whoops.  Way to go dude.<p>I'll be interested to hear the correction episode to see how they detangle the falsehoods in the author's personal story vs things that aren't happening (or aren't happening with enough frequency to be concerned about.)<p>Certainly suggesting that a westerner with a single week in China would encounter all these problems exaggerates their frequency even if the problems are real.  It suggests that if he can find all this out so easily, what else must be going on?  On the other hand, many of his claims about conditions so seem to be real issues backed by other reporting.

Unabashed, aggressive, and strident. If you didn't read the docs then why are you even talking? That kind of attitude. iOS more than any other language is a club for readers, because devs here respect the legacy of code. But since I am American and because I have my pick of whatever platform or language, I have a choice. No matter what my situation, what excuse I may make, at the end of the day I chose iOS and I adopted Apple's culture. But, if I were in a different situation, where there really isn't another job out there, and culture is not really a choice, and I was forced to perform on such a level (and Apple's culture bleeds into every facet of its organization, software, hardware, sales) it might be a waking nightmare. It is one thing to embrace the grind to stay up night after night, eating garbage, working on your next startup because it is in your blood, and being broke and poor and performing to the beat of a driven man's rhythm.<p>#2 I'm sure there is a significant reason why China doesn't see the release of iOS products until much later but it still just rubs me the wrong way. Having iOS products released sooner than later in your country is a privilege. Does the country that make these products not deserve that privilege?<p>I love This American Life, I love iOS and the objective-c language, and am an admirer of Steve Jobs and the company he created. I don't have any heated feeling about anyone in all this so let me say I have nothing but respect for all parties involved. However there is a common thread in all this between Apple, Steve, China and startup culture--the pursuit of excellence at the cost of normal human needs, and the amount of suffering/neglect man is willing to put himself through to achieve his/her goals--that widened my eyes, because it somehow reminded me of what I was doing to myself. You all know what I'm talking about. If you have ever hustled, tried your hand as a founder, embraced the grind you know; the depth of depravity we all put yourselves through to reach an ephemeral goal. It has no taste though sweet in our minds. Always driven with trained eyes unwavering stares, focused, mental, cold as some might describe us. All for what? But to perform at a high level. All else being secondary.<p>I look forward to the corrections episode and am working harder to embrace my fun side.",1331928035

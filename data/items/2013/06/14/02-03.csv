I agree that it is probably not compatible with the details Google has divulged about its &quot;SFTP and manually by human only&quot; process. But that is only one of the many companies.<p>I understand the &quot;slides or GTFO&quot; attitude that I&#x27;m seeing in these claims that the original story is inaccurate, but I think it&#x27;s a bit arrogant and premature. A journalist who has seen the entire slide deck continues to tell us that the nature of what the whole presentation reveals is more invasive than a digital lockbox with workflow management software where humans meaningfully verify, evaluate, and approve requests. He could have misinterpreted the slides, but I doubt he would stick to the report so steadfastly once all these objections arose if he were not pretty confident he understood the claims in the Prism presentation.<p>We shouldn&#x27;t accept that the NSA can grab a user profile without explicit, individual legal approval from the company as fact yet--there&#x27;s a lot more we will hopefully learn. And how true this is could vary from company to company. But it&#x27;s silly to ignore that a credible voice who has seen the presentation is telling us something.",1371178337

I found out last semester, when I wrote out lecture notes on an ipad that there are many words I literally forgot how to spell.  I can type them, and I can write them with a pen, but writing with a stylus is different enough that it took several seconds of concentration before I could write it down.  I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if there are words or phrases at I always capitalize.",1371175531

While there&#x27;d clearly be value in them inserting or subverting network hops between &quot;the great unwashed&quot; and gmail/facebook/aim servers, there&#x27;s very little chance the NSA have access to hops along the path between my (Australian) adsl connection and my vps (located in Australia).<p>For internal (or routed through) US traffic - while Verizon&#x27;s lack of interest in protecting customer data is probably shared by major backbone providers - I _strongly_ doubt even the NSA has enough gear hanging off backbones to actively MITM any significant proportion of the firehose that&#x27;d represent. Even the AT&T &quot;secret room&quot; probably doesn&#x27;t house enough gear to be able to create fake(signed)certs and MITM every SSL connection for millions or more simultaneous users browsing every https site under the sun.<p>Having said that, I&#x27;d bet good money the _do_ target specific SSL traffic - has anyone checked the SSL connections to TOR entry and exit points recently?

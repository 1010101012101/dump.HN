136657,comment,136364,136364,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"I found this explanation far more confusing than a good explanation of continuations (of which I've seen several).  And giving them a new name is bad mojo.<p>I believe the brief description being derided in this article, ""the remaining work to be done"", would be fine if it included the important bit: state.  As he rightly points out, the work isn't the important bit...it's the state of the work+data that matters in continuations, and I didn't find his explanation really made that as clear as several other tutorials out there.  Comparing it to goto was particularly uncomfortable for me (because again, it's the state that matters...and goto is effectively stateless in this context, and has the same flaw as just saying ""the remaining work to be done"").  The key to continuations is that you pick up where you left off with all data (the stack, as pg points out) intact.<p>So, pg has it right, of course, but I'm not sure very many dynamic language developers really have a very good comprehension of ""the stack"".",1205480802

By the way, some people are concerned about privacy. Don't you think it should be their choice to use google bar & dns request smartness or not ?<p>If Dell would provide a first time loging dialog asking the user if he want to use google toolbar with this and this benefit it would be a much different situation.",1205480064

I have friends who, while working at Google, had recruiters contact them to ask if they were interested in working for Google.<p>I'd say listening to what someone is saying and assessing whether they might be more interested six months later requires far more sophisticated thought processes than looking up whether someone already works at Google before trying to recruit them -- so making sure that you're very explicit about what you want them to do (mark your file as 'do not contact') is probably a good idea.",1205479608

The only difference between most geeks and most drug dealers is that society sees one as a good guy and one as a bad guy.",1205478756

Thus reducing anonymous spam and identifying compromised systems, also better identification of suspect routes/sources.<p>- Fax machines will evolve into some sort of fax via internet machine, probably merge into email but still be a plug and go option for businesses.<p>- Phone books will be dead - there will be a new cloud based directory (likely government subsidized or regulated to enforce access and consistency)<p>- The desktop wont die, but the mass consumer market will move onto cloud appliance stuff.<p>- Land Line phones are become very obsolete.<p>- With the transition to the internet there will be government subsidies/programs/grants for every citizen to have a reachable ""address"" and be educated on access to the internet.

""One guy got to the fifth knot and blacked out underwater. We pulled him up and he was, like, dead. They made the class face the fence while they tried to resuscitate him. The first words as he spit out water were 'Did I pass? Did I tie the fifth knot?'

You passed.'""<p><i></i><i></i>*<p>There are the now-famous pranks with a giant dildo  they called it the Staff of Power  discovered during training in an abandoned Miami building. SEALs would find photos of it inserted into their gas masks or at the bottom of a barrel of animal crackers they were eating. Goats were put in their personal cages at ST6 headquarters. Uniforms were borrowed and dyed pink. Boots were glued to the floor. Flash-bang grenades went off in their gear.<p>The area near the Shooter's cage was such a target for outlandish stunts that it was called the Gaza Strip.<p>Even in action, with all their high state of expertise and readiness, ""we're normal people. We fall off ladders, land on the wrong roof, get bitten by dogs."" In Iraq, a breacher was putting a charge on a door to blow it off its hinges when he mistakenly leaned against the doorbell. He quickly took off the charge and the target opened the door. We were like, ""You rang the fucking doorbell?!"" Maybe we should try that more often, the Shooter thought to himself.<p>The dead can also be funny, as long as it's not your guys.

(The Navy does offer decent life-insurance policies at low rates.) ""College will be paid for, they'll be fine.<p>""But if I come back alive and retire, I won't have a pot to piss in or a window to throw it out for the rest of my life.

I'm not referring to Expose, I'm referring to the dynamic workspace allocation (which, after using it, I prefer to the ""4 virtual workspaces"" approach) and the really very nice gesture support that doesn't exist out-of-the-box in Ubuntu. (While it may exist in some other form, if I have to do anything beyond ""turn it on"" I'm basically uninterested.)<p>If your OS doesn't do the little things I want, investing time into the bigger things doesn't make a lot of sense. This may be a recurring theme here.<p><i>> As someone who pays for an uses IntelliJ, I don't even know what the hell that means.</i><p>IntelliJ's font rendering was/is hosed in Ubuntu 12.04 out of the box and looked absolutely terrible. There may be a fix for it, but I didn't bother to look because the benefits to Ubuntu over OS X were not, <i>for me</i>, significant enough to invest time into solving the problem.<p><i>> [re: Xcode] And that's a good thing.</i><p>See, there you go. Your priorities do not mesh with mine or with others'. Why would you expect that they use your OS of choice if the tools of their choice do not exist?<p>I like Xcode. I like it more than Eclipse or QtCreator or KDevelop and I like it much more than vim+ctags. If the tools I like do not exist on a platform, that platform had better provide a big enough benefit to make me want to switch--and, your rageposting notwithstanding, <i>Linux does not</i>. Sorry?<p><i>> LOL. Is this even a serious point? Hello? VMWare Workstation? KVM+QEMU? Xen?</i><p>Yes, it's quite serious. KVM+QEMU does not (AFAIK--I may be wrong) have one-click out-of-the-box support for accelerated graphics. I did not examine Xen, but a cursory Google looks like more work than it's worth unless the OS otherwise makes a switch worthwhile (which it did not).<p>VMware Workstation did not have VMware Fusion-level support for accelerated graphics last I looked; maybe Workstation 9 is better, but I have not checked. I play games through VMware Fusion; just played XCOM on my flight today from Boston to Nashville. Having good graphics acceleration in my virtual machine matters to me.<p><i>> [re: MacVim/GVim] Are you fucking kidding me?</i><p>No, I'm quite serious. MacVim solves my biggest beef with GVim (the lack of good windowed-environment shortcuts) by melding in the OS X shortcuts--which also happen to be out-of-band keystrokes that Vim can't misinterpret. (This is also a plus to terminal usage on OS X; I often find myself highlighting something--I don't like copy on highlight--and reflexively pressing Ctrl-C on Linux or a Windows SSH session. I often find myself regretting it. I used to think OS X's Command key was stupid...but after a while using it, I vastly prefer it to the alternative.)<p><i>> Oh you're cute. I shouldn't have wasted my time replying to an obvious troll.</i><p>Even among developers, Linux on the desktop is a small minority. Maybe ""niche"" was understating it a little, but...not by much.<p>Anyway, different priorities does not imply trolling. I'm glad your solution works for you.

If you sum up the PS3's total FLOPS, the cell processors do give it a total advantage in FLOPS. But this is very misleading - obviously FLOPS are only useful if the architecture enables you to use them towards what you need.<p>Almost nobody used ""cell processors"" to potential initially, and for very good reason [2]. The bottom line is they were incredibly difficult to program for in any useful way to graphics. But more than that, they are limited in very specific ways [3]. They won't increase triangle throughput, and they don't directly increase pixel throughput.<p>In some extremely rare cases, some game engines found a way to use them for graphics (like Battlefield 3's Frostbite 2 engine towards the deferred lighting passes). But by the time engineers found a way to leverage this extremely complex architecture, it was already too late. If you actually look at most Xbox360 vs PS3 games side by side, the Xbox360 often looks much better.<p>In this case though (the next gen Xbox and Playstation) the situation is reversed: Sony's GPU is actually legitimately faster, and by a large margin. Not only that, but having a full 4GB of fast ram is a HUGE advantage to Sony. High performance 3D rendering is inherently a bandwidth hog, because everything on the screen <i>must</i> be pushed through the pipes every single frame. Having a fast 32MB cache doesn't really help you if you want to consistently and smoothly render more than 32MB of content on the screen. And moreover, just as the last generation PS3 had an overly complex architecture making it difficult to reach its full potential, it seems Xbox and Playstation are swapping roles here as well with this generation.<p>[1] <a href=""http://forums.gametrailers.com/viewtopic.php?f=23&t=794700"" rel=""nofollow"">http://forums.gametrailers.com/viewtopic.php?f=23&t=7947...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.videogamer.com/ps3/saints_row_2/news/two_or_three_years_till_ps3_graphics_better_than_360.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.videogamer.com/ps3/saints_row_2/news/two_or_three...</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1355827/what-does-programming-for-ps3s-cell-processor-entail"" rel=""nofollow"">http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1355827/what-does-program...</a>",1361212830

He put Apple's failure to capture the mass market back then to Apple leaving a price umbrella under which Windows could grow to dominate the market, and stated that Apple would make sure not to do that with what we now call iOS devices. I think Apple's strategy is to lower prices as required to maintain a viable market share, but keep them high enough to dominate in terms of profit share.<p>It may well turn out that the business model (licensed OS versus integrated hardware/software) doesn't actually matter all that much.",1361212361

I wrote a previous comment on HN [1] on the same subject, which I'll paste here as the points still apply:<p><i>This is welcome from Google, as focused aid of this sort can often have an outsize effect, but we must be careful to avoid believing this can solve the problem.</i><p><i>For one, sophisticated UAVs that are much more capable than those the WWF is getting are already being used to combat rhino poaching. SANParks, the state agency responsible for South Africa's state-run national parks, has deployed the Seeker II military-spec UAV[0], ground radar, thermal imagers, cameras and dedicated teams of heavily armed rangers in the Kruger National Park, one of Africa's largest wildlife reserves. All anti-poaching resources have been placed under the command of Major General Johan Jooste, a highly-regarded retired military commander and a rewards program giving approximately US$ 10 000 to anybody whose tip-off results in the arrest of a poacher and about US$ 100 000 for a tip-off leading to the arrest of the head of a poaching syndicate has been created. At the same time the South African Army has deployed units in both the border patrol and anti-poaching role in certain parks.</i><p><i>These measures are all helping, but it's important to understand just what an impossible task this is. SANParks's 19 national parks alone cover 37 000 km, that's larger than Belgium, Israel and Lebanon. Moreover those 19 parks are dispersed across South Africa's 1.2 million km and many of them are on the border of neighbouring countries from which many of these poachers come. It also doesn't include the hundreds of private wildlife reserves across the country which have been badly hit by rhino poaching. As the US has discovered on its southern border with Mexico, trying to prevent small bands of people from crossing a border this large is impossible even with UAVs, manned aircraft and massive resources.</i><p><i>So technology alone is not going to solve this, though it and other measures are hopefully going to help reduce the rate at which rhinos are being killed. The only long-term solution is to somehow stop the demand for rhino horn from Asia and thus remove the profit motive for poaching rhinos in the first place.</i><p><i>[0] The Seeker II is a 9-12 hour endurance UAV with all the standard surveillance gear such as FLIR cameras that is being provided free of charge by Denel, a South African arms manufacturer. The intention is to supplement that with a longer-ranged model, the Seeker 400, sometime next year. At the same time they're finalising development of a much smaller UAV, the Hungwe, that can be deployed by ranger teams for short-range surveillance.</i><p>[1]<a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4936947"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4936947</a>",1361212132

In fact the cause was embarrassingly stupid.<p>On a comment thread, a new user had posted some replies as siblings\ninstead of children.  I posted a comment explaining how HN worked.\nBut then I decided to just fix it for him by doing some surgery in\nthe repl.  Unfortunately I used the wrong id for one of the comments\nand created a loop in the comment tree; I caused an item to be its\nown grandchild.  After which, when anyone tried to view the thread,\nthe server would try to generate an infinitely long page.  The\nstory in question was on the frontpage, so this happened a lot.<p>For some reason I didn't check the comments after the surgery to\nsee if they were in the right place. I must have been distracted\nby something.  So I didn't notice anything was wrong till a bit\nlater when the server seemed to be swamped.<p>When I tailed the logs to see what was going on, the pattern looked\na lot like what happens when HN runs short of memory and starts\nGCing too much.  Whether it was that or something else, such problems\ncan usually be fixed by restarting HN.  So that's what I did.  But\nfirst, since I had been writing code that day, I pushed the latest\nversion to the server.  As long as I was going to have to restart\nHN, I might as well get a fresh version.<p>After I restarted HN, the problem was still there.  So I guessed\nthe problem must be due to something in the code I'd written that\nday, and tried reverting to the previous version, and restarting the\nserver again.  But the problem was still there.  Then we (because\nby this point I'd managed to get hold of Nick Sivo, YC's hacker in\nresidence) tried reverting to the version of HN that was on the old\nserver, and that didn't work either.  We knew that code had worked\nfine, so we figured the problem must be with the new server.  So\nwe tried to switch back to the old server.  I don't know if Nick\nsucceeded, because in the middle of this I gave up and went to bed.<p>When I woke up this morning, Rtm had HN running on the new server.\nThe bad thread was still there, but it had been pushed off the\nfrontpage by newer stuff.  So HN as a whole wasn't dying, but there\nwere still signs something was amiss, e.g.  that /threads?id=pg\ndidn't work, because of the comment I made on the thread with the\nloop in it.<p>Eventually Rtm noticed that the problem seemed to be related to a\ncertain item id.  When I looked at the item on disk I realized what\nmust have happened.<p>So I did some more surgery in the repl, this time more carefully,\nand everything seems fine now.<p>Sorry about that.",1361211965

5239660,comment,5238837,5239295,4,0,qxf2,,,"Totally agree. The emotional variance a salesperson has to endure on a day to day basis is very, very high. We engineers are lucky to work in a rational space. When things work, they work. When things don't work we can apply rational thought and fix the problem a majority of the time. You can deal with emotional/people issues via straight talk, through your manager, avoidance and/or just quitting. With sales and marketing, they are grappling with a fundamentally irrational (or at least opaque) set of constraints - people, their moods, budget cycles, company processes, etc. Its hard.<p>I used to think sales and marketing was at par or below engineering. My thinking changed over the years thanks to something I saw first hand. My previous employer had a large, all hands on deck, one week long conference every year. As an engineer I would observe how our sales team would interact with clients. Clients, especially the bigger ones, would treat them very badly. Our sales members would put on a cheerful face and continue with their jobs. I would have walked out if I had been treated like that in public. I can only imagine how bad the treatment is when its in private. I've been much more polite to salespeople, even to pushy salespeople, ever since then. I actually take time to reply to (generic) emails for products that I signed up for a trial offer.",1361211794

The server-side time is only a portion of that, but it's clearly delineated.<p>Note that they were using New Relic as part of an expensive add-on package from Heroku.  It gave them a queue time value in it's reports, but it was extremely misleading, since the only value it showed was for the router queue time, which should have always been extremely low (and was displayed as such).  It didn't say ""router queue time"" or ""dyno queue time shown elsewhere"".<p>Since New Relic is supposed to be showing them everything that happens with their request on Heroku's servers, it seems logical that it would include dyno queue times.<p>Javascript-enabled monitoring would only show you that the request times are much longer than what Heroku says they are, then you still have to troubleshoot down to figuring out why.<p>> Unfortunately they picked a number (queue time) that doesn't have much functional basis on Heroku's stack at the moment, which weakens their argument.<p>I don't think it weakens their argument as it clearly shows that the biggest problem they have is not only out of their control (even with very short run-times, the higher the number of requests you have per minute, the more this problem is going to affect you) but that even buying very expensive tools integrated into Heroku's ""stack"" will not help you to see where the problem is.  The tools were basically hiding the one problem that was solely Heroku's responsibility.<p>Do not forget that even while there were a lot of statistics about how long running requests can cause other, much shorter requests to take just as long and even timeout, the heart of the matter is that even with a high number of extremely short requests, the router can end up sending many requests to a single dyno while other dynos remain idle.  There were plenty of graphs, even animated to show you the effect over time for this random dyno routing.",1361210855

Hollywood was really hoping to get a technical solution to DRM and not a purely legal one.  (Of course it failed in the end.)<p>The real reason why these broken DRM systems like HDCP and AACS are still around is because there are millions of players/TVs/discs in the field and you can't break all of them by introducing a new DRM system.

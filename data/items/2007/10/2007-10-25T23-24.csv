Generally, if something is worthwhile, but not critical, it's worth spending the 20% of the time to get it 80% of the way there, and doing <i></i>five<i></i> such slipshod jobs, rather than one perfect one.<p>This is contrary to every reasonable software engineering practice, which is probably because it works better for things which aren't software, like user testing or business planning.",1193354894

72725,comment,72698,72698,0,0,bluishgreen,,,"Agreed, better than v1. Just one more design bug: avoid gradients. Just avoid it. Gradients are bad. Its very hard to create pleasant gradients. apple.com pulls it off.and thats not encouraging, because you know who designs for them. Do you really want to throw that kinda money at design. Take the easier way out. Avoid gradients.   <p>Other than that, we just have to use this thing to give more useful feedback beyond site design. Roll on with the beta. ",1193354711

And the white space issue applies to the listing page as well. <p>But again, these little details are not what makes Web sites succeed or fail. Unfortunately, most of the feedback you get here will probably focus on the design because that's the easiest thing to comment on. If you want real feedback, talk to your customers. Even better, watch what they do or not do and study their behavior. ",1193354283

72717,comment,72535,72535,0,0,Shooter,,,"I used Hypercard very briefly before moving on to MetaCard, which was more powerful, cross-platform, and had better color and multimedia support.  I built a bunch of monster stacks in MetaCard, including a complete ERP system for a 350 person company (!)<p>I found that both tools were incredibly productive and actually made it much easier for me to jump to Lisp because I was already familiar with things that would seem 'magic' to programmers using more traditional tools.  The productivity, dynamic features, and 'macros' had me programming circles around some of my competitors in my niche at the time.  Many people thought the <i>Card tools were toys, but they allowed faster development than anything out there and my compiled stacks STILL run faster than, say, Java.  Yes, even today. I know this because I benchmarked it recently.  One company is STILL using the MetaCard-based ERP system I wrote, and a video store chain is still using a POS system I co-wrote.<p>When the MetaCard technology was sold, I moved on to using a tool by the buyer of the technology, a Scottish company called Runtime Revolution.  By that time, I had discovered some other tools that were also very powerful and I was focusing on mostly web apps, so I stopped using the </i>Card technology.  (Even though the tool has internet features built-in.)  I still know some companies that have great products on the market that are secretly based on *Card technology, though. <p>If you are really into HyperCard-type technology, you should check out www.runrev.com.  In some ways, it is still ahead of many of the alternatives.  In fact, I have an enterprise license and a training book that I'm not using if you want to contact me.  There is also a Python-based Hypercard-like system around that you should look at, although it is much more primitive.",1193353928

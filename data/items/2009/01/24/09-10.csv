447963,comment,446989,446989,0,0,olavk,,,"Here's the deal: CSS was designed to have all the styling and layout power of presentational HTML, and more. Even universally hated features like ""blink"" were supported, so nobody would have to use presenational HTML ever again.<p>So what whent wrong with tables? The culprit is that the CSS equivalent of tables, the <i>display:table</i> CSS property (defined in CSS 2) has not been implemented in Internet Explorer yet, even though the standard is 12 years old (IE8 will reportedly support it, though).<p>So there is no direct CSS equivalent to the layout properties of tables which works in IE. You can emulate some of the properties using floats, absolute positioning and so on, but be aware that this approach is <i>not</i> the ""correct"" CSS way. Rather it is a workaround around limitations in IE's <i>implementation</i> of CSS. Using tables for layout is a alternative workaround for the same problem. The approaches have different tradeoffs.<p>The main tradeoff is that HTML-tables are bad for accessibility, while CSS alternatives are often convoluted and hard to maintain. So the choice is basically if you want to cause pain for yourself or for disabled people. Its not hard to understand how this debate turns into more of a moral than a technical discussion.<p>Note that it is not <i>all</i> uses of tables which require workarounds to implement in table-less CSS. Before CSS, tables were used for a wide array of layout tasks like spacing, margins, positioning and so on, which is generally better handled by CSS today. The limitations are specifically when tables are used as dynamically adjusting grids. I wrote a small article to point out the concrete issues: <a href=""http://olav.dk/articles/tables.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://olav.dk/articles/tables.html</a><p>BTW - it's a myth that tables render the same across browsers. Table rendering has about the same amount of inconsistencies and browser differences as CSS. The difference is that there is no ""right way"" to render tables, since table rendering is not specified anywhere. It's all just a chain of reverse-engeneering leading back to the first haphazard table implemtation in Netscape 1.1. With CSS there is at least a spec, and the hope that browsers implentations move incrementally closer to the spec.",1232791115

Everything from Conway's Game of Life to C++ template specialization to Ruby is Turing complete.

447947,comment,447435,447571,0,0,kragen,,,"Operating systems are a means to an end other than building an application.  Libraries are a means to the end of building an application.  Operating systems are a means to a different end: running multiple applications together.<p>The way that operating systems do this has changed over the years.  At first, it was just by letting one run while the other is waiting on the tape drive, or the user.  Later, it was by letting one read the files of the other, or by permitting you to readily use hundreds of kilobytes of memory on a 16-bit machine by connecting processes through FIFOs, or by allowing objects in one process to call methods on objects in another.<p>There were a number of kinds of interactions between applications that seem like they should be more straightforward to build in Plan 9 than in Linux.  I don't have any experience with Plan 9, so I could be wrong about these:<p>Untrusted processes in Plan 9 can do the equivalent of chroot, and because things like network access go through the filesystem, chrooting them can restrict those things too.  Something like VNC, providing a shared window to run graphical applications in, should be nearly trivial to build in 8½, and wouldn't lose accelerated graphics --- it should even be easier than in the VT-100 world where screen runs.  Virtual desktop software should be easier, and work better, in 8½ than in X (at least prior to Compiz).  Spreading such a large virtual display across more than one physical display, as with x2x (but with the ability to move windows between them) is the same problem as the shared display.  A networked chat application should be able to use 9P (within the SSI) and therefore the client should be a simple shell script, while the server merely has to provide a 9P service accessible over the network.  And then there are the examples that are actually in the Plan9 papers: exporting your local process namespace to a compute server so that your compute-intensive process there can access all of your local resources transparently; 8½ itself.  And of course anything that deals with text on Plan9 can assume it's in UTF-8, rather than guess.  (To the extent that's not true, it's because it's trying to interact with programs beyond the boundaries of the Plan9 system.  You can't expect Plan9 to make much of a difference for how applications <i>not on Plan9</i> interact.)<p>There are any number of features that are implemented currently on Linux, but badly, that a cleaner architecture like Plan9's would support better.  x2x is one example; the ""virtual filesystems"" in GNOME and KDE, which permit you to access network servers and digital cameras and CD audio (but only in some applications) are another.  International text is a third; I don't know about you, but I'm constantly running into character-set incompatibilities.  (What do you mean, Python doesn't know what encoding my source code is in?  And why isn't naïve a valid variable name?)  Attempts like Janus and Plash and CPUShare (and Chrome! and Native Client!) to run native code in an environment without full access to your account are, I think, a fourth.",1232789328

You're in a much better position if you have several months of living expenses to painlessly tap into.<p>> Monetary policy acts against this by pushing up interest rates when it believes there is too much credit and pushing them down when there is too little.<p>Well they're certainly avoiding the whole ""pushing up"" part. If they were smoothing the cycles out in a sustainable manner, we wouldn't be talking about negative interest rates. Instead, they lower interest rates and keep them there because economic reality is politically inconvenient.<p>> In fact, more people have been lifted out of poverty under inflation targeting than under any other period of stability in history<p>How much of this can be attributed to natural technological progress rather than economic planning? And what percentage of the excess wealth (compared to an undriven economy) has been actually used to raise people out of poverty? It's not sustainable progress to get the masses out of poverty if you've used up most of the natural resources in the process.<p>> Money is created through bank loans. The banks and the government do not receive the money first. The person who borrows is the first recipient.<p>The person who borrowed is the second recipient, the bank takes the first cut through fees and increased interest. The government gets to tap into the supply through perpetual deficit spending.<p>> If the quantity and demand for money and the number of products on the market were fixed, then the decrease in the nominal price of one good would necessarily cause an increase in the nominal price of others<p>But the average (index) remains constant only if you ignore the option to save money for the future, and assume that everything earned must be immediately spent (which is precisely what were debating). When prices go down, total amount of money spent on goods should go down. This money will be saved to give one security and mobility. The price of labor should then rise, and people should be working less. Instead, the savings are eroded through inflation, and workers are kept on a constant treadmill.<p>What I really have to ask, if these central banks are really doing the optimal benevolent thing, then why do they violently shut down competition? Surely the currency they ""stabilized"" should win out in the market over possible competitors.",1232787610

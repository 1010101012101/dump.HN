There may be language equivalence classes (that would put, say, Ruby, Python and JS in the same class, C, C++ and Rust in another, and Java, C# and Go in a third), but languages from different classes can&#x27;t just be translated from one to the other. First, a program written in one language isn&#x27;t just a description of an algorithm, but a description of the algorithm plus language-specific information that&#x27;s supposed to help the particular platform execute the algorithm efficiently. Second, there are essential runtime differences that can&#x27;t be easily ported, such as a threading model and a memory model -- and those may significantly affect the suitability of an algorithm for a certain language. Finally, there are fundamental differences in the appropriateness of certain algorithms; specifically, imperative algorithms can&#x27;t be automatically translated to pure-functional algorithms without possibly changing their time and space asymptotic complexity.<p>In short, there&#x27;s a lot more to a computer program than a description of an algorithm, and even algorithms vary considerably in their suitability depending on the language/runtime executing them. Even if you could solve the first problem, you&#x27;re still left with the second.<p>I do agree with the premise, though: unless your new language/runtime is so revolutionary that it reduces development cost <i>dramatically</i>, fracturing the ecosystem is often too high a price to pay for merely a 
&quot;nice&quot; improvement. The problem is that many languages claim dramatic cost reductions, but it usually takes years to learn whether or not they deliver. The reason for that is not just the number of data points, but the fact that the cost of software is spread across a codebase&#x27;s lifetime (10 years is about the average lifespan of a production system codebase), and how development looks -- and what activities contribute to costs -- in the first and second year is very different from how it looks in the sixth.",1431501617

Here&#x27;s a small collection of what I saved/salvaged over time[1].<p>We were a small group of friends who wanted to make a Harry Potter MMO (post-trio era, if anyone cares). Well, we did make it, but we were young, didn&#x27;t know how shit about marketing and that stuff, and it never launched properly. So, the first M of MMO was never achieved, sadly[1]. I still know shit about marketing and that stuff, now that I think about it.<p>In the end there was a big (personal) argument and people divided into two groups and we parted ways on not-so-good-terms.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://nino.miletich.me/public/pixel_art/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://nino.miletich.me/public/pixel_art/</a>

9537305,comment,9530837,9530837,0,0,friendzis,,,"I am not even from USA, but this whole thing seems a bit off to me.<p>As far as I understood, one of the core goals of all these subsidies (I&#x27;m using this phrase to group all the mechanisms that change total cost of ownership, be it tax rate or whatever) were designed to keep people from being thrown out of their homes by rising taxes due to rising value and creating affordable housing. I base my comment on this.<p>First of all property prices can rise due to [fake] economic growth/housing bubbles. In that case most property values rise proportionally, therefore no change here - housing gets more expensive in general.<p>Second, property prices can rise due to area getting more attractive or just having more luxurious properties. And if you can no longer afford living there due to rising taxes - this means that you just happen to live in an area that is out of your class. Income change (e.g. loss of a job) might throw a family into a lower class. Is it unreasonable to expect to relocate? Personally I don&#x27;t think so. The same should apply to rising property costs in a neighbourhood.<p>Last, any regulation differences in the same area (housing in this case) creates non-free, regulated market and as a consequence actual prices might differ from expected &quot;natural&quot; free-market values by quite a margin or just cancel the intended effect out. For example artificially lowering construction prices in a new neighbourhood (tax exemptions; city funded utilities installation: electricity, plumbing, etc.) might create demand higher than supply effectively cancelling out the intended price reduction. Of course city planners might want to prohibit industrial buildings in some areas, but these are in no direct competition with living places.<p>I believe that the best solution is to simply have a fixed tax rate based on property value. The biggest challenge here is to calculate real market value without actually transferring ownership. The obvious choice of sell price is only valid for several years, while property can be held for decades. Valuation based on rental price is off if one can rent from wife. Yes, there are loopholes to plug and mechanisms to adjust billable property value without sudden spikes to place. The only way to make housing more available to the poor I see is to lower billable property value if it contains at least x units and maximum household income averaged over y years is less than z, legally placing tax burden on renters.",1431501308

There are fundamental differences between Haskell and Ruby, or between Java and Clojure, or between Scala and JavaScript.<p>Solutions written in these languages will look vastly different. Nobody is attempting the actor model in Haskell because the actor model is anti static typing, non-deterministic and there&#x27;s nothing FP about it. You don&#x27;t see the State or the IO monads in many other languages. Or type-classes and higher-kinded types for that matter. LISP macros are a language feature, not a runtime feature, so you can forget about interoperability. Ditto for Linq in .NET or for scala-async. ActiveRecord / ActiveModel has been a good idea for Ruby on Rails, but would be terrible in Scala. Garbage collection changes everything - for one, building immutable data-structure becomes something you can do.

To the contrary, I have no reason to believe it, and I assume we&#x27;re discussion honest interest here.<p>> Who would it be OK for an investor to date?<p>Anyone who&#x27;s not asking them an investment, which I guess still leaves plenty of options. It&#x27;s a conflict of interest issue: the entrepreneur will likely consider the possible consequences on the investment outcome of their response. I would really avoid asking someone out for a data when I&#x27;m in a position of power in their regard, as I&#x27;d prefer that whoever I&#x27;m asking out is free to decide without fear of consequences.<p>I&#x27;m not saying that nobody can ask someone out from a position of power: I&#x27;m saying that it requires a lot of extra care, as I guess it would only be ok after you get to know each other really well and there have been multiple blatant signs of interest from the other party.",1431500797

The foresight from Gehry was really taking parametrics from the Mechanical-CAD world and applying them to Architectural CAD whilst everyone else was still emulating the drawing board virtually (and unfortunately many still do), the hierarchical nature of the relationships you get from parametric modelers, and having to abstract out your physical objects, surely made the jump to storing structured information a lot more natural.<p>The real power in practice comes from the information interoperability between stakeholders, which it didn&#x27;t really touch on, but enough to highlight it&#x27;s biggest roadblock, contracts. For information into how to create a productive contractual environment you can look into Integrated Project Delivery arrangements.<p>&quot;(I don&#x27;t know a ton about this stuff, as I switched from an architecture degree to CS after a year once I realized tools like Grasshopper existed.

Are the other people working full-time while you're merely working part-time?  Generally, how much skin will they have in the game versus yours?  Are you ""Employee #1"" or really a co-founder?  In particular, are you the first of, say, 10 other employees being hired?<p>There are a lot of people here making big statements about your situation, but most of them don't seem to know what they don't know.  Why don't you give us more info so that you can get better informed feedback?",1193662434

In this case, I'd think  2% is far too low.<p>The second is where the employee isn't a founder at all.  This usually happens once the company is stable enough to be around at least for a year or two.   The job comes with a normal, market salary.  In this case 2% probably wouldn't be too objectionable - the equity is a nice perk, but really you're hired to do a job.<p>It sounds like these guys are trying to pay a category 1 salary and a category 2 equity package.  If that's the case, I'd walk.  Not only are these guys being unfair, they sound pretty clueless.<p> \n",1193661900

That way your regular users will never see an ad, but the people most likely to click on ads (external visitors in ""search mode"") will. Make sure your regulars know that this is going on though, or they may feel you are being dishonest with them.\n",1193660605

There are web businesses that rely on a strong sales team and you can actually hire an off-shore team, so the dev guy is not too important.  There are businesses that rely on a technologically superior product, and a great dev with special background knowledge.  It all really depends on what their competitive advantage is based on.<p>2% does seem to be on the low side though.  Will you indefinitely make 2%, or will you eventually make a salary?  Yet another way to look at it is comparing what you could be making at another start up, and dividing by 2% to get what should be the present value of the company.  For instance, if you could be making $50k somewhere else, then $50k/.02 = $2.5 million.  If it's just an idea, I suspect it is worth much less than $2.5 million.<p>If you really do believe in the idea, you can always ask them how they came up with the X% figure.  Do this over the phone or in person, not e-mail.  This way, you can see their real time reaction.",1193659448

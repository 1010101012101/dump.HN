6680784,comment,6671118,6672359,2,0,tmerr,,,"Albert Einstein in a letter to Jacques Hadamard:<p><i>The words or the language, as they are written or spoken, do not seem to play any role in my mechanism of thought. The psychical entities which seem to serve as elements in thought are certain signs and more or less clear images which can be &#x27;voluntarily&#x27; reproduced and combined. .... This combinatory play seems to be the essential feature in productive thought before there is any connection with logical construction in words or other kinds of signs which can be communicated to others</i><p>Good thought doesn&#x27;t have to be linguistic.<p>I speculate that the reason most of us only think in words because it&#x27;s the way we&#x27;re taught. We can <i>hear</i> the word &quot;dog&quot; because at a young age we were told about the association from each letter => sound. &quot;What does A sound like? aaaaah&quot;. But what if instead our parents and teachers taught us that A was a picture? A could be a red square, and B a purple box. &quot;DOG&quot; might be a pink triangle next to a red and a green circle. Great, then you start to remember those three shapes as one image, just as you remember the sounds &quot;duh&quot; &quot;aww&quot; &quot;guh&quot; as one. And you would learn to assemble them together in all the same ways. I bet you would get very good at it.<p>I think that every verbal system could be represented in a visual system by just replacing each sound with a shape. I actually know of people who do this, who do this fully, just not with boxes and circles. The deaf. They can learn how to read despite having no hearing. They will report that instead of using sounds they think in a combination of hand signs and images. This is the only group of people I know that replaces all sounds with images, but there are a lot of examples of in-betweens too.<p>Vladimir Nabokov, the author of Lolita:<p><i>The long &quot;a&quot; of the English alphabet has for me the tint of weathered wood, but a French &quot;a&quot; evokes polished ebony. This black group also includes hard &quot;g&quot; (vulcanized rubber) and &quot;r&quot; (a sooty rag being ripped). Oatmeal &quot;n&quot;, noodle-limp &quot;l&quot;, and the ivory-backed hand mirror of an &quot;o&quot; take care of the whites. I am puzzled by my French &quot;on&quot; which I see as the brimming tension-surface of alcohol in a small glass.</i><p>Richard Feynman:<p><i>When I see equations, I see the letters in colors  I don&#x27;t know why. As I&#x27;m talking, I see vague pictures of Bessel functions from Jahnke and Emde&#x27;s book, with light-tan j&#x27;s, slightly violet-bluish n&#x27;s, and dark brown x&#x27;s flying around. And I wonder what the hell it must look like to the students.</i><p>tl;dr you can do everything visually. Or you can mash up visuals and words. The problem of &quot;choosing between hierarchies&quot; isn&#x27;t actually a problem, because just as you can make a sound to decide, you can make a visual symbol. If this were false then you would have to explain how sign language works.",1383713874

6680780,comment,6679280,6680147,33,0,jlgreco,,,"I can think of a example of canaries working in practice (I am not sure if they were ever challenged, but they weren&#x27;t <i>successfully</i> challenged at least).  Also, the example is from the UK:<p>In the early part of the 20th century, the Automobile Association (the &quot;AA&quot;) would send &#x27;scouts&#x27; out to find speedtraps and warn motorists to slow down before arriving at them.  Within a few years cops got fed up of not catching speeders, it was decided in the courts that warning people about speedtraps was an obstruction of justice, and therefore illegal.<p>So that put an end to that game, right?  Nope.  The AA developed a new technique.  Their scouts would salute all passing cars at all times... unless something was wrong.<p>If the AA scout <i>didn&#x27;t</i> salute you, you knew there was a speedtrap.<p>The theory here was that the law could not compel an AA scout to salute motorists.  This worked for about 50 years, until the practice of warning motorists of speed traps <i>(or perhaps rather, not signaling to them an absence of speed traps...)</i> was discontinued for road safety reasons <i>(basically they decided that speeding wasn&#x27;t a brilliant idea)</i>.<p><a href=""http://www.theaa.com/aboutaa/history.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.theaa.com/aboutaa/history.html</a><p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Automobile_Association#History"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Automobile_Association#Hist...</a><p>So basically, while <i>&quot;Judges don&#x27;t take kindly to tricks&quot;</i> does make a certain amount of intuitive cynical sense, if we remove computers from the equation <i>(our intuition on morality/ethics seems inconsistent when computers are involved for some reason)</i>, does it seem reasonable that a judge might compel a free civilian in a free society to salute?  Of course not.",1383713824

6680778,comment,6679238,6679758,2,0,ericabiz,,,"I can&#x27;t speak for YC but I can speak about Techstars--I was in the first Austin Techstars class, and our Demo Day was a week ago.<p>I have had one successful tech company exit and had already raised a seed round for my current business when we decided to join Techstars. I can say this: Not only was it easily worth the 6% equity stake, but it fundamentally changed how I run a business.<p>I thought I knew what I was doing pre-Techstars, having run a tech company before and having a technical background. Heck, I have even spoken about Lean Startup at conferences! But now I look back on where I was three months ago and I am fundamentally a different person. One who now really has a shot at running a successful software startup.<p>Having checked in with several people who&#x27;ve gone through YC, they did not experience as much of a shift as I did. I think the credit goes to the unique experience of Techstars throwing you in 100+ 1:1 meetings with successful entrepreneurs in a 2-3 week period. You meet with people who have run and sold companies worth over a billion dollars. And at some point you wake up and realize, &quot;If I have to go in there <i>one more day</i> and talk to a hugely successful entrepreneur <i>again</i> and I don&#x27;t have my shit together <i>again</i> (because everyone gets ripped to shreds the first week) I am going to snap.&quot;<p>And then something kicks in inside of you and you realize you have to get it together. On the wall the days tick down to Demo Day whether you want them to or not. And the mentors tear down your ideas every day.<p>It&#x27;s that constant tear-down and the internal strength and direction it gives you that is invaluable. I can pitch my business now in my sleep and get people motivated about it. You have not perfected your pitch until you have had it ripped apart by 100 ridiculously successful people. It was one of the most painful experiences I&#x27;ve ever been through...but here I am, on the other side, and not only did I survive but I&#x27;ve discovered confidence and clarity that I never knew I had.<p>Techstars is something I&#x27;d recommend every founder experience. Again, I can&#x27;t speak for YC or any other accelerator, but I can tell you if every founder went through what I&#x27;ve just been through in the past 90 days, we wouldn&#x27;t have sad startup failure stories on the front page of HN very often.",1383713811

What were the opportunities for technology folks then? Trying settling down in Europe or US, if you can&#x27;t the next best case scenario is work at BHEL, ITI, BEL and ISRO sort of companies. The next alternative was to work at a assembly line, and next is open a small time grocery shop.<p>I see this tone repeatedly mentioned how some one&#x27;s dad had so much from ISRO at a time when India was in deep clutches of socialism. Technology imports are tightly regulated by license raj system. Any comparison between Government firms and private firms from those times is totally meaningless. Because the very concept of a good career in a non-government firm was non-existent. So its not at all strange that people working in ISRO had a good career, because frankly what exactly was there apart from the government firms.<p>We are talking of times when the Ambassador was the only car in India, a telephone connection used to take years to get, and getting a current account in a bank required police verification. And the term private firm was synonymous with a TATA owned company.<p>By these standards, ISRO is the best career option you could have in those days.<p>There is no way you can compare that with IT companies today. Not with the kind of technology infrastructure, or even working conditions, or the compensation and benefits.<p>The scenario today is the very exact opposite of 1970&#x27;s.",1383712469

That&#x27;s rather trusting of us when you think about it.<p>But we gotta. Because why? Because dynamic content supposedly; it was easier to have Turing-complete Javascript than figure out how to make HTML/CSS dynamic. Never mind that a generic VM approach should have been taken if that&#x27;s what you&#x27;re gonna do, and let random site-designer Jo(sephin)e choose the language they like hacking with rather than create yet another language that we&#x27;re all going to bitch and moan about. And you can tell that the assembler for the Web / VM approach should have been taken because that&#x27;s what Javascript is becoming. Exhibit A: ASM.js<p>And at the time we should have figured out that in addition to sandboxing we also needed a security model that would cater for end-to-end secure (anonymous?) communication. Pity we couldn&#x27;t see 20 years down the road.

6680647,comment,6679678,6680345,8,0,SwellJoe,,,"I think the danger is in the big automakers getting EV right, before Tesla reaches the middle and low end of the market. Nissan has the Leaf, which is by most accounts, a great little car. The Chevy Volt is the best-selling in my neck of the woods, it seems. Tesla makes better electric cars...as far as the reviews indicate. But, they&#x27;re also much more expensive.<p>But, here&#x27;s the reason I just placed a limit order for tomorrow morning (I&#x27;d check into TSLA a couple of times this year and thought, &quot;Nope, still trading too high.&quot;): Tesla is currently selling as many cars in a year as Chevy sells in <i>three days</i>. So, the stories I can envision in my head for how this will play out are one of the two:<p>1. Tesla will fail to scale up. They will not be able to continue executing on their business plan effective. Growth will halt. The big auto makers will gradually move into the EV market. They will use their leverage as larger players with more money to throw around to beat Tesla on the battery front and on manufacturing costs. Tesla will remain a bit player, and be bought up for patents in a few years. The stock will not do well, long term, in this scenario.<p>2. Tesla will continue to execute well, if not flawlessly as they have done up to now (let&#x27;s be honest, Tesla has an amazing record of doing the right thing at the right time). They will continue to grow at a very rapid clip. They will enter new markets. They will sell more cars than they can manufacture (and maybe more electric cars than anyone else can manufacture also, due to the current limited battery availability). They will continue to execute well on battery acquisition and development. They will continue to execute well on solving the cross-country EV trip problem...before any other manufacturer. And, they will become a major automaker. The market is <i>huge</i>. They&#x27;re less than 100th the size of Chevrolet or Ford. That&#x27;s a lot of room for growth, even with their share price being hundreds of times earnings (yes, it really is a very expensive stock, in that regard).<p>So, my primary question is: Will they execute really well. History says they will.<p>And, my next question is: Will I get other chances to buy at a discount over what it&#x27;s trading at now? I don&#x27;t know. I&#x27;ve regretted not buying stocks in the past due to it looking really expensive. I put off buying GOOG for a long time. Watched it from IPO on up to $750+. Then it went on sale for $340, and I backed up the truck as well as my stock portfolio would allow (so, I&#x27;m currently approaching a triple bagger on GOOG). TSLA is no GOOG. Probably never will be. But, it&#x27;s potentially a much larger company than it is today. I&#x27;m willing to bet a few bucks that it will be.

The current round of plugin hybrids don&#x27;t offer enough battery-only range for me.  I&#x27;d like to see about 100 mile battery only (in case I forget to plug it in), plus a small engine and 10-gallon tank.  I wouldn&#x27;t think the gas engine would have to be that large, especially if it were designed to use the battery as a buffer (i.e., it would only need to have enough HP to maintain highway speed, and acceleration could be handled by the battery).<p>Which brings up a question -- how much horse power is needed just to keep a car cruising, without accounting for acceleration?  Edit: just looked up on Wikipedia, the Model S gets 100 miles per 35kWh.  So that works out to (assuming 65 mph) about 23 kilowatts average continuous output, or 30 HP.  Considering that many car engines are 300 HP, I don&#x27;t see a 30 HP engine being that extreme.",1383710574

Growl works because its clients send messages to the Growl server on your machine when something interesting happens.<p>Web services will need to have a similar mechanism for (securely) telling your notification service that ""something happened."" Weblogs are already most of the way there: modern blogging engines can send HTTP ""pings"" when new entries are posted. Apache sends its errors to a file, so it would need to be extended to post errors to your notification service.<p>I'm rambling now, but if anyone wants to start a working group or somethin', props. It's going to need some intelligent design to take the weight of the whole internet flowing through it and to ensure that private notifications (your web server, Facebook) don't get into the wrong hands.",1241654369

As far as I am concerned, I can't afford to use PHP, because the community has a long, long, <i>long</i> history of claiming X is secure when in fact it is very, very not.

I have no reason to trust your assurances that no, no, really, <i>really</i>, it's all right this time, if you add this thing that I presume is not a core app and tweak it right and... no, thanks.

I have to say I remember those days of hitting the wall with Rails, where the learning curve goes vertical as you dig deep into the source to debug some extremely esoteric name collision or some other bug <i>that should have had a warning</i>.<p>In retrospect, it was a wall worth scaling.  I have no fear of Rails meta-programming bugs, and I've developed strategies for dealing with the thorny issues that pop up every few months.  All in all the FUD from the Java advocates has proven to be unfounded (the FUD from Haskell camp, not so much).  The effort saved by eliminating reams of boilerplate and heavy IDEs is well worth a few less-obvious exceptions.<p>As Rails has matured I think the core team has exercised restraint, and the magic situation, while an integral part of the ""Rails Way"" is at least not getting too much worse.  Plus work on Rails 3.0 is bringing real improvement to plugin-compatibility and modularity issues.  That said, I'm glad I got in on Rails early and I'm looking forward to the next big thing already.  When Rails came out it refreshingly plucked the best of 10 years of web development.  Over time, as with all technologies it is getting bloated and ultimately will gain complexity as the developer base gains experience and needs to solve a greater and greater set of problems.  Eventually someone will come along and distill all that experience into a much-simpler new framework (maybe ajax-based?  maybe continuations-based ala Seaside?) that dumps the cruft of the current ""best practices.""",1241652769

Last summer I was taking a newer smoking cessation drug named Champix. The drug works by binding with the same receptors that nicotine does, and prevents nicotine from having its effect. You take this drug while continuing to smoke, and about two weeks later, cigarettes lose their lustre. You still want the buzz, but you don't get a thing out of smoking.<p>Now here's the interesting bit. Without the buzz, cigarettes tasted gross again. I mean really gross. I didn't want anything to do with them. They smelled differently as well. Obviously I'm only relating a personal experience, and I can't say whether other people experience the same thing.<p>And to whom it may concern, I found the drug had other side effects (which may have also been related to smoking cessation), which lead to my smoking again. I lasted about two months, all in all, but throughout the entire period I was mood swinging like crazy.

Colemak may have been a better choice for certain metrics on certain keyboards, but one that cannot be stated enough for Dvorak is the way your hands alternate keys so much more than they do on QWERTY. I'm not sure if that has been studied for Colemak.<p>Thoughts on changing keyboard layouts:<p>1) If you're gonna do it, I agree with this article, touch typing = #1 priority. You're not going to see a colemak keyboard, most likely.<p>2) QWERTY actually seems to work pretty well for big thumbs on a small screen. I don't use tablets, so I don't know the state of affairs on Android or iOS keyboard layouts. This has notably not been a problem for me, even though I was initially concerned about using BlackBerrys (oh 2005 me..)<p>3) IRC/Instant Messaging are a massive way to learn how to type because you'll prioritize learning words that you type often, and natural patterns for you.<p>4) Buy a better keyboard if you're gonna go to this effort for your hands. I swear by my Kinesis Advantage Pro.<p>This process is frustratingly slow, but after ~3 weeks of going cold turkey, I have not once switched back. I was even a sysadmin for 1000's of desktops in labs, and it took 2 seconds to switch them to dvorak and back.<p>Finally, while we're at it, if your company offers ergonomic consulting, <i>DO IT</i>!

Or as a lawyer friend put it to me when we were working together on a late night at an elite NYC law firm: ""Law is only good when you can write your own ticket.""<p>All of the OP's statements are true but also not true.  For example: law is about authority, computers reject authority.  What is authority?  In some sense, it's just network effect.  A sufficient number of people have agreed on an argument, therefore it won't be disturbed unless there's a very good reason.  Same goes with computers.<p>Innovation vs. Applying past wisdom: The law's not so myopic to only look to the past.  It considers the accumulated wisdom of the past to determine what to do now.  In fact, the law is changing rapidly in part in response to technological innovation (and the increasing complexity of government and modern life).  The question is whether past rationale makes sense under current conditions.  Under that frame, innovation and disruption happens in the law  -- consider the law & economics movement, for instance, or critical legal theory.<p>The question isn't whether law or programming is inherently more innovative, it's where you're situated.<p>If you're arguing cases before the Supreme Court, you are dealing with the cutting edge of law and you are constantly looking at new cases that come out and analyzing how their rationale opens up new arguments and reflects new ways to attack existing decisions.  The problem is that to do that, you have to be the best of the best.<p>If you're a programmer at a huge corporation working on maintaining a legacy system, you probably think you have the dullest job in the world in a field where nothing changes.<p>No doubt, real differences exist between law and programming, although they are remarkably similar.  Nevertheless, I think Newport is on point when he talks about just how important excellence is to appreciating and enjoying your craft.",1352508337

For example the best home connection I can get right now is 1Mb/s down 128Kb/s up with a 12GB/mo data cap for ~35$/mo. And that's DSL, for 3G(whose coverage is spotty at best) it's a 100MB/mo cap for 10$/mo(above and beyond the 20$/mo just to have a cell phone line). My cell phone bill regularly ends up in the 80-100$ range and I don't talk that much on the phone, people who do end up closer to 150$.<p>Two, and this flows from one and the fact that salaries here are about 1/3rd of US ones with comparable cost of living; any talented people that have options will just say ""fuck this""(possibly turn over a table as they get up) and just leave. I regularly half-joke with foreigners I meet that our main export is engineers. Through college I met about 5 people who I'd consider co-founding something with. Of those 5, one is now in new york, another is at Intel, a 3rd is in france doing graduate studies and the other two left but I've lost touch with them. This even extends no non-computer fields and basically anything that requires high skill-level(so any engineering field, business consulting, finance, etc...).<p>The startup I'm working at now is actually based in the states. The founder is Lebanese-American and a mutual friend introduced us. We're trying to start something here(we're currently only 2 guys).

There are existing PGAS approaches that are similar in spirit, but they tend to invoke heavyweight MPI machinery or make assumptions about the regularity or structure of the dataset that is being distributed across the cluster.

In this case, we overload greater than operator, call the lambda function once on the client with a special object, and return an AST. This AST is then sent to the server and executed there.<p>It's rather difficult to integrate into a host language like that smoothly from the driver implementation perspective, but once the driver is written the user experience is amazing because you can write queries that look exactly like Python, but they're executed entirely on the server.",1352506144
4765360,comment,4765067,4765193,5,0,ced,,,"Macros extend the power of the language way beyond its core primitives. For instance, I wrote a macro, TEMPORARY-ASSIGN. I use it like this:<p><pre><code>  (TEMPORARY-ASSIGN ((traversing obj) true)
     ... do stuff ...)
</code></pre>
In Python, the equivalent code would be.<p><pre><code>   old_trav = obj.traversing
   obj.traversing = True
   try:
      ... do stuff...
   finally:
      obj.traversing = old_trav
</code></pre>
There's no way to abstract out that pattern in Python. Every time you want to temporarily assign a field or variable, you're stuck writing the above code. Another example:<p><pre><code>   (defun foo (x y) ...)
</code></pre>
is how you define a function in Common Lisp. I wrote a macro, DEFUN-CACHE<p><pre><code>   (defun-cache foo (x y) ...)
</code></pre>
which is the cached version. In Python, you can do the same with decorators, but that's one more tacked-on feature. Lisp programmers have been writing defun-cache since 40 years.<p>If you want to learn more, Paul Graham's On Lisp is the definitive book on the topic.

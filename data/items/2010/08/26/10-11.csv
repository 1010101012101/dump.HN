1635589,comment,1633432,1633432,0,0,d_r,,,"I am not a lawyer, but I think you're worrying about a ""maserati problem."" Many conditions need to be satisfied for this to become a concern. You'd also have to become successful and very visible. Remember that, as with any ventures, there's always a high chance that your venture will fail. Definitely do your due diligence on issues like this -- but really, focus on making your venture better and better and grow it.<p>It takes many years (say, 5) for a patent to be granted. The application won't show up on the USPTO website for at least a year. Also, it's unknown what the exact claims of their patent are at this moment. The patent may not be granted. It may even be that they filed the patent application months ago (before your idea.) It might even be that another, unknown firm, already has a patent for the same technology, although presumably this co. did their due diligence first.<p>A number of things can happen in a few years. I'm speaking completely hypothetically here, but, suppose, 6 years later their patent is actually granted. Again, it's unknown what the claims of their patent are. Even if your tech. exactly matches theirs, they may not sue. And if by that point your venture fails or is a small fry, it's a moot point. If your venture IS wildly successful and you're highly visible, you <i>could</i> see a lawsuit. But by then you're wildly successful and your efforts paid off.<p>If you're that visible, you'll presumably have significant funds for a legal defense. You might see a request for an injunction to stop producing X. You might end up settling and pay licensing fees. To me this scenario is very similar to Android: Google side-steps some potential issues when building the Android platform, Sun does not sue, Oracle acquires their IP, ""waits"" until Android is prominent, and then sues. Did this outcome (now known to us) stop Google?<p>Many big firms (say, RIM or HTC) have been sued by competitors for allegedly infringing on their patents. Did the threat of the potential future lawsuit stop them from building this tech?<p>I would consult with a patent lawyer (don't rely on HN for legal advice!) but don't spend a fortune. A lawyer will typically give you 30 minutes or so of consultation for free. In the meantime, you should be focused on building your tech.<p>Also, your website/app look great. Best of luck!",1282820234

With some highly insulated exceptions, very few people actually have anything more than a thin veneer of rituals - if that - linking them to the ""old country"". There are some genetic personality traits but even those are more often shared with other Americans than people from the ""old country"" (stubbornness, distrust of authority, tendency toward religion etc.).<p>Oversimplified, for purposes of inspecting e.g. ""work ethic"", a person is the product of the country in which they lived their formative years. A second-generation immigrant will get some heritance from their parents but at that point the effect starts wearing off.<p>As to your dissection of ""social democracy""...well.

There is no reason to suppose that your subconscious mind can't make a score of rational, and free, decisions, upon which your conscious mind gets to reflect only some time later.

I don't think you would like the work, you wouldn't learn anything, and they are not the sort of company to take the risk on you - so I can't help you there. But there is a massive lack of candidates in London at the moment, so you are probably picking a good time to come.<p>In terms of finding a position I think you've got two real options. 1. Hope that there is someone that is willing to spot your potential and train you up. I think this is a risky strategy because the majority of recruitment goes through recruitment agencies and/or HR departments - unless your CV says 2 years doing C++ development they aren't even going to look at you for C++ development. Personally I always think skills can be learnt, it is the candidates fit for the team/environment that is important - sadly a lot of people like to check boxes.<p>Your second option is to basically take the hit and try and go in as a grad - as you suggest. You wont get paid much, but you can be honest on your CV and say you got stuck in the wrong job, didn't learn new skills etc. If you get into a good company you can then start building your career. I think you'd be surprised just how much you have learnt in the past few years, coding is only a small part of a job, so you'll be miles ahead of other grads in other areas. A small step backwards can often result in a big step forwards. Obviously some companies will be hesitant as you are not a recent grad, but really they are getting more for their money because of your other experience.<p>Alternatively of course you could try your hand at your own startup (or try interning at another - depends if you can afford to live in London without a real income)!",1282818014

Surgery is a specialty. For example, I've had the head of surgical oncology at a very prestigious hospital tell me that he doesn't know much about chemotherapy -- there are other experts for that. And none of those clinical guys are necessarily experts in the <i>causes</i> of cancer, nor in its rate of incidence.<p>The stereotype, of course, is that every surgeon thinks that being a surgeon makes you an expert in everything. Sometimes that mold fits: Tremendous self-confidence is almost a requirement for being a great surgeon, and the side effect can be... an excess of confidence. And sometimes the mold is unfair. The field I briefly worked in -- antiangiogenesis -- was founded by the late Judah Folkman, a famous surgeon who did his even-more-famous research as his second job. Folkman had to spend a lot of years gathering data before other researchers were convinced that he wasn't just another surgeon with delusions of grandeur. But, as it happens, he wasn't.<p>In the end, you've got to show the data, and it has got to survive real criticism. That's the metric.",1206907180

It has however changed with the years, when I was 17 the first thing I would look at was a girls boobs, now it's more what books she's reading. So it might be related to age.",1206906709
150361,comment,150196,150260,0,0,gruseom,,,"I'm interested in your critique but it seems to me you've misrepresented two of his points.<p>#2 compares Lisp's minimalism to any language with more complicated syntax, not just C/C++. So I don't think this insight is ""common to almost all high-level languages"". (The idiosyncracies he mentions are from Ruby and Python.)<p>#3 isn't about Visual Studio's memory usage, it's about it being <i>slow</i> [1]. When I work in C#, many times a day VS is unresponsive enough to break my flow, so much so that I go off and check a website like this one (it's better than sitting there feeling angry). This is disastrous in a programming tool, so I don't think the author is being precious.<p>(There's also a deeper point to be made here, which is that the ultra-interactiveness of Lisp and Smalltalk environments is so different from what one experiences in the likes of Visual Studio that it makes a qualitative difference in one's programming.)<p>There may even be a little more to #1 than you give him. ""In Lisp it feels like types are a tool I can employ when I need it"" refers not just to static-vs-dynamic typing but also to the fact that one can easily write functions without having to make up types to hang them on (i.e. programs don't have to be organized into object models). That's not true of all high-level languges.<p>I share your desire to read more knowledgeable and useful writing on this topic. But I did like the post because it's clearly coming from real experience.<p>[1] Admittedly, much of this slowness is due to the add-in bizarrely known as Resharper. But that's Visual Studio's fault too - for being so backward and provincial that it needs a humongous third-party workaround to achieve bare tolerability even compared to Java.",1206906606

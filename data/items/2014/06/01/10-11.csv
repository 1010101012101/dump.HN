It&#x27;s interesting though that for the most part, nobody minds them redistributing loads of copyrighted material. Here&#x27;s some reasons that come to mind:<p>They web material was distributed for free in the first place. They&#x27;re redistributing ad-ware, not stuff behind a paywall. (The same can be said of some TV shows and indeed I think TV show piracy if often met with a comparatively cavalier attitude.)<p>It&#x27;s used as a measure of last resort. If I want to read an article from Wired, I&#x27;m going to try to find it on Wired -- or more likely, I&#x27;m going to Google it and get a link to Wired, and not the archive. It&#x27;s only when it&#x27;s unavailable from the original publisher or when I have specific historic interest that I end up using the web archive. The result is that publishers aren&#x27;t denied their ad revenues as long as they host their material. Your abandonware argument translates neatly to the web archiving efforts.<p>They&#x27;re archiving.

7828760,comment,7828239,7828239,27,0,goldfeld,,,"After switching from Vim to Emacs (but keeping my hardcore modal editing muscle habits through evil-mode), I realized why most hardcore Emacs users have never felt the need for this raw composability of commands and motions (which I love): hardcore Emacs users tend to be lispers, and lispers have Paredit, and that works on such a higher level of editing that you don&#x27;t need raw composability. It only works for something as homogeneous as s-expressions though.<p>There might as well be no concept of &quot;words&quot; or &quot;lines&quot; in a seasoned lisp programmer&#x27;s mind, there&#x27;s only sexps and forms. And it&#x27;s so much easier to reason that way, which is not a fault of vi&#x27;s grammar but arguably a fault of most programming languages&#x27; grammars. It&#x27;s that fabled saying that you should rather have one data structure (sexps) with 100 operations on it than 10 structures (words, lines, bracketed expressions, paras) with 10 operations each. Vi at least makes those operations consistent across structures and thus trivially deducible.<p>I tend to use vi-bindings in my Emacs coding (Clojure), but I&#x27;m more and more relying on Paredit. However I&#x27;m immensely happy to have vi commands for editing prose on Emacs, and I don&#x27;t think there&#x27;s anything more powerful than vi for that.",1401619697

His work is an attempt to construct - in Lisp - part of a system designed to counteract influencing operations via social media. The system is designed to automatically generate social media posts in natural language specifically targeted at the - civilian - persons and personalities whose sentiment is affected by the influencing operation. In itself the technology involved is fascinating and for instance relies on the inferring of personality profiles based on  samples of their writing. That said it doesn&#x27;t take a genius to figure out that such a system could easily be used for offensive purposes, i.e. unilateral propaganda.<p>What are your thoughts on participating in the development of such a system? One could consider the system to have a legitimate defensive purpose but it of course has other obvious and less benign uses. An added complication is that the targets are civilian and that foreign populations might not be the only targets considered relevant by the operator. I should add that Richard is asked about his feelings about the system during the presentation, and admits to loathing it.<p>Here https://www.fbo.gov/spg/ODA/DARPA/CMO/DARPA-BAA-11-64/listing.html is a link to a more in-depth description of the system.",1401619677

Since SQL didn&#x27;t scale properly for certain applications, new kinds of databases had to be invented. What often happened is that a software used a typical SQL database with locks, and as that didn&#x27;t scale, the locks were decreased to a point ACID wasn&#x27;t theoretically guaranteed anymore. And it worked.<p>If the database in production doesn&#x27;t guarantee consistency, you might aswell design a new database which is based on that idea, which is a core reason NoSQL databases were created.

Though a lot in both cases can be mitigated with useful remappings (use Caps Lock as Ctrl, or as Esc! Or as both! <a href=""https://github.com/alols/xcape"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/alols/xcape</a> or KeyboardRemap4Macbook). Also I find Dvorak a lot more pleasant on my fingers than good ole QWERTY.<p>I have at various different times felt a lot of strain hit some of my fingers, especially the pinkies. My right pinky complained first, and I realized how much it was used for.<p>I first switched from Dvorak to Programmer Dvorak so that my pinky wouldn&#x27;t have to do curly braces and square brackets anymore, and so that both those and parens no longer required a shift press (also helping the other pinky), since Programmer Dvorak switches numbers with symbols (the latter of which I use far more as a coder.) I also got used to Ctrl-H instead of Backspace and Ctrl-M instead of Enter, wherever I could. They didn&#x27;t work in the editor&#x27;s command mode, so I created mappings so that they would.<p>The issues went away. More recently, more than a year after that, I started feeling my other pinky, the left one. I severely reduced my Tab usage and began using the Left Alt as a Left Ctrl more, so my pinky shares Ctrl usage (which was already on Caps Lock, but still..) with my thumb. Also worked.<p>An ergonomic keyboard would also be a fine acquisition. By the way, trouble in the &quot;ulnar nerve which emanates from the neck&quot; leading to &quot;mild muscle wastage&quot; sounds quite sci-fi to me (not disbelieving, just thought it sounded rather exotic.)",1401618355

You have to experiment with it; with some foods, you really notice the taste, and it doesn&#x27;t work very well as a sweetener. But in greek yoghurt, for instance, stevia tastes really nice and not at all unlike sugar.<p>That brings me to a second point; as a vegetarian, one of my best investments was a simple reusable yoghurt strainer. Natural yoghurt has a lot of carbs in the form of lactose, but straining it into greek-style yoghurt removes these sugars, leaving protein and fat (which you can control by choosing no/low/full fat yoghurt). Add some stevia to it, and you&#x27;ve got a healty breakfast, snack, and/or dessert without any carbs.<p>I think it should also be said that relying solely on soya protein is not the best idea. It&#x27;s a complete protein, yes, but there&#x27;s very little we understand about nutrition--one of the few things we do know is that variety is better. That being said, the firmer the tofu, the fewer carbs--plus it&#x27;s easier to cook (fries up nicer). If you get sick of tofu, paneer is a good alternative, and easy to make as well.<p>Finally, chia seeds can be a useful addition. They don&#x27;t have a taste (but they absorb an incredible amount of liquid, so you can soak them overnight to make pudding), but are packed with fat, protein, and fibre (approx. 32% fat / 16% protein / 35% fibre / 7% net carb by weight).",1401617399

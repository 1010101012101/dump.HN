I believe that's because 1) in a negotiation they're better situated to play the ""bad cop"" role, and 2) the customer may be more willing to pay a premium for the assurance a professional firm ostensibly provides.<p>In contracting it's a different dynamic; the client agrees to an hourly rate and you fight the recruiter for your cut (and if you're happy with the cut then you still win).

For instance applications which keep their state permanently saved are pretty much mandatory on modern mobile devices, but very rare on desktop (Notational Velocity is one of the few apps I know which does that), yet not having to save ever would be a pretty nifty desktop UI pattern.<p>On the other hand, mobile UI patterns don't necessarily translate well indeed. There will probably be a lot of chaff, just as for a long time mobile UI suffered because developers were using desktop UI patterns on mobile devices which have not the wrong resolutions (nb: modern mobile devices have far higher resolutions than desktop machines 15 years ago) but the wrong input and output (physical size, shape, rest position, …).",1290444295

1930289,comment,1930128,1930128,0,0,DanielBMarkham,,,"I've done the recruiter thing quite a bit early on in my career, so I think I have a little to add here.<p>A good recruiter spends a bunch of time getting to know people so I can spend that same time working on my skills. They're an expert not only at making friendships, but on finding and understanding what types of jobs these people have.<p>Yes, they are motivated by get-any-deal-done. But I am motivated to take the highest price, and unlike the real-estate example, I can deal with 20 recruiters a week if I want to -- there are no exclusive locks.<p>So it's in my best interests to spread the word about my skills in an easily digestible format to as many recruiters as possible, and to make the best impression on each recruiter as they call (so they'll remember me)<p>After that it's just a numbers game. Let the recruiters fight it out over who has the best jobs, or who is able to deal with clients with really tough problems. Recruiters are tools, as much as they think they are rock stars, their job is just one of providing trust between a party with needs and a party who can provide for those needs. Personally I think the rates some of them charge should be unethical (a percentage off the top for each hour in a multiple-year relationship? Crazy) but their job is to ask for anything. Hey, it's a free country. You can ask for whatever you want, right?<p>I think, from the getting-a-job standpoint, that its just a game. Recruiters call me up and offer me all kinds of low-end, low-ball jobs. They actively try to make me take the lowest rate possible so their split can be higher. They fake parts of resumes. So what? I'm nice to all of them, only deal with the best and honest, and let the rest of them go about whatever they think of as being good business. Even with the most honorable, we haggle over rates and such. That's the way its supposed to be. That's the fun of the marketplace (although it drives many engineers nuts, I understand)<p>Now from the other side of the desk, I can see where recruiters could be a huge pain in the ass -- taking up all sorts of my time talking about positions that they are never going to fill anyway. But even then there are strategies you have to employ to be a good at your part of the game.<p>I just think ""you can't trust recruiters"" is a bit trite. You can't trust a lot of people of various walks of life. But some you can. So only work with those. Learn the game and play it well. I've had amazing relationships with recruiters. Some are really good people. They have different incentives than me, but that doesn't mean I can't trust them. I just need to understand where they are coming from.",1290443247

I want to lead the projects, I want the bigger paycheck, I want the extra responsibility; however, I want to keep coding and architecting solutions... I do NOT want to push paper around.""<p>This days the ""technical managers"" are needed less (of course there are exceptions to this rule) and less. You need a technical lead that can influence projects, make decisions based on experience, and act as a link between the developers and businessmen. Nowadays, I don't code all day as I also have some managerial responsibilities, but the bulk (say 80% ~ 90% of the time) I'm stuck in Vim pushing lines of code. I find that 10% ~ 20% of my time can be devoted to actual managing and it's more than enough.<p>Tip for the businessmen: Don't assume you need a bunch of managers to steer your project into blissful completion, you might very well get your best and most respected senior developer and ask him to act as a link between the task-force and the executives.

When asked why they're looking for a job, both state that they are not being challenged in their current position.<p>One seems to have done a lot of posting on SO, HN, and so forth during business hours. You like their posts but not that they were made during business hours.<p>They other has no record of HN or SO posts.

Maybe they took a lot of smoke breaks.<p>You <i>know</i> that one of the two did a lot of non-job stuff while being underemployed, but you also know that you like their posts. I think it's reasonable to hire them anyways, and also reasonable to pass on them.<p>But what isn't reasonable, IMO, is to give the candiate with less information a ""free pass"" by hiring them without further investigation. I would ask:<p>""You say you weren't challenged in the last job. You must have had some free time. What did you do with it?""<p>If they tell you about all the extra value-add they created for their employer, great.

I used xmlstarlet which is exactly what I need, except that xmlstarlet does not work for huge files.<p>So the question that I have is there some command-line tool, that is fast, processes XML as a stream and allows to extract elements by using a concise way (preferably XPath).<p>I just cannot believe that after more than 10 years of XML there are no reliable tools around - I would actually expect that such tools will find their way in the UNIX standard.<p>Noet 1: Please don't blame me for using huge XML files, it's not my design decision - the reality is that there are cases where we have to work with huge XML files. I know all the inconvenience of XML and I know that the overhead is very huge, but that is not the point here.<p>Note 2: Please don't tell me that I should use programming language X or Z to read XML.

Don't fall for it.'<p>I am not on facebook now but I was registered there with my email. Sometime back I got a facebook invitation from a new friend and the invitation mail had links to facebook profiles of three others friends. The only way to trace these relationships was my email. I wondered how did they do that. Checking my email against contact lists of all the facebook users?",1290441925

Sure we have some good clues to go on but outside of Google's own info (which on at least one occassion I've considered to be a deliberate attempt to mislead, though I might be wrong) or industrial espionage the only way to determine the nature of the algo is to experiment (or use other's experiments).<p>Yes they have a heavy reliance on site authority and the external link structure but this is not all there is.<p>Good content is arguably what Google wants because it is how they mine their product (people) to be delivered to their customers. Whether their algo is optimised to deliver good content is a separate issue - you clearly think not.<p>Haven't you been stung with any of the algo updates?",1290441892

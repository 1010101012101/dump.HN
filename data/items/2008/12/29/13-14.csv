412999,comment,412755,412793,0,0,ralph,,,"Separate from the collective mind of Americans is the status of the US Dollar as a ""reserve currency"", i.e. one that people are happy to hold in times of trouble.  If that goes then, given the USA is bankrupt, it'll be in trouble.  It's only because it's a reserve currency that the USA can afford to chuck bills from helicopters;  elsewhere, doing that has caused the currency to fall dramatically, e.g. that idiot Gordon Brown in the UK.<p>China holds quite a few dollars and is wary of the USA's plans on trying to spend its way out of this recession in case their value slumps.  There's an argument that all these rescue plans are just prolonging the inevitable, just as the boom was stretched by Greenspan's actions making it a huge bust to mirror the huge boom.  What's needed is a hard crash in asset prices, houses, stocks, commodities, etc., until buyers are convinced that a hard bottom has been found.  Then they'll be interested in buying again.  And companies going to the wall in that time is a good thing;  it culls the weak.  <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creative_destruction"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creative_destruction</a><p>There's still worried talk of deflation.  I think they're over concerned.  There's some things I must buy, even if they're a bit cheaper tomorrow, e.g. food, and if my TV breaks, I'll replace it.  By over-compensating for fear of deflation, we're facing high double-digit inflation in a year or so.<p>Reminds me of that old matra:  For deflation, hold cash.  For inflation, hold gold.  For hyper-inflation, hold guns.",1230558732

Every mac I've had has died (basically my last 4 computers). 2 screen deaths, one overheat, and one coffee incident.<p>I blame all of these on myself. Even paying 3k for a top of the line laptop, I really dont expect the computer to last more than 1.5 years at the way I use the computer. Pounding away on the computer for 60 hours a week on average, and working out of lots of coffee shops, I'm hardly the typical use case for a computer user.<p>Just like a consumer coffee machine cant be expected to stay functional for long if it were in use in a restaurant, I dont expect my consumer laptop to work for the same time period as an average consumer would.<p>However, if you're using a laptop for commercial purposes, and at such a high capacity, you should probably expect to be investing at least yearly in your equipment.",1230557386

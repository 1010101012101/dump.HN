It's interesting to see all the different ways that this is being done by different apps and services.<p>When I came up with Remembary in 2010, I thought I was the first to mix diary-writing and all these public feeds - and then I discovered that Momento had been doing a similar thing for almost a year beforehand. I feel like there's been a lot more of these kinds of apps and services popping up lately.<p>I like the Annual Reports idea - I'd be interested to see what gets tracked and how it's analyzed. It's also a great monetization strategy, although I know from experience that print fulfillment and shipping can be a headache!<p>Also, their ""Blast From The Past"" feature highlights one of the less-known benefits of keeping a journal: seeing what you were doing in the past and comparing it to what you're doing now - and thus getting perspective on both the past and the present. I have about six years of handwritten diaries, and I'll often go through them and check the same day in each one. The new version of Remembary (just finished QA testing - should be in the App Store in a few weeks) has ""1 Year Earlier"" and ""1 Year Later"" buttons just for this kind of thing.<p>Congratulations on a cool looking app. Trust me when I say I know how difficult it can be to make something that seems to simple.",1344045587
4337172,comment,4337069,4337069,19,0,nirvana,,,"People have been saying that Apple was going down, in my experience, since 1981 with the introduction of the IBM PC.<p>Seriously, in the 1980s it was IBM, Commodore, Tandy, et al.  In the 1990s it was Windows.  In the past decade every two-bit media player was called an iPod killer. Every phone ripping off the iPhone is called an iPhone killer.  Every tablet is called an iPad killer.<p>And of course the myth has been spread that anything Apple does well is just the result of Steve Jobs.<p>Just as everyone who buys Apple products does so because they come under Steve Jobs ""reality distortion field"".<p>And how everything Apple has been doing in the past 5 years was poor because Steve Jobs health was bad.<p>How about that the iPod sucked becuase it didn't have an FM tuner?<p>Or the iPhone is never going to fly without a physical keyboard.<p>Or the iPad sounds like a woman's product and nobody will buy it, and of course nobody will carry it around.<p>Etc. Etc. Etc.<p>Apple is failing, always has been, and always will be.<p>Every time the stock goes down $30 (equivalent to a $60 stock going down $3) the stock is crashing.<p>When Apple misses wall street expectations by a few cents (but beats their projections) its a sign that the stock is in decline - before Steve Jobs died it was just proof that Apple sucked.  When he was sick, it was because he lost control.  Now that he's dead, Apple will never be able to accomplish anything good.<p>It has been 30 years of this crap.",1344045586

PeopleSoft's ""SA"" module that UCF is using for registration <i>includes a waitlist feature</i> that already does all of this -- actually, it's better, because it just pops people off the stack when a spot becomes available.<p>So, let's be clear:<p>- UCF willfully refuses to enable the waitlist option in PS<p>- Student uses a public interface to replicate the functionality<p>- Star chamber declares the student broke a nebulous IT policy and that he has to write humiliating 'research papers' as contrition.<p>And people wonder why higher ed is less and less valued...",1344045339

I understand that charging for the service is the reason they have officially decided to keep it blocked.<p>Unless he has misrepresented the facts about how much data his service pulls it is trivial compared to daily use of the university service. He has invested significant time and money into creating a much more user-friendly interface to the course catalog. That is worth the amount he was charging. The problem, of course, is that he does not own the course listing, and the university has every right to offer it on their terms.<p>Better to ask forgiveness than permission the saying goes, but in this case it seems forgiveness is not forthcoming. Based on the free garage spot counting app he mentions in the presentation it looks like permission would not have been granted either. So while the university is within their rights, they do seem to be contradicting their own value statements.",1344045208

I can think of good arguments to object to a private service charging students for access to classes; it puts students who can't afford ""YouCanFinish"" at a disadvantage in class registration and (if competition emerges) there's a huge incentive to intentionally lag the registration servers so that students effectively have to use the private service to get classes.<p>Seems like the sort of service where the right path is to work with the school, not try to privately monetize class selection.",1344045111

I spent less than a minute thinking of a better solution (IMHO) and that is:<p>You have a webcam on your desk (or remote hot vid mini desk spots) and you are permanatly logged into that.  This allows the remote worker to be apart of the office and also for people to walk up and speak to them, allowing the remote worker to be seen as well as see who is approaching, instead of wam bam in your face.  This also affords people to see when they are busy or not.   To me this approach is better.  But this and also assumes the remote worker has the bandwith to accomodate this and there not on some 3g/28.8 connection due to there location and for alot that is why they are remote working anyhow.  Rememebr remote working also covers workers in different locations.  I and many others I can garantee have worked in companies with more than one office in more than one location and none of them have an issue and  tend to still use bridged conference calls or phone calls.

The HTC One X was an incredible phone but they went with a non-removable battery that significantly held it back compared to the Galaxy S3. The locked bootloader on the ATT One X was just too bad. And for all their touting of the camera, the Galaxy S3 has the better one. The silly decision to implement aggressive process killing was just stupid. And for some people, no sdcard option didn't cut it.<p>And no these aren't just features geeks would want, even if they are, geeks influence buying decisions of a lot of people. So they're definitely important. Especially at a time when HTC wants to build up a strong brand with their One series.

It sounds like a great company.<p>His insight about corporations being Soviet in nature is spot-on. Corporatism is neither capitalism nor socialism, but a hybrid system to give a well-connected elite (~0.5%) the best of both systems and the other 99.5% the worst of both worlds. Look at air travel; that's about as Soviet an experience as one gets, but the pricing is aggressively and mean-spiritedly capitalistic. Or consider suburbia as a microcosm. The rich live in places like the Hamptons and have both rural and urban amenities, while the poor live in depressed, polluted exurbs that combine the worst of city and country life.<p>What Valve sounds like to me is a post-scarcity capitalistic model where there's still inequality of results (as, IMO, there should be) but there isn't pain or poverty.<p>In our current world where there is a lot of scarcity (even though it's outmoded and artificial in the US) people work a certain way, and give up too much power, because the alternative is risk of economic misery. In a post-scarcity world with more of a safety net, people probably would ""wheel their desks"" to other projects, companies, and opportunities (or split their time among more than one, rather than lingering in this undiversified full-time thing) more freely. That's what we're starting to see in technology, as the demand for programmers increases and the stigma against changing jobs frequently (assuming there's upward progress and learning) goes away.",1344042473

The capsule would then coast through the atmosphere until it slowed down then deploy its parachutes when it had slowed down enough and float to the surface.<p>Here's one abort mode for the space Shuttle: the Shuttle continues to fly until the SRBs have burned out (there's little choice about that) and jettisoned, then the orbiter rotates 180 degrees so that it is thrusting against its direction of travel, the SSMEs continue to run until the forward momentum is cancelled and the vehicle is headed back toward the launch site, then the SSMEs are shut down and the ET jettisoned, the orbiter then glides to an unpowered landing at the KSC landing strip.<p>Or, how about this one: if the Shuttle's SSMEs cut out during flight then the orbiter rides along until the SRBs burn out, then they and the ET are jettisoned, the orbiter glides a bit until it slows down, then a hatch is opened and a rail is extended out of the hatch, the crew then individually bail out of the vehicle as it is traveling several hundred mph by sliding along the rail (which allows them to avoid hitting the wing) and deploy their individual parachutes, they land in the ocean and are recovered by a search-and-rescue team.<p>That's complicated, the Dragon/Falcon is utter simplicity.",1344042259

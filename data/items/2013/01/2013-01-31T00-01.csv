5142746,comment,5141900,5142428,0,0,JoeAltmaier,,,"You say novels have deeply impressed you - at a conscious level, with moving themes and new ideas.  Despite violence, evil characters and events, maybe even genocide. They all happen in novels.<p>Compare a video game - you kill an NPC, scoop up some loot, scrounge around breaking all their crates and pots, then move on.  Not thinking about it, not caring what it is you're doing or what it means to loot a body or take the pathetic remains of some poor wretch's miserable existance. Ha!  This gun is way worse than the one I'm wielding! Throw it in the trash, or keep it to sell for coin.<p>Clearly they are very different experiences. You can't tell me killing innocent bystanders, looting strangers' homes, fencing stolen goods not once but 10,000 times to get to the final level - none of this penetrates, not even a little? You mention Doom which is disengenious - that was riveting when it came out because of the tension, the surprises. But we're way past that now. Now we hear the screams of carefully simulated civilians, see their blood, then loot their wallets and cars.<p>Why?  What moron thinks this is entertainment? It substitutes shock for any scrap of intelligent gameplay, until it becomes meaningless.  Until its just abstract gameplay.<p>Anyway maybe I'm off the mark here. But until we admit that something is going on here that's different from a book or movie, we've not begun to figure out whether it matters.",1359593980

The fact that we need more and more sophisticated testing techniques is because we understand more about the intricacies of human body and the ways it can interfere with treatment process. Placebo is an obvious example of such interference.<p>To me, calling a scrupulous testing process a factor that's retarding scientific progress is like saying QA is retarding software progress.",1359593961

5142731,comment,5141900,5142646,5,0,btilly,,,"For your information I grew up in Canada.  A long time ago I would have immediately agreed with you.<p>But then I made the mistake of posting my views on Usenet.  Unlike most people on either side of these arguments, I actually followed up on the deluge of references I got in return from both sides.  And did my best to create an informed opinion for myself.  Here are some basic points off of the top of my head from what I have learned over the following two decades.<p>- Gun ownership and gun violence are nothing like linearly correlated.  For example Canada has a third the guns/capita that the USA does, and a fifth the gun violence.<p>- The USA's violence problems are tied closely to racial problems.  Over half of homicides are committed by blacks, and over half of the remainder by hispanics, despite the fact that there are more whites than either of those other racial groups.  I just ran across a reference that I'm not sure is trustworthy indicating the the homicide rate among US whites is actually 0.32 per 100,000.  If true then that is down with Singapore and Iceland - and is under half of most European countries.<p>- When two areas have easy transport between them, the one with more restrictive gun rules tends to experience worse gun problems tied to crime.<p>- There is some evidence that removing guns increases levels of violent crime, but reduces odds of death during that crime.  Whether you consider this an improvement is likely to depend on your politics.<p>- I've seen and found believable (but have not researched) the claim that in the short term after a major gun ban, the use of guns in crime actually goes up.  (It is believable because criminals still have their guns, and have less fear about using them.)<p>- No matter what the truth is, there is no way in the US system that we actually could ban guns.  It would require changing the Constitution in a way that most Americans do not like.",1359593621

5142729,comment,5141900,5142278,4,0,cookiecaper,,,"It's about the typical reaction to each image. A normal person will repulse from depictions of gore and violence because most people are not naturally inclined to that kind of imagery, so it's less important to regulate because its effect on the vast majority of the viewership is not dangerous, though contributing to the desensitization toward violence and crime is obviously counterproductive and individuals should take care to control their personal intake.<p>Pornographic or erotic imagery is different. It taps into a natural impulse that almost every person has and most likely doesn't promote particularly virtuous deployments of that inclination. Sex, and by extension sexual imagery, has a very powerful pull on most people and the use of sexual impulses must be tightly controlled if reasonable social cohesion is to be maintained.<p>Will and Ariel Durant, prominent historians from the mid-1900s: ""No man, however brilliant or well-informed, can dismiss the wisdom of the laboratory of history. A youth boiling with hormones will wonder why he should not give full freedom to his sexual desires; if he is unchecked by custom, morals, or laws, he may ruin his life before he understand that sex is a river of fire that must be banked and cooled by a hundred restraints if it is not to consume in chaos both the individual and the group.""<p>I find that description extremely apt. Sexual imagery provokes a more fervent reaction because it has a much more dangerous effect on a much wider segment of the populace than violent imagery.",1359593565

Probably because to kill someone in those countries is a much more strenous physical task, so you can say ""fuck you"" as many times as you want to your neighbor without risking to have a bullet in your leg. Chicks impressed and nobody was killed... perfect civilised way to solve a small problem about property boundaries.<p>f-words in those countries can express humour, angry, frustration, irony, and even a sense of victory over the evil code when you solve a bug. We try to avoid profanity in presence of childrens of course, but not a lot of childrens are expected to jump to read source code, so... adult territory, sorry boy.<p>And finally, profanity can be very useful. If you need to put a landmark you need to find a rare word, short, not commonly used as name of a variable, nor a reserved word or one that another script will put automatically in your file.

The difference that the author articulates is the difference between two major schools of thought in this field: Behaviorism and Constructivism.<p>The hand-holding, specifications approach taken by American College Board is an example of Behaviorism.  While Project Euler's structured, incremental challenges are examples of Constructivism.<p>Within IT, there are certainly adamant followers of both schools of thought.

I don't really see Europe as having many solutions, though, except that I do like the European economic and social-safety model better. Europe does not do well at all with violence except in pretty narrow cases: monocultural to the point of being pretty racist nation-states, with a sort of extended-family village mentality. Once you try to have any kind of diversity in Europe, people get shot, even if the differences are pretty minor! Northern Ireland, the Balkans, the French <i>banlieues</i>, anywhere with mixtures of populations and cultures and you've got trouble. I live in Denmark currently, and it has low overall violence, but seems to basically consider multiculturalism the root of all evil, and everyone assimilating to fit within a narrow range of acceptable Danishness as the #1 strategy to keep everyone from harming their neighbor. Seems like a pretty depressing approach to peacefulness.<p>And on the high-profile mass-shooting cases, there's little difference at all: Europe has its Utyas and Erfurts, too.

So a lot of this is news to me. Also maybe some of the posted 'improved versions' provide what I'd like with this 'contenteditable' thing. It'll take a while to try them all.<p>Anyway...<p>So far I don't see one crucial feature: the ability to load an existing file, and edit it. Am I stupidly missing something 'obvious'?<p>Being able to edit text and save, but not load existing documents and edit them makes this a useless novelty.<p>I did notice one suggestion to load a doc then use a short js command to switch to contenteditable. But that's not quite there.<p>Ideally, a browser could be made to work like this:<p>* Multiple ways to get it started: bookmark, desktop shortcut icon, url to public or private html page containing the config script. Once working like an editor it should stay that way, for multiple file load/saves and multiple tabs open.<p>* An 'open file' for any existing plaintext or html file, loaded from local filesystem (via file selector popup or bookmark) or the web (type known url or use bookmark).<p>* Ability to switch back and forth between three modes on the same document: raw plain ascii (no formatting), minimal formatting (B, I, U, bullets), and full html formated display.<p>* A document 'save as' as plain text (formatting stripped) or html, to the local filesystem, OR (best feature yet) anywhere with write enabled on a public or private web server.<p>* Nice if also handles encrypted load/save, so the doc is never in plaintext except on the local machine.<p>With that, the big name 'cloud' services can go take a leap. I could use my own server(s), or ones I happened to trust. There is flatly no way I would ever trust large enterprise cloud services.<p>Also, a tool like that which would allow editing on ANY machine with web access and local file r/w enabled for the browser, would be very useful for... things.<p>It always astonished me that browsers did not provide the capability to natively edit the html they displayed. Such an obvious need, and you'd think so simple to implement, that I'd concluded the absence of this ability had to be a deliberate industry-wide agreed policy of capability avoidance.

Mainly because apps (then) were limited to a 16MB heap and bitmaps would allocate memory automatically but need to ""reminded"" to release it afterwards. The only real way to know if you'd exceeded the limit when you tried to open a bitmap was to catch the OutOfMemory exception and retry with a lower sampling of the image. So the simple act of trying to read an image into memory and display it turns into a complex memory management scenario.  Good times.",1359590627

Hong Kong knock off backstreet copies of Applesoft and BASIC manuals.  That and those old home-computer magazines with program listings in that you could type in and make a lunar lander game etc.<p>Programming wasn't available at school so my next chance to get my feet wet was on my final year Physics degree project.  With a few math projects in FORTRAN along the way :-/<p>So given that my skillset was pretty much BASIC only at this point I took one look at C in 1995 as I graduated and balked.  Pointers?  WTF?  I am never doing that ever.  Programming ain't for me.  Just not that smart I guess.<p>In reality I did a lot of early web programming, I just never thought of HTML and very early javascript as being programming.  I'd build the occasional page or two myself with HTML JS CSS in the intervening years.<p>But it wasn't till 2010 and I was having technical co-founder issues for the second time in back-to-back startups (not his fault, visa issues with a family member), when I realized I needed to be my own technical co-founder.<p>Ruby!  WTF?  Nothing like that old C that scared me away.  I can do this!  Thanks to Ruby-on-Rails, Stack Overflow, a ton of great web blogs and Hacker News here I am a few years later able to get paid for programming for other people while I build my own MVP and first iteration of product for my own startup.

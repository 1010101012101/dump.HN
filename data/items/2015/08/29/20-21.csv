It dates back to March, so it&#x27;s conceivable that it&#x27;s been modified or superseded since then; I haven&#x27;t been able to find anything to indicate so, but I&#x27;d be happy to be wrong.<p>Basically, there seems to be a lot of confusion stemming from blogs that heard about the document that I posted, but only linked to the document that thejosh posted. I found this doc via the CNXSoft post that appeared on HN yesterday [1], which mentioned the &quot;protected from flashing&quot; line and linked to Etherpad notes from a presentation, which linked to the U-NII Device Security v01r02 document that I posted above. It&#x27;s kind of a ridiculous chain, so I can see why people were confused. You&#x27;re right that none of the documents directly linked in this thread talk about blocking custom firmware; when people are talking about that, they&#x27;re thinking of the U-NII Device Security document, not the &quot;Equipment Authorization and Electronic Labeling for Wireless Devices&quot; proposed rule.<p>> <i>Is this a case of some documents describing preliminary consultations and others a final situation that differed from what was contemplated originally?</i><p>Possibly. They may also be describing different aspects of the FCC&#x27;s evolving wireless policy. I haven&#x27;t followed the rabbit hole deeply enough to determine for sure whether the FCC is still currently on track to block custom firmware, but it appears that they were as recently as March.<p>> <i>For that matter, is it actually the case that some routers don&#x27;t fully isolate the radio control software as intended by the regulations, in which case installing custom firmware like DD-WRT or OpenWRT really would be a risk</i><p>Oh, yes, certainly. Most of these firmwares are designed to be useful for users all over the world; IIRC, the one I use (Tomato) lets you select your region from a pull-down, and then enables the channels appropriate to your claimed region. (You can achieve the same thing by downloading the manufacturer&#x27;s firmware intended for a different region; custom firmware is not required.)<p>I think this was well-meant on their part, but I agree that it is a problem, and it makes sense for new routers to block access to block access to unauthorized channels on a level that custom firmware can&#x27;t touch. I just think that blocking custom firmware entirely is throwing the baby out with the bathwater.<p>[1] <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=10137470"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=10137470</a>",1440881919

As Dr. Dre says in the linked article...the choruses are mostly him scratching the record. At the same time, the lyrics are so unapologetically violent and degrading towards women, that it influenced literally every major rap record that came after.

10141326,comment,10139679,10141167,0,0,Sanddancer,,,"The rules do nothing of the sort. The guidelines state that the hardware manufacturer must make certain that reasonable efforts have been made to keep the device from trampling over radar systems, etc. The guidelines state that one route to do so is to have the firmware locked down in its entirety, but there are other ways to do so. Atheros chips, for example, do not expose the functionality that would require the chips to be locked down. Wireless researchers will almost certainly have the licensing in place to do investigation and modification. Device makers choosing not to update their devices should honestly be handled through tort; a few lawsuits against companies making defective routers will get makers to shape up. Buggy devices can and should be handled similarly. Finally, with your point regarding secure wifi vendors and the like, those would be the manufacturers and would by definition have access to all of those settings.<p>This campaign reminds a lot of the bad old days of Microsoft and spreading Fear, Uncertainty, and Doubt. This is not an evil policy that has nefarious purposes, it&#x27;s about making sure people don&#x27;t intentionally use their devices that will cause damage to the neighbors on the bandwidth spectrum. Also, keep in mind that the unlicensed regions were not created for communications, but rather so that medical and industrial heating devices have some range of frequencies to operate magnetrons, etc, without disrupting sensitive communications. Wifi uses them mostly because they do go unused the majority of the time.",1440881814

Use a heat map of where people usually look on screens as a basis for where the first things to be seen should go, and what needs to be on the screen at the same time.  Use information about color and contrast psychology to select colors and decide how to emphasize images.

Without data, mathematics is completely hollow. Skip this step, and it&#x27;s all constrained fiction, but fiction nevertheless.<p>Comparatively speaking, English is an extremely logical language and it does enforce a level of active reasoning on the speaker[0]. Combined with the emphasis on individuality and the value of self, both being highly western values, we have ample examples of what John calls the bastardization of reason and aggressive common sense. It&#x27;s everywhere... politics, pseudo-science, non-science, and even simple everyday conversations are full of reasons that actually are immaterial, which makes them illusionary, but that are encouraged by the culture and the language we use to express ourselves. Worse yet, feeding off our obsession and trust of science (and in many cases celebrity), communicators repeatedly abuse reason to accomplish their motives, be it commercial or personal. Donald Trump exemplifies the bastardization of reason and aggressive common sense. He&#x27;s betting his campaign on it, and it&#x27;s working because these observations of western culture are true.<p>Beyond that point, regarding &quot;6 qualities&quot; John is easier to challenge on the merits. But if one subscribes to scientific models instead of axioms [1], then it is but another model which is worth analysis and pursuing for all of it&#x27;s bases and applications. In terms of the physics of this, the other elements (common sense, creativity, ethics, intuition, memory) would be the input (hopefully evidence but not to be confused) and reasoning would be the logic (hopefully mathematically accurate but not to be without checks and balances).<p>Anecdotally, as evidence of hollow reasons there is the <i>excuse</i>. We are all trained to make good excuses growing up, but what are they really? They are simple statements used to shift blame, and are backed first and foremost by a motive (not science). Hence the smarter we are the more excuses we can generate, and the better they will be. Most of them may even be true. But the point is, given the circumstances and our intelligence, we can pretty much reason ourselves and others to think anything when trusted. When we start twisting the facts and deceiving even ourselves, we have confabulation, and this too is a real and serious problem [2].<p>--<p>[0] Wish I had a quick reference, but by being the Lingua Franca of science English has been pushed to be easier to reason with. Japanese for example, does not have plurals and no subject-object distinction. It is harder to do math and science when the language doesn&#x27;t care how many or what is objective.<p>[1] &quot;The semantic view of theories, which identifies scientific theories with models rather than propositions, has replaced the received view as the dominant position in theory formulation in the philosophy of science.&quot; ( <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_theory#About_theories"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_theory#About_theori...</a> )<p>[2] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confabulation"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confabulation</a>",1440880464

What&#x27;s your experience with Erlang as a &quot;day to day&quot; language for more mundane stuff?<p>For example, a lot of my work tends to revolve around working with data. Processing large batches of data, parsing (often it comes in the shape of XML), transforming, filtering, ingesting it into databases, and so on. I can do this easily in Ruby, but performance issues has driven me to use Node.js or Go for new projects. With Go it&#x27;s ridiculously easy to build efficient pipes that can parallelize each step to my liking, backpressure included. It&#x27;s also trivial to build small command-line tools as well as specialized daemons. I have a world of libraries (and bindings to C libraries) at my disposal: AWS, image processing, transcoding, PostgreSQL, XML, JSON, it&#x27;s all there. Go is also decent at Unicode and string manipulation.<p>I&#x27;m not wild about Go&#x27;s performance, and everything I have seen of Erlang indicates that its performance is closer to that of Ruby or Node.js. Any comments here? Whenever I need to fire up anything related to batch processing in Ruby or Node.js, things take forever. Erlang&#x27;s advantage here might be that it&#x27;s easier to spawn remote processes to parallelize the workload.",1440879364

In the tech sector if you can&#x27;t effectively monetize the work you do then the attitude is very much &quot;well do something else then&quot;, but for some reason media people seem to think that when they cannot monetize their work it is the fault of the consumer, not themselves.

The answer to your last question can be found there; I copied it below :)<p>-----------<p>Q. “Are these words real or do you make them up?” \n      –silhouetteme<p>Both. They’re real words, that are made up by me. I use the standard of realness established by lexicographer Erin McKean:<p>“People say to me, ‘How do I know if a word is real?’ You know, anybody who’s read a children’s book knows that love makes things real. If you love a word, use it. That makes it real. Being in the dictionary is an arbitrary distinction; it doesn’t make a word any more real than any other way. If you love a word, it becomes real.”",1440878765

The team is the same team behind noflojs.org, so they do have some credibility.<p>But there is a misconception about Artificial Intelligence in general and its kind of true that the term is being overused. Putting couple of If/Else statement nowadays or using a Machine Learning library (Say, to find a good colour contrast - <a href=""http://harthur.github.io/brain/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://harthur.github.io/brain/</a>), developers claim they are using machine intelligence and the general public might get a notion that they are doing some high-end research, while in principle they might be using one or two generally available library that any developer can use with 5-10 minutes of learning..

Right now with $100 of equipment you can get around the signature checks as its just being done in firmware. In the future you won&#x27;t be able to because companies will (likely) have to adopt tougher and tougher measures including tech from Intel and others. Intel designed its tech to be licensed out to others not in the X86 world. That effectively locked down Intel hardware already and no recent generation hardware can be completely free&#x27;d. LibreBoot is a 100% free BIOS that only works on older laptops because the lead developer can&#x27;t port it to newer hardware due to locks that can&#x27;t be overridden. The signature checks are done in hardware and you can&#x27;t even just wipe out the firmware. No firmware means check fails means system doesn&#x27;t turn on.",1440878442

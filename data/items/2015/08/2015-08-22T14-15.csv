Yes, the lowest of big cities. San diego has a population of a little over a million, quite comparable to Amsterdam (which has a smaller population, but roughly a million).<p>And what&#x27;s the murder rate in 2014? 32. Amsterdam&#x27;s murder rate in 2014? 20.<p>Alright so, the safest big city in the US, has a murder rate comparable with the most dangerous city in the Netherlands, or as you call it the murder capital of Europe.<p>(2) Yes I did refute your claims. Are you not listening?<p>1) Again, the 4.4 number includes abortions, dangerous driving and euthanasia. You can make a claim for dangerous driving (although it&#x27;s mostly self-murder, so doesn&#x27;t impact my safety), but euthanasia and abortion doesn&#x27;t affect my safety AT ALL or anyone else&#x27;s. Virtually every year the actual murder rate in Amsterdam is below 2, again comparable to the SAFEST city in the US, and this is supposedly the most dangerous city. So someone aborts a baby, or a 95 year old with a great life who went blind, bed ridden and in constant pain from a chronic disease wants to die and is requests euthanasia, makes my life less safe? It&#x27;s a joke.<p>2) And those are murder rates of who? Organised crime. 90% of the murders in Amsterdam are assassinations of organised criminals, people who generated +$100m in drug money and get assassinated by a competitor. It has absolutely NOTHING to do with my safety. It doesn&#x27;t affect me at all. Drug crime isn&#x27;t like it is in the US, every month or so one or two people get assassinated in a targeted attack. I&#x27;ve never witnessed this or heard the gunshots or seen the blood or the bodies, despite living my entire childhood in neighborhoods in Amsterdam where this happened. (the richest neighbourhood by the way because these drug lords are all multi millionaires who live in expensive villas. The fact someone goes to their home and kills them and spikes the murder rate affects ordinary people in no way whatsoever. As opposed to gang violence in the US which takes the lives of many innocent people, and takes the lives of young small time petty criminals who have few opportunities, as opposed to 50 year old millionaires who&#x27;ve been in crime for decades). It&#x27;s like saying if a police officer kills a dangerous criminal and the murder rate goes up by 1, that this makes your life less safe, it&#x27;s a joke.<p>3) Actual crime (whether it&#x27;s assault, rape, theft) is all much lower because Amsterdam is extremely safe and the murder rate is only high because virtually all victims are high level criminals. If you actually look at safety (whether it&#x27;s from murder or any other crime) for ordinary civilians, it&#x27;s nowhere near the safest US city. The comparison is a total joke.",1440255023

My point is that this is unavoidable under capitalism.<p><pre><code>  Capitalism => private ownership of production
             => operation for profit
             => charging for services
             => only get what you pay for
             => classist, elitist society
                  (according to kafkaesque[1])

This may not be limited to capitalism, but it is an unavoidable consequence of it.<p>[0] <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=10100170"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=10100170</a><p>[1] <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=kafkaesque"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=kafkaesque</a>",1440253720

In C, automatic imports and the like, I do not even wish for (since it is so necessary for me to completely understand the function calls I make, I need to read the docs quite commonly which mention the header for #inclusion). And, for Haskell, I&#x27;m constantly prototyping in ghci, so I learn what I need anyway. In neithr of these languages do I feel it is helpful enough for me to desire such things. Having said that, I understand that many people disagree; not too long ago, there was a small uproar that Haskell did not have a proper IDE yet. And I am exposed to IDEs at $DAYJOB, but if anything, that has further soured me towards them.<p>To all their own, text editors and IDEs alike; I think I&#x27;m likely to stick to my text editor :)<p>[1] <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5169638/autocompletion-in-vim"" rel=""nofollow"">https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5169638/autocompletion-i...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=325"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=325</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=213"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=213</a>",1440252711

It&#x27;s got a high murder rate because it&#x27;s a capital for drug lords and assassinations happen. Civilians are completely unaffected by this. In my neighbourhood multiple people were assassinated while I was a kid, nobody ever talked about it, nobody was scared or anything, it&#x27;s a non-topic really. In fact most of them used to happen in the wealthiest part of Amsterdam where all the rich people live and where I&#x27;d happily and safely cycle to school by myself at age 8 every day.<p>One of the streets where an assassination happened and where I&#x27;d cycle daily was this one: <a href=""http://www.studiokoning.nl/Foto_Amsterdam_2/Apollolaan_14042009_8004.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.studiokoning.nl/Foto_Amsterdam_2/Apollolaan_14042...</a><p>Again this is a street where virtually everyone living is a millionaire, and the primary school she&#x27;s 1 minute away from is one of the best in the country.<p>Nobody I knew ever witnessed anything, you&#x27;d just read it in the newspapers. The people who got assassinated were high level drug bosses who&#x27;d been in organised crime for decades. We&#x27;re not talking about civilians here.<p>Beyond that, these are eurostat numbers and they&#x27;re a bit shitty. The murder rates include <i>drumroll</i> abortion, dangerous driving and euthanasia. In short, it has nothing to do with crime or safety. So even the homicide rate of the Netherlands (a mere < 1 per 100k) is overstated. (as it probably is for American cities which have high abortion rates due to socioeconomic issues and poor sex ed)<p>Amsterdam is a super safe city I&#x27;ve lived all my life. (and I&#x27;ve traveled and lived in 4 continents so I can compare.) In terms of safety, sadly no developed country compares to the US, it&#x27;s that bad.<p>I&#x27;ll tell you the actual murder rates for Amsterdam and the Netherlands for 2014. Amsterdam 20, the Netherlands 137.<p>Per 100k that&#x27;s about 1.5 for Amsterdam (for comparison, 1.3 in 2010, 1.5 in 2011), the most dangerous city in the Netherlands, and 0.8 for the Netherlands.",1440252450

As we gradually end the war on drugs, it&#x27;s likely to drop a lot further.<p>If we get that 4.x rate down to a high 2.x rate in the next 20 years, would that not be a solid accomplishment given the guns in America? At the rate violent crime has been dropping over time, that&#x27;s likely to be the outcome.<p>And as I&#x27;ve noted previously, America in fact has a lot of cities with extremely low murder rates. If you want to live in a very safe city, there are plenty of options.<p>Let&#x27;s look at San Diego versus Amsterdam: nearly twice the population and nearly half the murder rate.",1440252412

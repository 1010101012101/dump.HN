My name is Rajiv (rajiv@wisewindow.com), and I am founder of WiseWindow (http://www.wisewindow.com). WiseWindow tracks opinions in social internet 24x7 and creates a structured database that is maintained in real-time. Imagine a mashup between Twitter/Blog/Youtube/Facebook/Message Forums conversational data with a structured product hierarchy on e-commerce sites such as Amazon. This allows one to take social internet and measure market share within Smartphone market or Romantic movie genre, or stocks within Healthcare sector, or market share within Domestic Airlines, or which app in appstore is resonating most with certain genre etc. So along these lines we have built a real-time conversational database that has sentiments and dimensions/topical themes across Games, Healthcare, Airlines, Autos, Politics, TV Shows, Movies, Music, Politics etc. The key is predictability or forecasting of future sales/events etc using social internet.<p>We have some of the largest financial firms/data providers, auto companies, media using our data through RESTful API syndication and integration that has permeated to the top of the org. We have been profiled by Forbes/Economist/New Scientist and many other publications, and I am sure you can google it. So at this point we are a B2B player, not B2C player.<p>As the founder, I feel we haven't tapped all applications of the vast database of more than 1.2B opinions being crawled and collected with 100s or millions of user profiles etc especially in B2C space mostly due to lack of resources and to be candid, sensibility.<p>I am interested knowing if anybody here is interested in collaborating/syndicating data to build some interesting apps that go onto iPhone/Android phones or other consumer apps along the lines of recommendation engines (such as what game somebody would like if they picked certain app etc), and other apps. I would support them personally in terms of knowhow, data, computing resources etc. So consider this as incubator for social internet apps bootstrap with data etc.<p>Regarding technology, I would be happy to share and lend expertise with you details on architecture which is based on Solr/Mongo/Postgres/Ruby on Rails/Pipeline processing on EC2/RabbitMQ etc. We do lot of machine learing, Statistical NLP, Clustering, Classifications (ensemble techniques).

Wasn't part of the reasoning behind new hardware being required was that much of the translation is being done ON the phone, not in ""the cloud""? Or is this now wrong?<p>I'm going under the assumption that Siri translates words to text/commands on the phone device. It then determines whether that command is ""local"" or ""remote."" If local, it does whatever it needs (create an alarm, add a calendar event). If remote, send it to the Siri servers for them to process.<p>In the case of apps, they'd all be local. The app could remotely access data required on it's own, not needing the Siri servers for that. So, just like the new notification preferences, Siri gets a preference that gives you a list of all commands, and for those commands you can select which application responds to it. Obviously there may be better ways to handle the interface, Apps may have their own preferences and you can tell the app to register it's commands. Regardless, there are better minds thinking of this stuff than my own.<p>So, in this particular scenario, there's no need to ""phrase squat"" or anything. The whole idea of this article seems ridiculous given how I interpret how Siri functions. Which again, could be wrong.",1318779679

3117507,comment,3116495,3116495,26,0,tokenadult,,,"A good reality check on several of the assertions made in the article, or in the comments here, about Finland is to look at another country high in international educational rankings, namely Singapore. I have known people from Singapore (mostly students at my state's flagship university) since the mid-1970s. Always, they have been amazingly smart people. I have been curious about how schooling is done in Singapore since well before the first time that Singapore was included in an international education study.<p>Chapter 1: ""International Student Achievement in Mathematics"" from the TIMSS 2007 study of mathematics achievement in many different countries includes, in Exhibit 1.1 (pages 34 and 35)<p><a href=""http://pirls.bc.edu/timss2007/PDF/T07_M_IR_Chapter1.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://pirls.bc.edu/timss2007/PDF/T07_M_IR_Chapter1.pdf</a><p>a chart of mathematics achievement levels in various countries. Although the United States is above the international average score among the countries surveyed, as we would expect from the level of economic development in the United States, the United States is well below the top country listed, which is Singapore. An average United States student is at the bottom quartile level for Singapore, or from another point of view, a top quartile student in the United States is only at the level of an average student in Singapore. I have lived for years in one of the other countries that regularly outperforms the United States in those studies, Taiwan, and will also comment on the Taiwan educational experience as a reality check on the comments on Finland in this thread.<p>I am amazed that persons from Singapore in my generation (born in the late 1950s) grew up in a country that was extremely poor (it's hard to remember that about Singapore, but until the 1970s Singapore was definitely part of the Third World) and were educated in a foreign language (the language of schooling in Singapore has long been English, but the home languages of most Singaporeans are south Chinese languages like my wife's native Hokkien or Austronesian languages like Malay or Indian languages like Tamil) and yet received very thorough instruction in mathematics. Singapore is very diverse linguistically--the MAJORITY of the population in my generation spoke NONE of the four official languages (Mandarin Chinese, Malay, Tamil, or English) in standard form at home, and certainly not the main language of school instruction, English, but Singapore has become part of the ""outer circle"" of use of English internationally and now maintains a high degree of multilingualism. I hope that all of us here in the United States can do at least that well both in language learning and in mathematics learning in the current generation.<p>The article ""The Singaporean Mathematics Curriculum: Connections to TIMSS""<p><a href=""http://www.merga.net.au/documents/RP182006.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.merga.net.au/documents/RP182006.pdf</a><p>by a Singaporean author explains some of the background to the Singapore math materials and how they approach topics that are foundational for later mathematics study.

I think so too after living in Taiwan twice in my adult life (January 1982 through February 1985, and December 1998 through July 2001).   I have seen (and used) the textbooks from Singapore and from Taiwan. They are much more clear in their presentation and much more conceptually accurate than the typical United States textbooks. Moreover, elementary mathematics teachers tend to specialize in teaching mathematics while other elementary teachers teach other subjects, at much younger ages than when United States pupils typically encounter specialist teachers. The United States model of elementary education is to have teachers who are jacks of all trades and masters of none, and who do equally poorly (by reasonable international standards) in teaching reading, mathematics, science, and all other elementary subjects.<p>The United States could do a lot better and reach the level of Finland by staffing reforms<p><a href=""http://edpro.stanford.edu/hanushek/admin/pages/files/uploads/Hanushek%202009%20CNTP%20ch%208.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://edpro.stanford.edu/hanushek/admin/pages/files/uploads...</a><p>and by using best practices<p><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Teaching-Gap-Improving-Education-Classroom/dp/0684852748"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Teaching-Gap-Improving-Education-Class...</a><p>in provision of elementary education.",1318779613

Depending on how you measure, it can actually be said to be cheaper: the US spends more of its GDP in education.<p>* No, the teachers in Finland are not paid a big salary to motivate them. They earn more or less the average salary of workers with a university degree.<p>* No, it's not just about Finland being more culturally and ethnically homogeneous, or just about child poverty being more rare. There are many other countries like this and they don't automatically get good results in education.<p>* No, the Finnish children are not highly motivated to go to school, to learn and to achieve. Actually, Finland gets its results despite worse than average motivation, attitude towards school etc.<p>* No, it's not about the Finnish language being ""easier"" to learn: Being ""easy"" is subjective and it takes the Finnish children the normal time to learn to speak.<p>* No, it's not about the written Finnish being highly phonemic and thus easy to learn to read and write. Many other languages (such as Spanish, Swedish) are highly phonemic as well. The time saved in not having to learn the spelling of each word in the Finnish dictionary separately is spent on the efforts to learn the completely different vocabulary and highly different phonetics and grammar of English as a second language.<p>* No, it's not just about Finnish being a highly agglutinative language where you can guess e.g. from the word for voltage that it has something to do with some kind of tension. Or maybe it is, I don't have good evidence about this...

For a new programmer, C++ is not particularly user friendly at all (believe me, I <i>was</i> that new programmer) but I think it's often taught as a first language because by throwing you in the deep end (with pointers, cryptic compilation errors, overflow issues and extensive but often quite primitive features) it teaches you about the logic and principles of programming.

3117462,comment,3116495,3117417,0,0,pacala,,,"Thanks for the attention to terminology detail. The anglo corporation is the finest outcome of the anglo capitalism. If you build a system around anglo capitalist rules, you end up with anglo corporations. The reason is that the anglo capitalism prides itself economic freedom and turns a blind eye to the political aspect of the economy. The fundamental problems with anglo capitalism are:<p>1. Money, an economic concept, and the freedom to accumulate as much money as one can possibly do, an economic freedom, wield real political power. The political power then acts as a positive feedback over the economic field resulting in an unstable polarized system.<p>2. The system assumes infinite resources. This is blatantly false both in the short term, economy grows only at X% annually, and in the long term, there is just one Earth and one Sun. This places people on the lower rungs of the economic system on an intrinsic inferior bargaining position, as their very existence is under question. This time the effect is that people on the top ownership rungs have more economic power, which acts as a positive feedback resulting in an unstable polarized system.<p>Historically, anglo capitalism has been controlled via a number of negative feedback loops:<p>A. Democracy, as a counterweight to point 1. The 99% used to have a significant share of the political power. Not anymore. There is no more democracy in America, it's a political market where the deepest pockets but the most representatives.<p>B. Trade unions, as a counterweight to point 1 and 2. Trade unions used to have enough money to match the 1% contributions to politics. Trade unions used to give the 99% some bargaining power. Thanks to Reagan and the modern Republicans, there are no more trade unions to speak of.<p>C. Taxes, as a counterpoint to 1 and 2. There used to be taxes, that both detracted from the ability of 1% to wield unfettered political power and served at building a safety net that improved the bargaining power of the 99%. Not anymore, we now raise about 25% less in taxes as a share of GDP as we used to (19& -> 15%), and the trend towards ""smaller government"" is only accelerating.<p>We observe how the finest anglo capitalism economic entities have more and more power, both economic and politic.

The bedrooms and dining room typically have light fixtures in the middle of the ceiling.  The only room without lights is typically the living room.  We also have closets which are a great deal less common in Europe.<p>Another big difference is that most American apartments have ""wall to wall carpeting"", something apparently so unusual in other countries that I often have to explain what on earth that means to foreign friends (the carpet is installed as part of the floor and nailed down).  In your typical American apartment, you have vinyl flooring in front of the front door, in the bathrooms and in the kitchen. All other areas have wall to wall carpeting.  From what I gather, wood, tile or similar flooring is far more common in other countries.  I have respiratory problems and allergies.  I wish I could find an apartment here with wood floors.  Wall to wall carpeting is something I loathe.  In the US, if you want wood and tile floors throughout the home to accommodate allergies and respiratory problems, you pretty much have buy your own house (or possibly live in New York, which I have no plans to do).  In fact, wall to wall carpeting is so common here that even if you buy a house, you probably either have to rip out carpeting and install your own flooring or have the house custom built.<p>I am betting that the lack of carpeting is something the author of this article would view as proof of being ""a dive""/slum.  Lack of carpeting does occur in some older American homes, often ones which were never upgraded.  So it tends to get interpreted by Americans as a mark of poverty.  Given my health issues, I tend to side more with some of my foreign friends who are sometimes appalled at the idea of wall to wall carpeting and find the idea disgusting and unclean.<p>Last, I will note that I have lived in five different US states and every rental market has its quirks.  I lived from age 3 to age 20 in the same town.  When I first left home, moving to another part of the US was something of a shock as well.  In short, anyone who feels strongly that the rental/housing market should behave X way should just stay where they are.  (It won't stay the same where they are either, but the changes are likely to be more gradual and thus less shocking than moving elsewhere.)<p>Peace.",1318777799

Then I remembered that the advice also suggests skipping all side-quests. If you're only playing the main-quest stuff in those games, though, you're missing out on the best content.<p>I'm not a big fan on limiting game play in this way, but I also recognize that different things work (or don't) for different people.",1318777590

I am a fifth-generation descendant of my family living in this state, but I think and act considerably differently from my great-great-great grandfather and his son who first settled in this state before the Civil War. I differ pretty substantially culturally from my late dad, really, as does America as a whole from his generation to mine.<p>One thing that promotes cultural change is interchange and communication among different cultures. Individual human beings are acculturated by their upbringing in one culture or another, but also pick and choose what cultural practices they desire to follow among the cultural practices they know about. Leadership of a school system (or of a country) involves urging people to follow cultural practices that will be to their long-term advantage, and setting up incentives so that individual human beings are nudged into following those practices.<p>(Basis of knowledge: many-generations European-American who has lived overseas in east Asia twice in his life, married to a spouse who grew up in east Asia of east Asian ancestry since earliest historical times. We have a pick-and-choose blended culture in our family, and note that we have genuinely multicultural relatives, friends, neighbors, clients and work colleagues who pick and choose what cultural influences they follow.)",1318777579

The Apple version's 2nd cloud on the left (the small one) has a decidedly flatter curve to it than the same cloud in Pictos which sticks out further. If you overlay these two icons (which should have been the first thing the author did in his entry, but chose not to) this difference and other very small differences would have been made obvious.<p>Having the same general shape and layout is one thing but being exactly, pixel-precise the same is quite another.",1318777461

Every university will have a number of documents defining the level of privacy and security provided by each  involved entity. If exporting the information to google means that some rule is broken -- for example if bulk transfers of personal information are forbidden and people start using gmail as a basic tool of document exchange, something has to change. And sometimes it's easier to change the technology provider than people... Even if no local regulations stop them, there might be some law about personal data processing that completely prevents gmail usage for some specific organisation.<p>You'll also find that serious tech. universities do have their own power generators for emergencies.",1273093194

There is more to the market then just financial transactions. Everything we do: how we elect to use our time, the care we invest in a relationship, everything, is a decision about how we use our limited resources (time and attention in my two examples, but the potential list covers literally everything). And we necessarily make those decisions by weighing what we expect their costs to be versus what we expect to derive from them. And that is what the study of economics is about -- money is only the smallest part of it.</i><p>Those postdocs derive greater satisfaction from doing their science than they would by tending bar. In their own internal calculus, the rewards of their career are greater than the simple money equation.<p>Progressives like to think they're being deep and insightful when they observe that there's more to the world than just money. But it's not news to anyone, least of all to economists. This is embodied in the concept of <i>utility</i>. See <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utility"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utility</a> :<p><i>Utility is usually applied by economists in such constructs as the indifference curve, which plot the combination of commodities that an individual or a society would accept to maintain a given level of satisfaction. ... [Quoting Paul Samuelson] ""Utility is taken to be correlative to Desire or Want. It has been already argued that desires cannot be measured directly, but only indirectly, by the outward phenomena to which they give rise: and that in those cases with which economics is chiefly concerned the measure is found in the price which a person is willing to pay for the fulfilment or satisfaction of his desire.""</i><p>Thus, in the case of your hypothetical postdoc, the opportunity to do his (or her) science is worth $60K.

It was hell, where I couldn't penalize any worker for showing up late, for not working, for leaving early.  Some workers could not be motivated, period, as 'senior' union employees told them the tricks that made it so they didn't have to work hard.  Meanwhile, my trucks were late to pull, meaning I got my ass chewed out, because I regularly had 3/10 employees skip work.  The only way I could get things going was to literally bribe them with popsicles (hot warehouse in summer) and energy drinks from my own pocket $$$.  The worst was having to give skilled positions to the most senior, rather than the most capable.  Made for a nightmare operating environment.<p>However, my dad is a union employee - he works on elevators.  It's a small union, and it doesn't have a bunch of 'no penalization' bullshit, and no seniority promotion clauses.  The benefit it offers are a standardized health care package, so he can keep the same healthcare and retirement regardless of employer (there are only a few elevator companies anyway).  The union also guarantees overtime.  He can still get canned if he starts skipping work, doesn't perform etc, it just takes legitimate documentation to have happen.<p>There are upsides and downsides, but I believe a well run union is a good thing, but in general unions are not well run and are in actuality, terrible for the private sector.",1273090421

If there was such a trove of hidden value, you would think that some greedy capitalist would snap it up and exploit it.<p><i>If a person chooses to enrich humanity's lot by providing value outside of the marketplace, it is the responsibility of society to support them.</i><p>This isn't a question of differing philosophies and values. This is just objectively wrong. In the degenerate case, if we all decide to become poets, then who is going to farm the food to feed us all? This should clue you in to the fallacy of your statement above. The <i>marginal</i> value of an additional poet is lower than the marginal value of another farmer, or another assembly line worker, or another programmer.<p>Moreover, there is no such thing as ""outside the marketplace"". There is more to the market then just financial transactions. Everything we do: how we elect to use our time, the care we invest in a relationship, everything, is a decision about how we use our limited resources (time and attention in my two examples, but the potential list covers literally everything). And we necessarily make those decisions by weighing what we expect their costs to be versus what we expect to derive from them.

Of the three cubicles bordering on mine, two of them are occupied by females; shall I call software development a ""female"" field? If not, then why would I ever praise it?<p>But your statement is its own dis-proof. You (and the rest of the ""progressives"") are praising what you label ""female fields"", and implicitly condemning the ""male"" ones. Doesn't this show <i>a priori</i> that we don't universally favor one or the other, but rather have, as a society, a diverse set of opinions?<p>Finally, I'd like to retell an old joke from my (engineering) college:<p><i>Scientists learn to ask ""why does that work?"".

The governments obviously hope to recoup their ""investments"" when the company goes public again, which may or may not happen.<p>They repaid the loan because they ended up not needing the cash. It can't get simpler than that. The only question is whether they overstated their original request, or if they really have turned around enough.",1273089770
1322351,comment,1321443,1321443,0,0,btilly,,,"My main concern with the hype around memristors is how quickly the technology will scale.  Yes, they have great promise.  But if technical problems make them 4 times bigger and 8 times slower than existing technology, nobody will adopt them.  And without volume adoption, they won't have enough investment dollars to be able to exceed Moore's Law.  Which means that we won't care about them until well after Moore's Law runs out of steam.<p>This is not a theoretical failure mode.  It has happened before in the computer industry.  Multiple times.<p>For example it is why Transmeta died.  Their goal was to have a simple chip that was so fast that they could emulate the x86 faster than the x86 could run.  They failed.  However one of the design goals was less heat (because heat was a major scaling barrier), which translated into having an emulated x86 chip that with much lower power.  Given that they had a simpler architecture and had already solved heat problems that were killing Intel and AMD they hoped to iterate faster, and eventually win.  But the investment asymmetry was so huge that they couldn't execute on the plan.  And Intel was able to reduce their power enough to undercut Transmeta on the niche they had found, and Transmeta couldn't survive.  (Intel was aggressive because they understood the strategy and the potential.  Transmeta was always going to be something that either wiped out the existing industry or died with a whimper, and Intel knew which outcome they'd prefer.)",1273089760

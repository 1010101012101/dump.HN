1524526,comment,1524201,1524201,0,0,_delirium,,,"There seem to be two sort of unrelated criticisms here. One's a preference for GUI (or at least full-screen console-mode) interfaces over CLIs, and generally for fewer config files and command-line options. The other is a dislike of chaining piped commands, and a suggestion that integrated scripting languages like Perl are the replacement. But those seem like two pretty wildly different directions to go in. And there doesn't seem to be any argument for either of the points, just personal preference (""I don't like the Unix aesthetic, and you shouldn't either"").<p>The more specific examples are pretty weird, also. Just about every Unix comes with a full-screen text file viewer ('nano' is a decent one). If you don't like bash, you can use a different shell; I mean, he was willing to use a third-party shell on Windows, why not on Unix?

Ideally I'd have a catchy line like the one you made and then a slideshow of beautifully designed Facebook pages with a link to the actual live FB instance.<<<<p>Don't do a slideshow either. It takes too long to load on a slower internet connection and people tend to lose interest by that time. Instead photoshop something like coverflow with 3 beautiful pages. I am not telling you to rip off coverflow. Don't do that. Your customers are very sensitive to such things<p>Make a draft layout on paper and play with it. Cut out pieces of paper and move it around on your desk.<p>>>>My goal here is to validate the core concept, hopefully gain some useful contacts/help and of course get some beta users.<<<<p>I can understand that, but they are humans too and humans tend to get bored if they aren't engaged within those first 20-30 seconds. I am not asking you to make a fluff piece. No, I am asking you to make a hook to pull users in.<p>>>>As for the intermediate thing, definitely. If I can grab a couple of interested users, it would not be too difficult to build upon the functionality. My concern as of now is just to laser focus on my own unique angle. Pagemodo is really not something I'd want to emulate personally, but having easy wysiwyg templates is definitely useful.<<<<p>That sounds wise, but be careful not to box yourself in. I wish I could advise you more, but I haven't done any serious software development. So, I have no clue what challenges it brings on this side.<p>>>>I appreciate your feedback. Do you mind if I try to implement your phrasing?<<<<p>Of course not!

But now that you mention it, it does sound like a great app.<p>You could have an extension that indexes everything the user goes to. The trick would be making it usable; I almost never use the ""history"" in my browser, because it tends to never find what I'm looking for. But if you try and solve it in a centralized way, you could do several interesting things:<p>* Make searches across all the sites you visited work better, maybe by creating better indexes of the content.<p>* Make the search work according to sites you visited the most (e.g. I'd prefer the search to find comments on HN before other things, then articles linked to from HN, etc.).<p>Such a service might be pretty useful: browser history that doesn't suck, and is persistent and accessible online.

(Using the current screen gamma would be pretty arbitrary for an image editor.)  Trying to ""convert"" between different gamma values during processing likely will do more harm than good if your entire pipeline doesn't have this philosophy, or worse, if only one program (e.g. Photoshop) or format (e.g. PNG) does.<p>I suppose PNG files win a prize for carrying gamma information, so that web browsers and image viewers can apply a curve in software that throws off their brightness and contrast relative to everything around them?  And when Photoshop decides the colors in my GIF file need to be ""converted"" to sRGB from god-knows-what it thinks they were before?<p>If you want every last image operation to be done with perceptual accuracy, convert your images to some fancy color space like CIELAB, after careful consideration of their intended source gamma and color space, and do your calculations there; then somehow be sure they are accurately converted for display on the user's monitor.",1279394947

From everything that I've seen, making a way to publicise a list of bookmarks could help you if you're going the latter route.<p>> It might, however, be a typical case of the users not knowing what they want, because nobody seems to mind facebook...<p>Yes, my first thought was, ""I'd only use this if it's private"" - my second thought was, ""Wait, actually, I'd use it either way, pretty similarly, and there'd be additional value if it's public."" I might see what people choose instead of what people say. People talk a lot and then do different things. Just something to think about, and congrats on launching a pretty cool service.",1279393504

In fact he mentions several issues that bother him in his day to day use of the language. The problem with a lot of the anti-C++ rants is that they make it sound like it is impossible to get anything done in C++, which of course is not the case. Memory management for example is often brought up as a major issue with C++. I have been in 200+kloc projects that never leak memory and very, very rarely have to call delete. Just use RAII - it's not rocket science.",1279393503

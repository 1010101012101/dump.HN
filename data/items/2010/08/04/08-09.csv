1574015,comment,1573304,1573773,0,0,jacquesm,,,"Technically nothing stops you from opening the raw device and to start reading packets. Sooner or later you'll need to figure out when your packets can be forwarded to the next layer for processing so work can be done for a particular connection.<p>And that's what the kernel did for you all along. The abstraction of file descriptors for clients is a useful one, it allows you to decide what to do. The decision here is not 'do I want all this data in one stream' or 'do I want it demultiplexed', the kernel does a fairly good job of the demultiplexing that needs to be done anyway (re-assembling a stream of packets in to functioning connections is non-trivial) and it exports that interface to all user processes to avoid having to recreate that useful abstraction in those user processes.<p>It's possible there is some gain to be had by 'rolling your own' and by getting rid of the kernel abstraction by collapsing all these layers in to a single user mode program.<p>But I think you'd soon find that you are simply re-implementing all that code, and that instead of a clean (poll or epoll, either is fairly clean) interface you'd be bogged down in maintaining your own tcp stack.<p>I once ran in to a situation like the one you describe. I was the programmer in charge of coding up a driver for a high speed serial card (high speed at the time, nowadays we'd laugh at it) doing X.25. I'd nicely laid it out as two separate pieces of software talking to each other using message passing on a weird but wonderful little os called QnX. One process to handle the data link layer, one to handle the X.25 protocol.<p>After a series of benchmarks with 8 such cards in a single ISA industrial enclosure, together with a (for the time) very expensive micronics 33 MHz motherboard I figured that maybe we can gain some performance by merging the two processes, to save on the IPC. The end result? Identical performance, in spite of the message passing overhead the bit-twiddling, checksumming and actual IO was such a large portion of the work done that the IPC didn't matter at all performance wise.<p>But it did matter to the code, the second version was decidedly harder to debug and maintain, and eventually that 'branch' was scrapped in favour of the one where the layers were clearly separated.<p>Poll and Epoll are communications mechanisms, they communicate with the kernel about the state of a bunch of fds. Both implement the same functionality (as long as you don't use the actual events of epoll) from a programmers point of view. Both have slightly different use cases, and for some situations it may be advantageous to use the one or the other. There may be a difference, but on the whole it will probably not be a very large one once you factor in all the other stuff that needs doing.",1280911975

So I can't say the system is really in place to support people who do their own thing. It's not a realistic option for most people to start deviating from schooling. I mean you've got to be really above average to be able to quit or marginalize school and still succeed in our institutionalized world. You'd basically have to start from scratch (or at least start much lower than if you subjected yourself to the education system).<p>The dilemma here is that some students when left alone can thrive without having a safety net education regiment, while some may just play games all day and waste away. And perhaps some may get too specialized and lack other basic skills a standardized education would guarantee. I think if there is going to be change, we have to start looking into whether or not those things are true. Lots of kids are home schooled right? The data should be there.<p>If kids have to learn how to drive then they should do the driving, and school should just provide the vehicle.

1573996,comment,1573304,1573708,0,0,jacquesm,,,"You should read more carefully. 40% was the highest observed, 10% the lowest. Also, I said 'the majority', which is not like making it seem like it is only 10%. So it's not '10%' or '40%', for this particular workload, on average you're hovering somewhere between 25 and 30%, since you seem to prefer the higher number make that 30%. And if you read a bit more you would see that there are some factors that could pull that number down considerably in different situations and only one major one (large file serving, streaming) that would pull it up.<p>If I get around to it (I'm on a holiday right now) I'm going to instrument some more sites to measure their active-to-total ratios to see if there is some kind of number (or a set of them) that we might be able to agree on when it comes to real life web traffic. One of them is a filedump, which serves up large media files to clients, that's the use case that I can come up with in which your scheme might pay off, and in which it is possibly advantageous (even if it is a very small advantage) to use poll.<p>You keep 'challenging' people to come up with numbers. So, I did, from a real life webserver serving real customers, lots of them. If 60% is the cutoff point (and we're assuming that you are right about that) then 40% is comfortably under that, not 'much higher' than what I wrote in my previous comments, the majority (60 to 90%) of the fds is idle.  So it's not in to 'equal performance levels' yet.<p>But as far as I'm concerned even that is probably moot. (But that needs more testing) because I suspect that even this fairly high traffic server spends only very small amount of time on polling the OS, and a much larger time on shovelling bits in and out of the system.<p>You keep using that word 'science' as though measuring anything at all is automatically science.<p>But what you're doing is more like selecting the data that fits your 'who needs epoll' and 'epoll is bad' hypothesis and rejecting out of hand any experience and / or experimental data that seems to prove you wrong.<p>That's not science. Science is to use all the data available to you, not just the juicy bits. Not just those bits that allow you to make bold claims about discoveries when in fact all you've done is to show that the underlying implementation of one systemcall is different and has different trade-offs than another, which may be specific to the way <i>your</i> system is set up.<p>I agree that to test something you need to reduce it to the minimum of code required to do your tests. But when you're going that route you are doing what so many other database, CPU and application benchmarkers forget. The real world is <i>nothing</i> like a benchmark.<p>You to suggest that this is 'not a localhost test' (<a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1573195"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1573195</a>) and you say so pretty loud. That would mean that there may be some validity to your data that I have not been able to find to date in the stuff you've provided.<p>I'm challenging you to provide the data that apparently is still missing that proves that this was not 'a localhost test'.<p>And if you don't supply that data then I think you should take back (and try to do it gracriously for a change) that this wasn't a local host test, or you're going to have to come with some definition of what you consider a localhost test to be.<p>For me, that definition is simple, a localhost test is a benchmark that never generates any network traffic.<p>Feel free to disagree.",1280911046

I've often thought that the argument that ""if you can't find at least one person to join you, then your idea (or you) must not be that great"" was a little disingenuous. That statement makes sense in certain contexts, such as when someone has just graduated from university and is living rent free in their parent's basement (it is assumed that their potential co-founders are in a similar situation). It makes less sense when a person is working 9-5 and has a mortgage. It turns out that individuals who are willing to burn the midnight oil for months or years after getting off work because they are passionate about an idea are quite rare. The likelihood of finding a similar individual to partner with within their network of friends, and who will contribute at a commensurate level, is diminishingly small. Perpetuating the above idea does this group a disservice. Instead of rooting for them we are, in essence, saying, “there’s something wrong with you or your idea” per se if you’re a single founder.",1280910934

Using it enough makes you kind of itch for the paid one a little, because it has some nice additional features, and eventually you try to upgrade.<p>Then the fact that you don't actually live in the UK gets exposed by your credit card and you go back to the free/proxied version :) Regardless, another Yahoo Music/Rhapsody/whatever really doesn't seem like a big deal.",1280909706

(Which they usually already had from jobs in highschool anyways.) The only positive effect I've seen is that people realize they don't want to work a shit job for the rest of their lives, and get some motivation for education. On the margin this is definitely a win when it happens, but I've never seen the sort of identity discovery you're describing actually occur.",1280909658

Most of the good/cheap flight schools are in Florida (since the weather is consistent, land/fuel/etc. is cheap -- one of the main issues with doing VFR training in a place with variable weather is that VFR conditions aren't always met).  I think Arizona and Texas are popular too.",1280909644

For example, one person might be able to get insanely good at math, while another is awful at math but is an amazing artist.<p>I can accept that there may be overall differences in the potential levels between individuals but I don't think that difference should be anything remotely as dramatic as what we're seeing right now (especially in the US).",1280909481

A person should not consider college unless they have some focus or understanding of why they are there.  With focus, so much more will be achieved with what's given to them.<p>How do you gain focus?  First and foremost life experience.  Secondly, applied knowledge in areas that interests you or attracts your attention.  This knowledge can be learned at school, though it's a terribly ineffective way of doing so.",1280909302

1573955,comment,1571867,1571867,0,0,korch,,,"I think the problem with the CrapStore isn't that there is too much crap(Sturgeon's Law afterall, it's to be expected), rather Apple's interface to search, sort and present apps <i>completely fucking sucks</i>. Apple really ought to at least try to be more like Google search. What's ultimately tragic is that Apple won't let anyone else make a better or even different interface for searching for apps <i>and</i> have it be available as an app on the AppStore. What Google gets right is that any idiot can find what they want, nearly immediately, and they don't even need to see or know just how much total crap is out there on the web.<p>Seriously, what the hell is Steve thinking with so many hundreds of thousands of apps? When you want vanilla apps that are simple and popular enough that you know ahead of time which app you want, then the AppStore is great. When you trek even slightly off the beaten path, maybe exploring what's out there, or looking for something very specific and rare, and for which you would be willing to pay a lot more than $0.99, well, that ends up being a lost cause. All iPhone devs know that users simply won't spend any time sifting through apps, and this is why spamming your way to the top of any category lists is just as important as being on Google SERP #1.<p>Case in point: tonight I went to order a pizza, and thought to myself that it might be neat to try one of the pizza ordering apps. Seconds later I'm scrolling through more than 50 different pizza apps. Half of them I can't even tell whether they are for ordering pizza, nor whether they are local, nationwide, integrated with chains or just mom & pops. If I can't figure it out, and I'm a programmer, how well will a completely non-technical person fare? Do I have 30 minutes to tap and dig down multiple menu levels on several of them, read each one's spamtastic description, then read the user reviews which are worse than YouTube comments, then install it and try it out? Then do that again 50 more times? Does Steve think I'm a moron? If you can't even create software that can semantically represent ""order a pizza local to me"", how the fuck can we expect them to do something more complex?\nI ended up going to dominos.com in Safari.<p>It's almost as if Apple doesn't give a shit about promoting exceptional software for the long haul over the next few years, no, they only care about churning a fast buck right now, with a horizon of just a few business quarters ahead. What Apple will end up doing is driving all of their users to the web, and then html5 is going to mop the floor with Apple's entire Objective-C walled garden. Sorry, as much as the web is flawed, it is always going to be infinitely more simple to use than apps.",1280909183

Adding it and then removing it in an incompatible way.<p>If you want to make python 3 more attractive maybe make migration easier before going on to the fun improvements? There are low-hanging fruits for migration too. How about adding back the print statement?",1429080991

9379262,comment,9378898,9378898,0,0,Animats,,,"It&#x27;s not about a need for new features. It&#x27;s about basic quality control. I recently ported a medium-sized production system (the back end of &quot;sitetruth.com&quot;) from Python 2 to Python 3. It took about a month. Not because of the language changes, but because several major third-party packages were discontinued for Python 3, and their replacements were buggy.<p>Specifically:<p>- Python 3 forces you to use CPickle instead of the Python version of Pickle. In some multi-thread/multiprocess situations, CPickle has some memory allocation error, Python&#x27;s memory becomes corrupted, and things go downhill to a crash. The Python version is fine. I submitted a bug report, but nothing will happen unless I come up with a simple test case, which is hard.  Meanwhile I found out how to use the Python version, which works, despite Python 3, and am using that.<p>- PyMySQL (a &quot;drop in replacement&quot; for MySQLdb) originally didn&#x27;t implement LOAD DATA LOCAL.  When it was implemented, it wasn&#x27;t tested for large data loads.  I kept getting random database disconnects, until I figured out that it was trying to send the entire bulk data load as one 16MB MySQL connection packet.  This only works if you configure insanely big buffers in your MySQL server. There&#x27;s no reason to send a packet that big; LOAD DATA LOCAL will use multiple packets when necessary.  It was just a lame default.<p>- HTML parsing uses different packages under Python 3. The HTML5parser/BS4 combination blows up on some bad HTML, usually involving misplaced items that belong in the HEAD section. The HTML5 parser, obeying the HTML5 spec for tolerating bad HTML, tries to add to the tree being produced at points other than after the last item. BS4 is buggy in that area.  I wrote a function to check and fix defective BS4 trees, came up with a simple test case, and submitted a bug report.  I have a workaround for now.<p>- Python 3 finally has TLS support in SSL.  (That&#x27;s also been backported to Python 2.7.9).  SSL cert checking is now on by default. It doesn&#x27;t work for certain sites, including &quot;verisign.com&quot;.  This is because of a complicated interaction between a cross-signed root certificate Verisign created, a feature of OpenSSL, and how the Python &quot;ssl&quot; package calls OpenSSL.  It took weeks of work to get that fixed. Because it&#x27;s a core Python package, it will remain broken until the next release of Python, 3.5, whenever that happens.<p>- Running FCGI/WSGI programs from Apache requires a different package than with Python 2. There are 11 different packages and versions of packages for doing this.  The Python documentation recommended one that hadn&#x27;t been updated since 2007, and its SVN repository was gone.  There are six forks of it on Github, three of them abandoned.  I finally found a derivative version from which much of the unnecessary stuff had been stripped out, and it worked.<p>- Python&#x27;s installer program, &quot;pip3&quot;, doesn&#x27;t know which packages work under Python 3, and tried to install a version of one of them that only worked with Python 2.5-2.6. You have to know to install &quot;dnspython3&quot;, not &quot;dnspython&quot;, for example.<p>These are all bugs that should have been found by now, and would have if Python 3 had a more substantial user base. We&#x27;re six years into Python 3.  I shouldn&#x27;t be finding beta-version bugs like these at this late date.<p>Python&#x27;s Little Tin God&#x27;s position on third-party library problems is that it&#x27;s not Python&#x27;s problem.  His fanboys follow along.  (Comment on comp.lang.python: &quot;You have found yet another poorly-maintained package which is not at all the responsibility of Python 3. Why are you discussing it as if Python 3 is at fault?&quot;) As a result, PyPi (Python&#x27;s third-party package list) has no quality control.  Perl&#x27;s CPAN has reviews, testing, and hosts the actual packages.  Most of Go&#x27;s key packages are well-exercised within Google and maintained there.  PyPi is just a link farm.<p>That&#x27;s why Python 3 isn&#x27;t getting used. It&#x27;s not a need for new features.  It&#x27;s that Python 3 doesn&#x27;t work out of the box.  Its supporters are in heavy denial about this.",1429080597

9379238,comment,9378898,9378898,0,0,danso,,,"This year I&#x27;ve been spending a lot of time learning Python as I can tell, even being a longtime Rubyist, that Python is the better language for teaching and for general purpose usage...and since Python 3 is already pretty mature, I figured I should just pretend that Python 2 doesn&#x27;t exist...<p>Well, after a month of studying, using, and teaching the language...all I can say is, the conflict between 2 and 3 definitely lives up to the hype :)...Most of the changes make sense to me, and even as a &quot;do-whatever-you-feel-like-aesthetically&quot; Rubyist, I appreciate what Guido did/attempted to do in the clean-up. But things like lambda...there obviously was no easy answer...I love lambdas, but it&#x27;s so functionally limited and awkward in Python that I also see Guido&#x27;s point about just removing it from the language (ultimately, he gave up on that)...<p>But what about the built-in reduce()? Again, it&#x27;s another function that I instinctively reach for as a Rubyist...and yet it&#x27;s so awkward in Python that, again, like lambda, maybe it should die? But in this case, Guido halfway-won, and now it&#x27;s been pushed into the functools package. Mmmkay. And so it is with so many of the 2 to 3 changes at the interface level...as a newbie, it&#x27;s just mostly amusing since I have no legacy code to port over, but I definitely understand the strife.<p>But the conflict is still hard to avoid as a newbie...many of the most used guides (LPTHW, Codecademy&#x27;s Python track) are just done in Python 2...LPTHW says right up front to stay the fuck away from 3.x. I don&#x27;t think Codecademy even bothers to mention what version they&#x27;re teaching...obviously, beginners don&#x27;t need to get into the version wars, but as soon as they get past Codecademy and start Googling around, they&#x27;re going to be in for some surprises.<p>Hell, the act of Googling is itself affected by the version-wars...everytime I google for commands/subsections in the official Python docs, the version 2.x docs are always at top. Sometimes the 3.x docs don&#x27;t even show up. At least I know that there&#x27;s a 3.x and how to manually switch to those docs...imagine all the novices who are also Googling for references...it&#x27;s not hard to think that the cycle of 2.x indoctrination is propped up by the simple fact that 2.x docs/help are always at the top of the Google results.",1429079936

Do you trust the chain of dependencies all the way down to also be willing to do the same?<p>As a responsible developer, I&#x27;d much rather delegate that responsibility away to a packager or even the user, especially with well-known libraries like openssl.<p>If I&#x27;m owning AWESOMY 1.1 and link dynamically against openssl, then I don&#x27;t have to do anything when openssl releases a security announcement. I can, if I want to, inform my users to maybe update openssl, but with some likelihood they are already doing this anyways for some other package.<p>For me as a developer, this is considerably more convenient.<p>Yes.

So Dieter Rams minimalism is very much a visual language and owes a great deal to art deco and the bauhaus.<p>But design doesn&#x27;t always have to be useful. For example the work that a game designer does is all about distraction and entertainment, and has little to do with making things understandable. In fact game design is about creating problems for people more than anything else at times.<p>I&#x27;d also be wary of the fashion to bash fashion and the decorative arts: A good knowledge of the decorative arts and art history are critical if you want to be a good designer. And I would also add to that a good designer should be a well rounded person as well: You should know a little bit about theater, literature, music and many other things.<p>The real failure I see is that many lesser engineers think that they can sprinkle some design on what they&#x27;re doing.

For POSIX, using a combination of setjmp(), longjmp(), sigaltstack(), and some signal (e.g. SIGUSR2) will provide coroutine support though it is &quot;pretty awful&quot;. While it is &quot;horrible&quot;, it does actually work.<p>I do this, and it works perfectly well. Here&#x27;s a full implementation demonstrating this approach: <a href=""https://gitlab.com/higan/higan/blob/master/libco/sjlj.c"" rel=""nofollow"">https://gitlab.com/higan/higan/blob/master/libco/sjlj.c</a><p>It&#x27;s been successfully used on x86, amd64, ppc32, ppc64, mips, arm and sparc in several projects.<p>However, it still has a good bit of overhead. But you can implement this concept absolutely trivially on any platform for maximum speed. All you need to do is save the non-volatile registers, swap the stack pointer, restore the non-volatile registers from the swapped-in stack, and return from the function. If you haven&#x27;t realized, one function can reciprocally save and restore these contexts. Here&#x27;s an x86 implementation, for example:<p><pre><code>    co_swap: ;ecx = new thread, edx = old thread
    mov [edx],esp
    mov esp,[ecx]
    pop eax  ;faster than ret (CPU begins caching new opcodes here)
    mov [edx+4],ebp  ;much faster than push/pop on AMD CPUs
    mov [edx+8],esi
    mov [edx+12],edi
    mov [edx+16],ebx
    mov ebp,[ecx+4]
    mov esi,[ecx+8]
    mov edi,[ecx+12]
    mov ebx,[ecx+16]
    jmp eax
</code></pre>
This turns out to be several times faster than abusing setjmp/longjmp.<p>I turned this into the simplest possible library called libco (public domain or ISC, whichever you prefer.) The entire API is four functions, taking 0-2 arguments each: create, delete, active, switch.<p>The work&#x27;s already been done for several processors. Plus there&#x27;s backends for the setjmp trick, Windows Fibers and even the slow-as-snails makecontext.<p>If Python does decide to go this route, I&#x27;d certainly appreciate if the devs could be directed at libco for consideration. It&#x27;d save them a lot of trouble making these, and it&#x27;d get us some much-needed notoriety so that we could produce more backends and finally have a definitive cothreading library.",1429078913

When evidence can be used in court to convict persons of crimes, it must be handled in a scrupulously careful manner to prevent tampering or contamination. The idea behind recording the chain of custody is to establish that the alleged evidence is in fact related to the alleged crime, rather than having, for example, been “planted” fraudulently to make someone appear guilty.<p>Regarding other comments in this thread about law enforcement being held to a higher standard, they would be.  The higher standard is that when they fail to follow proper procedure like this, the effect is the evidence (and often the entire case) is summerly dismissed, and the defendant cannot be tried again for the same crime. the entire US legal system has this built in bias.  Whereas a defendant in a similar position of supplying discovery documents would not be held to the same standard risking summery judgement, and might be able to provide replacement copies for discovery, and continue with the definse more or less normally.<p>1: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chain_of_custody"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chain_of_custody</a>",1429078867

It&#x27;s that people use booleans when they mean &quot;something that has two choices&quot;, they&#x27;re too lazy to enumerate what those choices are, and most crucially, it cannot be easily inferred from context what the boolean argument means.<p>It&#x27;s perfectly fine if your function takes a boolean argument where the parameter either means &quot;TRUE&quot; or &quot;FALSE&quot;: EnableThing(bool) is self-descriptive (as long as passing TRUE enables the thing... too many APIs fall victim to this total failure as well).<p>The real problem is when you start using booleans where you lose the meaning. Mapping boolean to things that take on similar meanings { 0, 1 }, { NO, YES }, { OFF, ON }, and maybe stretching it a bit, { BLACK, WHITE } is probably okay as long as it is clearly spelled out what the flag is doing, and likely it should be the only parameter to the function (and definitely not when there are multiple flags, and especially definitely not when those flags have some interaction). Mapping boolean to { PURPLE, YELLOW }, { LEFT TO RIGHT, RIGHT TO LEFT }, or { SYNCHRONOUS, ASYNCHRONOUS } is asking for people to misuse your API, and worse - painting yourself into the corner when it comes time to handle BLUE, TOP TO BOTTOM, or ISOSYNCHRONOUS. In many of these cases, you&#x27;re far better off just throwing in the ten second enum. (&quot;Functions are cheap&quot; is true for applications, but it&#x27;s categorically false for libraries, especially those that must stand up to the test of time, so I would definitely stick to the enum - types really are cheap.)<p>His given example is definitely an example of doing it wrong, but I have a better one that I come across every day at my job:<p><pre><code>   gtk_box_pack_start (Box, Widget, bool expand, bool fill, int padding);
</code></pre>
#1. Two boolean flags, so you <i>must</i> remember the ordering, or look it up every time.<p>#2. One boolean <i>changes the behavior of the other.</i> We don&#x27;t have a complete mapping; only three of the four states are meaningful.<p>#3. The API is not expressive enough to tell you what expand/fill mean without looking at the documentation, so you have to &quot;do the matrix&quot; and start seeing blonde, brunette, redhead by memorizing the order of the flags.<p>An enumeration would tell you immediately, and be roughly as character efficient as &quot;FALSE, FALSE&quot;, &quot;TRUE, FALSE&quot; or &quot;TRUE, TRUE&quot;:<p><pre><code>    enum GtkBoxPackingOptions
    {
       PACK_SHRINK,

First, there&#x27;s a spark gap between the antenna and ground, with big metal contacts, copper or silver, a short distance apart. That diverts most of the lightning bolt to ground. Then the feed line for the antenna has a big inductor, a coil made of heavy busbar, usually in a grounded can. This is often placed through the wall of a grounded metal equipment enclosure.<p>The inductance blocks a fast risetime lightning bolt, forcing the energy to the spark gap.  A few hundred volts will still get through that.  So following that there&#x27;s a gas tube protector, which is essentially a neon tube which will ionize and short to ground.  (Phone lines also have those at the central office end.)  Following that is a MOV, as in a surge suppressor, to dump the remaining surge into ground.

The issue is that reference counted types can have cycles, which are never destroyed, so placing the token in a reference counted cycle will stop the destructor running and hence risks unsafety.<p>It&#x27;s fairly non-trivial to achieve this unsafety, but even the slightest risk is not acceptable for safe functions in the standard library, so we aren&#x27;t going to ship it as is.<p>Fortunately, there are a few ways we can adjust things so that the interaction between reference counting and scoped threads doesn&#x27;t cause problems, e.g. modify the reference counted types so that they cannot store types that require that the destructor be run like the `scoped` token, or guarantee safety in a way that doesn&#x27;t hinge on the destructor of an object the user has ownership of.",1429077685

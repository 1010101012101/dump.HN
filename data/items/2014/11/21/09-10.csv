Parole in this type of circumstance would allow theseindividuals to temporarily pursue research and development ofpromising new ideas and businesses in the United States, rather than abroad.

Secondly, the last official statement still stands, No hard compile time dep on systemd for “basic functionality”. This is a bit vague but think of session tracking as basic functionality.&quot;<p>It&#x27;s now the position of the systemd developers that running logind without systemd was never supported, and that distros like Ubuntu should never have tried to do it. I believe they&#x27;ve now broken the ability to do so. It&#x27;s one of the major reasons Ubuntu had to switch to systemd.<p>(Oh, and for some context, <a href=""http://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/systemd/logind/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/systemd/logind/</a> is the logind DBUS API.

But other than some minor cosmetic changes, <i>and largely invisible-to-the-user under-the-hood updates</i>, the <i>visible</i> UI has NOT changed appreciably.<p>Contrast that with the disruption that&#x27;s prevailed in the Microsoft Windows and Linux spaces from 1999 to present.

8640553,comment,8637186,8637186,0,0,daniel-levin,,,"This book interesting because it forgoes the traditional approach of most mathematical statistics books. The preface states that it is done like this in order to avoid the &quot;cookbook&quot; approach taken by many statistics students. This is why it is ironic that &quot;Bayes&#x27; Recipe&quot; appears 15 times in this text, and on page 131 there is a five step algorithm for parameter estimation, and my favourite, oft-repeated, never explained recipe - &quot;n > 30, you&#x27;ll be fine&quot;. There is no mention of the CLT, MLE, method of moments estimation, biasedness of estimators, convergence in probability, how sampling distributions arise, or any of the theory of distributions that underpin all of the inferential procedures detailed in the book. I think that excluding these topics actually increases the cookbooky-ness of the text.<p>It is important that students understand the provenance of the inferential techniques they use so that they don&#x27;t land up doing bogus science (which hurts the world) by not knowing the failure modes of these techniques. Of course not all students of statistics know the requisite mathematics to understand it all, at the very least put the failure modes into a cookbook form.<p>For the sake of science please don&#x27;t ever do any inferential statistics without knowing when the method you&#x27;re using works and when it breaks, what it is robust to, and what assumptions it makes. Statistics is really easy to break when used naively. The mathematics of statistics is not easy, and often results are highly counter-intuitive.",1416563482

Moving to a system &quot;outside of capitalism&quot; involves preventing this, and necessarily involves large scale violence both to take the accumulated capital of savers and to persecute anyone who still seeks to engage in the free exchange of goods. See for example the merchants in Maoist China and Stalinist Russia who were hung or shot for being capitalist traitors, and the landowners who were exiled or killed.

8640475,comment,8638252,8638252,0,0,rfergie,,,"hvass has covered a list of general tips - here are some SAAS specific ones that might be really useful for HN readers.<p>It is very important that you understand and measure your customer lifetime value. Estimate this value too low and you won&#x27;t be competitive in the auction (this is a big deal if you have aggressive growth targets). Estimate too high and you will lose money. And you won&#x27;t even realise you are losing money until 6-8 months later when it becomes apparent you got the CLV wrong.<p>There will be high volume &quot;I want to buy this now!&quot; keywords which all of your competition will be after like crazy. Winning in these auctions requires a decent click through rate and a high click value. The good click through rate is required because it will give you a good quality score which leads to a lower cost per click; you will need this discount to be competitive unless your CLV is way ahead of the competition (which realistically it won&#x27;t be). You need a high click value otherwise you can&#x27;t afford to be at the top of the auction.<p>You will generally find that there will be things you can say in ad texts that will get you an excellent CTR. Things like &quot;Free&quot; or specifically mentioning pain points for your audience might work well. Your business model must be able to support these things otherwise you will get the click through rate but not get the click value if you can&#x27;t match the proposition in the advert with your landing page. Figuring out and implementing these hooks requires a strong link between product and marketing so it is textbook growth hacker territory. It is really the only way to dominate the top of the auction with long term profitability.<p>There will be many other search queries that do not signal the intent to purchase right away. &quot;How do I&quot; or &quot;What&quot; queries often fall into this category. Tracking the value of clicks on these queries is harder because the actual value happens many visits/months in the future. For this reason PPC managers at your competition may underbid on these keywords which gives you an opportunity. The risk is, of course, that in your enthusiasm you will overbid and end up losing money. So the keys to managing this kind of keyword well are to improve tracking and to increase the value of a click on these keywords. Both of these are facilitated by making the primary call to action on the landing page for this type of query an email capture. Having an email address gives you a way to link up an eventual purchase AND a way to increase CLV because you can email market to the prospect.<p>AdWords for SAAS is a nerve-wracking games compared to e.g. AdWords for ecommerce. In ecom the product is sold fairly quickly and since AdWords payments can be made net 30 cashflow can always be positive. For SAAS this is completely not the case - the acquisition cost for a new user won&#x27;t be paid back for many months and it is easy for businesses to end up in a hole. But in a business environment driven by investors and the need for rapid growth being too conservative in PPC has other undesirable consequences.<p>Quick sum up:<p>- The mechanics of AdWords is fairly simple - match the users query to a keyword. Show them the right ad text and landing page. Make sure you pay the right amount for a click<p>- Integrating AdWords into a business is harder and may require changes to the business model (to support the kind of proposition that performs well in search)<p>- Work on conversion rate optimisation and on increasing the value of a click; if you can do this better than the competition (which is hard - don&#x27;t assume they are stupid) then the AdWords part will be quite easy; you don&#x27;t need to stress about your CPA when you are at the top of the auction and you know you are well below your ceiling. You do need to stress about your CPA when you are in position 3 and increasing CPA by $20 will put you in position 1.",1416561445

Companies cannot afford to support Windows Server, Linux AND another flavor of UNIX (FreeBSD). They are already dumping Solaris/AIX/HP-UX as much as they can so environments are a bit more homogeneous (and easier to support). There is no point in onboarding FreeBSD for what they perceive as minor technical differences (that, truth be told, are overshadowed by dozens of layers of bureaucracy and any efficiency benefit is completely lost).<p>It took a long time and a giant ecosystem to get where Linux is today at big enterprises. OSes are commodities in that space. They are not commodities in many other spaces though (e.g. startups, HPC, science, etc).",1416561052

The vast majority of &quot;startups&quot; never achieve high growth, and venture firms reject far more companies than they fund. If you have a great business worth funding, no institutional investor is going to walk because you may need to revisit entity selection.<p>> I&#x27;d also just point out that telling people to just incorporate in their state of residence is no less boilerplate advice than telling people to incorporate in Delaware :)<p>I didn&#x27;t advise that founders incorporate in their state of residence. I stated that this is the <i>simplest</i> option. And it is. That doesn&#x27;t mean there aren&#x27;t situations in which the simplest option is not the best option, but if you&#x27;re going to rule out the simplest option, you should understand why doing so makes sense.",1416561004

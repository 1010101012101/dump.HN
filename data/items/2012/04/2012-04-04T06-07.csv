You can protect against all possible input vectors by using placeholders. Constructing SQL queries with string formatting or concatenation should be avoided. When executing bulk queries it is also more efficient.<p><pre><code>  $stmt = $dbh->prepare(""SELECT user,password FROM admins WHERE user=? AND password=? AND ip_adr=?"");

The information that was used to judge Intel's solution was based only on press releases and not any practical working knowledge.<p><pre><code>  ""We can no longer reduce voltage in proportion to transistor size""

The ""we"" here refers to Nvidia, and not Intel, because Nvidia uses TSMC to fab their GPU chips.<p><pre><code>  ""there is no such thing as a magic compiler that will
  automatically parallelize your code""

That is funny because Nvidia's newest GPU design offloads scheduling decisions on to the compiler instead of handling it dynamically on-core.<p>So perhaps Nvidia is warming up the FUD machines because of their newest range of GPUs which focus on gaming at the expense of computing.<p>eg. the Double Precision FLOP/s is now less than 10% of the Single Precision FLOP/s performance",1333522063

With data formats we're basically where we've been with ""scripting"" languages for years: we can afford to start with the highest possible level and trickle down towards compiled code only where necessary.<p>Further, whenever I've ever had to create a binary format I've written a translator first. The translator is a program that can read the binary format and write the same information out in editable text form, and that can also parse the text and write out the equivalent binary. Then I only work and debug using the text format and just convert to binary when needed.<p>Usually this approach implies defining an API that you can use to construct the text or binary message. The API becomes automatically tested when I start by working with the text representation and when I finally move on to writing natively binary only (for performance reasons, obviously), I can trust that it works as well as during development. And I can use the API to generate text, too, so I can easily compare and see what's going on.",1333520021

I used the ""six months"" example to illustrate that the shopping cart is persistent, but the machine crash could just as easily happen the moment before you push ""checkout.""  Losing shopping cart data just because one machine crashed is totally unacceptable.<p>Programming distributed systems that must survive machine failure and network partitions is a completely different ball of wax compared to simple web programming.  If you haven't done it before, you would not believe how much more complicated it is.<p>Here is an extremely simple example.  Suppose you're a radio station that's taking phone calls from people and you want to give an award to the 5th caller.  Implementing a program that does this for a single machine is easy, and could be accomplished with a program something like this:<p><pre><code>  import SocketServer

  class MyHandler(SocketServer.BaseRequestHandler):
    def handle(self):
      self.server.caller += 1
      if self.server.caller == 5:
        self.request.sendall(""Congratulations, you are the 5th caller!\n"")
      else:
        self.request.sendall(""Sorry, you're caller #%d\n"" % (self.server.caller))

  server = SocketServer.TCPServer((""localhost"", 9999), MyHandler)
  server.caller = 0
  server.serve_forever()
</code></pre>
Using this program, you can ""call"" the program by doing ""telnet localhost 9999"" and the program will tell you what caller you are.  This took me about 5 minutes to write, and I'd never used this Python API before.<p>Now imagine that you want to implement this same logic, but using a cluster of machines that could go down at any time.  You want the group of machines to form ""consensus"" about which number each caller is; consensus in this context just means that the group of machines arrives at a single answer, and any machine you ask will give you the same answer.<p>Finding an algorithm that can do this robustly is so difficult that it was a major breakthrough when one was discovered in 1988.  It's called Paxos and you can read about it here: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paxos_(computer_science)"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paxos_(computer_science)</a>  Even though it has been known for over 20 years, it is still a complex topic that very few people understand the details of.<p>The point of all of this is just to say; you can't compare a single-process in-memory cache to a distributed and fault-tolerant system.  They are completely different beasts, and many business problems do indeed need the latter.",1333519625

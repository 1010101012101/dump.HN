601948,comment,601018,601550,0,0,jonny_noog,,,"<i>what kinda koolaid is the aussie government drinking?</i><p>Let me try and explain what koolaid they're drinking: I believe the real reason the Australian Government is pushing this plan so hard in spite of massive opposition from industry and the general public is they need support from a couple of minor party/independent senators in order to pass basically any controversial legislation. These senators represent social conservative special interest groups who have strong objections to things like gambling and adult (legal) pornography. In this case, we're talking about the online versions of these things.<p>It has little do to with protecting the children (that's just the cover) or anything else other than good old political manoeuvring. The whole situation is probably not helped by the fact that the current left-wing Australian Government is by and large, about as conservative as you can get and still be called left-wing. But I think it's mainly that they need support from outside their own party if they really want to get anything done.",1241945856

I find very alluring the possibility of mixing and matching languages according to the task at hand without having to deal with IPC.<p>I could really find usages for actor-based concurrency, but using Erlang seems to me like throwing the baby out with the bathwater.",1241945764

601941,comment,601408,601517,0,0,RiderOfGiraffes,,,"That's possibly a better way of phrasing it - thank you.  Crypto is notoriously difficult, and it's clearly prudent to wait and see what others say, and how it works.<p>It actually misses my intended point, though.  This forum is generally exceptional in the quality of its submissions and comments, which is what makes it even more annoying when someone says:<p><pre><code>    I don't know this guy. Probably he is really
    famous (?), but ...
</code></pre>
This amounts to saying ""I don't know what I'm talking about, and I'm not going to bother doing any homework before making my ignorance known to you all ...""",1241945194

You can't know if you have a winner or a loser until you've been all-in on it for a little while.<p>Pick the one you can stand to spend every working hour on for a few years (assuming it proves a workable idea, and you see a path forward at each milestone you reach along the way), and forget about everything else.<p><i>Every</i> nerd has a lot of ideas.  You are not unique.  The difference between you and the ones who succeed is that they commit to something and go all-in.

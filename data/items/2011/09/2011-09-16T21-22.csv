3006483,comment,3005831,3005831,8,0,slowpoke,,,"I've been a GNU/Linux user for a bit over a year now, I think. Started out with Ubuntu 10.04 dual booted with Windows, then completely ditched Microsoft in favor of the better operating system some when in January. A bit later, after getting bugged by a good friend and fellow hacker on IRC for a while, I finally set out to install Arch, and got hooked.<p>Arch Linux can, in my experience, best be described as a journey. A journey to the top of a mountain. It starts steep, sometimes gets hazardous, and I fell down more then once and had to start climbing from the start. But with every time, it became easier as I got to know the mountain, and set out with new knowledge about the steps and stones, as they were aligned perfectly for climbing once you knew how to climb them.<p>Then finally, I reached the first peak - a custom, running and stable install - and just as you might hold your breath at the sight presented to you when you look down from the top of the mountain you just climbed, I felt kind of serene - I learned so much about my system during the installation, how it worked and how elegantly simple it was once you understood it's philosophy, it was overwhelming.<p>I knew I arrived at a place where I wanted to stay. Or rather, a place from where I could climb even higher mountains - because the Arch journey is probably never at its end. There's always something more to learn about the system - my system. Something to tweak, somewhere to hack around or some configuration to customize for my needs.<p>I won't say I'll stay with it forever, as in the world of GNU/Linux, one might always discover something new. I will say, however, that installing (and subsequently running) Arch was (and still is) one of the best and most rewarding things I've done in my life.<p>To anyone who is interested in learning new stuff and doing things on his or her own, I warmly recommend trying out Arch. You shall not be disappointed.",1316210118

I agree it is hard ...<p>Good news is that for the ""known/commont stuff"" you can always have a central database of the random/temp stuff they generate.<p>E.g., mysql generetes tmp files here and there, and so and so - so you could profile all that common stuff in that way.<p>Then the uncommon stuff or your custom things, you declaratively say ""do not track"" as you do with code today.<p>Moreover you can do it in a way that is crowdsourced - ie: if its a cloud service when people declare such and such in mongodb is random/temp then you learn for all users.<p>At the end of the day there is a limited number of things people use and for the long tail it is OK for people to be declarative I guess.<p>But on the flip side I can see how that could end up being a nightmare.<p>But wouldn't it be nice to do something as simple as pull/commit/push for general purpose computers?",1316210098

Like many people, I previously used Ubuntu, but grew fed up with the focus of their development efforts on areas which I considered to be inconsequential. Seeing the direction that Ubuntu has taken since then, I'm glad I made that decision when I did.<p>For me, the best thing about Arch is simply how flexible it is. It feels more like a toolkit for building your own custom OS than anything else. That's obviously not for everyone, but it's definitely for me. I've got a trimmed-down, keyboard-driven, and CLI-focused interface that would not appeal to the average user, but it was fun to configure and I've learned a ton from the experience. My computer behaves exactly the way I want it to, with virtually no compromises, and that was a far easier goal to attain with Arch than with any other system I've tried.<p>Also, as a bonus for anyone interested in Haskell, there's a rather large Haskell community within the Arch community. In fact, there's a vast user-maintained repository of Haskell packages built for Arch (a large portion of the packages available from Hackage) which you can enable just by adding a line to /etc/pacman.d/mirrorlist.<p>For anyone who likes to tweak and tinker, and who loves having full control over their computing experience, I highly recommend it.",1316208907

3006333,comment,3005557,3006067,5,0,strlen,,,"> Basically, in SV, you can get 150K salary with 20 years experience and PhD only at Facebook, Google, Oracle, etc.<p>Absolutely false. If you've got 20 years experience and a Ph.D and are getting $150k at Google, you're getting seriously screwed (a senior/staff SWE is makes more in base + year-end bonus + RSUs). If you're at Facebook, you're still probably making more in _base_ and (again) get RSUs and bonuses worth something.<p>Outside of these companies, there are tons hiring -- especially for mid-career folks. In fact, Google is a great place for folks early in their career, but they have issues hiring mid-career folks (but they've been getting better about it).<p>My advice is, know something other than ""read text from a database and display it on the screen"". Writing basic business/consumer CRUD applications is a solved problem. Yes, it used to be that one would have to use C/C++ and much ""tricky"" programming to reliably do this (I still remember how complex CRM, ERP and CMS packages from the 1990s were!), but that's not the case now. Nowadays this involves stringing several open source / commercial libraries together, rather than actually building core technology. Not only is building these applications a solved problem, for non-software companies it's actually more beneficial to purchase and customize these applications rather than build their own.<p>I remember reading stories (in Coders at Work, I believe) where a young programmer working for a hospital (building a record keeping system) had to code/debug assembly. These days he'll be lucky to write a few lines of PHP, but most likely will just end up customizing an existing EMR system.<p>If you want your programming ability to be an asset you can leverage, there are two ways: you can be a systems/networking/distributed systems developer, or you can learn a topic like computer vision, AI/machine learning/NLP. In first case you should know C, C++, socket programming, distributed systems and (for few companies) general JVM basics (garbage collection, performance) like the back of your hand (this is something you can still do to a large extent on your own time). In the second case, you should be sure to have a solid grasp of the Computer Science / Math / Stats involved.<p>Both of these are applicable in many areas: from finance, to highly scalable web applications, to stand-alone products (web browsers require a lot of systems programming chops, there is also data mining software, enterprise search, security/spam prevention...). You don't need a Ph.D for both of these, and (unfortunately) outside of Google, Oracle, Facebook and a few other companies (that have a healthy relationship with the academia) a Ph.D. is considered a negative. They do require persistence, passion and willingness to invest time and take risks: taking jobs in companies willing to take a risk _on you_  by giving you challenges and responsibilities.",1316207428

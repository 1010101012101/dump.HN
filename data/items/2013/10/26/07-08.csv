6616728,comment,6616019,6616254,2,0,cbsmith,,,"Privileged ports isn&#x27;t an example of security through security. Maybe you could call it security by convention. Still, it relies on a <i>number</i> of assumptions, none of which can be relied upon if a system is compromised, and if the system isn&#x27;t compromised... well, you don&#x27;t have a problem now do you?<p>Honestly, the only win of a using &quot;privileged ports&quot; these days is you don&#x27;t have to worry about the odds of some other service randomly binding to your port. Since most systems spin up ssh well before they spin up services that bind to random ports, and generally don&#x27;t ever shut down ssh, that isn&#x27;t much a win, but either way, it is NOT a _security_ win.",1382774295

At the time of mentioned geniuses people were just starting to tend away from the faith in god, so the faith in higher powers partially persisted, and labeling people with great achievements as &quot;geniuses&quot; and making it feel like they have something others don&#x27;t felt like a common sense and intuitive thing to do. So the &quot;genius&quot; might just be a temporary placeholder for the void that left when god was gone. As the void shrank with time, because the religion lost influence and people got better education, the need for people to have something greater then them, i.e. &quot;geniuses&quot; shrank too.",1382773830

Bit at least a couple of friends I know.<p>From a <i>technical</i> point of view I can certainly approve the change. Back in my time I&#x27;ve had couple of my images ruined by badly timed save (user error [tm]), so the non-destructive approach certainly has its merits. However, the new behaviour breaks a lot of ingrained casual use flows. So maybe the best approach would for Gimp to remember the original filename when it&#x27;s opened and if the filetype is anything <i>except</i> XCF, simply do two saves: create a new $filename.xcf automatically with all the changes the user has made, and also auto-export with the old name.<p>That way the more casual users could still just do &quot;open, edit, save&quot; for their quick edits. As a bonus, since the XCF file is non-destructive, the original file would still be in there. This might give the best of both worlds: it wouldn&#x27;t break existing workflows, and it would automatically prevent accidentally changing the original image. Plus it would make the save/export split less of a headache for new users.<p>Just an idea.",1382772345

To understand physics in those regimes, we need a consistent way to put together gravity and quantum mechanics.<p>The explanation that gravity corresponds to the physics of the large scales and quantum mechanics to the physics of small scales is not quite true -- this description applies in our daily experience, but is not always the case.",1382771592

The situation cannot be ignored because it hints that the phenomena may not be properly understood.<p>The equations of general relativity do not hold on the quantum scale, and those of quantum mechanics cannot be used when gravity is large. This is a break down. The bridge between the two could be unifying the two \n&quot;worlds&quot; or have a damn good reason why not. Nature has a good motivator for unifying called black-holes. Inside black-holes you have large gravity and also quantum scale stuff that has been eaten or squished together or just tiny space.<p>It would be rather difficult to solve the black-hole problem starting from scratch, as black-holes arise out of general relativity equations. So you start from quantum scale and cross-check with the other end or vice versa.<p>If you are weary of the word &quot;unify&quot; from a philosophical perspective, then it may help to realize that the word unify comes to apply because we (humanity) have discovered and built up more knowledge from imperfect bundles.<p>Suppose in 1906 (before quantum mechanics or general relativity) Einstein had come up with some universal theory/model that inherently worked everywhere, it probably would never have been termed as a unification theory.",1382771053

If its IPS or some S-PVA/P-MVA doesn&#x27;t matter. Maybe take a look at different panels in a shop. I am personally very happy with my MVA-Panel monitor because of the good black levels. Try to avoid glare panels AND glare frames around the panel.<p>Next, make sure the monitor can be adjusted, not only in height but also tilt. I found that really useful adjusting the monitor to my seating position.<p>Regarding eye strain, the most common cause of this is setting the monitor backlight too high. Especially with LED backlights. Even in a normal lit room I only have set the backlight to around 10%. You may need to get adjusted to this first if you are used to normal settings (e.g. the default settings of the monitor which are always way too high), but for me it helped great deal with eye strain and headaches.",1382770941

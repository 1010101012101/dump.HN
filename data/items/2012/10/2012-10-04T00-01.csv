Considering my tastes are pretty mainstream and my files have very clean tags, it's hardly impressive.""<p>For comparison, iTunes Match launched not long after that. More than half of my library was matched without uploading, and by that point it had grown to 21679 songs. Honestly, since iTunes Match I haven't even considered a cloud music service like Spotify or Rdio again.

Anchor links are a technical solution, but that's not how normal citations work.<p>I think that more generally when a document becomes sufficiently complex it is better to use a page-oriented, typesetting approach. You'll want to fiddle with where certain page breaks and figures end up, and if you do that you might as well stick with one canonical format.<p>You can view it as the paper paradigm. Alternatively, you can also see it as sticking to a uniform, canonical format. Getting fluid layouts right is a very difficult problem, and manually getting the layout right for a fixed format is simply a much better solution for this purpose.",1349311589

It should be noted that there aren't newspaper articles praising increases in the prices of food, gas or clothing, but there are for house prices.  Heck increasing house prices are mentioned in the context of politicians and giving them credit for doing such good things (hence my wording of ""triumph"").<p>I don't know why you think the housing market is a free market.  If it was then this headline would not be possible ""Obama policies ended housing free fall"".  And what about all the tax credits - not a free market.  And what about the government pseudo agencies (Fannie/Freddie) - again not a free market.  Planning permissions and zoning regulations are also part of the discussion about a free market.  Even relocation allowance being taxable or not is an issue.  I'd be far happier with an actual free market rather than one favoured by tax and similar policies with the goal of increasing the prices and hence taking money away from other things.  (I also believe in a separate social safety net - all residents should have shelter, food, health and justice.)<p>Back to my original point, which scenario do you think is better for a household taking home $4,000 a month - one where they spend $1 of that on housing or where they spend $2,500 of that on housing?

Artists had a patron, either the leader of the state or the duke of Weimar or somewhere, or the church, the pope. Or they had another job. I have another job. I make films. No one tells me what to do. But I make the money in the wine industry. You work another job and get up at five in the morning and write your script.
This idea of Metallica or some rock n roll singer being rich, thats not necessarily going to happen anymore. Because, as we enter into a new age, maybe art will be free. Maybe the students are right. They should be able to download music and movies. Im going to be shot for saying this. But who said art has to cost money? And therefore, who says artists have to make money?
In the old days, 200 years ago, if you were a composer, the only way you could make money was to travel with the orchestra and be the conductor, because then youd be paid as a musician. There was no recording. There were no record royalties. So I would say, Try to disconnect the idea of cinema with the idea of making a living and money.

4610262,comment,4607606,4609971,6,0,vidarh,,,"(this wall of text brought to you by procrastination)<p>Canada allows appealing not guilty verdicts.<p>Also Norway, which is the system I know best, as do a substantial number of other European states, including e.g. Germany, France.<p>Norway (and most other European countries) do have forms of double jeopardy protection, but in Norway as in many other European countries as well as Canada, it does not attach until the case has been fully litigated and all appeals exhausted. Instead it prevents the government from bringing the case again once the case is _final_.<p>In Norway, the system has three levels. In criminal cases the lower court usually hear cases with a panel of three co-judges, two of which are lay persons selected from the jury pool. They  deliberate together, and so nullification is effectively impossible at this stage as the professional judge can set aside a majority decision by the two lay judges voting together if their decision is a clear misapplication of the law. This right is used, but not frequently, given that the professional judge obviously in this system has ample opportunity to discuss the issue with the lay judges.<p>The higher court (lagmannsretten) will in more serious cases have three professional judges and a separate jury like in the US. In this case, nullification would be possible, but if the three professional judges unanimously believe that the evidence clearly indicates guilt, they can still set aside the jury decision. If they set it aside, the case is then retried at the same level without a jury, but with lay judges as in tingretten.<p>The last step is the supreme court, which only hears matters of law in the case of criminal cases, so in criminal cases an acquittal on matters of fact after (at worst) a second trial in lagmannsretten is almost certain to stand. As in the US, once the supreme court has either heard a case or refused to hear it (or neither side has appealed to the supreme court), the case is final. This is the point where double jeopardy attaches in Norway (there may be some very narrow exceptions, I'm not sure).<p>> Am I understanding correctly that the fact that nullification occurred would be grounds for an appeal in those jurisdictions?<p>I'm not a lawyer, but in general my understanding is that nullification _if proven_ would be grounds for appeal in any situation where an appeal is allowed pretty much everywhere, including in the US in civil cases.<p>This is also presumably the reason why we rarely hear about nullification outside the context of US criminal trials, because if/when it occurs it would need to be subtle and nobody on such a jury could really talk about it afterwards.<p>The problem in bringing an appeal in such cases is that given that the jury deliberations are private, substantiating appeals on such grounds can be extremely hard.<p>E.g. in the Apple vs. Samsung case a lot of Samsungs allegation of jury misconduct hinges on the fact that the foreman and at least one other juror (were there more?) have kept giving interviews and saying more and more things about the deliberations that are seemingly at odds with the instructions.<p>> My thought here is that in jurisdictions where jury nullification is normally possible and effective, it is only really effective if they give a not guilty verdict. A guilty verdict, given ""just because"" (or whatever), could be overturned in those jurisdictions, possibly even immediately by the judge.<p>You're right, it is vastly more powerful when the decision can't be appealed because they have the freedom to totally ignore evidence and instructions.<p>It can still happen in other situations, but it needs to at least be nominally possible to arrive at their decision while staying within the jury instructions which of course often will remove the opportunity to nullify in the type of clear-cut cases where nullification is most effectively used as a protest against unjust laws.",1349309162

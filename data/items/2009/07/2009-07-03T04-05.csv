For example, if a totally hypothetical individual developed a collaborative knowledge-base system and offered it as a service, they might decide to arbitrarily segment the market based on page views.<p>Now, one might make the argument that there is actually a cost associated with page views whereas there is not a cost with having your software recognize all the memory on a third party's machine, but just between us businessmen we can agree that that is malarky.  For one, the cost of a marginal pageview is too small to be measured but the price to the customer of that page view is about ten thousand dollars in the first year if it was their millionth-and-first page view in January.  For another, the cost the 9 million page views separating tier #2 of the hypothetical service from tier #1 is far, far less than the pricing differential.",1246596700

685630,comment,680578,685451,0,0,sho,,,"Well, we're obviously unable to estimate the probabilities accurately, but from what I know of the subject 0.002% is exceedingly pessimistic. I am no expert, but do follow this stuff, and IMO the chances are actually pretty good. And the payoff, if successful, is basically infinity.<p>The Harris essay (on the Amcor site) you linked to, by the way, I have many problems with. It purports to take a scientific approach to estimating the probably of success and yet has many inexplicable red herrings that bring down the final total, for example a fanciful excursion into numerous world disaster scenarios which, while entertaining, are pretty tangential to the question at hand. Other ""risks"" he factors in, like the company going out of business or the storage becoming illegal in that country, are not related to the technology per se and would be handled by the suspendee's descendents or trustees - they are only reasonable if one assumes a complete lack of preparation for the execution of your wishes, and a complete lack of action by your living representatives if you had. They do not belong in the final estimate either. I would take his ""optimistic"" estimate and multiply it by three, or more.<p>The cost is somewhere around $250k. That's not insignificant but certainly not out of reach for many, especially in their old age. What else would you do with the money? Even if it's unsuccessful, at least you're capitalising companies doing research for the good of the species. And what's the alternative? Certain oblivion, rotting in the ground, with the money going to general revenue?<p>When the payoff is infinity it is rational to take any non-zero bet, and the entry price is not even that high. I'll be taking that bet. Don't know why you're so down on it really.",1246596105

Get good advice (from the department) for the courses that you want to take and go for those. Don't be a fool signing up for Measure Theory before you're comfortable with calculus, though.<p>long version :<p>The best reason I can think of NOT to do it is that you'll be doing a few interesting courses compared to the interesting ones.<p>I did a bachelor's degree in math and a master's degree right after (Number Theory, yay !). In all the undergrad years, the most interesting courses were the introductory courses to ""Real Analysis"" and ""Group/Ring Theory"". ""Complex Analysis"" was pretty awesome too, but not as eye-opening as the two previous ones.<p>The program had a lot of padding. I had to take introductory courses to computer science. The data structure class was also an eye-opening experience, but the 5 other mandatory CS courses were boring.<p>After doing all the math stuff, I want to study artificial intelligence so I went to some other place as a non-classified student. I studied full-time there, took 5 courses each term, but got no diploma for that year. What happened after that is not relevant to the story. The point is, I took a lot of very interesting courses because I wasn't limited by what some committee decided should be the school curriculum for an undergrad degree in math. If you don't need the diploma, you don't have to follow the department rules. You can always register for specific courses and take those. I had a 55 year old marine officer registered in my Real Analysis class. He was a pretty fun guy, but he had some problems following the material. He was doing a better job than most undergrads, though.<p>An about online lessons, people underestimate the value that you're getting by being able to dialog with the professor during class. It's not just about being motivated by being forced to do the exercises, it's about being able to ask your algebra prof ""why on Earth would I want to diagonalize a matrix !?"" and getting a good answer to that.<p>There are certain key insights to be had while learning math and it's very helpful to be able to check with a prof who knows the material well. Some of the theory in mathematics in presented backwards. If you have hindsight, you know what they're trying to achieve and you can see why it makes sense to start where the book starts. If don't know the destination, it's harder to follow the proof when they don't seem to be going in any direction.",1246595691

685614,comment,685565,685605,0,0,barrkel,,,"A GC wouldn't be able to auto-recreate the object without either an indirection (and thus no better than using a weak reference in a kind of smart pointer), or rather costly logic.<p>Suppose an instantiated object is 512K in size. You've got a reference to it from 50 places. The GC decides to evict it but still has the construction logic which, say, takes up 128 bytes. All the 50 references now need to be updated, but what will they point to? Presumably some kind of proxy or stub which, when touched, inflates to the size of the original object.<p>The problem is that this thing can't inflate in-place, otherwise it wouldn't actually be saving any address space. So, the re-instantiation must occur somewhere else, and 50 locations need to be updated. Since a GC isn't currently in flight, <i>finding</i> those 50 locations is going to be very expensive. It's going to have a similar cost to the mark phase of a GC.<p>The best approach for the GC would be to use an indirection, to treat all references to evictable objects as smart pointers of some kind, with an extra indirection between the reference and the object which may or may not have to be re-instantiated.

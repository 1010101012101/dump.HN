For free.<p>In the &quot;olden days&quot; we used to pay profs, in some cases cash collection, in exchange for hundreds of pages of photocopied text.<p>Now you can distribute a video, with someone else paying bandwidth both up and down for the cost of putting a URL on the class website or in a class email, which is kind of impressive.<p>There is an amusing meta &quot;loop&quot; that I was watching the FPGA video lecture series at home last week and during a video distributed so motivated students can self-teach, the prof was very unhappily complaining about students being too lazy to look up a simple .pdf datasheet for a temperature sensor so he was providing the information now as part of his notes or something along those lines.<p>So it would be possible that the same students too lazy to google for a simple device datasheet would never be motivated enough to watch a video lecture.<p>There are other alternatives.  Profs used to be graded on how well they used high tech multimedia, I could see a prof editing a MOOC-type or EDx-type video down to fill 80% of their class time and then spending most of the class time showing a video and then 15% or so answering questions or expanding upon topics or whatever.<p>I think the parasitic book industry would be very unhappy were they replaced by free web videos, so we can pretty much expect a very expensive video service to appear.

People do use them for self-study (even the 1964 Feynman lectures, which were only audio-recorded, are popular for that purpose), but typically for personal enrichment type purposes: study outside one&#x27;s own specialty, weekend study post-college, etc. (I personally don&#x27;t use them at all, because I use an even older technology for self-study: the textbook.)<p>If MOOCs succeed to a larger extent than video-lectures did, I think it will have to be by providing something other than just recorded lectures, which has been tried many times already.",1379864229

So in a typical rails stack that would be apt installs the system-wide stack (apache, ruby, passenger, rubygems) and then capistrano is used to deploy my webapps with their gems from my dev machine to their app-specific directory in the production server.<p>This way I can have my sysadmin hat on while setting up the server and depend on debian/ubuntu to handle security upgrades and generally create a consistent system. Then I can put my devops hat on and use capistrano and bundler to manage the security/dependencies of my own code.<p>But I see where this breaks down. If the base stack is moving at a much faster pace than the distributions (e.g., right now the version of passenger in Ubuntu LTS is incredibly old) it&#x27;s attractive to just ignore the system packages and install everything from original sources (e.g., install ruby from source with rbenv). But doing that is just throwing away the integration work the distribution has done. I&#x27;d much rather include some extra repositories to get updated versions that integrate through apt for the few things that I care to upgrade faster than Ubuntu LTS allows me. Right now that&#x27;s puppet, passenger and a few more.",1379864182

Sorry if I gave it away for anyone, as if this couldn&#x27;t have been guessed.<p>One thing not discussed, or I somehow missed it, is the topic of using resources from &quot;online classes&quot; to help traditional classes as a multimedia resource.  As an example, there&#x27;s a good Youtube video series of a Cornell prof&#x27;s Verilog FPGA course.  If you&#x27;re a bit confused about, say, writing a cellular automata in Verlog or at least the general concepts of doing something like that on a FPGA, well, spin up lecture 3 or 4 or so in the series.<p>In the long run, a state U could probably just show this prof&#x27;s videos as the lecture, and hire a TA or two to answer questions for the people who won&#x27;t pay attention to the video.  Those pro videos are actually edited to exclude mistakes, editorial comments, and small talk, which is in some ways unfortunate.<p>There are a couple classes worth of Gilbert Strang mathematics lectures.  I don&#x27;t really see any point in an amateur trying to lecture on uni level math if you can just watch Strang&#x27;s videos.<p>If you want to spend money, &quot;The Teaching Company&quot; has innumerable excellent production quality video lecture series on vaguely academic topics.  My public library has them for loan for free.<p>Another excellent example, the &quot;History of Iran&quot; podcast audio lecture series.  Audio recordings of Prof Richard Bulliet teaching a class at Columbia around 2008ish.  If you have 100+ hours to burn an amateur&#x27;s &quot;History of Rome&quot; podcast is pretty good too.  There&#x27;s more out there than just &quot;tech&quot;.<p>I suspect the primary long term effect is the end of the professorial lecture.  You&#x27;ll simply watch videos and at most talk to a TA.  I attended a thousand person Calc lecture a long time ago, never saw the prof closer than 100 feet or talked to him personally.  My discussion section TA was alright.

I know this is a dickish thing to say, but let&#x27;s look at it honestly. First, the top universities admit people who least need to attend them. Most admissions officers will admit that they want the kids who don&#x27;t <i>need</i> to go to a prestigious college to be successful. Now, that&#x27;s exactly what they should do-- getting the best students means they get the best teachers and researchers-- but it limits their value-add. They&#x27;d add more value (even if it&#x27;d be the wrong thing to do) by admitting students who actually need them, not the ones who don&#x27;t.<p>In general, social transformations (education processes, jobs, mentorship programs) converge on a state where those who can get the resources are those who need them the least. That&#x27;s not &quot;wrong&quot;; it&#x27;s just the equilibrium. People want to help those who don&#x27;t need the help. It&#x27;s human nature.<p>Now, one can argue that their value-add is inherent in what they do with those talented people once they are in, but if you compare the cost of a four-year degree and what is learned to what would be learned with that money, autonomy, and time, I don&#x27;t think the yield is better. Give a smart person 4 years of extremely high autonomy, and that person will learn a lot and grow. The high cost (in particular, opportunity cost) of university or college education cancels out what is gained (to society, and the person) by attending.<p>What&#x27;s exciting about MOOCs is that, by removing the scarcity and gatekeepers and rising market tuitions that lead to a zero-value-add equilibrium, we finally <i>are</i> getting to a point where all of this stuff might genuinely add value to the world.

6426837,comment,6425613,6425942,2,0,waps,,,"I wonder if someone would ever write a similar story about 100 years back. It would be much more relaxed, but in the same vein, and there&#x27;d be constant complaints about basic creature comforts. Heat, food and water. 99% of the time there is nothing to do, no way for anyone, never mind a young girl, to improve her circumstances. (The following is about life before the industrial revolution, or at least in the early parts of it)<p>Working to improve your own life was a pipe dream for most young people back then. Of course you were only young until you were 8 or 12 at the most. No school. Why ? And after that work on the field, or if you were lucky in the factory. Work was hard and dangerous, on the field as well as the factory, and if you were severely hurt, you&#x27;d essentially be left to die.<p>And it wouldn&#x27;t be a system of government working against you. It wouldn&#x27;t (for the most part) be people. It&#x27;d just be cold, hard reality. You could work, or not work, but if you didn&#x27;t you&#x27;d starve to death in a few months. If you had a good community around you, you&#x27;d still starve, just not to death.<p>And the only ways out, without money, were few and far between. Becoming a monk. Becoming a soldier. And even those were absurdly hard to get. Monk was by far the best. Still hard labour, but you&#x27;d be protected from most of the environment. A chance to become a priest, maybe even a learned priest or a scientist. The only real way to a position of some limited power open to the lower class. Actual books, and plenty of people around you who not only could read, but cared about reading and usually cared about teaching others to read as well. As a soldier your main job was to make sure rich-born kids could rape young girls on the countryside, protecting them from the obvious consequences. To keep starved people away from food.",1379862698

750745,comment,743053,743053,0,0,zbyszek,,,"I worked with a CM (at EPCC in Edinburgh, Scotland) in the mid-nineties for a little bit.  I think we used CM Fortran -- basically Fortran 77 with extra knobs on for parallelism.  I remember it as being a pleasant experience.  The programming paradigm effectively hid details of the data decomposition and communications and allowed you to write parallel code in a fairly straightforward fashion.  It was also the first supercomputer I go on to, so that was pretty exciting.\nAt the time, the CM was already being eclipsed by the Cray T3D and YMP.\nSome more ideosyncratic parallel machines I used a bit later were the APE 100 (from Alenia Spazio/Quadrics) and Fermilab's ACPMAPS, which was reminded me of the CM for programming, although I don't know if they were at all similar architecturally.",1249822739

But you may want to worry a bit about the electrolytic capacitors, they tend to dry out over time.<p>If you did the same with a 15 year old 486 and read a bunch of 3.5"" floppies (or worse, zip disks) I would be much more impressed :)<p>Eletronics back then were built to last, and the size of an individual bit on a medium from those days was large enough to withstand decay by auto-demagnetization better than anything new.

Some are using hip, trendy new things like Django or Rails. Many are still using ancient, forgotten things like COBOL and IBM mainframes (some friends of mine deal with those types of folks on a daily basis). And there are a lot of places that aren't single-language shops, but have an amalgamation of code accreted over the years.<p>Which all adds up to the fact that you really can't make useful statements about ""the mainstream""; all such statements tend, ultimately, to reflect hype machines rather than reality.",1249822190

There are serious asymmetries of information that handicap all of us, even the smartest. To take your example, I'd say that ingredients are listed on food so that consumers have the same information as the producers. People with allergies are just a particular subset of consumers who benefit from the level information playing field.<p>Another example: the SEC is set up to help keep information equally spread within financial markets, and in fact its (perhaps inevitable) failure to keep up with new information asymmetries involving complex mortgage derivatives and credit default swaps contributed significantly to the recent economic collapse.<p>But we can disagree in each particular case about whether the government should be responsible for improving information flow, or whether consumers should carry the burden themselves. I am definitely in favor of as little regulation as possible to get the job done. I'm just saying that some information asymmetries are literally huge and there's not much consumers can be expected to do without government's help.",1249821426

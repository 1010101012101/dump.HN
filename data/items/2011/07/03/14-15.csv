2723779,comment,2723609,2723609,12,0,jdvolz,,,"As someone who is living in Las Vegas NV (no state income tax) I am struggling with where I should move.  I just checked and the CA state income tax is 10% for my earning bracket.  That's a 10% premium (>$10k per year) when compared to Texas, Nevada and Washington.  It's also 1% greater than Oregon.  It's 5% greater than CO or NM.  Add to that the high cost of living in the valley (particularly housing) and it's difficult to justify moving to California vs. getting a remote job working for a company in California at the same salary.<p>I see the economic value of working the valley and that the salaries are higher, but they would have to be 30% higher than what I'm earning in Nevada just to offset the increase in costs.  Imagine if I actually wanted a raise.<p>If you tell me that not only is the CA legislature requiring these funds from me, but also requiring corporations with operations in the state to collect sales tax (putting them at a competitive disadvantage to companies that don't have operations there) I'm going to start to wonder about what other anti-business measures might get passed.  Anti-business measures are going to cause businesses to move if they can.  Less businesses means less chance for jobs which is obviously a negative for someone looking to move to economic opportunity.",1309705009

2723777,comment,2721621,2722390,1,0,Daniel14,,,"""They're too entrenched with no viable competitor, and who's going to try to 'take on' google? Where would you start?""<p>I disagree. All their products have serious competitors people can switch to anytime: Search - Bing; Mail - Yahoo; Docs - Office; Blogger - Wordpress; Android - WP7; Chrome - FF; the list goes on and on. Google is facing heavy competition on all fronts, and only time will tell if they can step up to their game. (See <a href=""http://techcrunch.com/2011/07/03/google-six-front-war/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://techcrunch.com/2011/07/03/google-six-front-war/</a> for further information). But I like Google's attitude of creating lots and lots of new products, without being concerned about who they compete with, as they really seem to shake up the industry for the better wherever they enter.<p>Lastly, your last paragraph about ""How would we know if they did something we disagreed with?"" sounds pretty paranoid to me. If Google screws up we're going to find out very quickly). Google doesn't control the internet. Blogs, Twitter, Facebook, traditional news etc. will make sure we'll find out about it, even if Google starts censoring their search results (which, admirably, they've completely refused to do in the past).",1309704951

2723764,comment,2723001,2723338,8,0,Scaevolus,,,"Nanopond's instruction set is based on Brainfuck, and it's ""evolvable"" because it's very easy for self-replicating programs to be generated at random. Quines are a sizable percentage of the total program space.<p>The nanopond world is a 640x480 grid (edges wrap) where each cell has an energy, a genome, an ID, and a parent ID (a dead cell has an ID of zero). Each tick, a random cell's genome is executed. At various intervals, a random cell is selected and given a random genome and some energy.<p>The first four bits of a cell's genome is called the logo, and is skipped over during execution.<p>The virtual machine has an instruction pointer, a 4-bit register, an output buffer, a pointer, and a facing direction, which selects which adjacent cell it interacts with.<p>These are the 16 instructions, with associated pseudocode:<p><pre><code>    0 ZERO: register = pointer = facing = 0\n    > FWD: pointer++\n    < BACK: pointer--\n    + INC: register++\n    - DEC: register--\n    g READG: register = genome[pointer]\n    G WRITEG: genome[pointer] = register\n    b READB: register = buffer[pointer]\n    B WRITEB: buffer[pointer] = register\n    [ LOOP: if register is nonzero jump forward to matching REP\n    ] REP: if register is zero jump back to matching\n    t TURN: facing = register & 3\n    x XCHG: register = genome[instruction_pointer++]\n    k KILL: kill adjacent cell (set ID to 0)\n    s SHARE: equalize energy with adjacent cell\n    . STOP: end execution\n</code></pre>\nEvery instruction executed costs 1 energy. When a cell has zero energy, it is dead, though a SHARE command can revive it.<p>At the end of execution, the output buffer is written into the adjacent (facing) cell. This SHARE and KILL require permissions, which are basically whether the cell is dead or a random chance depending on how close the current register is close enough to logo. A failed SHARE or KILL costs extra energy.<p>Here's the most common genome in my simulation after 3 billion iterations:<p>#gtsg-[G>gB]kx0. (where # is the logo and can be any value)<p>Decomposed:\n#gtsg-[G : turn in the direction given by the logo, share energy with the adjacent cell, decrement, and write that as the logo for the output genome. This has the effect of rotating the cell's direction by 90 degrees every execution.<p>[G>gB] : copy the genome into the output buffer. G[>gB] would be more efficient, but that's evolution is blind!<p>kx0. : Try to kill the cell the output is going into, to increase chances of successful replication. I'm unsure if x0 (loads a zero into the register) improves fitness.<p>After running for a bit, the core replication loop tends to be very stable-- much like how parts of ribosomes have been unchanged for 2 billion years. There are many ways to achieve low-level replication, but it's almost impossible to transition between them by gradual changes.",1309704456

Suppose (for the sake of the argument) that someone invented a copier tomorrow that could copy any physical object. That would be a tremendous win for humanity.

However, I was hoping someone could explain to this poor soul how a scenario like the following is ruled out by this language:<p>I'm the dropbox CEO. I provide a free service for most of my users. As time goes on, I'm having trouble making ends meet.  I find that unless I get more cash in the next 7 days, I will be unable to pay my hosting bill and my service will be shuttered. Thus, obtaining more cash is <i>necessary for the Service</i>.<p>Now along comes a firm, we'll just call them SLP. SLP is willing to give me a bridge loan on very good terms immediately. The only catch is that they require me to sublicense worldwide royalty-free rights to use, copy and publicly display all works stored in the dropbox service. Their purposes for wanting the data is unclear, however it is quite clear that I won't have oversight on the use of the data. I can imagine, however, that they might be interested in using it for data mining, advertising or industrial espionage. We don't speak of any details, though. If I revoke the license, the bridge loan plus penalties immediately comes due.<p>I can find no other source of funding at this time - I've played all my other cards. I, as the CEO, believe taking this loan at these terms is absolutely necessary if I am going to continue providing the service. So, I sign, sublicense, and don't actually inform even many people in my company let alone the user base. SLP quietly gets read only access to all the data. To whatever extent SLP uses this data, they believe their use of it is <i>necessary for the Service</i> in that they don't believe the bridge loan will ever be repaid and they believe it is necessary to extract value from the data to recoup any losses they expect on the loan.<p>Now, mind you, I don't actually believe that dropbox has any sort of intent of doing something like this, or that they'd be likely to do so even if their back was against the wall. I also agree it's a pretty far fetched scenario.<p>I'm simply wondering how a license like this (and the multitide of others like it, I'm not intending to single dropbox out at all) prevents this behavior.

Islam's goal isn't to kill people, in fact the basic tenants of the religion are to live a life of peace & spirituality and live in harmony with one's neighbours. Of course this doesn't apply if your neighbours are attacking you, but you should note that what you see is the actions of a few form a religious base of well over 1 billion people.<p>You also have to understand that the terrorism that you see didn't just arise from a vacuum, people don't just decide to kill other people for no reason, a major part of it has to do with revenge and retribution for past acts committed against them. Not that I am condoning their actions, I just think that you should understand there is more to the media portrayal that goes on, almost every action committed is put in the spotlight of religion even if many of the people involved (such as governments) are not religious, yet no one would think the same of the United States.<p>Note, I am not going to pursue this further since I don't feel the need to start a religious war in HN.

Whether a tax code is progressive usually refers to the shape of the income/taxes graph, rather than its absolute level.  If you just look at that then (including VAT and social security etc) US federal taxes are a bit more progressive than in Sweden, though I believe that if you add the (usually regressive) state taxes Sweden comes out ahead with respect to most US states.

Regions have their own set of costs, as we're finding out (mostly due to the annotation burden if you start doing complicated stuff), but I think we'll be in a nice sweet spot. Rust gives you three basic options:<p>(1) Regions, when you want safe, low-overhead allocation. The downside is a more complex type system. (Usually you don't see the complexity unless you're returning pointers that contain references to the stack, at which point you have to convince the typechecker that you aren't creating dangling pointers by doing so.)<p>(2) Safe, garbage collected heap allocation. This gives you maximum flexibility at the cost of runtime overhead.<p>(3) Unsafe pointers. This lets you manage your memory manually, like C++. Of course, this is unsafe.<p>Also, I suspect we're going to add fixed-length vectors; we've been discussing this quite a bit lately and I think there's general consensus that they should be present in the language in some form.",1332173605

For scientists or novice programmers wanting to do some numerically intensive work, Matlab has typically offered one of the quickest (in time-to-solution) prototyping platforms. One of the keys being that you can get started very quickly, with minimal setup (besides the expensive license and installation, something most academics need not worry about). As a former academic programmer and now a consultant that helps companies commercialize such prototypes, I understand your pain, but at the same time I completely understand why a physicist, imaging scientist, or finance major ends up using Matlab over something like C++ or Python. Same goes for LabView, and if you despise Matlab, I challenge you to give LabView a whirl. The gap between the Matlabs and Labviews of the world and the other programming languages is closing in terms of ease of use and setup time, but we&#x27;re not there yet and also momentum shifts on this type of thing take a loooong time. If you come into a lab and are working on a research project that was started in Matlab, odds are, in the interest of finishing your thesis on time, you&#x27;re unlikely to port it to another language, even if you have the skill to do so.",1449161453

And also, paper records don&#x27;t come up in a Google search (which is the extent of &quot;research&quot; for many people today).<p>Why didn&#x27;t the school back then have a policy of throwing away cards after x number of years? Probably for the same reason why anything was done before computers became so ubiquitous...we constantly underestimate how the power of computation and networking changes the accessibility of information. Back when I graduated from college (and by this time, Google was a major player), no one really complained about printing people&#x27;s names (i.e. mostly students) in the police blotter. Now, I believe it is a rarity for a school newspaper that publishes online to also publish full names of the suspects, even though no federal/state laws have been passed that would require such discretion. The reason why this practice is now rare is pretty common-sensical to us today, but not so much when Google was still relatively new.",1449161432

The word &quot;mellitus&quot; is latin with roots in the word for honey and means sweet or sweetened with honey.  So really both diseases are named for the fact that the produce the symptom of large amounts of sweet urine.  Biologically this is because uncontrolled type I and type I sufferers have extraordinarily high blood sugars.  Some of this excess glucose is excreted in the urine and osmotically pulls fluid along with it increasing the total urine volume.<p>It&#x27;s worth noting that diabetes (the symptom) can have multiple other causes.

LLC and corporations are both organizational structures; either an LLC or a corporation can be a regular, tax-exposed operation, or a tax-exempt non-profit under the tax code (including a tax-exempt charity under 501(c)(3)). The fact that the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative is an LLC <i>does not</i> distinguish it from a non-profit; the fact (if it is a fact, and I can&#x27;t really see drawing a strong conclusion on that on the basis of an article that starts out from a premise that confuses organization structure with tax-exempt non-profit status -- but the other discussion in the article from other sources seems consistent with it being an LLC that is <i>not</i> intended as a tax-exempt non-profit) that it doesn&#x27;t comply with any of the categories for tax exemption and hasn&#x27;t applied for recognition as a tax-exempt non-profit would.<p>Really, a non-tax-exempt entity (whether LLC, corporation, or any other organizational structure) makes sense to coordinate philanthropic activities if you want to have flexibility that a 501(c)(3) wouldn&#x27;t have and, since the funds are all coming from you, you don&#x27;t need the incentive to donors that the tax-deductibility of donations to a 501(c)(3) would provide. If its a disregarded entity for tax purposes (which it can be with a sole owner or, IIRC, co-owners who are a married couple who file jointly), then anything the LLC donates to a 501(c)(3) has the same effect on the taxpayers liability as if the taxpayer had donated directly to the 501(c)(3). The same person could even establish one or more 501(c)(3) entities -- again, of any organizational structure, including LLCs -- through which to which the non-exempt LLC would donate funds for purposes that are within the scope of what is permitted for a 501(c)(3).",1449161214

The Model 3 isn&#x27;t even released, probably won&#x27;t be widely available for another couple years, will likely cost around $50K comparably equipped, and even then Tesla likely couldn&#x27;t make enough to make a dent in the overall market.<p>The Leaf is a great car (IMO), but even in a major metro (DFW) spot-charging is really impractical. There are NO DC quick-chargers in North or North East Dallas last I looked, and you at minimum have to have a subscription just to have the option to pay to use them. There&#x27;s a reasonable number of Blink Network chargers around, but no one who&#x27;s actually used those would suggest they&#x27;re a viable way to maintain a charge without major compromises. Using a Leaf to commute to the suburbs is an experience fraught with stress as well.<p>Maybe in a couple years the Leaf will have kicked the range-anxiety issue to the curb. And the Chevy Beat looks very promising. 2 cars in the range of the average new car purchase price does not make for domination though.<p>My prediction is that it&#x27;s realistically going to be <i>at least</i> 3 car generations before that has a chance of happening, and most manufacturers haven&#x27;t even released a full EV yet. That&#x27;s a good 15 to 20 years as a best case scenario. That doesn&#x27;t address the Truck and family SUV market either. These things are made for hauling. They&#x27;re going to suck down a lot more power. &quot;Work Trucks&quot; aren&#x27;t going to convert for much longer Though I think there&#x27;s a good chance many will go hybrid in ~10 years.

A lot more so than people even realize. Instant torque and acceleration response makes them really fun to drive.

Most containers are built on top of full OS images, with a full OS image&#x27;s worth of vulnerabilities (some inert because services aren&#x27;t running, but setuid&#x27;s still respected--and I wonder how many setuid&#x27;d tools are actively tested in a containerized environment!), and it&#x27;s rare in my experience that those base containers actually get updated after the end user selects one and a version to go along with it.

Of course we are all transhumanists together here, reading this post while hoping and planning for a future in which fundamental limits of the human condition will be overcome through technological progress. Istvan has been publishing and speaking relentlessly on the topic of transhumanism for years now, and of late has settled upon the forthcoming presidential race as one of the few opportunities for an activist to make use of the US political system to promote a cause. In Europe starting single issue parties is a viable approach, but not in the US. So Istvan is touring, attracting attention, and giving interviews.<p>Here is something to consider: in the matter of changing the world, is it better to fund research into the technological progress you desire or is it better to fund publicity efforts for that same technological progress? I suspect that both are needed, striking some sort of balance between (a) science that is within striking distance but effectively invisible to the world and large funding sources, which has been the state for SENS rejuvenation research for quite some time, and (b) advocacy that is so far ahead of technological plausibility that the snake-oil salesmen sneak in and corrupt an entire generation with their nonsense, which is the story of the last quarter of the last century with respect to progress towards the treatment of aging. An argument for the &quot;fund research&quot; side is that meaningful progress in science tends to generate its own news. An argument for the &quot;more publicity efforts&quot; side is that there are plenty of historical examples of important scientific progress languishing at the verge of completion for a lifetime or longer. Personally, I&#x27;m in favor of funding the research at this time, and one of my main reasons for that is that early stage research has become very cheap over the course of the modern biotechnology revolution, while publicity remains stubbornly expensive.

An example would be<p><pre><code>         Please close the back door so that the bugs don&#x27;t come in.\n</code></pre>\n> This would be a logic error if the front door is also open: even though the command makes sense and you can close the back door, this doesn&#x27;t actually accomplish the goal of keeping the bugs out since they&#x27;ll still come in the front door.<p>---------------<p>As someone who also struggles to teach beginners how to program...I&#x27;ve learned that teaching the concept of &quot;error&quot; is extremely difficult. Non-programmers have a much fuzzier concept of what a programming &quot;error&quot; is, and this is a major obstacle.<p>Right now I&#x27;m teaching SQL, which is relatively straightforward as languages go. When a student tells me they ran into an error (and more often than not, doesn&#x27;t think to include the error message), it can mean any of these things:<p>1. There&#x27;s a syntax error.<p>2. The GUI crashed, or was otherwise acting up.<p>3. No results were returned.<p>4. Nonsensical results were returned (such as when doing an inner join without supplying a constraint).<p>#3 and #4 are incredibly annoying to deal with...because they <i>aren&#x27;t</i> errors, at least on behalf of the interpreter.  If your WHERE condition is `NAME = &#x27;Dan&#x27; AND NAME = &#x27;Daniel&#x27;&quot; -- and you get exactly 0 results -- that is what is <i>supposed</i> to happen. Some might even argue that it&#x27;s not really a logical error; it&#x27;s just a tautology. The problem is with the user&#x27;s <i>expectation</i> -- they <i>think</i> they&#x27;ve written something more profound than a tautology, and there&#x27;s nothing the SQL interpreter can really do to tell them otherwise (short of installing a Clippy-like plugin that pops up and asks, &quot;Did you really mean to ask that?&quot;...which, as we all know, has its own tradeoffs...)<p>But this isn&#x27;t even the most frustrating part -- what&#x27;s frustrating is when beginners don&#x27;t even know what to expect...so for problems of type #4...when they&#x27;ve done a WHERE conditional like this: `WHERE Name != &#x27;Dan&#x27; OR Name != &#x27;Daniel&#x27;`...and get <i>all</i> of the results...they think their program &quot;worked&quot;...especially if they hadn&#x27;t noticed that the number of returned results is, coincidentally, the exact number of results in the entire unfiltered table.<p>So to go back to the OP&#x27;s explanation of an error above...it&#x27;s just <i>wrong</i>...because it&#x27;s not a logical error. And it&#x27;s not even a real-life &quot;common sense&quot; error -- closing the back door (in a normal scenario) <i>does</i> prevent bugs coming in...at least _from the back door_. The only way you could interpret this as an &quot;error&quot; is to have the expectation that a single sentence/command/statement should be the one-all solution to the problem...and that is an assumption that is profoundly <i>limited</i> in how it implies that there is only one solution, or that solutions don&#x27;t have tradeoffs (both in real life and in the computational setting)<p>After all, if the student amends the statement to add &quot;AND the front door&quot;...it&#x27;s still an error because what about the side doors or windows? And even then, another student could reasonably argue that the &quot;correct&quot; answer is to &quot;take off and nuke the entire site from orbit. It’s the only way to be sure.&quot;<p>So, yeah, explaining computational concepts to people who are used to the fuzzy and beautiful way that humans communicate and miscommunicate is really, really difficult...and I believe that explaining the concept of errors is probably at the top of the difficulty pyramid.",1449159767

That will encourage even more workers to immigrate to developed countries.<p>>Long before a small fraction of these &quot;millions&quot; get around to leaving and moving to the west, the market would have stabilized a bit.<p>You have no evidence for this. It&#x27;s just wishful thinking.<p>>Eventually we will see &quot;millions&quot; of western developers taking a small paycut to move to Romania or Maruitius or wherever for lifestyle reasons.<p>How long is eventually? There&#x27;s no way to know, it could be decades before labor markets stabilize.<p>>I hope someone will come here to replace my job for much cheaper, I am sick of it.<p>That makes no sense.

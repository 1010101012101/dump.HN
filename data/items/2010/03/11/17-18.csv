The usual examples are Verizon-AT&T, Apple-MS, etc. Here the underdog or newcomer has nothing to lose so they will mention the market leader's brand.<p>So, here MS is not afraid, rather it doesn't make sense for them to mention Linux or rather any *nix by name.

That is what I suspect you are quoting.  However that claim doesn't have good support.  But figures that I have seen peg the rate of people who are primarily homosexual much lower than that.  See <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homosexuality#Demographics"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homosexuality#Demographics</a> for some random figures.  From that list the number I would quote for the USA is 4%.<p>However if you look at it differently, much more than 10% of the population cares.  According to polls almost half the electorate thinks that gays should be allowed to marry.  And a lot of non-homosexuals agree that the issue is important.  So supporters of gay marriage aren't limited to gays.<p>My personal feeling is that consenting adults should be allowed to enter into any consensual arrangement that they wish.  Therefore I am fully in support of allowing both gay marriage and polygamy, even though I have no desire to engage in either lifestyle.  I should be clear on this.  My position on polygamy doesn't come from my position gay marriage.  They both come from more fundamental beliefs.  But I suspect that as more people become familiar with the idea of polygamy as they have with the idea of gay marriage, that there will be a growing acceptance of it.  And as an example of this I'd offer the changing opinions in Canada.  First gay marriage became accepted, and now polygamy is becoming accepted.<p>So while logically polygamy doesn't flow from gay marriage, I think that the opponents of gay marriage are correct that acceptance of gay marriage is a step towards the likely future acceptance of polygamy.",1268327874

What you just said is nonsense and Linus, if you can get his attention, will be happy to set you straight.<p>In case you can't get his attention, the real story is that Linus understood that letting Tridge create a clone of BK was just asking for trouble.  Imagine if there was a commercial clone of git, done by people without access to the git source code.  And it was used to read and write git repos.  Now imagine that the commercial guys didn't really understand git and they made a mistake and that mistake corrupted part of the repo.  And imagine that that corruption got picked up and propogated by the real git.<p>Kind of a mess, right?  Especially when you consider that git is a distributed system.  Actually happened to the Linux kernel when it was in BK because someone went and editted the metadata directly to ""fix"" a problem.  How do you fix a problem that is in thousands of repos?  We fixed it by putting knowledge of the Linux kernel and that problem into BK and doing a new release.<p>Linus was smart enough to realize that that sort of problem was extremely likely if people started using a Tridge created BK clone.  And he realized that there was zero chance that when problems occurred that people would blame them on Tridge, BK would catch all the flack.  So he got off BK because he was actually grateful for the help we provided and wasn't interested in causing us harm.<p>This was after him spending months arguing with Tridge that Tridge was doing the wrong thing.<p>But don't take my word for it, go ask him.",1268326821

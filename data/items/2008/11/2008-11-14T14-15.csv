I have been to many tradeshows, and have seen a lot of hot-to-semi-hot girls walking around clad in various T-shirts.<p>If your target market is mid-20's guys, I think this angle could have some merit.  If your target market is the ""average"" consumer or corporation, I'm not sure how much marketshare you are really going to get from a pair of tits or an ass logo.<p>I think the real angle for these girls is to do a ""Social Media Starter Kit"".  This T-Shirt girl would be better off not just ""mentioning"" the product and flickr and twitter, but setting up accounts for these companies and ""seeding"" the social media sites, then handing the keys over with a bit of training to the organizations.  Basically teach the companies that want to leverage social media but don't know where to start how to jump in.<p>That would likely be a week-long effort, and she could probably charge $3000/wk, based on what I've seen from the  current crop of wanna-be SEO hacks.",1226674681

Programming languages all require a big time investment in learning them - so those that exist tend to stay around. People only change languages when there are very clear benefits. Clojure seems to have pulled up to the same level as other much older and better known programming languages - there are no benefits (at the moment) to it that would make the mass of programmers switch to it.<p>Ruby is a good language, but it only became popular when it offered a clear benefit.<p>For a language to enter the mainstream and stay in the mainstream, it has to do a lot more than just not be bad. It has to be better than others in some way.<p>(By the way, being a functional language does not make it better, it makes it worse, since most programmers have trouble grasping functional concepts)<p>At the moment, clojure may not have any negatives, but it does not have any strong positives, so I don't see why it would catch on.",1226673908

I'm just pointing out that a ""living wage"" in beverly hills can't be more than a ""living wage"" in Compton + cost of commuting.<p>Incidentally, the market adjusts wages in exactly that way: the 50'th st Qdoba in Manhattan pays a couple bucks more/hour than the Hoboken Qdoba.

364309,comment,364219,364286,0,0,Maktab,,,"Regardless of the merits (or lack thereof) of the parent's argument, your comparison is facile. So-called 'separate but equal' legislation never provided for anything close to legal equality. Civil unions, on the other hand, could provide the same legal rights as marriage.<p>But that's besides the point. The real story here is that Prop. 8 passed mostly due to the high turnout of African-American voters as a result of Obama's candidacy. As a block, American-Americans tend to vote against gay rights and gay marriage issues, and so the high turnout was what swung the ballot in favour of Prop. 8.<p>The lesson here should be that the gay community of the US has not done enough to reach out to the African-American community in order to gain greater acceptance and understanding. Despite all the advocacy against white religious conservatives and high-profile court campaigns, there has been precious little effort in convincing voters why they have nothing to fear and why gays should have the right to marry because that would be fair and just.<p>Until that happens, gay Americans are going to have to be content with winning brief victories through the courts while fearing each and every time the general public is given the chance to have their own say on the issue.",1226673461

Hide (CMD-H) is what you should be using when you want to minimize.  Hide others (CMD-ALT-H) is also very useful.<p>The only time minimize is useful is if you are using a particular application with multiple windows open and you aren't going to be working in one of those windows but don't want to close it because you might come back to it later.  In addition to getting it off your screen, this is also helpful so that when you are hitting CTRL-` to switch between the app's windows the window you aren't working in doesn't come up.

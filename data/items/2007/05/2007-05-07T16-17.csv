That's less than 2 lines/minute - if I'm coding as fast as I type I can usually do 7-8 lines/minute, so it's ample padding for debugging, optimization, design work, etc.<p>The conditions for burst productivity (""flow"", in the psychological literature) are:<p>1. Well-defined, achievable goals<p>2. Automatic knowledge of your toolset - you don't have to look things up about your platform.<p>3. Fresh & well-rested<p>4. No interruptions<p>His article explicitly addresses 1, 2, & 4, and I suspect he arranged his time so 3 was satisfied too.  He knew what he wanted from his site, and ruthlessly trimmed it so he only needed to implement features directly relating to the core goal.  It was his 5th Cake PHP app, so he knew his toolset in and out.  The 66.5 hours were not all spent in a row, and he had no interruptions or overhead while working on it.<p>These conditions also held in my Scrutiny example (done over Thanksgiving break my senior year of college, with some cleanup over winter break) and Bootstrapacitor (done over 2 weeks + 1 week of cleanup, finished about a week ago).  They did not hold for FictionAlley (my first PHP webapp) or my startup (my first Python webapp, and we also don't really fully understand the problem yet), and those two projects take significantly longer.",1178556554

20216,comment,20215,20215,0,0,schmoe,,,"With the nearly endless supply of interesting links from del.icio.us, digg, reddit, news.yc, etc, do you use one of the popular link aggregators to stay on top of what's hot?  So far I've come across three that look interesting: popurls <a href=""http://popurls.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://popurls.com/</a> theweblist <a href=""http://theweblist.net/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://theweblist.net/</a> and trendalicious <a href=""http://glozer.net/trendy/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://glozer.net/trendy/</a>  I really like the mix of textual and visual links on popurls, but my favorite is trendalicious because it combines links from del.icio.us, digg, and reddit into one ""top 100"" list. Just wish it included news.yc too!",1178556109

My wife and I agreed not to list her as a founder on my YC app even though her contribution has been significant.  If I walked away from ourdoings.com, she probably wouldn't find another coder to make it happen.  If she stopped contributing I would still make it happen.",1178556047

Microsoft's solution seems to be to have two products and pretend they are just one.",1178555490

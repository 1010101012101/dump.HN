8920821,comment,8918776,8920533,0,0,vinceguidry,,,"> someone making the 920375235236th standard CRUD oriented java enterprise site<p>People always think this when they think CRUD. The reality is, even CRUD can get quite complex. Even just laying out an HTML page <i>properly</i> takes a lot of knowledge. Understanding the &#x27;zen&#x27; of CSS. The zen of HTML5. The zen of jQuery. What looks simple on the surface can get very complicated quickly. If you don&#x27;t respect that complexity, then you&#x27;ll find it tedious, and won&#x27;t apply your problem-solving mind to it, won&#x27;t abstract that difficulty away, and will find it unbelievably painful to maintain and add features to later on down the line.<p>I&#x27;m making what looks on the surface to be standard CRUD. A product info management app. Well, the product data itself are key-value pairs and the design calls for you to be able to edit which keys you&#x27;re able to put in. So there&#x27;s no set database schema, and I don&#x27;t want to do anything like making a two-column table of values that has a zillion rows, so I&#x27;m using Postgres Hstore. Now I have to maintain an abstraction layer over that which has gone through a few iterations and might have to withstand a few more.<p>It makes creating views difficult because you don&#x27;t know just how big everything&#x27;s going to be. So I might spend a whole day laying out the list page, diving into the minutiae of CSS rules, thinking carefully about all the different types of data it&#x27;s supposed to display and deciding where to put certain types of logic so that I can reuse it later if needed.<p>The thing about CRUD is that to really do it right, you have to also think carefully about the data domain. If you&#x27;re not building flexibly, which takes up-front time, then when you have to move stuff it&#x27;s going to feel really painful. I realized that I don&#x27;t want the ability to add new SKUs to be accessible to normal users, so I moved it into the admin section.<p>It took five minutes and was as straightforward as it sounds. But if you&#x27;re not all that great at web dev and/or don&#x27;t respect the power tools at your disposal, such a move could take all day and introduce subtle bugs in your UX that you won&#x27;t catch until next week when you&#x27;re working on something else.<p>If you really are trying to re-solve a solved problem, like blogging, then don&#x27;t do any programming at all, just fire up Wordpress. Absolutely solving solved problems again is going to be tedious. But if you&#x27;re building a CRUD app, and you can&#x27;t find something interesting about it, then you&#x27;re not really applying your full mind to it. There&#x27;s a reason you&#x27;re being asked to build it, because the functionality they need isn&#x27;t being offered elsewhere.<p>I built a vehicle reservation system that was &quot;standard CRUD&quot; but they wanted this dashboard style view that took up half the dev time that I thought was really interesting and turned out great. The rest of the CRUD came out easy, we have lots of tools at our disposal for generating that sort of thing.",1421801849

I think the general consensus of literature on adolescent bullying in US and US-like countries, including some not, like Japan and China, is that bullies are among the most popular people in the school context.<p>There are also studies showing that bullies experience protective effects against some psychological issues, such as social anxiety and loneliness.<p>Also, both bystanders rate bullies as the most popular people, and they also list them as the most <i>desirable</i> people (victims do too, which is very unintuitive).<p>Also very interesting: bullying behaves like a social position, with people moving in and out as bully one year, but not the next, whereas victimhood is more stable, like an identity, and may persist from school to school and to online social contexts.<p>Here&#x27;s what I&#x27;d like to know. Since I haven&#x27;t read a shred of literature on adult workplace bullying, I&#x27;m curious to see if <i>bystanders</i> still behave the same way.

We&#x27;re eager to front-run on experience and knowledge, but unwilling to sit around and let them cook.  And, frankly, this is somewhat justified, as devs aren&#x27;t famous for sticking around.<p>What we should be doing is satisficing rather than optimizing.<p>If you (and now I mean <i>you</i> you, not the indefinite) were going to work exclusively on the front-end, I <i>highly</i> doubt you&#x27;d know the answer to these.

We&#x27;re switching (back) to Backbone tomorrow.<p>Would any of this make you unsuitable for the position?  I don&#x27;t think so.<p>Back to the example, yes, if you&#x27;ve got a hairy distributed systems problem, and someone applies with 20 years of experience in distributed systems, yes, <i>you hire them</i>.  But if and when they call and say, &quot;Well, Google offered me more millions than you offered me hundreds of thousands, so...&quot; and you&#x27;re left with candidates with 20 years of experience divided between COBOL, webmastering, AJAX, Rails work, and open-source contributions to Julia and <i>Battle for Wesnoth</i>...then yeah, sorry you didn&#x27;t get the unicorn, but <i>that second guy will be just fine</i>.  Get the distributed-systems guy in as a consultant for a week or two if you have to.  If he really is that good, you might not need to hire anyone at all!<p>This whole thing is a result of developers overvaluing intelligence and being scared of not being the expert on something, employers <i>buying it</i> that programmers are superpeople, and then acting like it&#x27;s a betrayal of trust when they don&#x27;t know every small detail of every technology they&#x27;ve ever used, and both parties&#x27; refusal to think about what they <i>need</i>, rather than what they <i>want</i>.  The tell-tale sign is that &quot;hiring is hard,&quot; but there are still technology companies around.

I optimized ADO recordsets, SQL Server tables and stored procedures, optimized Crystal Reports reports, and fixed broken Visual BASIC code so it wouldn&#x27;t crash the machine and it runs faster.

It &quot;didn&#x27;t work&quot; in an odd way, though: it raised a &quot;Communication Error&quot; that would never occur on other pages, just Hacker News.

Perhaps I have been in the industry for too long, but these days I much prefer being a specialist in a particular niche as opposed to be known as the guy in the office who gets emailed when the printer breaks, a server goes down, a Wordpress site needs to be built or someone has a question about why their email is broken.<p>I have been in that situation a few times in my career, when I worked at a digital agency especially. My job varied from Javascript, CSS and HTML, to developing HTML newsletters, building Wordpress websites, setting up servers/databases and tonnes of other things. At the time it was an invaluable learning experience, but also meant I worked long hours because my list of responsibilities was longer, friendships suffered because I worked a lot of weekends/late nights. As a result of that job, I didn&#x27;t feel like it made me an expert in one particular thing. I was good at many things, but not truly great at front or back-end development. I felt like I had to learn outside of work hours to get good enough to specialise in my chosen field (my day-to-day job was obviously also a factor).<p>If I went for a job advertised as one thing, but then discovered that they expect you to be good at a lot of other things it would make me think twice (at least now I do). When I first started out, I was willing to do anything because I was young, naive and excited I had a job doing what I wanted to do in life.<p>My initial thoughts would be, &quot;Please, not again.

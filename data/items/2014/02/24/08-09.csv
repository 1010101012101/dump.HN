7289763,comment,7289600,7289700,13,0,m0nastic,,,"<i>How will Microsoft not be able to develop Mobile Office for Android?</i><p>By most reporting[1], the office team has already had versions of office for iOS (and presumably Android) ready for quite some time. Their lack of release has been an internal political battle at Microsoft based on whether to postpone them until after the equivalent office apps are ready for RT. This is one of the biggest examples of decision making that people have been criticizing Microsoft for (handicapping their non-Windows business units to provide Windows a competitive advantage; which is a sensible strategy, but that seems ill-suited longterm, as those other business units like Office now eclipse Windows in revenue).<p>It&#x27;s entirely possible that part of Nokia releasing this phone is related to that recent shift in strategy.<p><i>How are Microsoft going to be able to maintain two mobile OSs?</i><p>Nokia already has experience in managing operating systems. I don&#x27;t know how much work &quot;porting&quot; over all the Nokia apps was to Android, but it seems like they&#x27;ve done it. They already went through the experience of porting many of them over from Symbian (and alas, Maemo didn&#x27;t really have much in the way of Nokia apps). I don&#x27;t think this is a serious issue for their engineering organization (even aside from Microsoft&#x27;s much larger engineering organization that presumably could be made available).<p><i>Are Nokia going to see this through? I think it is a smart play, if they go after it whole-heartedly like Amazon and provide a decent amount of differentiation. One could easily see Samsung going this route.</i><p>I think this is a logical play from a risk perspective. The low-end is currently where all their sales are (as the mid and high end have dried up faster than their increasing Windows Phone sales have grown); and even though the low-end isn&#x27;t the desirable part of the market (see every phone manufacturer other than Apple and Samsung as examples), the effort required isn&#x27;t much greater than they&#x27;re already doing for the Asha lines.<p>I think they&#x27;ll have a better chance at building an ecosystem that&#x27;s piggy-backed off of Android than in building their own. I still don&#x27;t know that this is a great long-term play, but it could be.<p>Samsung has been alleged to be heading in this direction for ages (first reported as the reasons for them releasing Bada, and later, Tizen). The new Gear 2 watch-thing runs Tizen instead of Android (which considering it&#x27;s not really a stand-alone device, is probably a good place to test the waters).<p>It seems like the issue with Samsung taking the plunge is how much they attribute their recent success to their own products, vs. the Google ecosystem. Once they cross that threshold, they&#x27;ll ship their own OS with TouchWiz on top of it. Maybe they&#x27;ll similarly have an environment that can run Android apps (it&#x27;s all Linux underneath).<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.zdnet.com/microsoft-office-on-ipad-its-alive-and-coming-sooner-than-most-think-7000026372/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.zdnet.com/microsoft-office-on-ipad-its-alive-and-...</a>",1393231987

Julia has a clear goal of taking on the scientific and statistics domains where R, Matlab and Sci/NumPy are currently dominant. It is an elegantly designed language that provides blazingly fast bindings to established Fortran and C numerical libraries.<p>Nimrod is statically typed and compiles to C, C++ or Objective C. It seems to be aiming to be &#x27;general purpose&#x27;, but there has been efforts to position it as a systems level language.

Or, shock, horror, maybe Microsoft are testing the waters - they already make a bunch from Linux patents, maybe they want to see how much they&#x27;ll make from App Store revenue if these gain a decent market share. When you think about it, Apple doesn&#x27;t charge for iOS so if Microsoft start doing decent hardware sales maybe Microsoft will start considering its mobile operating system division this way.

I&#x27;ve been taught about this is the soviet school, where they explained me the communism is right around the corner and it would look exactly like that. In the real world, meanwhile, everything consumed has to be produced, and if you want power, cars, manufacturing and farming, somebody has to manufacture and farm it. So for you to get it for free means somebody has to produce it and then either gift it to you or you will take it away by force. Last time I checked giving away cars wasn&#x27;t that popular (if I&#x27;m wrong please tell me where I can pick up my free Tesla) so I guess you&#x27;d have to take these cars by force.

In twenty or some odd years, we might have the capability for computers to understand &quot;if you mow my lawn I&#x27;ll pay you $20.&quot; But lets leave that aside for now. The question really is: are there problems for which this technology can work? What immediately comes to mind is automated billing. Bills can easily be automatically paid with something like bitcoin. Now, if we extend that to performance based billing, we have something similar to what the OP was talking about: the contract can verify the performance and conduct the payments accordingly. Other areas where this might apply: loans, paying your share of the rent, or auction sites. In short, it has potential. That is not to say that it will replace written contracts any time soon, but rather that I think that it has the potential to do so sometime in the future.",1393229464

I think the most common misconception about evolution is that it is not a system of &quot;best&quot; but rather &quot;just good enough&quot;.<p>For example, do you like your lungs? They work pretty well, right? But how long can you hold your breath under water? Obviously cetaceans have much better lungs that humans, but that&#x27;s because our lungs are <i>just good enough</i> for running around on a savannah. If we were forced to dive to incredible depths to search for our food, we&#x27;d need to evolve better lungs, as the cetaceans have done.<p>Before the dolphins get to smug, though, they don&#x27;t have the best lungs either. The title of best lungs goes to the birds. Whereas all other air breathing animals have bidirectional flow in their lungs, birds have evolved a system of continuous unidirectional flow. Turns out that bidirectional flow is <i>not</i> good enough at high altitudes with an extremely high metabolic rate.<p>As for what makes Biology and Medicine difficult, I think the answer is: time. That is, aside from dealing with systems composed of more moving parts than physics or chemistry, biology is also less open to direct manipulation and experiments take, on average, much longer for the amount of information gained. Eventually, though, I don&#x27;t doubt that we will understand biology as well as we understand the other two. At the moment we&#x27;re in the &quot;alchemy&quot; stage of biological research. We have a sense that there are units of action and rules governing these units, but we don&#x27;t know what those units are or how they interact. A rock you dig up from the ground is, also, a rather complex system difficult to understand until you have knowledge of chemicals, molecules, bonding, etc. We just need to figure out what the &quot;atoms&quot; of biology are.",1393229300

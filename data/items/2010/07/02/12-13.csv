1480948,comment,1480773,1480913,0,0,mgkimsal,,,"As another poster just put - credit.  We accept the concept of 'buying on credit' for just about every other aspect of our lives, but somehow phones are exempt.<p>We could probably get cars subsidized if we agreed to only purchase gas for a Ford from Mobil stations, and Toyotas could only by gas at BP stations.  But why would we accept that?<p>More to the point, if phones/service was truly split up, and the majority of people bought there items separately, there would be more competition to drive phone prices down.<p>Local BestBuy here has a Spring Palm Pre - the older 8gb model - for (IIRC) $99 - but buying it without the 2 year service agreement, the 'suggested retail price' is $749.  But it's <i>still</i> locked down - I can't buy it and use it on anything <i>except</i> Sprint, and I can't get any service from Sprint except for a 2 year service agreement anyway (IIRC).<p>What's also interesting is that the 'retail' price of the Pre seems to have gone up over time - last summer I could swear it was $599 or $649.  It was $749 checking today.<p>Yes, Sprint may be a bad example here, but the gist is the same.  If the voice service plans truly are subsidizing the cheap prices, give me an option to buy a full price phone and get service <i>without</i> the monthly service subsidy built in.  My $39 voice plan should be $29 or $24 monthly if I'm not having to subsidize the phone price purchase.<p>In the Pre example, there's ostensibly a $650 'subsidy' for the Palm Pre, but I still can't get a used Pre and set it up with Sprint and get a cheaper 'unsubsidized' service plan.  Over 2 years, I should be able to save $27/month without having to subsidize the original phone purchase price.<p>We're not given those options because the status quo is a combination which maximizes profit for the companies <i>and</i> presents the biggest barriers to people switching or canceling service.",1278075454

Credit is (too) easily available and basically guaranteed to be cheaper and more flexible if you unbundle it from the actual purchase. These disguised loans should really only be attractive to people with low incomes and terrible credit ratings, and they will be taken advantage of because they have no other options.<p>The fact that you seem to be repulsed by the idea of paying amount $X for a phone, but think that paying that exact same sum, plus interest, plus hidden markup is acceptable as long as it's made complicated and so hidden in plain view is mind-boggling to me.",1278074981

Diaspora's nodes seems to be both server and client, but the mechanics are the same. When it receives a message, it's just like a IRC client, and when it sends a message it is like an IRC server.<p>Unless each physical server is overloaded with busy nodes, I think it will scale well. There is a limit to how many friends that subscribe to an average user.<p>A possible improvement could be to have ""repeater"" nodes for popular users with tens of thousands of readers. Instead of sending 20.000 messages, you only send messages to 2-3 repeaters for example. The subscribers would be connected to the repeater node, and not the original node. I imagine that this could be controlled by setting a privacy level on your messages. Public messages would go to the repeaters, while private messages would be sent directly to your closest friends and family",1278074976

You can write PHP code in any editor or environment you want. Emacs? Vim? Notepad? nano? Who cares? Whatever floats your boat. Being a stupid language also means that everyone knows it. ""<p>The author didn't spend a lot of time talking about learning PHP because there's not much to learn. There's nothing surprising in the components in the PHP stack. If you know HTML, adding PHP has low overhead. DB reads and writes are simple. If you can program in another language, you know all of the logic statements you need to write an application. If you need an example, there are probably tens of thousands of bad PHP tutorials online with bad sample code that still manages to work.<p>I've learned PHP and Common Lisp from scratch at different points in my life, and PHP had a much lower barrier to entry. I installed and configured PHP on my local machine and made a stats-tracking webpage all on the same day. This was my first server-side web application ever, plus my first database program ever.<p>Fast forward 4 years, and I worked through ""ANSI Common Lisp"" for a month before I felt comfortable writing regular applications in Lisp. Then I installed Hunchentoot and stumbled around for a while, but was able to figure out how to generate static content. Most of the Hunchentoot tutorials online were for older versions, but I found one that proved invaluable. I then ended up patching S-XML, because it was only written to support 5 or 6 of the 250+ ""&amp;"" style HTML character codes. I sent that patch to the mailing list, but I bet nobody ever got it. I tried to hook up a database, and found Postmodern, which was nice. Thank God I already knew Emacs, but I wasted more than a day fighting with upgrading SLIME and SBCL at the same time.<p>The Common Lisp path doesn't sound so bad, but compare it to my PHP experience - I wrote an application on the <i>same day</i> I first looked at PHP. By the time I was integrating Database code, I was well over a month into learning Common Lisp.",1278073194

The government-financed loans were an enabler, but people were using over-the-counter CDS' to short those loans (i.e. more than one ""insurance policy"" could exist per loan and it would be hard to even know who all had them unless the loan defaulted), rating agencies get paid by those they rate so they gave artificially good ratings, etc., etc.  It was a perfect storm but to put the blame on those ""darn irresponsible poor people"" is so simplistic as to be absurd.<p>>shift regulation from capping what banks and mutual funds can do to making sure they aren't committing fraud.<p>There are many reason for the regulation on banks and mutual funds.  It's not to make the country more socialist, it's to prevent short term focused bankers/fund managers from accidentally destroying the whole economy or pissing away thousands of people's retirement.<p>>The government exists to protect private property, life, and to prosecute those who commit fraud.<p>What about dealing with monopolies?

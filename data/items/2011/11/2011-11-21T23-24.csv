A better maps app?<p>How about Google Voice?  I sure hope that in 10 years the phone network has been subsumed by the Internet, and that the days of stupid roaming and SMS charges is behind us.<p>What did Apple do when Google tried to launch a Google Voice app for the iPhone?  Rejected it from the App Store.  That was the moment when I realized that Android was totally necessary for Google to not be at the mercy of its competitors.",1321919976

The truth of the matter is nobody should care. Why should anyone care what sexual persuasion people have? It's about the music, and Freddie would have been the first to say that. He never hid the fact that he was turned on by men instead of by women, but strange enough, I don't think it was always the case. Because in the early days, we used to share rooms. So in the early days, I know who Freddie slept with, and they weren't men, but I think it gradually changed. And I have no idea how these things work, but it wasn't really anybody's business but his, and we never talked about it as if it were important. Why should it be important? We just made music together.'""<p>quoted from <a href=""http://m.npr.org/news/front/128935865?singlePage=true"" rel=""nofollow"">http://m.npr.org/news/front/128935865?singlePage=true</a>",1321919912

I think they only do the iPhone checkout thing when you do a large purchase.<p>My experience standing in line at an Apple Store has been very bad. Perhaps worse than any retail store I can recall. By not having a clear line the customer is left confused.  What am I supposed to do if I want to buy a mouse?  If the store's not busy you're set. If it is busy you have to try and grab an employee, who's undoubtedly busy helping another customer already. Then they tell you to stand in the line.  Except that the front cash register area is both a cash register and a work station. So you might be standing in line and the two people in front of you are getting repairs. So you wait 15 minutes to buy a mouse.<p>A busy Apple Store feels like a DMV to me. There are numerous customers standing around waiting to be helped, but there is no clear way to get a ticket, as there at least is at a DMV.",1321919857

Children should not be involuntary slaves to their parents.<p>> People who lived before us created a system where rights are protected and, when you reach the age of majority, you have the option of participating in governance either by voting, or running for office or other political action (this is all assuming you live in a Western style democratic republic).<p>Being able to participate in governance through voting does not negate the fact that being bound by the vote's decision is something that is forced upon you, and isn't imposed on you by consent. You either agree to the vote's result or you are forcibly jailed or executed if caught deviating from what was agreed by the voting system imposed on you.<p>> I am not sure where you get the idea that you are being violently coerced into living in civilized society and thereby following the pre-existing laws, simply because you never signed a contract or, equivalently, expressly consenting that you would.<p>If you don't follow the law and you are caught, you will be forcibly jailed or executed, or some other punishment inflicted upon you by force. It's a fact that law is upheld by force, and the vote that created the law is imposed on you by force. You have no choice whether or not to be bound by the vote's decision. You never consented to be bound by it.<p>> Contracts are a legal convenience.<p>This is self-evidently false. Individuals may make agreements between them without any involvement of a 3rd party.<p>> A convenience whos very enforcement is dictated by the laws that you rail against for not having explicitly agreed to them. A bit of a chicken and egg problem, wouldn't you agree?<p>Enforcing agreements does not necessitate a State enforcing them.<p>> What is your alternative to expecting people to live by certain rules that their ancestors through their previous political action put in place?<p>To live by rules that I consented to, and not to initiate force on another individual except in self-defense.",1321919263

innovation is that It Is capable of sensing mare than one point of

How do we take money out of politics?<p>First we overturn the Citizens United ruling and end corporate personhood or at least restrict what constitutes free speech for corporations. As long as money is considered speech in politics we'll have trouble.<p>The problem with this is that money actually can be speech. We vote with our wallet all the time. So how can we stop this without unintended side effects?<p>Government sponsored campaigns and strict limits on contributions is probably the most common sense and easy way to do this. A system where there is a limit to campaign expenses and the government subsidizes candidates that doesn't have as much money as their opponent up to the limit is a good plan. I know some states are trying to enact policies in that vein. I hope more do and succeed.",1321918341

If someone claims they can fix burn out by taking a walk or a getting a nap, they're not burnt out. You are burnt out when having hard time not just doing your work, but also when trying to recuperate. Basically, that ""wrong reason"" depresses you, making recovery very hard.

It seems such a strange complaint since people are not only able to leave at any time but there are many other cyberworlds they could inhabit alternatively, and many they can even create themselves to their own specifications and desires. There is no need to be unhappy with the offerings of a giant multinational conglomerate run by a cynical sociopath with publicly stated contempt for his customers in an age of freedom and choice.<p>I'd rather save criticism of this fabulously wealthy conglomerate to be directed at the disturbing ways they are trying to claim ownership of things outside their Matrix, such as that of my personal identity, and to track my comings and goings outside their Matrix without my consent.

Of course, leaks are nothing new (for example, the Pentagon Papers). But if you have technology which allows instantaneous transmission and replication of data around the world, then governments will have a hard job of keeping secrets from their citizens except for very short periods of time. In the same way that that the internet is destroying the record business - despite their attempts to hold back the tide through legislation - the same technology is destroying the secrets business, both public and private.",1292504388

Currently I have my children in a private school on the basis that its ""the best I can do for them now"" - ie small class sizes, larger resources than a normal school. Whilst this is working out 'ok' I do feel that the idea of teaching children in a traditional manner - ie knowledge transfer from a person at the front - is wasteful.  Outside of school I try to get them to solve problems by discovering their own solutions.  I've looked at home schooling, but they would lose the social aspect.  Its an area I'm just starting to explore, to find ""a better way"" so would welcome any comments, ideas, sites etc that people know of for an alternative way to traditional schooling.  I do understand this is slightly different to the topic that has been started, but it still fits within the same area - that of innovation",1292504183

2011842,comment,2011805,2011805,0,0,shawndumas,,,"Steven Jobs says:<p>""I used to think that technology could help education. I've probably spearheaded giving away more computer equipment to schools than anybody else on the planet. But I've had to come to the inevitable conclusion that the problem is not one that technology can hope to solve. What's wrong with education cannot be fixed with technology. No amount of technology will make a dent.<p>It's a political problem. The problems are sociopolitical. The problems are unions. You plot the growth of the NEA [National Education Association] and the dropping of SAT scores, and they're inversely proportional. The problems are unions in the schools. The problem is bureaucracy. I'm one of these people who believes the best thing we could ever do is go to the full voucher system.<p>I have a 17-year-old daughter who went to a private school for a few years before high school. This private school is the best school I've seen in my life. It was judged one of the 100 best schools in America. It was phenomenal. The tuition was $5,500 a year, which is a lot of money for most parents. But the teachers were paid less than public school teachers - so it's not about money at the teacher level. I asked the state treasurer that year what California pays on average to send kids to school, and I believe it was $4,400. While there are not many parents who could come up with $5,500 a year, there are many who could come up with $1,000 a year.<p>If we gave vouchers to parents for $4,400 a year, schools would be starting right and left. People would get out of college and say, ""Let's start a school."" You could have a track at Stanford within the MBA program on how to be the businessperson of a school. And that MBA would get together with somebody else, and they'd start schools. And you'd have these young, idealistic people starting schools, working for pennies.<p>They'd do it because they'd be able to set the curriculum. When you have kids you think, What exactly do I want them to learn? Most of the stuff they study in school is completely useless. But some incredibly valuable things you don't learn until you're older - yet you could learn them when you're younger. And you start to think, What would I do if I set a curriculum for a school?<p>God, how exciting that could be! But you can't do it today. You'd be crazy to work in a school today. You don't get to do what you want. You don't get to pick your books, your curriculum. You get to teach one narrow specialization. Who would ever want to do that?<p>These are the solutions to our problems in education. Unfortunately, technology isn't it. You're not going to solve the problems by putting all knowledge onto CD-ROMs. We can put a Web site in every school - none of this is bad. It's bad only if it lulls us into thinking we're doing something to solve the problem with education.<p>Lincoln did not have a Web site at the log cabin where his parents home-schooled him, and he turned out pretty interesting. Historical precedent shows that we can turn out amazing human beings without technology. Precedent also shows that we can turn out very uninteresting human beings with technology.<p>It's not as simple as you think when you're in your 20s - that technology's going to change the world. In some ways it will, in some ways it won't.""

Our app generally needs messages to persist until they are consumed.<p>What I can say however is that none of the concerns we initially had about performance/scalability held any water.<p>We are still running on a single redis instance (plus a slave) on a moderately sized server and it happily processes 100 messages/sec average between 4 producers and a varying number of consumers (20-100).<p>To add insult to injury our monitoring metrics show that this isn't even a worthwhile load for redis. The server is nowhere near breaking a sweat, the CPUs barely drop below 90% idle, there's no disk i/o to speak of, and the memory usage is more than reasonable (plenty headroom for our purposes).<p>Thus ""just throw it at redis"" has long become a common stopgap meme in this particular project.

2011756,comment,2010367,2010847,0,0,gjm11,,,"This will not ""block the sun from any angle"". Not unless you make it block all light from any angle. If I'm understanding your proposal, what it will do if it works is to block all light that enters the window perpendicularly (and at certain other angles), whether it comes from the sun or not; but if you happen not to be looking straight at the window, there's no guarantee that the sun will be blocked. And if you <i>are</i> looking straight at the window, you won't see anything.<p>There's nothing magical about sunlight that will enable you to block it while letting in other light from the same direction. And light from the sun could reach the window at a wide range of different directions.<p>(If you somehow contrive to have the sun always in the same direction -- say you're in a spaceship and it keeps a consistent orientation relative to the sun -- then this kind of thing could work. Not so feasible here on earth, though.)",1292500975

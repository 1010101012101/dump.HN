I've read about twenty books in the last two years, and have been pretty happy with the combination of iPhone (for night time, car, casual) and Kindle (Bright Sunlight, camping, desert) devices.<p>But, The kindle/iPhone really are only good for light fiction.  They are horrible for Scientific Texts, Math Texts, Anything with color, and reference manuals.  I've been waiting for 18+ months for the MacTablet to come out, and, if something like Bilo is available with it's release, and manages to come up with a half decent/fast metaphor for random page turning (needed for a reference) - then it will be a hit.<p>Though, I have a sneaking suspicion Apple might also have an interest in being the ""Ebook Reader"" of choice for the MacTablet...",1262155554

If you're at an organization large enough to have its own HR department, delicately mention that you might have to speak with them regarding whether discounting the degree is on the permitted side of their ""national origin"" clause.

1022078,comment,1020568,1021103,0,0,jacoblyles,,,"Culturally, the Christian world seems to have given up its war against the infidels a few hundred years ago (today, it is even close to giving up Christianity). While hostility towards outsiders may not be a necessary part of Muslim belief, it does seem to be ingrained in at least a substantial part of current Islamic culture.<p>The Crusades are an off-mentioned bugbear on the lips of moral relativists, and of course the Bible claims that the Hebrews drove out pagan tribes from the land of Cainaan. But in my opinion we ought to weight recent killings in the name of God slightly higher than those which occurred five hundred or three thousand years ago.<p>I could be wrong and biased because of the media I consume.

Basically, it's Zipcar except you can park in any public parking space instead of having to return it to the spot where you picked it up. It looks like they're trying to make most of their money from corporate contracts, such as the City of Austin, which is the only customer during the pilot phase. They're probably also writing some of it off as advertising. It's run by Daimler and all the cars are Smart Fortwos, which I see pretty much every day now. It's not open to the public yet in Austin, but between that, the bus and a folding bike to make half car2go, half bike trips more feasible, I wouldn't need my rarely used car at all.<p><a href=""http://www.car2go.com/portal/austin/page/mybookings/mapEnlarged.faces"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.car2go.com/portal/austin/page/mybookings/mapEnlar...</a>",1262154556

I spent a bunch of money playing Smash TV back in about 1992 and this is a lot of the same fun gameplay and a couple of similar graphics. A couple of suggestions:<p>* Make the weapon recharge happen automatically when the level clears or you die, so the player doesn't have to stand there and wait for the recharge.<p>* Disable the traps after all regular enemies are dead. There is no additional challenge or fun from killing a few slugs while you run around and collect your big prizes.<p>* Automatically do something sensible with charge ups and get rid of the store and equipment screen altogether. The fun factor of shopping is not high.<p>* Make a big cursor indicator so it's easier to see the player and the target at the same time using peripheral vision.<p>* I would get rid of falling off the edge.<p>* I kept hitting the map button on E by accident and I want to move it.",1262153997

The problem is not the legal framework it is rather the <i>policing</i> that is the problem. Laws per se do not stop criminal activity.

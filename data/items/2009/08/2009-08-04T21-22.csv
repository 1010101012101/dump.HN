For many Americans, the reality of ever needing to speak any language but English seems totally theoretical, whether for travel, business, or profession.  For many Europeans, needing to speak a non-native language appears much more realistic.  Further complicating this is that if one's native language is English, then it DOES work almost all the time, reinforcing the notion that foreign languages are merely decorative.  By contrast, if you were a Dutch computer scientist like Dijkstra, you would understand very early that you could never hope to write professional papers in Dutch.  (Brits have the advantage of seeing that other languages really are used, but share the disadvantage of already being fluent in what is nearly a world language.)",1249422034

742264,comment,741895,741895,0,0,adamt,,,"At various times I've profiled some CPU bound code and thought malloc is taking too much time.  This has led me to read up on, and try and develop various usage-optimised allocators. The one lesson I've learnt is that in most cases the standard libc allocator is actually extremely good.<p>Where I have had big advantages over libc malloc is where the memory allocations have been specific to a thread context. For example, consider a multi-threaded server, where by you could guarantee that only one thread was active in a connection at anyone time. It's quite easy for a single connection to spend 5-10% of it's time in malloc and there are often big globalish locks around general purpose allocators, so it's easy to get get mutex contention which is far worse than the overhead of a sub-efficient allocator.<p>In such cases you often need to have small bits of memory within the context of a connection.  Here I found big benefits my mallocing memory in bug chunks and then simply splitting that up into small sections within a connection specific allocator to avoid any malloc mutex locking.<p>What I've found is that in order to beat normal malloc, I think you really have to have a specific usage case that restricts something to do better.",1249421900

One established company wants to help us build it, in return for an exclusivity deal.  What are the gotchas?  How do we avoid getting screwed?<p>Long version:<p>My partner and I want to bring a new technology (mobile devices) to an existing industry which currently isn't using it, but we believe definitely will be using it in a few years' time.  We've spent the last month knocking on doors, trying to gauge interest, and to define what shape a solution might take - basically, doing Customer Discovery.  There is definitely interest, the industry feels that the times are changing, but isn't exactly sure how that change will happen, and enthusiasm has varied wildly between different companies.<p>My partner and I are both tech people, and we have very limited domain knowledge - we're learning and making contacts as we go, but we started from zero a couple months ago.  We're also trying to bootstrap as far as possible.<p>I had a meeting today with the first company that was truly enthusiastic about what we're proposing.    They ""got it"" right away, and proposed a partnership to build the solution we have in mind.    They are willing to bring their expertise and domain knowledge to the table (they've been around for 15 years), but in return, they want some form of (time-limited) exclusivity.  They are basically seeing the same opportunity we are seeing, and want to use it to grow and position themselves as a leader - and are happy to work with us as partners, but (naturally) not as competitors.<p>Depending on the terms of the agreement (we'd want a good lawyer on our side, of course), there could be significant upsides.  They would effectively become our first (large) client.  We could use their expertise to build a product that makes sense, and their reputation and sales channels to push it into the market - these are certainly not our strengths.  Our interests would be aligned in the sense that they would want to push as many sales as possible - thus growing both our businesses.<p>The part I'm nervous about is:  we're a two-person startup with no funding, they're an established midsize company.  How do we make sure we don't get screwed?<p>What are the downsides and hidden gotchas to something like this?",1249421771

IT support requirements are siphoning limited resources away from my organization’s core business activities.""<p>Even if your main business is in the IT field, supporting it is always going to siphon away resources without directly generating revenue (unless you happen to sell support contracts, and even then your INTERNAL IT support is pure overhead) and those resources are always limited.<p>A more useful phrasing would be:
""IT support could be more effeciently and cost effectively provided by another company.""<p>This is certainly true for many companies, but also certainly not true for others.<p>This statement though is a good one:
""9.

They love it.<p>I wanted to tell you guys a story though, about your UI transition.<p>I walked in a few months ago to my 8 year old daughter slumped at the desk next to her computer, nonresponsive. When I was like ""Oh my God, are you okay?"" She told me, with many tears, that she was no longer to obtain I believe they were called ""Master"" badges in some future subjects, like Geometry.<p>She had earned one of the Master badges at great effort, and when the UI changed, you guys retired them for more granular badges. Overall, I'd say it was the right decision to make; gaining subject mastery is done on a smaller slice of content now, and feels more achievable.<p>That said, she was totally devastated that she wouldn't be able to earn those future badges. Oh man, it was tough. She recovered nicely and loves the new interface, but I was thinking what an impact a UI change had, and thinking that a) probably many adults feel the same way with a change, but don't communicate it as well, and b) some sort of way to notify / slowly introduce / help transition kids who use the tool intimately as changes happen would be pretty awesome.<p>Thanks for all the work! I wish I'd taken some video for your UI guys, she was really bummed, the sort of response you can't get out of a focus group. :)",1340924132

4174370,comment,4171797,4173015,5,0,A1kmm,,,"Under New Zealand law, courts must consider whether evidence was collected illegally when deciding if it admissible in court, but that doesn't automatically prevent evidence from being admissible. If the breach was minor, technical, and unintentional, and doesn't significantly affect the rights of the defendant beyond if the law had been followed, then the evidence is usually considered admissible. If the courts decide that the police deliberately broke the law, they are far more likely to rule evidence inadmissible.<p>So this does not necessarily mean that he has won the extradition hearing.<p>The actual ruling (here <a href=""http://www.courtsofnz.govt.nz/cases/dotcom-ors-v-attorney-general/at_download/fileDecision"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.courtsofnz.govt.nz/cases/dotcom-ors-v-attorney-ge...</a>) was based on the argument by Kim Dotcom's lawyers that the search warrants were too vague and broad (they didn't say they were for alleged breaches of US law, they allowed too much stuff to be seized beyond the alleged offending, they didn't say how seized property that turned out to be irrelevant or was no longer needed for the investigation should be dealt with, and they didn't say how property belonging to employees living at Kim Dotcom's house would be handled) and the fact that the NZ Police had allowed evidence to be transferred overseas without permission from the Attorney General as required by law.<p>The court ruled that because the search warrants were too broad, they were invalid, and therefore the seizure was illegal.<p>Under New Zealand law, people generally get property that was seized for investigation back, unless there is a law specifically allowing it to be kept.<p>They didn't rule that all seized property must be returned yet, but the ruling grants ""an order requiring that all items identified as containing no relevant material be returned forthwith to the plaintiffs"" and ""an order that complete clones of those seized items which are found to contain any relevant and non-privileged material be provided to the plaintiffs as soon as possible, and in any case, not later than the disclosable clone of that item is provided to the United States authorities"".<p>Disclaimer: IANAL, this is not legal advice, it is a political discussion about seizure laws in relation to a high profile case.",1340924023

It has progressed rapidly on other fronts. Anyone looking at the Apollo program should realize that it was a stunt more than a true exploratory endeavor. In the past 40 years we've been doing the real work of increasing our understanding of everything in the solar system.

He describes it's uniqueness:<p><i>People have survived for months on the open ocean, subsisting on the elements around them. Running out of air is not a problem. Fresh water falls out of the sky as rain. Critters that are attracted to the cover of your life raft provide a source of food. I recommend the book 117 Days Adrift for a gripping account of a British couple who survived such an ordeal. Sometimes edible fish would actually jump into their dinghy. By contrast, a hamburger has never slammed into the side of the space shuttle in orbit</i><p>True, but hamburgers don't slam into the side of an airplane either. Yet we don't starve to death in airplanes despite many airlines attempts.<p>The voyages of Columbus were all expensive stunts and economic failures. It was 100 years before practical use of the new world was possible. Once the cost of a colony could be reasonably amortized and profitable they sprung up everywhere. Better technology made this possible, not larger government trips to farther off destinations.<p>Space is already being commercialized. We aren't mining asteroids yet, but we are seeing private launch companies sending private satellites into orbit. The costs of launches are going down, and the value in space is going up.

Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) have similar properties as graphene (act as a metal or a semiconductor, are the ""strongest materials known, etc.[1]).<p>From what I understand, it is very difficult to make large sections of pure graphene or long CNTs. As long as they're pure, they remain strong, and therein lies the difficulty of graphene and CNT production. Like you said, the impurities do weaken CNTs and graphene. The impurities can be contaminants which occupy a carbon location, or missing carbon atoms, forcing the lattice to reconstruct. According to [1], this can lower the tensile strength of a carbon nanotube by up to 85%. The problem with manufacturing long CNTs and large areas of graphene is that it is thermodynamically impossible to, on a large scale, have a perfect lattice. The imperfections will weaken the entire structure.

While they both work by storing lists, there's a big difference for me between tasks and items in a list. When I'm tracking tasks, I want things organized based on timeframes (maybe also assigning priorities, due dates, or categories), and an interface designed around that principle is always going to do that better; you could use Clear or Cheddar to store ""Today"", ""Tomorrow"", and ""Soon"" lists, but that's a poor hack. When I'm simply maintaining a list of things to remember (e.g., grocery list, debts to friends, items I need to buy after moving, songs to buy, 100 push-ups program), all I want is several (separate) lists with items I can add, edit, rearrange, and delete.<p>I currently use Any.do as my tasks app and Clear as my list app. I really like the design of both of them, but I have reservations of both. Any.do takes a very nice approach of sorting tasks into bins of Today, Tomorrow, This Week, and Later, but aggressively bubbles tasks up (the idea is nice if Tomorrow tasks moved into Today after a day, and This Week into Tomorrow after 6 days, and Later always stayed in Later, but I've had to push the same tasks back into Later and This Week 4+ times per week). Clear lacks syncing of any kind -- this is extremely frustrating because it could easily hook into something like SimpleNote. I really like the focus on syncing from Cheddar, but I have major reservations about the subscription concept (even though experience shows that I move between these apps frequently and will likely not need to pay for many months, a subscription feels like a significant investment whereas a <$5 app doesn't), and I find myself missing Any.do and Clear's gestures.",1340922785

For instance: Kim Dotcom was personally involved in a customer support case wherein a complaint was heard about the video quality of uploads of Showtime's hit series ""Dexter""; Dotcom is later observed in Mega emails to be reacting to the complaint by working on improving the video quality. In another similar case, a customer complained to Dotcom about a message from the site they received while watching uploads of ""Mythbusters""; Dotcom verified the site was functioning correctly (the site was enforcing bandwidth limits; it was of no concern to Dotcom that the site was also obviously trafficking in infringing content). This is part of a repeating pattern of support and maintenance and logistics email threads Dotcom participated in that make it clear what the site is actually being used for.<p>That's obviously just Dotcom. When you broaden the inquiry to Mega's key employees, you find instances of them directly handling and uploading infringing content to the site.<p>Most damning from what I can read is the details of the affiliate program. In emails discovered by the DOJ, we have line-by-line accounting of Mega issuing payouts to people in which the <i>actual line items</i> specify that the activity being rewarded is infringing.<p>All of these, obviously, are cases in which Mega is shown to have actual, specific, actionable knowledge of infringing activity on their site. Rather than acting to retard infringement on the site, they are shown to abet it, groom it, and in many cases incentivize it financially.<p>All this should be obvious to anyone involved trying to run a content company on the Internet, of which there are many on HN. Does money fall out of the sky the moment you open a content site? No it does not. Most content companies fail, and portfolios are littered with the bones of companies that tried to make a go of file hosting.<p>What made Mega so profitable? Come on.

It isn't enough just to wait for copyright holders to send takedowns.<p>> By actively courting piracy, MegaUpload forfeited safe harbor protections.<p>You are segueing between talking about DMCA ""red flag"" knowledge and the inducement standard from <i>Grokster</i> in a rather confusing way.<p>If we're talking about DMCA ""red flags"", one needs knowledge (not foreknowledge) of <i>specific acts of infringement</i>, not merely knowledge of infringement in general[1].  There may have been an email proving that, as it's been quite some time since I read the indictment, but I don't remember one offhand involving Kim Dotcom himself.  Then you talk about something that sounds like inducement.  That's something the Supreme Court invented in <i>Grokster</i> and it's a different standard altogether.  It's a theory of vicarious liability that relies on ""purposeful, culpable expression and conduct"" while ""mere knowledge of infringing potential or of actual infringing uses would not be enough here to subject a distributor to liability."" [2]<p>I should also point out that Viacom had some incriminating emails from YouTube staff, which I believe you can find in some of the old Ars coverage of that case, but which I don't know the proper link to.  But YouTube largely won the perception battle because of the obvious non-infringing uses of the site and because they went well above and beyond their DMCA obligations (though Viacom still sued them).<p>Mega is losing the same battle of perception because almost all of the non-infringing uses of their site were <i>private</i> (people sharing files among friends, rather than with the general public), while all infringing uses of the site were necessarily public.  So even if they had a million innocent users and a thousand pirates, you'd only see all the files put up by the pirates and the million users would be largely invisible, because they had no interest in sharing their home movies (or whatever) with the world.<p>[1] ""UMG v.

1532426,comment,1531843,1532229,0,0,rick888,,,"""How many people here on HN have used pirated software to help build a web app? Quite a few I'd bet. If your fledging web app is a success, whose software are you gonna buy when you are successful? The one you 'test-drove' as a pirate of course. ""<p>Possibly. But there aren't really any real stats to back this up.<p>""Why do you think the tech industry and the web grew out of America and not some other wealthy country? It's because America tolerates a certain amount of rebellious, anti-authoritarian behavior (among other things).""<p>The GPL is becoming its own dictatorship and when people like Chris from thesis go against the ideals, he is treated like a criminal.  The GPL is no different than proprietary software licenses.  Companies and people involved in both want people to abide by their rules.  However, only one seems to be supported here on HN and other communities.  It's very hypocritical and it's one of the reasons why I can't take the community seriously.<p>""I'm not pro-piracy per se, but I believe a certain amount has to be tolerated as the alternative is a police state on the web.""<p>This is a little extreme.  The alternative is not a ""police state"".  The alternative is respecting someone's rights, even if you don't agree with it (don't pirate something you don't want to pay for).",1279641594

1532422,comment,1531004,1532112,0,0,nooneelse,,,"This would be so very easy to push down the obvious slippery slope.  Imagine a movie with a progression... painting of a nude male and female, then a picture of the subjects of that painting, then a sequence of paintings of them going from something like a slide-show with a transition every 10 seconds to a couple paintings per second so they do a little stop-motion dance.  Then repeat the slide-show with pictures of the subjects.  Next introduce another layer, a shot of a TV showing the painting, then the pictures... how can you tell the difference between the TV showing picture of the nudes and a paused video of the nudes?  What if two people repeatedly hold up a black sheet in front of the two nudes while they are moving and then drop the sheet for a second as the nudes hold still... how is that different from the slide-show of the pictures of those nudes.  All this could be done integrated with the plot and dialogue, maybe something about what is real and how you tell the difference between a real and fake photo/video of something.<p>So in the progressions, when would the censors put the black boxes over the ""naughty"" bits?  Would there be a difference in that for the man and the woman?",1279641536

I already mentioned Disciplined Disciple Compiler that extends Haskell to give static guarantees for following certain rules for resource management.<p>Why would you bother: RAII only covers some cases for resource management, and most garbage collectors can take an arbitrary long time to collect an object that's no longer reachable.

The vendors of our two most critical systems decided on JVM based languages - Java and Groovy - so we're moving in their direction.<p>Java is new to most of my department. Currently people use C, SQL, and PL/SQL. I started with Java in 1998: it's not very exciting for me anymore. I'd like to use languages with greater abstraction capabilities. Despite being a really attractive language, Clojure is a tough sell because of its Lisp-like syntax: being a JVM-based language I can probably still get it in house for small apps.<p>Haskell, however, is non-JVM and has unique features by comparison with Java. This combination make it impossible to make an argument for despite all the goodness that it has. Unfortunately for me, it's relegated to the category of a language I'll play with periodically and someday hopefully use in industry.",1279641413

Besides, how many GPL forks of BSD projects are there? There are many more proprietary forks of BSD projects.

I said that your licensing is hostile to '""free software"" folks', in other words, people who refer to what they do as ""free software"". jQuery's licensing isn't hostile to them because it allows them to freely incorporate it into their projects to the same extent it allows proprietary projects to do so.

This particular case is a really bad example of the “war on photography” because the motorcyclist is not an innocent photographer but a traffic provocateur.<p>Like many, I've followed Radley Balko's articles for some time and have a growing sense of paranoia/constitutional outrage regarding false arrest. I think there are a couple of interesting phenomena here. Some folks may not like the two ideas below but I offer them as a conversation starter for understanding what is happening instead of just venting outrage (which is cool too).<p>1.) Growing ubiquity of recording equipment formerly thought of as ""surveillance equipment.” In the not distant past, very small cameras were specialty equipment only available to certain people. In that time, the common thinking was that a person should have some highly-motivated intent for using such stuff because it was very expensive and if you weren't in law enforcement or a PI, then your use was probably not for good.<p>2.) Law is complex and large, so law enforcement uses some heuristic of propriety instead of actual laws. My impression is that law enforcement people contain a large but not all-encompassing menu of crimes and use some form of pattern matching to compare the behavior of other humans to this menu. Since it is inefficient to compare every rule to each encounter with other people, law enforcement people use the general feeling they get from an encounter to first signal that something is ""wrong"" and then guide them to a particular item from the crime menu or reach into the foggier area of laws off their personal menu.<p>Fitting idea 1 with idea 2, it makes sense that there would be an unofficial ""war on recording"" by law enforcement as the propriety value of the law heuristic is driven in part by cultural values which in turn are slowly influenced by technology. In this case, technology change has occurred more quickly than many people’s sense of probity.",1279639248

1532252,comment,1531882,1531882,0,0,jerf,,,"This is yet another ""monad"" that can't do the list monad, and is not therefore actually a monad. The function passed to bind may be called zero times, once, or n times. (Or perhaps rather, any number of times, but I think phrasing it this way underscores the place where many putative monads fall down.)<p>I mention this because this is actually critical to understanding the nature of Monads, it's not just an incidental point.<p>One way of understanding Monads is that they turn everything that would be a ""statement"" in most languages into a ""function"", and these functions are nested in each other. (Well, arguably this is what it <i>is</i>, but it's not necessarily the <i>best</i> understanding. It is in my opinion the best start, though; at least it leaves you with a true understanding, even if all the clever tricks aren't obvious yet.) Statement one actually calls into statement two calls into statement three, etc. The Maybe monad works by taking these functions (the collection of which constitute the ""monadic value""), but wrapping it in a check for Nothing, and if you have a Nothing it simply returns Nothing. This has two effects: It returns Nothing, and because it stopped calling down the function chain, it stops ""executing"" your monadic value. Otherwise it extracts the value from its wrapper and ""keeps going"" into (not down, <i>into</i>; each bind or <- is a nested function call) the rest of the monadic value.<p>The List monad works by taking each element for a given line in sequence, then calling the remainder of the monadic value, hence the classic<p><pre><code>   cartesian_closure = do\n       a <- [1, 2, 3]\n       b <- [4, 5, 6]\n       return (a, b)\n</code></pre>\nwhich will return<p><pre><code>   [(1,4),(1,5),(1,6),(2,4),(2,5),(2,6),(3,4),(3,5),(3,6)]\n</code></pre>\nSee how we start with 1 for ""a"", then ""call"" the remainder of the Monadic value, which itself starts with 4 for ""b"" and proceeds on, and so forth. The bind function for the list monad is responsible for poking through the list like this.<p>By turning ""statements"" into ""functions"" which are then something we can manipulate like any other functions, Monads provide the ""programmable semicolon"" functionality, though this isn't the <i>best</i> way to understand them.<p>(This is why the State monad is pure, not ""cheated imperative"". It takes the old functional paradigm of passing down a state value as a parameter to a series of recursive functions, and abstracts out that parameter. It's exactly the same as the ""old"" functional answer, just spelled differently.)<p>(Edit: This still glosses over some things because it's a post, not a place I can spend three hours polishing. I hesitate to add another ""monad tutorial"" to the intarwebs...)",1279638493

If the UI is too crippled to do what the user needs to do, they are powerless. An intersection must be found, where power emerges from simplicity.",1279638247

If drugs are to be illegal, the sensible thing is to punish production and sale. Then you can develop a dynamic where a user who wants to get clean can get some kind of reward for turning in a dealer. Then dealing becomes less attractive because there's a higher likelihood of being caught. <i>Rehab the users, punish the providers</i> makes more sense to me than <i>Just punish everyone</i>.<p>2. The original point was the idea that it might be a bad idea to video tape undercover officers. I think we've managed to stray from that a bit. I don't think we should concern ourselves with worrying about such video taping: either the criminal organization already cares about such things and can get that information readily, or they don't care and getting video taped once isn't going to change anything. Getting outed as an undercover agent pretty much destroys your chance to do that again, anyways, regardless of the presence of video taping (which I wouldn't expect to actually happen much in practice in these kinds of cases).",1279638013

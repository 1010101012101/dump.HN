16120,comment,16098,16115,0,0,dfranke,,,"How are you handling atomicity?  Are you doing full-out undo/redo logging, or just something involving writing to a seperate file and then (atomically) retargeting a symlink?<p>I'm mostly an academic, so I can tell you a lot more about how things are supposed to work than about how they actually do.  The only high-traffic DBMS with real users to which I can easily get access is MS-SQL, which doesn't inspire me to any leaps of faith.  But once I finish building my new desktop system (with spiffy RAID array) I'll rig up some benchmarks on MySQL and PostgreSQL.",1177361140

Our Web servers use Linux and Apache and PHP. Our database servers run MySQL. We use memcached to help keep the site snappy. Some of our behind-the-scenes software is written in Python and Perl and Java, and we use gcc and Boost for the parts that aren't. Our developers use Subversion and git to keep track of their work. The list goes onÂ—like many Web sites, we use it from top to bottom.""",1177360636

I was under the impression that LJ was all memcached + sharding + master/master pairs for the shards.<p>How do you handle features that rely on frequent UPDATE statements, like say a hitcounter?  Is UPDATE LOW PRIORITY (MySQL) enough, or should you work out some application-specific caching/batching mechanism and perform all your updates at once?",1177360055

16110,comment,16098,16098,0,0,dfranke,,,"If your entire database fits in memory, then any decent DBMS will cache it all there, write changes back to disk at such time as to have a minimal impact on performance, all the while ensuring atomicity if someone kicks out the plug while it's in the middle of flushing the buffer.  If you're not using a DBMS and you can still say all that about your own solution, you've probably put a lot of work into reinventing the wheel.",1177359727

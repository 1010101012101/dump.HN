This best option (to me) up one step from Quickbooks/Xero looked like IntAcct. The main feature is  reasonably good automated software revenue recognition support (obviously important for a SaaS company), including good support for custom B2B deal structures.

With a reference, you have no good way of telling whether your reference IS nullable.<p>>As the article mentions, we have annotations to do just that.<p>Your mileage may vary, but my experience with nullable/nonnull annotations is that because they are not used across the board, you are either left with a ton of false positives or a ton of false negatives.  The fact that there hasn&#x27;t really been a great standardization in the core language is probably evidence of that (yes, JSR305 exists, but the JDK doesn&#x27;t enforce its constraints by default).<p>With Optional, it&#x27;s a clean slate.  You can simply say &quot;a reference to an Optional shall never be null&quot; and you could probably enable such an enforcement for an existing project.  Of course it&#x27;s not going to be 100% while it&#x27;s still a normal reference type, but catching 99% of the cases is a really big improvement!",1445878716

You have all the advantages of a traditional controller, except the camera control is much more precise and mouse-like.<p>And although the steam controller may never compete with a mouse and keyboard for games like CS:GO, r/SteamController is reporting encouraging findings, with people claiming to be surprisingly competitive using a steam controller by utilising dual aiming (trackpad for large, coarse movements and gyro for tiny correctional movements).<p>The bottom line is that for me a steam controller is a massive improvement over a traditional controller, it is like it takes the best aspects of mouse+kb and game controllers and combines them in one package.<p>Console makers should take note, but unfortunately at this point outside nintendo the traditional console makers are very unwilling to innovate with the base controller.",1445878703

I agree with Paul that &quot;fancy&quot;, &quot;formal&quot; prose like this is (randomly chosen example) does no one any favors:<p><pre><code>    > This work aims to address the disconnect between object-oriented design\n    > and implementation by rethinking the way object-oriented languages are\n    > structured. We have developed a set of requirements with which to identify\n    > good relationship models, and used these requirements to develop a\n    > new model for the object-oriented paradigm which focuses on relationships\n    > rather than objects. We will test the effectiveness of the model by designing\n    > a language which uses it, along with a formal specification and a\n    > practical implementation for the language. We will measure the effectiveness\n    > of our model by conducting case studies comparing development in\n    > existing languages with development in our relationship-based language.\n</code></pre>\nBut saying that the <i>only</i> solution is to write how you speak informally to friends also eliminates prose like:<p><pre><code>    > The tide climbs. The moon hangs small and yellow and gibbous. On the rooftops\n    > of beachfront hotels to the east, and in the gardens behind them, a half-dozen\n    > American artillery units drop incendiary rounds into the mouths of mortars.\n</code></pre>\nI don&#x27;t think Anthony Doerr uses phrases like &quot;mouths of mortars&quot; when having beer with his friends, but his prose is an absolute work of art. Every single word and dollop of punctuation there is perfect.<p>The key part is not to write like you are speaking to your friends. It&#x27;s to write <i>like you are speaking to a specific audience.</i> Have a picture in your mind of yourself speaking in a venue to one or more people. The image you have will dramatically affect the way you right.<p>Picture yourself giving a hollering a rousing speech to a platoon of soldiers about to enter into battle and your reader will hear the Battle Hymn of the Republic by the time they reach the end of your paragraph. Whisper your words into the ear of a lover and your reader will get the shivers.<p>For most of the writing we on HN do, sure, &quot;explaining something cool to your friends over lunch&quot; is exactly the right image to get your style in line. But it&#x27;s a massive over-simplification to say <i>all</i> prose should be written with tat venue in mind.<p>Personally, I think &quot;mercurial Spaniard&quot; is a great description of Picasso.",1445878645

Consider, for example, the timetable for the development and standardization of ASCII vs UTF-8, as well as trends of the use of UTF-8 in the web (vs. ASCII) and browser support for UTF-8. Western-centrism is not the result of malice, but it still happens.<p>Take Medium, for example, which launched a few years ago without proper support for RTL languages and still doesn&#x27;t do a good job at that. This is a classic trade-off you do when building an &quot;MVP&quot;. The trouble is that there is an entire ecosystem where reasonable software-engineering tradeoffs read to one culture/set of cultures being prioritized over others. Short of people of RTL cultures creating their own twitter, medium, etc., there will always be a gap.<p>Of course, Arab developers, like many others, do try hard to bridge the gap.

The only critique I could find was Rush Limbaugh saying it was “I hope this company is a case study in MBA programs on how socialism does not work, because it&#x27;s gonna fail,”, although this is not a backlash in suggesting that it should be boycotted, so if you have others it would be appreciated. Rush Limbaugh is incorrect as the community does not own the company i.e. socialism, but to be fair, there is no theory on what to call this politically; it is not communism, socialism, or any other -ism. Those in the Seattle [2] Times article suggesting &quot;backlash&quot; point to companies behaving rationally in the market expecting fee increases in the future. The alleged companies quitting usage based on political concerns is not given to a number and without direct quotes from the companies as to the reason for quitting, I find it simply a buffer for the story. An Entrepreneur critique piece specifically mentions no ill-will to the company. [3]<p>The criticism, mostly originating from Austrian based economic thought not right-wing groups (however most individuals on the right subscribe to the Austrian thought), was that the economics of the $70,000 wage was not going to end well for the company, not any suggestion of opposition to fairly paid society.<p>Comments varied between what the profit margin would be and the effect on role distinction. The main comments were how the effect would play out for those employees that the company had previously valued at $75,000 with a double pay differential from the $35,000 now having the individuals who performed the same task being given the $50,000 wage and phased up to the $70,000; eliminating the meritocracy of a $75,000 wage. Additionally, the internal machinations and reports bore out the Austrian point of view as valued employees quit citing unequal pay raise values for the lowest valued employees. [1]<p>To be fair, MarketWatch and Slate bring up a doubling in profits and revenues, but how much of this is based on an increase from the publicity and is it a long term sustainable idea.<p>Gravity Payments is profiting $2.2 million on $150 million in revenue. The Seattle Times article notes that payment processing services are razor thin margins.<p>Let&#x27;s do the following financial analysis:\n* Gravity Payments has a 1.5% profit margin at its current rate of burn, $2.2 million over $150 million.<p>* Gravity at announcement time had 120 employees, of which a documented 25% would see a double in their pay, 30 employees who were making $35,000. Estimating the rest of the company&#x27;s effected staff, estimate another 30 will be brought up to $50,000, another 20 brought up next year to $60,000 and then finally another 20 to $70,000, for a total of estimated 100 employees affected by this move.<p>* Costs have now increased for the 30 base salary employees to $1.5 million more, assuming a cost increase of $20,000 per person average for the remaining group of 70, you are an additional $1.4 million.<p>* After the full effect of the increase is factored in, the costs outweigh the current operating situation.<p>* The counter-argument of increases in business are offset by the companies need to hire additional staff to handle the increase. These individuals are brought into the existing cost structure and are not able to move the profit margin.<p>The company will be having some issues next year making good on its promise of wage increases and certainly in 2017.

10452517,comment,10451830,10452363,0,0,derefr,,,"I find it really weird that in inherently &quot;networked&quot; games (where there is a concept of a shared deterministic game-session physics-frame counter), the PC <i>playing</i> the game has to be the same PC <i>rendering</i> the game. You can recreate exactly the same view each player has from that player&#x27;s outgoing network traffic! Thus, some alternatives to rendering on the user&#x27;s own GPU come to mind:<p>1. instead of those HDMI-path recorder middleboxes, you could have an Ethernet-path renderer+recorder box and put all the heavy GPUs there. (Note that, if you don&#x27;t care about streaming precisely &quot;live&quot;, the rendering and recording no longer need to be dataflow-synchronous; you could play the whole game, buffer the network data into the rendering pipeline, and then it would sit there rendering the results for however long you wanted to give to achieve a desired &quot;quality&quot; bound. Effectively, you&#x27;re doing the same thing as people who stream their commentary of a finished match by rendering off the replay-file the match; but in this case, the &quot;replay file&quot; is streaming to the renderer as it&#x27;s being created.)<p>2. You could have an in-game option to asynchronously stream the session data to a cloud GPU instance and render the game <i>there</i>. (Or, y&#x27;know, if any of the game infrastructure providers really knew what they were doing with the Internet, they could offer those instances themselves, for a profit.)<p>3. Or, with the game studios&#x27; cooperation, just throw the whole edifice of local rendering away, capture the &quot;replay&quot; data for every match to the studio&#x27;s data-centers, and then provide a service for <i>cacheable just-in-time rendering</i> of any replay data. Effectively, the game studio would say &quot;whenever you play a match, we render a video from each player&#x27;s perspective and post it immediately&quot;—but without the need to actually do that (or keep said videos around long-term), because the video is entirely &quot;computed state&quot; that can be recreated from the replay files at any time.<p>4. One step more: a sudio could even provide an HTML5 &quot;enhanced viewer&quot; interacting with such a render-farm-backed CDN, that let people change perspective of the action themselves, to switch between the perspectives of the players and other views, sort of making such a viewer into an HTML5 thin-client for the game engine on the renderer instance (but without game-state-manipulation logic.) Imagine such a viewer as an embeddable iframe, like a YouTube video. A replay commentator could walk through a session as they would in-client to store a camera-movement-record on the server, get a permalink to the embeddable &quot;video&quot; for that, and then feed it to MashupTwitch along with commentary audio. Presuming the thing that gets embedded is an iframe <i>of the same rendering service</i>, though, any given player could &quot;break out of&quot; the commentated-on view to look around at what else is happening in the game at any time (pausing the commentary mash-up and starting up an extra renderer), and then, when they&#x27;re done, restart the commentary (terminating the renderer instance and resuming the parent session from where it was.) All the control of being a spectator for a physical sport; all the convenience of a DVR.<p>---<p>Mind you, with such a shift, you no longer get &quot;for free&quot; the compositing of the game session video-feed with other things going on on your PC, like voice/webcam recording. But it&#x27;s simple enough to create a &quot;mash-up&quot; site that plays a raw video-stream from a game-renderer service, and then syncs and overlays a much-more-diminutive 96kbps audio stream from the user&#x27;s own computer. Twitch would likely grow to serve that market that if the components were in place.<p>The important thing about this change, though, is that with remote async game-session rendering, you could actually stream games on a less-than-stellar internet connection (you&#x27;d still need low latency to play at all, but high bandwidth would no longer be a concern.) So many of my friends living in rural, under-served-by-ISPs areas wish they could stream, but can&#x27;t.",1445877489

Graham&#x27;s good at it after 25 years developing his writing <i>and</i> cultivating an audiance.<p>Everything else is secondary to this when it comes to getting people to read what I&#x27;ve written. The first writing I did that I thought was any good was on <i>Critique of Pure Reason</i> and I wrote that paper in the style of translated Kant, which is to say that there were a lot of &quot;which is to say that&quot; which is to say that &quot;which is to say that&quot; is not something I normally say in everyday conversation, but that I find very helpful when I&#x27;m trying to explain something complicated (and generalizes to a useful strategy at the end of meetings to help insure that everybody talked about some of the same things and hopefully it was the same things that were important).<p>And reading Kant shows that sometimes reading is hard work and that some people enjoy it, and bringing pleasure into the world by writing is possible. These days I sort of look to do that since why else would I write? Besides as a way of thinking, of course.<p>I guess that means that perhaps Matz is on to something, write what makes you happy. It sort of goes without saying that being nice is part of that and I&#x27;ve come to realize that the part of being an internet asshole that was pleasurable was the writing part and the part of that that was at the core of being happy was <i>writing effectively</i>.<p>Now for some kinds of writing, being effective means using short blunt sentences in the Hemmingway style. But fuck the man shot himself in the head, and Shakespeare and Faulkner didn&#x27;t. Not that it&#x27;s statistical proof that writing that way made him unhappy, but it obviously didn&#x27;t make him happy enough if it even made him happy at all.<p>Of course, I&#x27;m not PG, so people don&#x27;t expect the sage advice about startups; a good thing since his advice is really good. I&#x27;m just not sure his advice to beginning authors is particularly sage since the works from his early career as an author have the same &quot;clam ice cream with reluctance&quot; cleverness for the sake of being clever that impedes simplicity but gives authors the joy of playing with words that keeps them going forward like the nine iron over the tree from the deep rough that sticks close to the hole brings bad duffers back for more misery.<p>In other words, there&#x27;s something to be said for stream of consciousness writing and against being self conscious. Writing is a soliloquy, it&#x27;s a speech not a conversation: a sermon for the choir with only the hope that people won&#x27;t walk out as the level of attention that should be paid to the non-audience.<p>For what it&#x27;s worth, I had fun writing this, typos and all. I hope someone had fun reading it. I also enjoy Graham&#x27;s essays and books. I&#x27;d just simplify this one.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://norvig.com/Gettysburg/sld001.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://norvig.com/Gettysburg/sld001.htm</a>",1445877209

For all the talk of how expensive PC gaming is, for me it&#x27;s always been the <i>least</i> expensive way to play video games.  On the surface, a PC (of any stripe) will look more expensive than a game console at $500-1500 for a typical computer versus ~$400 for a game console.  But to me, a game console is an <i>additional</i> $400 that I&#x27;d be spending for another box just for playing games.<p>I think for a while, the growing popularity of laptops and fewer desktop sales might have affected this balance since notebooks were generally more expensive for equivalent hardware and often lacked the GPU power needed for even modest gaming.  But now I see even more modest laptops with integrated graphics that can handle at least some level of game performance as well as a crop of reasonably priced ($800-1000) notebooks that come with some sort of dedicated GPU.<p>I&#x27;m sure that for a lot of people whose computing usage can be handled solely with mobile-grade hardware (tablets, phones) the game console is a cheap and easy way to keep playing video games on a screen larger than 5 or 10 inches.  But for anyone who already needs a laptop or a desktop, the cost difference to add a bit more RAM and a decent video card is less than the cost of a game console and even the base level specs are getting to the point where you can expect at least a decent level of gaming capability.<p>I guess the tl;dr version is:  eSports help and more powerful phones/tablets may be cutting into the desktop/laptop markets but at the same time, desktops and laptops continue to improve and even mainstream PCs can handle games now (even better if you put an extra $150-250 into RAM and GPU).<p>As has historically been the case, the PC (whether a $600 Asus or a $2000 Macbook) is the gaming platform many people already own so it stands to reason that many will continue to use it as such.",1445877052

Meaning suppose the offspring is exposed to a totally different environment in contrast to the parent, will the offspring&#x27;s microRNA eventually change to match its changing environment, i.e., how does microRNA get expressed and regulated in the first place?<p>Thanks for posting this very interesting paper on Larmakianism making a comeback!",1445876731

When it does its usually for really out of whack errors like poisoned mutexes, crashed threads, etc (mind you, these are for unwrapping error values, not options, but it&#x27;s almost the same thing). Or for cases where it&#x27;s known to be valid due to invariants that can&#x27;t be expressed in the normal way.<p>I did a quick grep of hyper, and the unwraps are almost all in &quot;dev&quot; code (tests/benchmarks/etc). The cases where they aren&#x27;t are where there was an `is_some()` earlier (and due to some reasons it couldn&#x27;t be restructured as a match, perhaps just because of rightward drift), or the &quot;invariants&quot; thing -- i.e. it often calls `<some url>.serialize_path().unwrap()`, which is OK, because hyper only ever deals with relative schemes (e.g. `<a href=""http://`"" rel=""nofollow"">http://`</a> and `<a href=""https://`"" rel=""nofollow"">https://`</a>, not `data:` or `mailto:` -- the latter two don&#x27;t have paths), which is checked in the constructors, so this should NEVER panic. I didn&#x27;t go through all the code, but in the main HTTP and HTTP2 code serialize_path was the only offender, which was one that was justified.<p>I see it more often in applications. In the following cases:<p>- Example applications in blog posts (because you want to explain something else, not spend too much time on error handling)<p>- Slightly less out of whack errors which are weird enough that they should close the app<p>- Normal errors which should close the app (e.g. &quot;insufficient permissions&quot; for a command line util, or a port-opening error on a network app). unwrap() prints out the error message so this is a very rudimentary form of error handling anyway.<p>- Laziness, or often with a TODO. Not too common.<p>So, it&#x27;s mostly used in justifiable ways, and that&#x27;s why it exists in the stdlib. It doesn&#x27;t &quot;wipe out&quot; anything that the borrow checker provides (borrowchk and exhaustive match are two different things), and while it&#x27;s a kludge if used often there are legitimate reasons to use it; enough reasons to have it in the stdlib.<p>> I really don&#x27;t know a more eloquent method of handling these operations.<p><pre><code>    .filter_map(|x| foo(x))\n\n</code></pre>\n:)<p>(but yes, in general there are situations in which you <i>know</i> an Option is unwrappable, e.g. the serialize example above)",1445876710

That is:  A footnote is a link from the main text to the note.  The links (or the indications of the links) clutter up the main text, breaking the flow (or at least inviting you to do so).  For a normal text with a few footnotes, that&#x27;s probably the right approach.

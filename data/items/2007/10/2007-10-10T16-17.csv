65867,comment,65842,65842,0,0,drusenko,,,"One interesting thing to note (that wasn't mentioned in the article): The design is based on an SVG template that is modular & rasterized on the server to produce any color variation desired. We can also perform SVG layer-effects on raster images (Lighten, Darken, Screen, Multiply) -- which is how we get the patterns to match the background color, for example.<p>We'll be back-porting that feature to Weebly as well -- picture a web site template that is image-based yet still lets you choose any color combination desired.",1192034962
65866,comment,65408,65661,0,0,byrneseyeview,,,"I apologize if it didn't come off well. What I wanted to avoid was a response like ""That's racist!"" I should probably ask doctors how they do that -- do they say something like ""The racist disease, sickle-cell anemia, tends to strike people of African descent,"" or what?<p>I mean, the point of the article was that, given some data about tests, the correlation between tests and academic appointments, and some basic math, you can at least say ""If a group is under-represented in the sciences, it is mostly because their test scores are low."" Which means that either the test is inaccurate, and they're really underrepresented, or the test is accurate and they aren't. It's not about the research -- it's about showing where the prejudice has to be hiding if there's any prejudice to be found.",1192034702

65864,comment,65842,65842,0,0,zach,,,"Ah, bringing designing power to the people.  That's great.<p>What's with the shutdown speculation?  I can't imagine they'd shut it down given that it's not a competing content site and they're bringing out an API, would they?",1192034389
65863,comment,65668,65718,0,0,BrandonM,,,"I think people are complaining because xkcd is a high-quality site that everyone knows about (and likely reads already). In other words, just about every comic on the site could be submitted here, but most of us refrain from doing that.<p>Then again, the same thing could be said for PG's essays, but I guess in that case, there's always some kind of discussion to go along with them, whereas there's not much to say about a comic.",1192034377
65862,comment,65815,65815,0,0,jwinter,,,"> And yet whatever argument you use to prove that startups don't need to move from London to Silicon Valley could equally well be used to prove startups don't need to move from smaller towns to London.<p>Well, what if it isn't the raw number that makes a city a startup hub, but having a certain minimum amount of startups?  That argument would then account for small towns not being as startup-friendly as London, but London (or Boston or New York) being an equal to Silicon Valley.  Maybe the startup friendliness of a town looks more like a logarithmic graph than a linear one.

65858,comment,65815,65815,0,0,jedberg,,,"Paul, here is another point to backup your premise:  one of the best ways to meet potential investors/acquirers is to go to the same social events that they do.  If you live in the same place as them, even if you aren't going to a startup-oriented social event, you still have a good chance of running into them and striking up a conversation.<p>Case in point -- my cousin wants to make movies.  So he decided to move to LA and get a job as a bartender.  He went to bartending school and then got a job at a bar that is frequented by producers and other movie industry folk.  One day he served a drink to a producer, mentioned to the guy that he wanted to make movies, and is now working on a couple of movie deals.  That could have never happened even if he continued to live in his native Orange County, only 40 miles away.",1192034079
65857,comment,65855,65855,0,0,Tichy,,,"The problem with that kind of thing is polling the servers of Craigslist, I suppose. Would Craigslist allow it? Suppose you have thousands of items to poll for every day.",1192033963
65856,comment,65815,65815,0,0,cperciva,,,"""And just as Jews are ex officio allowed to tell Jewish jokes...""<p>I don't think ""ex officio"" is really appropriate here (although I'm sure we all knew what you meant), since being Jewish isn't strictly speaking an <i>office</i> which is held.  Perhaps <i>ex genesis</i> (""by right of birth"") or <i>ex sanguinis</i> (""by right of blood"") would be more appropriate?",1192033923

65854,comment,65566,65566,0,0,rwebb,,,"""At an average cost of $5 per click this adds up to maybe $500 per day in revenue for Google just for this one search. Multiply across 365 days and taking a very conservative guess that this happens across 10,000 different domains gives over $1.8 billion in yearly revenue for Google.""<p>clearly!",1192033635
65853,comment,65769,65790,0,0,cstejerean,,,"If the article is really valuable some other user would probably get around to submitting it sooner or later. on the other hand it would be nice to have a queue of articles you tried to submit and allow you to resubmit from that queue. some mechanisms would need to be put in place however to limit spammers (such as putting a limit on the size of the queue). but then someone else would come along complaining how the queue is not big enough....",1192033547

65851,comment,65081,65284,0,0,kashif,,,"I am not so certain. Smoked for almost 11 years before I quit in March of this year. <p>1. Smokers don't switch brands easily, its more than just choice or taste, bodies get used to a certain cigarette. I wouldn't' just buy your cigarettes because they contribute to a good cause. All cigs are not the same. If I wanted to contribute to cancer I have other ways of doing it. <p>2. Most smokers actually don't believe that they will get cancer from smoking. 'It can't happen to me' syndrome.<p>3.The population of smokers is getting younger. An ever larger chunk comes from teenagers and folks in their early 20's who do not want to spend more for cigarettes, additionally, what they smoke is also a function of what their friends smoke.<p>4. Cigarettes are getting increasingly expensive because of higher government taxes in most nations among other reasons.<p>5. No tobacco corporation publicly admits that tobacco causes cancer. No one will sell you tobacco to make these cigs,<p>6. Finally, the assumption that a majority of smokers don't like smoking is wrong. Most smokers enjoy smoking. Ask a smoker about his/her after dinner smoke and that should convince you.",1192033181

65847,comment,65815,65815,0,0,clem,,,"So how valuable is it to move to a strange city where you don't know anyone versus staying in the less optimal city where you actually have friends and connections?  It's great that Silicon Valley and Boston have this bubbling startup culture, but if you didn't graduate from school there it seems less likely you'd be able to tap into that resource.<p>",1192032572

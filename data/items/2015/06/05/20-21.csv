The question is whether this would be cheaper than doing a second pass over the message tree.  And also keep in mind that you would need the first pass to decode everything -- including UTF-8 data -- in reverse.  But since the UTF-8 APIs for Java strings probably don&#x27;t support this, you&#x27;d probably have to encode it, then reverse it to put it in the encoding buffer.  That way when it gets reversed again at the end, it would be proper UTF-8.<p>At the end of the day, this <i>probably</i> wouldn&#x27;t end up faster than what we do now.  But can&#x27;t say for sure without trying!",1433537941

I want to defend it not because it’s a particularly beautiful tower, but because of the idea it represents. Parisians panicked when they saw it, and when they abandoned the tower they also abandoned the idea of a high-density sustainable city. Because they exiled all future high rises to some far neighborhood like La Défense, they were segregating growth. Parisians reacted aesthetically, as they are wont to do, but they failed to consider the consequences of what it means to be a vital, living city versus a museum city. People sentimentalize their notions of the city, but with the carbon footprint, the waste of resources, our shrinking capacity, we have no choice but to build good high-rise buildings that are affordable. It’s not by coincidence that people are going to London now not just for work but for the available space. No young company can afford Paris.

I&#x27;m reminded of a quote from SMBC [1] that I&#x27;ve always liked:<p>&quot;Doubt kills more dreams than failure...but Random Chance is like, Grim Reaper for dreams.&quot;<p>Success in startups (and life in general) is not the linear function that most of us want it to be. It isn&#x27;t related in direct proportion to the amount of effort, intelligence, work, time, love, energy, etc that&#x27;s invested. It&#x27;s more of a logarithmic function. There is a minimum amount of effort and those other things that must be put in to have any chance of success. But after that the returns diminish rapidly. It&#x27;s comforting to think that if we just try harder or smarter we can triumph in the end. But the fickle winds of fate have the ultimate say, and any sense of control is probably an illusion.<p>Saying that a company failed due to lack of product-market fit is like saying that a sports team lost due to not scoring enough points. It&#x27;s always a true statement, but it doesn&#x27;t illuminate the cause of the failure in a way that would be instructive to others. Most startups that were successful enough to be included on this list probably did 80% of things &quot;right&quot;. Some times &quot;it just didn&#x27;t work out&quot; is all that you&#x27;ll be able to say.<p>Despite all that, I think there is a lot of value in these autopsies. Being able to learn something, anything, from the experience of others is very valuable. Knowing more about what causes failure won&#x27;t guarantee success, but it sure as hell beats knowing nothing.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.smbc-comics.com/?id=3506"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.smbc-comics.com/?id=3506</a>",1433537176

9668023,comment,9665152,9667745,0,0,donovanr,,,"A lot of the low-hanging fruit, in terms of statistical significance for heritable disease, has already been picked, in the sense of a naive search for SNP X in gene Y that causes disease Z.  The more people continue to look for single SNPs or even single gene causal factors, the more we learn that they are of limited use, due to the complexity and redundancy of biological interaction networks (genes/proteins/epigenetic modifications/environment/etc)<p>One thing that people are definitely still interested in regarding single genes or SNPS is looking for biomarkers.  For instance, it&#x27;s pretty easy to look at RNA abundance with RNA-seq and make a model with good discriminatory power to predict who does or doesn&#x27;t have (say) breast cancer.  But Those tests can be expensive, and profiling the appropriate tissue can be difficult.  On the other hand, if we could find SNPs that correlate well with the RNA expression model that predicts disease, then we could just do a cheaper test/faster/easier test for the SNPs.  Even better if we can validate causation independently using the emerging, though incomplete corpus of biological pathways.<p>Beyond that, some folks are excited about the field of functional genomics, which aims to correlate genome-level data to the structure and function of gene products (eg proteins) to get a more low-level, causal look at things.<p>Biological network extraction is something I&#x27;m excited about. Here, you usually want to extract pairs of features, or better yet, higher order structures from data to learn about what factors are important in disease pathways.  This puts you immediately in the regime of way more potential features than data points, even if you sequence everyone in the world.  I think this consideration worth thinking about when people try to hype you that big data and machine learning will just &quot;solve&quot; biology or medicine.  L1 regularization only gets you so far.  But it gets you somewhere, and can be hugely useful in suggesting new experiments.<p>I also think it&#x27;s important to think about how it may soon be cheaper to store actual RNA/DNA and sequence it on demand, than it will be to store the data itself.  DNA sequences would be a fine thing to sequence once and store, but for stuff, maybe not so much.",1433537051

It&#x27;s not life changing, but here&#x27;s what I think of it and why I use it:<p>- It&#x27;s quick and cheap. About $3 a meal, and I prepare a whole pouch at a time (just make sure to drink it all within 48 hours). Meal prep and clean-up time amortized across 3 meals is something like 20 seconds per meal. Even microwaves taquitos aren&#x27;t that fast.<p>- It&#x27;s almost guaranteed to be better for me than anything else that&#x27;s quick and cheap. I personally think it&#x27;s probably about as good as food science can get in terms of providing complete nutrition. There may some kind of micro-nutrients or some such that it may not be the best for. But considering the garbage I would normally eat on the run, I&#x27;m pretty sure I&#x27;m coming out on the positive side of things.<p>- I stay satiated on a solo cup full of it for about 2-3 hours longer than I do even with a gut splitting meal. I sometimes skip lunch entirely.<p>- When I get around to eating a regular meal, but appetite is about 50% of what it is normally. This is an amazing side-effect that&#x27;s zero effort on my part.<p>- I can mix it with other ingredients/foods have it as part of a meal or an entire meal.<p>- my blood sugar feels more evened out during the day, so I don&#x27;t go through sugar highs and sleepy lows as much<p>Downsides:<p>- a fully prepared container goes bad super fast, even in the fridge. I chalk this up to being full of nutrients, it&#x27;s kind of like the opposite of McDonald&#x27;s French Fries -- which will stay in good shape for months, even away from refrigeration.<p>- if I go above 50% Soylent for my meals, I get ultra-intense dreams -- often about eating meat. They aren&#x27;t nightmares, but they&#x27;re unpleasant.<p>- the satiation can sometimes feel a little like bloating<p>I&#x27;m considering also switching most of my lunches to it, but I also enjoy regular foodstuffs so much, and I actually do like the mid-day downtime during lunch.",1433536483

As a real-world example of its low requirements, I very recently setup an old Dell laptop running openSUSE 13.2 with Xfce; said laptop has a single-core processor and somewhere between 512 and 1024 megabytes of RAM (I forget the exact number).  Runs like a champ, while a &quot;modern&quot; version of Windows would - in my experience - choke even with much more resources at its disposal.  I&#x27;ve also run Xfce-based setups on even <i>weaker</i> hardware, though at that point you start to run more heavily into performance issues.<p>You can go even lighter than this, of course, by switching to a plain window manager instead of a full-fledged desktop environment.  Tiny Core Linux, for example, uses FLWM (a lightweight FLTK-based window manager); combined with its use of busybox instead of the GNU userland, it&#x27;s able to run on as little as an i486 and 42MB RAM.  That&#x27;s a bit on the extreme end, though, but going a bit bigger than that, I&#x27;ve had good experiences with Openbox (and similarly lightweight window managers) on a full GNU/Linux system running on systems with Pentium II processors and less than 256MB RAM.<p>Heavier desktop environments like GNOME, Unity, and KDE certainly have additional performance impacts, especially due to their heavy reliance on compositor effects.  However, in most circumstances, a system with 1-2GB RAM and a mid-200x single or dual core processor will handle these fine.  In the case of KDE, you can also turn off desktop effects, thus reducing computational overhead even further.<p>In the Windows world, you can generally get a system comfortably to the same realm by turning of Aero (in the case of Windows 7).  I&#x27;m not sure what the customization options are for Windows 8/8.1/10, but I expect the option for a &quot;Windows Classic&quot; look/feel still exists, and I further suspect that it would allow some additional usability.  However, in my experience, Windows is quite prone to slowing down over time; even with routine maintenance (defragging non-solid-state drives, running CCleaner, etc.), performance will typically degrade over several months to a year after installation.  For newer hardware, this isn&#x27;t a huge problem, but for older hardware, this becomes a significant obstacle to usability that GNU/Linux and BSD systems don&#x27;t typically have.",1433536359

The way the US does it in some cases, where earning 5K more in a given year can cost 10K in benefits, does creates a perverse incentive.  The way this charity does it, you get 1K and that&#x27;s it; it does not create perverse incentives.<p>Consider the following example.  In one example, a person receives X a week to help, but the aid rolls back when they get a job, M dollars less of aid for each dollar earned.  So a job comes along where they can earn Y dollars for 40 hours of work.  We could call M the means testing coefficient or something fancy like that.<p>Say that M is 1, and Y < X.  In this case, they will now spend 40 hours of their week for no immediate benefit.  Having a job may lead to possible longer term benefits (say beginning a career where eventually Y > X), but the cost of 40 hours of their life a week for such little possible benefit would make not working the better choice.<p>If X > Y, but only by a small amount, and M is 1, then they will see some small benefit, but spread over 40 hours it may still not make the job worth it.<p>And if M > 1 and Y < X, it would actually be harmful to get a job.<p>On the other hand, say that M was .25.  In this case, taking the job would almost always be beneficial, despite the relationship between X and Y.<p>As for this charity in question, M is 0 (but the aid lasts only for a year).  It is the least likely to cause any such harm to getting a job (except for when M is negative, which is to say the more you earn, the more aid you get, which oddly enough happens in some cases of corporate welfare).",1433535167

Finally, it would be really nice if the notes/todos could integrate with something like an issue tracker or project management tool.",1433534416

Later my job required .NET, so got into the MS stack but still kept playing around with Linux for things like IRC bots etc.<p>Then at work there was a major open source push, and we did a big project using Drupal. Used Eclipse and Netbeans(mostly this), deployed to Ubuntu server for dev and RHEL/CentOS for prod. I can sling Vim but never like Emacs(you need a second nose to type some of the shortcuts!)<p>I was DevOps because only I in the team had Linux experience beforehand. There were some good things but C# vs. PHP was no contest as was VS vs. Netbeans/Eclipse.<p>Ubuntu vs. CentOS/RHEL was quite annoying because there were small meaningless fragmentation differences like Apache daemon as httpd in one and apache2 in the other. Really? Why? I found myself raging at them sometimes.<p>After doing that for a year, back to VS and .NET and it felt like a relief. I liked the power of nginx though which we used as a reverse proxy for the Drupal project.",1433534414

Incidentally it also mimics Visual C++&#x27;s compiler from Microsoft in Visual Studio. I&#x27;d expect it to ship with an Xcode 5.1 alongside iOS 7.1. Now that I think about it, I should run to Apple&#x27;s developer site and see if that&#x27;s true. :)<p>Edit: Xcode 5.1 beta 4 ships with Apple LLVM version 5.1 (clang-503.0.9) (based on LLVM 3.4svn) according to Google searches. So I guess that&#x27;s a yes. I&#x27;m off to try it now. :)",1391032798

His impressions vary by a factor of 4 for the different ads. From that alone, I bet he forgot to turn of the &quot;optimize my ads&quot; setting from Google and switch on &quot;rotate evenly&quot;.<p>The &quot;optimize my ads&quot; feature sounds like a good thing to leave checked, but like most things is designed to make Google more money. That setting basically allows Google to start optimizing whichever ad gets out in front first - which doesn&#x27;t let you figure out which one is actually superior.

7147325,comment,7145636,7147124,11,0,mjn,,,"They explain it <i>really</i> weirdly, but it&#x27;s not that hard to cap your expenditure if you translate it into bandwidth units rather than storage units, since that&#x27;s what&#x27;s really being billed. The footnote on the main Pricing page is the most misleading part of their explanation:<p><i>If you choose to retrieve more than this amount of data in a month, you are charged a retrieval fee starting at $0.01 per gigabyte.</i><p>From this you might think the retrieval fee is some function of the gigabytes retrieved, but isn&#x27;t really in any direct way: you&#x27;re charged ((max gigabytes retrieved in any one hour in a month) x (720 hours in the month) x per-GB price), modulo some free quota. So you can really get charged up to &quot;720 gigabytes&quot; for a single gigabyte retrieved, which is a bit silly to think of in terms of per-gigabyte pricing.<p>It makes more sense to me if you think of it as priced by your peak retrieval bandwidth. Then you can cap your expenditure by just rate-throttling your retrieval. Make sure to throttle the actual requests, using HTTP range queries on very large files if necessary (many Glacier front-ends support this)... throttling just your network or router will not have the desired effect, since pricing doesn&#x27;t depend on download completion.<p>Anyway, the retrieval pricing in units of Mbps is ~$3/Mbps, billed at the peak hour-average retrieval rate for the month above the free quota. If you use that as a rule if thumb it&#x27;s not bad for personal use. For example given my pipe, it&#x27;s perfectly reasonable for me never to pull down more than 10 Mbps anyway, in which case my max retrieval costs are < $30/month.",1391032700

Yet, the people still want craft coffee.<p>This gave rise to lots of independents, but you never know what you&#x27;re getting from one independent to the next. Just because you&#x27;re an independent does not automatically make your coffee any good.<p>Blue Bottle has worked really hard to develop a reputation of really really caring about coffee, from farm to cup (and good ingredients in all food products). There are very few large independents who have a similar reputation (Stumptown comes to mind and Intelligentsia come to mind).<p>The last time I saw explosive growth in Coffee, which was cut way too short by a buyout from Starbucks for millions, was the Coffee Equipment company who manufactured the Clover machine. The Clover essentially elevated drip coffee to espresso status. The machine made drip coffee that tasted good, one cup at a time, and within 60 seconds. Blue Bottle isn&#x27;t manufacturing anything, so my opinion is that it&#x27;s going to be a long road to get to big growth.",1391032692

Nothing about political desires, entertainment desires, preferred styles of food, family structures (eg nuclear vs extended), so on and so forth.<p>If I like 3D movies, it doesn&#x27;t put me at odds with someone else who likes 3D movies. Or, for a stronger example, if I like secular law, it does put me at odds with someone who wants sharia law. This is not something that has an exhaustible quantity - it is a difference of culture, and is one less point of friction if we ameliorate it.<p>Perhaps a better example. If 9/11 was due to Irish terrorists, the US public would not have signed up in the order of hundreds of thousands to invade England and topple the English government. But this is what happened to Iraq. Iraq had done absolutely nothing, <i>nothing at all</i>, to the US public. Yet because it was in the same geographic region as the guys responsible, the US quite happily used Iraq as a proxy to flex their might. Hell, even if the 9/11 terrorists had been English, the US still wouldn&#x27;t have invaded England, unless it actually was an action of the English government. If they had been terrorists from any NATO country, that country would have been left alone.<p>The SF workers and the SF poor fit into the original commentor&#x27;s statement. They think very much alike, but there are still points of friction where they don&#x27;t. Nevertheless, they are not actually killing each other en masse - rock-throwing and protests. US and Arab cultures are not so much alike, but the US citizenry volunteers to go to the other side of the globe and kill Arabs that have not wronged them.<p>The more alike your cultures are, the more difficult it is to demonise the other, and the better you&#x27;ll get on.

Speculation was that one reason Google bought Motorola was to keep someone <i>else</i> from getting the patents and being able to use the patents against Google. If that was responsible for a large portion of the valuation, that might still be retained in a sale to Lenovo, depending on how precisely the sale is structured. It&#x27;s fairly common in patent sales to include terms protecting the seller, so Lenovo would likely not be able to turn around and sue Google with the just-purchased patents.

The factorial structure of the Internet Addiction Test (IAT) and the prevalence rates of it in a Greek sample will also be investigated. A total of 774 participants were recruited from a Technological Education Institute (mean age = 20.2, SD = 2.8) and from high school technical schools (mean age = 19.9, SD = 7.4). The IAT was used to measure the degree of problematic Internet use behaviors; the Parental Bonding Instrument was used to assess one&#x27;s recalled parenting experiences during the first 16 years of life; the shortened Person&#x27;s Relating to Others Questionnaire was used to assess one&#x27;s negative (i.e. maladaptive) relating to others (NRO). Both exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses confirmed the three-factor structure of the IAT. Only 1.0% of the sample was severely addicted to the Internet. The mediated effects of only the NRO and sadness were confirmed. Negative relating to others was found to fully mediate the effect of both the father&#x27;s optimal parenting and affectionless control on IA, whereas sadness was found to fully mediate the effect of the mother&#x27;s optimal parenting on IA. Overall, the results suggest that parenting style has an indirect impact on IA, through the mediating role of negative relating to others or sadness in later life. Both family-based and individual-based prevention and intervention efforts may reduce the incidence of IA.",1391031144

For a four hour visit, this averages ~$0.03/seat/hr in revenue.  These customers aren&#x27;t truly dining, they&#x27;re just congregating under the pretext of dining (by buying the minimal amount possible). _This_ is the type of behavior that would drive an individual store into implementing a 20-minute dining limit. Chances are it&#x27;s loosely enforced for actual dining customers, but provides the necessary pretext for booting these people when the lunch rush begins and actual dining customers need somewhere to dine. If customers come to eat and can&#x27;t find anywhere to sit, they&#x27;ll start going elsewhere for food and the store will see a noticeable decline in revenue.<p>While it sounds harsh, a restaurant is a business that makes money by selling food. The dining area is meant for dining. Systematically abusing it for congregating, <i>while providing marginally little revenue</i>, is going to result in limitations being erected to discourage such behavior. Coffee shops do the same thing with time limits on wifi, which is a limitation that works well to discourage their typical customer base.

I always thought that if you are running a split test in parallel (all at the same time), then you can figure out the number of samples needed to compare the branches with statistical confidence.  I mean it makes sense to me.  As the number of samples increases for each split test the distribution shifts from a binomial distribution to a gaussian distribution by the central limit theorem, and that happens around 1000 samples with a reasonable conversion rate.  Then you&#x27;re just comparing Gaussians, centered around the mean conversion value, with a width proportional to the number of samples.  Taking the difference between two gaussians will give you the &quot;chance to be different&quot;.  Standard practice is to wait until one branch has a 95% chance to be better and then declare it the winner.  This will test for false positives, which is usually what you are concerned about.

Western North Dakota, where the Bakken Shale oil boom is occurring, is very sparsely populated and historically had minimal infrastructure. It takes TIME to build pipelines to move the natural gas brought up by oil drilling operations to natural gas customers. Pipeline proposals are currently in regulatory review. There isn&#x27;t even pipeline infrastructure in place yet for all of the petroleum production in North Dakota--much of the oil produced there is brought to broader markets in tanker trucks, and the truck traffic volumes are putting a lot of stress on highway roadbeds until the highways can be upgraded.\nRight now there is a boom economy in western North Dakota, with extremely high wages, low unemployment, a shortage of single women,<p><a href=""http://www.twincities.com/national/ci_22382285/north-dakota-oil-boom-unsettles-gender-balance-some"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.twincities.com/national/ci_22382285/north-dakota-...</a><p>and established businesses in the region importing workers from as far away as Illinois just to keep up normal operations as workers quit to join oil field crews. There hasn&#x27;t been time to build infrastructure yet to move away the natural gas to markets that will pay for the gas--especially because the price of natural gas all over the United States has crashed because of the huge increase in production in the last few years. But given time, yes, there will be infrastructure in place to transport Bakken Shale gas to other markets, and I&#x27;m sure that we here in Minnesota will be as glad to have North Dakotan natural gas to supplement our nuclear-powered energy grid as we already are to have North Dakotan petroleum brought in by truck. Once more pipelines are built, the entire United States energy economy will become more flexible.<p>Still to be figured out is the economics of converting natural gas deliquefaction terminals (those cost BILLIONS of dollars and years to build or convert) along the Gulf Coast into liquefaction terminals, so that the United States can get into the business of exporting liquified natural gas. It could happen. North Africa and the Arabian Peninsula used to flare off all of their natural gas incidentally brought up during petroleum production--there was no local market for it. It took a long time to develop natural gas liquefaction; now there is international trade in natural gas that was undreamed of when I was growing up.",1391030096

In an attempt to save the team we pitched a new product, which actually had customer interest, to the CEO of the acquirer and he promised he would think about it and come back with an answer.<p>On the day when we got the call from the CEO to tell us whether our proposal was good or not rather than it being myself and our Director of Engineering on our side of the call we had all twelve in the room (although the guys on the other side of the call had no idea).<p>We were told it wasn&#x27;t going to happen, so everyone knew at that point what was going to happen next. I seem to remember something like laying most of the remaining people off, going to see the HR manager - finding out that my severance package wasn&#x27;t going to be what I thought it was and I could take a cheque there and then or fight it in court.<p>By that point I was so tired of the whole thing I took the cheque without a fight and moved on....<p>[NB I was involved in actually doing a substantial portion of the lay offs in each phase - after a while people really did <i>not</i> want to have 1 on 1 meetings with me].",1391029974

7146918,comment,7144934,7144934,7,0,wpietri,,,"Long ago when I was, I think, a sophomore in college and worked for the university IT group, I was trying to add an external drive to an early NeXT machine [1]. I wanted to try out their fancy GUI development stuff, you see. I was at best a modestly competent Unix admin, and this was circa NextStep 1.0, so the OS was... rough. It was in the dark days of SCSI terminators, so just telling if the drive was properly connected and, if so, how to address it was challenging.<p>After a couple hours of swearing, instead of working from a root shell in my own account, I just logged into the GUI as root. And there was a pretty interface showing the disks. I could just click on one and format it. Hooray!<p>Well either the GUI was buggy or I clicked on the wrong disk, because as the format was going, I realized the external drive wasn&#x27;t doing anything. I was formatting the internal boot hard drive. And since nobody but me gave a crap about this weird free box somebody had given them, they had repurposed it. As a file server. For the home directories of a bunch of my colleagues. Who were now collecting around me wondering what was going on. Oops.<p>No problem, says I. I&#x27;ll just restore from backups. But this thing used a weird magneto-optical drive [2]. The only boot media we had was on an MO disk. The backups were on another. And there was only one of these drives, probably only one in the whole state. The drives were, of course, incredibly slow, especially if you needed to swap disks. Which, I eventually discovered, I would have to do about a million times to have a hope of recovery.<p>Long story short, I spent 28 hours in a row in that chair. It was my immersion baptism [2] in the ways of being a sysadmin. The things I learned:<p>Fear the root shell. It should be treated with as much caution as a live snake.<p>Have backups. People will do dumb things; be ready.<p>A backup plan where you have never tried restoring anything may lead to more excitement than you want.<p>Be suspicious of GUI admin tools. Avoid <i>new</i> GUI admin tools if at all possible. Let somebody else be the one to discover the dangerous flaws.<p>If you were smart enough to break something, you&#x27;re smart enough to fix it. Don&#x27;t give up.<p>When some young idiot fucks up, check to make sure that they are sufficiently freaked out. If they are, no need to yell at them. Instead support them in solving the problem.<p>Seriously, my colleagues were awesome about this. I went on to become an actual paid sysadmin, and spent many years enjoying the work. The experience taught me fear, and a level of care that sticks with me today. I&#x27;m sure at the time I was wishing somebody would wave a magic wand and make it the problems go away, but working through it gave me a level of comfort in apparent disasters that has been helpful many times since.<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NeXTcube"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NeXTcube</a>\n[2] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magneto-optical_drive"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magneto-optical_drive</a>\n[3] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immersion_baptism"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Immersion_baptism</a>",1391029907

Which ones it then requests metadata (or full-contents) is up to it.<p>It&#x27;s true that for a ephemeral client (like a webapp) you don&#x27;t even want to get the whole list of 100K messages in your inbox (although you probably will ask the server for a count of them)  However, here having a sequential message number hardly helps either.  For example, when I click on &quot;sort by date&quot; in my mail client it shows me the messages by <i>sending</i> date, not by what integer IMAP UID they were given.<p>The problem of &quot;give me the metadata for the top 100 messages sorted by criteria X&quot; is just something that has to be offered by the server.  This is no different than features like searching -- if bandwidth were infinite the client could do it, but it&#x27;s not so you need to do the work near where the data is stored.<p>The server will have to maintain data structures to make these kinds of queries efficient.  The important point however, is that these are conceptually just caches of information that is in the mailstore.  Therefore there is no need to keep that synced between far-flung servers.<p>> The other thing to remember is that the metadata about the message is mutable, and needs to be kept in sync as well<p>Yes, message data and metadata are separate problems.  If two servers both try to update the metadata for message X at the same instant one needs to win (which one is probably not that important)  If two servers both try to add new messages to a folder at the same instant they <i>both</i> need to win, ideally without having to coordinate at all in advance.<p>For the metadata you can use a modseq, a Lamport timestamp, or probably even just a {wallclock time,server ID} tuple.  Assuming good time synchronization is reasonable for a mail cluster.  If two clients both try to change message flags within 10ms of each other it probably isn&#x27;t important who wins as long as somebody definitively does.",1391029501

But the reason is because I can&#x27;t afford it.  I&#x27;m in the same position as many others across the nation.<p>Under Obamacare, I am going to be fined some hundreds of dollars for not having health insurance; health insurance which, itself, costs at least $200/mo (even under Obamacare).

People simply have no money for $200/mo of extra costs.  People are also bad at long-term planning, so the impending threat of &quot;next year I&#x27;ll probably be fined&quot; isn&#x27;t going to persuade those who are bad at finances (the vast majority of Americans) to sign up for an immediate $200/mo expense.",1391029260

The following is my interpretation:<p>I think individual humans are often fearful about reality which is often outside of our control and goes against what we would prefer to happen.  This fear generally expresses itself as individual reserve, which means that even if there is a negative issue in our vicinity, we would rather accept its negative effects then proactively attempt to change it, even if changing the negative issue is within our capability.<p>I think the power of a true liberation teacher (Mandela, MLK Jr., Ghandi, Whitman, Tolstoy, Mohammad, Jesus, Mani, the gautama or whoever you might include in that list that is incomplete) is that they show us that we can travel beyond our fear to improve the world.  It&#x27;s not so much that Ghandi, for example, stood up to the British Empire all by himself, but that he showed his countrymen that they could stand up as well.<p>At a more personal level, consider the teachers and mentors who&#x27;ve helped you and pushed you forward beyond where you thought you could go.  They didn&#x27;t take your math test for you, but expanded your own ability to see success perhaps.  They didn&#x27;t give you that great creative idea, but they supported it or helped you refine it by probing its weaknesses.  In addition, we&#x27;re the product of all the people making incremental improvements and negative effects who have come before us, so no amazing success is the product of a complete vacuum.  It&#x27;s our duty as beneficiaries of that positive balance of improvements versus decrements to at least improve the environment for further improvements in the world&#x27;s situation despite costs to ourselves.<p>I dunno, that&#x27;s just my long-winded idea of how we may not be able to do some crazy ground-breaking accomplishment or develop a paradigm-shifting idea ourself, but we can lay the groundwork through our fellow man so that they might themselves.  Just a thought...",1427594376

There was a plethora of quirky, indie, and experimental games for Palm OS, here are some of the best I can remember:<p>- All games by Naoki Ito. This Japanese genius made simple arcade-style games, always with short levels of increasing difficulty, all of them perfectly balanced and extremely addictive.<p>- Space Trader. On the other end of the spectrum, a slow-paced trading and fighting game set in a generative world.<p>- Sigma. A weird little game with dice and a bell-shaped cumulative bar graph, unusual but once you got the hang of it, it was impossible to put down. I sort of recommend installing a Palm OS simulator/emulator just to try this one out.<p><i>Edit: Alright, here&#x27;s some more:</i><p>- Car. A bare-bones version of GTA I. The best part was that the level editor came with the (free) game and ran right there on your Palm.<p>- Space War. A turn-based strategy game where you move your (Star Trek inspired) ship on a hexagonal grid, and try to predict what your opponent will do during that turn.<p>- Aldon&#x27;s Crossing. A fairly classical top-down RPG. It seemed like a tiny game, but the more you played, the more you realized that the world was surprisingly huge.<p>And, of course, tons of remakes of ultra-classic games.

Atlanta doesn&#x27;t get a ton of snow or severe thunderstorms like the northeast or upper midwest, it isn&#x27;t in an overloaded air corridor like the northeast, and the airport&#x27;s runway and taxiway configuration allow multiple simultaneous takeoffs and landings with much more ease than someplace like O&#x27;Hare (which is basically beyond capacity at this point with its configuration).",1427592386

The former employees in Israel went to court, alleged the proper severance procedures had not been followed, and won, getting a pretty significant award from the court. But since TWA was no longer flying there (or anywhere), they had no way to collect on that judgment.<p>The remnants of TWA were acquired out of bankruptcy by AA, and allegedly Israeli courts have held that AA thus inherited TWA&#x27;s obligation to the former employees, but AA has not paid it off. Thus, the implicit threat is that any AA aircraft which lands in Israel is subject to seizure either as collateral or to simply be sold to pay the judgment.<p>At the moment US Airways flies PHL-TLV, but it remains to be seen whether that route will survive the final stages of their merger with AA.",1427590940

It&#x27;s hard to imagine a world where we build <i>and continue to improve</i> a source control / issue tracking system better than GitHub; a continuous integration solution better than Travis CI; a build system; etc.<p>Even if we can imagine building a better product today, the ongoing maintenance and extension of those services quickly become full-time multi-person investments with many hundreds of dedicated machines, neither of which even our core infra teams have, much less the little tiny research org.",1427590927

The C language doesn&#x27;t DISTINGUISH characters from their numerical representations. That&#x27;s where I say it&#x27;s weakly typed. It does not have an actual character type, it only has 8 bit numbers.<p>Of course in C it is perfectly logical. I am pointing out that it is not as strongly typed as other type systems that have richer types.",1427590861

Science is concerned with what&#x27;s testable/measurable, we&#x27;re not talking about anything testable/measurable.<p>I&#x27;ll try explaining the whole heaven/hell thing again. What does hell look like to you? Is it millions of former people being tortured for not living a virtuous life? If you go to hell, what part of you goes to hell? Do the former people in hell have bodies and faces? Do the former people keep their memories of their past life? Do the former people still think like the people they once were as humans?",1427590853

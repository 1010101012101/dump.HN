5866010,comment,5861964,5865638,2,0,mpyne,,,"Probably the most well-known example was the usage of the U.S. Army against the roving bandits led by Pancho Villa before WWI. This experience was actually formative in the experience of Gen. Pershing who later led U.S. troops in WWI, but that&#x27;s a different story.<p>Later in the century Congress has authorized the use of military force against Lebanese internal unrest that threatened to topple the government in 1958 (Operation Blue Bat).<p>Later use of force would be authorized in Lebanon again, with UN backing. Though to maintain the peace and not aggressive warfare per se, it did result in U.S. fatalities and other casualties, and the U.S. did fire live rounds.<p>&quot;Shay&#x27;s Rebellion&quot; (the Whiskey Rebellion) would also technically count I suppose, as President Washington <i>did</i> raise an army and march it to Pennsylvania, though the rebels dispersed without much bloodshed.<p>Also easily overlooked, but the U.S. often fought against pirates on the high seas, who are non-state actors by definition. Sometimes Congress made specific authorizations for them, sometimes not, but the U.S. did fight.<p>An interesting example is the &quot;Utah War&quot; where the Federal government and Mormon settlers feuded over land (of all things). Though no actual battles took place bases were attacked on both sides before the government won. The conflict itself extended over a year though, so it was not just some flash-in-the-pan.",1371002395

The introduction (and hopefully consistency) of multiple dimensions onto the phone, and a cross-system approach towards geometry, means that iOS7 will be a complete re-think of how applications work and behave on the iPhone.<p>And don&#x27;t be so quick to say, &quot;or even what Android and Windows phone offers..&quot; - Those are awesome platforms, and Apple can learn a lot from them (as Android and Windows have learned from the iPhone.)

How does it help <i>users</i> to all of a sudden have most apps feel ancient? Is it really something to be proud of? That for the next year we&#x27;ll be working on replacing existing utilities so that they feel &quot;right&quot; and &quot;fresh&quot; instead of doing what we should be doing: thinking of actual new software that is worthwhile to write.<p>I&#x27;ve been saying this for a while but I think what is happening, and what many developers haven&#x27;t noticed yet, is that we have exhausted the utility of software for software&#x27;s sake. The interesting stuff happening in mobile now has nothing to do with &quot;design&quot; in the traditional sense any more. Its not enough to just have a coder and a designer on the team. The really cool stuff is all about what your phone actually allows you to do in the real world. Look at apps like uber, postmates, spotify, and twitch.tv. Most of these have terrible UI&#x27;s, but that&#x27;s not the point. The point is that they allow you to <i>do things</i>. I can have a car on my doorstep! I can listen to almost any song I want. They&#x27;re not just another calculator app or news reader, so who cares if its not the prettiest or easiest thing to use in the world.  They are an interface to actually useful services. Software was interesting on its own a decade ago, but the industry has grown up, its time to <i>do things</i> now. That doesn&#x27;t mean that &quot;UI and UX&quot; don&#x27;t matter, it just means their definition changes and grows beyond just how you tap things on glass and what pixels you choose to animate.<p>The reason that iOS 7 seems comforting in the way its described in this article is because it gives developers who haven&#x27;t realized this something to do again. Marco is absolutely right, for a long time it has felt like all the major categories have been covered on the app store. That&#x27;s a good thing! It means we&#x27;ve solved lots of problems. We shouldn&#x27;t daydream of a day when those problems get artificially unsolved so we can have another shot at them. We should move on.",1371000426

These changes seem similar to the Android differences in gingerbread and post-honeycomb. The resulting effect on developers will be the same. iOS 7 has made it apparent which bloggers are unable or unwilling to be fair in their criticism when it comes to Apple. The mismatched gradients on the new icons are beautiful to them, the wire frame and confusing UI elements are revolutionary, and fragmentation is simply just creating fertile ground for change. Great.",1370999271

In the DP, there weren&#x27;t really too many navigational changes, and the UI was still instantly familiar. Yes, there are new APIs and other neat fancy rendering stuff, and you can&#x27;t discount the influence of the application&#x27;s look and feel, but... it didn&#x27;t feel very different, at least with regards to an experience perspective. It looks markedly better (apart from about 5-6 odd-looking icons on the home screen), and designing around that will perhaps be the most daunting challenge.<p>It will separate the best from the worst, however, and this beginning, this chance to start fresh, is what I look forward to.",1370999042

5865788,story,,,1,3,naquad,"Ask HN: Modern GUI VIM-like editor?",,"I very like VIM editor, its concept is just awesome and when you get used to it your efficiency becomes over 9^1000.
But VIM has issues:<p>1. Single threaded. Stuff like CtrlP or NeoComplCache are running in foreground and you can&#x27;t do anything until they finish.<p>2. Lacks API.<p>3. Very IMHO: vim-script is not an example of good design.<p>4. No real UI.<p>5. No embedded console.<p>6. Plugins don&#x27;t play nice with each other.<p>7. Speed.<p>8. Mixed modes.<p>Mr. Moolenar and thousands of commiters created a brilliant piece of software, just the problem is that it needs to adopt new features, its time to move on: real GUI, at least some general rework on vim-script, or even completely replacing it (bold), multithreading, centralized plugin repository, better error handling (read error reporting), etc...<p>One can of course say that VIM stays VIM even in 3013. But I have a hope that once VIM will adopt all those features.<p>Until then I&#x27;m looking for some alternative with support of modes, text objects, navigation...<p>What I&#x27;ve seen so far:<p>1. SublimeText2 &quot;vintage mode&quot;. Loud. Next fetish after TextMate. To be honest I wasn&#x27;t impressed that much + it costs money. Money that I wouldn&#x27;t pay for it. Very limited and inconvinient VIM mode. Not an option.<p>2. Editra. Slow. VIM with 60(!) plugins is faster than core Editra. Looks like Python2 + wxPython is not the fastest thing one can imagine.<p>3. Various Aptanta, NetBeans, Eclipse and etc... VIM-emulators. That requires lots of polishing. Also they&#x27;re slow. Sometimes even slower then Editra.<p>4. Gedit + ViGedit. Dead long time ago, but looked promising.<p>Do you know some other alternatives?<p>P.S.

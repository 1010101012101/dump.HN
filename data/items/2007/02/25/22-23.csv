1089,comment,1015,1015,0,0,mmcgrana,,,"From an engineering perspective, I enjoyed the inside look at how Myspace scaled their infrastructure.  Scaling is certainly a critical issue for these big sites; one of the reasons that Friendster waned in popularity was that they used algorithms and a back-end infrastructure that were painfully slow for their once-massive user base.  <p>On the other hand, a site should be able to handle several hundred thousand users with a single beefy database server, remote static file hosting, and a few load-balance webservers.  When you start &#39;scaling out&#39; to a bigger array of cheap hardware, you introduce complications that make your site harder to maintain and improve.  That change will need to happen at some point along the growth curve, but it seems to me that seed stage entrepreneurs need to be most concerned about making a product that people want to use.",1172443905

At the very least, maybe have down votes count as only 1/2 a vote. (So there would have to be greater than 2:1 of people against a story to bring it down below 0 points)",1172443382

I&#39;ve only done one such transaction but I understand this requirement is typical.<p>The company to be acquired also wants to have an NDA in this case since in the event that the acquisition does not proceed you don&#39;t want your negotiating position revealed to other potential acquirers before you have chance to even negotiate with them.\n",1172442120

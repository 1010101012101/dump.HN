6971075,comment,6942755,6944251,1,0,adamtj,,,"Amazon.com is perhaps a better example.  That site has multiple sign-in levels.  It&#x27;s not a binary state.  I&#x27;m not sure what names they use, but I&#x27;ll call them signed-in, signed-in-untrusted, and signed-out.<p>If you are fully signed-in, you can purchase something or make account changes.  If you are signed-in-untrusted, you can put things in the cart associated with your account, but you can&#x27;t purchase anything without typing a password.  If you are signed out, you are fully dissociated from any account.<p>Note that you can refactor that single trinary property into two binary properties: signed-in/signed-out and trusted/untrusted.  (Signed-out+trusted happens to be unused.)<p>Perhaps it&#x27;s obvious, but it&#x27;s true that every multi-state property (or set of properties) can be broken down into a set of binary properties like that, and the breakdown can be done in multiple ways.  The resulting binary properties may not be have sensible names as they do in my example, but it can be done.  In general, find all possible combinations of values for your set of many-state properties.  Enumerate those combinations and write the numbers in binary.  Each binary digit is a property in your new set of binary properties.  There are multiple possible enumerations, so there are multiple possible mappings from a set of many-state properties to a set of binary properties.<p>For example, if you have a three-state property and a four-state property, then you&#x27;ll a combination of 12 possible states.  Number those 12 states.  Write those numbers in binary.  You&#x27;ll need at least four binary digits.  That means you&#x27;ll have at minimum four binary properties.  Those four properties can have 16 total states, so four of the states will be unused.<p>You can similarly decompose your properties into a set of three-state properties by writing your enumeration in base-three.  I suppose you could also consider the current state of your program, with it&#x27;s many multi-state properties (integers have lots of possible states, strings have even more), to be a single variable-base number that enumerates a state in the state-space of your program.  If you consider the remaining input to your program to be part of your state, and the set of all possible outputs to be enumerated in a similar fashion, then the problem of programming is reduced to the building of a machine that maps numbers from one set to numbers in another.  How hard can that be?  So I&#x27;ll need your project done by Monday.",1388159840

My first experience using LaTex was to write a research report that ended up being about 15-20 pages and included figures, references, etc. I originally just wrote the report in emacs (without typesetting the math, figures, or references), and then it only took me maybe an extra 90 minutes to typeset the whole thing in LaTeX (previously not knowing any LaTeX). Also, using bibtex for my references saved me a huge amount of time, so the net time difference between writing with LaTeX or familiar tools for me was less than 90 minutes.<p>Overall, I would recommend using LaTeX because its really not too difficult to pick up.",1388159809

There&#x27;s no shortage of teachers at existing pay levels and teacher pay is consistent with the market pay for other college graduates of similar qualifications.<p>Thus, those who lobby for higher teacher pay argue that it will attract more qualified people to teaching. They point to countries like Finland, where it is common for teachers to have been in the top 10% of their college classes. They note that STEM majors, who make more than non-STEM majors, take a major pay cut to go into teaching.

Also, you couldn&#x27;t invoke any of the built-in objects and functions without them being global in some fashion.<p>This is just free vs. bound variables.

On the face of it Morsi was democratically elected but he also gave himself unlimited powers and was on his way to becoming just as much a tyrant as Mubarak ever was. He was deposed by a military coup which has its own problems and now Egypt is devolving into what seems to be an inevitable sectarian war (just as is happening in Syria, Lebanon, Iraq, and Pakistan/Afghanistan).<p>Calling the Egyptian army &quot;backed by the US government&quot; is a bit of a stretch. Prior to the coup the US shipped 12 F-16 fighters and millions in aid to Egypt under Morsi, since the coup the US has delayed further scheduled deliveries of F-16s and aid, largely as a protest for the harsh actions of the government against dissident groups. Nevertheless, there isn&#x27;t exactly a good side to back in Egypt at present. It&#x27;s not as though there&#x27;s a nice, peaceful secular organization dedicated to democracy and individual liberty just quietly growing in the shadows. Instead there are a bunch of folks who want to seize power to further their own interests.<p>Removing Qaddafi in Libya was almost certainly a good move though the followup there has been lacking. And the failure to engage in a meaningful way in the middle east in general has been frustrating. It&#x27;s a hard problem, but sitting back and fucking around when there&#x27;s serious shit going down isn&#x27;t really the best alternative. The middle east is going to be hugely different over the next decade, but how much influence the US will have over that shape (to guide it away from islamic fundamentalism and totalitarianism specifically) is very much in doubt at present.",1388158648
6970979,comment,6965492,6968834,1,0,graycat,,,"If the characters of the alphabet\nare larger on my screen, then the\nmaximum number of characters per line\nis lower which means that at a lot of\nWeb sites I can&#x27;t read a full line of text\nwithout horizontal scrolling.  In that \ncase, commonly I copy the text to the\nsystem clipboard, pull it into my\nfavorite text editor, &#x27;reflow&#x27; the lines,\nand then read them.  Bummer.<p>But a larger screen with each character\ntaking the same amount of area on the\nscreen as now would make the maximum \nnumber of characters per line larger\nletting me see whole lines more often\nwithout scrolling and/or let me\nhave each character take up more screen\narea without scrolling.<p>E.g., here at HN I&#x27;m seeing 90\ncharacters per line which is\nway too many.\nWhy HN wants such long lines I don&#x27;t \nknow.  What does HN want,\nscreens 10 feet wide?  Traditional\ntyping at 10 characters per inch\nhorizontally on 8 1/2 x 11&quot; paper\nwith 1&quot; margins gives maximum line\nlengths of 6 1/2&quot; or 65 characters\nper line.  Newspapers commonly had\nmany fewer characters per line.\n90 characters per line is just wacko\nin several respects -- there&#x27;s no\ngood reason for it.<p>On my Windows XP SP3 system (yes, I\nrecently got a DVD of Windows 7 Professional\n64 bit, for my next computer when I\nfinally give up on XP), it appears that\nnearly all the text from Microsoft&#x27;s\nprograms, e.g., essentially everything\nthat comes from the tree \nrooted at Start > Control Panel and\nStart > My Computer, was designed for\na screen with diagonal about my\n15.5&quot; but with 640 x 480 pixels.  \nUsing the Microsoft software to\nset the screen <i>resolution</i> down\nto 640 x 480 makes the old Microsoft\nsoftware much easier to read but, then,\ncommonly has too few characters per\nscreen to display all the screen\ncontents -- e.g., the screen from Start\ngives a message that some content could\nnot be displayed.  So, keeping my\npresent 1024 x 768 pixels per screen\nbut having a screen with diagonal\nlarger than 15.5&quot; should basically\njust <i>magnify</i> what is shown on the\nscreen, that is, each \ncharacter would\ntake up more screen area\nand be larger and easier to read.\nBut a screen with a diagonal larger\nthan 15.5&quot; and, say, 1280 x 960 pixels or \nsome, say, \n2048 x 1536 would, unless I got\na huge screen, say, diagonal\n31&quot;, make each character on the\nscreen take up less screen area\nand, thus, be still more difficult\nto read.<p>Yes, more pixels per character\nwould give nicer looking characters,\nbut characters with just 10 x 18 pixels are\neasy enough to read if they take up\nenough screen area.  That is, for reading\ntext, I don&#x27;t really need more pixels\nper character, as nice as that could be.<p>E.g., in my Web site development,\ncommonly I am specifying font\nsizes in terms of pixels, e.g.,<p><pre><code>     font-size:  25px;\n     line-height: 30px;\n</code></pre>\nThen, with such a Web page,\nmany more pixels per screen\nwould make each character take\nup less screen area and, thus,\nbe still more difficult to read.\nYes, when using a Web browser\nI can ask for it to magnify\nthe whole image and commonly do.\nBut other software need not\nhave such magnification, say,\nnearly all the software \nfrom Microsoft in the tree\nrooted at Start, so that more\npixels per screen could make the\ntext smaller and still more \ndifficult to read.<p>Net, I&#x27;d be happy with just\nmy present 1024 x 768 pixels\nbut displayed on a larger\nsheet of glass.  Or, a larger\nsheet of glass with, say, 4\ntimes as many pixels, could be\nmore difficult to read instead\nof easier.  Basically all I need\nis just a magnifying glass\nnone of my computer hard/software\nknows about.",1388158623

Virtually every application has external persistence of some kind and some way of referencing that persistence. Technically those references -- variables or classes that manage connection pools or IO utilities, etc. -- can be called &#x27;global state&#x27;, but that&#x27;s generally <i>not</i> what the CS literature is talking about when it says &#x27;avoid global state&#x27;. The Evil Global State of CS lore generally refers to globally accessible static or class-level values that refer to in-memory structs, objects or values of some kind, in the stack or heap, rather than external persistence. Filesystem and database access is usually taken for granted, and is ceded as the unavoidable level of &#x27;global state&#x27;:<p><a href=""http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?GlobalVariablesAreBad"" rel=""nofollow"">http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?GlobalVariablesAreBad</a><p>State, in general, at <i>any</i> scope, can make things difficult no doubt. But global state is classically bad because it&#x27;s hard to reason about across large chunks of distributed code, pollutes namespaces, creates concurrency nightmares, etc. Reducing the scope of state to a manageable range of, say, less than a dozen lines of code, into short-lived references, is clearly <i>far</i> better than the alternative and a reasonable approach in the vast majority of cases. Calling it &#x27;poison&#x27; ratchets the rhetoric way beyond the gravity of the problem. No, local state is not <i>considered harmful</i>.<p>What it seems OP is <i>really</i> talking about in practical terms is <i>pure stateless</i> programming, where the application has no implicit or explicit references to a value whose authoritative data resolves in <i>main memory</i>. If you were to tell me the only state you have in your application is Filesystem or database data, &quot;just beyond the edges of our program logic,&quot; I&#x27;d say you&#x27;d basically achieved the fabled &#x27;stateless&#x27; programming ideal, long held as a kind of Holy Grail of functional application development, and as OP points out, that&#x27;s not often achieved even in the strictest functional environments.<p>I don&#x27;t want to diminish the points made, the article was instructive to me as yet another anecdote about the perils of shared mutable state at any scope.

Tossing more money at <i>schools</i>, broken or functional, isn&#x27;t productive.<p>Half of all children in Chicago live in single-parent homes, and the poverty rate for families headed by a single mother are around 40%: <a href=""http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2013-11-03/news/ct-edit-xproject5a-family-1103-20131103_1_fathers-mothers-many-kids"" rel=""nofollow"">http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2013-11-03/news/ct-edit-x...</a>. That percentage is almost certainly much higher within the Chicago public school system, which skews poorer than the city as a whole.<p>You can&#x27;t have functional schools with students who have to worry more about gang violence in their neighborhood than their grades. More money, better curricula, better teachers, none of that matters when the social structure outside the school is crumbling.<p>I imagine much of the dysfunction endemic to urban school systems is related to the Sisyphean nature of the task we give them. We focus almost single-mindedly on schools and education to solve all the ills of urban society. If only our schools were functional and our teachers competent, we say, these kids would be able to rise out of their condition and better themselves. But teachers who teach in these systems realize the absurdity of that charge. Stuck between a student population that needs help in ways that are not within their power to give, and a society that fails to realize the actual needs of these young people, teachers shift to a mode focused on self-preservation. Hence the dysfunction present in urban school systems.",1388157829

For example,<p>1. Hack demand: What if a certain Bitcoin (or fraction thereof) were owned by a celebrity, I would think there would be greater demand for that specific bitcoin maybe even greater demand for the transaction should it be purchased direct from the celebrity versus additional degrees of separation from the original transaction.<p>2. Hack Supply:  Lets say I create a new startup, and instead of paper shares/stock I purchase 1 Bitcoin to be representative of the ownership of the company.  While that Bitcoin and its units would maintain its market value they would additionally contain the respective value of the company.<p>3.  There are also things that are currently being done that in my opinion decrease the value of certain bitcoins.  For example, buying bitcoin from an exchange that is not properly licensed/registered opens the door to the potential liability that a government may freeze accounts or confiscate any and all bitcoins that flowed through that exchange. Or for example, the 144,000 bitcoins that the FBI seized from Ulbricht, what if he sold those bitcoins to various buyers well below the market rate and next thing you know the FBI confiscates those bitcoins from the buyers and now the buyers are out their USD and bitcoin.

6970816,comment,6968425,6969862,4,0,mathattack,,,"I suspect your salary will triple theirs within 5 years.<p>My sense is there are a few reasons for this:<p>1)  It is very hard to measure the benefits of good teaching, and it tends to be on a much longer timeframe.  (Do we value nice teachers, or the ones that force us to learn?  And is there a good test for it?  I still get lessons from my great high school teachers, but it took a long time to appreciate some of them.)<p>2)  There is little competition for skills of high school teachers.  In large cities, there is one employer, take it or leave it.  Teachers get one salary - based on how long they&#x27;ve been there.  By the time they&#x27;re most beaten down and least effective, they&#x27;re paid the most.  Meanwhile, the academic literature suggests that after 5 years, there is little correlation between time in classroom and improved skills.<p>What can be done?  Improve the imperfect measurements, and open up the system for competition.  Make it easier for schools to compete for better teachers by paying them more.  (In the end, parents know which teachers are better)  Make it easier for parents to leave bad schools.  Make it easier to close schools whose parents leave.",1388156697

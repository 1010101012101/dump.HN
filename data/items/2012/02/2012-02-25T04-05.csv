It's always seemed to me that REST tutorials and evangelism ought to address this basic objection upfront, if they do have good counterarguments, but I've never seen them do so.<p>(A good HATEOS client would take the form of a graph navigator - this style of programming is one I associate more with ""AI"" than with typical web programming patterns. Which doesn't make it bad necessarily, but the REST material I've seen doesn't actually get into the navigational client programming side of things, which is the actual interesting part.)",1330145923

You have all the same problems in terms of solving a problem, finding a market, and getting traction but you have the additional problems of manufacturing, shipping and retail logistics.

Dropbox makes it a all just a little easier, just a little better with automatic backup, versioning and shell integration.<p>But it absolutely kills when it comes to collaborating with people who don't run a Linux server as a hobby. Publishing is easy, sharing is easier, overwritten or mistakenly deleted files are not a problem. It truly just works.<p>And it's <i>so much better</i> than other solutions. Do you know what many (many!) groups at my university use to share files, notes, previous tests, etc? A shared e-mail account -- an e-mail account to which everyone knows the password. With all the accompanying drama when someone misconfigures their e-mail client and deletes everything while downloading over pop3, or forgets to log out and then everyone can go through their search history.",1330143361

(Or alternatively: to not read the fine print on what licenses you can pick  and who does online, anyway?)<p>The one knock on Flickrs CC licensing I recall was a dust-up a few years ago where a CC-BY photo was later used in an advertising campaign unbeknownst to the person photographed or the person who originally posted the picture on Flickr: <a href=""https://www.nytimes.com/2007/10/01/technology/01link.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.nytimes.com/2007/10/01/technology/01link.html</a><p>FWIW, Flickrs default behavior at the moment (all rights reserved) is to protect photographers rights and prevent things like that from happening and its better IMO to err to that side of caution.",1330142970

4466319,comment,4464625,4465256,1,0,Jd,,,"Unfortunately, I'm not familiar enough with contemporary doping scandals to offer programmatic advice on what can be done about them, except to say that in my view here too we are probably at the cusp of major shift in a massive historical trend. This trend I suspect will end with 'doping' being considered the norm not only among athletes but among the general population, and the chemicals used will be seen as an generally accepted life enhancement rather than an aberration -- much like vitamin supplements already are. What to do about it today, when doping is illegal, at least within the context of professional sports competitions? I don't know, especially since in this context it seems that the trend is a scientific one, perhaps mixed with a degradation in values (here I'm simply not informed enough to comment).<p>You want to ""fix"" the problem? It probably depends on the gravity of the specific offense and the pervasiveness of the offense. Pushing a few people harshly and publicly can send a statement that certain things are not acceptable, and curb abuses by others who are watching them. This is not a particularly bad tactic, but again it is context specific.<p>My own approach is always to fit the solution to the problem in such a way that the optimal outcome (i.e. reduction of abuses in the short and long-term) is achieved.",1346565159

It's a free offering that's been improved with Google's deep pockets and infrastructure. Its gigantic existing 'back catalog' provides deep lock-in -- for both uploaders and fans of existing material/watchlists. Its video results even seem to be favored in Google search, and immune to the 'DMCA notification volume penalty' Google recently announced would be affecting other sites.<p>Any economist (like say the PhDs on Google's staff) could explain there are large returns to scale, lock-in effects, and cross-subsidization and product tie-ins affecting this market, and GooTube is way out in front. It doesn't reduce to a binary ""either there's a market... or not"" and it's absurd to claim ""Google's incumbent position doesn't come into it at all"". The existing offerings by incumbents with brand, scale, contractual agreements, Android integration,  and specific preferred models they're defending absolutely matter.<p>Let's call the hypothetical ad-free subscription kid service 'KidTube'. I'm not saying it'd necessarily be impossible to launch, just made a lot harder by YouTube's dominance.<p>The KidTube strategy would have to assume Google's resistance to easy migration of YouTube videos, for example via a bulk side-loading facility, even if the original uploaders wanted them reused. KidTube would also have to assume that if they got scale and traction, they would face a free competitor subsidized by Google's other revenues and product/promotional tie-ins. (For example, does your Google+ profile indicate you have children? Here's a targeted ad for our own kid service, the only one with all the videos your child already loves! All they have to do is create a juvenile Google+ profile! Please be sure to enter their real full name and birthdate.)",1346564224

Those of us who have a larger view of the system owe it to her to take her perspective seriously, and hopefully place it in the proper context that she is incapable of doing. The fact that she sees a division based on race is completely legitimate. The fact that she knows she's receiving a poor education from white teachers who don't give a shit is legitimate.

Even more, when you do realize something is wrong, a system utilizing exceptions is generally much better at propagating information about the original problem.",1346563594

So, nothing will change overnight, but this certainly isn't going to allow things to get _better_, which would eventually happen in a more free-market medical system.<p>Americans are exceptionally good at everything the free market touches (consider the tech world). Medicine could, and should, be a lot like going to the vet. Extreme competence, speed, and low price. The difference? There honestly isn't that much of a difference, except veterinary practice is pretty much a free market.<p>By the way, I've personally been forced to undergo unreasonably waits at the ER (I was kicked out of the building by a security guard because I wouldn't take a seat or stand - I couldn't physically do either, and I went and laid down in a parking lot outside). I've also seen a loved one hurt--potentially very severely over what could have been the case, but who knows--by not getting competent attention during a stroke. And there is at least one other bad story I won't get into here.<p>By the way, I do think my stories are representative of a larger trend. The above-mentioned incidents occured in different hospitals mixed between the east and west coast. That still isn't enough to prove anything. But I'm hearing complaints from a lot of people. Also, if you talk to someone applying to med school, you'll see that the number of doctors is being artificially restricted.<p>The public discussion about healthcare is missing a huge component, which is: why is our healthcare so completely shoddy and incompetent today?

The big difference is that in the SB you need to know where those places are (they're not always obvious) and you have to drive many exits to get from one place to another.<p>For example, if I want hole-in-the-wall Mexican cuisine and I want some Vietnamese dessert, I might be able to walk from one place to the next, in SF.  In SJ accomplishing the same would mean going from somewhere in north San Jose, to then somewhere on Senter road.  There's no way to walk it (ok, 2 hours).  If I want Cambodian it's another trek across the freeways.  So, yes, things are there in the SB, but you have to know where to find them and they can be very far from each other.  But, if you like ""discovery"" of hidden places, the SB has some interesting hidden in plain sight places.  They're hidden because most have a very targeted (ethnic) audience and few people outside that audience tend to know about those places, unless intro'd by someone who knows.<p>That is to say, the 'ethnic' aspects of SF actually have a diverse audience in mind, while in SJ, for example, most of the ethnic aspects are directed to a select audience and thus are less approachable by outsiders.

Twiddling a knob on a dresser is not a language, it's just an unusual curiosity.\nWe don't have electricity and cars and antibiotics because people had conversations with doorknobs and running water. We have them because people communicated abstract ideas to each other. That's language.<p>""And you find yourself thinking: She might have a point.""<p>Only if you don't know what the word language means. Otherwise you find yourself thinking ""that's stupid.""",1204173818

They actually make even the biggest Web 2.0 services like Flickr look small in comparison.<p>People will put up with bad interfaces and installing desktop software if it gets them what they want in a new, faster way. This has been proved several times since Napster arrived.<p>So why not make a better BitTorrent or something?<p>Oh, and I know Bram Cohen's company took money, and there are online services for transferring large files around, but as far as I know that's about it.",1204173578

Another fascinating surfer-physicist who is well on his way to delivering perfect surf waves on demand to bored teens at indoor land-locked malls.<p>""It's evening, and Black is hosting a dinner party with his girlfriend and a few guests at his house just blocks from ASR. As he throws a couple of fresh red snapper on the grill, Black talks about his quest to decipher the physics of surfing. It's one that's taken him more than 30 years, most of which had more to do with mundane coastal dynamics and oceanography than with surfing per se.""Before you can understand surfing reefs,"" he says, ""there's so much other knowledge you need. Wave dynamics. Sediment transport. Computer modeling. I was really in a long process to get those things before I could start on surf breaks.""<p><a href=""http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/12.05/surfing_pr.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/12.05/surfing_pr.html</a>",1204171584

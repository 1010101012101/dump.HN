452719,comment,451497,452269,0,0,Prrometheus,,,"From what I remember, there was nothing in the article about gay marriage, or the pledge of allegiance. The author wasn't even particularly religious, though he hinted at deist tendencies. He certainly wasn't advocating religion, rather he was discussing the role it played in the lives of its adherents, and what that meant for popular atheist advocacy.<p>But from the reaction on this thread, he could have been linking to a Jack Chick tract. The anti-intellectualism on display is stunning. It looks to me that a Pavlovian anti-religious response is kicking in and a bunch of folks are spewing worn out canned responses orthogonal to the topic at hand. The reason this topic was dead-ed is surely more due to the juvenile discussion here than the thought-provoking article.<p>Should we refuse to listen to Christmas carols over the holidays because California passed proposition 8? Ought we boycott history lectures that mention popes because of Catholic stances on birth control?<p>If we temporarily drop our feelings about how people ought to act and examine how people actually do act, I promise you that we will learn interesting things. What happened to the geek ideal of learning about the world around us?<p>What happened to the inquiring mind? When I meet people that think different from me, I try to understand what motivates them, why they are different, what their history is like, what their culture is like, and how they see me. That shouldn't be hard for smart people like you and me, and I think it's a valuable thing to do.<p>The downside is that when you start to understand people, you start to lose enemies, and it is fun to have enemies.<p>Sadly, there are few places where one can have a good conversation these days. Most of the people who are capable of interesting discussion are old. It seems few young people are learning the art of entertaining ideas without changing their minds. Such a flat society it will be when every conversation must be an occasion for advocacy or agreement.<p>But maybe I am missing your point and you are just going to restate how gay people are okay and evolution is correct again. How thrilling.",1233089751

According to Wikipedia, the ""action level"" of mercury in fish (the point at which government takes action) is one part per million.  So it sounds like you'd have to eat/drink thousands of servings of this food to equal one particularly bad helping of fish.<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercury_poisoning#Prevention"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercury_poisoning#Prevention</a><p>On the other hand, Wikipedia lists the legal limit for water as two parts per billion (""inorganic mercury"" instead of ""methylmercury""), which would be easier to hit.  I'm not sure which limit applies in this case.<p>Edit:  It might be worse than this for some portion of the population.  From the ""Not so sweet"" paper:<p><i>Using the USDA’s estimate of 50 grams of average consumption HFCS per day, one might roughly estimate potential total mercury ingestion via HFCS of up to 28.5ug total mercury/day (50 grams HFCS X 0.570 ug/g). Using these same assumptions, high-end HFCS consumers potentially could\nhave much higher total mercury ingestion.<p>It is difficult to know to what to compare this figure. The EPA has established a ""reference dose,"" or maximum recommended dietary intake of methylmercury. Methylmercury is the form typically found in fish and seafood. The reference dose of 0.1 ug/kg/day applies to women of childbearing age and young children, who are thought to be the most at risk from methylmercury exposure. For the ""average"" 55 kg American woman, this would translate into no more than 5.5ug/day of methylmercury.<p>There is no reference dose for total mercury. The mercury found in HFCS may be a different form of\nmercury than the methylmercury typically found in fish (we just don’t know), but it poses a risk just\nthe same. Mercury in any form can be toxic to the developing brain.</i>",1233088619

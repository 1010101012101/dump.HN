9294289,comment,9293026,9294028,0,0,gsnedders,,,"To be fair, until a few years ago the testsuites were mostly terrible and laughably bad — little more than skeletal things to ensure there was some basic interoperability (and not necessarily covering all the features of a spec). It took a huge push from a lot of people to get to where we are today; I remember pushing for the CSS 2.1 testsuite, which was one of the first to have a reasonable number of tests though it&#x27;s still far too shallow, to be largely automatable and getting a fair bit of resistance (because of fear of delaying the testsuite and the spec demonstrating interoperability of implementations and reaching REC), and that was in 2010 (though, holy cow, that&#x27;s almost five years ago now!).<p>As far as reference implementations go — I&#x27;m on the whole against them (you can end up having to implement bug-for-bug compatibility, which doesn&#x27;t help anyone and if those bugs fall out of implementation details they can lock you down into specific implementation designs). It&#x27;s better to have clear, unambiguous specs (preferably with next to nothing undefined) and multiple interoperable implementations — because it shows that the spec is clear enough for multiple people to implement it and come up with the same result. The machine readable route is a dangerous one — you don&#x27;t want to end up in a situation where everyone just uses the same implementation, because monocultures aren&#x27;t at all great.",1427774384

It’s incredibly difficult for developers to get their products into schools, and they have no information about the students who are using their software.  On the schools’ side, large districts are spending tons of money on learning applications, but they have no way of knowing if students are even using the apps they’re purchasing.  Teachers know there’s great software out there, but the challenge of getting 30 kids to log in correctly makes using it impossible.<p>At Clever, we’re working to change that.  We provide schools with a free API and single sign-on solution that makes using educational apps a breeze.  We’ve grown fast: after two and a half years, we’re moving data for a quarter of all K-12 students in America (15M kids), and 35,000 schools are using us to manage their education apps.  Our goals are much bigger than that, though.  We want to be two things:\n-a single place where schools can easily manage and analyze all the software they’re using, and\n-a single identity that students can use to see everything they’ve learned across multiple apps.<p>We’re a team of 50 (22 engineers) based in downtown San Francisco.  We’re looking for full-stack engineers who like:\n-Go, Coffeescript and Python (or are willing to learn)\n-big responsibilities (there are 700,000 students on the platform per engineer here)\n-hard technical problems (managing a huge, constantly updating data pipeline)\n-tech talks on everything ranging from the history of hip-hop to neuroscience to exoplanets<p>Check us out at <a href=""https://clever.com/about/jobs#engineer-full-stack"" rel=""nofollow"">https://clever.com/about/jobs#engineer-full-stack</a>, or check out what we’re working on at <a href=""https://github.com/clever"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/clever</a>.",1427773853

The inspection regime under those treaties has (as you and others say) failed with Iran.<p>If what you are saying is true, then the NPT has <i>failed</i>. Inspections are insufficient to provide oversight. Why and how have they failed? Are there any other countries which have circumvented those inspections under the NPT?<p>And as for &quot;rogue nuclear programs&quot;, I am not confident that there <i>is</i> a nuclear weapons program in Iran. The information I&#x27;ve read sounds like it&#x27;s the same quality of information that lead people to say that Iraq had a nuclear weapons program.<p>But even so, let&#x27;s look at other &quot;rogue programs&quot; and see if they have gone cancerous. (Mind you, some cancers are benign, so your analogy isn&#x27;t that good to start with.)  Apartheid-era South Africa developed its nuclear technology in secret. We didn&#x27;t bomb them. They dismantled their program, and became signatories of the NPT.<p>Israel is suspected to have nuclear weapons, and is certainly capable of developing them. It has an official policy of being ambiguous. It&#x27;s believed they contributed weapons development information to South Africa. Do you call that program a &quot;cancer&quot; that needs to be excised? BTW, Israel is not a party to the NPT.<p>NBC reported that Israel funded the M.E.K - designated a terrorist group by the United States - to assassinate Iranian nuclear scientists. <a href=""http://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2012/02/israel-and-proxy-terrorism/252971/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2012/02/isr...</a> .

We prefer to bomb or invade those countries that <i>don&#x27;t</i> have their knife on someone &#x27;s throat.

If not, what does Iran need to do to have a non-rogue nuclear program, in the same way that Pakistan does not have a &#x27;rogue nuclear program&#x27; that justifies bombing?<p>&quot;Iran&#x27;s terrorist activities&quot; is besides the point. The question is if they have a nuclear weapons program.<p>Famously, chemical weapons weren&#x27;t used in WWII, but heavily used in WWI.

I sincerely doubt Microsoft would comply with a smile, and even after they won the (secret) court case keeping the operation under wraps would be even more laborious. Snowden is proof that people who sign contracts are still capable of disclosing secrets.<p>It is worth it for the NSA to backdoor crypto because, if the implementation is solid and the keys can&#x27;t be stolen, then no matter how many resources they pour into cracking it the math will remain inflexible.<p>There is no computer in the world with that kind of security. If it is smartly configured, they&#x27;ll use 0day. If its airgapped, they&#x27;ll compromise a sysadmin&#x27;s computer and wait for them to connect to it (think Stuxnet.) If that isn&#x27;t feasible, they&#x27;ll walk into the data center and put malicious hardware into a PCI slot.<p>If we persist in thinking of the NSA as a boogeyman logging every packet and backdooring every OS, rather than discussing their real capabilities and motivations - what they are, what they should be - we will become paralyzed to act against them, they will continue to operate without meaningful oversight, and our rights to privacy and to secure software will languish.",1427772575

Instead, you become the &quot;troll,&quot; or the &quot;problem,&quot; and quietly become isolated from large areas of the network, all while reducing the amount of information you have to sift through before passing it along to the populace, in the name of security.<p>And while the effect on actual traffic may be minimal, it does make for a very cold perception which generally makes cross-cultural integration unlikely.  How many western consumer-technology companies do you see integrating with Asia-based API&#x27;s/demand, compared to other industry, let alone academics?",1427771796

It&#x27;s been about 4 months now and it has had an effect on all aspects of my life.<p>I found recently that instead of doing work while commuting, I was better off reading books of my choosing and listening to music. I look forward to that part of my day. I also started doing more exercise and have found that to have an impact as well.<p>That&#x27;s the path I am taking.",1427771003

Visual distractions: people walking through, people seemingly approaching me (but actually approaching someone nearby), people waving, etc. are all just as bad as auditory distractions, if not worse for me personally since I tend to rely heavily on vision to replace what I can&#x27;t hear.",1427770955

If the bank can&#x27;t reinvest above zero, there&#x27;s no value in running a branch network to collect deposits or running a payments system in exchange for some float. the whole system is on life support because the Fed provided a bank subsidy via interest on excess reserves. but the whole system, things like money market funds, CDs, they make no sense in a negative interest rate environment.<p>how about all those people with 30-year, 80% loan to value mortgages? the value of the house goes down year after year, the real value of the mortgage and the fixed mortgage payment goes up, they&#x27;re going to have a pretty bad time.<p>how about all the (much reduced) companies and municipalities that have defined benefit pensions, or even life insurance contracts that assume a positive, relatively risk-free return? all those pension funds and insurance companies go bust.<p>how are people going to feel about periodic reductions in their wages? people have a hard time with it, and wages and prices tend to be stickier going down than going up. constant downward pressure makes people unhappy and is hard to get used to, even if relative prices stay the same.<p>the expectation that prices are not going to consistently go down over time is pretty hard-coded into the financial system and contracts and people&#x27;s psychology, and if it happened it would cause more disruption than higher-than-expected inflation.",1427770801

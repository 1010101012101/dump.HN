I haven't really had problems with this, but I've also never considered it.  <p>There is probably a balance between font size and ease of scrolling around that would be optimal.",1191959241

Now I know how little I can sleep and still function.<p>I think one thing I've learned though more than anything is that startups take a long time and its better to work from 8-10 7 days a week for 2 years than to work 6-12 everyday for a few months.<p>So I average about 6 hours a sleep a night now, and make sure to exercise everyday.",1191957645
65410,comment,64650,64650,0,0,davy,,,"IQ and SAT might provide benchmarks for intelligence, but they have no correlation with the desire and ability to complete a large task. Everyone knows that smart kid in high school/college who sat around playing WOW and drinking Mt Dew all day.  Y Combinator does not want him.<p>In addition, sometimes the not-as-smart kid who has a good idea and a lot of motivation can accomplish something great.<p>If you did not spend months working on something, possibly crying at times with frustration and jumping around euphorically when you hit a new milestone, you have not done something with a high level of ability.",1191957531
65409,comment,64431,64610,0,0,nostrademons,,,"Probably means you're missing some critical usability feature, i.e. you're not solving the whole problem.  Few ideas are all bad or all good, and things rarely tip all by themselves.  But people don't use a product unless it solves their whole problem without making them hunt for missing pieces - that's really the difference between ""project"" and ""product"".  If you're missing a piece, it'll never get off the ground.<p>The missing pieces are usually pretty subtle too - FaceBook took off largely because it was explicitly designed around existing physical social networks, like colleges.  Many other people had done similar sites years earlier, but they always focused on building a social network out of thin ether, rather than leveraging offline social contacts.",1191957376

A bunch of 26 year olds will definitely have a crisis of credibility -- even with a functional product (which is the case with us). To a very large extent, a group like YC will give us the kind of credibility we need to approach the Indian angel/VC community. Not to mention the fact that the Indian press will love it :)",1191957023

For example, when you have basketball player selling you a Gilette razor, it makes absolutely no sense to me, same as Tiger Woods selling me a buick. That's wack.

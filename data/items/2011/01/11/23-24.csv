It felt like a pure kids movie + merchandising extravaganza.<p>> and box office receipts prove my point too<p>This isn't saying much. The cost-structure of CGI and effects-heavy films is such that you have to essentially make something that will appeal to kids and/or teens, otherwise you're hosed financially.<p>I can think of many great stories that I'd love to see on screen that wouldn't really appeal to kids + teens, and therefore wouldn't be feasible with the current cost-structure.",1294790390

The 'tag' is automatically created based on the words in the paragraph, via Javascript, and decoded appropriately.<p>It is also slightly neat in that you can highlight a specific sentence (multiple sentences actually, see the little tutorial at the bottom).<p>I actually kind of like it, it would be a neat way to really highlight what you think is interesting in an article when sending someone a link.  But doing it as a per site thing is crazy.. seems like it could be a good browser extension though.  People who have it installed would instantly get a more functional linking experience.  Imagine linking off to some documentation in a blog post for a coding problem, say to a Django documentation page, and when someone clicks the link they are not only taken to the specific part of the page that you are talking about, but the relevant stuff is actually highlighted.  That'd be Neat (tm).",1294790347

If that is bad or no that's depend on how do you see Apple and Google, if you believe this post contain a good message or if you believe Gruber but not both, for me both are just false in their pretense of openness, which is why I supported Theora in the first place.<p>Theora vs. H.264 was the first big fight that I remember in HN were the majority of comments were just bullshit for me (just like this thread), although there were really good ones from both sides, I also commented in the matter, back then I said that codecs would grow in irrelevance, I belive that H.264, as a patent covered standard, will lose in the future because its licensing terms are not clear and a license for its use can be pretty expensive to people trying to win some money from web video, specially those that have no money initially to spend in royalties (like startups, open source and non commercial projects), my example back them was a cloudy video editor, maybe something that is impractical today, but that I do expect becoming at least practical for simple uses in 2 to 3 years from now.<p>For this type of user paying for royalties in the beginning just does not make any sense and is stressful for their financial situation, this if they want to win money with their project, it's even more complicated for open source projects, for the case that people want to win some money from their company or project a good comparison would be the college student that take loans, trying to make some potential money in the future while spending money that he does not have in the present.<p>I think that WebM will have the preference of this public if they are not aiming Apple products. For me this will happen just because MPEG LA was incompetent enough and did not knew how to deal with the situation, opening the standard to small business, not charging users and business that only stream the using codec, things like that that the consortium never clarified (they never defined the ""broadcast market"" from which they plan to charge royalties from).<p>More could be said about why I think H.264 will be a thing of the past in the following years, but them my comment would be too big.",1294788492

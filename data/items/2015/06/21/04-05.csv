You only scan (roughly) those old objects who hold references that have been mutated since the last collection.<p>>This is also possible when mutation is allowed (see Red Hat&#x27;s Shenandoah[1][2], A new GC for HotSpot), and immutability doesn&#x27;t make the challenge significantly easier (there is added overhead for mutation only).<p>You pay for this with barriers and implementation complexity.<p>>To summarize, current (and future) HotSpot GCs punish you for mutation, but not for the possibility of mutation; you get all the benefits of immutability automatically when you simply don&#x27;t mutate references. Immutability -- as you note -- might indeed simplify the GC (though not in the case of Clojure, which does allow quite a lot of mutability -- not everywhere, but enough that you have to account for it not as an outlier), but it doesn&#x27;t make it faster.<p>>A good JIT (like HotSpot) does this a lot better. It is true that Clojure is nowhere near as crazily-dispatched as, say Ruby, but it does rely a lot on Java-like interface-based dynamic dispatch. If your type inference is really, really good, you might be able to identify a great deal of the monomorphic call-sites, but a good JIT finds all of them and makes those calls virtually free, something an AOT compiler can never hope to achieve. Besides, HotSpot&#x27;s optimizing JIT is a state-of-the-art compiler. You won&#x27;t do any better with LLVM.<p>Rust code doesn&#x27;t pay for write barriers at all - my point isn&#x27;t that Clojure on Rust would be faster than Clojure on JVM, it&#x27;s that Rust code allows much more deterministic performance, better tools for manual optimizations and native interop than JVM and you&#x27;d write the performance sensitive code in Rust. Clojure is then a high level tool to consume Rust code.<p>I think you&#x27;re looking at this the wrong way and missing the obvious benefits - you would get a simple <i>almost</i> pauseless parallel GC and a high level language with trivial native/safe rust interop (which JNI isn&#x27;t).<p>Because of Rust type system you could even isolate threads that have no access to the shared heap and not collect/pause on those - so no chance at pauses at all. And AoT compilation also gives you deterministic performance.<p>Anyway it would be a lot of work for sure, I doubt it would be a straight port of clojure (would need to make it more static to fit to AOT nicely) and you would have to modify Rust to generate metadata so that the dynamics parts could run (or just ditch the dynamic part completely and force everything to be resolved at compile time with a simplified/constrained type system that would be simpler to infer without explicit typing).",1434862627

From what I can tell, they use a variable called `on` to control where every set of commands write their results too. They do some funky `mov` stuff to do a comparison, and then set `on` with that comparison. They use a stack of `on` variables and then pop off the value of `on` from that stack when you exit a loop.<p>They cheat to get a jump without using anything but `mov`&#x27;s by executing an illegal set of `cs` using `mov`, and then use the sigill generated to execute a signal handler, which is just the same spot that the code starts at. IMO, it doesn&#x27;t really count, so a `mov`-only program requires at least one jmp instruction to work.<p>I think loops are achieved by simply running the code to the end without saving any of the results, and then hitting the singal and going back to the beginning - ignoring all the code until you hit the loop you&#x27;re executing.

The use-case I have in mind is an in-memory database because a. that is a significant part of what I do and am most familiar with and b. because in the age of large RAM, its most effective use is embedding large parts of the database within the application process (whether as an actual product, or replicating some part of a database&#x27;s functionality ad-hoc). While doing so in an environment without a GC is certainly possible, it is both much harder and/or (depending on the effort spent) less scalable with increasing numbers of cores. I have come to that conclusion after spending many years trying doing that in C++.<p>2. I have no doubt that Rust -- and I take great joy in this fact -- makes a whole lot of things much easier than C++. But there is also no question that Rust is harder to program than most GCed languages. The question from my perspective, then, is not &quot;why not do it in Rust?&quot; but &quot;why not in Java?&quot;. There is a good answer to that question: Rust is much more suitable than Java (in terms of performance and RAM footprint) when running in constrained environments. But unless you&#x27;re targeting a constrained environment, why work even a little harder at all?<p>More generally, I believe that the most efficient form of memory management in <i>unconstrained environments</i>, in terms of both throughput and worst-case latency -- and I&#x27;ve had this discussion on HN with pcwalton -- is an environment that allows three types of memory: stack, scoped arenas (including a permanent scope), and a GCed heap. Real-time Java (RTSJ) provides exactly that. Combining arenas with Rust&#x27;s beautiful scoped threads is a great idea.

But, that&#x27;s because this only compiles BF (It is basically a POC after-all), and thus you have to use that as an intermediate language. BF is extremely un-optimal, and the compiler here spits out a completely unoptimized one-to-one conversion of the BF source to assembly that uses only `mov` instructions. Thus, the size of the assembly will balloon extremely quickly simply because it takes a lot of BF to express fairly simple things. Branching using only `mov` is also impossible, so the code instead uses a flag to control where the assembly writes it&#x27;s results. Because of this, even when you hit the condition of a loop, if your condition check is before the loop&#x27;s code, then it results in you running the entire loop&#x27;s code another time, and just throwing out the results. It&#x27;s extremely wasteful.<p>Based on this POC alone, it&#x27;s pretty much impossible to guess how much slower a real `mov` only compiler would be vs. a regular compiler.

A language that chooses to reduce bugs by placing non-trivial constraints on the developer -- i.e. by increasing the mental burden -- would do well to concentrate efforts on those bugs that cost more. IMO, Haskell does the exact opposite, nearly eliminating data-transformation bugs -- that are very easily found -- and doing little (though not nothing) to reduce effect-related bugs.<p>Pure functional programming carries other burdens, too, some stemming from its conceptual roots in lambda calculus, like the lack of a clear complexity model.<p>I also reject the conclusion that if most costly bugs are related to effects, our best course of action is getting rid of them altogether (or relegating them to an opaque runtime). This solution seems strange, as side-effects -- in spite of their name -- are the most central component of useful programs. <i>Effects are the things we program</i> (unless we&#x27;re writing a compiler). This solution seems to me like suggesting to a programmer that since typing is the cause of wrist pain, she should type with her tongue. There are better solutions already. Clojure&#x27;s approach to memory effects is at least as effective as Haskell&#x27;s in preventing certain types of bugs, yet the language places a much lower mental burden on the programmer.<p>Lastly, I think PFP has (unintentionally) caused many to believe it is the only approach to a more &quot;mathematical&quot; mode of programming, and the best course for formal software verification. Neither could be farther from the truth. Haskell could not have prevented the bug discovered in Java&#x27;s (originally Python&#x27;s) efficient sorting algorithms -- probably the most used sorting code in the world today -- a few months ago, and it would have been very hard to detect it even in Idris (if the algorithm is expressible at all in that language). Instead, it was discovered with a software verifier for imperative languages. It is true that PFP languages may depend in clever ways on the Curry-Howard correspondence to help (force?) the programmer to prove some properties of her algorithm, but spelling out a partial proof in the code itself is not the only -- or even the best -- way to verify a program.<p>All this is not to say that we haven&#x27;t learned a great deal from PFP and its approach to software verification.

9752115,comment,9751539,9751539,0,0,e1g,,,"For me, the most significant benefit of using React is the community around it. Rightly or wrongly, React had been crowned as the darling of &quot;modern front end&quot; and that has attracted huge amounts of criticism, debates, and exploration into how we build complex UIs. Over the last year the cumulative output of those people plus the related projects such as Babel and Webpack have collectively taught me a smarter way of developing complex dynamic interfaces for the web. The highest praise I can offer is that for the first time in 15 years I feel like I can bring the same level of engineering to the frontend that has been available to us the backend - code that is predictable, reliable, testable, maintainable, and understandable by others.<p>Having said that, such frantic activity is a double-edged sword. React universe is a rapidly shifting beast - a particular tactic can be the recommended way today, then quickly superseded and discouraged by tomorrow. Some examples include: React&#x27;s initial createClass() guidance, react-router&#x27;s &quot;final, final2, final3&quot; API surface, react-dnd&#x27;s complete and incompatible rewrite between 0.9.8 and 1.0, the many phases of the flux store evolution (from &#x27;just arrays of data&#x27;, to &#x27;maybe ajax reads&#x27;, to &#x27;not data at all&#x27;) etc. In every such case I get annoyed at first, then shortly after I become grateful for the change because the new way _is_ significantly better and it _does_ lead to my app code being appreciably better in structure/flexibility/agility etc. This is great for continuously evolving products - our quality increases with each such iteration. But this can be difficult to budget for, or I do not enjoy going back to the rest of the team with the news that what I asked them to do before should now be avoided. We all learn and our core product benefits, but these quality and engineering efforts are a cost that not every team can maintain indefinitely.<p>Lastly, React is relatively unopinionated itself which means everyone has a different way to consume it. The freedom is there, and I see many teams using it to shoot themselves in the foot. Take the concept of Flux for example - for clean and maintainable code, very few components should ever have the word &#x27;flux&#x27; or &#x27;action&#x27; or &#x27;store&#x27; in them. The overwhelming majority (>80%) of components should be ridiculously stupid, have no state, and certainly know nothing of flux. But the temptation is there - &quot;oh I&#x27;ll just drop flux inside and boom I have this power to do anything I want from my ProductSummary component&quot;). This leads to the project having way too many moving parts, overpowered components acting at will, unauthorised data access points which cause subtle bugs, and the project ends up being the same unpredictable mess as we&#x27;d&#x27; have with jQuery. Yes, the rendering is done with React, but that&#x27;s a hollow gain if the app is still unwieldy.<p>Using React demands discipline and focus to have hard boundaries between components, creating clear and predictable data/action flows, removing as much state as possible, and obsessively guarding and layering app&#x27;s building blocks. Incidentally, if you do it the &#x27;right&#x27; way, React itself will be the most inconsequential part of the system that you can swipe away with ease when a better way to write reliable interface will be inevitably discovered.",1434859567

Sure, there&#x27;s a lot of appeals to egotism or pure numbers as well, but also to all sorts of fuzzy things that apparently do matter enough to enough people that even the most depraved <i>have</i> to pay at least lip service to them.<p>> It&#x27;s like evolution -- the winners keep winning and the losers drop out. Eventually people adopt the winning strategies.<p>I&#x27;m thinking it&#x27;s also a bit like narcissism and other personality disorders; abuse leads to more abuse. And it becomes a cycle: in a constant state of warfare of all against all, becoming more ruthless is indeed &quot;winning&quot; -- but from another perspective, it might be getting stuck in a very low local optimum. My point being that we have a basically infititely big universe around us, that is infinitely hostile to life and also infinitely loaded with resources and adventures -- an infinite enemy to compete with, if you will, instead of severely crippling our ability as a &quot;team&quot; (and I don&#x27;t just mean humans) to do so by sniping each other.<p>Imagine a PvE game with friendly fire turned on -- if a bunch of people decided that it&#x27;s a Free-For-All deathmatch game and start ganging up and spawn killing, then that&#x27;s what it&#x27;ll effectively be. Even in an infinite world, they&#x27;d never get far from spawn, or discover the more interesting and refined game mechanics. And then the free beta ends, the servers get shut down -- &quot;thanks for playing, I hope you made the best of it&quot; -- the people who had the biggest pile of loot and skulls in this Lord of the Flies scenario would <i>still</i> think they &quot;won&quot;. Yeah, they were vastly richer than most others, but compared to what they missed out on, they are infinitely poor.<p>While I&#x27;m rambling, I would say evolution would not stop even in the most utopian of hippie societies, simply because there are infinite of hostile places to &quot;conquer&quot;... and in the long run, there are no &quot;winning&quot; strategies anyway, everything dies. But if there is no joy along the way, what&#x27;s the point? Just because there is no &quot;ever after&quot; doesn&#x27;t mean there can be no &quot;happily&quot;. It somehow being preferable to die with the most toys, or being the last one to turn out the light, the very idea of winners and loosers is ALSO a made up story, a narrative, IMHO. We are stuck with giving life meaning anyway, might as well give it meaning that fulfills us in the here and now AND allows us to reach higher heights, instead living in an endless, aimless race where nobody ever feels happy, until they inevitably get knocked out of it, by others or by the heat death of the universe.<p>Evolution lead among other things to our cognition, to empathy, to cooperation, to joy. These are higher-level functions rather than basic ones. I don&#x27;t mean to say that makes them &quot;better&quot;, because evolution doesn&#x27;t care either way, but I personally like them lots. And while children for example also test their boundaries, they generally don&#x27;t seem to &quot;intend&quot; to compete with or exploit their parents or others, they want to learn and be happy and make others happy. That&#x27;s my impression, which might be worthless, but my impression it is. Some get neglected, some get broken, and those inevitably cannot see more than what they can see, they think everybody else is also empty or hurting inside, and just seeking to exploit others to get ahead - but I would claim (or wishfully think? I grant it may be the latter) that this is rather unhealthy narcissism than &quot;perfectly natural&quot;, and rather the result of a limitation or trauma, while conversely having empathy and compassion don&#x27;t preclude having elbows if need be.. it just means having <i>more</i> options than just elbows.",1434859373

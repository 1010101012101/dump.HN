Google does not sell me (yet, at least) to its advertisers. It sells screen real estate and placed links. Sure, the links are very targeted, and more specific than much (probably not all) advertising that preceded it.<p>I know that this meme is trying to make a general point, i.e. &quot;there&#x27;s a hidden cost to using this service&quot;, but I think it&#x27;s overly-general and unnecessarily negative. Many people enjoy newspapers and TV that rely primarily on advertising for their revenue. I actually find Google&#x27;s sponsored links on their search results to be very helpful on occasion, and at other times I find advertising a problem. Why the tendency to be so dismissive and over-simplify?<p>I also think that this meme is part of a general trend of finding pithy ways to sound smart without acknowledging that most issues, such as the way web services should be funded, are actually quite complicated.",1378123149

I&#x27;m not sure exactly what a libertarian fire brigade would look like, but it must likely wouldn&#x27;t have a monopoly over the high-density, thus profitable, city and indemnity to screw over the less profitable rural areas.<p>Second, you speculate on the victim&#x27;s hypothetical poorness. However, in the article it&#x27;s stated unambiguously that they had made a conscious decision to forego the fire brigade subscription. I see the practicality, but I struggle with the ethics of forcing them to pay for a service they&#x27;ve made a conscious decision they don&#x27;t want.<p>Finally, and a little off-topic, there&#x27;s a the question of contents insurance. If you&#x27;ve decided that the fire brigade isn&#x27;t for you, you most likely did not take out insurance for the contents of what looks like a mobile home. A fire in a mobile home, even when doused with water, is unlikely to leave you very many useful possessions. Never mind the structure itself, which is likely to be a write-off, even if only half burned down.<p>Given this, I assume you are as vigorous in campaigning for universal contents insurance as you are in blaming this family&#x27;s fate on libertarians?

What happens when all those middle class jobs go away and they&#x27;re unemployed or people greeters?  There is no way the same people, now much poorer, will be able to support the waitress unless her income also shrinks by more than half, which can&#x27;t happen given the fixed costs of living.  Therefore either most restaurants will go out of business other than those serving the few remaining rich, or the now poor ex-middle classes will be served by robots aka fancy vending machines.<p>One other remark you may have missed is there is a huge, and growing segment of the population who can not and never will be able to afford a smartphone.

The company I work for who designed the new Myspace and we did some early HTML prototyping of the site designs and the sad reality is you need to use this font-smoothing fix or Chrome butchers the fonts. Go and inspect the Myspace website and you&#x27;ll see this very fix is being used and you want to know why? Because it&#x27;s required and works. As are many other sites that use this fix.<p>It&#x27;s definitely a Chrome issue, this isn&#x27;t just some property designers are playing with for the heck of it. Want to see another issue in another browser? Put light text on a dark background and view it in Firefox. Fonts like Helvetica Neue especially have the problem, but any chunky font will show extra faux bold. There is no fix for this in Firefox at present.",1378121037

They create a data structure to hold state and pass that as the first parameter to each function that can be used on it.  Once I got my head around that I found I had a better understanding of the  concept of object orientated programming.",1320054935

Pixar is fundamentally a film studio that applied tech development methods to the creation of feature films. This was huge in the film world, which uses what tech people call the ""waterfall"" model. (We abandoned that approach everywhere but in government back in the 70s.)<p>On the creative side, it's true that Pixar is a director-driven studio, but all films are basically director-driven. What's more interesting is that Pixar directors get to iteratively improve the film many times. This is something that most studios CANNOT do, due to technical limitations. The ability to iterate is HUGE, and is the main reason why Pixar films are so good when they are released.<p>Basically, Pixar makes bad films -- they just never release them. Instead, they take that film and make it better, over and over, for four-five years straight. THEN, and only then, do they release it to the public. (Incidentally, this is what Apple does.)<p>Pixar has a lot of other worthy corporate values, but in the filmmaking sphere, their success is mostly a result of having better tools and processes.<p>For a non-Pixar example of that in the film world, consider movie trailers. Before the advent of computer-editing (what we call non-linear editing, e.g. Final Cut Pro, Avid, etc.), movie trailers SUCKED. They were laughably bad. After computer-editing? Much, much better. Same people, same films, DIFFERENT TOOLING. And far, far better results.<p>Sometimes, the tools really do matter. In Pixar's case, the lesson is that iteration is huge. In the tech world, the Lean Startup approach would be the equivalent model.",1320053860

I've lived in some apartments that had appliances from the 80s; mechanically, they were still sound but the colors were off, rust was forming and each felt like it took longer and was a little bit less effective.<p>One particular case was the refrigerator. No matter how much we cleaned it it smelled like mildew. As it turned out not only were the door seals bad, the internal liner was breaking down and the foam insulation had degraded. Replacing it with an A+++ rated model was the best thing to happen to us. Not only was it quieter, it only runs 1-2x per day, has more internal storage, and it cut the electric bill by 20%. This thing will pay for itself in 2 years with the electric bill savings only.<p>There are many things to be said about making old devices work again but sometimes you have to ask if it's really worth it. I'm pretty certain that old refrigerator pump would have ran for another 20 years.",1320052043

3176808,comment,3175575,3176757,1,0,anghyflawn,,,"Well, I suppose I fall into this category: I'm a grad student in the humanities, with a fair bit of math background which I don't actively use in my work (apart from some simple statistics), and I mostly program to automate away things that take too much time otherwise. I was taught Pascal in college, but in a ""monkey see monkey do"" way (for instance, we did implement linked lists, but nobody really explained pointers to us, it was just ""put a star there and it'll work""); later I picked up Python and also did a Django project. However, via a friend I discovered Common Lisp and I have never looked back; I just find it comes very naturally to me.<p>Still, I agree that something like Python is a very suitable language for somebody who just needs to simplify their lives. (At my old school they've switched from Pascal to C# now... why?)",1320051770

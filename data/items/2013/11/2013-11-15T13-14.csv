6739401,comment,6738952,6738952,1,0,throwawaykf,,,"I would advise the author not to worry about this.<p>I recently went through a job change, and to enhance my chances, I spruced up my Github profile, and put a link to it at the top of my resume. It&#x27;s not the most active profile, but all the work there are wholly self-initiated projects, all of which tackle some interesting, often original problem. One of the projects randomly ended up with a few stars without me posting that link anywhere. Having code out there would give me a little leg-up over the intense competition, right?<p>Of the dozen or so tech phone screens, not <i>one</i> asked about it. Only one asked me to talk about a personal project, and it was abundantly clear he had not looked at the Github link.<p>At least he asked. One phone screen was with a recruiter at a famous open source company, and even she had not looked at it. To be fair, it was a recruiter call and not a technical one, but I thought she&#x27;d at least acknowledged it.<p>Most of the phone screens turned into onsite interviews, and again, nobody even mentioned Github. Well, it did come up in one interview, where the interviewer was doing a deep dive into IP networking details, and I told him in an offhand manner that, y&#x27;know, I had code out there that did exactly what he was asking...<p>The companies I interviewed with ranged from a couple of startups to a bunch of US technology giants in a variety of fields, and many of them get discussed on here regularly.<p>My advice is, don&#x27;t put too much stock in your Github profile to help your job prospects. For whatever reasons, maybe the same as TFA&#x27;s, practically nobody cares. Instead, invest in practicing the same old Google/Amazon/Facebook whiteboard-a-problem style that everybody and their grandmother uses, even if the work involved is nowhere near the kind of work (some people at) Google/Amazon/Facebook do.",1384523949

Tannen, <i>You Just Don&#x27;t Understand:\nMen and Women in Conversation</i> -- she&#x27;s long\nbeen a prof at Georgetown.  There learn that\ngirls and young women want to get <i>security</i>\nfrom memberships in groups of other girls,\nand one of the main ways a girl/young woman\ncan do that is to bring to the group some \njuicy <i>gossip</i>.  So, they <i>gossip</i>.  Yes,\nthey do <i>gossip</i>.  And drawing from the\nmovie <i>Jurassic Park</i>, yes, &quot;They do form\nherds.&quot;.<p>For <i>technology</i>, that&#x27;s <i>things</i>.  In\nsimple terms, in year 1, month 1, nearly\nweek 1, in their crib, the girls are trying\nto get emotional connections with adults\nvia facial expressions, and the boys are\ntrying to hack the latch on the crib\nand write C++\ncode to automate the toy fire truck on the\nfloor.<p>The girls are interested in emotional\nconnections with people, and the boys are \ninterested in things.  The boys are seeking\nmastery over the physical world, and the \ngirls are seeking care taking via emotional\nconnections with men who have mastery over the\nphysical world.<p>The girls are interested in fashion and\ncosmetics\nboth to\nattract men and also to fit into the groups\nof other girls they want to be part of.<p>Can women do technology?  I don&#x27;t have much\ninsight into what the real limits are, but\nI&#x27;ve seen a wide range from (1) having a \nsuper tough time with 8-9th grade algebra\nto (2) work with programming languages,\nstarting with no real background at all, \ntotally blowing away some of the brightest\npeople \nin computing.\nBut, I&#x27;ve nearly never seen a girl or\nwoman who actually likes something\ntechnical.<p>Again, basically the women&#x27;s magazines\nare correct:  What girls and women\nreally like is belonging to groups of\ngirls/women and making emotional connections\nwith other people.  And that&#x27;s what \ngirls/women use <i>technology</i>, radio,\nTV, magazines, cell phones, social media,\nfor -- to belong to groups of girls/women\nand to make emotional connections with\nother people.  For the <i>technology</i> itself,\nthe girls/women don&#x27;t care, don&#x27;t care\nany more than they care that it was \na Diesel powered 18 wheel truck that\ndelivered their women&#x27;s magazine, \ncosmetics, cell phone, laptop,\nskim milk, etc.<p>Just because the women&#x27;s magazines \ndish out material based on stereotypes does\nnot mean that the stereotypes are wrong.",1384523875

6739392,comment,6738036,6738036,2,0,roymurdock,,,"I&#x27;m a little confused about a couple of the statements made in the article:<p>1. “If Kaiser Permanente releases a drug that cures all cancers, is the stock price guaranteed to go up? No, of course not. The stock price goes up or down based on supply and demand. It only responds to human action. And, therefore, the price of a stock is solely determined by how people think about the price of a stock.&quot; - Am I wrong in thinking that the price of the stock is correlated with the value of the company which is much less influenced by what stockholders think and much more based on what people think of the value of the product/service? Whoever invents the cure for cancer is going to see a huge increase in their stock price because people are going to buy their drugs, increasing revenue, profits, ROE, dividends, growth. etc. What is the author trying to say?<p>2. &quot;Right now, the only sane choice is to aim for an acquisition. But mergers and acquisitions are on average $100 million a piece. There’s no way to have a company as large as Hyperloop acquired because it’s a multi billion-dollar company. You just can’t do it.&quot; What about motorola (12.5bn) youtube (1.5bn) and instagram (1bn) just to name a few? Just because a company is valued over $1bn doesn&#x27;t mean there&#x27;s no more room for growth and a subsequent exit?<p>Shotgun Investing vs. Value Investing - Doesn&#x27;t the government sometimes fill the role of value investor?

Would you rather be Steve Jobs? rich ... but he can&#x27;t buy anything now.<p>You sound young, based on 4 years in college and 8 years working, so as an introvert keep that in mind, and realize that your mind is playing tricks on you, and making things seem bad even though you are doing great or at least good. It&#x27;s hard to self-inspect, but as an introvert you should be able to question your thoughts. Question them in a quite room, because you may just start to laugh.<p>My suggestion - don&#x27;t waste your 30&#x27;s, 40&#x27;s and 50&#x27;s chasing big score. Prioritize - get family, that&#x27;s a lot harder later in life (I would assume chasing a toddler at 45 is different than at 30, and maybe biological impossible at 50).

When my card get&#x27;s swiped at a merchant... card swiper 2.0 tries to detect my device.  If it sees it, great, lower chance of fraud.  If it doesn&#x27;t, give me a ring to see if I&#x27;m aware that my card was used or deny the charges.

To be honest I&#x27;ve gotten lazy at asking in a lot of places about how they prepare their food.<p>We have something called a chip shop in the UK, where you can buy deep fried chips, sausages, chicken and fish.   Some places keep the vat of fat for chips separate to the meat and fish friers, others mix it all up, and some chip shops (especially up norf&#x27;), use animal fats to fry in.  I&#x27;ve bought countless bags of chips only to discover small bits of fish, or find the chips taste of chicken.  Even in some places where I&#x27;ve asked and they&#x27;ve assured me otherwise.  To be frank some people are too thick to even answer the question if posed or just don&#x27;t care.  I know for a fact the veggie burgers in Grubbs in Brighton were fried in the meat friers (though that might be past practice).

For such a large city you would expect a few more places on the map yet they are so few and far between.<p>My default option when there is nothing veggie specific is to eat some place Indian. Plenty of Indian restaurants do understand that vegetarianism is the way even if they do have dead animal dishes on the menu for those encultured from an early age to eat &#x27;meat&#x27;. It would be helpful if the best Indian restaurants were on the list too.<p>One thing that does surprise me about the few vegetarian restaurants that are in London is the clientele. Places like Mildreds are packed night after night, and the punters seem that bit more vibrant, healthy, better looking, articulate and youthful than you would normally expect to find when eating out.<p>More generally, I think that something has to change regarding vegetarianism in London, much like how things have changed regarding cycling in London. As a society we cannot go on eating variants of endangered species on toast for every meal, it is just not on or necessary. Meat eaters need to lighten up a bit and put some variety into their diet.<p>Why can&#x27;t the variety of vegetarian cuisine in London be a tourist attraction? Why can&#x27;t house prices be that bit higher just because they are in an area where there is an excellent choice of vegetarian restaurants? (In the same way that being on a bicycle route adds to the value of a property.) Why can&#x27;t we have some version of the &#x27;Bake Off&#x27; on TV that is about vegetarian food, to celebrate it rather than be all preachy about how evil the meat industry is? Aside from Hitler, why is it that nobody knows of anyone famous for being vegetarian? This is particularly weird when so many celebrities, athletes, respected thinkers and others that people aspire to and respect are actually vegetarian. Where is the &#x27;Boris&#x27; or &#x27;Jamie Oliver&#x27; of the vegetarian cause?<p>Going back to the cycling situation we have had a culture shift in cycling and attitudes towards it that has not pissed off motorists. Even if they don&#x27;t cycle they don&#x27;t get uppity about those that do. We need something along the same lines for vegetarianism in London.<p>Anyway, I hope you too have ideas on how attitudes towards vegetarianism could change in London, it would be great if you could say so on your site.",1384522718

6739155,comment,6738972,6738972,1,0,zaroth,,,"I&#x27;ve wondered about adapting a live streaming video platform that would run on your smart TV which would show students the instructor as a primary UI element, and let students see the others students the instructor was seeing (opt-in per student) as a secondary element.<p>The instructor interface would be tricky to get right. I assume you would want them to be able to seamlessly move between doing the poses with the class, and switching to a watching mode where they could give personalized instruction. Their audio feedback to specific students could be private or public. You might need a specialized remote, or at least a smartphone app to control it.<p>Class size could be anything from 1:1 to 1:100s... and include a mix of student types (free, paid), and include all the stats/achievements that you would expect.<p>Of course it&#x27;s not just yoga, but any kind of fitness or personal training, P90, crossfit, etc.<p>Would people want it? Would it <i>work</i>? I have no idea... The key question I think is what are the benefits of making it real-time versus asynchronous. I&#x27;ve always found the prerequisite of actually attending a class at a fixed time helped me increase engagement versus a fully on-demand platform which I could do &quot;whenever&quot; meaning &quot;never&quot;.",1384521016

It was an incredibly liberating, unforgettable experience. The hitchhiking experience gave you a completely different experience of travel: on the way from Manali to Leh I sat clutching my head with altitude sickness as a minibus sped through the Himalayas at breakneck speed, making the journey in 12 hours or so. Whereas on the return trip, I think it took us around a week: we saw so much more of the places along the way, had views across incredible Himalayan plains from standing up in the back of pick up trucks or overlooking chasms from the cab of a lorry while the driver dragged on his cigarette. We stopped off more and talked to more people, explored more, and even did a spot of walking like the authors in the article -- sometimes this is your only option: no vehicles for 3 hours? Start walking!<p>We had backpacks though... not as hardcore ;)",1384520792

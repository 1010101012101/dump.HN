If you're looking to mimic to some small extent the success of FreeRice.com you're going to want to make the action trivial - looking at that puzzle makes me want to go away, where clicking a definition on FreeRice is easy, right or wrong.

109309,comment,109155,109304,0,0,iamwil,,,"That is partially historic.  The name scenes comes from the phrase ""mob scene"" (I didn't know what else to call it)  When I was first working it out in my head, I wanted something where people can do the same thing at the same time in the same place (like a mob).  But as it evolved, each scene didn't have to be time and place specific.<p>A safari came later.  I wanted to group scenes together like a list, or trail that I can check off as I completed it, or that others can complete as a walking tour since scenes can be location specific.  As you can see, safaris are still less mature than other parts of the site.  I'll have to do more work to make the two more distinguishable.<p>What's a ""random challenge link""?  You click on it, and every time, you see a different scene?",1202160959

Rap enthusiasts?<p>Find out where they spend their time online and hang out there.  If it's a forum, post a lot and have a signature link back to your site.  If it's a blog, comment a lot (intelligently) and eventually drop a note to the blogger for some coverage or feedback.<p>SEO, SEO, SEO.  As part of your persona thinking, figure out what your audiences searches for and be high in those results.  Don't guess.  KNOW.  Do keyword research.<p>Social media aggregators (digg, etc) require that you be funny, controversial, or useful.  If you can tweak your initial offering so that you (or better yet, your ever-changing content) can meet these criteria, you can perform well.<p>Word of mouth/virality.

Startup hackers will write essays like pg does now, except their audience will be swarms of semi-cognizant nanobots who will decide on their own if their suggestions are worthwhile.  Only the efficient ones will have their choices passed along to the next generation.  There will be great religious wars at the atomic scale as the bots try and decide where best to put their molecular parentheses. All this will happen so fast it will be unnoticeable to humans, most of whom will be too busy keeping each other entertained.",1202159720

Let's say we're going out and the other person wants some things from the store. Surely we are both capable of discussing what's needed from the store without having to formalize it so much, right?<p>So I take it that perhaps you feel that machines will always need a more formal conversation than humans? I find that a little difficult to believe, what with machine translation, OCR, voice commands and such. (None of which are perfect, but all of which are getting closer to being very useful)<p>I guess I would be interested in what part of a neural interface would not be able to provide the stimulus a programmer is already receiving from his programming IDE? And if the neural interface can make it the same stimulus, surely there would be room for improvement, no?<p>This conversation is continued in a new post -- <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=109286"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=109286</a>",1202159004

Be mindful of the quality of these users because they may not match the exact demographic that you are looking for unless you are very particular (willing to pay $$).<p>We also found that it is both more difficult and more valuable to organically grow a user base that finds good utility in your service. These users typically need more word-of-mouth (including via respected blogs) or viral messaging. A good way to get people in the door is to offer a free basic service coupled with a clear path to upgrade later to a premium service when you've ironed out your business model and service offerings.<p>Last, we've found that a good way to keep people interested in the service itself is to keep the technology open source. This builds a very involved community, ensures that if the service is valuable that it can continue, and provides excellent references later on when you will be asked if can support large numbers of users.",1202158884

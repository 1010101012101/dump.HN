Why would anyone expect security warnings would be any different than error messages?  MS dialed down granularity from Vista to 7 and the UAC is <i>still</i> a joke.<p>What's needed is something different.  I don't <i>know</i> what that thing is, but pop-up boxes are not it.<p>My pet theory atm is ""services"".  When an app installs, it can register as knowing what to do with certain data.  Say, GPS coordinates or contacts.<p>If a user wants their wallpaper to have access to that data, they'll open their GPS, or contacts app and explicitly allow the behavior.<p>That way, an app only has access to those data sources if the user explicitly sets out to grant it to them.  If it's  a conscious multi-step process, it should be pretty hard for people to accidentally grant a wallpaper access to all their personal data.<p>And given the competitiveness of mobile app stores, I doubt any app would survive that sits functionless and nagging until the user explicitly grants it a half-dozen permissions.  So they'd quickly end up asking for less, or at least delivering as much as they can with as little as they're given.<p>I know ""services"" hardly goes all the way.  But my point remains that no level of granularity will make the pop-up approach 'work'.",1280408171

All meaning is man-made, so make your own, and make it well. Do not treat life as a way to pass the time until you die.
Do not try to ""find yourself"", you must make yourself.
Choose what you want to find meaningful and then live, create, love, hate, cry, destroy, fight and die for it.
Do not let your life and your values and you actions slip easily into any mold, other than that which you create for yourself, and say with conviction, ""This is who I make myself"".
Do not give in to hope. Remember that nothing you do has any significance beyond that with which you imbue it. Whatever you do, do it for its own sake. When the universe looks on with indifference, laugh, and shout back, ""Fuck You!"".

Don't get me wrong: he (and anyone else) has every right to want to be productive, but it's odd to think that switching editors should <i>not</i> lead to some drop in productivity. Editors are important to programmers. A baseball player wouldn't expect a different glove or bat to immediately be as productive as a familiar one.<p>Katz's counter example is that he ""didnt really have to put up with a huge amount of pain when switching to Textmate for the first time. In fact, it was downright pleasant."" Note, however, that (based on what he says about his TextMate usage) all he every did with TextMate was type text. He didn't use snippets or commands much. As he says, ""When I really thought about it, Textmate wasnt doing all that much for me. It was a glorified Notepad which had working syntax highlighting and understand where to put the cursor when I hit enter (most of the time)."" So TextMate didn't hurt, but it also did help. In my mind Vim is likely to do <i>both</i>: hurt at first (it's a <i>big</i> adjustment), and help a lot later.<p>(That said, I don't think there's anything wrong with learning Vim more gradually, as he's trying now.

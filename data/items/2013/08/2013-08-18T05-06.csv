Again, I&#x27;m not saying that these were assassinations (other than the ones which are commonly considered as such).  But they&#x27;re deaths in office.<p>Actually, I was a bit surprised that there were as few assassinations as there have been (what with some 500+ high national political figures at any one time).  The Democrat/Republican balance is also interesting.<p><i>&quot;Accidents do happen [but] plane crashes can be awfully convenient,&quot; doesn&#x27;t leave me any room to debate this topic with you.</i><p>Believe it or not, I can accept issues as unresolved, though with shadings of possibility or probability one way or the other.  When I say &quot;I&#x27;m not convinced one way or the other&quot;, I mean just that.  I&#x27;ve also not really put much time into looking at any of these incidents.<p>I do leave the possibility open in the case of Wellstone and Carnahan.  The circumstances of Litton&#x27;s death (how often to airplane crankshafts break spontaneously?) are interesting.  Ryan and Jonestown:  pretty clearly a cult.<p>There&#x27;s also the case that there can be actions involving some elements of a government in opposition to others.  As Kenneth Arrow observed, firms aren&#x27;t single points, they&#x27;re structures with internal complexity.  As are governments.  Operation Northwoods and The Business Plot (<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_Plot"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_Plot</a>) are both indications that plots <i>have</i> been hatched in the US.  It <i>can</i> happen here, and very nearly has.<p>The circumstances surrounding both the Wellstone and Carnahan deaths were <i>extremely</i> politically charged.  In Wellstone&#x27;s case, former vice president Walter Mondale stood in as a candidate 11 days prior to the election.  In Carnahan&#x27;s, his name remained on the ballot and his wife served.  There&#x27;s relatively little dispute over the official investigation of the Wellstone incident, and some history of concerns with the principle pilot.  As you may recall, Carnahan&#x27;s opponent was John Ashcroft who went on to serve at Attorney General in the 2nd Bush Administration.  In both cases (as now), control of the Senate was in play.",1376805544

However, the lawsuit has its dangers too - as making Yelp liable for reviews should be possible only if it is proven beyond reasonable doubt that indeed review manipulation is a common practice at Yelp and not just a lie by a rogue salesman. I&#x27;d be very interested in a discovery process that would allow to decide this question one way or another, but I understand so far there&#x27;s no hard evidence for it. So I also understand EFF&#x27;s side when they say absent such proof it is very bad idea to make Yelp liable - and would have very bad implications on other sites, including this very forum.",1376805428

This is most often because L1B holders fall under the EB2 (employer-based, 2nd priority) permanent residency category.  If your employer&#x27;s immigration lawyer has the experience to do so and sees that you meet the definition, see if you can get classified as a &quot;functional manager&quot; (meaning that you are primarily responsible for a critical part of the business), which would put you in the L1A visa category and give you a much easier path to EB1 LPR status.

But the first condition of the insurance is that you respect your neighbours yourself according some existing arrangements (specified in your insurance). Now if anyone is too loud when not appropriate, or drunk as hell, or peeing on your lawn, the insurance company will:<p>1. Pay you a compensation.<p>2. Make investigation.<p>3. Penalize the neighbour by raising his insurance fees (or via his insurer as they&#x27;d have some mutual agreements) or demanding a compensation from him. If he does not pay, his insurance is simply cancelled without cops and jails.<p>4. For ugly cases when neighbour is misbehaving too much (killing pets, breaking windows etc.), insurance company may have also agreements with water supplier&#x27;s, wifi supplier&#x27;s etc insurance companies that supplier cuts water/wifi/etc until the guy pays a compensation. Again, without cops, laws, police.<p>And if the guy goes to journalists and alternative insurer to whom he&#x27;ll prove he wasn&#x27;t that bad, just someone is exaggerating, then that insurer will make a good PR case and steal customers from abusive insurers. Or highlight the whole neighbourhood as a weird place to be or something.<p>The main point is, it&#x27;s all done without guns and jails. This way every party has voice and can communicate their position any time they want to anyone. And insurers would have to strike a good balance between protecting customers and pissing  them off. Like any non-monopoly business is doing already anywhere in the world.<p>So in one district it could be 100% okay to smoke and get drunk, while in another people would prefer less loud activities. The idea of a regional law just does allow this to happen.",1376803950

6231760,comment,6230363,6231523,127,0,uxp,,,"I&#x27;m a trained watchmaker. I use, fix and sometimes build many of these as components of watch movements.<p>[1] Is what I know as a Geneva Drive. Back before we had fancy alloy springs and were forced to use Steel as the material for mainsprings because that&#x27;s all we knew, watches had problems where a freshly wound watch would run fast and a watch that hasn&#x27;t been wound for a day or so would start to run slow, as the strength of the spring tapered off. The Geneva Drive was a solution, though it&#x27;s more of a hack, to only let the spring release power inside the middle of it&#x27;s power arc, by preventing the watch from unwinding past a certain low point and preventing the user from winding the spring up to it&#x27;s strongest point.<p>[2] This is a simple Heart Cam. Mechanical Chronographs (Stopwatches) use these to reset the chronograph runner to zero. A hammer, represented as the horizontal pin, is released from a caught position with spring tension on it, which slams into the heart cam and forces it to reset to a predetermined position. Incredibly simple design. No matter where the hammer slams down on the cam, it is guaranteed to reset to the same place. (It&#x27;s also a golden ratio)<p>[3] This is basically the design of a modern instantaneous date wheel. The snail-cam (&quot;D&quot; looking thing) is generally affixed loosely on the gear. The worm gear drives the flat gear, naturally, which catches the snail-cam and drives it forward. As the cam rotates, it slowly raises up the hammer, which has tension provided by the spring. At a defined point, the hammer reaches the apex of the snail-cam and (since the cam is affixed loosely and is allowed some circular freedom) slams forward &quot;instantaneously&quot;. The cam will usually have a finger that then flicks forward a date wheel.<p>[4] Fusee Chain. Similarly to the reasons behind the Geneva cross (loss of power as a spring unwinds), we developed the Fusee chain to compensate for the loss of power by acting like a transmission in a car. As the spring unwinds, it uncoils the chain from the spiral wheel, which in turn will have a high-torque output at first (~ 1:1 ratio), and slowly increase revolution while decreasing power. These were highly present in English watches, but are no longer produced (as we have fancy alloys that alleviate all of the necessity of these things)<p>[5] A Verge Escapement. Another long-forgotten mechanism. Escapements are the things that regulate the output of circular motion. It&#x27;s basically a ratchet-and-pawl mechanism. You&#x27;ll generally have an oscillator (like a pendulum) attached to the lateral verge which rocks the teeth back and forth, the drive train then tries to move the escape-wheel forward, but the verge only allows one tooth to pass per vibration (a vibration is one half oscillation). The &quot;Swiss Escapement&quot; has largely replaced this mechanism. [6] This is essentially the same thing.<p>[7] The Cylinder Escapement. In the 60&#x27;s the Swiss freaked out because the Japanese started producing cheap, disposable watch movements. The result of this was a huge loss of Swiss watch companies as they struggled to compete. One of the ideas they came up with was to produce a large number of cheap watches, but they couldn&#x27;t just drop prices, they also had to retool and drop quality, substantially. The cylinder escapement was not a new invention in the 60&#x27;s, but it started to get a lot of use around then. On a personal note, these are terrible things. They were designed to be disposable, and subsequently were marketed to kids quite often. This is where a number of the Ingersoll watches came from (like the old Mickey Mouse watches). The original ones that are worth more than most startups in Mountain View are cylinder watches, and finding one that runs is the equivalent of founding a Facebook for watch collectors. [8] This is how it works when looking at it interacting with it&#x27;s escape wheel.<p>[9] The Swiss Lever Escapement. B is the pallet, D is the oscillator (Balance Wheel). Escapements essentially work all the same. They&#x27;re mostly just renditions of one idea. The swiss lever escapement was up until the mid 2000&#x27;s practically the only escapement produced in  wristwatches. The pallet stones have since been upgraded to be synthetic ruby, along with the majority of the other bearing surfaces in watches, since the introduction of this book, however.<p>[10] This is what I&#x27;d call a Daniels Escapement, or Co-Axial Escapement. If you&#x27;ve looked at an Omega watch since the mid 2000&#x27;s (as referenced above), you&#x27;ve probably heard about the Co-Axial Escapement. This is what it looks like. It&#x27;s much more complicated than any of the other escapements, and has whole books written about it, and yet is the simplest mechanism once you figure out how it ticks. It quite literally only touches the oscillator once an oscillation. All the previous escapements are required to touch the oscillator twice (once going up, once coming back down). This is literally the difference between a tick and a tock. This only ticks, it has no tock. The less interaction the pallet has with the oscillator means that there is less energy lost in it&#x27;s oscillation, and helps with both accuracy and longevity (they wear out less, and can run longer per wind).<p>[11] This is a rotary Wankel engine, like the Mazda RX. Not a watch part, but still a &quot;modern device&quot;<p>[1] <a href=""http://507movements.com/mm_212.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://507movements.com/mm_212.html</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://507movements.com/mm_097.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://507movements.com/mm_097.html</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://507movements.com/mm_064.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://507movements.com/mm_064.html</a><p>[4] <a href=""http://507movements.com/mm_046.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://507movements.com/mm_046.html</a><p>[5] <a href=""http://507movements.com/mm_234.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://507movements.com/mm_234.html</a><p>[6] <a href=""http://507movements.com/mm_302.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://507movements.com/mm_302.html</a><p>[7] <a href=""http://507movements.com/mm_294.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://507movements.com/mm_294.html</a><p>[8] <a href=""http://507movements.com/mm_295.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://507movements.com/mm_295.html</a><p>[9] <a href=""http://507movements.com/mm_296.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://507movements.com/mm_296.html</a><p>[10] <a href=""http://507movements.com/mm_313.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://507movements.com/mm_313.html</a><p>[11] <a href=""http://507movements.com/mm_425.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://507movements.com/mm_425.html</a>",1376803731

Think of cd as a goto, pushd as a call, popd as a return and dirs as a stack trace!<p><pre><code>    ..() { cd ../$* }
    cdpath=(. .. ~/src ~)

Use of cdpath can be confusing so it is best to show part of $PWD in the prompt:<p><pre><code>    PS1=&quot;%* %5. %h%(#.#.:) &quot;

This ends the prompt with a # if you are running as superuser.<p>These aliases/functions are enabled in .zshrc (<i>only</i> if run interactively -- that is, they are included below the following test):<p><pre><code>    if [[ ! -o interactive ]] ; then return; fi

The &quot;benefit&quot; of Jeroen&#x27;s mark/unmark is that these paths persist (and can be used from any window running a shell. I have not found much need for that + I can have different $dirs in different windows. Also, given that my shell windows (under screen) persist for a very long time, I don&#x27;t need symlink&#x27;s persistence!<p>Alternatively I define &quot;.&quot; to be a function that does arg specific operation (cd if a dir, acroread if .pdf, vi if text etc.).",1376802826

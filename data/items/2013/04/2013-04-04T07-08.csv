Imho, we have two huge ""blackholes"" these days that suck resources form everything that matters: the ""social everything, center around advertising, give stuff for free"" black hole at the business level, and the ""uberpolyglot everything"", from languages to OSs at the technical level.<p>> We have had to become polyglots to develop almost any current application.<p>...in my experience, by working in 2 languages instead of one, the time it takes to deliver something grows 3-4 times (!!), and there's still all the ""lost"" training time: instead of learning new paradigms, patterns and way to solve problems, people spend inordinate amounts of time learning the details of new languages. I used to <i>love</i> the polyglot way, but now I see language proliferation more as part of the problem than the solution. There <i>was</i> and advantage of all this, but now most paradigms of concurrency and everything are cross-language, and even if some languages like Clojure or Haskell injected new or better refined ideas into the mainstream, these ideas are nor longer tied to a particular language.<p>I think we should invest as much as we can in <i>unifying</i> languages and technologies, like:<p>- using one language by making a traditional client side language work server side: <i>the Node way</i><p>- cross-compiling: <i>the X to Javascript compilers</i> (like Clojure-script and Python to Js or Ruby to Js techs)<p>- make languages use libraries from other languages: not to much exciting things happening here yet :( ...but I'd love having a way to, for example, mix C, Python and Ruby libraries inside a Clojure program, regardless of the performance or security issues<p>...they all seem like ""boring plumbing work"", I know. They are neither ""exciting big problems to solve"" nor ""amazing business ideas"" and you'll most likely neither change the world nor get rich by working on such things, but you can probably make a huge difference by working on such plumbing an let the really smart guys free to invent <i>really new</i> things!",1365061892

Substitute ""aether theory"" for ""dark matter"" in InclinedPlane's comment, and his assertion of its wide confirmation would be trivially false. Many physicists at the time <i>believed</i> the aether theory to be true, but <i>confirmation</i> remained (rightly) elusive, despite very sophisticated attempts.[1]<p>I feel the need to point out that the periodic table was also built up from observed effects without knowing what the stuff actually was.

It's not an easy thing to measure accurately. I believe the explanation for the numbers is indeed the first of the two options you present, as I wrote in the original piece. As the Dr. Dobb's readership has grown vs. 2010, both in terms of unique visitors to the website and subscribers, I don't think the second option is likely.<p>>not every programmer is a Dr. Dobb's reader<p>Quite true. This is a problem inherent in all surveys. The survey size for these two questions were 1143 in 2010 and 500 in 2012, which statistically speaking would be fairly representative samples. The real rub is that programmers are not a homogeneous group, so the results will change a lot from one type of programming to another. For example, Dr. Dobb's does not cater much to embedded developers, consequently the effect that they would have on the charts is not captured.<p>If I assess the 2012 numbers based on what I know anecdotally, they seem acurrate insofar as capturing the broad trend towards polyglot programming.

Banks has done that elsewhere quite a bit. It <i>could</i> be that his imagination failed him here. Or he could have made a conscious choice, seeking a specific effect.<p>I think it was the latter. For me, part of the point of literature is to explore what it means to be human. One of the things that comes up over and over in Banks's work is encounters between developed and primitive cultures. He uses the contrasts to examine where we've come from, who we are, and where we might go.<p><i>Player of Games</i> in particular to me spends a lot of time looking at the desire to win, and also the desire to play for high stakes. The Culture's post-scarcity society makes bets meaningless. How does somebody with a gambler's nature fare in that context? And how does somebody raised in that context change when they become immersed in a society built around gamesmanship and gambling? The Azadians are an exaggeration of particular aspects of humanity because he's trying to explore those aspects. If they were more alien, you would identify with them less, which I think would weaken the impact.<p>If you're reading Banks for things like detailed descriptions of fictional games, you should probably look elsewhere.

* Then I go to bookdepository
* But there are a number of sites that does this ""social, book discovery - share what you know etc"" - goodreads, shelfari, i dream books, etc.<p>So my questions is....<p>* why is yours any different to the above?
* is there a KILLER feature you have which none of the above has?
* is the killer feature in demand?
* Ben Horowitz suggests entrepreneurs to make a product which is at least 10x better than the current incumbents.  Is yours going to be 10x better than ones that are out there and have been out there for a long time?",1365059456

However I knew I didn't want to do that and through reading Thomas's book I somehow came to the conclusion that's not needed, that I can work anywhere doing anything, while having more freedom and making more money, not the response I've gotten from most people regarding globalization mind you.<p>My then girlfriend got me Hot, Flat, and Crowded when it came out because she knew how much I liked that one so much. I had been working for a solar energy company in Southern California and the book gave me a lot of talking points to sell the product. Of course the timing couldn't have been better with the ""Million Solar Roofs Program"" our Governator enacted. I still believe that the next big revolution will be, has to be, a green revolution.<p>Here's a key part about the program I mentioned via Wikipedia (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California_Solar_Initiative"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California_Solar_Initiative</a>)<p><i>The California Solar Initiative has ""a total budget of $2.167 billion between 2007 and 2016 and a goal to install approximately 1,940 MW of new solar generation capacity."" [2]<p>The CSI initially offered cash incentives on solar PV systems of up to $2.50 per AC watt. These incentives, combined with federal tax incentives, could cover up to 50% of the total cost of a solar system. The incentive program was designed so that the incentives would reduce in steps based on the amount of solar installed in each of 6 categories. There are separate steps for residential and non-residential customers in the territories of each of the State's 3 investor-owned utilities. As of July 2012, the rebates range from $0.20 to $0.35 per AC watt for residential and commercial systems and from $0.70 to $1.10 for systems for non-profits and government entities.[2]</i>",1365058886

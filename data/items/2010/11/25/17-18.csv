Print it out, draw on it with a marker, and scan it again if you have to make sure.<p>But I've seen so many blurred out numbers that I could just about figure out with my eyes, let alone a computer program that could decode it algorithmically.  And yes, standard (and non-standard, i.e. Photoshop) algorithms are fairly well known and can be tested against known data.  Also, people really can tell what font was used.

It would need to include well-received features available in TeXShop and others, and add some extra values beyond the webapp advantages.<p>1. Targeting real LaTeX users, I think it makes sense to add some shortcut key or autocompletion for common commands.<p>2. Make it easy to go back and forth between source and preview PDF.

Apt was designed I think mainly as a workaround for Linux dependency hell, with the side effect of it being convenient to install things.  But the tradeoff is that all software updates rely on a single central location--Canonical's servers (besides PPAs).  What if they go out of business, or the servers go down for some reason one day?  The second you step outside of the Apt walled garden you're right back to the wild jungle of Linux dependency hell that makes it nigh-impossible to install anything without hair-pulling compilation sessions, in my experience.<p>And yes, PPAs have inched closer to user-friendliness with recent releases, but they're not to the point where a non-terminal user can easily comprehend the concept and then install their own.<p>Bringing this all back to the point--rolling releases--it's too difficult for many to install PPAs, and even so, PPAs don't always exist for core components that frequently have high-visibility regressions or bugs in new Ubuntu releases.  For example, in Maverick hibernate for my laptop is broken.  It freezes when it tries to hibernate.  Where do I even start looking for a PPA that solves this problem?  I don't--instead, I hold my breath for 6 months and don't use hibernate.  That's not an acceptable solution.",1290706274
1940636,comment,1939697,1939862,0,0,jerf,,,"Oh, that's easy. This company claims that the user is the only thing legally involved, and they have merely provided tools which the user is using to watch DVDs that happen to be physically located elsewhere. Therefore they are entirely uninvolved and therefore can't be said to be in violation of anything, indeed, they shouldn't even be a party to the suit; if the movie companies want to sue anyone, they will claim, it should be the end-users. The companies will claim that this is not simply a tool and that the company is actually involved in serving out streams that they do not have a license for and are therefore violating copyright.<p>The reason why this will be an exciting lawsuit to watch is not that the arguments are subtle or difficult to predict in advance, it is that they are both oqually correct. What's wrong isn't either of these arguments, it's the foundation of law they are built on, which simply can not handle this conflict. I've been waiting for this one to pop up for years. There are numerous other minefields like this waiting too.<p>BTW, the temptation to physical metaphor is strong here, but as always should be resisted. There are no physical metaphors that adequately capture the Internet and this is no exception. No, this is not merely like stringing a big wire across the internet, there are critical ways in which that differs from this situation. For instance, when I physically own a DVD it isn't possible for anybody else to know what I'm watching, and if the manufacturer goes out of business nothing happens. (Remember, it only takes <i>one</i> relevant difference to sink your argument-by-metaphor, which is why it's such a terrible argument technique and basically should simply never be used for Internet issues.) On the other hand, this is also quite clearly not identical to Netflix-style streaming, as it also has relevant differences. (So, from another point of view it is fair to say both arguments are also equally <i>in</i>correct.)<p>You can argue the ethics quite fruitfully, but I believe the legal answer to this can only be said to be undefined. There is literally no provision for this anywhere in copyright law, in fact copyright law is fundamentally built on the premise that it is possible to cleanly separate copyright issues into various distinct ""domains"" (books, music, movies, etc) which don't cross or interact. As computers and the Internet blur these domains together and create some news one, the law really can't deal with this. The system is not built to handle the idea of you owning something and consuming it from a distance, either, the particular undefined thing this company is trying to wiggle through.<p>(Which won't stop a ruling shutting these guys down this time, but at some point the law is really going to have to address this problem head on.)",1290706234

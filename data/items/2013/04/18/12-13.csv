As the cost of energy goes up, so does the rate of innovation in finding more economical ways to use it.<p>Of course, a corollary is the <i>Jevons paradox</i>: as energy efficiency goes up, demand for products that use energy also goes up when energy price is held steady. A popular example is the home refrigerator, which has gotten bigger at about the same rate that it has gotten more efficient.<p>One way around this is to ensure that energy prices continue to increase so that efficiency gains don't lead to increased overall energy consumption.

These are NOT provided by TOR but by TOR users, i.e. they are TORs Google/Yahoo (especially old time yahoo with long lists of pages instead of a search).

We have:<p><pre><code>    y = 1-t - (1-t)/t * x\n    y = 1-s - (1-s)/s * x\n</code></pre>\nSo:<p><pre><code>    1-t - (1-t)/t * x = 1-s - (1-s)/s\n    s-t = (s-t)/(st) * x\n</code></pre>\nSo:<p><pre><code>    x = st\n</code></pre>\nThe points on the curve will be generated by the intersection of two almost adjacent lines (this is easy to see geometrically), so we take s =~ t.

I've been running several entry nodes with directory caching enabled on Amazon for a year or so with no problems - nor do I expect any.<p>If you run an exit node on Amazon, you can expect to receive a C&D at some point.  I'm not sure if Amazon will intervene.  There are some services elsewhere that allow you to pay for the operation of exit nodes in bitcoin.<p>Tor is essentially just 2 proxies chained together such that the first proxy (the entry node) doesn't know the final destination, the second one (the exit node) doesn't know the source, and the final destination only knows the exit node.  If a malicious entity is operating either entry or exit nodes, it still protects your identity as long as you did not expect the exit node to send information that leaks information about yourself.  If the same malicious entity or cooperating ones get lucky and operate all of your nodes, then you are unmasked.  If you are afraid of this possibility, then you can configure your client to make a circuit of more than 2 nodes.<p>In order to find out about all of the available public nodes that you can connect to, the client queries a list of hardwired directory servers.  Here, you can get this yourself:\n<a href=""http://86.59.21.38/tor/status-vote/current/consensus"" rel=""nofollow"">http://86.59.21.38/tor/status-vote/current/consensus</a><p>If you run a public server, your information will be distributed in this list.  You can also run a private bridge, which is not shared publicly.  You will not be used as an exit node unless you configure your server to allow exit traffic.  You can specify this by port ranges, so as to only allow certain traffic.  You can see this in the above consensus document in lines that start with ""p"".  ""p reject 1-65535"" means it is not an exit node.<p>If you want to help in other ways, you can also run a directory cache that serves consensus information (as in the above link).",1366288765

It handles concatenation and minification of CoffeeScript, Stylus and Handlebar templates for us but it can work with almost any front end technology out there. A cool thing is that we can use require within out CoffeeScript files and that allows us to better organize code into modules.<p>Brunch even provides file watching capability so when we save a stylus or CoffeeScript file it will update the browser without a reload.<p>In our setup we compile everything to our django static folder so when we collectstatic, files get uploaded to s3.<p>One thing that was a bit a tricky and something that we have to make better is cache expiration of files. For now we are appending static files with a few characters from the current commit hash (app.css?e2232 something like that), while this is pretty effective we've found some cache systems that ignore it. The next step is to rename files before uploading to s3 (app-e2232.css).<p>I agree that this might be a bit too complicated for most apps but in our case (getblimp.com) we have a pretty heavy JS app and we really need to take advantage of all the ""better"" front end tools available.<p>I will be willing to contribute to FOSS project to solve this issues once and for all on the django/python side.

In only a small number of lines of text you have many errors. A spellchecker is a wonderful tool too and you would have benefited from it. Imagine this now being hundreds, thousands, even millions of lines of code. A simple misspelling in code may lead to a compile error. It may actually be a call to a different function or perhaps just the wrong seed value was set. Saying that only thinking about something rather than using a tool that can help you is just a strange and dangerous advice. Not to mention quite expensive. I don't believe the point of this tool is to ""debug your way into a new application"".<p>Again, this I just my opinion and I used your comment as my example of how tooling is important. Your misspellings could have caused confusion or a complete misunderstanding of what you were trying to convey. The same problem exists in the programming world.

5570174,comment,5569145,5569918,1,0,RobAley,,,"As I said in my first post, maximising food production isn't usually the issue. The only environmental impact you seem to cite is increased land use, and you don't seem to cover the many other environmental problems artificial fertilisers and pesticides cause.<p>Its also not clear that organic farming requires increased land use. Many people confuse organic farming with traditional farming carried out pre-""green revolution"", which is better perhaps termed ""low knowledge"" farming. To farm organically you don't simply remove the artificial fertilisers and pesticides, you use techniques such as monitored crop rotations, green fertiliser plantings, natural predation and so on.<p>I don't have much time at the moment, but a quick google instantly brings up [1] and [2] showing examples of models and actual implementations of organic systems that increase rather than decrease yield. A google or pubmed search for organic yields, organic farming, organic developing countries etc. will give you weeks worth of reading on the subject.<p>My point regarding economic conditions changing is indeed valid. A farm reliant on pesticides may be wiped out entirely by a short, small economic downturn for that farmer which means she cannot buy pesticides for a short while. This leaves the farmer in a much worse position than if they had used free, natural methods and pest management, which <i>may</i> have a lower impact but fail catastrophically much less often. When you're crops are wiped out, it really is often game over. Lets compare that to, say, a investing in a road used to transport the crops to market. The economy falters a little for a year, and there is no money to repair the road, so you can't get to market. You crops survive and have to be thrown away. Next year, or the year after, the economy picks up and the road is repaired. You've had a very hard year or two, but you've still got your crops and you can get back on your feet.<p>I can't find the study regarding the roots, it was conducted a few years back (I used to run an organic coffee company and took notice of these things), it was a study conducted in Ethiopia by several NGOs and a couple of EU Universities. I'll try and dig it out when I get home tonight and update this post. The roots either tended to grow upwards/owards (closer to ground level, not out of the ground) rather than downwards, or were shorter/fatter due to having the nutrients they needed closer to hand. During dry spells (more common without irrigation) they performed much less well than organic counterparts which could tap into the lowering water levels for longer.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0031599"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjourna...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2007/07/070711134523.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2007/07/070711134523.ht...</a>",1366287906

It might not be the clothes per se, so much as the activity and/or location they were at and the clothes just happened to be appropriate for the activity.<p>Example: Maybe girls are attacked at nightclubs a lot. You can't blame the clothes. The reason is probably because nightclubs are usually open at night. And(at least in the bay area) some of the cooler nightclubs for younger people are in sorta-questionable locations in terms of safety. And finally, if you're a young lady going to a nightclub you're probably going to dress to look attractive. The whole nightclub environment, young ladies dress up attractively... guys being guys(TM)... add alcohol... shady-looking people wandering about directly outside the nightclub... a lot of things to blame there, but clothes wouldn't be top of the list.",1366287244

But even old time apple webkit devs will readily admit that the existence of Mozilla made WebKit much more viable back in the day. Mac's had practically no marketshare during those days. The fact that Mozilla existed and had a reasonable amount of marketshare across platforms made it possible for Apple to ship anything other than IE as a default browser on Mac. Mozilla maintained the incentive for webdevs to support non-IE browsers, and use standards-compliant CSS. Desktop Safari as a default browser would not have been a viable product if so many webdevs had not already worked to make their sites work well with Gecko/Firefox. Webkit sends ""like Gecko"" in its user-agent string for a very good reason.<p>In other words, a lot of the web kept using standards (and not IE proprietary stuff) since they wanted to work in Mozilla browsers. And all of this content tended to also work well in webkit as well. This made Safari useful and viable.

A value of a node is obtained by walking through it's children, setting the value of each node as the recursion winds down. \nString reduction simply modifies the expression itself. This does not eliminate common subexpressions (a() * a() will reduce a() twice), which is why graph reduction is favoured. In a parallel world, you often don't care about the extra work if it reduces the number of synchronisation.",1366286448

It was almost impossible to chat with friends during gaming session when for example ""Akuma"" (A Street Fighter character and a perfectly safe word in Japanese as well) gets censored into ""a---a"", and Several Finnish words like ""pelata"" (to play. ""pela"" is  something offensive I guess?)  ""mutta"" ('but'... apparently it considers ""mutt"" a bad word.) and anything containing ""ass"" (ssa is the inessive suffix and Finnish has vowel harmony. Fun.) and <i>lots</i> of others get completely mutilated.",1366286440

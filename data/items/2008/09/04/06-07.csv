Then again, in today's corporate climate, big companies just go ahead with massive asshatery because they know they will get away with it.<p>It's pretty medieval, really.  That, and people in the US who are intimidated into keeping their jobs for health care.  Why do we put up with this?<p>Okay, just because you're paranoid doesn't mean you're wrong!",1220508397

For example, the Wright Brothers succeeded because the military invested heavily in the first airplanes. Other examples are the Internet, the space program, cars (highway investment), commercial airlines, etc... A lot of the big stuff is initially subsidized with public money, and then thrown to the private sector.",1220508151

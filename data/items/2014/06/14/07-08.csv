7892316,comment,7890448,7891072,2,0,saryant,,,"I got hit with this by a college roommate who joined Primerica.  I didn&#x27;t know anything about investing during college so I let him open a Roth IRA for me and put in $100/month from my part-time job.  I fell for everything from him and his boss.  Looking back, I definitely feel like a moron.<p>The fund he had me in was <i>terrible</i>.  An expense ratio of something like 1.5%, a maxed-out 12b1 fee and a front-load sales charge of 5.25%.  At least it wasn&#x27;t an annuity.<p>Once I graduated and got my first full-time job, I started reading over the 401k material and doing my own research which lead me to the Boglehead&#x27;s site.  I slowly began the realize the fraud my friend had pulled over me.<p>When I presented him with the evidence, he literally lied to my face.  That or he had so completely swallowed Primerica&#x27;s literature that he believed himself.  He tried to tell me that their fund had outperformed the market (it had not) and had stayed stable through the 2008 crash (it had not, it lost far more than the market).<p>He tried to convince me that the fees were actually quite low compared to the average (obviously not) and that Vanguard was in fact more expensive.<p>I ordered him to transfer the entire account over to Vanguard and we haven&#x27;t spoken since.<p>(Another unspoken advantage of Vanguard or Schwab: if they do something I don&#x27;t like, I can safely pull my business without risking a personal relationship)",1402732659

7892312,comment,7891171,7891171,14,0,mcherm,,,"There is something here that I really don&#x27;t understand.<p>Why would they want to shut it down?<p>With something like Twitter, I get it. In order to make money off their customers&#x27; use of Twitter&#x27;s free service, they need to be in control of the customers&#x27; experience (so they can do things like show ads). So they pulled this intentional bait-and-switch where they screwed over the independent developers who had made Twitter successful in the first place, but they did it because they needed to in order to make their profits.<p>The Netflix API story is different. First of all, APIs were always an additional offering: Netflix was grown on the backs of their mail-order business and third party apps that could just as well have been done via partnerships instead of open APIs. So they&#x27;re at least not screwing over the one who brought them to the dance.<p>But the APIs have been a source of good will from the developer community (probably all out of proportion to the number of actual tools built using them). And the APIs are not harming Netflix&#x27;s income stream in any way. (They might, in a tiny way, be helping, but I accept that this effect is negligible.) So where is the motivation to retire them?<p>Does it really cost so much to maintain the APIs? After all, they need to maintain them for Instant Watcher, Fanhattan, Yidio, NextGuide, Flixster, Can I Stream It?, FeedFliks, and Instant Watch Browser for Netflix. So it&#x27;s not like they&#x27;ll save the cost of keeping the APIs running. And I don&#x27;t see how this can be about the cost of managing communications with the public -- if, instead of announcing that the APIs were now closing down, Netflix had announced that the primary support channel was now a public forum where users could help each other I doubt anyone would have batted an eyelash.<p>So help me out here: what is the motivation?",1402732371

7892306,comment,7876833,7877790,1,0,WhoBeI,,,"Hmm.. good comment. Not how I understood the paper but I&#x27;m willing to accept that I could be wrong. I agree that we can&#x27;t generalize from trends but I felt he went a bit further and questioned the validity of any theory that makes assumptions of the past that can&#x27;t be proven regardless of how good it is at predicting the future or describing the present.<p>Darwin assumed that because he could find evidence that some animals had evolved from a recent common ancestor all animals evolve from some ancestor (roughly). Because I understood the paper as I did I thought it would be a good example. Darwin made assumptions about the past that he couldn&#x27;t prove (in his time) and used that to explain the now and predict the future.<p>Today we have plenty of proof that he was correct but back then not so much. He made an educated guess based on observations and provided ways of proving him wrong. A good method in my view. To me it seemed like the author of this paper would have told Darwin to get a time machine to prove his theory or be silent instead of trying to disprove the theory.<p>Anyways, thanks for the comment. Seems there&#x27;s more to this thing then I thought so I&#x27;ll study it some more.",1402732081

My biggest takeaway from that experience is that build management, testing and release management are the hard parts once you get beyond the first few platforms. The only platforms that posed even minor problems in the traditional coding sense were ones in their infant stages (e.g. WiiU, Xbox One and PS4 years before their release) where hardware, APIs and even compilers are full of holes, and you have to deal with SDK updates (including deprecated APIs) and devkit refreshes. Automate everything you can and grit your teeth for the rest of it.<p>Purely on the coding side of things, I would caution against extremism when fighting code duplication between platforms. There is much to be said for having a single C file per platform that is self contained, even if it entails a certain level of duplication. The alternative very easily leads to an increasingly bifurcated decision tree that tries to account for similarities and differences between platforms (autoconf syndrome).",1402731121

The only real difference is for a foul they hold the flag straight up and wave it a little. For offside they hold it straight up and stand still to mark where the offside occurred. The line referee should <i>always</i> be located at the exact line that marks offside. Of course pro players are faster than referees, but to get past level 7 refereeing (starts at level 9, kids games, level 7 is probably high school games, state level, etc) you must pass fitness exams as well as paper exams. Level 2 is FIFA assistant referee, so they must all be in quite good shape.",1402729734

Handy not just for when you rm -rf / , but also for when you suddenly find yourself lacking in usable tools.  For instance, I&#x27;ve had an upgrade break the dynamic linker (/lib/ld-linux.so.2 or /lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2), and suddenly no dynamically linked program runs.<p>However, the solution given here assumes you have a bash compiled with support for /dev/tcp.

Successful founders don&#x27;t use the word failure, nothing is a failure to them.<p>People who are depressed -- it doesn&#x27;t matter if those are founders or not -- tend to let external circumstances determine the mood or happyness level. Most people are happy when it&#x27;s good weather and sad if it is raining, successful people do not let something like rain influence their mood level.<p>The question is rather why the topic &#x27;depression&#x27; pops up quite often on HN.<p>My theory: I had very successful times as a founder and also -- let&#x27;s call them -- &#x27;slow&#x27; times as a founder, in particular in the beginning. When I had successful times I didn&#x27;t check HN for months a single time, when I had &#x27;slow&#x27; times, I checked HN every 30 minutes.<p>-",1402729556

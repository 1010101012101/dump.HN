60194,comment,59988,59988,0,0,david927,,,"This article really hits the nail on the head with why I think there's a Web 2.0 bubble.  People are not starting firms because of they think they can bring something both unique and compelling to a particular area, but because they want to have a start-up.  Oh, and get filthy rich too.  The investors are as much to blame by throwing cash at them.  Facebook.  10 billion.  My ass.<p>I love having my own company, but I also know what a roller coaster ride it is and that if you're not in it for the right reason, you're just going to come away with trauma and bruises.",1190878846

All of the logos we've gotten from designers sucked so far.  Besides, we're having some fun with it.  If you don't think design contests are fun, that's fine.<p>No, Kevin doesn't do freelance work.",1190878112

Even the purest BS misfeatures are celebrated.

60191,comment,60096,60096,0,0,shiro,,,"Floating-point to decimal conversion is a little bit trickier than usually thought (cf. Steele&White, ""How to Print Floating-Point Numbers Accurately"", SIGPLAN '90, pp.112-126, 1990. and also Burger&Dybvig, ""Printing Floating-Point Numbers Quickly and Accurately"", PLDI '96, pp.108--116, 1996.), and tweaking the algorithm can easily introduce special cases in the code path.<p>Now I don't have any idea why Excel had such special cases around 65535, but this incident seems to confirm my growing suspicion that it is wrong not to test 100% of code paths.  Some of you may say off course it is, but I've seen programmers that just test a few sample points and then bombarding the code with random input and say it's working.   I myself have been bitten by some bugs hidden in rare code paths since I was lazy to construct a special input that tests the path, which sometimes takes some effort.  (I haven't used automated test case generation tools; any opinions?)

60190,comment,60184,60184,0,0,rms,,,"What happens if all the logos you get suck? Do you still have to pay a winner $500, even if you don't use that person's logo? How are you going to handle revisions?<p>The best designers are far too busy getting paid to make a logo that probably won't get them any money and they also don't need the publicity. I have a friend who had worked with a positively brilliant designer from Uruguay. The designer's quote for a logo for me was $500 for delivery within a month and $600 for less than a week.<p>If this gets you extra publicity, great. But I think you'd have a better chance of getting a great logo if you just found a logo designer with great style and paid that person $500. Does Kevin Hale do freelance logos?",1190877038

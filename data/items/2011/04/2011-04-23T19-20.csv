2477411,comment,2476861,2476861,15,0,grellas,,,"<i>[H]ot-metal printing is a thing of the past. The costs (passed along to clients, of course) were simply too high, and so digital printing has replaced it</i><p>I started working in Big Law in 1980, right when large law firms were at the tail end of using centralized mini-computers with dumb terminals spread throughout the firm. Every few days, we would receive memos (hand-carried by an in-house messenger - there was no form of email or instant messaging then) asking us to fill out a form telling the IT staff which of our computer documents no longer needed to be stored on the central system. The firm had to continually delete old documents to free up storage space. I imagine that it could have added storage capacity but the cost at the time was very high. On the software side, there was no mass market software available and the software we used was a proprietary system of very limited functionality that came with the Wang system.<p>This piece (which is extremely well-written, by the way) reminded me of how we used to do redlining of legal documents in that era. No software was available to do this automatically or in any kind of expedited fashion. Therefore, to show, e.g., what changes had been made to a contract from the last cycle, attorneys would line up printed versions of the contracts side-by-side, with the old draft on the left and the new on the right. With a ruler in hand, they would go down the left side line-by-line while manually comparing it to the contract on the right. If they came upon a deletion, they would use a pen to cross out the relevant language as a way of showing that deletion in the new draft. For an insertion, they would hand-write the insertion in the margin or at the bottom of the new draft and hand-draw a line/arrow from the point of insertion to the added text (of the text were too long, the new text would be separately typed out, marked as ""Insert A"" (or whatever was next in sequence), and the contract itself would be marked with an insertion point instructing the reader to ""See Insert A."" This process would take many hours to do with a lengthy contract and would need to be double- and triple-checked for an important document to avoid the  errors that would inevitably mark such a painstakingly detailed process. When the document came back from the other side, this same manual, time-consuming process would be repeated. And so the iterations would continue until the final, execution versions were prepared and signed. Clients were charged for every minute of attorney/paralegal time involved. The results were first-class but hugely expensive to clients. This sort of legal work was done almost exclusively for large, institutional clients. No small business could afford it, as it easily added large legal costs to a negotiation process.<p>Times have changed indeed. If you just imagine what it would be like to work with no email, no text messaging, no cell phones, no quality software, no internet, no personal computing (other than with ""toy"" computers) and the like, you will be thankful for the marvelous tools we have today. Among other things, legal services will never be the same.",1303588343

That is, if xy = z, there might be multiple y's for a given x and z. (Edit--previously I had said it's because it's not a field, but that's a stronger condition than we need.) If the sum is 2 and the sum of squares is 0, then (1, -1) and (2^63 + 1, 2^63 - 1) are both solutions.<p>You could do this solution using the field of bitfields modulo a 64-bit irreducible polynomial, but I expect that's over the heads of most interviewers :P<p>(edit: just realized that you can do the neccesary field multiplication and addition very quickly in constant time and space. It's even linear in the number of bits you have to process. This looks very close to an ideal solution, so I posted a link on the blog. There may be a clever solution that is better.)<p>(edit #2: the clever solution is just to use bigints. The sum of squares is guaranteed to fit in 192 bits. This might be what the parent poster meant all along. This works because integers are a factorial ring, so the equations are guaranteed to have a unique solution.)",1303588208

For each element, test whether it is present in the set, and then add it to the set. By testing whether the element is already in the set, you identify the <i>duplicated value</i>. After creating your complete Bloom filter, then test integers 1 to N to see which is not in the set; this is your <i>missing value</i>. I believe this should be constant space and linear time.<p>Above I said ""probably"" because there are false positives (though not false negatives).",1303587464

Not every trend is a bubble, not even every exponentially-expanding trend is a bubble. Cigarette smoking, for example, expanded exponentially to virtually every nation on earth once tobacco was moderately widespread level. Epidemics often follow exponential growth patterns too but are not ""bubbles"".<p>Bubble are specific to the investment process because the investment process is where prevailing beliefs can drive short-term prices but long-term prices requires more ""fundamental"" qualities. Just as much, since a bubble dynamic requires not just high but expanding prices, bubbles are limited, at the minimum, that total amount of investment funds of a society.<p>Now, it should be noted that the investors driving an ""education bubble"" are not the ""education consumers"" - these consumers don't even have any money! The real investors are the government and the educational institutions. Together, this group is shoveling money into the education system with the expectation of getting more back later, with interest. For-profit educational institutions add to this dynamic by allowing unlimited further  money to enter into the equation. That government guarantees this racket and doesn't, itself, expect a profit, only heightens this ""problematic dynamic"" (like the home-loan scam only ""pre-bailed out"").",1303587376

Do some googling on caffeine tolerance and caffeine dependence - something like 300mg of caffeine a day for 3 weeks and you are fully tolerant and typically caffeine intoxication starts around 500mg. 300mg is often one large latte. Caffeine binds to adenosine receptors and prevents proper sleep. It's also worth noting that caffeine has a half life of 6 hours and stimulates with a burst of adrenaline that is much shorter lasting than the adenosine binding which prevents proper sleep. Caffeine is a useful tool to have in the toolbox, but long term addiction leads to decreased performance, not increased performance.

Think about it in terms of interest rates and the cost of money, not in terms of becoming their partner.<p>Furthermore, you might find that you can secure collateral for your loan.

He's absolutely right if you assume that inherited wealth, race, and schooling are all independent of IQ. But there's plenty of evidence to show they aren't. So he's not right. In fact, his analysis is quite representative of a certain kind of study you see every so often: you can always make the IQ effect disappear by relying on IQ-correlates instead. I can give you a half-dozen papers that use the same trick. Nobody is impressed by them.<p>Now, instead of copying and pasting from Wikipedia, maybe you should actually look into the literature in the future. You'll come up with a much fairer sampling of what's out there.",1242938530
621092,comment,620739,620739,0,0,lutorm,,,"There are many things that make the analogies made in the article not applicable.<p>If I buy a Pokemon, I can crank out a review in probably 5 min after playing with it for a while. Contrast that to peer review: to write a careful review of an article takes me at least a full work day to make sure that I understand what's done, think about possible pitfalls and weaknesses, and then write a comprehensive and helpful review. No one will put in that amount of time to write a comment on a web page, so the only people that can offer substantial comments would be those that have taken the time to understand and think about the paper for other reasons (usually because it directly concerns their own work). The problem is then that even if these few people actually make comments, they are likely to be totally drowned out by people who make useless comments (either because they don't understand the paper or because they have no incentive to make an effort).<p>Regarding the shoe store, that's also a false analogy. A shoe store selling shoes is akin to a scientist publicizing their finished papers, they have nothing to lose by revealing their design because they already have them in the store. A better analogy would be to ask: if Nike's having some problem figuring out how to manufacture a shoe, do they ask Reebok for advice? Since Reebok works in the same field, they likely would have useful advice to give, but they don't because the danger of Reebok taking the design and running with it is too large. That's how it would be with scientists openly sharing their works in progress.<p>I'm not debating that the progress of science would be helped with more open sharing, but offering questionable analogies does not help in understanding the problem.<p>However, the problem of conflicting incentives is a very real one. As long as scientists are judged based on the numbers of published papers and numbers of citations, there's an incentive to hoarding data to squeeze every last possible paper out of them. Also, there really is little incentive to share tools with the community apart from gaining recognition. This is compounded by people being bad at citing papers describing tools, too, so you don't even get that reward.",1242938441

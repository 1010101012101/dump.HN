For those who are not on equal footing, what other ""class"" can they take?""<p>Whatever class they like (Math, science, etc.). Preferably one they are better at than Chinese.<p>""""Good inequality"", that is, inequality resulting from differing levels of productivity, is only relevant when everyone starts at roughly the same level.""<p>So you're saying that since people are born with differing abilities then they should all get paid the same?<p>You understand that one of the chief ways to motivate people to be more productive is to pay them for it. Who would be willing to work start up hours if you only got paid the same as someone who worked 40 hours a week?",1183434996

The best thing to do is to grade you accordingly, and for you to find some other class to study.",1183434059

But the odds for a good team are not as bad as they might seem.  At least a third of the applications are egregiously broken: 13 year old founders, people who want to ""telecommute"" from India, people who want us to fund their plumbing supply store,  etc...",1183433365

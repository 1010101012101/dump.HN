In this case, it didn't even sound like a real freemium model anyways - a free version and a paid version of the same one-time purchase is a pretty weak place to start with freemium. Better would have been to giveaway the first purchase and then aggressively upsell on an annual subscription offering that included variations for all holidays or something similar.<p>By offering a free one-time purchase and positioning it against a paid one-time purchase you are making it too easy for people to choose free.

Dynamic typing makes compiling efficient code very difficult.<p>Of course, a good static typing programming language should have at least some kind of type inference mechanism to allow the programmer to leave out explicit type declarations when a compile can infer them from the program source code.<p>Boo is a statically typed, type-inferring language for the CLR that has a Python-like syntax.

I've been ruminating a post on the topic myself, but the core is that it comes down to two basic problems: One, willpower, since we're surrounded by terrible, yet yummy food, all the time, and two, flavor. It is occasionally mumbled, instead of yelled loudly as it should be, that if you want to eat healthy on the long term it isn't just a matter of cutting out something, you need to be <i>happy</i> with the food. And in particular, ""The Standard American Diet - carbohydrates"" isn't a very pleasing diet. It's very easy for it to become monotonous and feel restrictive.<p>But I'd submit that's an indictment against the standard diet, not the ""- carbs"". It's taken me a while to work out how to deal with the correct diet longterm, but it has involved using a lot more oils (sesame, olive, etc), more butter, more oriental ingredients, and learning a lot more about French cooking. And you have to erase the last vestiges of the false idea that fat is bad, and realize that <i>low-fat</i> is bad and is the fad diet, and it should be entirely stomped out of your dietary plans. Now I don't have problems eating properly for years without backsliding; as tempting as the carbs can be, they just aren't as good as what I'm making myself. They're a hollow pleasure.",1325519051

Somebody has clearly had an opinion on how an online banking interface should work, and that somebody has stuck to it.

But I would say that this is just because programming is hard - so hard that even those of us that are good enough at it to program for a living still struggle.  It seems to me that the really good programmers are the ones that recognise just how rubbish they actually are at programming and try to do everything to make their code as easy to understand as possible.  Functions that take up less than one screen, files that never have more than a thousand lines of code or so, using interfaces so that you don't have to understand implementation details, unit tests so that you can have confidence in a block of code and not have to doubt details when debugging, checking input values for functions.  These are all things that you see in code written by those recognised as being good programmers, and yet they are all techniques that aim to reduce cognitive load when reading code.  I don't think this is a coincidence.<p>So, if those of us that are good at this only just manage to get over the bar of adequecy, it stands to reason that there must be a lot of people that just don't make the grade, assuming a normal distribution of programming skill.",1325518436

Counting calories is a tough job, especially for an engineer like me (and I <i>like</i> counting calories), just because I don't cook consistently, I eat out where I don't know how much I'm consuming. Get a burrito for lunch? That can vary 100-200 calories depending on how it's made day to day.<p>Losing 45 lbs is a lot of work. After all that, how can you gain 35 lbs and not notice or try not to counteract it? I weigh myself a couple of times a week and it's easy to keep a running average of that. 5 lb variation is noise, but when you're starting to hit 10+, you should be taking notice.<p>I am assuming the OP exercises (as that's KEY to keeping weight off). You need to treat it like a feedback cycle: are you starting to gain a little? Ok, then be a little more cognizant of what you eat (cut down amounts, leave that last bite on the plate, really make sure you don't eat candy or soda) and crank up the energy expenditure and exercise (try to walk an extra couple of miles extra couple of days a week, make sure you take the stairs every time, etc).<p>Calorie counting is a great tool, but is inadequate because your metabolism changes as you attempt to lose weight. Your body resists change. It's also difficult to truly estimate your caloric expenditure in a given day. Your daily pattern of activity may have changed slightly in a way that you now burn 100-200 fewer calories--that can add up.<p>Carbs are not the root of all evil and many factors affect your hunger and metabolism. Here's a great science-sourced article: <a href=""http://www.theglobeandmail.com/life/health/fitness/exercise/fitness-research/the-big-fat-question-how-do-we-actually-lose-weight/article1871400/page1/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.theglobeandmail.com/life/health/fitness/exercise/...</a> -- e.g. ""the results showed the best predictor of weight loss was how closely the subjects had managed to stick with their prescribed diet""<p>Also, studies suggest that the more you exercise, the less diet matters: <a href=""http://sweatscience.com/the-more-you-exercise-the-less-diet-matters/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://sweatscience.com/the-more-you-exercise-the-less-diet-...</a><p>So, make sure you're out there burning those calories.

Measure the time.<p>2) Take a miniture blackhole, drop it. Measure the time.<p>While earth's pull will be the same on both the basketball and the blackhole, the blackhole's pull on earth will be much much grater than the basketball's and hence the additive acceleration will be larger.<p>But, if you drop them at the same time, next to each other, things will even out since the earth will move towards them both as it moves towards the one.<p>What do I win?",1325517412

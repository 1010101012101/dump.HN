6096131,comment,6095152,6095391,3,0,vidarh,,,"Customs can stop (or try anyway) to stop importation of illegal porn in physical form. Police can try to stop it from being sold on the high street (but they can&#x27;t even stop me from being hassled by people selling poor quality pirated DVD&#x27;s), but the big difference here is that while they can do that for physical objects, ever attempt at stopping this online is trivially easy to circumvent.<p>They <i>can&#x27;t</i> regulate it. The cost of setting up a HTTP proxy for personal use is the cost of a tiny VPS - I can get one for a month for about the cost of one of those pirated DVD&#x27;s, and for a quarter for the cost of a takeaway. Heck, if I was a teenager today, and had parents that signed up for even the optional filter, I&#x27;d spring for a VPN/VPS - it&#x27;s a fraction of what most kids around here pay for smartphones already anyway.<p>If this filtering stops peoples access, it&#x27;ll create a market for VPN accounts targeted for that type of use, or &quot;just&quot; encrypted http proxying.<p>They can try to stop the VPNs - good luck; IP hopping by spinning up cloud instances all over the place as needed and providing a browser extension to keep the list of proxies up to date will be trivial. They can try to stop people paying for these VPN&#x27;s, but even if they manage to stop card payments, that&#x27;ll only drive up the demand for things like Bitcoins.<p>In other words: The same restrictions will not apply. The restrictions will apply for those who do not care enough to sign up to (trivially simple, once more people decides to try to make money off it) ways to circumvent them. But the barrier is so much lower. And it will keep lowering, rather than rising, as each new attempt at blocking gives more of us incentives to prepare countermeasures.",1374673786

I&#x27;ve asked myself &quot;how much time do you think you have&quot; all the time in my 20&#x27;s.<p>&quot;Youre Talented, But Talent is Overrated&quot; - maybe, but this is also very often used just as a buyer&#x27;s tool in negotiation.<p>&quot;Were More Productive in the Morning&quot; - although I do not disagree on anatomical grounds, I almost always find myself surrounded by noise and interruptions in the morning, when everyone is active. That is a bad environment for me to get the things done and for that I very much appreciate the late evenings. My advice is to study yourself and the environment before committing to decisions.<p>&quot;Pick Up the Phone&quot; - this is amusing.<p>&quot;Be the First In & Last to Leave&quot; - if this comes as an advice then it&#x27;s propaganda. If one wants to get ahead and finds useful staying among the mentors, then getting the most of it by having a long work-time may come only naturally. If it doesn&#x27;t, then the offer of one&#x27;s extra time comes only at others&#x27; benefit, and encouraging that with an advice is a dirty practice opening a door to abuse.<p>&quot;Dont Wait to Be Told What to Do&quot; - this is good, but also abused. It&#x27;s a shot at something vague - you may do that and be appreciated with appropriate rewards, or you may as well be just used and be &quot;appreciated cheap&quot;. Responsibility is a resource that should be traded separately.<p>&quot;Take Responsibility for Your Mistakes&quot; (&quot;when youre early on in your career&quot;) - absolutely. It may come as a contradiction with &quot;Your Reputation is Priceless, Dont Damage It&quot;, but if there is a time for mistakes, then it is when you&#x27;re young. People tend to be less forgiving when you&#x27;re getting older.<p>&quot;You Should Be Getting Your Butt Kicked&quot; - no. My first boss was a kind of Steve Jobs. I learned and accomplished A LOT under his command but my life was a hell. Despite the gains, I wouldn&#x27;t do that again, and although considerable time passed since then, I still consider that former boss of mine a model of how one SHOULD NOT be. I would therefore not recommend this advice to anyone, we should keep in mind that we are humans and we should be treated as such.<p>&quot;A New Job a Year Isnt a Good Thing&quot; - this is political. When the easiest way for an employee to get a raise is to change jobs, this kind of advice may come just as a move in a larger political strategy - we as employers may be competitors, but after all we still have a common interest in having resources (human included) for a low price, don&#x27;t we? Knowing this, would you as an employee still follow this advice?<p>&quot;People Matter More Than Perks&quot; - that&#x27;s subjective (because I would argue that everything that contribute to the quality of life is important), but for an outsider perks my be visible whereas people aren&#x27;t. If you have good people in your company, do them (and yourself) a favor and treat them well - they deserve it, don&#x27;t they? Quality of people should not come to be compared with benefits.<p>&quot;Map Effort to Your Professional Gain&quot; - yes, but again this can be (and often is) used by others to abuse you.<p>&quot;Speak Up, Not Out&quot; - depends on the company culture and the level of receptiveness. If the company is toxic and it has only deaf ears, the best thing an employee can do is to prevent others to get intoxicated. That is like a civic service, isn&#x27;t it?<p>&quot;You HAVE to Build Your Technical Chops&quot; - absolutely (although it is difficult to predict which of the current ninja-rated skills may be considered tomorrow &quot;meh&quot;).<p>&quot;Both the Size and Quality of Your Network Matter&quot; - yes, although not for all activities. In engineering &quot;what you know&quot; is everything.<p>&quot;You Need At Least 3 Professional Mentors&quot; - mentorship may give you a boost in learning, but that&#x27;s it. Ultimately it&#x27;s just you. Be aware of this, or the mentorship may become overrated just as like talent might be.<p>&quot;Pick an Idol & Act As If&quot; - I used this a lot in my 20&#x27;s, but I must say that this may give you directions but not knowledge and it won&#x27;t bring you much that relies on knowledge (and also, being capable of acting like some idol presumes having exactly this KNOWLEDGE about the idol&#x27;s behavior).<p>&quot;Read More Books, Less Tweets/Texts&quot; - agree, although considering the scarceness of time I wouldn&#x27;t suggest just any kind of book.",1374673461

Yes: if you do this, it will crash. However, as I stated, the history of this language sets us up so that this should not happen: a selector should uniquely identify a calling signature to the best of the abilities of the programmers involved (and generally it will by accident for anything but very short names).<p>The reality is that this is actually not just convenient but somewhat required, as the compiler has to select a specific calling convention at compile time, so if you are using an object in a situation where it is even remotely ambiguous you get a compiler diagnostic if there is any ambiguity in the libraries you are working with with respect to the selector&#x27;s type signature.<p>Again, with blocks, this all breaks: you can&#x27;t even get a warning, because the user has to cast it first to a specific calling convention, and it isn&#x27;t obvious in the code, because the cast is allowed to be implicit. The chance of an overlap is high, because the conceptual selector&#x27;s name is effectively nothing. Objective-C mitigates this problem elsewhere: not here.<p>> All objects are also represented with the same character, and all function pointers are ^?. This may be unfortunate, but isn&#x27;t really about blocks; in pure C, of course, they are only erased inasmuch as all types are erased.<p>A) It is not relevant that the class of an object is erased, because what&#x27;s important is the type of a message implementation: you don&#x27;t break the type system by having an object of the wrong class, only by sending a message with the wrong calling convention. It doesn&#x27;t matter at all, therefore, whether objects are all &quot;erased&quot;: there wasn&#x27;t information there to begin with.<p>B) It is not relevant that C function pointers have their type erased, because they aren&#x27;t also objects: the whole point of objects in Objective-C is that they are dynamically typed (back to point A: their type is irrelevant), so you are expected to use them as arguments to things like withObject: and then let them implicitly cast back on the other side. Again: selectors are king.<p>C) It is not relevant that in pure C types are &quot;erased&quot; as C does not have a runtime, so I&#x27;m not even certain how one could determine the difference between the types being erased and the types not being erased. The erasure wasn&#x27;t even the core problem, remember: the erasure only makes it impossible to have runtime fixes for the actual problem, which is the compile-time selector slop.",1374671282

Whistleblowing is about informing the citizen about secret actions made by the state (or rich company) that shows corruption or lies. If the action is not secret, then there is nothing to blow about. If the state do not deny spying or corruption, then what can the whistleblower say? &quot;Oooo, look!

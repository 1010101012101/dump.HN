7670453,comment,7668383,7670301,7,0,GuiA,,,"The word &quot;intuitive&quot; is casually thrown around when talking about interfaces, and yet it has a very specific meaning in HCI, far from what most people believe. As posted in another comment: <a href=""http://www.asktog.com/papers/raskinintuit.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.asktog.com/papers/raskinintuit.html</a><p>I don&#x27;t deny that GUIs have their uses, and that there are certain use cases where they do outperform text-based keyboard-driven interfaces. But the reality is that those use cases are nowhere near as overwhelmingly numerous as GUI proponents make it out to be, and that for the vast majority of text driven tasks (including email, instant messaging, engineering work, doing your taxes, operating points of sale, etc.) they are superior in most regards. Note that I do not advocate abandoning all graphical tools on the computer - you&#x27;re naturally always going to need an image editor, a video player, something to edit 3D models, etc. The framebuffer is always valuable; GUIs, not so much.<p>On top of that is the consideration that a lot of our computer use these days converges in the browser, which is a very unusual beast altogether. We originally designed the browser to view documents, and it has now evolved in a weird steam machine that does pretty much anything and everything. It&#x27;s problematic, because the web is notable for being &quot;disrespectful&quot; of concerns such as accessibility to handicapped users. (note that the best citizens when it comes to such matters, such as Hacker News, Wikipedia, Reddit, and quite a few others, aren&#x27;t that far off from purely textual interfaces)<p>Obviously it&#x27;s going to be hard for me to convince you otherwise in a HN comment. That being said, if you have a genuine interest in the topic, I recommend that you read Jef Raskin&#x27;s &quot;The Humane Interface&quot;, and Ted Nelson&#x27;s series &quot;Computer History for Cynics&quot;. They&#x27;re a good introduction that allows one to think about the design of computer interfaces independently from the GUI mindset that has imposed itself on the profession over the past couple of decades. The modern GUI (which is really Xerox Parc&#x27;s GUI) is really not all it&#x27;s made out to be, and there are many compelling things about the alternative branches (check out for example Plan9, for something completely different).",1398812002

Looking deeper, this language is more amazing then it leads on to be.<p>But for a little story time: I&#x27;ve started my first major project in Haskell while sick the past week, and it had me asking lots of questions:<p>Why do I have to add so many parentheses to get it to compile?  Why can&#x27;t I just pass monads into my functions?  Why is every function not polymorphic?  Why do I get so many pattern matching errors even with -Wall? :(  The last one stings the most, believing my program would never crash.  But every function being polymorphic really got me thinking, since instancing type classes with Monads was my first instinct.  It felt so natural.<p><pre><code>    instance (Monad m, Num a) => Num (m a) where\n        (+) = liftM2 (+) -- ((return 123) + (return 321)) -- yipee!\n        ...\n</code></pre>\nI realize that type classes are global, and could have cascading problems.  Even still, this made me want to prototype a language where all functions are polymorphic, but after looking over Avail, it seems to answer all my questions.  It feels like a Lispy haskell; static type checking, with context sensitive polymorphism.<p>With this kind of polymorphism, one of my first thoughts was what the code compiles in an unintended way due to the way I specified.  The metaphor I thought of to reason about this was: a copilot in the car tells you &quot;Turn right here&quot;.  Are they saying to turn right at the next intersection, or that this is the intersection that you should be turning at?  This example shows succinctly shows that it&#x27;s a problem with the language being define (i.e. the code), that &quot;right&quot; is overloaded to mean a direction, or immediately.<p>Anyways, I would love for anyone to weigh in, since I&#x27;ve been thinking about this a lot recently!<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shakespeare_(programming_language)"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shakespeare_(programming_langua...</a>",1398811920

That&#x27;s because the ratio isn&#x27;t exactly 3:2 and the frequencies of the pure notes start to get out of alignment (the same phenomenon causes &#x27;beats&#x27; when two similar but not exactly equal frequencies are played together).<p>It&#x27;s even more pronounced when you play a C major chord (C-E-G) because the major third (C-E) isn&#x27;t exactly 5:4 and the minor third (E-G) isn&#x27;t exactly 6:5 either.",1398811701

As I understand it,  there is a school of thought that each piece in Bach&#x27;s &quot;Well Tempered Klavier&quot; was written for the sound of that key in a keyboard instrument tuned using the well temperament.<p>In addition to being tempered, the entire scale of a piano from bottom to top is &quot;stretched&quot; slightly by a mainstream technician.<p>Also as I understand it, harpsichords tend to use historical tuning methods. One possible reason is that the musician had to tun the instrument quite frequently, as opposed to the much more mechanically stable piano.<p>Students who study string instruments (as I did) are taught that intonation is somewhat malleable for expressive purposes.

If we curry a 5-argument function &quot;foo(a, b, c, d, e)&quot;, we get a nesting of 5 functions, each accepting one argument &quot;foo(a)(b)(c)(d)(e)&quot;. The implementation in the article, as well as my own, go slightly further and <i>also</i> allow curried functions to accept multiple arguments at once, eg. &quot;foo(a, b, c, d, e)&quot;; this is just for convenience though, a &quot;real&quot; curried function must accept arguments one at a time. Note that in Haskell syntax, there is no difference between the two: &quot;foo a b c d e&quot;.<p>Alternatively, &quot;partial application&quot; takes some argument values now, returning a function which accepts the rest later.

Much of the feminist campaigning on sexual assault and rape is based around the claim that they&#x27;re gendered forms of violence against women that don&#x27;t generally affect men. Indeed, quite a lot of feminists use the exact 2010 CDC report mentioned in the article as evidence that men don&#x27;t get raped (usually by not counting men who are &quot;forced to penetrate&quot; despite saying they consider this rape). Yet because feminism is supposedly not about men, anyone who challenges these claims is accused of making everything about men and derailing the discussion away from women&#x27;s suffering, because &quot;it&#x27;s not about the men&quot;.<p>Quite a lot of the feminists who do this don&#x27;t even realise that they&#x27;re not including many men who meet their definition of rape, simply because the issue was never mentioned by anyone with a wide audience until a few months ago.<p>Also, despite men&#x27;s issues not being a part of feminism, quite a few feminists loudly insist that feminism is the real movement helping men, that anyone who disputes this is obviously just out to disparage feminism and not really trying to help men, and that because all men&#x27;s problems are caused by patriarchy it&#x27;s unfair to call feminists out for supporting those supposedly patriarchal ideas.

The other intervals (2nd, 3rd, 6th, 7th) can be either diminished, minor, major, or augmented. The major interval is what you&#x27;d get if you&#x27;re measuring the intervals on a major (Ionian) scale; minor is -1 half step, dimished -2, augmented +1.<p>My intuition about which intervals are major / minor and which are diminished comes from the intervals that create the differences between the major and minor scales. The major scale uses all major intervals; natural minor uses minor 3rd, 6th and 7th; Dorian minor has a major 6th, and harmonic minor a major 7th. That still doesn&#x27;t account for why the 2nd is called major / minor -- you could argue that you use it in Phrygian mode, but then you&#x27;d have to acknowledge that you use the diminished 5th in Locrian mode, so why not call that the major / minor 5th? (But almost no music is written in the Locrian mode).<p>Another intuition is that the fourth and fifth are the most consonant intervals (because the ratio of their frequencies is simplest) and so an adjustment of a half step is more of an increase in dissonance than a similar adjustment on another interval.<p>Finally, non-perfect 4th and 5th intervals are simply encountered much less frequently than other intervals (with the exception of the tritone between the 3rth and 7th of a dominant V chord, the characteristic dissonance that sets up the V-I authentic cadence).",1398810028

GUIs have made computing available to the masses—not just to experts—and that is incredibly important. And touchscreen interfaces have accelerated this advance.<p>> A toddler also can&#x27;t operate a letterpress, solder, or fly a plane. Your point?<p>My point is that you are focused on a very narrow set of use cases (e.g. operating a letterpress, soldering, or flying a plane). For the vast majority of computing tasks, a (possibly touch-based) GUI interface is ideal. Yes, CLIs are better for some things, but those things are a tiny minority.<p>> There are designers who worry about designing for toddlers, but that&#x27;s a very specific niche, not at all representative of the average computer user. Hence my comment was not concerned with designing software interfaces for toddlers. Of course I wouldn&#x27;t advocate using a CLI for an application meant for toddlers.<p>But I take it from this that you WOULD advocate using a CLI for email, social media, shopping, instant messaging, reading a magazine, designing buildings/airplanes/computers, audio recording and production, data visualization, doing your taxes, operating points of sale, etc., etc., etc.<p>(And now I imagine that you will try to convince me that a CLI <i>is</i> actually better for one or more of those things. I am unlikely to believe you.)<p>GUIs are better, not because they are more efficient, but because they are <i>intuitive</i>. People can understand them, so they can actually use them effectively. Being able to use an inefficient tool is vastly better than being unable to use an efficient one. Focusing on intuitiveness has opened up computing to the entire human race, instead of just an elite few.",1398810012

Rather, the goal is to offer a tool that, after a few hours of learning, can be used extremely productively and efficiently for the rest of your life. I have yet to see a single GUI file explorer that offers something that mc couldn&#x27;t (and for that matter, I have yet to see a single GUI file explorer that offers a level of functionality anywhere near mc - for many features in mc, a GUI driven interaction would be detrimental to the tool).<p>Also, one thing to keep in mind when talking about interfaces is that &quot;intuitive&quot; is a very tricky word that doesn&#x27;t necessarily mean what we&#x27;d like to think it means: <a href=""http://www.asktog.com/papers/raskinintuit.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.asktog.com/papers/raskinintuit.html</a><p>---<p>To answer your specific point pertaining to mc:<p>> there&#x27;s no way to interact with the app that might not also issue a command).

And of course, every destructive action asks for user confirmation before being committed.<p>Thoughts like &quot;what does &#x27;RenMov&#x27; mean?&quot; are totally normal (and also occur with GUIs for sure) - but knowing the answer takes you 30 seconds, and then you&#x27;re set for life. Again, when you&#x27;re considering the fact that this is a tool you&#x27;re likely to use for thousands of hours over your life if you commit to it, it makes it a worthy investment. Sure, the OSX Finder doesn&#x27;t take a few hours to understand - but the huge amount of time lost doing things in Finder.app (or explorer.exe or dolphin or nautilus or ...) that can be done in mc much faster pale in comparison to that learning curve.",1398809839

Former architectures, like Sandy/Ivy Bridge, are capable of up to 6 operations per cycle and have a buffer size of 168 micro-ops. At least from that perspective, Apple&#x27;s Cyclone is positioned in between the two Intel microarchitectures.<p>So Apple&#x27;s chip architecture is between Sandy Bridge and Haswell. That&#x27;s not to say that A7 is <i>as fast as SNB</i> chips, because it has roughly half the clock speed of those chips, but it seems to follow my previous prediction that either this year or next year we&#x27;ll see a mobile ARM chip that will be <i>as fast</i> as a SNB &quot;Core&quot; chip (at the time I was predicting it will be Nvidia&#x27;s Denver, but I think Apple&#x27;s A8 will achieve that, too, this year).<p>Then after one more generation (late 2015), we should see mobile ARM CPU&#x27;s rival Haswell/Broadwell in performance, considering how little the IPC has improved for these Intel CPUs since Sandy Bridge (my previous comment on this here: <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7661573"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7661573</a>), while ARM CPUs will continue to have pretty significant gains in performance every year, over the next few years (certainly at least until they reach the FinFET 16nm node).",1398808927

After about 4-6 weeks, Yahoo mail app becomes so slow, that it is no longer possible to even scroll through emails (on Nexus 5). I have to clear Yahoo app&#x27;s data cache, and reconfigure to make it fast again. Perhaps it&#x27;s time to take a look at this: when you have things decaying and breaking like that, it encourages hackers to look extra hard for vulnerabilities, since it&#x27;s a reasonable assumption that other things are neglected, too.\nI should note that Yahoo&#x27;s android mail app is probably the most viable part of the whole Yahoo business now.",1412650791

8419473,comment,8417912,8418620,1,0,deciplex,,,"It&#x27;s a good method for making change, but for doing subtraction in general it is (in my opinion) not so great, the reason being that you have to keep track of more figures in your short term memory, when compared to left-to-right.<p>To do subtraction by counting up you need to remember: the minuend, how far you&#x27;ve already counted up, and the number you&#x27;ve already counted up to. So, three figures. Subtraction left-to-right (or right-to-left) only requires you remember two numbers: what remains of the minuend, and what remains of the subtrahend. It&#x27;s pretty easy even for primary school kids once they practice a bit.<p>Of course, when you&#x27;re making change, you don&#x27;t actually care how far you&#x27;ve counted up, because you&#x27;re not really after the difference exactly, you&#x27;re only trying to arrive at the correct number of coins and bills. So you can forget that part, or rather you can leave it to the coins in your hand to remember for you, and now you&#x27;re back to two numbers. But I&#x27;d bet that if I asked you to tell me on the spot what the difference was <i>without looking at the change in your hand</i> you&#x27;d struggle to tell me.<p>Making change by subtraction left-to-right is cumbersome because, while you still only need to remember two numbers, after you calculate the difference in your head you must now count out the change, whereas with counting up you&#x27;re already done.<p>Different tools for different purposes.

Point is, we tend to seek efficient language for terms we use frequently.<p>You might, once in a while, go to a good restaurant and order a meal in which you specify in excruciating detail what you wish to be served and how you wish it prepared. But most of us, most of the time, are selecting common ingredients and common preparations from a very limited set of options. Being excessively detailed in this context is just a waste of time.<p>Most places that serve burgers offer one option: beef. Ground-up cow or steer. You don&#x27;t even get to choose the cut - the flesh is likely a mix of cuts, blended to a consistent flavor profile and fat content, pre-measured and machine-formed to ensure consistent results and fast preparation. You <i>might</i>, if you go upscale a bit, have the option of a burger made from turkey or buffalo, or perhaps even one that doesn&#x27;t contain meat at all; you&#x27;ll indicate your desire for these with a convenient prefix: &quot;turkey burger&quot;, &quot;buffalo burger&quot;, &quot;walnut burger&quot;, etc. If folks at some point developed a taste for gamey Coloradoan, you might briefly have the option of ordering a &quot;shog9 burger&quot;...<p>...all of these would be <i>shorthand</i> for &quot;ground-up, seasoned patties of [prefix], served on a bun&quot;.<p>At some point, you learned this. Hopefully, you learned it young, from your parents or caregivers, who taught you where the meat came from, how it was prepared, showed you the cost to all involved in transforming a beast of the field into a meal... Hopefully you learned before you&#x27;d built up too many false assumptions about what food <i>is</i>.<p>Many, sad to say, do not - there is a troubling breakdown in our culture that distances folks&#x27; notions of sustenance from the knowledge of the cycles and processes that are prerequisites to sustain life - whether the meal consumed is a burger or a cabbage.<p>And that <i>is</i> truly disgusting.",1412650122

That doesn&#x27;t make me the owner of the land.  Ownership of anything is a social construct, without which the greatest warlord wins.<p>2) Even given the social construct of ownership, the enforcer of the social construct is not the &quot;owner&quot;.  If I pay a private security firm to guard my property, most people don&#x27;t assume I&#x27;ve ceded ownership to them.<p>3) Even given those narrow definitions, the radio spectrum is much more nuanced than physical property.   Radio waves literally travel around the world.  I as a property owner can enact physical boundaries that have a fair chance of preventing trespass and providing an uninformed arbitrator to make a decent decision.

My dad was in the IS department of a medium-sized insurance company, and his department was full of chess players, assembly language programmers, ham radio operators, and computer tinkerers. My dad&#x27;s boss was all of those rolled into one. &quot;You would love it!&quot; my mom told me, &quot;his basement is full of computers!&quot; My imagination ran wild.<p>Within a week or two my dad&#x27;s boss invited us over. We pulled up to his house and I gazed up at a 50-foot tower with a beam antenna next to his garage. As I walked into the basement, I could hear strange sounds of beeping, static, and garbled voice. My first sight was of three walls covered with a custom-built set of cabinets that contained a dizzying array of electronic equipment. I would later learn that it was full of Heathkit radios and computers. I was awe-struck.<p>Later that fall my dad announced, &quot;we&#x27;re getting a computer.&quot; We proceeded to spend several evenings and weekends at my dad&#x27;s boss&#x27; house where they built our family&#x27;s Heathkit H-89 computer. As they soldered, I played on the Heathkit pinball machine. Our H-89, as I recall, had 16K of RAM and a 4 MHz Z-80 CPU. My first program was about twenty print statements that displayed a crude outline of a football helmet using asterisks.<p>That winter I studied for and received my amateur radio novice, and later, my general class license, and my dad&#x27;s boss administered the novice test. I remember him sending morse code at 6 or 7 WPM and excitedly decoding it and reading it back to him. My first radio was a Heathkit purchased for $80 at a ham &#x27;flea market&#x27;. I went on to build a Heathkit VTVM (vacuum tube voltmeter), a code practice oscillator, and a few other kits.

It&#x27;s like trying to get several feet of air by crouching down and hitting the ground with a hammer. The collision is too elastic.</i> //<p>It&#x27;s not at all like hitting the ground with a hammer [but hammers will bounce on concrete FWIW and even flip end over]. It&#x27;s more akin to a see-saw that isn&#x27;t fixed down. If the force at the back of the board is sufficient to overcome the weight of the board pulling it down at the front then the board will rotate lifting the front. Once the back of the board hits the floor there is a new pivot point, the rear tip of the board (<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=339k4XEvbxY#t=4"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=339k...</a>). Now the board is rotating - in the clip - anticlockwise. But the front foot prevents this rotation and provides a further pivot.<p>You can do this experiment to demonstrate that a pivoted plank can jump. Take a ruler, place it on top of a rounded pen - this setup mimicking the rear wheel of a skateboard. Hit the ruler down at the short end and you&#x27;ll see it flip up (it might take some practice!). Indeed the whole ruler, if it&#x27;s short enough, might flip and continue rotating such that the long end goes up and over the short end - but this is because you don&#x27;t have a front foot pushing that part down. Replacing the foot with your hand - as a barrier above the ruler preventing this continued rotation - leads to the ollie being imitated. The ruler jumps up with nothing other than a swift hit on the short end furthest from the pivot.<p><pre><code>                                ( ) hand imitates\n                                ( ) front foot\n                                ( )\n    ( )                         ( )   \n    ( )\n    ( ) hit\n    ( ) down\n    ---------------------------------\n             O\n             pivot, eg pen</code></pre>",1412649012

It&#x27;s not a subculture or a statement, it simply <i>is</i>. One of the things I really despise about hackathons here is how much time they spend wallowing in their own cultural statement. Sponsored by Monster Energy? Check. Important investors as judges? Check. Nerf guns? Yep. Quadcopters flying everywhere? Yeeeep. In the end it feels like 50% creating stuff and 50% reinforcing your place in the Subculture.<p>In the same way the video game subculture is 50% enjoying video games, and 50% self-referential memes about its own subculture-ness.<p>When I first got started in programming it was on obscure forums on the Internet. I didn&#x27;t participate in any &quot;scene&quot; events, I just wrote code, and collaborated with others online who wrote code. We did it for its own sake, not to win competitions or impress judges or hobnob with industry luminaries. We just did.<p>I&#x27;d venture that most of the hacking going on in the world (in the West or the East) is going on in backyards - both virtual and real. It&#x27;s hard to gauge how much is going on precisely because they&#x27;re just hacking and making, not preening their feathers ostentatiously and inventing capital-letter names for their movement.",1412648891

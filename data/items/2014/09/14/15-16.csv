Go to any college campus or most of the internet, and you can hear every concern KSR raises described in much greater nuance and detail, and reasonable attempts at much more convincing solutions thought up.

But its true, breathtaking failure is in stitching together its (bad) political novel with its (rehearsed) science fiction novels, the terrible amalgamation making both components worse due to just how poorly the two sides fit.  The science fiction part makes mockery of the political part -- these political problems simply do not make sense in that world.  The political part drags the book off trap in the science fiction.

(Twitch, Mojang, Oculus)<p>-------------------------<p>a) is not indicative of any long-term acceptance and popularity of &quot;geekdom&quot;. Sci-fi, superhero and fantasy films have fluctuated in popularity on and off over the past 40 years. We&#x27;re simply at another point where they&#x27;ve picked up again. In fact, the article does mention this quite neatly: &quot;In the past, there have been plenty of pop culture phenomena nerds could get behind — the frenzies surrounding the “Star Wars” and “Lord of the Rings” movie franchises are two potent examples.&quot;<p>This is out, then.<p>b) is a technological inevitability. It has nothing to do with a spike in &quot;geekdom&quot;. It&#x27;s just progress, and in fact, one might make an argument that it is, to some extent, a regression. This is due to the locked down and obscurantist nature of consumer electronics, which discourage hacking and where everything is buried under a smoke screen. Social media? The Web is becoming ever more ubiquitous, so of course social media will as well. Social media has become more practical due to advances in web technology.<p>c) is closely related to b). As I stated, it may actually well serve as an argument against proliferation of &quot;geekdom&quot;.<p>d) This means little, again. People have always been passionate about fiction they&#x27;re invested in, so it&#x27;s only normal that they&#x27;ll memorize factoids and trivia. Honestly, if people think the best thing that came out of the Information Age is being able to look up factoids about television shows, what a miserable failure it is then.<p>e) is just tech giants being tech giants. Hurray?<p>-----------------------<p>Finally, I&#x27;d like to state that <i>The Big Bang Theory</i> has a rather... mixed reception, to put it euphemistically. In addition, installing a printer isn&#x27;t always so simple. CUPS is nowhere near as bad as it used to be, but I still find myself having to reset the printer driver for the UI quite frequently, as it just arbitrarily blocks.

As an American, I certainly never felt like I was immune to foreign governments spying on me.</i><p>That&#x27;s mostly due to cold war propaganda, and the tons of movies and shitty shows like 24 that legitimize the notion that small nations (e.g Yugoslavia of yore, or some insignificant arab country) have spies everywhere and perform high-tech James-Bond like operations...<p>Foreign governments never cared/dared to spy on Americans like that. Most don&#x27;t have the means, and even if they did, they have no power to do anything about what they find. And of course it they were caught they&#x27;d have to face the consequences from the 100000-pound global military, diplomatic and economic gorilla. Plus, most world governments are in cushy terms with the US.<p>The worst offender was USSR -- and then again it was insignificant to the level that is going on today, and USSR was a paper-tiger in lots of ways itself. Smaller countries, at worst, try to spy a little on delevelopments involving their country, e.g to spy on some diplomats, large businesses with interest in their area, etc. And that&#x27;s talking about countries like France, Germany etc, not Belize or Albania or whatever.<p>Believing this is like believing the school bully is equally bullied himself from the other children.",1410707020

This one mimics the look-and-feel of the original rather well, but, sadly, I have yet to see a clone that faithfully implements the gameplay of the original.<p>From memory (remember that I was only 6 back then, so I might have screwed up some things):<p>* There were two levels of difficulty, denoted &quot;игра А&quot; and &quot;игра B&quot; (&quot;game A&quot; and &quot;game B&quot;). The A version was easier: in it, the bottom-left roost was disabled and eggs would never fall off of it. In game B, all four roosts were in use.<p>* There were multiple stages of the game:\n- Score 0 to 5: only one egg falling at any given time, the next egg appears only when you catch the previous one\n- Score 6 to 20 (?): two eggs active at any given time\n- Score 21 to 50 (?): three eggs active at any given time<p>And so on, up to a limit of, I think, six or so at a time, at certain thresholds. Also, at certain score thresholds the game speed would accelerate. I think this didn&#x27;t start to be noticeable until the score of 200 or so; by the time you got to score 500 falling eggs would become moderately fast, by score 700 quite fast, and getting past 800 or even 900 would require your fingers to be extremely snappy.<p>* If I remember correctly, getting past 999 would cause the score to wrap back to 0 and the speed to wrap back to as slow as at the start, but you wouldn&#x27;t get three lives back and you would still have six eggs to catch at a time. I managed to do this only a few times ever; I think my high score ever was approximately 1050-1100, and average score might have been around 700-750. This was in game A, which I mostly played.<p>* Also if I remember correctly, the order of falling eggs, at least in the beginning phase of the game, was deterministic (top-left roost, then top-right roost, then bottom-left roost (skipped in version A), then bottom-right roost, and so on). The order of subsequent eggs was probably deterministic as well, but this wasn&#x27;t noticeable anymore. The initial roost might have been chosen randomly.",1410706815

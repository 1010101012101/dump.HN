For context, I&#x27;m from Australia, where helmets are mandatory for all bike riders. Making them non-mandatory is a change that some think will increase cycling uptake.<p>Anyway, if it was to me, then<p>a) I&#x27;m a cyclist (over 6000km and 115,000 vertical meters this year. That&#x27;s further than I drove).<p>b) Of course pedestrians deserve space. I&#x27;d prefer to change the laws to allow non-helmeted riding on separated bike paths only, but that would be useless as where I live most separated bike paths don&#x27;t link up which means people must either ride on the road or (illegally) on the footpath to get between them. In a world where not everywhere is Copenhagen or Amsterdam I&#x27;d prefer to see children ride to school with their parents on footpaths than not ride. I&#x27;d prefer to see people who worry about helmet hair ride to work on footpaths and separated bike paths than not ride. Where I live both these things are currently illegal.<p>c) Yes. Riding on roads needs to be made safe. That does not preclude encouraging more diverse transport choices by making other changes too.<p>I find too many cycling advocates come from entrenched pro or anti-helmet positions and aren&#x27;t prepared to look for compromises.

It is not clear whether they might be working as full-time employees at the “commercial entities,” or whether they are visiting commercial facilities under false pretenses.&quot;</i><p>The author is also picking quotes from different programs and mashing them together to come up with their speculation.  Note how the commercial entities are discussed under the &quot;Sentry Owl&quot; program on page 7, but the &quot;covert or under cover&quot; quote comes from the &quot;Sentry Osprey&quot; section on the last page, which appears to be talking about the NSA working with the CIA.

The quote in the article is in turn a quote from <a href=""http://trb.metapress.com/content/x7854w1160551331/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://trb.metapress.com/content/x7854w1160551331/</a> . The article links to that publication. The abstract of that publication says:<p>> This research investigated the relationship between lane width and safety for roadway segments and intersection approaches on urban and suburban arterials. The research found no general indication that the use of lanes narrower than 3.6 m (12 ft) on urban and suburban arterials increases crash frequencies. This finding suggests that geometric design policies should provide substantial flexibility for use of lane widths narrower than 3.6 m (12 ft). The inconsistent results suggested increased crash frequencies with narrower lanes in three specific design situations. Narrower lanes should be used cautiously in these three situations unless local experience indicates otherwise.<p>It it turn builds on, for example, results by Hauer, et al, Strathman et al. which appear.<p>You then raised another objection, which is, I believe, that a 10&#x27; lane causes people to use alternate routes because of decreased capacity on those lanes, so there are simply fewer people on the 10&#x27; lane roads to cause accidents.<p>This may well be. It&#x27;s a subtle network effect that is hard to analyze, and not covered in this article. (The article does comment that capacity is unchanged, but I think its literature citations are weak. It quotes Petritsch who in turn quotes a summary of an unpublished literature search.)<p>However, your objection is not what was refutated. AnthonyMouse proposes that narrowing lanes lead to a higher accident rate since it &quot;reduces the amount of space available to avoid an obstruction, the amount of reaction time available to avoid a collision, etc.&quot; While true for country roads, those above papers show that the same correlation can not be identified on city roads.<p>Now, what I know is only from this article, and it may be that the author cherry-picked the few papers which show that the &#x27;reaction time&#x27; hypothesis is unsupported by the evidence. But &quot;refute&quot; means &quot;to deny the accuracy or truth of&quot;, and certainly the article refuted that hypothesis.",1413027782

The brain is floating in liquid - the cerebrospinal fluid. To take another example, drop a ping pong ball into a glass of water. Now try to move fast without the ball hitting the side of the glass.

Even something as intense as the &quot;cold war&quot;, had the qualifier <i>cold</i> in it, because there was no open confrontation.

It&#x27;s not a war if I steal your trade secrets and undermine your negotiation positions in international treaties.<p>If you frame it as a &quot;war&quot; you get a whole different solution space.

People slowed down at first, but now people go just as fast as they used to, typically 5-10MPH over the speed limit, and some 15 MPH over (that&#x27;s 50MPH). The radar signs installed as part of the project always read 40, 42, 45 and not just for my car.<p>As a cyclist, the bike lanes don&#x27;t really make me feel safer. There is a good margin of space between the bike lane and the car lane, but the bike lanes are really only in effect for half of any given block. The second half of the block, the line between the car/bike lanes is dotted, and cars can legally enter the bike lane, to make right turns. And then of course, anyone parallel parking on the street has to cross the bike lane to do so.<p>Making the lanes narrower did not make pedestrian crossings any safer, as the road is actually the same width, and you still have to travel the same distance to cross the street. What did make it safer for pedestrians, the installation of flashing yellow warning lights at certain crosswalks, that pedestrians can turn on before crossing the street. Motorists see them and stop for people crossing, and that is a new and welcome effect.<p>The bike lanes would have been much MUCH better implemented one block south of the main drag on a residential street that runs parallel. Much safer for cyclists. Healthier too, not having to breath as much vehicle exhaust. And probably a more optimal allocation of resources for the citizens. As much as everyone wants to be PC and become friendly advocates of human-powered transport, it really doesn&#x27;t make sense in this part of town, to increase trip times and emissions for thousands of motorists daily, so the 50 people who choose to ride their bike can have a marginally safer lane to ride in. In Downtown L.A., it is completely different. Downtown, the bike lanes make sense because hundreds if not thousands of people use them. You always see a bike in the bike lane over there. But outside of the heart of the city, many people commute to work and carpool their kids to school and ballet and such. They&#x27;re not going to ride bikes 5 hours a day to make that kind of commute.<p>Oh, and where the traffic engineers failed to account for, and accommodate heavy traffic on a couple of heavily-traveled segments of the road, motorists now drive their cars illegally in the bike lanes during periods of congestion.<p>IMO the project is mostly a failure. The safer pedestrian crossings are a great improvement. But the bike lanes such as they are, and the narrower lanes, just a waste of money. Putting the bike lanes on a side street would have been really great, a win-win for both cyclists and motorists.",1413025249

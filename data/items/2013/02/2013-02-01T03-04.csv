I've spoken to a few customers who have ""cheat sheets"" of Erlang console commands they use to debug things like handoff slowness or poor performance in general. This alone means we need to do better,<p>On the other hand, Riak continues to function in scenarios where other databases would be completely unavailable.  I'll take immature visibility during those situations over complete unavailability any day,<p>I appreciate your feedback - I can assure you that this is something we're constantly working on and you'll see improvements with each release.<p>Finally, if you've been bitten by anything specific you'd like to see fixed, we do all our development in the open at <a href=""http://github.com/basho"" rel=""nofollow"">http://github.com/basho</a>, so github issues, pull requests, etc go right into our internal tools and workflows.<p>Cheers,<p>Andy Gross",1359691198

It is really hard for people, especially developers, to let go of their personal space. I know it was for me during the transition.<p>Working on many different teams in numerous cities over the last few years, the bullpen and shared space is one of the best ways to remove silos and promote organic conversation (kill meetings). Pairing instead of code reviews (or gated checkins), talking instead of team meetings, one on ones instead of political games and going out for coffee to think through a hard problem. With the right team, you show up at 9am and leave work at 10am (really it is 5pm, but it feels like 10am).",1359691043

5149120,comment,5146508,5148141,4,0,kunle,,,"> In addition, I wonder by what criteria one would evaluate how ""properly"" the markets are functioning. Who decides what is proper? For example, based on the business fundamentals it seems ludicrous to me that Apple would have a lower P/E ratio than GM--but it currently does.<p>Couple of things:<p>1. Reference to Apple PE ratio is likely a market driven phenomenon that has occurred before to the other technology company that grew very large very fast (MSFT) ie. sometime around 2000, most mutual/institutional investment funds literally owned more of MSFT (and now they likely do of AAPL) than they were legally allowed to own. At this cap, given that these buyers are the largest ""long term"" drivers of a stock's directionality, the stock must change direction. The second part of this effect is that now a bunch of them are underwater, and the psychology of holding a bad trade will affect whether they decide to book the loss (likely they wont for a while). TLDR: Apple is simply too large, relative to the tech sector, for its stock price growth to match its business fundamentals.<p>2. Re: markets functioning properly - we should remember that the ""markets"" are literally a construct. For all the logical arguments made about how HFT reduce the bid/offer spreads, I'm philosophically opposed to them. Mark Cuban has articulated why better than I can: <a href=""http://blogmaverick.com/2010/05/09/what-business-is-wall-street-in/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blogmaverick.com/2010/05/09/what-business-is-wall-str...</a><p>In a nutshell, if we constructed the markets fundamentally to make it easier for businesses in the real economy to raise and price capital, and HFT starts to account for a multiple of that, then the purpose of the ""market"" construct has been hijacked.<p>This leads to all sorts of gnarly questions about how to decide what the right volume is etc, so I recognize its'a thorny area - just pointing out that HFT is not so benign, and oftentime comes with consequences that far outweigh the benefit, and happen too often to ignore.",1359691006

5149118,comment,5145397,5148276,2,0,jrochkind1,,,"The YAML vulnerability was not from any 'eval' in the YAML library itself, you realize, right?<p>It was from allowing de-serialization to arbitrary classes, when it turned out that some classes had dangerous side-effects merely from instantiation -- including in some cases, 'eval' behavior, yes, but the eval behavior wasn't in YAML, it was in other classes, where it could be triggered by instantiation.<p>To use your language, I don't think it's 'intellectual honest' to call allowing de-serialization to data-specified classes ""a YAML parser that executed code""--that's being misleading -- or to say that a 'trained monkey should have known it was a bad idea' (allowing de-serialization to arbitrary data-specified classes).<p>There have been multiple vulnerabilities _just like this_ in other environments, including several in Java (and in major popular Java packages).  You could say with all that prior art it ought to have been obvious, but of course you could say that for each of the multiple prior vulnerabilities too.

You get intimate knowledge of C++, compilers, assembly and other close-to-the-metal aspects of programming. I wonder how much time it is going to take; the very simple compiler I had to write in college using yacc/Bison, supplied boilerplating and a trivial output format already took several days of full-time work. Full C++-compliance seems like a _huge_ project.<p>The website is missing some information however: who's behind it? It says:<p><pre><code>  The CPPGM Foundation was formed by a software company that
  recognized the value to programmer productivity that a good
  knowledge of language mechanics had to new developers to
  their team.  The C++ Grandmaster Certification began
  development as an internal training program, and the
  foundation was founded to offer it publicly.
</code></pre>
but fails to mention what that company is. Additionally, the domain is registered anonymously...<p>Edit:
After some digging, it seems that the only information available on the people behind this is the fact that they emailed the press release to the comp.lang.c++ newsgroup from a residential IP-address in Switzerland. (NNTP-Posting-Host header)",1359690812

5149110,comment,5146870,5146870,8,0,rjett,,,"While this article was noncommittal in offering up the reasons for HB's success, the pleasant sales experience was reiterated throughout the article. THIS IS HUGE IN RETAIL.<p>As of this coming Saturday, I'll be a year into operating a coffee shop I opened with two friends. Like HB, my shop has exceeded my expectations in the first year. FWIW, here are my observations on success:
If you have the best sales experience in town coupled with a great, consistent product, people will talk about you. I monitor every mention of keywords related to our shop on twitter, Facebook, yelp, instagram, tumblr, etc and after a year in operation, it's pretty clear that people value the attitude [or lack thereof] of my employees, our approachability, the quality and consistency of our product, and the beauty of our shop. In combination, these things help create and maintain a lot of positive buzz about the shop. Buzz begets buzz too. We've never once paid for advertising and instead let word of mouth and good product do the talking. First there were just tweets, Facebook mentions, and word of mouth. Then bloggers started writing about us. Then we had local press do a few stories on us. With time, all this turned into positive reputation and people outside of the city began to mention us. Recently we've received national press. We also just climbed atop the #1 ranking in yelp for coffee in Charleston, SC. Over the past year, I've made a concerted effort to keep people talking and it seems to have worked.<p>TLDR: If people see integrity in the ownership, quality in the product, and a pleasant sales environment, they will tell someone and they will be loyal to the brand. If you've done your job so well that you can inspire your customers to talk about you, you will grow, even if you aren't in a prime location.",1359690792

You sell your stuff to us, get paid instantly, and buy whatever you want right away.<p>As for the remaining balance goes. New products come out all the time and more often that not, you will purchase a new product in the future, right?

I think they wanted to spend more time on the product as a whole so that they could show the world what the vision was, then come back and polish it a bit.<p>So many products get launched with gadgets, buttons, options, but they miss the mark on a larger scale, the product itself.<p>Personally I haven't used it (no real need), so I don't know what exactly it's lacking. A change password option does seem like a crucial thing to have (although I think that I read somewhere that your password is part of the key, and if that changed you'd lose access to everything that was encrypted...

My understanding of the academic stuff is mostly intuitive. It isn't until I read a paper like Monadic Parser Combinators [1] or sigfpe's blog [2] that it really becomes concrete.<p>I find that for a lot of higher-level ideas much of the heavy lifting isn't necessarily through application of functional ideas per se, but through more sophisticated type gymnastics.<p>Because expressions are often written in short-hand (to expose structure), as well abbreviated and underspecified (to get the compiler to do the work), making sense of academic code can be a challenge.<p>In another life I'd have dedicated more time to learning the fundamentals (of Programming Language Theory and Category Theory), because I find the whole field insanely facinating.

The second one would almost always be impossible to show simply because of the recency and rate of change of the industry as a whole: How do you show ""long"" anything when the market segment has only existed for five years? Likewise failure of others; most of the problems haven't even existed long enough for anyone to have seriously tried and failed to solve them.<p>And then commercial success goes the other way. Because software is so complicated, it infringes a zillion patents by accident, so is all you need to show commercial success that Android or iOS is allegedly infringing and you're done because they're commercially successful? Or do you have to show that the patent was the main cause of the success, which will then go back to almost never being the case?<p>I suppose setting a nearly impossible standard that would result in a de facto abolition of software patents is one way to fix it, but I would much prefer just actually abolishing them. The alternative is to give the Federal Circuit yet another opportunity to read language broadly and expand the scope of patentability beyond what is reasonable.",1359687793

My current belief is that the probability of races and deadlocks occurring is a function of the amount of shared data and that conventional shared-everything threading implementations make this far more common than it ought to be.  In its extremus this points to a distribution-capable asynchronous message passing architecture á la Erlang, or at least something like Hoare's CSP.<p>The related criticism that there's too much mutable data is correct in many ways, but can also be seen as a way of reducing the ""data frontier""; if it's immutable then there are no concurrency implications.<p>Now, that said, transactional models don't fit well into that mental model.

829350,comment,829218,829314,0,0,gchpaco,,,"The chief problem with this is that most programmers' intuitions are calibrated for single threaded processes; when they think of ""what could happen"" race conditions and deadlocks aren't there.  This, I think, is because they are usually emergent global properties, not localized errors, and we're not used to looking for those or, frankly, especially good at them.<p>There's a very simple way to prevent all deadlocks and race conditions.  It's called in some circles the ""Global Interpreter Lock"" which converts the system from concurrent to single threaded, and is usually the wrong way to deal with the problem.  These locks become performance hurdles over time, and people try to replace them with finer grained locks, and what happens <i>every time</i> is that mysterious and weird concurrency errors happen, sometimes for years, until things finally get ironed out.  Happens in Python, Linux kernel, and probably a million other places I'm not immediately familiar with.",1253234026

I get that the 37S visual style could be seen as ""not doing any graphic design"" and I assume this is meant in an at least partially facetious way, so don't worry, I get the joke and the serious point contained within it. I am however happy to stand up and say that I am one of those who likes the bare visual style that 37S pioneered.<p>But none the less, skipping the non-functional mock-up stage does not make so much sense for your average (say, freelance) web designer/developer who is directly servicing multiple clients, each of whom expects a completely different visual style for their website. I remember following a link (somehow connected to this 37S post, maybe in the comments or something) to this post:<p><a href=""http://www.pixelhavenllc.com/weblog/designers-who-skip-photoshop/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.pixelhavenllc.com/weblog/designers-who-skip-photo...</a><p>And thinking that sums it up pretty well for me.<p>As often seems to be the case, some people think that what 37S says works for them should invariably work for everyone else without modification and if it doesn't, then that somehow invalidates any value that their advice may have had. o_0",1253233973

Firstly, the rendering itself. I do it via using the GPU to render textured quads, to get trilinear filtering without a big load on the CPU. Without this filtering, the quality goes out the window: standard font rendering algorithms don't render fonts nicely at tiny sized.<p>The other issue is performance: consider a large file, and just scrubbing up and down with the scroll bar. With the minimap, you have to be able to render thousands of lines of text efficiently, to keep scrolling smooth. I built the rendering structure around this requirement, and I suspect without a lot of attention, typical text rendering code wouldn't be able to layout and draw the text fast enough.

There are quite a few things which can go wrong when we have several agents working on shared data, primarily<p>Deadlocks\nRace conditions</i><p>A bit off-topic, but I see statements like this all the time, and I always wonder:  why is it assumed that you're going to throw together an aggressive design that shoots for theoretically optimally performance, and then trying to ferret out the bugs?  Ideally, the solution will be both correct and optimally performant, but if you're worried that you aren't going to get it right, you should start thinking about the best way to fail.  It seems wiser to start with a simple dumb solution you know is correct and work carefully towards a more complex, better-performing solution.  In that case you would list ""crappy performance"" as the primary thing that can go wrong in a concurrent system -- but nobody ever does.  They're worried about bugs.  That means that when they're done with their first attempt, they'll be confident in its performance but not in its correctness.<p>Here's why I think it's better to start with a simple dumb solution and work from there:  you can stop short of an ideal solution.  Maybe you only have to optimize it well enough so that it isn't the scaling bottleneck.  Or maybe you can just deploy it and tolerate the performance limitations.  If you start with code that has the optimal performance characterists but isn't <i>correct</i>, you can't deploy it until you fix all the bugs.  You've committed yourself to creating an ideal solution, even though an ideal solution might not be necessary.",1253232575

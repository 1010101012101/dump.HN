FWIW, we used to ride on top of elevators (and sometimes their counterweights) at RPI in the 1970s and call it hacking. So, yes, I can relate to the article, man, whether or not hacking goes back to the 1920s or the Renaissance or ancient Greece.",1235299440

490518,comment,490366,490454,0,0,icefox,,,"My favorite thing about browsers is that they sniff content that is sent to them to see what it is.  For several different cases such as when the web server does not sent the content type or to see if what was sent is probably a gif or javascript or maybe xml even if you say it is something else.  The amount of sniffing and guessing is really amazing.  The spec requires you must specify a content type.  Guessing what a file is just seems like a world of hurt and pain in the long run.",1235298632

Traditionally the CPM revenue has been fine with these and more than paid the bills - in January it just dropped off into hell.  The cause is that advertisers have slashed their budget and are no longer shelling out for CPM ads.",1235297968

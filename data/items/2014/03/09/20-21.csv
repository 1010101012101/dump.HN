Yes, adopting new technology increases some risks, but also decreases others. The good thing is that usually you can have both systems on at the same time. If the internet connection and GPS fails, it&#x27;s not difficult to fall back to the existing technology.",1394398762

7369943,comment,7368573,7369913,18,0,mikeash,,,"I doubt rail will replace cross-country flights, but there is a <i>ton</i> of air traffic on shorter routes.<p>As one example where it&#x27;s already done, the DC-NYC Amtrak route is quite popular, despite being just as expensive, if not more so, as the plane ride. It takes a similar amount of time, factoring in travel to and from airports, waiting, etc. and is much nicer. There are still a ton of airline flights between these two cities as well, of course, and those could probably be supplanted to a large degree with additional improvements.<p>That&#x27;s with current American trains, which are painfully slow. Imagine modern high-speed rail between, for example, DC and Miami. It&#x27;s a bit over 1,000 miles which would take about five hours. That would be an excellent substitute for the plane trip, which is about two hours in the air, but tons of time and hassle at the airports. I have family in South Florida and if such a train existed at something like a reasonable price, I&#x27;d definitely go for it. As it is, Amtrak on that route takes nearly 24 hours and costs way more than an airline ticket. I don&#x27;t see why they get any passengers at all, given that.<p>Seems like 1,000 miles is about the limit for high-speed trains. How many pairs of large American cities are less than 1,000 miles apart and have lots of travel between them? I would bet there are quite a number. Rail doesn&#x27;t have to solve <i>everything</i> to solve a bunch of things.",1394398505

Amtrak tends to be the subject of a lot of stupid politics, with the routes and stops determined more by what wins votes than what makes sense. As a result, a lot of Amtrak routes stop extremely frequently in pretty small towns.<p>As an example, the Amtrak train that runs between Washington DC and Boston (serving NYC along the way, and continuing on to Norfolk, VA) stops not only at DC&#x27;s main train station, but also at New Carrollton, MD and Alexandria, VA, which are not only quite close to DC, but actually on the DC Metro system, making these stops almost completely redundant.<p>I count no less than <i>thirty two</i> stops between Boston and DC. The trip is about 9.5 hours long, so that&#x27;s an average of one stop every 18 minutes.<p>The NYC->Chicago trip isn&#x27;t quite as bad, but still has 19 stops in between. Along the way, it stops in such bustling metropolises as Elkhart, IN (population 51,152) and Sandusky, OH (population 25,493).",1394398092

Independent claims are the most important; dependent claims are only valid if the claims that they depend upon are also valid. Here, claim 1, which is independent, involves a lot of language having to do with digital goods and inventory. Already that&#x27;s confusing because digital goods don&#x27;t tend to have inventory; they&#x27;re digital. Claim 2, which is dependent upon claim 1, gets into digital currencies. The other focus of the patent application relates to combinations of digital goods. I&#x27;d expect the examiner to push back on claim 1 to clarify what they&#x27;re actually talking about and limit it accordingly.<p>Is there a lot of prior art out there dated before December 29, 2011 (the application&#x27;s priority date) that could block this applciation from ever going anywhere? Yeah, there is. Will I file some with the USPTO in a few minutes? Yeah, I will.<p>Meanwhile, keep in mind, patents are inherently confusing because by the time one gets granted it has three numbers already, and that&#x27;s just in the U.S.: there&#x27;s the application number, which here is 13/340,494, the publication number (before publication, no one can see the application so it can&#x27;t yet be considered prior art in others), which here is US20130173416 A1, and the grant or issue number, which right now would be somewhere in the 8 million range were it to be granted. A lot of people and institutions mix these numbers up, including even Westlaw, which calls publications &quot;applications&quot;. A publication is a snapshot of an application at a particular point in time.<p>Anyway, don&#x27;t freak out. There&#x27;s worse [actually granted] patents out there.

You want to implement X, and gee-whiz do I have some cool, new technology that makes it easy!!<p>Okay. Let&#x27;s start. If we make mistakes people die, and careers end. I&#x27;ll let you draw your own conclusions about motivations re that, but all I&#x27;ll say is as an engineer I only ever focused on the former. So, huge testing and verification effort to show that my gee-whiz technology that works in some consumer device has acceptably low failure modes, does not negatively affect pilot work flow, can work under the conditions of flight (-55C to 70C anyone?), over the wide performance characteristics (high G, high vibration, salt water, high radiation), and so on.<p>Okay, you did all that! Let&#x27;s start bolting it on the planes!<p>No.<p>Let&#x27;s write and get approved training programs for all the maintenance workers. Then, let&#x27;s train them - across the whole world. Let&#x27;s write and get approved training programs for the pilot. We will fit it into their refresher training, have new mandated training, or what? Basically, rewrite all the training curriculum that is out there. Get it into the schools, so the pilots coming fresh out of school aren&#x27;t behind. Again, across the world.<p>Oh, this interfaces with the towers? Okay, so do all that again with the towers. Hmm, you want this 2013 technology to seamlessly integrate with some core memory technology - that should be easy. Perform a study, put out RFQs, get bids, select the best bidder, have them build the system, manage them through the cost overrun, opps, 3 months before deployment Congress mandates that that core-memory system be retired, and oh, how will this work in the 168 other countries?<p>Got that sorted. No, wait, no one in the tower knows how to use it, no one knows how to install it, no one knows how to maintain it. Let&#x27;s throw money and time at that! Oh, unions. I hate unions. ATCs have a union. This could take awhile....<p>Finally, it is 2020, and I am rolling out, um, 7 year old technology that is entirely obsolete and no longer supported by the manufacturers. Oh, they&#x27;ll support it if you throw enough money at it - get your $5 microprocessor at $1000 a pop.<p>Meanwhile, the entire world is <i>filled</i> with aircraft still using the old system. So, we mandate a phase-out by 2035. Just another 15 years of supporting the old and new systems in parallel. I&#x27;m sure that&#x27;ll be pretty cheap.<p>People who work in the field will rightly accuse me of hand waving, and especially of over-exaggerating some difficulties (not every modernization project hits every possible snag that exists). But this is still a useful sketch the scope of the problem. I&#x27;ve spent time talking to very high people in the FAA. They are not unaware of the old systems and their limitations, nor are they bumbling bureaucrats (pet peeve - it is easy to villanize faceless people, and that is very lazy thinking).  We in industry are forever proposing new ideas, better technology, and so on (let&#x27;s face it, they are all trying to feed at the trough of government spending, and getting your system mandated is a company maker). But the price tag for my handy,dandy system is at the noise level compared to the cost of the logistics of deployment.<p>I am not arguing that there is nothing to be done, or that everyone is working maximally efficiently right now. Certainly the US is behind other countries in some areas of aviation technology. But it is not in any way a trivial problem, one of &quot;just bolt a new radio to the plane and trash the old ecosystem&quot;.<p>edit: consider, for example, the Rockwell Collins DTU-7000 Data Transfer Module (<a href=""https://www.rockwellcollins.com/sitecore/content/Data/Products/Computing/Storage_Solutions/DTU-7000_Data_Transfer_Unit.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.rockwellcollins.com/sitecore/content/Data/Produc...</a>). This is absolutely modern hardware in the aviation world. It is PCMCIA. And how exciting it was to get. You would not believe the cost and size of the old system - we would jealously keep tracking logs of, I forget, a few MB of flash memory units that cost thousands and thousands (and thousands) of dollars.  There is some even more modern stuff being rolled out that uses usb. But consider, when this is something that contains your flight plan, your maps, and so on, the cost of a stray gamma ray blowing away a byte. Mull on how much testing this hardware goes through. And then factor in all of the logistics above. We already don&#x27;t have money to own the old system, and now I have to go to all this further expense, to save what is truly chump change (that thousands and thousands and thousands number) in the end? Millions to save thousands.<p>Of course, we have to modernize, we can&#x27;t store rich maps on tiny memory, so we spend, and spend, and spend. And then get a front page HN story about how old everything is! Well, there&#x27;s a reason for that.",1394395433

7369743,comment,7367438,7369264,1,0,yetanotherphd,,,"On my motivations, society does allow bullying to happen, and the discrepancy between what it allows to happen to children in the context of bullying, and what it allows in most other cases, requires an explanation.<p>This requires putting oneself in the shoes of the people responsible for this situation, including people who minimize the importance or harm of bullying, people who justify it outright, and people who silently ignore the issue.<p>In doing so I am going to argue that given certain assumptions (both positive and normative), bullying should be permitted or justified.  That is the inevitable outcome of being intellectually honest.<p>You claim there is a difference between upholding social value through reprimand, and bullying.  I couldn&#x27;t tell if being &quot;taught a lesson&quot; referred to violence so I won&#x27;t assume either way.  If it didn&#x27;t refer to violence, then in an individualistic society like ours, people could just ignore it.  Maybe in Scandinavia a verbal reprimand is enough, but not in the rest of Europe or the English speaking world.<p>And yet a free for all of violence would not work either (which seems to be the straw man of bullying you are using in your argument).  Bullying is not only violence and the establishment of a pecking order, and also not only punishing violators of the social code.  Rather it is doing these things together in a complementary way.  The social code is respected because it comes from the most dominant people, and the violence is justified because it also helps cement the social code.<p>This explains why schools and prisons punish people who defend themselves against bullies more than the bullies themselves.  To defend yourself is <i>anti-social</i> violence.  Furthermore, as students get older, this social order morphs into the actual social order of the adult world.  It is not only a pecking order that teachers tolerate because it makes the school easier to manage.  It also gains the gloss of society&#x27;s actual moral code.<p>For example, students might be bullied because they exhibit middle class speech and behavior, and are unwilling or unable to adopt &quot;cool&quot; working class behavior.  A teacher might be sympathetic, but also consider that without this kind of bullying, middle class student could be as snooty as they liked, and that forcing middle class students to respect working class students (even out of fear) would help societal cohesion in the bigger picture.<p>The values that bullies enforce are arbitrary, but not entirely arbitrary.  If they only punished the truly snooty, or the truly degenerate, would progressives or conservatives respectively complain?  I see many people encouraging bullying tech workers in SF because they claim those workers really don&#x27;t respect the values of the communities they live in.  And (this was a while ago) I read a Time magazine article about the bullying of the Columbine shooters, which claimed precisely that their bullying was justified because they violated social norms (as the article said quoting a footballer &quot;they were a bunch of fxxxxts&quot;, and this was in the 1990&#x27;s so the implication wasn&#x27;t that the footballer was in the wrong!).<p>I am not saying that society will fall apart without bullying, but that people who want to maintain social norms that aren&#x27;t enforced by law, logically have little choice but to accept that experiencing an environment with bullying is an imperfect but necessary precursor to knowing your place in society.",1394395227

7498562,comment,7498198,7498198,17,0,nbouscal,,,"I&#x27;ve always disliked the notion that Lisp or Haskell are only worth learning because of some revelation they give you which makes you more productive when you inevitably return to a mainstream language. Yes, there are some good insights that both languages give you, but the real argument for using them is that you can be more productive <i>in those languages</i>, and that it is reasonable to use them in a production environment for that reason. I don&#x27;t think the &quot;return to mainstream languages&quot; is inevitable at all, and I am very happily using Haskell in production at my current job.<p>With that out of the way, what are the benefits? There are quite a few. The following is not a complete list, but I&#x27;ll try to hit the main points.<p>First, type safety. This is the primary argument for Haskell over something like Common Lisp or Clojure, and it is hands-down the strongest reason I choose to use Haskell. I used to hate static typing, because I thought static typing meant writing a bunch of boilerplate that didn&#x27;t really get you anything and frequently got in your way. In Haskell this is not at all the case. As it turns out, type systems have improved dramatically over the past decades. In Haskell we have inference, so no boilerplate, and we have incredibly powerful facilities for polymorphism, so the type system provides real benefits. Being able to derive instances of type classes actually drastically <i>decreases</i> the amount of necessary boilerplate, even compared to dynamic languages. There&#x27;s a common saying in the Haskell community that if it compiles, it probably does what you want it to. This has been my experience, and it is incredibly pleasant.<p>Second, rigorous isolation of side effects. Countless programmers have independently realized how good this is over the course of their careers. Haskell enforces it. Knowing that a given pure function can&#x27;t possibly break something in another distant part of the application is wonderful, and completely prevents entire classes of bugs.<p>Third, the community. Haskell&#x27;s community is often made fun of as being overly academic or too distant from the realities of programming, but in my experience the community&#x27;s love of abstract mathematics is a massive benefit. One easy example is Edward Kmett&#x27;s lens library. It is unabashedly abstract in its origins, and parts of it are still a little over my head. Despite that, it is perfectly usable without knowing the math behind it, and it is actually <i>extremely useful</i> in day-to-day programming. Things like functors, monoids, and monads are often poked fun at, but they are just way too useful for me to care. In this sense, the community is a huge asset, because people keep churning out these useful tools that you just won&#x27;t see in other languages.<p>Fourth, conciseness really is power. I often find myself writing one liners that would require a dozen or more lines in the other languages I&#x27;ve worked in. This frees me up to focus on the business logic, which is what actually matters.<p>Parallelism is also a huge selling point, but I&#x27;ll let someone else cover that because I don&#x27;t have a ton of on-the-ground experience with it.<p>Honestly, when I have to sum up in one sentence why I love using Haskell, it&#x27;s because it makes my job easier. At the end of the day, it&#x27;s really that simple.",1396223973

7498560,comment,7498198,7498198,4,0,simplify,,,"Short version: Most, if not all programming bugs are due to your code receiving something it did not expect. Haskell&#x27;s type system helps eliminate this problem by forcing your code to declare exactly what it expects, and to handle all cases of said expectations.<p>In other words, it&#x27;s doesn&#x27;t let you skip out by not thinking about the entirety of your code. It&#x27;s the same line of benefits that TDD gives you, but TDD is, IMO, a stepping stone towards the pure, functional programming that Haskell provides.<p>Note that I am by no means a Haskell programmer. To me, Haskell is the &quot;last level&quot; in learning development. I hope to one day reach such a level.",1396223948

It reminds me a lot of the hate I see for pop stars on the internet. The vitriol over the Biebers and One Directions simply because they&#x27;re popular in the mainstream. My immediate reaction is &quot;Lots of people like something you don&#x27;t like. Get over it.&quot; But ultimately, it&#x27;s a completely elitist attitude that in this case ignores the cultural basis for sports fandom. He looks at all the ape-like sports fans and wonders why they can&#x27;t behave like civilized men. Like him.<p>In summary:<p>- He doesn&#x27;t like watching sports.<p>- He once heard about a guy who abused his girlfriend and was also a sports fan. He concludes that jerks will be jerks despite the existence of sports and the anecdote was essentially unrelated.<p>- He&#x27;s felt the same shared joy and admiration except about things other than sports and gets why that was exciting but doesn&#x27;t feel the same way about sports.<p>Great. Particularly ill-conceived is this notion that we are being &quot;tricked&quot; into rooting for our regional teams despite their being full of non-local players. What he doesn&#x27;t get is <i>the team is the fans, not the players</i>. We are the constant throughout the team&#x27;s history. As the customer base, we are the reason for the existence of the team. In a sense, we pay to fund the thing. Players may come and go, but without us there would be no team. That&#x27;s why we might simultaneously cheer for a hockey team full Canadians and a baseball team full of Dominicans. No one is &quot;duping&quot; us. I also fail to see the point of the wrestling analogy but I suppose it all goes back to the idea that we&#x27;re all rubes.<p>Of course he has a friend who is an Eagles fan, so it couldn&#x27;t be that he doesn&#x27;t understand the cultural basis. And he likes to watch soccer sometimes so it couldn&#x27;t possibly be that he &quot;just doesn&#x27;t get it&quot;. And he&#x27;s not judging sports fans because they don&#x27;t choose what is enjoyable to them-- <i></i>But why sports?!<i></i><p>I&#x27;ve had so many positive sports-related experiences, memories celebrating with family and friends, countless strangers befriended simply because we were both fans, it&#x27;s no wonder for me. Why does it have to be sports? Because we like them. Why do you struggle to change society instead of accepting that this aspect of the mainstream isn&#x27;t for you?",1396223737

Python&#x27;s typing is insufficient for this.<p>* Qualitatively, writing Python feels like writing instructions for computing something, and writing Haskell feels like simply describing what something <i>is</i>, and the system works out how to compute it for you.  It often feels compelling and magical.<p>Lastly, some tone stuff:  Function pointers have nothing to do with functional programming.  And why hate on a language you haven&#x27;t studied?

The second is the &quot;couchsurfing for money&quot;, people who really are renting out a spare couch or spare bedroom. These are also often illegal, but at least if they do it less often than &quot;always&quot;, and fairly discreetly, are much less likely to run into trouble than the person running a full-fledged flophouse operation. The third category are people running fully licensed vacation rentals.

I rented a house in Crete in this category last year; it was a place that otherwise you could rent directly or via a travel agency, but I only found it via AirBnB because their internet presence apart from AirBnB was poor.

7498459,comment,7496968,7497755,43,0,icambron,,,"I think there&#x27;s some confusion about the analogy being drawn here. Biological classification is, like you said, a question of shared implementations. That&#x27;s useful and it works especially well in biology because organisms are largely built through specialization; i.e. it really <i>is</i> a tree, where ancestry groups organisms by shared genetic material.<p>But to begin with, we&#x27;re not classifying things; we&#x27;re building them. Software is <i>designed</i>; you don&#x27;t (or at least shouldn&#x27;t), construct your programming abstractions by progressively mutating the different parts of your code. Nature had to reimplement flying for the bat, but you don&#x27;t have to! You get to build a bat by strapping wings onto a rat, and you know how to build wings because you already did it for birds. But the hierarchy system doesn&#x27;t let you do that; you&#x27;ll have to do what nature did and completely reimplement flying for the Rodent subclass of Mammal, since Bird is nowhere near it in your hierarchy diagram. That&#x27;s the essence of the author&#x27;s point, as I read it.<p>I suspect Raganwald would probably go a lot further than an OOP+mixin approach (and there is no shortage of good alternatives), but the simplest way around this kind of thing is something like this piece of Ruby:<p><pre><code>  class Bat\n    include Flying\n    include Rodent\n    include Echolocation\n  end\n</code></pre>\nYou get the idea, and it&#x27;s pretty easy to port to JS. It also lets you build the griffin and the centaur, because the software doesn&#x27;t have to follow nature&#x27;s rules about how to derive one thing for another. Constraining your code&#x27;s structure to evolution&#x27;s is-a model is a straight jacket.<p>So that&#x27;s implementation, but what about interface? We actually do care about outward behavior, and making our interfaces reflect that is important. Morphological classification may not tell you much about how a bat works inside and what other species a bat is evolutionarily close to, but it remains the case that if you want to know what a bat <i>does</i>, flying is a big part of that. What if I want to know whether a given animal can get over my fence? How do I ask if a creature can fly? I don&#x27;t care at all that bats are closely related to mice because they&#x27;re acting nothing like mice when zooming over my fence. Do I really add canFly() to some Animal superclass and have flying creatures override it? How many features will I detect that way? But with our mixins, we can just ask if it includes Flying, because the structure of our code captures that. Codifying the structure of your interface into the structure of your classes is part of the point of OOP, but it turns out that interfaces don&#x27;t fit a simple inheritance mold. So you need more powerful tools to describe that structure.<p>This issue comes up enough in gaming that the no-hierarchy-lots-of-mixins approach has a name: the entity-component model. I bring this up not because I think the point applies differently to games but because it&#x27;s a domain where you might actually build a bat.<p>Finally, how far would we really be willing to take biology&#x27;s classification-by-implementation philosophy, even if classifying pieces of code were really our goal? We could end up with superclasses like UsesAStar and HashSet. Not really the point of all of this, right?<p>Long story short: I agree with the article and think the biology doesn&#x27;t contradict it, but think we should probably stop using evolution as a conceptual model for how we organize our code.",1396222456

By computing and comparing hashes they can simply just store one copy of the file and point all users to that single instance of the file (they may do an exact match check too once the hashes collide since hashes can have unintended collisions as well).<p>I have no idea how much efficiency this buys them, but the same mechanism can be used against a blacklist of known copyright or illegal materials. In this case, having a hash that matches something in the copyrighted materials list AND sharing it triggers this action.<p>Just as easily, putting some child porn in your DB could also have them check against illegal material hashes and trigger an automated notice to some law enforcement agency or something similar.<p>This can even be used for National Security without violating the classified contents of the documents. Say another Snowden-type grabs a bunch of classified documents. The agency could give DB a list of hashes with instructions to &quot;call us&quot; if a user uploads a bunch of leaked documents to their DB.

For one, VIX is real time, Animoto and Replay upload your videos to a server, do the edits on the server and you download the results.  For seconds you have the exact same precision in editing that you do with any other NLE, you can&#x27;t change anything with Animoto or that other thing except for picking a different theme.<p>Yes, you can let VIX automatically edit the video, but you can also change any edit down to the frame.<p>As I said before, you&#x27;re not going to make a movie with this.  You&#x27;re not going to edit a TV show with this.  But there are broad categories of other types of editing where VIX is perfectly suited.<p>So in summary, I made it because I needed it, I put it out there because I hoped others would find it useful.  If they don&#x27;t, it&#x27;s no real skin off my back, but I know that&#x27;s not the case.  Will it make me a million dollars?  No, not when I&#x27;m putting it out there for free.  I make the millions with the magazine and publishing platform I built VIX to help me build.<p>As for the posted video being unwatchable, it&#x27;s a matter of demographics and taste, I suppose.  It&#x27;s been tested with our target demo for Em Oi, Vietnamese women ages 18-24, and it tested pretty well against slower/less edits.

Did you bother to actually read any of it?<p><i>NIPCC is bankrolled by...</i><p>In other words, you didn&#x27;t bother to read any of it. You just assumed that they must be wrong because of their funding source. Well, guess what? If we&#x27;re going to judge by funding sources, the IPCC itself is just as suspect. They are funded by governments which have a vested interest in increasing government control over all aspects of life. Government-funded research is not likely to come up with the answer, &quot;No reason for government regulation here&quot;, even if it&#x27;s the right answer.<p>If you want to play the funding source finger-pointing game, sorry, I&#x27;m not interested.

It&#x27;s an <i>Intergovernmental</i> panel. It uses information from scientists, but the final reports, and particularly the summaries for &quot;policymakers&quot;, are driven by politics, not science.<p><i>the false equivalency you are choosing to employ</i><p>Not at all.

Many peer-reviewed papers turn out to be wrong, for a variety of reasons: honest mistakes, insufficient knowledge in the field, reviewers too busy to really review, and corruption of the peer review process by political agendas.<p>If you want to actually distinguish valid science from invalid science, you <i>have</i> to look at the content. There is simply no shortcut; there is no way to tell what&#x27;s valid science by looking at funding sources, or &quot;consensus&quot;, or any other indirect measure. You have to look at the actual content. In the case of the IPCC, there&#x27;s a very simple content question you can ask: have the IPCC&#x27;s predictions about the climate matched the actual climate? The answer to that question is &quot;no&quot;. No amount of harping on how wonderful the IPCC&#x27;s process is will change that.<p><i>I recommend this as a great summary:</i><p>This article makes the same mistake you are making: it looks at process instead of content.

They&#x27;ve invested (in the case of programming languages, potentially many years) in something, and want to feel like they&#x27;ve invested wisely. I think that&#x27;s also probably just human nature.<p>I disagree with the notion that programming languages need to be popular, at least, as popular as they needed to be in the past.<p>20 years ago it was important for languages to be popular because that was the only way they&#x27;d reach enough critical mass to be discoverable. Growing up, there was only one book store within driving distance of my house that had any programming books. That meant if you wanted to learn programming, you were limited to what had been &quot;blessed&quot; by industry (in my case, one book on C++ that was actually just a syntax reference). That seems to no longer be true (the internet has made discovery of programming languages easier in much the same way it&#x27;s made the discovery of everything easier).<p>There is certainly a benefit to having critical mass, but that mass seems to be much smaller than has ever been required in the past. I&#x27;ve seen Haskell developers on several occasions talk about the fact that Haskell&#x27;s popularity has been in this nice &quot;happy medium&quot; that provides enough eyeballs to flush out issues and provide feedback, but also allows them to not worry about breaking things.<p>A language getting popular is not all benefits with no drawbacks. It gets harder to make breaking changes to the language (Javascript can be considered a good cautionary tale about what can happen when a language becomes so popular that you are held hostage by backwards compatibility). And you can&#x27;t read a single article on here about some less popular language that doesn&#x27;t prompt at least one comment about how because the language isn&#x27;t popular, the quality of developers using it is higher (which is always posited as a plus for hiring developers in that language). Paul Graham mentioned it regarding Python explicitly in one of his essays.<p>More people being part of a community means more everything. More of what&#x27;s good (libraries, eyes looking at bugs, ideas on solving problems) and more of what&#x27;s bad (bike-shedding, shitty libraries, conflicting programming idioms).<p>I have no idea if there&#x27;s some magical sweet spot, where you get all the benefits of a language being popular without any of the detriments; but I suspect it doesn&#x27;t exist. As it stands, yes, I&#x27;d like there to be more Haskell libraries. I&#x27;d like there to be more blog posts about using Haskell for things that aren&#x27;t abstract math. But I&#x27;m not necessarily itching for Haskell to become much more popular.<p>We&#x27;re already starting to see some of the industry people that use Haskell start to explicitly target evangelism (like the work FP Complete is doing). I think it&#x27;s great that they want other people to use this thing that they like, but I am worried anytime a community switches from &quot;stealth&quot; mode to &quot;evangelism&quot; mode. Incentives around addressing problems starts to become perverse when you have to worry about messaging, and when you&#x27;re trying to convert other people.

4709652,comment,4709144,4709495,2,0,jackcviers3,,,"1. npm When installing packages with the --local flag, the npm package manager moves up the pwd path, looking for a node_modules directory. Once installed there, packages can be required by package name in dependent scripts. Common use case is to put a node_modules directory in your home directory to keep multi-project development dependencies out of your global system node install.<p>2. Ivy/Maven. Dependencies are placed in ~/.ivy, and are available for use without changing environment variables.<p>3. rubygems. A ~/.gems directory is created that provides dependencies by ruby version, if you wish.<p>Now, running a clis still requires an addition to path. But package managers do exist that organize dependencies on the user path without explicit environment variable edition.",1351450740

4709646,comment,4709022,4709311,2,0,JBiserkov,,,">the trouble to manage different keyboard layouts in their head<p>There are two main ways to type in Bulgarian on a PC: BDS - the National standard and Phonetic - a transliteration of Bulgarian (Cyrillic) letters into English ones.<p>I've always hated the Phonetic as its even worse than QWERTY. In high-school I forced myself to touch-type BDS so I can use it even on keyboards that don't have it. So when I heard about Dvorak in the university, I immediately decided to learn it since I already had two layouts in my muscle memory, a third one wouldn't be a problem. Initially I was using a Dwerty layout - a Dvorak when typing, a QWERTY when issuing commands (Ctrl+C, Ctrl+V), but since it was incompatible with Windows 8 I've abandoned it and am currently running on pure Dvorak.<p>I think an affinity towards foreign languages helps a lot, but have no research to back it up [besides Bulgarian I learned French (age 5 - 14), German in high school (age 14-19) and English (age 10-19) and recently (26) some Swedish].",1351450575

It achieves basically the same result, but faster. That's called performance optimization.<p>I once doubled a hot area of compiler performance by doing aggressive inlining and removing some tuple allocation for closure conversion. It couldn't be performed in every possible situation, obviously, but the 99% case had a 100% performance improvement. But I shouldn't have bothered because that was all a ""trick"", right?<p>A brief look at your comment history says you only comment on political stories, so I don't know if you're a developer or one who has worked in performance optimization, but let me give you a little advice -- it's all tricks. It's all shuffling around your I/O patterns to avoid cache misses and reducing allocation to lower memory pressure and all that other crap. If you increase performance by caching the kernel on disk, which has the same impact for 99% of people as doing a cold boot, that's a performance optimization, not a ""trick.""",1351450514

When I'm reading code I'm looking for different details at different times, I'm doing a lot of scanning. Sometimes it's functions, other times variables, strings etc. but being able to scan only items in a particular colour really speeds up my search. Syntax highlighting really helps with this.<p>I'm also not sure about the idea of trying to hold more code in your head. Over the last few years I've changed my practices so that I don't have to hold much information in my head. For me this is one of the key benefits of TDD for example. At this point I find context switching easy to do because I've externalised the majority of my process to tools and practices.<p>If anything, good syntax highlighting makes code a real pleasure to read.

They're just not the kind of wars that general will be trained for.  There is no front in Afghanistan.  The war out there are much less about the military application of force than about the political restoration of nations.  But the military is given the control of what's going on because of the poor security conditions.  The Afghan and Iraqi theaters are 'distractions' to what the military are prepared to do.<p>Generals are trained, like the rest of the army, for conventional warfare, to protect the sovereignty of their nations should a full scale war take place.  We could shift the focus of the training on counter-insurgency, but that would effectively train the whole army to responds to a single kind of problems: insurgency.  Then the country itself would be left with an army that is unable to defend its sovereignty, but that is very good at throwing down weak governments and shutting down rebellions.<p>Generals, along their careers, are not primarily trained for counter-insurgency.  Counter-insurgency is a spin-off of recent conflicts, but it's not the main goal of the military.  Because of that, there's no sentiment that generals should go on a theater and take care of it until it's over. They just go in and fill the seat.  The Afghans are well aware of this and it removes much credibility from our military : ""You say that you will change things, but the guy before you said that, and in 6 months the next guy will say the same thing.  I will still be there, and you will be back home.  I will still be stuck in this conflict, and you will watch TV with your children and talk strategy about an eventual clash with China.""<p>In a 'real' war, there's a sentiment of urgency, there's an actual threat.  The generals, the army, MUST defeat the enemy or a _real_ defeat will take place.  In a war like Iraq, Afghanistan or Vietnam, if they win or lose will not change much to their lives, except for the price of gas and some more or less fear in the airports.  It's more complex than the price of oil, but the end result is that recent conflicts are pawn-moves in the current state of the world.<p>It's in that sense that I say recent wars are not big enough.  They are not engaging enough to justify a shift in training, and they are not the type of war generals are mainly prepared for (thus the lessons they will get out of them are of limited apparent usefulness - although everybody thinks counter-insurgency is the big thing.)",1351449522

Honestly I don't care if I'm playing a game on a phone, console, or PC; as long as it's fun and engrossing I will play it.<p>I've downloaded a lot of games on my Android and iOS devices and a lot of the action games have touch controls that are awkward for me to use.  On the iPhone 5 my fingers cover up the speaker when I'm holding it for console-type game.<p>Also I'm not completely sold on in-app purchases.  I've tried a bunch of the top games and what little gameplay you're allowed to have for some of these games before you need to start paying to play is low.  It's obvious to me that they designed the games primarily to extract money from me through some flaw in human behavior as opposed to putting out a comprehensive experience.<p>One direction I'd love to see the gaming industry go is to see some form of resurrected OnLive.  I get my music via subscription and love it.  I really like the idea of some type of ""all-you-can-eat"" game subscription service kind of like what PSN is doing right now.<p>The other problem that was mentioned in the article was the cost of building some of these really nice games.  It reminds me of movies in the 90's and 2000's: lots of money spent on a flop at the end of the day.  I really don't know the answer to this one.  I love playing games with fancy graphics but know that a studio can only gamble on a few of those these days.  They're way too high-budget for an indie developer to make as well.",1351449519

All the way through to about the mid-90's when I started working on the system that would become Java. The new stuff was fun, Sun's politics were soul crushing.

I don't think there's anything that needs to change on HN as far as buttons or rules or design go.<p>The problem isn't how things work. The problem is that people are ignoring the guidelines, interpreting them differently, and sometimes the guidelines aren't enforced. Take the downvote for example. There are a few trains of thought on that button. Some truly think its there for comments they disagree with. Others believe (as I do) that they're there for comments that do not add to the discussion. Still others have different interpretations. Some people use it generously and others dont. I've heard people talk about flagging as if it were something we should use liberally. I think flagging should be reserved for the very worst of the worst and should be used sparingly. In almost 3 years here I've only used it once (I know my profile says I've only been here a few months but I had another account hellbanned after over a year because someone used the flag button quite liberally).<p>Beyond that, the larger problem is that there's been a huge influx of new members and the quality of comments has been diluted partly due to some newer folks wanting to be heard and doing so by being asses in the comments.

HN is known for very smart, best of the best kind of people. Therefor those who come here believe, rightly or wrongly, that they too are HN caliber people. The problem is, not everyone can be.

My electricity comes from similar government-subsidized infrastructure, and wouldn't even exist if the federal government hadn't poured enormous amounts of cash into the research of power generation and transmission technologies.<p>In short, my life story is one gigantic government subsidy, and odds are, so is yours.

But read the whole thing, it's in a logical progression.</i><p>OK ... so a linear equation is one of the form:<p><pre><code>    ax + by + ... + dz = n
</code></pre>
where the a, b, d and n are constants and the x, y, z, etc are the variables. You may be familiar with these when the constants are real numbers, but they can be from any field (more about that in a minute).<p>An example of a linear equation is<p><pre><code>    3x + 5y - 2z = 1
</code></pre>
So a system of linear equations is when you have lots of these. In large systems you may have literally millions of variables.<p>So what's this about a ""field""?<p>Well, in general the constants don't need to be real numbers. There are properties that we want, such as addition, multiplication, subtraction and division, but there are systems that have these sorts of things that are not the real numbers.  These are called fields.<p>For example, the rational numbers have all the properties we might want. We can add, subtract, divide and multiply rationals, and things work the way we would want.<p>But another example is the integers modulo 5.  The numbers 0, 1, 2, 3 and 4 have all the properties we want. We can divide by 2, for example, but multiplying by 3, because 2x3=6, which is 1 (modulo 5).<p>So we can have a field (a system with all the operations we want) that only has a finite number of elements.  There are others, but the most common ones are to take the integers modulo some prime number. The proof that we get a field is not har, and is actually interesting, but some people find it tedious.<p>So Prasad's work is for solving systems of linear equations where the constants are not real numbers, but come from a finite field.<p>Finally, one of the most common finite fields in the area of computing is the field that has just two elements - 0 and 1.<p>The other answers in this sub-thread are pretty good.

In most cases (for the projects I work on) we're talking about the difference of maybe 30-45 seconds.<p>Intellisense is cool; there's no doubt about it and there's not really anything that comes close in Vim (omnicompletion really does pale in comparison). That said, the only type of projects that I've ever felt I really used Intellisense were sprawling Java applications. I've never missed it while working on JavaScript or Ruby projects (and, anecdotally, I've heard many C and Python developers also talk about not needing this feature).<p>Ultimately, Vim benefits me with overall productivity (for example, it takes Vim an order of magnitude less time to start up than Eclipse on my Macbook Pro--and then proceeds to lock up every few minutes while it does GC or whatever the hell else it does to just randomly stop from time-to-time). While I'm in the mode of writing and editing code, it's also significantly faster and easier on my hands and arms to be totally keyboard focused.<p>All that said, it's a really text-centric form of programming that is somewhat different from the hand-holding (not meant as derogatory; just a statement of fact) and all-in-one approach that an IDE can give you.

So you look at one day and see it rained 10 inches and the stock price was $20. On the next day, it rained 6 inches and the stock price fell to $12.  What's the relationship between rain and stock price? Obviously 2x. How would your figure that out mathematically?<p>(Inches of rain) * ( relationship ) = ( stock price )<p>So we must find a relationship ( we'll call it r) that works for both of these equations
(10)<i>(r)= 20
(6)</i>(r)= 12<p>Obvs r=2. That was easy. What if you think this is too simple and the stock price is actually related to both rain fall and the temperature.<p>We need a new equation
(Inches of rain)<i>(relationship 1) + (temperature)</i>(relationship 2) = ( stock price )<p>Relationship 1 and relationship 2 are different values, because maybe rain has a much bigger impact on the stock price than temperature. So we need to solve for r1 and r2. (Try making up numbers for rain, temperature, and price on 3 days, and you'll find this gets ugly to solve.)<p>Then you decide again this is too simple, and the stock price replies on rain, temperature, the moons distance from the earth, the amount of red cars you see on the way to work, etc. Now we have a lot of big equations, that we'd like to solve. Once we solve them we can determine the relationships each factor has on the stock price and tomorrow we can look at all the inputs (temperature, rainfall, etc) and predict the stock price. Matrices are a way of representing all these equations at once.<p>Matrices are just a data structure, a way of representing equations. Just like computer data structures, matrices have certain functions that you can perform on them, like adding or multiplying them with other matrices.<p>There are lots of applications that use really really big matrices with thousands of inputs and we'd like to solve these matrices ( ie. find the relationships ).<p>There are a lot of ways of solving this, like Gauss-Jordan Elimination (which you probably know how to do even if you don't know that you know how). The problem is that most of these algorithms are very slow, because they perform lots of computations manipulating the matrices in order to solve them.<p>(I have to get back to work so the rest is real short.) In short, this new algorithm is just a really clever guess and check, sort of like genetic algorithms. The algorithm guesses possible values for each relationship. If a set of relationships (aka a vector) fits some of the equations (but not all), then the algorithm generates more relationships similar to it. This goes on until the algorithm finds a set of values for relationships that work in each equation.",1344616671

When Detroit was giving out pensions like candy, it was the top-grossing industry in the world; they were making margins close to what Apple makes today.  It helped them recruit the best and brightest talent.  But then a funny thing happened: the market corrected itself.  Cars stopped earning bank. Margins fell, and even the biggest carmakers started going out of business.<p>We're in the glory days of the web industry, the only difference being that most websites don't even make money before getting sold.  But investors will catch on, eventually, like they always do.  And when that happens, policies like this will start to go away, just like they did for Detroit.",1344616615

You can add and multiply these (mod 7): 6 + 2 == 1, 2 * 5 == 3.  The elements 0 and 1 work as you'd expect to satisfy the usual identities of arithmetic.

For main street corporates this is the last thing they want, cutting away efficiency for what?

Inline constants like that are just as bad as global variables, and there's now a giant refactor danger in the code from people (a) reimplementing this constant and (b) not updating the original one, if it becomes used in more than one place. Neither solution is great, here, but this is game data that should not be expressed in code; it should, ideally, be in some kind of asset.<p>Additionally, this is a judgment call, but I feel that adding whitespace to line up the color constants violates the spirit of PEP 8, if not the letter:<p><a href=""http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/#whitespace-in-expressions-and-statements"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/#whitespace-in-expre...</a><p>2. Magic numbers are bad. Littering the file with SHOUTING constants is worse. As with the powerups from item 1, move this to a configuration of some kind rather than expressing it in code.<p>3.

At least it mentioned the return type, which is good.<p>Do not refactor someone else's code and change their indentation style because it fits your preference. That's just being argumentative, and unproductive.

Fine.<p>9. The addition of the conditional does not make the call simpler, and the author has now introduced two calls to random() instead of one. Although the original implementation of random_position() can certainly be improved, this change makes it worse in potentially performance-important code.

4366798,comment,4365908,4366431,3,0,jandrewrogers,,,"In fact, database theory was originally conceived as hyper-dimensional metric space in which both data and selection could be mapped to hyper-rectangles in the space. A hyper-plane or a point in the metric space is just a degenerate hyper-rectangle with the same dimensionality as the metric space. It has always been the most elegant way to represent a database.<p>One of the best written expositions of databases properly expressed as operations over hyper-dimensional spaces was produced by Rudolf Bayer, the guy that invented the B-Tree. In the late 1990s he invented a multidimensional indexing structure based on space-filling curves called a UB-Tree and they wrote at length about how various database operations are implemented using that representation. It is generally informative if you are unfamiliar with this aspect of database theory, not just in the context of UB-Trees about which it was written.<p>If it is such a great idea then why does no major database implement things this way? Despite several attempts by companies like Oracle, IBM, and Microsoft, no one has described a generalized data structure for databases with hyper-rectangle operands as your primitives. There are dozens of narrow algorithm solutions known, both published and unpublished, but none that you could legitimately use in a commercial database system because they all have limitations that will adversely affect real-world applications.<p>Hyperdex is a conventional algorithm from the standpoint of indexing hyper-dimensional spaces. They are not doing anything new there that has not been done before. However, the update value chaining element of it is actually pretty neat.",1344615227

You can't really justify contributing to ""effect of the society"".<p>Its difficult to understand why one should pay for economic troubles of HF traders, especially when they are known to cheat on taxes, when they take 0 responsibilities for their actions and above all don't add any value.<p>A man definitely benefits a lot from the collective contributions of the society. But those benefits apply equally to everybody, yet please note not every one achieves the same things in life as everybody else. There fore to now say the sum total of a man's accomplishments is all due to society is wrong. That is why a man contributes back only as much as what he benefited.<p>Therefore, take responsibilities for both your successes and failures. Applies not just to individual but to every other entity like corporations and banks. Its difficult to understand why a common man should bail out a bank. While the common man has already contributed his fair share of taxes.<p>If I make a mistake or do well. I take responsibility for both my successes and failures. So should banks and corporations. Both should contribute their share of taxes. But you almost always see, that the rich and powerful cheat yet benefit from the taxes contributed by everybody else.

Without a baseline level of infrastructure new economic activity cannot develop.<p>This is also why bootstrapping a city is the hardest thing ever, and all of these planned cities never work out.

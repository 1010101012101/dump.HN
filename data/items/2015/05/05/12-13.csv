A doesn&#x27;t in any way see the error (though it may be restarted if part of the same supervisor, and it may timeout and crash if waiting for a response). So handling that message/not handling that message doesn&#x27;t affect debugging; the top of your stack trace will be in B, regardless (and you may have a separate one at A if it times out waiting for a response from B, or if it&#x27;s been linked to B such that it dies when B dies).

I understand the initial manned launches will use parachutes for landing as well.<p>What I&#x27;m wondering is, will they eventually carry enough fuel to both be able to do an abort, and then do a powered landing, if required? I assume so, since at that point the only cost in terms of weight to be able to do the abort as well as the landing would be the weight of the fuel for the abort itself.<p>Also if the capsule will be capable of an abort at any stage in the ascent, what preparations will be in place to allow for capsule recovery? Presumably it could come down anywhere along the line of flight, up to the point at which it achieves orbit. That could include the middle of Africa, and maybe even the Indian Ocean.

The algorithm was this:\nTest each tile for distance to water (you don&#x27;t have to get this absolutely perfect, just check in about 8 different directions from the centre of the tile).  The closer the tile is to water, apply a scaling factor to the elevation, such that at MAX_DISTANCE you scale by 1, at 0 (water&#x27;s edge) you scale by a factor of 0 (ie you will always have 0 elevation.  The exact curve of the scaling factor can be played around with to give you sharper or smoother coastlines...

The whole point of the virtual dom model is to avoid stateful DOM manipulation and instead have view code that is an idempotent (and generally pure) transformation from app state to virtual dom. This is a great fit for any functional programming language and makes keeping the DOM in sync mostly a solved problem.<p>I haven&#x27;t tried Mithril in cljs personally but it fits the model so you should be fine with just writing a wrapper function or macro to save some boiler plate on the cljs to js data structure conversion.<p>The challenges in the cljs app I&#x27;m working on are the same challenges you run into any app: how do you separate concerns, where does state reside, how do you keep it in sync with the server, etc. A problem that&#x27;s unique to React based apps is how to get data from your app state to a component without higher level components needing to be changed.<p>My main annoyance with cljs is that rethrowing errors in Chrome swallows the stack trace and core.async wraps everything in a try/catch block. This means that you need to debug by breaking on error, typing `ex.stack` in the console, and reading compiled JS frames to find the source.",1430827834

9491995,comment,9489237,9489475,0,0,spydum,,,"the problem here is the medical community (especially hospitals) are increasingly pressured to increase productivity to offset cost increases. one way is to automate some of the dreary stuff like monitoring of medical devices in a hospital ward. if youve been in a relatively modern hospital lately, youll find they have wall mounted dashboards which can monitor all the vitals and devices for patients without the nurse needing to walk around and check rooms. this lets them respond to changes as they come up, as opposed to needing to wait till they make their rounds to the room.<p>this sort of thing needs a network. I&#x27;m not familiar, but I thought in the US, HIPPA covered some of this stuff.. not sure how stringent it is, or if it covers scenarios like this.. perhaps it doesnt at all (I am thinking like PCI, where certain data must be encrypted, etc).",1430827558

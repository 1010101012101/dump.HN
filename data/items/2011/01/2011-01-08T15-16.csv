2083234,comment,2081124,2083059,0,0,barrkel,,,"I don't know what you're specifically missing, but it is important to be aware of the basics of how RPN works, i.e. reverse polish notation, as stack machines in the JVM, .NET etc. are essentially RPN calculators with a lot of extra bits and bobs.<p>5 + 4 * 2, in RPN with an explicit push opcode, looks like this:<p><pre><code>    push 5
    push 4
    push 2
    multiply
    add
</code></pre>
Each operation manipulates a stack. Here it is, marked up with the stack:<p><pre><code>    push 5
    // now stack is: 5 (top of stack is leftmost)
    push 4
    // now stack is: 4 5
    push 2
    // stack: 2 4 5
    multiply // pop top two on stack, multiply, and push
    // stack: 8 5
    add
    // stack: 13
</code></pre>
Add in a few more opcodes, and instead of pushing simple integer constants, you can push an object reference instead; and instead of a multiply or add opcode, you might have a getfield or putfield opcode, which takes an argument (in the opcode stream, rather than on the stack) indicating which field to read or write. Similarly for functions to call, constructors to call when creating an object, etc.<p>JVM uses an explicitly typed instruction set. There are variants of each operation, such as those starting with a (e.g. aload - JVM spells push as load) for objects, starting with i for integers, and f for floats (so iadd is different from fadd). Part of the verification the JVM does when loading classes is to simulate the stack operations and make sure that the operations match up with their types; the type associated with each opcode is technically redundant, and was probably done that way to help in making simple interpreters slightly faster. .NET doesn't do this; it has a single add instruction etc., and instead infers the type of the arguments by what was pushed onto the stack. .NET stack code requires at least an analysis pass to interpret with any efficiency.",1294502391

2083230,comment,2078361,2080299,0,0,gvb,,,"Here is a personal anecdote on the cost of not hiring a right person.<p>I have a very strong background in low level (embedded as well as device driver) software development.  I have a long and visible track record in U-Boot development, including being a sub-repository ""lieutenant"".<p>Canonical advertised for a ""Ubuntu Mobile Developer - ARM"" developer for which I felt (and still feel) I was a very strong candidate.  I submitted my resume and got no response.  I did some searching and found the contact within Canonical who was responsible for the position and got an immediate response when I contacted him.<p>I did a phone interview with a Canonical employee, not the person hiring but another who was a technical expert.  I thought the interview went well overall, but he seemed disturbed that I had not actively used Bazaar even though I had used other DVCSes, including evaluating several of them for U-Boot - I ultimately recommended git for U-Boot.  I've also used Mercurial extensively in my job, so I would say I have more than passing familiarity with DVCSes.<p>Anyway, I didn't ""make the cut"" with Canonical.  I've since gotten a new job and am no longer in the market, but Canonical is now advertising for <i>three</i> software engineers for that position <a href=""http://webapps.ubuntu.com/employment/canonical_SE%20PS%20HB1/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://webapps.ubuntu.com/employment/canonical_SE%20PS%20HB1...</a>.<p>The kicker?  Canonical did <i>not</i> have ""familiarly with uBoot"" [sic] as a desirable qualification for candidates before I applied.  They added it immediately after I entered their interview process.  In other words, Canonical did not even know they were looking for me before I applied, discovered that at least one of my qualifications were important <i>because I applied</i>, and yet did not hire me.  <i>A year and a half later,</i> not only have they not filled the position, they now have <i>three copies</i> of the unfilled position.<p>Go figure.",1294502246

Subjectively, DDG result relevance seems to be improving lately.<p>I also block Google's Javascript analytics and ads, as I do all other third parties.

2083218,comment,2082846,2082846,0,0,Umalu,,,"It is a common complaint in pyramid-shaped hierarchies that the ""best"" people leave. This is because they have to leave. As they climb the ladder, the rungs get smaller so fewer can fit. Each year, many of the people who were the best the year before (and got to the next rung on the ladder) have to leave. So people in organizations like this naturally come to think that the ""best"" people leave -- because eventually they all do. Of course, it is possible to design a hierarchy so dysfunctional that the best people leave and the worst people stay, and I don't know enough about the armed services to assess whether that's the case here, but whenever I read about the best leaving, I wonder how much of that's an intended feature or an unintended bug.",1294501747

2083205,comment,2083192,2083192,0,0,antirez,,,"Background: in most work loads, with the default glibc malloc() and without the use of any slab allocator, Redis apparently does not fragment memory even after many months of continuous uptime (I've an instance running since one year, with tons of expires and 10000 new keys created per second, without issues, for instance).<p>However some user experimented Redis fragmentation problems, especially when sorted sets are used. This makes sense as in sorted sets nodes have different sizes (accordingly to the number of links).<p>This contest have the goal to get in short time a program that is able to fragment memory in a easy to reproduce way, so that we can start working to an (optional) slab allocator for Redis that will be included in future releases.<p>As Redis allocations are already completely wrappered by zmalloc.c file to ship a version of Redis with a new allocator will be trivial and will not affect any other part of the system, so as long as we'll get a few memory fragmenting scripts, chances are that in short time we'll exit with a new version of Redis featuring this change.<p>Thank you!<p>p.s.

I don't see how he's turned from Apple <i>pundit</i> to Apple <i>fanboy</i>, a rather peculiar thing to happen to <i>anyone</i> with time, really.<p>What has changed is that Apple's success has accelerated, exposing Apple to more customers, press and analysis. Gruber has <i>always</i> covered these things, but with more of it there's more to cover, and with more clueless analysts claiming things about Apple, there's more of that to dispute and ridicule.<p>And let's just face it, he's usually <i>right</i> about the significant things. That's not fanboyism, that's insight.<p>Besides, I don't think Gruber very often writes articles just to ""support"" anything (what would be the point?), usually he's trying to understand where Apple's motivations come from — <i>why</i> they're doing what they're doing — which is the part where most other analysts are fumbling in the dark.<p>Sometimes he agrees with them, but really, a lot of the time he doesn't (that usually makes for more interesting articles as well).

I felt a bit burned out when I left my job, mainly because of boredom... For example, a whole day could be about fixing a connectivity issue in some department or essentially getting their phones and other equipment to work... I know, every job can get repetitive and boring eventually, but I also wanted to work on something that had more substance if you know what I mean...<p>Well, I am really interested in Computer Forensics, and hope to move in this direction upon finishing my degree. Is anyone currently work in this field that can give some pointers as to how I can get started? I'd also love to hear ""a day in the life"" story if you have any.

8668425,comment,8667689,8667689,0,0,runarberg,,,"I was homeless (living in a bus) with my girlfriend in San Francisco two years ago for 6 months and finding showers and shaving was one of the more difficult of necessities. There was a homeless facility in our neighbourhood (the Mission) that offered showers on Tuesdays and Thursdays, I usually went once a week. There was also girls only facility that my girlfriend used on Wednesday. Theoretically We could have taken the muni to other parts of the city for showers on other days, but the time and effort is usually not worth it (there is usually some 1-2 hours of waiting list involved). Other times we went to San Francisco State University for a shower. Although it&#x27;s far away, the facilities are so comfy and sufficient compared to the homeless facilities that it is worth the trip, especially for shaving.<p>Toilets were less of a problem, we used cafÃ©s, public parks, constructions porter potties (non-padlocked), and grocery stores. And laundry was no problem at all (we just used the coin-ups).<p>I definitely agree with greater variability of sanitation possibilities. Especially when it comes to showers.",1417114224

But you get to pick one of two rules to play by:<p>A) You get to pick one door you want and get what&#x27;s behind that door.<p>B) You get to pick one door you don&#x27;t want and get the better prize behind the other two doors.<p>Pretty much everyone is going to pick rule B.  So after picking the door you don&#x27;t want I will open the other doors.  If the car is behind one of those doors I will always open that door last.  Does the last sentence make you wish you picked rule A to play by?  Heck no.  We already know that one of those two will be a goat.  The order I open the doors won&#x27;t change anything.<p>Even if I let you retroactively switch to rule A after opening the first door?  This is what trips people up.  They think they&#x27;re getting new information and that their original door choice may be incorrect.<p>But in this version of the game it&#x27;s easy to see that we&#x27;re not changing our choice of door, we&#x27;re changing from the better game rule B to the worse rule A.<p>So the correct choice is to always stick with rule B.<p>Now we map the rules onto the real Monty Hall game.  Rule A is pick the door you want and stick with it.  Rule B is pick the door you don&#x27;t want and switch.<p>So the correct choice is to always switch.",1417114207

We have rational and emotional/irrational habits/reactions ...etc. Generally, historians look at the documents left or recorded and construct some picture. But I feel, no one or no entity records every emotion, every reaction, every action they do or involve ...etc. So there will always gaps/holes and there will always be unknown unknowns. Sometimes, we feel, we reached conclusions and may be awards are given and after few years, some new leads open up and it may change whatever we know till then making us feel like fools to trust in the beginning. Then there are many, who won&#x27;t record anything, no trace at all. We are around 7 billion people now approximately and how much we record daily about ourselves for <i>others i.e. future historians</i>? I feel recording for future historians is overhead. Writing diary for yourself is different thing altogether.<p>So in conclusion, please do not conclude whatever you read as final w.r.t history even though it may be detailed or how well it may be written.

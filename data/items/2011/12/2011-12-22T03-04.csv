I find graphs to be fundamental, so I would start the student out with them.<p>1. Teach the student basic concepts in graph theory such as nodes, edges, walks, paths, cycles, and structures such as trees, and linked lists.<p>2. Introduce the student to syntax trees as a means of representing mathematical equations, and the representation of them used in Lisp: (+ (* a x x) (* b x) c).<p>3. Describe dataflow graphs to the student. For example, loops are cycles in the dataflow graph, and infinite loops occur when the cycle is endless.",1324526344

I think it's hated mostly by those who don't use Python, and well-loved by those who do.<p>It was not the first programming language to use significant whitespace, but it is probably the most mainstream one that does, and it did pave the way for other languages to do the same. So it makes sense (IMHO) that sometimes other languages copy this feature, because it makes code shorter and more readable.<p>I haven't really heard any good arguments <i>against</i> significant whitespace, just the usual ""but when I copy & paste a block the indentation might be off"" (so use the indent/dedent function in your editor) and ""I cannot mix tabs and spaces"" (which you shouldn't do to begin with).

Software, for the most part is about money, either making it or saving it, the jury is no longer out as to whether web apps save money or not, it is a forgone conclusion that even with all the cruft, web application development is far cheaper than delivering to multiple platforms. An argument could be made for a cross platform environment like AIR but the momentum is behind web apps. The reality is there is no wrong or right in development, it is what we the developers make it, and the majority of developers like web apps because they deliver on the promise to target multiple platforms with a single code base. Web apps being wrong is a very subjective statement, they are right for a great deal of value to investment arguments and in the end those are factored into decisions about what to target with development dollars.",1324526184

The encoding of each symbol is very well defined and supported by programs already.  It is actually better to have that exact definition than an ASCII word that may or may not be supported by all editors (and if it's not, as you said some symbols look similar; which one is intended?).<p>I don't think keyboards will change much until some related tech becomes cheaper, too.  Two key ones I think are cheap mini-displays per key (so the whole keyboard can display new glyphs if need be), and a companion touch-screen for <i>drawing</i> non-trivial glyphs that are needed only occasionally.

The circulation extends outwards indefinitely, and so an instant force-pair connects the wing with the surface of the Earth.<p>In 2D, the airfoil circulation creates lift upon the moving airfoil, but it also creates an equal down-force against the ground.  If the airfoil was flying higher, the force pattern on the ground grows wider, but the net downforce doesn't change.  As a result, 2D airfoil diagrams do not describe normal flight.  They describe a sort of ""Flatland flight"" where no net work needs be done to accelerate mass downwards. As an explanation of aircraft, they've been simplified until they cross the line into actual error.<p>In the 3D world we can launch a vortex downward and experience a reaction force upward.  Or perhaps launch a vortex sideways (during turns.)  No instant-force upon the Earth is needed.  The Newtonian force-pair arises between the mass-bearing aircraft and the mass-bearing air entrained by the shed vortex.  Hovering rockets have an exhaust plume, and flying airplanes have a descending vortex-pair, and both are essential to any explanation.  Real world 3D flight is ""vortex-shedding flight,"" and the explanations based on 2D airfoil diagrams leads to no end of confusion.",1324524879

Denker's ""See How It Flies"" (<a href=""http://www.av8n.com/how/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.av8n.com/how/</a>), which along with more ""aviating"" tips has a good discussion about circulation, the Kutta condition and the Kutta-Zhukovsky theorem. The Wikipedia page on the Kutta condition (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kutta_condition"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kutta_condition</a>) is also quite informative.<p>I especially like this part from See How It Flies:<p><pre><code>  We have seen that several physical principles are involved in producing lift.\n  Each of the following statements is correct as far as it goes:\n\n  * The wing produces lift “because” it is flying at an angle of attack.\n  * The wing produces lift “because” of circulation.\n  * The wing produces lift “because” of Bernoulli’s principle.\n  * The wing produces lift “because” of Newton’s law of action and reaction.\n\n  ... Do we get a little bit of lift because of Bernoulli, and a little bit more\n  because of Newton? No, the laws of physics are not cumulative in this way.\n  There is only one lift-producing process. Each of the explanations itemized\n  above concentrates on a different aspect of this one process.\n</code></pre>\nI think this is the crux of the matter. It's sort the same story as in the recent HN post about the hazards of determining cause and effect in medical research. The laws of physics set up a situation where the solution satisfying all the constraints is that the wing produces lift. But just like you can't pull out one equation out of a linear system and say that the solution is X=13 <i>because</i> of this one equation, one can't say that a wing produces lift <i>because</i> of any one physical effect.",1324523113

Entire albums leaked before they drop. iPhones jailbroken so apps can be ripped off. Game-consoles hacked so that people can play games without paying for the service. The list goes on and on and on. It’s a culture of petty thievery. The definition of sharing needs to change, for sure, but it's new definition will never be like the start of this paragraph.<p>What we have now is a totally unbalanced system. As noted elsewhere, it is like the older generation who thought a one-way relationship with planet earth was as reasonable as it was convenient  - take whatever you need, dump whatever you don’t  - nothing bad will ever come of it and if it does it’s always someone else’s problem.<p>“I don’t need to pay for this movie - plenty of people already have.”\n“I don’t need to recycle - so many people are already doing that.”<p>“So even if some bands don’t make it, there’ll always be other bands. They need to adapt”\n“We’ve got so many species, is it a big deal if we lose some? That’s evolution isn’t it?”<p>“I don’t feel bad ripping stuff off - I spend plenty of money on media anyway.”\n“I don’t feel bad about dumping garbage in the woods - I pay my taxes.”<p>When you live like that, you live with the consequences of having no regard for the balance of the system - and you reap the whirlwind you whip up.<p>I don’t support SOPA - but I also think the total lack of respect for the side of content-producers is a miserable state of affairs - and amounts to a enacted prejudice against people who produce content, shamefully defended with the language of equality and freedom. If one wants to release stuff for free and seed their own torrents - they have every right to choose that ‘business model’ - but to force that choice, to force artists into situations that make them into sharecroppers - is consumerism every bit as wicked and morally empty as capitalism has been. “Let them eat cake!” [Let them sell t-shirts] Does it make it okay because Ashton Kutcher says so? To cover his investments and enhance his street cred?<p>I don't have a solution for SOPA. I do have ideas about how to ease piracy in a positive way - but no idea stands up when most people don't give a damn - and they don't. Reading some of the exculpatory comments on SOPA/piracy threads has made that embarrassingly clear.",1324522995

If the carriers want to screw you, they already have means to do so.<p>In fact, I suspect a phone with a virtual SIM card may be easier to unlock than a physical one since Apple must distribute software designed to program the virtual SIM card. You also won't need to physically get a SIM card to use a network and you'll be able to use multiple networks with the same phone. That sounds like a plus to me.<p>Regardless, the SIM card is certainly not the limiting factor in carrier portability or locking. It's essentially a floppy disk, and is quite unnecessary given data connectivity these days.<p>The idea that Apple wanted a smaller SIM as a step closer to no SIM is ridiculous. What difference does the size make? Having a card or not having a card is binary.",1336845161

At a previous company they had trouble because the developers needed administrator access to their Windows systems because they needed to install a lot of different software and run many things in administrative mode (server development).  It was a constant tension between developers and security.  I wonder how it is with Linux, which might have more fine-grained controls and an easier way to install per-user software.<p>I'm surprised xmonad got a mention.  I interpreted it as a window manager that didn't have much traction outside of the Haskell community, particularly with all the configuration being done in Haskell.  Perhaps it was just an example of an one of the more strange requests.<p>That said, I love xmonad.

Cocoa comes to mind.<p>HTML/CSS/JavaScript were never created to build applications, and it's very apparent when you do so. I've built a lot of web apps, but out of necessity. I think we're going to actually see the opposite trend in software: moving client-server apps away from browser-based solutions and toward native apps. In fact we're already seeing that movementand I would argue that a big reason behind it is how much writing client apps in JavaScript sucks.",1336844425

Put into that perspective, it seems it would definitely be beneficial to not be shy if you had the choice - and that's what the author here is trying to get at. I was suicidal and shy all throughout school, until sophomore year of high school. That's when I became so fed up with my piece of shit life that I gave myself an ultimatum to change it. Started throwing myself into social situations (for me, it was primarily my utter inability to be attractive to girls that was making me suicidal - I couldn't even <i>start</i> to speak to a girl - <i>any</i> girl), and bit by bit, sophomore year entirely changed the trajectory of my life.<p>In retrospect, I was enormously awkward in all my first attempts to break my shyness, and it was entirely fueled by feelings of inadequacy and coming to <i>identify</i> with my current state - seeing it as an inherent part of me. I was <i>born</i> shy, this <i>is</i> the way I'm am, I can't change it, it's impossible, this is just who I am and it sucks shit and I'll kill myself eventually. Utterly defeatist talk. If you think that way, if you never even make the concerted attempt (do it for 3 months, at least, concerted full force and then you can say you've made the attempt and it failed miserably), then of course you're never going to change and it might as well not be a choice, even though it truly is.It's tough as shit, but you can get over it. And over time, what the author means is that it becomes more than habit - it becomes so deeply ingrained into your own perception of yourself that you can't escape it. At some point, you don't even try, and you condemn yourself to a pointless life of suffering and missed potential. Don't let it happen.<p>Anyway, to finish up my personal story - I've fairly completely lost all my shyness, though there are still times where I can't think of anything to say and am entirely out of my element at a social gathering. I'm just now realizing that I'm almost certainly a massive introvert, but as has been said already here, introversion isn't the same thing as shyness. Those who are shy will very likely tend towards introversion and those who are introverted may quite likely become shy as a lack of exposure to social situations, but learning how to cope with social situations and not be afraid is simply a result of experience, practice, and exposure. Do it enough and you'll realize there's nothing to be afraid of.<p>As a result of my first forays with girls in sophomore year, I realized I could change almost anything about myself that up to that point I had assumed were inherent failings in my being - I started taking the hardest classes in school, joined cross country (had never been athletic before), hell, even joined Speech and Debate Team and started my own microfinance organization...went on to fairly unequivocally become the highest achiever in my school, first person in its history to attend Harvard, now on leave to build a startup, traveled to all 7 continents last year largely on my own, etc. etc. No longer suicidal at all. Needless to say, my life was entirely transformed by that one simple decision I made in the summer before sophomore year of high school - to be fed up with the subpar person I was being, to refuse to accept my shyness, and to do something about it. Small changes can take you a far way.<p>Tangential, but pertinent in attitude:  <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=qX9FSZJu448"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=q...</a><p>Best of luck!",1336844372

This upset a lot of apple-carts and now we are at a very difficult moment for the union and for Greece.<p>As it is there are no real good solutions. Greece leaving the euro zone or being forced out will have big consequences for all parties involved and likely the end result of that route would be <i>much</i> worse for the general Greek population than any level of austerity that is currently in effect.<p>Greece staying in the eurozone will require a lot of very unpopular sacrifices in many places, the end result of which will be a much weaker euro.<p>There are no winners in any of these scenarios, only losers and it will take a long time (decades?) to fix this problem properly.<p>What you are seeing here is the result of the EU growing too fast in order to win the pissing match about which economic block is the largest on the world stage. If the forging of the monetary union would have been done in a more restrained fashion a lot of this misery could have been avoided.<p>Cowboy politics a decade ago are what caused this, emotional reactions to the problem at hand certainly won't repair it overnight. It will get worse before it can begin to get better.",1336843301

Fortran was able to use the same format specification for more than one print statement, that's why the format statement is referenced by number. It was even able to do repeats, for example this code from 1956<p><pre><code>        PRINT 2, X, Y, A, B, C, D, N
      2 FORMAT ( 3 ( F10.3, F10.4 ), I4 )

I would suggest reading some academic papers on the type of work you would like to do and then look at the path that the authors followed.  You can also contact the authors and express an interest.

The 'aha' at the time was to store the graphics not as bitmaps, but as a stream of parameters that were interpreted, allowing my system to save hundreds of quiz questions on a single floppy. That vector approach also made editing objects and layers trivially simple. Got the attention of ETS and Addison Wesley, both of whom flew me out to demonstrate how I did it.<p>But when I started building my own software product to sell and support, adding things like one of the first networked learning management systems and a homemade graphics windowing system (schools were MSDOS or Apple II in the day, if you wanted a GUI you built one) I switched everything over to C even though that meant teaching myself C and re-architecting everything from scratch.<p>Creating and working with abstraction layers was critical to that project's success, and simply not doable in Forth.

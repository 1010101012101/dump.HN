26056,comment,25847,25847,0,0,ciordia9,,,"Posted on the site, and have further thoughts.  <p>""Work hard for a year, save enough, be diligent, and you too can fund your own startup."", was the basic summation of the article in the end.<p>The tools I'm working on require partnerships with different service carriers which can run as much as 10k a month, then you have contractors, lawyers, designers to pay.  You'd have to have one helluva job to pay for all that.  My partner and I have been using our salaries, equity lines, savings, for a year and it's not enough.<p>Playing the slow-goer, almost like a casual gamer, won't always work.  In a years time maybe you'll get married.  Maybe you'll have a kid.  Maybe you'll get fired. Maybe you'll want to go live on an island and harvest coconuts. Not to mention the market might be radically different by the time you even launch. <p>If you have an idea, and you want to see it birthed, and you know what it will take, and you can write a plan that shows it--because you did the hard work to see it through--then birth that bad boy.<p>Term sheets aren't all horrible.  Don't ask for the moon, be realistic, get what you need and make sure you don't have to go get more.  Don't get an office, be frugal, hire the best, negotiate well, partner with those who are assets and share the love.<p>This isn't rocket science but it does take careful thought and solid reasons.  Do your homework and make the right decision for you and your product.<p>-a",1180834552

Pick one, but I don't think it's safe for a person to get all three and step on board the startup instability train.<p>Yes, you may find kindred spirits.<p>Yes, you may find yourself back in the job search doldrums--how long does it take before you go back to the banks (insert your locales stable tech-pool) to put food on the table.<p>Startups rock, but they not be feasibly rockable for everyone. ;D  You do what you need to, and that can only be done by the do-er.

If they could speed the process by aquiring Clicky's instant gratification it'd be a dangerous total package.",1180833136

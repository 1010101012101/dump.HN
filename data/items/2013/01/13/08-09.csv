The networks have conspired to dumb us down. But when you get a little older, you realize thats not true. The networks are in business to give people exactly what they want. Thats a far more depressing thought. Conspiracy is optimistic! You can shoot the bastards! We can have a revolution! But the networks are really in business to give people what they want. Its the truth.</i><p>I think that's largely true with the proliferation of felonies also. It's not a handful of elites who want absurdly long sentences for ""computer hackers"" and shoplifting; a huge proportion of middle-class ""regular"" people have absurdly retributive views on throwing people in jail for long sentences.<p>I think there are other things, especially in the economic sphere, where the concentration of wealth is a likely factor explaining our current situation. But when it comes to ""tough on crime"", that's middle-class suburban America voting its fears.",1358067451

At minimum, whole OS and all software packages have to be reinstalled from known clean media, and whole software stack needs to be recreated from scratch, without using backups (which could be compromised too). If you're properly paranoid, add new hardware too (most of the current hardware is programmable at some level, i.e. needs to be replaced after a breakin). And then you need to invalidate all passwords on all the systems and have everybody to reset their passwords. And not only user login passwords - all router passwords, domain passwords, service logins, everything.<p>I can easily see how such work can take, for multiple systems, several weeks and 41K is not an outrageous sum for completely recreating the system.

The main component of the deal: copyright owners \n  with books scanned by Google under its library program can \n  choose to opt out of the program and have their books \n  removed. Of course, that settlement condition is something \n  Google has offered copyright owners with books in the \n  program all along.\n</code></pre>\nIn other words, Google scanned and posted to the web <i>first</i>, and authors could opt-out if they so chose. So they didn't get consent first. Their rationale was good - there was no machine readable contact information and many of the authors were dead or had moved - but in this respect the situations are reasonably analogous.<p>Had Aaron scraped say 10-100k rather than 4M articles and done some innovative NLP/data mining on the text (like Google N-grams), then showed that to JSTOR, despite the lack of up-front consent he might well have been able to get more or convince them to open up, especially if this 10-100k experiment showed monetization potential and could allow JSTOR to move to an open access model.

You just reduce the dose slowly enough to keep the withdrawal symptoms manageable.<p>Psychological addiction is much harder.  Psychological addiction is a bit of your brain screaming, ""I know how to solve this problem.  Go out and get drunk / wired / naked right now!""  And it works -- you feel good for a while.  The habit becomes so ingrained you don't even notice the triggers -- just the compulsion.<p>On a deeper level, you have other habits of thought -- automatic assumptions and emotional responses baked in from childhood.  These are the cause of the distress that led you down the path of addiction.<p>There comes a point when these coping reflexes cause more distress than they alleviate.  You're reaching that point now, and you recognize that you're tipping into a crisis.  So now you have a real choice: plunge forward, or step back from the brink.<p>Perhaps the best thing for you to do is to find an environment devoid of all the triggers for your compulsions (no vodka bottles or horny sugar daddies) and someone who can help you examine what's compelling you.  Maybe some kind of spiritual retreat?  I've mentioned this before, but Cognitive Behavioral Therapy really is effective.<p>Whatever you do, don't give up on yourself.

They reached out to the authorities to help stop the theft. Swartz returned the data, and JSTOR agreed not to pursue (civil) legal action against him. It's unfortunate that the US government couldn't match JSTOR's level of reasonableness. Yes, Swartz did something illegal, but the time (~35 year prison term and $1m fine) did not fit the crime.<p>I can't help but be reminded of the MPAA/RIAA vs. John Doe lawsuits that were commonplace just a couple years ago. It's sad that our legal system lacks a sense of proportionality for crimes. 35 years is what someone would get for murder, rape, or dealing drugs - not for stealing property, and then giving it back.

To borrow his example, there is probably not going to be a second date between a man who is passionate about ""LGBT issues"" and a woman who reads books on ""the homosexual agenda"".<p>You adjust your ""tag"" based on your ideal date. If you tag yourself in a narrow way on some attribute (ethnicity, profession, interests, whatever), it means you do not want to be found through searches on that attribute, <i>except</i> by people who use that exact term. But you DO consider that attribute important enough that you want to send information about it to people who found you through searches on <i>other</i> attributes.<p>And on the other hand, you may provide a very broad tag for ""ethnicity"" (e.g. ""Black"", ""Asian"", etc.). That means you <i>want</i> to be found by people who search using those very broad terms. And on the gripping hand, some users may choose NOT to provide a tag for their ethnicity. Their ethnicity may be reasonably obvious from their photo, but their failure to provide a tag also sends a signal --- namely that they don't want to found by the kinds of people who search based on ethnic/racial background, and would resent being set up on a date with them.<p>Basically, free text allows not only for signalling about one's race/ethnicity, but ""meta-signalling"" about how important you think race/ethnicity should be on a dating site. Satisfies a lot more use-cases than a drop-down field which requires you to fill it out.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.shirky.com/writings/ontology_overrated.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.shirky.com/writings/ontology_overrated.html</a>",1268016721

Also, even if you <i>do</i> get a job, working on your startup part-time is yet harder. Valley jobs typically take much more than full-time hours and have little time off. Welcome to the USA.<p>Also, you haven't really defined what your goals are, other than just being in SF and working on a prototype. Without the motivation of being in a program like Y Combinator (not to mention all the introductions and networking they can arrange) this doesn't sound like a great plan to me. If you want to sprint for a prototype in some cheap apartment, you can do that anywhere.<p>I'd advise you to do this instead.<p>1) You seem to want to soak up SF & Valley culture, so do that first.<p>- Get an internship at one of the better companies, ideally Google<p>- Participate in one of Google's Summer of Code projects.<p>- Visit SF on a tourist visa and just hang out. Meet a lot of people in the hacker and startup scene.<p>Then:<p>2) Invigorated with all these new ideas and contacts, go home, get some partners, and work on the prototype.<p>You may not appreciate how much simpler this is right now, but you will if you try to live here for a short while. You can probably even live with your parents, since you're so young. Or go to one of the cheaper European countries, and hack by day, enjoy yourself by night. You're only young once so why not do it in style? It's called the <i>World</i> Wide Web for a reason.<p>3) <i>IF</i> you think you're picking up momentum then try to find people who can bring you into the USA again. Hopefully you will have met enough people in stage 1 to do this.<p>P.S. There are a few tricks out there to establish an American startup with non-American workers, but they are very high risk. Even if the INS buys it, you will end up signing most of your rights over to someone American.

Don't just randomly interject with ""oh by the way, go buy Product X!"", but if Product X is a brand of hard drive and you're writing about hard drives, take a sentence or two to talk about the advantages of that particular brand. In plain text, just like the rest of your article.<p>There are TWO important parts to this equation. Many people only seem to realize the first.\n1) Make your ads not so obvious that machines can tell they're ads.\n2) Make your ads not so annoying that people will update their ad blocking rules to remove them.<p>In other words, working around the ad blocker to present annoying ads is just going to annoy even further. Your ads have to be seen AND they have to not be immediately blocked again and/or just ignored, and that means they have to be manually inserted so that they are intertwined with the content from both a technical and a writing standpoint.<p>You might even get away with static banners, that don't stand out too much, at the top and bottom of a page (where we can scroll it off the screen), and text links next to the content area. Just not IN the articles, unless it's part OF the article.<p>Why did I install an ad blocker in the first place? Because ages ago on gameshark.com, an ad popped up, demanding I join the US Army. I've never left Canada and I was maybe 13 at the time. This ad, for 30 seconds, played an animation with loud sound effects, hogging up all my CPU time and bandwidth (now I knew why the page had loaded so slow), and centred itself under the mouse cursor at all times so I couldn't click anything. It was a Flash layer of some sort, rather than a window, so no keyboard shortcut would be able to do anything either.\nWhen this ad finally disappeared, I IMMEDIATELY looked up and installed an ad blocker, and never again went to gameshark.com. If I'd had any interest whatsoever in joining the US Army, that also would have killed it permanently.\nThis is the perfect example of how to do EVERYTHING WRONG with online advertising.<p>PS: one of the worst comment systems I've ever seen.

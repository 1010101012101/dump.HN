(They've since price dropped to ~$169)<p>- 3DS appears to be a mere Nintendo DS 0.5 update until you actually experience the 3D in person.<p>- Weak 3DS games.<p>- Nintendo got over protective parents concerned by stating themselves that young kids (Nintendo's core market) shouldn't play the device.<p>- The Wii is dead.<p>The iOS platform is popular but we have to consider how many of the folks engaging in iOS gaming were likely to buy a 3DS in the first place. I'm not convinced yet that we're seeing a mass switch over. I think Nintendo does have to treat this competition very seriously, but I think some of the other points I listed above have had a larger negative impact on the 3DS and Nintendo's recent performance than the rise of iOS gaming.",1319731183

If you are the first person to sign on for that program, you would have to type in the details so others could follow it. use some sort of averging equation to cancel out the early tappers and the late tappers. no need to mess with synching scheduling data, the users do all the work. offer some incentive for those that inform the rest of the users that the commercial break is over. it's a dopey idea.",1319731155

Granted, I work with an app that is on these leader boards but it wasn't always that way.<p>We started out having maybe 5-60 downloads a week for quite some time (1+ years). Now, we're at several thousand downloads per week and have been for the past several months. From the surveys we've done we've found at most about 5% stumbled upon our app and used it because they saw us in the app store. The rest? from continued press, advertising and word of mouth about what we are providing and how our app adds value to a users phone/life.<p>The reason why apps get to the top is because usually they're providing something novel, or at a minimum, provide something that no one else does well. It's something that happens in every industry. Are you really filling a need of someone other than you? Are you doing it better than the competition? (UI, Design and so on) Are you listening to your customers? There are exceptions, no doubt, but if you're building a killer product and advertise it elsewhere, I do think you too can make it.<p>With all of that being said, is the app I work on perfect? not in the least bit, but we're continually improving it, making our customers happier with each revision. (And when we don't, we act quickly) The list of todos for our app is 10x longer than what is done, but that's because we see so much potential. Is our app better than our competitors? certainly, our reviews, # of downloads and so on show it.",1319731133

If you speak at conferences, especially about a non-technical subject like ""women in FOSS projects"" (which is more likely to get sexists riled up), you are going to get unwanted attention. Pretty much every speaker who speaks on a controversial, or non-technical, or just media-glamorized topic is going to get harassed - if not hacked. It happens all the time <i>to men</i> and i'm sure it happens to women.<p>2. She started a ""geek feminist"" website, so that didn't help in terms of getting some sexist asshole's attention. It's like starting a ""geek black people"" website and not expecting white supremacists to send hate mail. I'm not saying it's justified, only that you have to expect the assholes out there will come out of the woodwork to give you shit.<p>3. <i>I need to do something that feels rewarding and fun, and the work I was doing - which involved lots of speaking at conferences wasnt giving me that any more.</i> - So stop speaking at conferences? The tech industry has more going for it than giving talks.<p>4. If the guy isn't posing a physical threat, suck it up and <i>ignore it</i>. Do you know how many people troll me every week? A lot. But I make myself a target - just like being bullied in school - and thus I need to defend myself or move on.<p>5. Stop trying to 'get more women in technology'. Why is this seen as a serious problem that needs fixing? Go ahead and work to reduce sexism, I think that's necessary because the internet tends to reduce everything to childish unprofessional behavior. But nobody's code is going to get better just because there's more females working on it. Instead, focus on improving the tech industry as a whole instead of one little facet of it (like the distribution of gender).<p>I'm sorry if I sound unsympathetic. I do sympathize. A friend of mine stopped working in the underground infosec community because he was putting out a magazine and people were sending him hate mail. I understand he didn't want to get shit, but he had to expect haters - it's the fucking internet.",1319728793

Windows XP might be 10 years old, but it went through 3 major service packs that plugged many security holes, upgraded many frameworks and libraries, etc. Visually XP SP3 might not be different from the first Windows XP version, but under the hood, a lot has been fixed or upgraded. If I remember correctly, XP is still getting security updates to this date.",1319727813

It's definitely possible to write a C-to-C compiler that supports parts of Apple's syntax (e.g. ""oneFrom = ^(int anInt) { return  anInt - 1; };""), just by replacing every ^ by a function pointer to a function defined at the end of the current file.<p>Of course, blocks is much more than that (e.g. includes memory management), and there <i>is</i> a reason for that...",1319727748

This would correspond to increased per-capita wealth consumption.<p>However the fact that you must choose four of {decrease excess wealth, decrease employment, maintain moderate per-capita consumption, maintain high per-capita work output, maintain high per-hour work output} is a logical truth.<p>Proof:<p>Wealth can be created (work), destroyed (consumed), or accumulated and held (income/wealth inequality).  Wealth <i>must</i> be created at the same rate it is accumulated or destroyed (i.e. Wc = Wa + Wd).  Since OWS wants to decrease wealth accumulated and it is undesirable to increase wealth destroyed (unless in the example given above), we must therefore decrease wealth created.  Right now this is happening due to unemployment.  Since OWS also wants to minimize that, we must decrease wealth created in another manner.  Obviously, decreasing wealth created per hour worked is out of the question (that would mean reverting to a pre-industrial age).  The only remaining option is to decrease hours worked.

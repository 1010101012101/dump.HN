144638,comment,144390,144390,0,0,mechanical_fish,,,"I'm not convinced that this ""less interesting"" problem is real.<p>For one thing, talking about the ""quality"" of news.yc posts is like talking about the weather. It's partially random, and it fluctuates. Sometimes it's grey and drizzly! Sometimes it's sunny! Sometimes you have Hurricane Katrina!<p>There certainly are lots of people complaining about the quality of posts, but that in itself isn't evidence of anything. People constantly talk about the weather, too. It's a safe topic, it's a shared experience that connects you with your audience (""Did you get wet yesterday? Yeah, I got wet, too!""), and it changes a lot, which guarantees that there will always be something to say.<p>Any community larger than five will never agree on the definition of an ""on topic"" submission. One person's sensationalist linkbait is another's clever marketing hook. One person's banal retread is another's timeless classic.<p>Finally, I don't think we need another system. We have a system: PG edits the site using whatever tools that come to hand. (Yes, the karma system is there, too, but it's kind of lightweight -- karma does not convey ultimate power, it's subtle in its influence, and it mostly serves as a way to send small-scale social signals.) Ultimately, I don't trust systems to build readable sites: I trust editors. I'm confident that, if the site starts to suck, PG will start arbitrarily pruning and transplanting and reworking the rules until it doesn't suck anymore. I certainly trust him more than I'll ever trust any mindless, gameable, automatic system, or any silver-bullet gimmick.",1206373937

The statistical data supports my point.<p><a href=""http://www.economicmobility.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.economicmobility.org/</a><p><i>>>People who start out with wealth seldom create wealth.

My Ferrari metaphor is more about having the repertoire of values and skills needed to become wealthy in a place like the U.S. rather than simply being endowed with money.  You're vastly more likely to do well in life if you have parents who spend time with you teaching you to read, making sure you do your homework, provide emotional support, and instill values of hard work and success than you are if you have parents, a parent, or no parents who do none of those things.<p>The late John Ogbu studied why the children of affluent African American parents who went to excellent schools were much more likely to underperform academically relative to their peers, and discovered that parental disengagement was a major factor.<p><a href=""http://www.hepg.org/her/abstract/38"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.hepg.org/her/abstract/38</a><p>Sometimes people manage to acquire the necessary values and thus the skills necessary to do well, despite starting off in adverse conditions.  But they're the exceptions, and were psychologically and sociologically positioned to be that way.  So unfortunately they can't be used as examples demonstrating that ""anybody"" can overcome adversity.<p><i>>>Slavery and poverty are different economic relationships altogether.

144596,comment,144321,144321,0,0,1gor,,,"The question is not what creates wealth but what keeps it unevenly distributed.<p>There have been experiments (computer simulations) that tried to explain 'Pareto distribution' -- a power law distribution of wealth leading to 20 percent of population having 80% of the wealth. I refer to 1996 Axtell and Epstein book (google for Sugarcape).<p>Basically, they created a number of software 'agents' and placed them on a landscape full of resources. Each agent possessed a 'fitness function' that controlled its further survival. Having access to resources improved the fitness function since the agent could replenish its energy and could go on hunting for resources having some surplus for the rainy day.<p>What transpired from the simulation is that 'the Rich get Richer' axiom is basically true. First generation agent might have stumbled on a resource nearby by accident. It has improved its fitness function and he was able to successfully compete on the next round.<p>Meanwhile similarly fit agent who had bad luck in the first round (no resource nearby) was left chronically under-fit and his chances of 'making it to the top' diminished with every round.<p>This piece of empirical knowledge makes two important points about the society and the wealth.<p>Firstly, even in the free market society people always have unequal opportunities because this is an emergent quality of the system, not the result of some corruption, inability, personal passivity etc. The best and the brightest will stay poor unless they stumble on a resource which is not taken. (A new internet business idea for example).<p>Secondly, revolutions have their merits. They re-shuffle fitness landscape.  Even when people do not directly 'expropriate' somebody's wealth by simply levelling the playing field revolutions create competing chances for the talented and the hard-working who would otherwise be forever destined to be relatively unfit comparing to those who already have access to resources.<p>Looks like extreme pro-market views are as primitive as extreme 'left' views.

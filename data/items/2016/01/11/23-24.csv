The troll doesn&#x27;t want to and generally can&#x27;t participate in the lengthy discussion.<p>So my proposed social media site works in two ways:<p>1) Stories are segmented into expected level of complexity. Eg, there is a twitter version of a story, a short paragraph version of story, an article version of story, and an extensive version with citations version of story. Any user can access whichever level they choose at any time... but...<p>2) Posting, instead of arbitrary points which tend to be about liking vs disliking arguments despite things like reddiquette, is about two factors.. quality of comment (upvotes but no downvotes for comment quality) and logical strength regardless of position, handed out in a slashdot style random mod distribution to those who opt in to participate in logical analysis of comments...<p>Users all start with limited commenting and submission capabilities. As a user shows they are adding value though, they get more priviledges, and conversely, as trolls troll, they get temp and perma-bans based on level. (so a troll can still troll the twitter level comments, but not the citation level comments)<p>What do you think about a system like this, or do you have any other ideas on how to defeat this kind of warping of the social media world without excluding the users who just want to make pun threads all day?<p>The bottom line is that I want a way to encourage and reward logical and rational discussion and debate for all levels of users, but allow users who wish to remain stagnant to at least participate in the way they so desire.",1452556153

Now, I have not read all that much philosophy in-depth, precisely because so much of it seems divorced from everyday reality and because so much of it is filled with enough jargon that one must already be on the path to becoming an academic philosopher to get much out of it.  With James, on the other hand, I&#x27;ve found that whenever I disagree with him (which admittedly is not too often) I can always point to exactly where my thinking diverges from his, and why.<p>The following quotes from the article very much reminded me of what I like about him:<p>> Philosophy, understood as the love of wisdom, was seen as a vocation, like the priesthood. It required significant moral virtues (foremost among these were integrity and selflessness), and the pursuit of wisdom in turn further inculcated those virtues. The study of philosophy elevated those who pursued it. Knowing and being good were intimately linked. It was widely understood that the point of philosophy was to become good rather than simply to collect or produce knowledge.<p>> Our claim, then, can be put simply: Philosophy should never have been purified. Rather than being seen as a problem, “dirty hands” should have been understood as the native condition of philosophic thought — present everywhere, often interstitial, essentially interdisciplinary and transdisciplinary in nature. Philosophy is a mangle. The philosopher’s hands were never clean and were never meant to be.<p>I have heard James referred to as the last philosopher who thought that philosophy was something practical that everybody ought to consider in daily life.  Not in a pop-psych sense where complex things were oversimplified into one weird trick, but in the sense of putting thought into the actions that one takes, paying attention to the habits and attitudes that one cultivates.<p>I take the opposite perspective to the one found in your comment.  There were certainly philosophers of James&#x27;s time and before who were deliberately obscure and slippery, but there&#x27;s no way for most of us to tell if their modern-day counterparts are behaving as badly because the terminology and its underlying concepts are so formidable.  They may have been hammered out in the pursuit of clarity--though I am skeptical about this--but the effect is the same as building a brick wall to keep out the layman.  I will not even say that it does not have its place, but I think it&#x27;s a shame that the entire field is so specialized.  It&#x27;s as if everyone were required to be a mechanic in order to drive a car.  That is something that makes sense when a field is new, not as it matures.",1452555007

10884446,comment,10877500,10878401,0,0,p4wnc6,,,"> Searle uses a lookup table argument in the chinese room.<p>I know that. I was asking about your claim that a lookup table can be Turing complete, as opposed to merely able to pass a given Turing test. A lookup table does not express universal computation, at least not on its own. For instance, you couldn&#x27;t use a fixed-size lookup table (with fixed, immutable content) to express some floating point number of precision N, where N is so high that even just the bits required to represent it outnumbers the available space in the lookup table. You&#x27;d need something &quot;outside of&quot; the lookup table that could mutate its memory, or hold state of its own while reading from the lookup table. The complexity class of doing any of this would be irrelevant to Turing <i>completeness</i>.<p>On the topic of the complexity threshold for sentience, I think the reasons are extremely simple and obvious. If you take a Turing test to involve convincing a human being of something (as it was originally conceived), then there are inherent time constraints to performing actions. If you can adequately respond to any question posed in English, but it takes you longer than the age of the universe to do so, then as far as anyone is concerned, you <i>actually can&#x27;t</i> do it.<p>Imagine that one day we create an artificial being which we all agree is sentient. Suppose, without being too precise, that the entity &quot;runs&quot; in some amount of time -- like it can answer verbal questions in matters of minutes, it can solve complicated problems in matters of hours or days, and so on.<p>Now suppose we can play around with the insides of that being and we have some sort of dial that lets us &quot;slow it down.&quot; We click the dial once, and the being now takes hours to make verbal responses, and takes weeks to solve complex problems. We click the dial again and it takes weeks to make a verbal response, and months to solve a complex problems... and so on.<p>I think it is reasonable to believe that after enough clicks the entity <i>is not sentient</i> even if the underlying software is conceptually similar and just differs by controlling its complexity class.<p>I&#x27;m not saying I agree that this definitely defines sentience. I&#x27;m just saying it&#x27;s extremely reasonable that <i>it might</i> and it&#x27;s not at all obvious to me that an exponentially slow entity, <i>if we could wait long enough to verify</i>, is &quot;just as sentient&quot; as an entity that is verifiably more efficient.<p>Even further, the particular argument that I pointed out actually used estimated numbers to come up with <i>space</i> bounds, <i></i>not<i></i> time bounds. Basically, the argument was that even if you truncate to considering <i>merely</i> 5-minute-long English conversations (or shorter), then creating a lookup table to be able to look up responses is <i>physically</i> impossible -- who even cares how long it would take to actually <i>use</i> it if you could create it -- you can&#x27;t even create it, and so it is somewhat fallacious to even begin a thought experiment by saying &quot;suppose there is this big lookup table that physics logically excludes from possibility.&quot; It&#x27;s just not even useful, <i>not even as a thought experiment, because it doesn&#x27;t speak about what is possible, from first principles.</i>",1452554821

For the most recent example - someone made a raspberry Pi controlled insulin pump. Insulin is actually incredibly dangerous to humans if you get the dose wrong, so making an insulin pump based on hardware that does not conform with highest safety standards is just not acceptable. You know what the person behind it said when it was pointed out to them? That it doesn&#x27;t matter, because raspberry Pi is still going to kill less people than the number of those who die through incorrect injections due to tiredness or simple mistakes. That&#x27;s absolutely incorrect - even if such machine lowered the overall number of deaths due to incorrect insulin injections, no one would ever allow it on any market ever. No company would ever get its way out of &quot;poor hardware choice lead to death of Mr. Smith&quot; by saying &quot;hey, but actually, our machine kills less people than would die naturally due to similar causes each year, so you can&#x27;t hold us accountable, right??&quot;.<p>To me, it&#x27;s the same with automatic cars - they cannot merely &quot;have less accidents than humans&quot;. They need to have 0 accidents or they won&#x27;t be acceptable. That&#x27;s why the bar is high. If you are in a situation where a choice is between hitting a pedestrian or running under a semi and possibly killing everyone in your car, no one is going to blame you for doing either - our primitive brains probably are going to go with whatever seems most logical at the moment, you can blame anything on adrenaline. Computers don&#x27;t have that luxury. They need to make a calculated choice - and then whoever makes them(the computers) has to live with that choice. The computer chose to hit the pedestrian - now the company who wrote its code is being sued for millions - no matter how they frame it, that&#x27;s not a situation anyone wants to be in. Of course I&#x27;m going off into theoreticals here, since we don&#x27;t actually have this problem yet.

Use parking garage app to find the best balance between distance and price of parking for the time needed.\nAs far as determining if the garage is full, many garages have sensors now that count how many open spaces there are. It would not be stretch to assume that by the time autonomous cars are ready, this data will be available within the parking apps.<p>c. One of the cool things about having a computer make these decisions is that it can factor in a limitless amount of data to make the most efficient decision.

This raises the question, how do you know that statement is true?  On that view, you can only reasonably say, &quot;I&#x27;ve assumed it.&quot;  The belief that all knowledge is based on assumptions is just a rephrasing of the postmodern view that there is no objective truth (is that true?).<p>I don&#x27;t want to sound like I&#x27;m attacking you here, but our beliefs about knowledge and truth are very consequential.  If we cannot know anything aside from our assumptions, then all assumptions are equally valid (since we can&#x27;t know which to discard).  This naturally leads to situations where, e.g., racism is assumed to be good by one person, assumed to be bad by another, and there is no way we can determine who&#x27;s right.  In fact, &quot;right&quot; and &quot;wrong&quot; become meaningless because they&#x27;re only assumptions, as does all language.",1452553360

On 6 May 1949 the EDSAC in Cambridge ran its first program, making it arguably &quot;the first complete and fully operational regular electronic digital stored-program computer&quot;.[18] It is sometimes claimed that the IBM SSEC, operational in January 1948, was the first stored-program computer;[19] this claim is controversial, not least because of the hierarchical memory system of the SSEC, and because some aspects of its operations, like access to relays or tape drives, were determined by plugging.[20] \n&quot;&quot;&quot;<p><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stored-program_computer"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stored-program_computer</a>",1452553284

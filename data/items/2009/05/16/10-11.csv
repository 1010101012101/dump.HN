Specifically, I found that even though my wife was a reasonable person and our split fairly amicable (as much as these things can be) that I wasn't necessarily off the hook for alimony. According to my understanding of California law, the judge can look at my divorce case and if he thinks my ex's income is too low compared to the mine then he can award her alimony <i>even though it was not requested by her</i>.<p>That opened my eyes and I saw pre-nups in a new light: They are just writing your own personal divorce laws so that you can be sure they are ""fair"" in your own eyes--They are not a sign of distrust.<p>It's like signing a confidentiality agreement in business. One party isn't assuming you're going to break the agreement, they're just spelling out the terms so everything is on the table.",1242471172

612079,story,,,5,11,mojuba,"Can HN make the leaders page more useful by showing average karma per comment?",,"I think total karma says nothing but total time and effort spent on HN, which rather speaks negatively about the person. On the other hand, someone who joined later may turn out to be a more valuable contributor.<p>Two suggestions on making this calculation (average karma) easier and more or less meaningful:  (1) I think it would be OK to just store monthly averages to avoid needing to go through all historical data. An average of monthly averages for, say, last 6 months can do the job pretty nicely and in any case is more interesting than total karma. (2) Showing up in the leaders chart can be triggered only after certain amount of comments made, say 50.<p>Should submission karma be included? I don't know. Honestly, in terms of merits your submission karma says very little about you, unless you submit your own articles, of course. But then, just be clever in the comments.<p>I'd expect the effect of this change to be even more interesting discussions and probably less uninteresting and unstimulating one-liner remarks here and there.",1242470861

Just because you understand how the low level works doesn't mean you keep it loaded in your working memory simultaneously to the high-level knowledge.

612074,comment,610896,610896,0,0,Tichy,,,"Why did it never occur to them to just sell the house? That is what puzzles me most (among other things). It seems that having your own house is so important as a status symbol that all other concerns are minuscule in comparison?<p>Also, what happens if the bank you borrowed the money from goes bankrupt? Is there a chance they will just get to keep the house, because nobody will ever come round to claim the money? If so, it wouldn't be so bad after all...",1242469181
612073,comment,611115,611679,0,0,andrewljohnson,,,"If you aren't yet treating the community like they will aggressively abuse and spam the system, I think you should start.<p>Are you looking at any other information about how this story got voted up so fast? I haven't looked at the HN code at all, but I wonder if there is anything sophisticated for stopping people from colluding and spamming. Do these accounts come from the same geographic area? ISP? Do they vote like each other in the past?<p>Vote-weighting doesn't even really seem like it's going to be the solution to the problem. Well, it might end up being the solution if you give a great deal of weight to trusted accounts, but you might in the end discourage new users from contributing.<p>I think maybe you consider attacking spammers head on. I really don't think the problem is a bunch of newbies up-voted this story. HN is just easy to game.",1242469166

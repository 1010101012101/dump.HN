Tapes have only been truly obsolete for a few years now, for sufficiently large amounts of data.  If you're Walmart's DBA and already have millions invested in hardware, those algorithms could come in handy :-).",1187769325
45139,comment,45074,45074,0,0,trekker7,,,"I think this is true of startups in general... most startups fail right? The reason why people pick on Web 2.0 in particular is because (a) it's the current trend and (b) it's a lot easier to launch a website than sell enterprise software packaged as CDs, so there may be a lot more Web 2.0 startups out there.",1187768690
45138,comment,45082,45082,0,0,davidw,,,"All the suggested computer books are pretty good, but you'll bump into those sooner or later if you're looking.  You can't avoid them.<p>What' I'd recommend, in addition to those, are some mind-broadening books that give you some ideas about other disciplines.  I'm particularly interested in economics, because that's very important for understanding the whys and hows of the market.  If you just want one recommendation, ""Information Rules"" is a good one.<p>I summarized a bunch of books I like here:<p><a href=""http://www.squeezedbooks.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.squeezedbooks.com</a><p>In particular, others that I would recommend:<p>- Crossing the Chasm <p>- In Search of Stupidity: Over Twenty Years of High Tech Marketing Disasters<p>- The Innovator's Dilemma",1187768554

45134,comment,45082,45097,0,0,jey,,,"> <i>The Art of Computer Programming, by Knuth</i><p>Too dense and theoretical, even for someone who enjoys it. Introduction to Algorithms by Cormen, Leiserston, Rivest and Stein is more understandable and practical. It does cover everything useful and is thorough, it just isn't pedantic. [1] <a href=""http://tinyurl.com/yr257c"" rel=""nofollow"">http://tinyurl.com/yr257c</a><p>> <i>Compilers: Principles, Techniques, and Tools by Aho, Sethi, and Ullman (the dragon book)</i><p><i>Maybe</i>. You might want to try Engineering a Compiler by Cooper and Torczon instead. Again, it's more practical/useful/interesting. But if you're dying to write a parser generator, go ahead and read the Dragon Book. <a href=""http://tinyurl.com/ys3ql7"" rel=""nofollow"">http://tinyurl.com/ys3ql7</a><p>> <i>Structure & Interpretation of Computer Programs, by Abelson and Sussman</i><p>Available for free: <a href=""http://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/full-text/book/book.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/full-text/book/book.html</a><p>Dunno about the databases book, but the rest are also good.<p>1.

45133,comment,45104,45128,0,0,mmaunder,,,"Thanks. A while back I was playing with a ramdisk on linux and syncing the data to non-volatile storage. That worked quite well. I can't use that in this case because there are lots of tiny files and they occupy too much space for ramdisk. But looking at the output of vmstat, it looks like there isn't much disk io, so I think the linux filesystem cache is working quite well.\n",1187767635

45128,comment,45104,45104,0,0,palish,,,"Congrats.  It seems like the main bottleneck of webapps is the on-disk database.  I'd say that if your app is small enough you shouldn't even start with a database, but that would be a preoptimization.",1187766441
45127,comment,45076,45106,0,0,dfranke,,,"No, it started along the same lines as this, but would then also allow you to make changes to your schema, generate the appropriate ALTER TABLE commands, and then generate views for backward compatibility so that queries already written for the old schema will keep working.  Also I just planned to do it as a desktop application since there's not really any aspect to this that benefits from being web-based.<p>I did some post-submission brainstorming with Paul, though, and the idea morphed into a DBMS desgined to run on S3.",1187766032

A great synthesis by two lifelong historians on what can be learned from a study of history. Covers human nature, society, culture/morals and many other important topics and takes as objective a view as possible.<p>You can listen to it over and over and get some great insights. Dense, but easy to listen to. There is one small section that is slightly dated and shows that they were writers in their own time but most of it is timeless.<p>I highly recommend this. It will really give you insight into our world.",1210976612

It's no match, however, for the community around Textmate that provides all sorts of bundles and snippets that may come in handy (and most of which you will never ever use).<p>For example, if a new web application framework comes out tomorrow, you can be fairly sure someone will create a Textmate bundle for it the day after.

Also, personal and company goods are different as well, since one uses them for profit and the other does not.<p>In my company I assume most users will use the open source version, I assume a few will trickle into the commercial side.  Of those, some might pirate, but I don't focus on those.  I focus on making money and building a better product and providing value for paying customers.  We've been around for over 7 years now, so it seems to be working too.<p>But yes, I do lock my door.  Mainly because I work from home, so it's also my office.

I started out as a windows user using pirated copies in india... this discouraged me from using linux for quite some time, as we used to have phone modems and bandwidth was pathetic... one day i got a mandrake linux cd with a magazine... it was great fun using it, but gnome sucked then, but now i prefer linux over windows. so for windows at least, side-1 did not have any benefits. in fact, windows helped me start using computers and i 'converted' to linux!<p>i had another question:
suppose a person cannot check out a book from a library (copy is out), so he downloads an ebook off the net and reads it, then deletes the copy as soon as he obtains the copy from the library.... so what effect did this 'piracy' have on the book producer? the book is <i>quite</i> old and i doubt whether the author (hint: amoeba) would be getting any big royalties on the book....",1210975413

192267,comment,191721,191721,0,0,gills,,,"Maybe.  Here is my opinion.<p>The poor need goods and services just like the rest of us.  More to the point of the article, they also require credit and some faith in their productivity, to even attempt to rise out of their situation.<p>Theoretically, an efficient market will help provide credit to the poor people most able to use it in a productive manner.  In reality, it seems like things get a little non-linear below the poverty line.  By definition, those in poverty can't reach up to meet the price of goods (including credit) in the general market.  Also by definition, a market exists only when buyer and seller reach a mutually beneficial agreement.  So it seems that when those who are not poor are dealing with the poor, they are not acting as rational market participants because they may not reach a mutually beneficial equilibrium.  Who would even try?  I think this is why micro-finance needs to be a somewhat humanitarian effort.<p>Coincidentally. the economic crisis engulfing the U.S. right now is an example of why profiting from the poor doesn't work (well...without some productivity requirements).  Not lending to <i>the poor</i>, per se, but lending to people who had no chance (and possibly no intention) of using the credit productively and paying it back.  This has partly been due to incentives which are/were outside of the market between lender and borrower -- fees, and a secondary market which was hungry for securitized debt.  The demand in the secondary market was met by trying to do the impossible (lending on bad bets) and selling it off as a package of good bets.<p>This last bit should actually make you upset on many levels.  The U.S. patent office won't accept inventions which violate the laws of thermodynamics, and I'm still confused why the Federal Reserve does...sorry, on a tangent.  Back to the salt mines for me!",1210975233

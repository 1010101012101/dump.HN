I just worked on a website that contained some video (for a children's show TV format), and we did some calculations on what hosting the video would cost.<p>With 50 Mb/video, you can do 20 video's for 1 Gb of traffic. Which, at AWS cost 12 cents. Let's say you'd pay half that at a cheaper CDN, 6 cents. You would, just for transporting the video, need to make 6/20=0.3 cents/page. That's $3 CPM, which seems high. And this is only for transporting the video, not the other infrastructure needed. Not so sure that's a winning business-model.<p>To be fair, we also looked into setting up our own servers, some places have a few TB traffic with a $50 VPS, but than you need a lot more sysadmin work.",1355227178

In either case, someone who enjoys hacking things will hack it (and the more difficult to hack the more enjoyment and so more likely to be hacked). Once a single person cracks a piece of software, they can upload it to tpb or similar and now everyone has it cracked.<p>So keeping the hacks as easy as possible with as minimal impact to paying customers is the correct way to do it. Having it be a little text file you edit that flags something as bought or not is the perfect way, as support can easily instruct users with difficulties to flip the switch themselves.<p>Making it difficult doesn't help anybody - people who want to pirate WILL download a pirated torrent. Don't give them reason to do this by making your version of the game worse than the pirated copy!! NB!!",1355227163

4904168,comment,4902960,4904080,4,0,laumars,,,"""Using a 3rd party website (or your own), you are unlikely to get the exposure of an app store or a telco portal.""<p>I don't agree with that either as most app store-published applications get next to no exposure anyway. That privilege is reserved for a very few that either pay for promotion or go viral. So you're back to the old model of users either searching for a specific application to suit their needs (search engines existed before app stores) or ""word of mouth"" (which these days include forums / blogs and all of those existed prior to app stores as well).<p>There is this misconception among some (and I'm by no means saying that you're under the same illusion) that developers only need to upload to Apples App Store or Google Play and they'll see thousands of downloads and ""PROFIT"" (to quote a meme). The reality is the vast majority of apps do not make any money and uploading to central repositories does not mean people will stumble across your application or game. And what's more, anything you do upload is not only subject to the same limitations of users stumbling upon your product as before, but with the influx of new developers sold on this rose-tinted vision, you're now competing with significantly more software than ever before. So just the additional signal-to-noise ratio alone makes it harder than ever to make your application visible.<p>So I really don't believe the notion that app stores increase exposure for the average developer.<p>Where app stores excel is making content easier to find and install for the average user; one search interface with inbuilt download and install functions. That's a huge step up from Googling from your PC, downloading then either manually copying the .jar to your phone or installing an EXE locally on your PC with your handset connected via activesync. However I wouldn't say that user convenience guarantees developer visibility.",1355226937

In that case, he was not trying to pretend that three singular cases were representative of a trend.<p>> False data is still data isn't it.<p>No, it is not. Data has to come from reality. False data does not.<p>> Many fields use self-reports as a central part of their data gathering.<p>Yup. And then they recognize the potential errors this can introduce and have systematized ways of reducing them. For instance, surveys and questionnaires have to be carefully designed so that the self-report actually reports what we want them to report, and can be usefully synthesized into numerical data. Interviews are distilled into impressions and discussed or replayed with a colleague to mitigate bias. Repeatability makes sampling errors harder to remain hidden. Methodologies are written up with exacting detail so that they can be scrutinized and criticized when there's any doubt.<p>Over and over, they <i>make up</i> for the problem of anecdote and <i>readily admit</i> that their data can be faulty if an assumption is not recognized and accounted for.<p>> The worth of particular data needs to be understood, for sure, but this chastising of people presenting anecdotal information needs to be reined in IMO.<p>I am going to chastise people who pretend that their single cases have wider implications than the specific case they cite.

It seems like the steering wheel does turn the front wheel, and the gyros are free to tilt to accommodate hills.

Some people are straight, some are gay. Straights should act a little gay, or gays should try to be straight to minimize differences?<p>Minimizing differences is not the objective, embracing differences is.",1355223821

4904040,comment,4901849,4902428,3,0,drostie,,,"Just to give a little more context, because I think this gripe is very common:<p>There exists a proof that NAND gates are all you ever need to compute an arbitrary boolean function from M bits to N bits. Actually, you also need a ""copy"" gate -- the ability to generate two bits with value X from one bit with value X -- and ""wires"" to communicate values from gate to gate, but that's about it.<p>The proof starts out like this: ""a function from M bits to N bits is actually just N functions from M bits to 1 bit, as long as I can copy the input N times and feed it to the N functions which compute each output bit. So if I solve the problem for M-to-1, I automatically solve M-to-N as long as I have COPY and SWAP gates.""<p>It's very important to see that the <i>exact same approach</i> is being used in the P-vs-NP question. P and NP are designed to be about functions which take M bits to 1 bit, hence they are ""decision problems"" with a boolean output but a variable input.<p>The question ""P = NP?"" can also be phrased more common-sensically, if not totally precisely, as ""is brute force ever really necessary?"". What is brute force? It is if you have to try a substantial fraction of the 2^M inputs to find a certain 1-bit output. What does this look like here? Well, that gets more complicated because we use <i>scaling</i> of a problem and a system of solution to discuss what's going on.<p>So a problem is in NP if (1) you can reduce it to some sort of M-bit input to 1-bit output, and (2) there exists some constant number K such that if I double the input size from M to 2M, the circuit has no more than K times the number of gates. This gives the logic circuit a ""polynomial-time"" size.<p>Then a problem is in P if we can find an input which makes the output 1 in a polynomial number of gates as well. Thus this is the ""inverse"" problem, ""find me an input which makes this function 1."" In fact we've just defined what's called a ""satisfiability problem"" -- find an input which satisfies this polynomial-size M-variable boolean formula.<p>A problem is in NP-complete if the recursion holds: if you can implement COPY and NAND and wires in that system in a polynomial number of gates, so that <i>any problem in NP</i> can be written in terms of your problem. This is part of the value of having these ""constant K"" constraints rather than specifying a given K; we get to define these NP-complete cases as the ""hardest cases in NP,"" because if you can reverse them, then you can reverse any other problem in NP.<p>Does that help?",1355223687

There's just so much waste!<p>The byline reads: ""Before you ask for more tax money from me, raise the $2.2 trillion you already collect each year more fairly and spend it more wisely."" This is then supported by a few examples which don't address any of the big entitlement programs necessary for nontrivial tax-reform.<p>2. I pay such a large percent of the taxes!<p>He draws authority from the fact that ""Today, top earners—the 250,000 people who earn $1 million or more—pay 20% of all income taxes, and the 3% who earn more than $200,000 pay almost half. Almost half of all filers pay no income taxes at all. Clearly they earn less and should pay less. But they should pay something and have a stake in our government spending their money too.""<p>This is clearly a less meaningful statistic than percentage of income paid, which was the crux of Buffett's argument.  If I posses say, 90% of the assets in some country X, certainly it doesn't make sense for me to yell, 'hey, I pay like, 60% of the taxes in this place, and all of you Xonian slackers in the bottom 5% are skating by on a free ride.'  It particularly doesn't make sense if, as he proposes, there is no tax on gifting money to your (grand)children, and so perhaps I just inherited the wealth.",1313992714

I think the bar has been raised in terms of how a magazine can justify being a printed magazine. it needs more strengths and ideally takes better advantage of the physical possibilities and experience of the medium. LJ just wasn't doing that. Going all-digital feels like a smart move, because they can get rid of the bathwater (the costs and limiting factors of the printed magazine medium), but keep the baby (what's good about their content and style, and their fanbase.), and, kick it up a notch (take advantage of all the cool things you can do on the web.)

The reason ""designers"" use buzzwords is because it gets small business owners on board with them. Advertising your design services in a cookie cutter, predictable way is OK if you have the portfolio, skills, and actual marketing knowledge to provide business value. I don't care how great your copy or copywriter is, the text and UI has to be seamlessly integrated into the experience so there is NO distraction and the message can be properly conveyed.

Flask let's you program in Python rather than writing to the framework like you typically have to in larger, opinionated framework's like Django and Rails.<p>Ironically, this also makes Flask an ideal choice for advanced Python programmers because it gives you flexibility rather than always wondering ""will the framework allow me to easily do...?""<p>BTW uwsgi is a production app server.

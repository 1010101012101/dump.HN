6268045,comment,6266462,6267573,2,0,pgeorgi,,,"> Don&#x27;t spend money on insurance, spend it on stopping your house burning down.\nOr do both (it&#x27;s funny how IT types love those dichtomies).<p>And if you tell your insurance about your extra measures for fire safety, they likely lower your rates. They might even consult you about which fire safety measures are actually useful (and they have the data: data driven fire safety, how does that sound?).<p>Since fire insurance tends to pay for damage repair when things didn&#x27;t burn to the ground, they&#x27;re also useful in situations that are not as life threatening as your example. We had a warehouse burn down in town, and the neighboring house was affected in that the windows on two sides of the house melted enough to be useless. The cost of replacing all those windows can easily exceed an individual&#x27;s short-term liquidity (a single event might even exceed the rates paid for the insurance over its life-time) - for the insurance that was pocket change.",1377331103

Electric cars aren&#x27;t a silver bullet, but they are a <i>necessary</i> step in order to lower CO2 emissions while keeping our current lifestyle.<p>What I gathered from the text was that, with somewhat pessimistic input numbers, electric cars are more or less on par with gasoline cars. But this is assuming no changes in the power grid, which will be <i>essential</i> if we are really going to transit to a greener economy. Which means more nuclear, hopefully <i>new</i> nuclear, more solar, massively more wind and hopefully less coal during the transition. Note that the Tesla Model S uses few to no rare-earth metals (there are usually employed in the permanent magnet of the motor).<p>But this <i>is</i> sort of a moot point, since properly engineered electric cars appear to be better than their gasoline equivalent, and will eventually sell better regardless.

6268032,comment,6266863,6266863,2,0,sytelus,,,"This is not a problem inherent in stack ranking. <i>Any</i> performance review system that (1) allow unbalanced pay and (2) makes this fact visible to employee, will cause exact same issues. Here unbalanced pay means you want to divide available reward such that higher performing employee gets lions share while those at the tail gets peanuts. Whether you do this through peer reviews or through manager reviews or stack ranking or team level performance or by throwing dice, you will always find some portion of employees feel the system is unjust and they deserve better ratings. Only way to avoid this is by equal bonus pays OR not assigning any ratings at all. For most technology companies at least the option of paying every one equal bonus won&#x27;t be acceptable. It is known fact that highest performing employees perform 5X-20X than lowest performing employees and it would be hard to retain them if they were paid same bonuses as everyone else.<p>However not disclosing ratings could certainly be option. Or you can only disclose binary ratings &quot;Stay/Fire&quot; or trinary rating &quot;Green/Yellow/Red&quot; where they don&#x27;t disclose amount/range of bonus but whether employee performance was sufficient for continuity of employment. People who thought that disclosing bonus indicating ratings was a good idea probably bought on an argument that this will motivate employees to improve themselves to get higher ratings. In reality many aggressive employees actually do work even harder to get back to better ratings however people who have feel lack of opportunity or are rusted eventually settle down with being labeled &quot;average&quot; and pull back on their effort level just to keep employment going.",1377330552

They often create social issues to divert from their own lack of productivity.  What a waste.<p>These folks I&#x27;d definitely not team up with given a second chance.  They are cancer, and the spread can be malignant.<p>(I am not saying let&#x27;s be unsympathetic to the problems of the unproductive folks, but when lack of productivity or competence  is deliberately masked by other fake reasons, it becomes difficult to engage with such folks honestly.

6268013,comment,6259391,6266013,2,0,mtdewcmu,,,"Interesting. I&#x27;m not all that up on philosophy, and I had to look up constructivism and the law of the excluded middle. Computers can only deal directly with discrete math, so that eliminates quite a bit of mathematics. Moreover, despite being regarded as Turing machines, you could in reality count all the states that a computer could be in, by counting the bits of memory, and you will find that it&#x27;s a finite number. So computers are, in fact, only finite state machines. It&#x27;s often overlooked that what makes a Turing machine a Turing machine is the infinitely-long tape. So computers occupy a fairly small sliver of the infinite universe of math.<p>Philosophically, my worldview is like that of science: the way to know something is by making observations and formulating and testing hypotheses. What we can observe is limited, and hypotheses are only models that are tested by successive approximations. I&#x27;m not sure I understand what you mean that that statement isn&#x27;t required to have an ultimate truth. Presumably a statement like that has an answer, but the fact that something is knowable in principle doesn&#x27;t mean that there&#x27;s any way to get the answer. For instance, the Hubble telescope can see far away galaxies that we can never get an up close look at. The question of whether there&#x27;s life somewhere else in the universe must have an answer, but we can&#x27;t know what&#x27;s in those galaxies; even with a better telescope, we&#x27;d be seeing what they looked like a billion years ago.

If a lawyer will sign off on this action in writing then go for it. But I doubt that will happen. Hint: a minor shareholder does not have the right to pre-emptively strike at the company based on the outcome of a lawsuit that still has to be fought. It is very well possible that when the dust settles that you&#x27;ll own the assets of the company but until then this stuff is company property and you as a shareholder are acting against the interests of that company and probably against the terms of your employment contract. That&#x27;s a (very) bad spot to be in and it may very well annul any and all rights that you still have or cause the tide to turn against you from having the moral high-ground to becoming the defendant.",1377328139

6267962,comment,6267887,6267957,23,0,zerohp,,,"It has been revealed today, thanks to Edward Snowden, that Google and other US tech companies received millions of dollars from the NSA for their compliance with the PRISM mass surveillance system.<p>So just how close is Google to the US securitocracy? Back in 2011 I had a meeting with Eric Schmidt, the then Chairman of Google, who came out to see me with three other people while I was under house arrest. You might suppose that coming to see me was gesture that he and the other big boys at Google were secretly on our side: that they support what we at WikiLeaks are struggling for: justice, government transparency, and privacy for individuals. But that would be a false supposition. Their agenda was much more complex, and as we found out, was inextricable from that of the US State Department. The full transcript of our meeting is available online through the WikiLeaks website.<p>The pretext for their visit was that Schmidt was then researching a new book, a banal tome which has since come out as The New Digital Age. My less than enthusiastic review of this book was published in the New York Times in late May of this year. On the back of that book are a series of pre-publication endorsements: Henry Kissinger, Bill Clinton, Madeleine Albright, Michael Hayden (former head of the CIA and NSA) and Tony Blair. Inside the book Henry Kissinger appears once again, this time given pride of place in the acknowledgements.<p>Schmidts book is not about communicating with the public. He is worth $6.1 billion and does not need to sell books. Rather, this book is a mechanism by which Google seeks to project itself into Washington. It shows Washington that Google can be its partner, its geopolitical visionary, who will help Washington see further about Americas interests. And by tying itself to the US state, Google thereby cements its own security, at the expense of all competitors.<p>Two months after my meeting with Eric Schmidt, WikiLeaks had a legal reason to call Hilary Clinton and to document that we were calling her. Its interesting that if you call the front desk of the State Department and ask for Hillary Clinton, you can actually get pretty close, and weve become quite good at this. Anyone who has seen Doctor Strangelove may remember the fantastic scene when Peter Sellers calls the White House from a payphone on the army base and is put on hold as his call gradually moves through the levels. Well WikiLeaks journalist Sarah Harrison, pretending to be my PA, put through our call to the State Department, and like Peter Sellers we started moving through the levels, and eventually we got up to Hillary Clintons senior legal advisor, who said that we would be called back.<p>Shortly afterwards another one of our people, WikiLeaks ambassador Joseph Farrell, received a call back, not from the State Department, but from Lisa Shields, the then girlfriend of Eric Schmidt, who does not formally work for the US State Department. So lets reprise this situation: The Chairman of Googles girlfriend was being used as a back channel for Hillary Clinton. This is illustrative. It shows that at this level of US society, as in other corporate states, it is all musical chairs.<p>That visit from Google while I was under house arrest was, as it turns out, an unofficial visit from the State Department. Just consider the people who accompanied Schmidt on that visit: his girlfriend Lisa Shields, Vice President for Communications at the CFR; Scott Malcolmson, former senior State Department advisor; and Jared Cohen,  advisor to both Hillary Clinton and Condoleezza Rice, a kind of Generation Y Kissinger figure  a noisy Quiet American as the author Graham Greene might have put it.<p>Google started out as part of Californian graduate student culture around San Franciscos Bay Area. But as Google grew it encountered the big bad world. It encountered barriers to its expansion in the form of complex political networks and foreign regulations. So it started doing what big bad American companies do, from Coca Cola to Northrop Grumman. It started leaning heavily on the State Department for support, and by doing so it entered into the Washington DC system. A recently released statistic shows that Google now spends even more money than Lockheed Martin on paid lobbyists in Washington.<p>Jared Cohen was the co-writer of Eric Schmidts book, and his role as the bridge between Google and the State Department speaks volumes about how the US securitocracy works. Cohen used to work directly for the State Department and was a close advisor to both Condolezza Rice and Hillary Clinton. But since 2010 he has been Director of Google Ideas, its in-house think/do tank.<p>Documents published last year by WikiLeaks obtained from the US intelligence contractor Stratfor, show that in 2011 Jared Cohen, then (as he is now) Director of Google Ideas, was off running secret missions to the edge of Iran in Azerbaijan. In these internal emails, Fred Burton, Stratfors Vice President for Intelligence and a former senior State Department official, describes Google as follows:<p>Google is getting WH [White House] and State Dept support and air cover. In reality they are doing things the CIA cannot do[Cohen] is going to get himself kidnapped or killed. Might be the best thing to happen to expose Googles covert role in foaming up-risings, to be blunt. The US Govt can then disavow knowledge and Google is left holding the shit-bag<p>In further internal communication, Burton subsequently clarifies his sources on Cohens activities as Marty Lev, Googles director of security and safety and.. Eric Schmidt.<p>WikiLeaks cables also reveal that previously Cohen, when working for the State Department, was in Afghanistan trying to convince the four major Afghan mobile phone companies to move their antennas onto US military bases. In Lebanon he covertly worked to establish, on behalf of the State Department, an anti-Hezbollah Shia think tank. And  in London? He was offering Bollywood film executives funds to insert anti-extremist content into Bollywood films and promising to connect them to related networks in Hollywood. That is the Director of Google Ideas. Cohen is effectively Googles director of regime change. He is the State Department channeling Silicon Valley.<p>That Google was taking NSA money in exchange for handing over peoples data comes as no surprise. When Google encountered the big bad world, Google itself got big and bad.",1377327789

Mark Shuttleworth was the exception to the rule - if you're not in Silicon Valley you're limiting the odds of success. Anyone else here in Cape Town at the moment?",1190288954

The buttons reflect that clearly. Also, the buttons will use the arrow icon.<p>For iApps (iTunes, iLife, iMac, et. al.) the marketing sites are lighter in color typically now in blue or grey. The buttons, again, reflect that and the use a triangle icon.<p>That said, each product has its own design team (which is why the buttons vary slightly) but everyone reports to a creative director (Apple Support works differently) which then reports to a marketing director so that Apple style guide is observed and the design is consistent. The iApps sites have to have explicit Jobs approval before publishing. <p>The International web team dynamic is also interesting. Prior to publishing, they're flown in from all over the world, put into a meeting room on campus for an entire week prior to some big event. During that time all the sites have to be localized, translated, updated, and approved in tandem to the US launch. ",1190287620

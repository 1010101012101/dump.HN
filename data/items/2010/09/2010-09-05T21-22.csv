1665188,comment,1664807,1664807,0,0,miguelpais,,,"As this snippet doesn't really help a lot to know what A* search actually is, here is the explanation from Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach (from Russel and Norvig):<p><i>The most widely-known form of best-first search is called A-start search (pronounced ""A-star search""). It evaluates nodes by combining g(n) - the cost to reach the node, and h(n) - the cost to get from the node to the goal:</i><p><pre><code>  f(n) = g(n) + h(n)
</code></pre>
<i>Since g(n) gives the path cost from the start node to node n, and h(n) is the estimated cost of the cheapest path from n to the goal, we have</i><p><pre><code>  f(n) = estimated cost of the cheapest solution through n*
</code></pre>
<i>Thus, if we are trying to find the cheapest solution, a reasonable thing to try first is the node with the lowest value of g(n) + h(n). It turns out that this strategy is more than just reasonable: provided that the heuristic function h(n) satisfies certain conditions, K search is both complete and optimal.</i><p><i></i><p>So, for the following graph (tree actually):<p><pre><code>  +---A---+
  |       |
  B h:1   E h:4
  |
  C h:2
  |
  D h:3
</code></pre>
Where the function g(x) is the depth of the node in the tree, and the heuristic function h(x) is presented next to the node (random values), A-star will search for a solution first in the nodes with smaller values of f(n). So a traversal starting at node A will visit nodes in the following order:  {A, B, C, E, D}<p><pre><code>  f(B) = h(B) + g(B) = 1 + 1 = 2
  f(C) = 2 + 2 = 4
  f(E) = 4 + 1 = 5
  f(D) = 3 + 3 = 6
</code></pre>
If there's anything wrong with my explanation please correct me.<p>P.S.: I know my heuristic function is probably not admissible.",1283721252

If you are running scripts to find vulnerable or misconfigured ssh hosts, then it makes sense to scan the standard port and try stupid logins. In that case, if the sysadmin moves ssh to a different port, then they ""protect"" themselves from the various scripts out there, but then again simply having reasonable password policy accomplishes the same thing and without the hassle of having to locate ssh on a different port.<p>On the other hand, if you're a dedicated attacker and you want to compromise a particular system, then moving ssh to another port does squat; nmap will find it easily enough. Port knocking and/or denyhosts and/or iptables or pf will stop that easily enough, but then again, a dedicated attacker probably won't try ssh first anyway, since that's hard. Attacking something else like your web app or any of your other services, would make a lot more sense.<p>So, either way, running ssh on a different port is completely superfluous.

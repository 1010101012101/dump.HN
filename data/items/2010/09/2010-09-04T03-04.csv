The author coins the term ""tiny pony"" to describe the tendency of becoming acclimated to certain exceptional things. ie: There's a pony in the apple store and no one seems to care. Because its always there..<p>Maybe its because we're so focused on ourselves? I still have a regular brick-type cell phone. So its a lot of fun for me to play with an iPhone or iPad whenever I'm at the store, or when my friends let me play with theirs. I always get an urge to buy one - it could totally make my life better (especially mobile internet).<p>But if I buy it, I know the magic will go away. It's particular exceptional-ness will become an expectation, and even a frustration when it doesn't work correctly. And after a certain period, I'd likely refer to it as just another brick-type object, compared with whatever relatively exceptional technology is out then.",1283572652

Nearly everybody I speak with regularly is developing some web based application in Perl. Then again thats what I do for a living so my glasses are definitely rose tinted.<p>Sites like the BBC iPlayer system, and Omni Hotel's booking application are large public examples of Perl applications, Magazines.com is another. At the smaller end of the fence I worked on ParkingMobility.com, a REST system written in Perl with multi-platform clients (including iPhone), was written using Catalyst and the KiokuDB Object Persistence engine.<p>You have moved on, but so has Perl. Moose for example has had heavy influences from OCaml, Scala, CLOS, Smalltalk, and others. It provides anywhere from ""some"" (Moose has Type Constraints but not inferencing for example) to much if not more (Moose's implementation of Traits can provide state unlike Scala's from what I know) of the features of other languages.<p>The rivalry between Perl5 and Perl6 means that more and more of these features will be expressed. For example, I've seen some proof of concept code for implementing Moose's type system at the core language level (my Int $i = 'One'; # boom!). With a properly motivated hacker and the right direction this could turn into an excellent dynamic type system, or even a semi-static system similar to the one Perl6 is implementing. Having this kind of a type system makes lot of Web programming tasks much simpler to implement (and eliminates a whole range of security holes).<p>The current momentum in the community has me very excited for the future of Perl.",1283572165

If you want a full blown SOAP client implementation, including WSDL parsing, you better hope there exists something already.<p>My recommendation, as the developer of a SOAP client/server library; don't bother. Use Java or PHP, as those have the best SOAP libs out there, and figure out a way to pipe SOAP requests through your own java/php ""proxy"" app and let those libs take care of the cruft.<p>Using Node for SOAP is sacrilege.

1661941,comment,1661699,1661699,0,0,kls,,,"From the Article:<p><i>But a mortgage is still a form of long-term forced savings, after all</i><p>No it is not, I don't understand why people cannot get debt and assets straight in their head. A mortgage is a debt, it is theoretical money at some future date. It is resold on the market as an asset when in fact it is not.<p>So here is the deal, If I buy a house today with all cash and the market continues to erode it will eventually devalue other sectors in relation to it. Because a house is a tangible asset and tangible assets have this tricky way of devaluing other hard assets on their way down (eventually). So for instance a house is today worth lets say 15 cars. No matter the dollar amount cars and houses will roughly measure out to the same exchange scale give or take a car.<p>Just as we are seeing now the housing market is threatening to put us into a deflationary spiral. In which other real assets will fall in line with the monetary conversion value of housing. So no matter what the $ amount is, a house will be worth 15 cars give or take a car. As A side note, if you can time the times when they are significantly out of balance you can make some money. It was once said that in the 1800's an ounce of gold would buy you a nice suit and that today and ounce of gold will buy you nice suite. This has held relatively true.<p>OK, so back to my gripe with the article, why is a mortgage not a form of long term savings? Because the mortgage reflects the monetary valuation of an asset at a certain point in time. After that point the monetary valuation of the asset and the mortgage can diverge. The house still has roughly the save value (or will adjust to), just not the same cash value. Mortgages are not written on an index compared to assets so you are exposed to the risk of the asset adjusting while you have a fixed monetary debt instrument.<p>This is why, one should be in an all cash or all asset position depending on the state of the market. In a declining market one should take a cash position and in an inflationary market one should take an asset position. Timing the switch is the trick. Conversely, being on either the owning or receiving end of a debt based security is not the same as being in a cash or real asset position, no matter the direction of the market, but for some reason people confuse this in their mind.<p>Purchasing assets on leverage always exposes you to the risk of adjustment, it therefore cannot be considered a form of savings as there is not a guaranteed return as we have witnessed so clearly as of late. One should always be very cautious when leveraging an asset. They can and do diverge.<p>Not to mention that leverage causes assets to hype-inflate (bubbles) and then many times rapidly deflate once over leveraging happens.",1283571844

If 3D TV had a single standard that content producers could use to create their 3D content, and if consumers could watch it on TVs that required no extra equipment, and if the vast majority of 2D content still looked good on 3D displays, AND if the cost is not prohibitive, then 3D TV will have a shot at thriving in the market.

However, in the event of a divorce, the court will divide up the debts as well as the assets and assign them to both parties.  This is certainly fair for debts that were incurred during the time the couple was married.  Debts incurred before the marriage would be handled like assets brought into the marriage; in general, an effort will be made by the court to restore individuals to their pre-marriage state.<p>That said, marriage is about two people joining their lives together into one, and that means combining your financial lives as well.

I first started following it closely in the first days of its outbreak, because my girlfriend happened to be visiting family just outside Mexico City at the time.<p>Initial reports said that one of the main concerns of H1N1, over ""normal"" influenza strains, was that it seemed to have a greater effect on those with healthy immune systems. At the time, there were some guesses that it might be triggering cytokine ""storms"".<p>Since then, this has been subtly altered to the usual ""most dangerous to the less healthy"" property of normal influenza.<p>I don't really have a point, it's just an observation that's made me go, ""huh.""",1256975474

I'm an introvert myself and believe that people like us 'recharge' through quality time alone.<p>That said, I think it's a real handicap that can be overcome, like any other, by consistently pushing ourselves to go out and be social in some appropriate way, on a regular basis.<p>If you're making something truly cool, I guarantee there are people out there who might not be your target audience, but might know someone who knows someone who is.  You'll never make that connection unless you go out.  It sucks but extroverts have a big advantage in these areas.",1256974987

The comfort noise (noise played by a phone so you know it hasn't disconnected) never sounded so clear!  Naturally, it's all patented and proprietary.  Meanwhile there are open source systems capable of CD quality audio at speech latencies (<a href=""http://www.celt-codec.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.celt-codec.org/</a>), but why use that when you can pay for an AMR-WB license?<p>Actually, I set up an Asterisk PBX once for a demonstration of an HD voice system with a 48kHz/24-bit AEC system that was shown at Infocomm, and it does sound nice.",1256974748

To them, they have a strong bias between ""naturally-caused"" and ""human-caused"" effects; they would see 21,000 cases of polio as, ""Oh dear, well, that's nature (or God), and it's too bad we can't do anything about it.""<p>But, transform those 21,000 cases of polio into 2,000 cases of autism, and you get: ""<i>Someone did this!</i> Someone inflicted this, this is someone's fault, see, <i>we're not supposed to be messing with nature</i>.""<p>From the outside looking in, it's a strange bias, but it's the peculiar result of a sort of comfort in helplessness combined with poor education and a preference for emotional responses over logical thinking.",1256974346

913357,comment,912805,913191,0,0,gojomo,,,"Yes, the new vaccine is novel and it was rushed. That's not saying it was <i>imprudently</i> rushed, but producers have been racing to get these new-strain vaccines ready on a schedule <i>more compressed</i> and on a scale <i>much larger</i> than the usual seasonal process.<p>For example, reports indicate:<p>- Vaccine producers haven't been able to accurately predict the yields, as is typical of a new process.<p>- At first it was thought the new vaccine would require two shots, now it's thought one is enough.<p>- Different nations are preparing the vaccines differently -- for example in their varying use of adjuvants.<p>- Much of the initial supplies are a nasal vaccine which uses a weakened virus. Nasal vaccines are themselves a newer technology than traditional dead-virus shots. (Nasal vaccines have a good 6-year record; I prefer a safety record of decades.)<p>Advocates of universal vaccination can't have it both ways: that this virus is so new and unpredictable we should hurry to be vaccinated, but the vaccine based on that same virus is so old and reliable we can treat it, after just a few months' of trials, as having the exact same risk profile as decades of seasonal shots.<p>If the new vaccines were identical to seasonal vaccine plus the new strain, created completely via normal processes and schedules, then there would be just one seasonal shot, and 2009-H1N1 would be one of the added strains. (Last year's seasonal shot already included another H1N1 strain.) They chose not to follow that process, so they don't get the same decades-of-safety presumption.<p>No amount of short-term studies or expert assessment can replace years of aggregated experience. Medicine takes decades to converge on definitive answers, and has called many things wrong for years before correction.<p>So please, take my place at the front of the line. There's no right answer for everyone; searching the solution space requires a diversity of individual strategies. I'm not pregnant and I'm old enough that I've almost certainly had cases of, and vaccinations for, lots of cousins of the new virus. (I may have even already had one of the ""so mild treatment isn't even sought"" cases earlier this year, which is the best vaccination of all.)",1256973828

That might not be your cup of tea, but it's far from hard. And I think that the reason that most design discussions (other than one-off decisions) still happen in email is that you can't really 'write up' something in IRC the way that you can compose an email.<p>> <i>I thought we already established that project communication channels are primarily optimized for the project contributors who use them daily, not for once-off questions from end users.</i><p>Why not create a web forum/usenet/mailinglist gateway?

I'm pretty sure that's one of the reasons Euros use to feel above Americans. Education starts becoming important to how people perceive you when you're near upper middle class or above. And even then your success is more important.<p>When you say all these people have done all those successful things, are you talking about the entire history of your school?

And frankly, and again, the IE4 through IE6 era saw more innovation (and speed of innovation) than we have seen since.

However, I will say that your current approach is opposite of what the current popular mindset is in building web startups. (Whether that mindset is actually correct in any way or not could be a matter of some debate.)<p>You almost certainly are going to change your project's direction over time. Things that seem do-able now, or seem to be good ideas now, will be less feasible or less shrewd six months or a year now. So, if you lock yourself into this formal and structured plan, you might be foregoing the ability to maneuver quickly and change direction later on; and if you don't give those things up, then you're wasting some resources on something that you might be throwing away later.<p>In terms of marketing, your best bet is to advertise what you actually have, not what you intend to build, so again, the business plan doesn't help there.<p>That said, I can't disagree with having some direction, some goals, a roadmap, and a well-defined project to start with. But, those things don't need to be ""formal""; a whiteboard (if everyone is local), or good project management software would accomplish that just as well.<p>Now that I've done my utmost to avoid answering your question: one of the few business development books that I actually found helpful before launching my own business was ""The Six Week Startup"" [1]. It does a nice job of breaking down the entire business launching process into digestible, well-defined bits. If you really want to go with the traditional business development strategy, then I think this book might be what you're looking for.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Six-Week-Start-Up-Step-Step-Achieving/dp/0966963598"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Six-Week-Start-Up-Step-Step-Achieving/...</a>",1272957980

Again, it is only ""standards"" groups and the DOJ that forced Microsoft's hand out of innovating the browser space.

They have not. They were asked to stop for deliberations; they did; we are still waiting. It's hardly Microsoft's fault IE6 was so innovative that ""NOW"" browsers have yet to move against IE like IE moved against its competitors during the years of IE4 and IE6 (IE5 Mac).<p>The point being, waiting for ""standards"" to be signed, sealed, and delivered is all that has been holding back innovation.

That annoyed me, to say the least, and I'm of the opinion that the move has made their network less secure overall. On the other hand, I also realize that now they have a device with a simple, easy-to-understand interface, so when they choose to replace me with a full-time employee, they won't have to worry about whether the employee has any OpenBSD experience. It also guarantees that I'm not hiding any funky backdoors in their firewall, and hey, if there is a network incursion, then they can go after the SonicWall company ... versus not having anyone to catch the fault in the case that the OpenBSD box gets rooted.<p>I don't want to come across as mean here, but honestly, if someone can't understand why corporations aren't using more open source software, then they don't have much experience with corporations.",1272957180

Facebook has done things no Social Networking site before it has done, but that's how technology works.  MySpace was the king of it's day, doing things Friendster didn't do and Facebook is doing things MySpace didn't do.<p>You don't have to tell me that the engineers and designers are smart and talented, however I need to make a rebuttal here.<p>(a) I have no idea what the problems Facebook are [trying] to solve.  As far as I, as a user am concerned they haven't solved anything.  They <i>created</i> problems when the design committee decided they will ""test"" a new iteration of how Facebook looks and operates every winter solstice.  That is an issue for me because not only do I have to figure out where something I, and other users use on a daily basis, I now have to sit through another (n)weeks of users complaining about it because they don't have the technical fortitude to learn new technology.<p>That should be a wakeup call to Facebook.  Not all users are made equal, not everyone can look at a UI and make an educated guess what elements to click in order to upload a new image.  That is what prompted my comment that ""any UI engineer worth his paycheck"" should understand how vital it is not to assume users know everything.<p>Yet that is exactly what is crippling Facebook right now.  By not assuming your users can do the things your development staff does, you've taken it too far and assumed they need to be guided by the hand and told what they want and what's best for them.  The downvotes will come in two fold for me making this comment, but you're acting a lot like Apple is acting when it comes to the AppStore.  Apple constantly gets frustrated blog posts from well meaning developers who have their applications rejected because it's not best for the user.<p><i>Let the user decide that</i>.<p>Secondly.<p>(b) I dream for the day when technology plays as much a role role in developing social capital that money does, and I think it's great that Facebook came along and started doing things that really got people's heads to turn.  The opportunity to be in the arena to participate in the endeavor to bring a technological approach to the development and longevity of social capital is an opportunity I would rarely turn down.<p>But if it's all the same, and no offense to you sir, I would <i>never in my life</i> work a day for Facebook.",1272956712

Pardo actually commented on this at the Game Developer's Conference:<p><i>""If your matchmaking is really good, it means that for every single game, you're kind of the edge of your seat,"" Pardo said. ""After you play an hour or two of games like that, you're kind of exhausted. So we're actually talking about, 'Is that the right matchmaking approach?' You might want to add a little sloppiness to the matchmaking. Maybe that means sometimes you get stomped, but sometimes you have easier games. And sometimes you have the really competitive games. It's got better pacing.</i><p>(From <a href=""http://www.escapistmagazine.com/news/view/99211-Battle-net-StarCraft-II-Matchmaking-Too-Good"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.escapistmagazine.com/news/view/99211-Battle-net-S...</a>)<p>So there's that interesting human element there--how wide do your want your matchmaking algorithm to get?  Personally, I enjoy the nightmare intensity; it means I more easily get my fill for the night.  Is only being able to play a few games at a time actually a <i>bad</i> thing?  I guess it might be from Blizzard's perspective.<p>If you're in the beta, try playing 2v2 with a friend against the Internet.  If you're losing you can at least lose together.

So too integrating with internal systems and middleware.<p>Besides for an investment, I think the underlying philosophy of GV as being the notion of what can Google take from the portfolio company rather than the other way round could well apply (if Google's going to be a first customer, they may as well own a bit!). GV would be a good way to capture the ingenuity of Googlers who leave (or want to leave) to start up: Google is better positioned to access and capitalize on such companies without them having to be acquired first.<p>In any case, one area where GV could help is marketing of its portfolio companies on the main site, say alongside Google Labs.<p>One idea that'd be interesting is if VigLink, a GV portfolio company,  used Chrome so that users could claim affiliate revenue for any affiliate links coming through the browser. At the moment VigLink only works for webmasters, but why not users through a plugin? This has been an idea of mine called backscam. Good way for Chrome (or other browsers) to pickup more users by using VigLink's business model.",1272956469

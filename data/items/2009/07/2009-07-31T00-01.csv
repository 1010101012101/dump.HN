I.e. casual exercisers did much better than couch potatoes and heavy exercisers did much better than casual exercisers.<p>The groups were significantly different.  The ""obese"" people in the study had BMIs of over 30.  The ""very obese"" group had BMIs over 35.  The ""thin"" people had BMIs under 25.  Similarly, people with diagnosed hyper-tension were compared with those of low-risk blood pressures.  A variety of fitness levels were examined, ranging from couch potatoes to daily (but not competitive) runners.<p>The study found that fitness had a protective effect against each of the other risk factors.  In fact, the only other statistically independent predictor of mortality for men and women was smoking.<p>>Also, have the results of the study ever been replicated?<p>Yes.  There have been a number of very large studies that have produced similar results.<p>S.N.Blair et al. 1989 ""Physical fitness and all-cause mortality"" JAMA Nov;262: 2395-2401   (over 13,000 subjects)<p>I.M.Lee 2003 ""Physical activity in women: how much is good enough?""

733473,comment,732521,733410,0,0,splat,,,"Depends on what sort of knowledge you're trying to get.  If you just want to be able to point out constellations, I would recommend The Stars by H. A. Rey (yes, the same guy who wrote Curious George).  It's unique in that it displays the constellations in a manner that makes them actually look like what they're trying to represent (which ends up making them much easier to find).  There's also some good descriptions of the mythology behind many of the constellations and some other interesting features in the sky that can be picked out with the naked eye or binoculars.  There's also a section at the end that discusses the celestial sphere (how the sky changes during the seasons, the ecliptic, precession, etc.).<p>If you want something with more depth, I highly recommend Night Sky from St. Martin's Press.  It's a little 300 page field guide that will give you a comprehensive introduction to the heavens and basic astronomy and provides you with enough data to go out observing with.  The first quarter of the book is devoted to introducing the fundamentals of astronomy from the celestial sphere, to coordinate systems, to telescope designs, to the magnitude system, to variable stars, and stellar evolution.  The rest of the book contains star charts, detailed descriptions of each of the constellations and interesting objects therein, and information on the planets.  The only problem is that the book is a bit old, so the tables of data (sunset times, positions of the planets, etc.) are now out of date.  Nevertheless, it's well worth buying.<p>If you would like a more serious introduction to astronomy and know some basic physics and calculus, you can do no better than to read Introduction to Modern Astrophysics by Carroll & Ostlie (affectionately known as BOB -- the Big Orange Book).  It's about 1500 pages long and covers absolutely everything in astronomy.  It's clear, comprehensive, and will likely tell you everything you need to know.",1249001233

They need to compete on the overall experience.<p>Also, I'd avoid putting too much stock into: 2009=1991, iPhone=Mac and Android=Wintel.  Yeah, there are some similarities, but there are big differences.<p>For one thing, AppStore scandals aside, Apple's managment seems to be much better suited for competing with a strong rival than it was back then.<p>Second, the customers are different.  Part of the reason for Wintel's success is that they captured a growing # of departmental and institutional buyers.  The decision makers weren't, by and large, the end users.  They were more focused on up front costs.  If they were even thinking of ongoing costs, many probably saw it as a way to grow their empire further.  Phones are a consumer item. The buyers are almost always also the end-users, or at least in the same family. They have different priorities than corporate buyers in the early 90s.<p>Phones are also cheaper now than PCs were then, and people can buy an iPhone in the US for $99.<p>Fourth, the cost of the phone is just a small par of the total cost of ownership. The majority is the cost of cell service + a data plan. An android phone isn't going to be any cheaper, unless Google subsidizes the cost of the service plan with mobile advertising revenues (something that will likely bring antitrust scrutiny).<p>Fifth, the hardware ecosystems are different. Apple largely uses the same chips and ODMs for the iPhone as anyone else.  That means they get to take advantage of many of the same economies of scale as any other handset maker.",1248999731

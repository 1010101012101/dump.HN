   time-numoffset  = (""+"" / ""-"") time-hour "":"" time-minute
   time-offset     = ""Z"" / time-numoffset

   partial-time    = time-hour "":"" time-minute "":"" time-second
                     [time-secfrac]
   full-date       = date-fullyear ""-"" date-month ""-"" date-mday
   full-time       = partial-time time-offset

   date-time       = full-date ""T"" full-time
</code></pre>
If your data is going to stick around a while (and possibly loaded into some other system in the future) you should be sure to encode the timezone.",1201934828

Im pretty well on track. I initally cut some things that were in the original design, to make sure 3 months would do it. That was probably the hardest part of the whole thing - determining at the beginning what to leave out.",1201934222

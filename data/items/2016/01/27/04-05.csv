Have toyed with IntelliJ - but didn&#x27;t go deep with it.<p>For me IDEs are slow, complicated and the screens cluttered.  There are so many panels, options, buttons, etc.  All I want to see is the code.  With vi and multiple screens I can have more than enough windows open. I let the compiler generate warnings and errors. With a fast machine running make I hardly ever have to wait too long.<p>Besides, cutting code is only about 30% of the effort in a project.  Documentation, testing, support, meetings and more meetings take up the bulk of my time.  I actually enjoy the time I get to do real work!  Being more hands on feels good to me.",1453870762

Making games is all about drawing as little as possible and making as few draw calls as possible. Since CSS only supports planes (3d rectangles oriented in space) that means every cube is 6 draw calls and worse, if you want the browser to draw them correctly they have to be sorted. So let&#x27;s say you had a 16x16x16 voxel area, that&#x27;s potentially 24000 planes+ and 24000+ draw calls. That assumes worst case, all cubes with transparent bits like tree leaf blocks. For comparison many AAA games do little than 5000 draw calls per frame, possibly less.<p>Compare to a functional minecraft clone all of that would be condensed into a single mesh representing a 16x16x16 area. One draw call.<p>So yea, neat demo but you&#x27;re going to quickly hit the limits past a few boxy logos<p>If you&#x27;re looking for something that actually does do the optimizations necessary for a minecraft clone in the browser see <a href=""http://voxeljs.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://voxeljs.com</a>",1453870663

It was mainly a response to &quot;JSON and XML are only &#x27;wasteful&#x27; if you don&#x27;t count developer time. Once you do, it suddenly makes a lot of sense to &quot;waste&quot; hardware resources. After all, programmers are expensive. Hardware is cheap.&quot;<p>And pointing out that it really depends on what languages or type or programmers you use and what &quot;hardware&quot; is. In some languages binary parsing is really easy and just as cheap and elegant as using a json parser. And well, Joe is Erlang&#x27;s father, so point out Erlang was obvious choice.<p>As for hardware, bandwidth is not hardware. It really is &quot;something else&quot; -- a shared resource usually. And if there are enough devices using this even small changes start to make a difference.<p>Think a bit like a nested loop -- a small optimization in the inner loop might have large visible benefits. Or say, a huge database with 10B records, choosing an 32bit int vs an 16bit one for a column will make a for a good difference in size. That is basically where Joe was coming from. Really valuing bandiwidth as a shared resource. (He also likes to talk about protocols as well quite a bit).<p>> Again, the vast majority of mobile data isn&#x27;t JSON or XML<p>The important data is JSON though, the control message, the pages that load (and they are slow), stuff that stops, start, manages everything all that is JSON.<p>>  If mobile bandwidth was a Californian drought, video would be alfalfa farming<p>Hmm, video is  50% of all traffic on smart phones.

The green filter on Himawari&#x27;s camera doesn&#x27;t correctly capture the green color of vegetation, which is why OP&#x27;s video looks browner than you might expect. So this product attempts to correct for that by creating an artificial green channel made of a combination of other channels[2]. It also attempts to correct for Rayleigh scattering[3], so this is basically what the Earth would look like if the atmosphere suddenly disappeared (except for the clouds :P). The night portions of these images are a different kind of false color composite: the clouds come from two infrared channels, white are high ice clouds and red are low wet clouds; the city lights are (sadly) just a static overlay from existing data.<p>And (shameless plug) I&#x27;ve been playing with applying motion interpolation algorithms to these NOAA images to create smooth, high resolution video that can be played much slower. The Farneback optical flow algorithm[4][5] seems to work very well.

In fact, I&#x27;m getting fairly confident that CSS can potentially achieve <i>better</i> performance than UIKit and the Android stack (because it&#x27;s parallelizable and declarative as opposed to procedural, neither of which apply to mobile app frameworks), though of course browsers of today don&#x27;t take advantage of this well.<p>Another large issue is that browser implementations of CSS are a black box: very few Web developers understand how it works and browsers present a hidden maze of slow paths. (Which CSS animations will run in the compositor? Which run a separate thread? What events cause off main thread scrolling to be disabled? What order will the browser fire events in?)

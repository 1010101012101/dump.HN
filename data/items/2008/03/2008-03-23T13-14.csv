They might need the health insurance, or to pay off their student loans. They might want to focus on other things besides work.""<p>But what if it is just cowardice?<p>Just because it's ok to make fun of people for their religion and not their race doesn't mean that people will be less upset if you make fun of their religion. If anything, they will be more upset since the fact that they chose it freely makes it more personal. Sure, in some cases it wasn't their choice, but in most cases it was. And surely if you have freedom of choice, and make the wrong decision, then that must reflect poorly on you. I mean I almost can't think of a better working-definition of intelligence, or lack thereof.<p>Anyway I enjoyed the essay, but just sayin'",1206279218

You have to see it"" She pulled out the unassuming little brick videocorder and with enthusiasm demonstrated it. It makes cute Tivo'esque sounds when you press a button. She is not very technically savvy yet she has used it to shoot video and share video (via USB copying, not YouTube) with friends and family (baby videos mostly). The video quality is decent and it fits in her purse (important). She has shipped at least one FlipVideo overseas.",1206279147

History is too often rewritten later by writers who didn't understand why something was popular at the time that it was actually taking off. So they just pick whatever glamorous reason sounds the most revolutionary.<p>He may be right though.",1206278846

Forget lions and zoos; that's the real difference between people who make good employees and those who don't. I know people I was at school with who wanted to work (for example) for IBM (because their dad did), achieved their ambition and are still there over 20 years later. I've had literally a dozen jobs in the same time. Whenever I've worked for companies like IBM or KPMG, etc, I got bored pretty damned fast, and soon left for more interesting work. But if you feel validated by your employer's credentials, you're probably never going to move on, and you'll put up with masses of crap in the meantime. We're all wired up different.",1206278251

Whereever did these guys get the idea that the principal task of the human brain consists of compressing information about our environment? Even if this succeeds, all they will end up with is a very good compression algorithm for text. This is typical of research on AGI, just grabbing at straws with no idea of what's going to work. The field is not scientific.<p>If history is any guide, though, a lot of trying and failing like this is necessary before we figure out what's important to work on. I still think they should instad use their 50000â‚¬ on paying food and rent for a young, inspired researcher in the field to try out as many crazy ideas as possible.",1206277381

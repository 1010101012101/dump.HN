Using prepackaged software is a dead end. You can't do anything further with it. You usually don't learn anything that will give you an idea for doing something else. It may be just a time vs money trade-off for non-developers but the equation is different for developers. Fun and learning opportunities come into play.",1250002756

755333,comment,752468,752468,0,0,arthurk,,,"This reminds me of a chapter from Michael Lopp's book ""Managing Humans"":<p>""Each weekend morning, my process is this: I wake up, walk upstairs, sit down at the computer, and figure out what is happening on the planet. Once I'm comfortable that the sky is not falling, I walk to the kitchen, grind my coffee beans, and begin to boil water. While the water is heating up, I return to my computer and follow up on whatever tidbits tickled my fancy from my first pass. This morning, it was some font research, followed by looking into options for wireless headphones. Turns out, Sony sucks. Go figure. Water's boiling! Back to the kitchen, where I pour hot water into my French press and dig up my favorite ceramic cup. The coffee needs to sit for three minutes, which means back to the computer! OK, so why do Sony headphones suck? Poor sound quality? Bad design? Bit of both, really. Coffee's ready, so one more trip to the kitchen, where I pour the steaming brew into my favorite cup and travel, once more, back to my cave.<p>It looks like a lot of work, but I do it instinctively. It's a routine designed to do one thing â€” get me into the zone.""<p>Quote taken from <a href=""http://my.safaribooksonline.com/9781590598443/the_zone"" rel=""nofollow"">http://my.safaribooksonline.com/9781590598443/the_zone</a>",1250002670

Very tough in that circumstance for me, completely blew it. Interestingly that was 11 years ago, I am now the chief architect and the other fellow has been gone for years. I doubt I could today just stand up and write a binary search from scratch that was worth darn. Even though it is not that tough of a problem.<p>Programming in my opinion is a reading comprehension skill, solving cute little technical problems won't build large scale maintainable solutions. Even though they are fun to throw around at interviews they don't prove much. :)",1250002626

755327,comment,754725,754795,0,0,ZachPruckowski,,,"It's possible, but I find it a bit unlikely.  Porn differs from other media in that it's easily replaceable by inferior goods.  If someone can get off on watching a 7.0 on PornTube or whatever, you can't get them to pay for an 8.0, you have to have a 10.0 before they'll pay money for it.<p>By contrast, there's a large difference between even a decent amateur movie and The Dark Knight.  Part of this is production costs, but a lot of it is that there's not a diminishing return on ""epic"" or ""action-packed"", or at least there's less diminishing return relative to porn.<p>So while the cost of making a quality production in both fields is falling, it impacts porn much more than it ever will film because there's a differing sensitivity to quality.",1250002539

Her conclusion was not that you should strive to do better than that--it was that society and the government should make it easier to scrape along with minimal effort.

For Â£100k+ projects it typically goes like this:<p>Companies get a invitation to tender, usually europe wide. Companies submit an overview of what they want to do to solve the problem. Companies that have been in business less than 3 years or don't have a sound financial background are weeded out.<p>Then it's typically it's narrowed down to 3-6 companies early on. Each submits a 100-150 page tender (on paper or MS word - often with heavy copy+paste from previous bids) with prices (blind - you don't know the competitor's prices), different options etc. Each company gives a talk with a sales person and a technical person at least - are grilled by half a dozen people who all know their stuff from the customer and have different technical requirements and beliefs + management people with their own ideas. This goes on for about 6-12 months where no money changes hands and seller incurs travel/staff etc. costs.<p>Then it's narrowed down to 2-3 for extra implementation details and more meetings with other key stake holders - many of which have just heard of the project and often don't approve of the direction.<p>If you win the tender, you start getting paid in a schedule (4 or 5 big payments) depending on implementation of the project, with the final payment often 3-6 months after it's all working and live.<p>I would suggest if it is your business model to sell expensive products to large companies, that you have someone in sales who has done this all before.",1250002065

Linux supports more drivers in terms of legacy and current hardware out of the box, unlike Vista and XP which culled legacy hardware support, and don't have as many drivers as linux in terms of out of the box support.<p>So I must agree it's a horrible argument.<p>>""Open source software is free if your time is worth nothing.""<p>While I agree with your original point, that it's the freedom in terms of control. This argument is completely invalid because it's like saying ""Windows sucks because 4 year olds can't administer it effectively thus it takes longer"". If you're going into OSS you need OSS specialized and trained staff, someone who has only worked with Windows Server isn't going to be able to effectively manage OSS, OSes because it's obviously logically different. (Difference is if they've used a commercial UNIX which is quite close to Linux you just have to modify some habits and learn package management for your distro).<p>In short the problem is the lack of preparation that goes into going Open Source in a company, such as getting the IT staff familiar enough with the tech.<p>Example of Windows vs. Linux -- <i>Setting up FTP, allowing user logins disabling anon. (Using CentOS as distro)</i><p>CentOS:<p><pre><code>  yum groupinstall ""FTP Server""\n  vi /etc/vsftp/vsftpd.conf\n  \n  anonymous_enable = no\n  local_enable = yes\n\n  chkconfig vsftpd 345\n  service vsftpd on\n</code></pre>\nWindows:<p><pre><code>  Open Server Role Manager\n  Go Through Server Role Wizard to Select FTP server role\n  Go into IIS options.\n  Go through multiple prompts, properties screens and wizards to finally enable local login and disable anonymous.\n</code></pre>\nIn short:<p>I can remember every step of the install on Linux, on Windows I have to be looking at the damn screen. Yet I've spent as many years on Windows Server as on Linux. However because I know exactly what commands on the commandline do and it's an easier interface to remember off the top of my head than a GUI, I can do it faster IF (very big if) I have all the knowledge I need.<p>Not only that but the ""vendor lock in"" is so inherent to Windows, people don't realize their core data (how their server is set up) is almost impossible to get at and export without the use of <i>third-party</i> full backup tools. Unlike Linux in Windows I can't clone /etc/ or some parts of /etc and stick it on a different server running the same version of the OS and expect it to be a drop in replacement.",1250000955

2610453,comment,2610274,2610431,3,0,nirvdrum,,,"It's important as a communication tool.  But you'd still be in a world of hurt because that logical distinction doesn't affect execution semantics.  The problem is exacerbated once transitive dependencies enter the picture.<p>As a concrete example, the redis-rb gem went to 2.0 and completely broke API compatibility.  They did everything right by the semantic versioning book.  I used about 10 libraries built atop redis-rb, but never used redis-rb directly.  About half the libs updated and required the use of redis-rb 2.0, the other half did not.  Moreover, the gem dropped protocol support for the old redis-server, too, so it forced a redis-server upgrade.<p>This was an absolute mess to work out because updating 10 libs at once is basically insane.  And the whole thing could have been avoided if modules were used to namespace, allowing activation of both sets of classes.<p>But, anyway, this isn't to say semantic versioning has no value.  It's just not a solution to a library that keeps changing its public API either.",1306983521

2610444,comment,2610078,2610078,4,0,btilly,,,"What bitcoin needs is a killer app.<p>For instance on April 15 the US government shut down all of the online poker sites that were letting people play poker for money in the USA.  If you look at the charges, they pretty much all have to do with wire fraud.  (The operator of the site can also be charged, but analyses that I have seen suggest that that charge may be harder to make stick in the case of poker.)  If someone is willing to not travel to the USA, and is willing to set up a poker site that does transactions in bitcoin, then all of those financial issues go away.  (Or are subsumed in the inevitable ones that bitcoin will face, depending on your point of view.)<p>There are a lot of issues to getting a poker site to work well.  (People will let you charge surprisingly high fees if in return you do a lot of policing to eliminate people running bots and who are engaged in various kinds of cheating.)  However there are a lot of online poker players suffering serious withdrawal in the USA.  The market is there.  And the online poker market in the USA until a month and a half ago was well over an order of magnitude larger than the current bitcoin economy.<p>So there you have a realistic company which could be built, now, using bitcoin.  You can generally count me as a bitcoin skeptic, but if someone can get traction with something like this, bitcoin may indeed have a nice future.",1306983404

Using a cross-platform API disincentives one to only develop for Windows as now the benefits to using platform specific technologies available only to Windows has been marginalized.<p>If they're going for lowest common denominator apis like HTML/JS, then you get subpar LCD applications that Apple can blow away via better support in native apps and Apple OS specific APIs for Objective-C/XCode.

But then it would be trivial to say ""Hey! AirBNB isn't an asset play. It's valued based on growth. The asset value is a worst-case scenario, but most of the other scenarios involve a lot of revenue growth and free cash flow.""<p>Basically, is there any valuation method you have that would make you indifferent to a bet on the portfolio's valuation going up or down?

That's fine if your environment allows you to activate two different versions of a library, but most don't.

I apologize in advance for the big block of text.<p>""(Original post) Me - In agreement with Fred Wilson, it's one thing to patent a pharmaceutical, but patenting software ideas is inane: http://www.avc.com/a_vc/2011/06/enough-is-enough.html<p>Him - This may be irrelevant, but the guy begins by pointing out that a software patent is like a patent on music, and then says both would be absurd. But isn't a copyright, which covers music, rather similar to a patent in many respects?<p>Me - I believe he was pointing out the bigger picture--that the system has been perverted. The precedent has been set in this field, and I don't think he was challenging it on legal grounds.<p>It has come to the point where one can visualize in simple terms what is very hard to actually produce and then patent it. (Legal context aside) Music represents an end product ready for consumption. While copyrights may be similar from a legal point of view, the process from the creator or inventor's perspective is radically different. There is a potential for abuse that Fred argues has been realized.<p>Him - Yeah, I wasn't trying to say that he's making a legal error, but rather that his facts may be sufficiently off to derail his reasoning. Of course, software patents might be seen as a tax on later innovators. But then again, patents also reward innovation, specifically the first movers. More than anything, it seems to me that his beef is with how software patents are administered, rather than their existence altogether. Neither the fact that patents can be bought/sold, nor the fact that people are enforcing their property rights undermine the patent system itself. Instead, these events simply show that someone is enforcing the rights they've been granted. If he wants to take on software patents altogether, he ought to spend more time on showing how granting those rights here inhibits more innovation than it encourages: if that's true, then he might have a good point. Ample instance, however, exist for both sides. For instance, I'd say giving Microsoft some patent rights expedited the proliferation of computer technology. That said, the author and I would probably agree that more innovation-details might be needed before granting patents, although I don't know the particular facts of the case he's describing.<p>Good points. Surely innovation comes with a cost that patents offset. It's just his suspicion that too much value can be obtained by so little work and ingenuity. No in-depth analysis on Fred's part, but I do share his suspicion.<p>As for this particular case:\nhttp://thisismynext.com/2011/05/17/lodsys-sends-ios-developers-cease-and-desist-letters-in-app-purchases-on/\nand then:\nhttp://thisismynext.com/2011/05/23/apple-steps-handle-ios-patent-troll-lodsys-small-developers/<p>I do think it comes down to the process of patent administration. I would like to highlight one example: the infamous Amazon One Click to Purchase patent. Securing this patent was not a matter of Amazon being the ""first mover"" on a novel/non-obvious idea as much as it was conducting business in a manner which was both obvious and organically derived... then patenting it... then using its rights in an anti-competitive manner against Barnes and Noble.<p>Is there not a fundamental difference in cost vs reward between Microsoft R&D and Amazon's One Click Purchase? I think so. There may be a problem. Identifying and addressing that problem (if it exists) will take a while.<p>Sorry I'm speaking to the bigger issues, not exactly what this guy wrote. I won't attempt to defend his precise reasoning.<p>Him - Cool, I think we agree on most points then. I wish I knew more about patent law though -- it's important stuff.""",1306981499

I bought a big monitor because I want several apps and all of their content to be simultaneously visible at all times. I shudder whenever a member of my family ""borrows"" my PC for a few minutes and goes on to maximize all the windows without even thinking twice. And I certainly don't want to wave my arms all across the big screen like an idiot. There's a very good reason why we have a small device (mouse) that can be manipulated with the flick of a finger to control an arbitrarily larger interface. I don't know how a small touchscreen might be used in a similar role while retaining the intuitiveness of a touch interface, but we're definitely going to need something like that or our arms will begin to hurt very badly after 10 minutes.",1306980933

Why? Because, the small biz owner has complete reign over the area their ads get displayed thanks to the ability to target Facebook users not only by state, but by city, as well; along with complete reign over who sees their ads within those regions thanks to the handful of targeting options Facebook's ad platform offers, like age, gender, marital status, and the like.<p>The only drawback to their platform is that is it display-centric, rather than search-centric like that of Adwords. While you can target keywords, or ""Likes,"" on Facebook, they really don't hold a flame to the ability to target keywords on Adwords, specifically keywords like, ""buy [item],"" ""chinese restaurant in [city].""<p>Undoubtedly, a lot more can be said about the merits and shortcomings of both.

Don't depend on any general principles to apply to both.<p>Second, it's probably better if you don't think in terms of ""ownership"". In Berne-convention signatory nations (i.e., just about all nations, including the U.S.), copyright exists in most works on their completion, with the legal author(s) holding the copyright until it expires. That would usually be the actual authors, unless it is a work for hire, in which case it is usually the employer.<p>So if the work is created by employees of a corporation as part of their work, and there is no contract stating to the contrary, then the issues you bring up do not arise; the corporation is the sole legal author.<p>In a work with multiple legal authors, all authors would have to agree to any licensing. One way to do this is for all authors to agree formally that some particular party may act as their agent in such matters. If this is not done, then, whenever any licensing or publishing issues come up, they need to be run by all authors for their approval.<p>As for trademarks: couldn't say.",1306980347

A library that parses a DSL, such that you can then code in that DSL, is still a lame duck if that library, <i>plus</i> the encodings of all the useful solutions in the domain, add up to more code than just the solutions would be when expressed in a general language. The ROI of (learning the DSL + maintaining the library) would be negative.<p>On the other hand, there are things like Prolog. You <i>can</i> think of Prolog as a backtracking constraint-solving library, and then another library that parses a DSL for expressing facts and procedural constraints and feeds it to the first library. But Prolog&#x27;s language isn&#x27;t really a DSL, because it isn&#x27;t particular to any domain: there&#x27;s no closed solution-space where Prolog applies. The efficiency gains you get from Prolog&#x27;s elision of proceduralized contraint-solution code <i>can</i> apply to any program you write. And so its value is unbounded; its ROI is certainly positive, whatever the cost was to implement it.<p>That&#x27;s the comparison that&#x27;s useful here, I think.

Personally I&#x27;d rather watch the whole GoT season now to avoid seeing spoilers.<p>I think because of binging, better quality content is being created that is more complete and movie like. This content is meant to be consumed as a whole complete series and written as such, rather than hacked together a few weeks out and more plot holes or unnecessary episodes. Shows are so much better consumed in whole rather than across many many weeks, it leads to a stronger buy into the characters and the writing.<p>With binging, full availability, people can also easily catch up this way and watch older series more readily together. What we are moving to is a much better system than linear broadcast television which was only that way because there was limited network and resource availability, also it was all about the ads.

They came in two flavors: geostationary and low-earth orbit.<p>The geostationary satellites are perched very high above the earth, and take frequent pictures of the &#x27;full disk&#x27; of earth.  This is invaluable for weather forecasting, as we can see what clouds are doing in real time.  However, they are so far away that you need big, expensive satellites and big, expensive launches, and the resulting resolution is quite poor (like one pixel per 5km depending on latitude, and worse at high latitudes).<p>On the other hand, the low-earth orbit satellites fly just above the atmosphere, and can take pictures at much higher (spatial) resolution, but may only fly over a particular spot of land once per day.  So you trade temporal resolution for spatial resolution.<p>With miniaturization, advances in imaging and related technology, and decreasing launch costs, it should be possible to deploy a constellation of small low-earth-orbit satellites, to provide good temporal AND spatial resolution.  That enables a whole bunch of new applications.<p>However, I&#x27;d be a bit concerned that long-lived airborne drones flying at high altitudes might do the same thing (good spatial AND temporal resolution), but at a lower price point and in a more efficient way (since you only fly where you want to look, instead of covering the entire globe).<p>Perhaps I&#x27;m missing something?",1428968321

You&#x27;re in the planet&#x27;s reference frame so you inherit its orbital velocity. Exiting a slingshot in the direction of planet&#x27;s retrograde (<i>not</i> in the direction to the Sun) you can kill off <i>some</i> velocity, but nowhere near enough to just drop yourself into the sun. You do need to bleed out that 30km/s to actually hit the sun.",1428966335

It turns out that in my very first professional job, as an intern thirty years ago, I had a colleague, a chemist, who had worked in beverage technology. The summer before he had been an intern and was given the task of figuring out if there was a particular chemical that gave whisky the distinctive taste of being aged in an oak cask. The company figured if they could isolate the chemical maybe they could just mix it in, and skip five or ten years of aging. So my friend went into the lab and isolated what he thought might be the right compound. He ordered a small vial from a chemical supply company (remember, this was before online shopping and email, so they had to actually write words on paper) and mixed up a batch. It tasted pretty good. (Why can&#x27;t we computer scientists get research projects that involve consuming alcohol?) My friend was duly congratulated, and he wrote to the chemical supply company and asked for a 55 gallon drum of the stuff. They wrote back, saying &quot;we regret that we can not fill your order because we are currently low on stock and, as I&#x27;m sure you know, to produce this chemical we need to age it in oak casks for five years.&quot;",1428966161

The initial enthusiasm, the progressive difficulties in keeping the students engaged that could never be addressed(new media-> unexpected problems) and lastly what i think could be considered a failure, students with definitely worst degree and that started dropping out.\nQuality free material will be increasingly available for sure, but for a typical student is not easy to maintain the consistency needed to study this way. Similarly, universities will have a hard time refactoring their curses to provide something usable/meaningful/useful.<p>What instead is already evident is the success of web-based courses not related to degrees, small packeted courses on a single subject that target young or not so young adults that want to learn a new language or other stuff.\nAs you know there are a lot of interesting start-ups in this area.",1281344206

1587396,comment,1587236,1587355,0,0,btilly,,,"It may be ""pretty well established"" but I don't believe it.<p>I read your link, and you are basing memory based on an experiment that is unlikely to have strong emotional impact for the kid.  Without strong emotional impact, I wouldn't expect memory to last.  That says nothing about what can happen with memories of more impactful events.<p>Here is an anecdote that happened with my son.  Before he was 7 months he spent several hours a week in a mommy and me run by one Tandy Parks.  Then we moved and he never saw her again.  When he was 1 1/2 we had the opportunity to drop in on that mommy and me class.  Despite normally being shy, he quickly found his way to her lap, which is most emphatically <i>not</i> a behavior he shows with strangers.<p>Going back to your link, the researcher says, <i>""Most single experiences before age 8 months, unless they are very emotional or painful, are probably lost.""</i>  That qualification makes perfect sense to me, and is very relevant to the example at hand.  My son had very emotional interactions with Tandy, and so he still had associations with her.  I'm sure he wouldn't have remembered a toy from the same period.  And particularly not a toy he had limited interactions with.<p>Furthermore the researcher has another good reason to put that qualification in there.  A number of research studies that demonstrated that strong pain can alter responses to pain months to years later, even in very small infants.  This is clear evidence of memory.  In particular these studies have focused on comparing the responses of circumcised and uncircumcised males to shots.  Many groups of researchers have demonstrated that circumcised males have more trouble with pain at 6 months.  Some research suggests it may still apparent as late as 2.5 years.<p>If you're talking about conscious and structured memories, they appear to start much later than 1.  See <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Childhood_amnesia"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Childhood_amnesia</a> for more on that topic.  Bringing it back to my son, at 5 he shows no conscious memories of things that happened when he was 2 (though he still has positive associations with things we did together), but he has some memories from when he was 3, and a lot of very specific memories from age 4.",1281343918

For example, there are people who like to write a few lines, then test, write a few more lines, test again, and so on. For them dynamic languages are prefect.<p>On the other hand, I am the complete opposite. I often work for hours or days, sometimes even weeks, on a program without ever running it. This is only possible when 99.9% of all errors immediately caught by the compiler (or IDE). Also, I document everything that I do extensively with Javadocs or similar mechanisms. When I write in dynamic languages, I usually start writing the static type annotations (""//array of string"") as comments, without having the benefit of using code completion and refactoring.

Compared to either of those a toy seems to be pretty insignificant and if there is one thing the brain is really good at it is discarding stuff that isn't relevant. Older children that would remember the toy might have been more captivated by it. Babies that I know can be utterly fascinated by some things and completely oblivious to other things, then reverse their interest a while later for no reason that I as an adult can fathom.<p>Of course the memories of any early experience will fade over time but I wouldn't rule them out so quickly based on this specific experiment, which seems to assume rather a lot about the subjects desire to remember that particular toy and about vision, not memory per se. It's a pretty indirect test.<p>If something doesn't interest me I won't remember it even today, and I take it as read that my 'long term memory' has been formed by now.<p>Interesting reading:<p><a href=""http://www.google.com/search?q=do+babies+remember+the+womb"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.google.com/search?q=do+babies+remember+the+womb</a><p>If there is a definitive study that babies can not form memories that could make it through to the age of the OPs child then you'd have to wonder how come babies age 1 can use words and seem to be able to understand some pretty complicated concepts as well as having learned how to use a good part of their bodies musculature, it's not at all rare to have 1 year olds that can walk or even run. If they can do all that without long term memory you'd have to posit some mechanism that allows them to do all this with a memory that spans at most a day. After all, if every day is a new day then you would have to explain the kind of character development you seen in babies during their first year and all this other stuff that I think is definitely memory based <i>without</i> the ability to form long term memories.<p>Also, vision is a relatively new thing for a newborn, they've seen colours but not actual objects and it takes them a fair amount of time to start to make sense of our 3D world. Sound is different, babies can hear pretty good at a relatively early time during the gestation period (about 5 months in), which means that they then have 4 months to be exposed to their moms heartbeat in a way that they could be aware of it.<p>Also, you can refresh memories by re-thinking of something that you still remember and you can remember that experience as something by itself, so even with only a shorter term memory you could theoretically carry things over a longer period.

They simply aren't smart enough.  A fifth of people are ""functionally"" illiterate.  It's a real stretch to blame that on training/schooling rather than dim wits.<p>Fifty years ago these people could earn a decent living tightening nuts on an assembly line or picking fruit.  Now they're just borderline useless as we have machines to do most of that sort of work.  It takes 100 people to build a sky scraper, whereas there used to be an army of men running around with wheel barrows.<p>The whole point of the article and the referenced book, ""A Farewell to Alms"", is that people have different genetic and cultural potentials in a modern industrialized society.  The book documents how the English gene pool changed (eugenic forces) leading up to the industrial revolution.  It argues that the industrial revolution happened in England because the English people had become smart and disciplined enough to work in factories.  English industrialists in the 1800s kept on trying to take factories to cheap third world labor, and over and over it failed because the local population couldn't hack it.  Productivity was too low.  It was not a matter of training.<p>The point here is that we are dealing with uncomfortable issues that transcend something like a ""no child left behind"" act.

Despite the moaning you hear about processed food, a major problem is that our modern diet is under-processed.<p>There are many foods that used to universally be soaked & aged, sprouted, fermented, or treated with lye, or a combination of these steps, in order to eliminate anti-nutrients and allergens.  This is rarely done on the modern industrial scale for reasons of cost.  Modern flour is not the same thing as people were eating 150 years ago.  The native americans always treated corn with lye.  The settlers didn't and consequently got pellagra, and we continue to eat untreated corn.<p>Read Stephan Guyenet and the Weston Price Foundation have literature on various traditional processing steps and chemically what they were achieving.",1281341584

Such as ""Do I want to own a house?""<p>For me, the answer to that question is quickly arrived at by asking a few of your homeowner friends what they did last weekend, and what they plan to do next weekend.  The answer will invariably revolve around some form of maintenance on the house.<p>Like it or not, buying a house gives you a new full-time hobby.

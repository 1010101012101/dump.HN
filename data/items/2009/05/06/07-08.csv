Now, a few months later, he got out of the shower and just died. The doctor said that he seemed to have died before he even hit the ground..<p>In the same room as the doctor explaining that ""We dont know what killed your son"" were the body harvesters. All they could do was to pressure the parents, my uncle and aunt, to donate every part of his body, even though they had no idea WHAT killed him.<p>I do find these body parts people just plain disgusting. To these people, ""No"" means keep pestering more.<p>And yes, I also do worry that if a RN or doctor sees that donor card, they might not do as good of a job to save me. Not that they would do _bad_, but they would quit sooner than a non-donor.",1241596501

595401,comment,595251,595372,0,0,gustavo_duarte,,,"Other interesting books, in addition to the excellent ""Soul"", are ""Show Stopper!"", which covers the development of Windows NT, ""Microserfs"" (fiction) by Douglas Coupland, and ""Proudly Serving My Corporate Masters"". These are centered on MS culture, but I think they are representative of the industry at large. NT in particular took a heavy toll, with apparently many divorces and strong burn out in the team.<p>I think it has to do with the culture in many of the firms doing this type of development. Take bright motivated kids out of school, move them close to a corporate campus where they don't know anyone outside of work, work them 70 hours a week, burn out, discard.<p>I'm not saying this is all by an evil design, it might just be the way things work out, but I have seen the bitter results as well.<p>As to the nature of the work itself, I think close-to-the-metal work is a lot of fun. Too bad the work conditions are often rocky. I doubt you'd see the same burn out effect on those in sane work conditions.",1241596353

And when you oversubscribe to RSS feeds, which many of us do, you start drowning in a flood of posts you don't feel like reading.<p>Links you get on Twitter, on the other hand, are already pre-filtered. Somebody must have already read the article and decided it's worth sharing. You also know from previous experience who is sharing good links and who is sharing crap, so you know whose links are worth clicking.<p>But this can only work as long as some people keep on reading lots of articles and only share the good ones. You're not gonna get any new links once everyone decides to abandon RSS and only read articles shared by people they follow on Twitter.",1241595982

When I'm searching for technical things (like, all day while programming) the stemming and word substitution can be irritating.

In case you didn&#x27;t hear, she Kickstarted a Tropes vs. Women in Video Games series of videos about gender representation in video games. Got a lot of harassment in return for those videos and when GamerGate came about that intensified enough to make her leave her home and cancel a speaking arrangement. In turn, she was interviewed on The Colbert Report.<p>Now a 12 year old have reached the same conclusion and if that&#x27;s her real name on the article... alas I must say that was a dangerous thing to do.",1425866397
9168513,comment,9168064,9168064,0,0,bramgg,,,"> In one game, “Survival Run with Bear Grylls,” you can put the character in a Santa Claus suit for $1.98, but there is no girl to be had at any price. Does this mean that girls aren’t capable of escaping a bear, but Santa is?<p>Another classic example of girls that are capable of escaping bears being unrepresented in tech. I kid, by seriously the cause of this isn&#x27;t game devs being sexest against girls, it&#x27;s (IMO) society being sexist in general. Boys (not men) will not play games that look like they may be made for girls because of what society might think of them. The fear of being bullied for enjoying anything pink or featuring women is very real for most boys growing up, especially (but not only) if the boy is already feeling confused and ashamed of what his sexuality might be. Since the mobile game market is dominated by children, having the main character be female can potentially scare away a large percentage of the market. Unless the game is already clearly &quot;girly&quot;, then the risk just isn&#x27;t worth it.<p>TL;DR: Boys playing girls = gay, girls playing boys = normal.",1425866384

9168499,comment,9167781,9168117,0,0,darkmighty,,,"In Dota for example the false complexity is what allows someone with not so great analytical thinking but great knowledge of the complexity (items and hero combinations) to fare pretty well. It helps level the field. Although comparing go to RTS is extremely misleading. RTS&#x27;s have pretty deep of what I call &#x27;continuous tactics&#x27; where you need to plan an optimal control of your character with a continuum rather than discrete set of plays. It presents incredibly rich situations which you cannot explain with the kind of strategy you see in go or chess, for instance. The same goes for games like counter-strike, once you take into account limited aiming capability. I think it&#x27;s beautiful how those games can hide this richness into a very fun game at low levels, and how they don&#x27;t seem so hard just because we&#x27;re so good at spatial reasoning and planning.<p>Here&#x27;s an illustration:<p><a href=""http://youtu.be/5e8HZqF3cyk?t=2m1s"" rel=""nofollow"">http://youtu.be/5e8HZqF3cyk?t=2m1s</a><p>I also like this quote by von Neumann:<p>&quot;If people do not believe that mathematics is simple, it is only because they do not realize how complicated life is.&quot;<p>I confess I do wonder what would be the equivalent &#x27;go of RTS games&#x27;, where the minimal, essential dynamics are captured without all the bling.",1425866201

There is simply no such thing as meaningful consent when someone is intoxicated.<p>Someone else brought up the idea of &quot;grey area sex&quot;, with the example of two intoxicated parties. This happens enough between willing participants that we can&#x27;t simply wave it away as &quot;never OK, always rape&quot;, but we also can&#x27;t say that just because a person was too drunk to say no that they can&#x27;t have been raped (as more than a few people in positions of power have said or implied, even in this decade).<p>Anyway, my concern with waving away this situation (&quot;they were both drunk&quot;) as being not rape (or both parties being in the wrong), is that it can and is used by people who want to victimize others without consequence. I&#x27;ve known a man who used this approach; it eventually came out that he&#x27;d used the tactic on a number of occasions to rape several of our mutual friends. His modus operandi was to encourage heavy drinking or drug use, isolate the woman (to &quot;take care of her&quot; or &quot;make sure she gets home OK&quot;), and then have sex with her, whether she was willing or not. When questions were raised by his male friends about stuff like this, he would wave it off with a &quot;I don&#x27;t really remember, we were both so wasted&quot;, and his male friends would shrug and say, &quot;Oh, OK, I guess shit happens.&quot; It took an organized effort by women in our social circle to put a stop to it.<p>I think what makes this hard to grasp for most men is that most men don&#x27;t <i>want</i> to do this. Most men want to have sex with people who reciprocate the feeling. So, when a woman comes forward and says, &quot;This happened to me. A man did this to me.&quot; A lot of men process that first through their lens of, &quot;I would never do that. I can&#x27;t believe she says men do stuff like that.

In either case, you needed to (rote) learn some technical skills to have a bit of fun.<p>In retrospect, I see I was lucky enough to come into computing at exactly the right time. When I was young I was capable of understanding (practically) my entire computer system, because those systems were so simple. As the complexity increased, so did the depth of my understanding.

It would be better to involve the authorities if you feel you are being rapped or harassed. From my personal point of view I have seen SO many women complain about being harassed or put down, and the fact is they may have, but I have never seen it. I work regularly with women in my jobs and I&#x27;ve never seen or had a problem. Some are bad team members and some are good.

I&#x27;m calling bullshit on not just this article, but half these articles. There is definitely less women in tech, and nothing is inherently wrong with that. If there&#x27;s something I can do to make it more inclusive, I will. However, please OP and anyone reading this, come at it with an open mind. Just because women aren&#x27;t in tech does not imply something is wrong. Women and men are different, it&#x27;s okay as long as it is not a sexist barrier. Just not having a lot of women does not mean there is that barrier.<p>Every situation is different, and you may have indeed been wronged (and I can sympathize), but stop generalizing. It&#x27;s borderline sexism to claim &quot;everyone in tech is sexist against women,&quot; we all know males have to watch themselves and be careful. That&#x27;s probably why the OP was offered money, people are so scared of being called sexist, because it&#x27;s so blown out of proportion. Handle it like everything else, with a clear mind.<p>If we are going to talk about sexism, give me the facts, give me the barrier, and give me a way I can fix it besides just being &quot;subconsciously and uncontrollably bias.&quot; If that can&#x27;t be done, then there probably isn&#x27;t justification to discuss the concerns (yet).",1425864123

Mozilla sometimes gets confused and makes bad choices, like manually reviewing all code that gets published in its addon store and refusing to ship patent-encumbered H.264 codecs, that further hurt adoption and reinforce the reputation that Firefox makes it &quot;harder&quot; than necessary to use the web.<p>Google made a deal with Adobe to fix up some of the stability and performance issues in Flash and they ship the improved plugin as &quot;Pepper&quot;, part of Chrome; Mozilla still doesn&#x27;t have a good solution for this, though it has a small start in Shumway.<p>Google built an internal PDF reader so that people didn&#x27;t have to worry about Adobe Reader popping up as they clicked around.

Or those who have a lot of free time and can study for these interviews (for example look at this Quora link <a href=""http://www.quora.com/How-much-time-did-you-spend-preparing-for-Googles-interviews"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.quora.com/How-much-time-did-you-spend-preparing-f...</a> the first reply mentions spending 28.5 hours per week for 5 weeks, which is 142.5 hours total)  From a senior software engineers perspective that&#x27;s a ridiculous commitment for something where an arrogant asshole interviewer can shutdown a whole onsite interview process because they&#x27;re having a bad day or have some favorite question they think is the One True Question for determining if someone is a software engineer.<p>2) The software industry tends to overvalue youth.  It has a very high salary at start, but also a very quick salary cap.  And most companies have no technical ladder, and even those that do it&#x27;s a joke compared to the manager ladder.  All of this is not surprising.  Since the industry is so heavily biased towards hiring and rewarding youth, older experienced engineers are not valued.<p>3) Senior software engineers have heavy pressure to leave the software field.  I&#x27;m feeling this now.  I&#x27;m a senior at my current place and my salary is basically capped.  There would be little to no benefit going to another company.  And even if I wanted to, I have a family now and don&#x27;t have \nthe free time to study for software interviews.  My options are basically go into management, consulting, or start a business.  I have no desire to start a business or go into consulting because I simply don&#x27;t like doing those business related things.  I want to be an engineer not a business person.  But if I just stay an engineer, I will probably get laid off someday due to ageism.  And if I&#x27;m an old engineer who is laid off, job mobility is basically gone due to ageism and the CS heavy interviews that I don&#x27;t have the time or motivation to study for.  So the only safe path is management.  A lot of senior engineers face this decision.  Which again reduces the number of mentors and experienced engineers to teach the new younger engineers.<p>4) And doesn&#x27;t anyone notice just how wrong whole concept of studying for an interview is?

It is somewhat misleading to represent yourself as a &quot;Professor&quot; when you are an adjunct, non-tenure track instructor/faculty member.<p>In response to the earlier question which you also answered:<p>In general, in American Universities it goes Assistant Professor --> Associate Professor --> Professor at ~5-10 years between each step (the exact details vary depending upon discipline and University). In science, these are usually the people who are writing grants and are at the heads of labs. Usually you must be tenure-track to advise graduate students.<p>Then there may be another class of &#x27;lecturers&#x27; who are not-tenure track but are still considered faculty-members. There is not always a distinction here between lecturers and adjunct instructors, however. Lecturers&#x27; main role is usually instruction of undergraduate or graduate students.<p>Finally, there are the adjunct instructors, whose primary role is the education of undergraduates and who are paid much smaller amounts of money for their work relative to tenure-track faculty. This is a relatively newer class of University employee, and it is definitely a very difficult career. I imagine most adjuncts either have other careers or are attempting to break into the tenure-track rank, although I do no know how often this happens.<p>In addition, in science there might be &#x27;Research Scientists,&#x27; &#x27;Research professors,&quot; or &#x27;Staff Scientists&#x27; who work under a tenure-track faculty member. They are often somewhat equivalent to lecturers, except they do not instruct undergraduates but instead are usually full devoted to research. It&#x27;s essentially a &quot;Super-Post Doc,&quot; but hopefully with a salary one can reasonably live on modestly.<p>And for completeness: In science, people do Post-Docs following the completion of their PhD. They are non-faculty jobs under a tenure-track professor where one conducts full-time research, usually for 2-3 years, although some people must complete multiple Post-Docs. The usually idea is to find a faculty job after your post-doc, but I think a majority of people end up filling some ancillary position in science or leaving science entirely, because there are unfortunately many more post-docs than there are faculty positions.<p>It gets even more complicated when you add in MDs and hospitals to this academic situation.",1425862857

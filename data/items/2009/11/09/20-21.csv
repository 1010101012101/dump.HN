We can't keep false information from flowing, there's just too many excited people, too many levels of indirection and too much incentive in putting out ""cheap"" news. The point is, we have to keep in mind what sources are more likely to be reliable and what sources aren't, and we have to filter information as it comes and compare with other sources, not just blindly accept it.

At that time, a credit card was required to sign up for the free account. That has changed -- now anyone can sign up to view the application for free.<p>Perq is a web-based app for companies to create policy, and manage and track employee Paid Time Off (PTO). We created this application out of a frustration with the lack of good quality software in this niche. At Matter (www.matterco.com), we pride ourselves in our ability to create compelling User Interface and Interaction Design. Our application design strives to make the HR administrator's job easier by automating PTO leave requests. For employees, we wanted to focus employee attention on an often undervalued form of compensation, PTO. To literally highlight the value of leave time, we use a gauge metaphor to show current PTO balances, earning potential, and amounts used.<p>As both designers and developers, we are looking for more good, critical feedback. Try it out by entering your company's leave policy and let us know what you think.<p>For those interested, our application uses:<p>* Symfony PHP Framework (www.symfony-project.org) -- We found this MVC framework excellent. The code is well written and the documentation is accurate and thorough. We considered Rails, but were won over by the proven success of the LAMP stack as epitomized by DIGG, Yahoo, and Facebook.<p>* jQuery -- What a godsend... Perq relies heavily on AJAX to make the UI function fluidly. jQuery, by abstracting away cross-browser nuances, allowed more time spent developing functionality rather than fixing IE bugs.<p>* Doctrine ORM (http://www.doctrine-project.org/) -- SQL and Database design not being my strong suit, a good ORM is critical to the maintainability and performance of the application. The Doctrine syntax is excellent at grabbing records and manipulating them without spending time tweaking SQL statements.<p>* And Others... -- Our application supports calendar integration with ICS. We rely on email as a communication channel, and employed SwiftMailer (http://swiftmailer.org/). Rackspace is our host.<p>Again, your feedback and any forwarding of the link to small business or HR people who manage employee benefits is extremely appreciated.<p>-- Perq Developer",1257798322

931635,comment,931449,931597,0,0,Kirby,,,"I kind of am, but I think in reality perl and python appeal to a different enough mindset, and solve similar enough problems, that there's almost no real competition between them.  Most people will instantly like one and loathe the other based on their opinions on compiler-mandated style.  (It's not just that, but it's an immediate thing you encounter and exemplifies the philosophy through the whole language - the One True Way to do things, uniformly and consistently across programmers, or There's More Than One Way To Do It, the language accepting as many alternate ways as possible and adapting to the programmer.)<p>There exist performance benchmarks, but I tend to think they continue to trend close enough together to never be a more compelling argument than the underlying design principal, for people choosing a primary language to work in.  Similar for featureset - comparing modern releases, there's a vanishingly small set of real differences, especially if you're willing to consider best practice modules freely available.  (IE, yes, we're sorry about Perl's built-in object model, but really, we fixed that in libraries years ago, seriously guys, years.)<p>We can band together and agree that we hate java more than each other, though.",1257797380

931629,comment,913993,914587,0,0,Locke1689,,,"I disagree. At least you can ""understand"" what someone has written in another language. In fact, at the end basically everyone is speaking the same language. My experience in math is that you become <i>so</i> specialized you literally have no idea what the problem domain the other person is working on even is. The only discipline I could compare this to may be theoretical computer science, but that's basically a closely related math variant.<p>Edit: Come to think of it, literature may work. Nowadays you don't become an expert in lit, you become an expert in Shakespeare or Proust or Dostoevsky. Sometimes you may even be an expert in a single <i>work</i>. I think the problem is mitigated a little bit by the very low ratio of jargon to information. Math, on the other hand, has an entire new language to learn in each new subfield.",1257797250

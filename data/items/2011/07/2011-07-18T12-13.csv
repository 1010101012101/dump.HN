Most people haven't switched over to smart phones, so the screens are small, and the English alphabet doesn't map all that well to a cell phone keypad (compared to a QWERTY keyboard, or Hiragana on a cell phone keypad). Newer electronic dictionaries also have a stylus and do handwriting recognition. On the other hand, the Nintendo DS electronic dictionary is pretty good, and much cheaper than an equally functional .",1310993988

It got to a point where I was writing comments/replies on behalf of some people because they didn't know how to defend work. Knowing what I know about online content, it gets me wondering how much of what we read is really written by the name attached to it.<p>As for the topic of schools, I'm not bothered by it. Part of the learning in college comes from learning how to meet deadlines and get results. It's not so much about writing the paper on your own, but providing an end product to the end user. That type of skill will serve people well later in life.",1310993968

2776081,comment,2775721,2775938,3,0,buro9,,,"That really depends on what you're listening to the music on.<p>If you want to use Spotify at home and are listening on a nice stereo, then compression artifacts are very obvious in almost everything on Spotify.<p>For that reason, if I'm not listening to local music I tend to listen to KEXP's uncompressed stream. It's a mere 1.4Mbps.<p>Which then hits on why Spotify are most likely not serving 320. ""It's the bandwidth, stupid"".<p>It's all about the bandwidth. How few people are going to hear the difference, and how much would it cost to implement? The bandwidth costs are definitely non-trivial for their subscriber base, so implementing 320 is going to hit their costs hard.<p>For the article linked, notice the blog title, Spotify Classical.<p>Classical music really does show up artifacts in compression like Hip Hop, Pop and Rock (and Prog Rock) simply doesn't. The strings and low bass both exist in the upper and lower audio ranges precisely where compression is most aggressive and therefore noticeable. This isn't going to affect greatly the Beyonces of this world, but it affects some delicate string recital.<p>To be honest, if I were Spotify, I'd probably just rip the classical in 320 as that is a specialist crowd who probably can hear the difference and would kick up a stink. And then keep the vast majority in 160 as the vast majority aren't going to notice and wouldn't kick up a stink. If I wanted to be more intelligent, I'd write something to try and detect artifacts, and if a 160 file exhibited above a certain threshold, then I'd make that a contender to be at 320... thus trying to find a sweet spot between quality and bandwidth costs.",1310993952

One of the things that CoffeeScript manages to do, with greater or lesser success, is to avoid many of these ""bad parts"":<p>* Global variables can no longer be created by accident ... you must explicitly `window.global = ...` them.<p>* Semicolons are gone, along with the headaches of automatic semicolon insertion.<p>* I'm afraid that not much can be done about `typeof` without a more invasive replacement, unfortunately.<p>* The + operator continues to work the same way.<p>* CoffeeScript does not have `==` or `!=`, only `===` and `!==` for strict equality comparisons. In the one location where `==` can be helpful, checking for either null or undefined, you may use the existential operator.<p>* When dealing with too many falsy values, there's an existential operator, which allows you to ask the question: Does this value exist?

Assignments start to become harder since obviously students don't have problems with them, those that really try to be honest are finding it is more difficult to do well, while they see cheaters zoom right by them, getting As and Bs.<p>Not all classes are viewed as core classes that one needs to understand or they'll fail some future test during their interview.

It only appears to be one if you accept ""maximize accepted utility"" as the decision metric.<p>Maximizing expected utility is a pretty good decision metric, but it has problems. Specifically, it has huge problems in handling very-low-probability-very-high-payoff outcomes. Here's a simple example:<p>Game 1: You get $1.00<p>Game 2: 99.999% chance of getting nothing. 0.001% chance of getting $100,000.00<p>The expected payoff in each is the same but they are <i>clearly</i> very different.<p>Note: I realize I'm equating money with utility here. Just doing it for simplicity, you can replace with whatever you want to get a utility of 1 and 100,000 respectively.<p>Note 2: You can argue that utility is bounded (say between 0 and 1). But I don't think this solves the problem.",1270709278

Entire time I was a kid he was trying to get different businesses off the ground.  After I moved out he actually succeeded for a while, but that eventually imploded.  You see, my dad isn't a very skilled person.  He's lacking a large amount of business sense.  He's really not even very bright.  However, he's one hell of a salesman.  He could always sell the product, but couldn't keep the business together.  I saw him fail repeatedly, and learned from his examples.

1249312,comment,1248725,1249284,0,0,ismarc,,,"The way Debian manages it, only bugfixes are added once something hit's ""stable"" (current Debian 5).  This means that drivers and new versions of applications are typically frozen except for bug patches only.  Debian 5 was released a little over a year ago, leading to the software being outdated by standard desktop/consumer use compared to the number of improvements and bugs fixed in the mean time (most applications provide feature+bug releases which are not added to Debian once it hits stable).  For servers, this is reliable and actually wonderful to deal with.  For desktop/laptop systems, it can be frustrating because the code exists, and it should be nice, easy and non-broken for applications and drivers, but in reality it's not, because the release is behind.  Ubuntu's goal is to have a much quicker release cycle to keep this from happening, but in the mean time never get a system that's really 100% stable and usable.  Ubuntu also does some weird crazy hacks to get things to appear smooth to the user, when in reality they have pre-programmed guesses you can't override.  So if it doesn't work, the only recovery is seasoned Linux experience.  Debian, on the other hand, gives a large number of options making the installation not seem as smooth, but is recoverable with quick Google searches or reading of the explanations.",1270708904

Linux/OSX/Windows is a good example. Go back in time and remove any of those from the game and you get a less good present.<p>I think Apple is largely less capable then MS of holding a problematic monopoly for long (at least with their current m.o.). That would require being every thing for every person to plug all potential competition holes. That comes with hairy compromises that Apple probably won't want to make.<p>So far, Apple hasn't done any net damage. They are getting things done and moving things along fast. It will take either a real slow down in their innovation or some serious damage to flip that balance.",1270707252

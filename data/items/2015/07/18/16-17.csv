Try a thought experiment. Imagine that you <i>must</i> reduce payroll. How do you do it without a layoff? Or, let me describe just one progression of events that I&#x27;ve seen play out a few times. BigCo acquires LittleCo after LittleCo starts killing BigCo with the new fancy LittleCo process/machine. The buyout terms required all LittleCo employees to be hired by BigCo. BigCo doesn&#x27;t really care about these new folks, but BigCo promised, so BigCo tries to work them into the fold, and creates group &quot;B&quot; for them. BigCo also has its own internal group &quot;A&quot; of people who were doing the same thing as the folks from LittleCo, but who weren&#x27;t killing it. BigCo starts shuffling people from &quot;A&quot; to &quot;B&quot; and &quot;B&quot; to &quot;A&quot; or vice-versa, whichever is more convenient; until they have the smart people and cool kids in one group, and the rest of the people in the other. Now, what do you propose will happen to now non-performing group filled with people most of whom may not be fired or laid-off? At BigCo, what happens is that the group of step-children gets a new chief and new &quot;Project Managers&quot;. These new leaders are sticklers for the rules though, and have their own ideas about every detail of working at BigCo from breaks & start & stop time, to parking spaces, to TPS reports, and other policies and procedures; and through the power of micro-management they are going to get the group into ship-shape, and do great things at BigCo!!! The new Vogon leadership never seem to get much work for the group though, and for those reasons, morale takes a dive. Then, lo and behold within a short time most of the step-children start getting the hint and either flee to a competitor, form another LittleCo, find a new line of work, or some combination of those things. How many times would you need to see a similar gambit play out for you to question whether maybe it happens that way by design?",1437238672

9908050,comment,9907520,9907520,0,0,nickpsecurity,,,"It&#x27;s better to read the papers where they attempt provable security and then those published years later reviewing that work or those methods. Certain methods worked well, some failed over time, and so on. The lessons learned and looking back papers are where I find the most wisdom in this field. Naturally.<p>The papers on Orange Book-era B3 and A1 class systems along with the Common Criteria EAL6/EAL7 works taught me the most. They all required a clear, security policy and a strong argument the design/implementation embody it. The systems are modular, layered, internally simple, use structured programming style, use safer subsets of programming languages, often are state-machines, account for failure modes for everything, and trace each potential execution flow of the system. They also add, where possible, static analysis and covert channel analysis. Some did formal proofs but the above gets you 90-99% of the way.<p>So, the idea is that you design the system or algorithm in such a way that you can easily demonstrate it has certain properties. It was hard work. However, LOCK project even with proofs only cost around 30-40% extra on top of solid, development process. Another lesson is the specs, implementation, and proofs/arguments should always evolve side-by-side with plenty of communication between team members. This spots problems early. Analysis of various phases showed above methods caught all kinds of reliability and security flaws in actual systems with many doing excellent during years of pentesting. Proof themselves, on other hand, should only be used if the property is easy to model mathematically. Otherwise, you use a lot of effort with little gained. Final lesson came from TCB concept: focus all your provable security on mechanisms that are flexible and simple so the cost is spread over all projects benefiting from it. Security & separation kernels did this to a degree but I think CompCert compiler is best, modern example of ROI on high-assurance development.",1437238570

9908030,comment,9906107,9906107,0,0,deelowe,,,"I guess I&#x27;m going to out myself a bit here, but I feel the need to clarify a few things. Full disclosure. I&#x27;m a people manager in TI and have been for a long time.<p>First off, I knew Erica a few years ago when she worked in our local office. She&#x27;s a wonderful person and I hate that she&#x27;s had such bad experiences. I don&#x27;t know the full details, but I do know that one of the orgs she was in went through a lot of stuff early on. These are the typical startup is becoming a big company type of issues. They ended up letting people go, reorging the team, getting new managers, letting others go, etc... It was a major shake-up. I wonder how this impacted her. I know she transferred around the time all of this was happening (as did a lot of people in that team) and she became very outspoken. Her interpretation of what happened seems to indicate that she thought she was targeted. I don&#x27;t know if this is the case, but I wonder if it was more of a team wide issue at the time than something specific with her. Also, it didn&#x27;t help that we didn&#x27;t have a regional HR person at the time, so whatever Erica was going through at the time was probably left unrecognized as she had no one to talk to about it. The company was growing fast and satellite offices were more of an afterthought at the time. Keep in mind the context. Google went from a couple thousand to like 60k employees in just a few years. There were growing pains all over the place and we certainly felt it in the remote offices. Especially when it came things like HR, benefits, etc...<p>I saw the salary spreadsheet. On the surface it seemed alarming. Especially to people who made assumptions about pay at Google. Here&#x27;s some context. Again, I don&#x27;t know any details about what&#x27;s going on with Erica&#x27;s department. This is just what I see on my end of things (I&#x27;m not in SRE, but am under the same VP).<p>First off, location is a big factor due to needing to be competitive in a particular region. Secondly, performance impacts both raises and the rate you come in at after promotion. People with good ratings tend to get better base pay. Yearly bonuses get a performance multiplier as well. Managers can see all of these factors (base pay, proposed adjustment for raises and promotions, multipler, etc...) We get insight into this during our salary planning process which happens twice a year for promotions and once a year for non-promo. The constants that are used for base pay are all decided based on a formula and in my experience it&#x27;s completely fair and consistent. The formula literally takes a base pay for a particular job ladder, level, and region and then adds an adjustment for performance. Bonus is calculated as a flat % against pay + a multiplier for annual performance. There is no bias in this as it&#x27;s all done via software. As a manager, I can do some small adjustments here and there, but it&#x27;s usually at most a percentage or maybe two. It would be very difficult for me to directly influence someone&#x27;s pay by say 10% or so. I don&#x27;t think managers or bias in performance management is the primary cause for pay dependencies. Slight, yes, but not huge differences.<p>So how do people end up with such huge pay differences? Well, a few ways.<p>1) Google&#x27;s job ladders and pay scales were kind of screwed up for a while. In one case I remember, people were adjusted by over 10% (up) in a given year, because the company realized they had the market rate set incorrectly. Google generally doesn&#x27;t adjust salaries down, so if you got lucky early on and came in at a high salary, it sticks until something changes it (e.g. promo). There were a lot of people who got &quot;lucky&quot; as job ladders and market rates were refined over time. Keep in mind that Google went through all this during the great recession. There are a lot of factors here. In general, pay varied a lot early on. There are a lot of people in SRE who still have these inconsistencies reflected in their base pay.<p>2) Hiring negotiations. We all know this is an issue. Some people are very good at this and can get a huge difference of pay coming in. I won&#x27;t go into details here as I feel it&#x27;s probably a bit confidential, but I do see big differences in pay due to the negotiation skills of the person getting hired. Note that Google has tried to fix this lately by not negotiating base pay as much, but it still happens and was a bigger issue historically. In general, the higher the level, the more this is an issue.<p>3) Ladder/job transfers. Again, Google doesn&#x27;t like to adjust people&#x27;s pay down, so if someone transfers from one job type to another, they may come in making significantly more than what is typical for the new job. There are some rules in place to prevent this, but they aren&#x27;t stringent enough to completely eliminate it as extremely tight rules would make transfers nearly impossible. Note that Google encourages transfers across ladders and teams.<p>4) Tenure (raises). If someone stays in a position for a long time and consistently performs well, but doesn&#x27;t get promoted, they may see their pay go up more (within the range for their ladder) as they get raises year over year. That said, I don&#x27;t see this very much as usually someone who performs consistently well will get promoted, but there are some cases like when an individual refuses to put themselves up for promotion or they are at the top of their job ladder and can&#x27;t get promoted.<p>And of course, there&#x27;s a lot of other things that could be possible for people who&#x27;ve been with the company more than 5 or 6 years. In the early post IPO days, there was a lot of chaos. There were jobs without ladders, weird things with contractor conversions, very little consistently across eng teams, etc... It was a bit wild west like. HR was a bit of a mess back then too. Again, since pay doesn&#x27;t usually get adjusted down, you&#x27;ll see these inconsistencies and on the surface, they&#x27;ll look odd. Typically, if you dig a little deeper though, there&#x27;s a good reason.<p>Alright, so back to the spreadsheet. Ah... the infamous spreadsheet. This just seems like it has bad news written all over it. Here&#x27;s how this thing came to be. An email went out and basically said &quot;hey, put your pay into this sheet.&quot; Now, please note that the person who sent it had been pretty vocal previously about bias, unfairness, etc. I&#x27;m pretty sure there might be some selection bias in this methodology... Also, Google spreadsheets tracks revision history, so nothing was anonymous. When I looked it over, I didn&#x27;t really see anything alarming to be honest. There certainly inconsistencies, but they seemed to be linked to the issues I mentioned above. The biggest factor seemed to be location. Note that this spreadsheet was shared PUBLICALLY for a while. The whole way this was done wasn&#x27;t that great. I don&#x27;t take issue with the concept, but I personally found the way this was conducted a bit unprofessional. An anonymized survey would have been much better.<p>Finally, let&#x27;s talk about bonuses (outside of annual bonus). There are ways for people to give bonuses to others at Google for deeds they deem to be outside of normal work duties. Typically these are things like assisting with something that&#x27;s not part of one&#x27;s job ladder, helping with volunteer projects, or having significant impact on a large project. The amount of review these bonuses receive depends on the dollar amount. Peer bonuses are a relatively small fixed amount. Anyone can award them to anyone else and they only require manager approval. By design there is little guidance and oversight. How these get awarded is EXTREMELY inconsistent, but so far the company seems to be somewhat ok with this given that they are a very small amount. My policy (and the general guidance) is that they should be for small efforts that are outside the scope of the individual&#x27;s job ladder. These are like 1-2 day things here and there. Not large project contributions and not for things that someone is consistently doing. If the individual is performing something consistently, then we are expected to reflect that in the persons performance reviews so that it gets factored into their yearly bonus and annual pay increase. Hopefully the reason for this makes sense (hint: it&#x27;s better for the individual).<p>Finally, I also don&#x27;t think I would have approved peer bonuses for what was done with this spreadsheet. Not because of the fact that these individuals collected people&#x27;s pay, but because their methods were very poor. I&#x27;m pretty sure all it did was anger or confuse people. Why not collect the data anonymously, rope in an analytics team, do an analysis, control for bias etc.. and then present at a CFR or even all hands? I find it hard to believe that anyone would push back on this at Google.",1437238050

We are not passive recipients of sensation trapped in Plato&#x27;s cave, but active intervenors in the world who learn about the universe by being causes.<p>&quot;According to Piaget, the origin of spatial representation coincides with the origin of drawing, language and representational thinking in general. In spite of their common development, drawing soon falls behind the mental conception of space (especially in the case of complex and three-dimensional constructions). Yet, in its simplest and earliest appearances, drawing should be conceived as the representation or even the motor of spatial conception, because—here Piaget quotes his teacher, the philosopher of mathematics Léon Brunschvicg—drawing is not founded on geometry, but on the contrary, geometry is founded on the practice of drawing. <i>If one explains the origins of geometry as arising from drawing, the child’s drawing can indeed be operationalized as a reconstruction apparatus of the psychogenesis of space.</i> If one understands drawing in this way, it does not record an independent process of development, rather it documents and reflects its own developmental conditions—and thereby furthers mental ontogeny. Children’s drawings are able to visualize geometric conceptions because they are one of its main motors. The drawing child constitutes a veritable machine that works on the production of a Euclidean future, because—as Piaget detected in his experiments—it helps to complete and partly to conceal the infant’s older tacit topological knowledge.&quot; (emphasis added) -- <a href=""http://www.mpiwg-berlin.mpg.de/en/news/features/feature11"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.mpiwg-berlin.mpg.de/en/news/features/feature11</a><p>I am not in any sense a strict Piagetian, and I realized there has been a lot of work done on this topic since, but I use this as an example simply because his empirical investigations were foundational and should have brought us to the point where everyone recognizes that philosophical imaginings are not a useful way to approach any question whatsoever regarding the development of ideas, even when they are the imaginings of someone as clever as Kant, whom as others here have pointed out, Poincare&#x27; was channeling.<p>The imagination is a terrible guide to what is real: we can imagine all kinds of things that can&#x27;t exist (the god of the Bible, for example) and can&#x27;t imagine all kinds of things that do exist (whatever lies behind quantum phenomena, say).<p>Philosophers (and at times mathematicians) like to sweep away the messy empirical realities that actually give rise to our ideas of geometry and everything else.

9907920,comment,9892970,9896208,0,0,zanny,,,"> inflation requires individuals and companies to grow to maintain value, that is potentially unsustainable.<p>Are you talking about currency inflation or economic inflation? If a companies assets are appreciating against currency due to inflation, then that is in and of itself the growth aspect of competing with inflation. Nothing about an inflating money means anything needs to grow, it just means if you are holding dollars you are losing value. So just don&#x27;t hold dollars.<p>It is bad because hoarded money might as well not exist. It exits the monetary system and effectively deflates the monetary base and reduces monetary velocity because its exited transactions for however long the holder wishes to take it out of circulation. Of course, it is really hard to even imagine a situation where you could do this with traditional fiat - unless you stuff it in a suitcase and hide it in your wall, you don&#x27;t put money in any bank and not have fractional reserve banking done with it.<p>> Because everyone is yoked together by leveraging, a catastrophic event, say, a tsunami in seattle, will domino over such that the individuals depending on the fractional reserve of the victim&#x27;s holdings will then be forced into default, and those dependent on them, and so on and so forth via the multiplier effect.<p>You need to distinguish between that fractional reserve banking model and inflationary high velocity money. With cryptocurrencies you pretty much cannot do fractional reserve banking, because you cannot unspend transactions and the entire transaction history is perfectly transparent. I mean you could, but your users could then track their money through everyone you loan it to, and you cannot loan out more than you have. It would at the least be a very different beast from our current model of &quot;trust us, your money is &#x27;safe&#x27;&quot;. Unless you are on a deflationary or otherwise static currency like gold backed dollars your assets are just not in that currency.<p>And that works fine with a reactionary inflationary cryptocurrency. Nothing stops you from using bitcoin as a wealth trap like gold, where you just take its scarcity and the value of its network to provide value to the depreciating resource. Throw your inflationary coins into bitcoin, and then sit on bitcoin, there is your gold hoard. The point is that the inflationary currency then changes hands, and the whole point of a modern money is for it to be spent. If you discretize the store of value from the unit of exchange you avoid all the issues mingling them togther.<p>> it managed to survive a massive civil war that tore apart the nation and not 40 years later it was basically one of the world powers.<p>The Civil War increased Union national debt fifty times over, from about 60 million to 2.8 billion. It was an unprecedented amount of bond issuance and international loans that has still never been paid off. You would be surprised how well nations can weather spending a lot of money - they can get some of the best loans out there, after all, either from their citizens or from other nations. You don&#x27;t borrow 15 trillion dollars, ask for another trillion, and get anyone lining up to take that offer anywhere unless you are the USA.<p>> non-inflationary system cannot handle an catastrophe<p>They can handle catastrophe, you can even postulate they handle it better since you don&#x27;t need to liquidate assets to an inflationary money if you just hoard the cash. Its about everything that is not a catastrophe, the daily operations of the economy, and a deflationary currency turns a normal day <i>into</i> a catastrophe when people stop using their money because they want to hoard it in a safe. That depresses the whole economy and slows down everything when you are not aiming for maximal monetary velocity. Your currency is not the place to store wealth, its meant to be the transactional unit of goods and service exchange, and trying to make it do more than one job makes it do all its jobs poorly.",1437236067

The only difference is replacing &quot;,<i>&quot; with &quot;]+&quot;, which is not any different for your </i>eye* to read.<p>What you mistake for readability is familiarity: after you read a word you need to associate a meaning with it. It takes longer to interpret the meaning of things you didn&#x27;t see before while grabbing a meaning from a cache is nearly instantaneous. You understood this difference in comprehension speed as a readability difference.<p>My main point is that it makes no sense to talk about readability without first getting used to the grammar and vocabulary of a language. In this case, it&#x27;s unfamiliar feature in an otherwise normal environment, but it gets worse. There are people who believe they can judge the readability of entirely alien (to them) languages and it hurts those languages reputation pretty badly.

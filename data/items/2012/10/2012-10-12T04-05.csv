In the end someone has to pay in order for tv-shows to be produced and producers have rights. You cant just decide to own something if you did not pay for it one way or another , or it is called stealing. And because it is easy to do so doesnt mean it is legal or it is moral. Nothing is free down this world. But torrent sites are making money with the traffic they generate with the content they illegaly distribute. They create revenue by destroying a lot of value.",1350017948

It's one thing for Louis CK to gamble $0.2M on a DRM-free standup special, and another for Disney to gamble $220M on a DRM-free Avengers.<p>> How is this any different from the situation right now with DVDs and Blu-rays? You can copy videos very easily.<p>Nerds can, but DVD ripping is still much less friendly to regular people compared to MP3 swapping, and requires much more work to play back compared to iPods and CD burning. If the industry ever got behind open standards, eventually many more people would pirate movies instead of just college kids. Borrowing a DVD from a friend would be no different than taking it permanently, resulting in fewer total sales.<p>Don't get me wrong: DRM is a plague. Hell, I'd even support a tax that made all content part of a universal digital library, with funds distributed proportionally to usage. But without somehow creating a new economic system for digital content, every ""rational actor"" is going to do whatever they can to maintain maximum leverage. The only reason the RIAA caved was that the damage was already done, and they had lost most of their leverage already. (Also, it was something of a ploy to give Amazon an advantage over iTunes, which was enjoying a brief hegemony over paid music downloads; user freedom was a happy side effect.)",1350017852

Also, the variable name ""prevNode"" is misleading because it is not the previous node, it's the link from the previous node to the current node. Let's change it to ""prevLink"".<p>For the first iteration through your loop,<p><pre><code>    prevLink = &list_head
    currNode = list_head
</code></pre>
Second,<p><pre><code>    prevLink = list_head->next
    currNode = list_head  /* (again) */
</code></pre>
Third,<p><pre><code>    prevLink = list_head->next->next
    currNode = list_head->next
</code></pre>
In other words, from the second iteration on, prevLink is actually nextLink, that is, currNode->next.<p>Here's my take:<p><pre><code>    typedef struct node {
        /* ...some fields... */
        struct node *next;
    } Node;
    
    void foobar(Node *node_list)
    {
        Node **prev_link;
        Node *current_node;
        Node *list_head = node_list;
        
        for (current_node = list_head, prev_link = &list_head;
            current_node != NULL;
            prev_link = &(current_node->next), current_node = *prev_link)
        {
            /* ...do something... */
            if (must_remove(current_node)) {
                *prev_link = current_node->next;
                free(current_node);
            }
        }
    }
</code></pre>
This code compiles with no warnings, so it must be perfect. :)<p>The beauty of it is that by doing it this way, you don't need to special-case the list head at all. You could do something like foobar(&(actual_list_head->next)) and have foobar() run on every element except the first one, and it would just work.",1350016632

I don't run any of these them, but I think diversity is important and it'd be a disaster if all of these more niche distributions vanished simply because users aren't able to install them any more.<p>So it's important to come up with a solution that allows end users to choose which software they want to run. To Microsoft's credit, they added a requirement that it be possible to reconfigure the key database on x86 systems after the outcry that accompanied their initial announcements. But the UI for that is wildly inconsistent between vendors, and sometimes even between different ranges from the same vendor. HP's consumer laptops need keys to be stored in one format, HP's enterprise laptops in another. It's a significant barrier to entry, especially amongst users with less technical expertise.<p>The Linux Foundation's approach attempts to handle that, by presenting a simple UI whenever you attempt to boot. Hit y and it'll run whatever you want. But the problem here is that it intrinsically classes Linux as a second-class citizen. Linux becomes the OS that can't reboot itself. It's the OS that pops up an ugly text entry box every time you turn your computer on. It's the OS that asks you if you're sure you want to run potentially insecure code. 10 years of progress in making Linux accessible to users, gone.<p>Suse came up with a more elegant approach, and we've been building on that in Fedora. The current version of Shim (so called because it wedges itself into Microsoft's trust model and bridges it into a different trust model) has bootloader-level UI that permits the user to enrol a key or a bootloader hash. If the second-stage bootloader is signed by a key it trusts, it'll simply boot that. If it's not, it'll fall back to a 10-second timeout that lets the user drop to a menu and modify their key database. If the distribution ships a signing key, they can enrol the public key. If not, they can enrol a hash of the bootloader. Afterwards, the system will boot. Post-install, it'll still boot. No dialog. No sitting there forever waiting for user interaction. One single extra step in the install process, and it's completely consistent no matter what hardware you're running on.<p>I think this is a wildly better solution. Big distributions with the ability to support industry expectations around secure boot can ship something that installs without any additional user interaction. Smaller distributions or end-users who want to use their own modified bootloader or kernel can enrol their key in a single step and not worry about it in future. It's not quite as easy as ""press y"", but it's something you do once and then your computer Just Works.<p>It's unfortunate that the Linux Foundation ended up taking this approach, because it's going to be perceived as the official Linux response despite it being completely different to what every Linux distribution working on this problem has implemented. Now we have to deal with a perception that Linux will only work with Secure Boot as long as you never reboot, which couldn't be further from the truth.",1350015926

Yes.<p>But think a bit about the bigger picture here - do you want to make a career out of this? And if so, where do you want to go with it?

It's also in a bit of the middle ground - all the way at the front of the ""web stack"" code-wise, and also very closely related to design.<p>no_more_death suggests that you bone up on design and gradually learn to code.

If you're looking to make a career at larger companies, or want to focus more on short-term job prospects, I'd suggest you pick one of the two - buckle down on learning either design or code.<p>What compels you about HTML/CSS? Is it the logic of boiling down visual concepts into their fundamental parts? If so, start playing with Javascript (with a jQuery cushion) to see how you can manipulate these parts in all sorts of ways, and go down the code rabbit hole. If you're more into the visual side of it, the creativity of being able to come up with any design you like and turn it into a website, start messing around in Photoshop and checking out some design resources online (see no_more_death's extensive list).<p>In any case, good luck, and let me know if you have any more questions.

Byte-addressed but word-aligned pointers plus pipelining and superscalar processors (branch prediction probably helps too) give you almost the same performance as explicit instructions for tag support. The amount of flexibility and the simplification in the instruction set you get from it is well worth it IMO. SPARC had such instructions, and on benchmarks (see <a href=""http://www.cs.ucsb.edu/~urs/oocsb/papers/oo-hardware.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cs.ucsb.edu/~urs/oocsb/papers/oo-hardware.html</a> and <a href=""http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~ram/pub/arch.ps"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~ram/pub/arch.ps</a>) the difference in speed between using them and not was less than 5%.<p>On a 64-bit machine, you have 30 different tags available (5 tag bits, since the smallest thing you'd want to point at is going to be two 64-bit words big, and two of the 5-bit patterns reserved for positive and negative fixnums, for 60-bit immediate integers).<p>The problem is a lot of algorithms (especially crypto) are designed around 32 or 64 bit words, which typically means you have to make contortions and declarations to have your compiler operate on immediate representations. Typically, the compiler will set aside some registers on the CPU for dealing with these immediate values, so the garbage collector doesn't get confused. On x86 this might mean you don't have enough registers to run the algorithm efficiently, even if the compiler knows exactly what needs to be unboxed.<p>Another problem is floating point values. On 64-bit systems there's a technique called NaN-boxing that can do something about this (<a href=""http://wingolog.org/archives/2011/05/18/value-representation-in-javascript-implementations"" rel=""nofollow"">http://wingolog.org/archives/2011/05/18/value-representation...</a>), but I don't yet understand how it works.<p>I do agree on one thing - slapping an extra byte onto word size would be awesome, as long as that extra byte is general purpose. Other things besides tagging that you could do with it would be error-correcting codes (the Symbolics Ivory actually had ECC for every word), and all kinds of metadata. Maybe it would even make sense to keep this extra byte out of the memory bus and just have it on registers; that's where most of the trouble with tagged values on modern machines seems to come from.

Similarly, the underlying library could gradually get type annotations, as Erlang has been doing progressively for the past year or two. As more and more code gets annotated, you can ""lift"" that knowledge into any code that calls, for instance, String.substr(), and assert that the types match when they are provided.<p>To me it seems that even the complications caused by multiple types of arguments to many built-in functions would be less complex to resolve at runtime than the hairy, ""lazy"" logic they're referring to in this article.<p>Iterating through an array of type specs and resolving the correct underlying code (only in the specific case of annotated functions being invoked - usually 'hot path' code that has a simple breadth and call structure for other performance reasons), throwing an error if there's no match, seems easier than Hidden Classes, in my admittedly naive view.",1350015167

So, I invented my own :)<p>IIRC I packed each character into 6 bits, using the first 26 values for A-Z, and the rest of the values for the common 2-3 grams that I found in the back of a dictionary in the local library. I had some other scheme for building words from stem + suffixes (eg flood, flooded).<p>What I learned the most from that experience was mostly around reverse-engineering and perseverance. I had to figure out what the 1541 drive did by disassembling its ROM and following the boot sequence. When comparing it to a 2040 drive (a older dual drive variant that was much more expensive - something like $2500 in 1981 dollars) I knew quite a bit about the sector interleave spacing - the disk could do sustained 2 sector reads per revolution. So I knew there was room for improvement if I could just get the transfer rate between the disk and the C-64 to go faster. I did that by improving how it transferred bits down the wire. To cut costs, Commodore had a serial interface vs. the parallel IEEE-488 interface used in the 2040 / Commodore PETs of the previous generation. They had a super inefficient algorithm where they did a handshake for every bit that went down the wire. This was due to the VIC chip in the C-64 stealing cycles from the 6510 CPU whenever it needed to read from shared RAM. Since they weren't clever enough to figure out when the VIC chip would steal cycles they did a handshake for every bit.<p>I improved this by asynchronously transferring 2 bits at a time using the clock and the data lines for ~3 bytes. I could read a register on the VIC chip that would tell me what scan line was being processed and from that I could tell when the VIC chip would steal the bus. Also on the vertical flyback I would be able to transfer bits with impunity.<p>This speed boost made it possible for me to hit the interleave on the disk and get the transfer back up to ~25Kbps.<p>These were pretty low level hacks (that worked quite well) to get things to go fast. Not sure how any of that transfers to the things we do today. One thing's for sure, I don't think I'll ever understand a modern computer as well as I understood those computers of my childhood.<p>The spell checker was completely IO bound. The 1541 stored ~170KB of data. The words on disk were sorted and I generated a unique sorted list of words in memory. It was, at the time the fastest spell checker for the Commodore 64, it was packaged with a popular word processor of the time called WordPro 64. Most of the other spell checkers had much smaller dictionaries and took a LONG time to read the disk. I could read 170KB in something like 70s, which, using my data transfer improvements was 5x faster than any other spell checker at the time. I'm pretty sure I had more words in my dictionary too. But things are a bit fuzzy - that was nearly 30 years ago!",1350014442

* Depth is essential for a design that takes your client's breath away. Here's a great article about John 
Harris's use of depth and scale.<p><pre><code>  > http://colorcubic.com/2010/09/07/the-science-fiction-art-of-john-harris/

* Stunning graphics is more likely to get you a job than user interface design. But UI design (or UX ""user 
experience"") is arguably more important. The following articles will get you started.<p><pre><code>  > Designing better interfaces: http://www.slideshare.net/Wolfr/designing-better-user-interfaces

_________________________<p>Coding Links (Mostly JavaScript):<p>* Good jQuery resource:<p><pre><code>  > http://jqfundamentals.com/book/index.html
</code></pre>
* Great first taste of how Javascript looks and feels:<p><pre><code>  > http://ejohn.org/apps/learn/
</code></pre>
* Lots of skills you should eventually try to master:<p><pre><code>  > http://rmurphey.com/blog/2012/04/12/a-baseline-for-front-end-developers/
</code></pre>
* The ShopTalk podcast and the CSS Tricks blog could be a good first step from CSS to hard-core 
programming. However, after looking at your submissions, I'm pretty sure you already know these people.<p>* After you've played around with some jQuery, you should learn javascript from the ground up.<p><pre><code>  > http://eloquentjavascript.net/contents.html
</code></pre>
* Doug Crockford is a very famous (and influential) javascript guru. Please Note: he's extremely 
opinionated and assertive! You've met people like this in real life and you know that they are usually too 
one-sided. He's got good things to say, but keep an open mind.<p><pre><code>  > Book: Javascript: The Good Parts (find it on Amazon)

  > Helpful Crockford articles: http://javascript.crockford.com/
</code></pre>
* Six months from now, when you've mastered Crockford's way of doing things, try opening your mind and reading the following. Indeed, a lot of (closed-minded) people would shoot me for suggesting these links, but they show that the standard advice isn't always true.<p><pre><code>  > Javascript doesn't need semicolons most of the time: http://stackoverflow.com/a/1028684

  > The with statement can be useful: http://stackoverflow.com/a/1028684

  > Using JS Function() to increase performance: https://github.com/felixge/faster-than-c#examples
</code></pre>
* Good resources for keeping up to date on JavaScript:<p><pre><code>  > Mozilla Dev Hacks (unfortunately they are overly pro-Firefox): https://hacks.mozilla.org/

  > Google's blog: http://blog.chromium.org/

  > Sorry the site title is kind of vulgar, but the content is excellent: http://badassjs.com
</code></pre>
* I could include a million javascript frameworks and plugins. However, I recommend that you don't start with these frameworks right away. It's easy to get blown away by the complexity. Learn core javascript. Get experience building your own stuff, learn that you need more structure, experiment with different ways of structuring your code. Then try BackboneJS.<p><pre><code>  > http://backbonejs.org

And that the president (Obama or Bush) is purposely trying to destroy the country. It is like two people in a marriage that has gone bad. Is there any way to fix it?<p>My two cents is that a place to start is to try to make a single news source that both sides can read, to help us try to get on the same page. The news source would have to not generate viewers by inciting them to anger. Maybe some thing like a newspaper but with peer reviewed articles by people from both sides?",1452473915
10878139,comment,10877616,10877955,0,0,potatolicious,,,"I suppose that depends on your definition of &quot;seriously&quot;.<p>There is a general cooling off, not a collapse. There aren&#x27;t many companies going under entirely, which is distinctly unlike the first dotcom bubble where after the pop the ground was littered with the corpses of companies.<p>IMO what we&#x27;re likely to see is a slowdown in early-stage startup hiring. Series-A and B funding is already harder to come by, and so execs will be more conservative about burn rate, including on payroll. Unicorns will continue to hire aggressively, but their equity will look worse and worse as their valuations get cut or they get murdered in the aftermath of their own IPO.<p>I think we will continue to see major unicorns have their valuations slashed, and we will continue to see tech stocks struggle in the public markets. But this will impact employee compensation more than it will impact overall demand for new hires. What this probably will mean is that offers from unicorns will be less attractive next to offers from BigTechCo, but ultimately we&#x27;re still talking about offers in the top 10% of the entire USA, so it&#x27;s hardly a cause for panic.<p>And of course the juggernauts of AmaGooFaceSoft and co. will continue to hire like crazy.<p>So yeah, the job market will get a bit softer, so you might be facing tougher competition, but it&#x27;s not exactly doom and gloom.<p>It&#x27;s certainly still a better outlook than what you were facing in electrical engineering.",1452473904

I can tell you the dotcom crash was much more devastating for the tech community since we were at the center of it.

10878136,comment,10872926,10877999,0,0,TeMPOraL,,,"The &quot;Other side&quot; is many things. Some are scared, as you point out. Others simply don&#x27;t believe authorities anymore. They had their trust broken enough many times, and so they assume that anything that&#x27;s being pushed on them is someone&#x27;s corrupt attempt at making money.<p>A good example would be anti-vaccination movement. If you talk to them and try to actually listen, it becomes clear that it&#x27;s not about science at all. It&#x27;s about the background assumption that (corrupt people in) governments and corporation seek to make money and don&#x27;t mind hurting ordinary people in the process. Mainstream science is obviously in cahoots with the corporations and/or the government.<p>Obviously, throwing papers at anti-vaxx crowd doesn&#x27;t work. Science is already complicated enough that most people can&#x27;t really grasp the details of things they hadn&#x27;t spend years on studying. People on both sides - a lot of pro-vaccination people trying to explain science to antivaxxers are actually fooling themselves by thinking they understand what they&#x27;re talking about. They may be saying the right words, but often for totally wrong reasons.<p>What&#x27;s most scary in this is that the &quot;Other side&quot; is totally justified in their lack of trust. I mean - between media exposing corrupt politicians and doctors every day, companies trying to scam you on everything, and several fields of science turning out to be mostly made of bullshit - I sometimes wonder why do <i>I</i> trust the mainstream opinion. I like to tell myself it&#x27;s because of the general knowledge and broad understanding of scientific principles I acquired over the years that let me sanity-check claims. But honestly, a big part of it may be simply because I grew up to trust authorities, and my trust hasn&#x27;t been destroyed completely yet.",1452473872

Not that I believe unionization and a further regulated industry is the answer either.<p>While I&#x27;ll defend markets to death in most other areas, there are admittedly a few industries where it the corrective benefits of competition/market pricing just doesn&#x27;t make sense. Healthcare is the perfect example of where abiding strictly by these incentives create perverse side-effects which ultimately create a net-negative environment for the industry and the consumers.<p>Living in Canada has given me perspective on this matter, where our public health insurance system functions very well without markets.<p>It&#x27;s a shame politics drives everyone to think they should be purists on each matter. Sometimes the data and emotional experience will demonstrates otherwise. Or worse, politics often create a muddled middle-of-the-road compromise, easily manipulated by either-side&#x27;s special interests.<p>It takes quite a bit of self-delusion to believe a particular economic theory should be applied uniformly everywhere when results show otherwise.",1452473580

You may want to check out MariaDB, a fork of MySQL by the original creator if you haven&#x27;t heard of it.  Postgres also finally just added upsert (INSERT ON DUPLICATE ...), which might be the last real barrier to migrating from MySQL, so if you don&#x27;t have a ton of lingering MySQL-specific knowledge, you might want to start with Postgres, as it seems to be the default in a lot of FOSS situations these days.<p>There&#x27;s certainly been lots of innovation in server-side web frameworks and ORMs in PHP and Perl since the 90s.  I can&#x27;t speak to Perl but Slim is a good PHP microframework and Propel is a nice ORM, though there are also more heavy-duty frameworks such as Laravel.<p>If you don&#x27;t mind learning a new language, I would recommend Python for any backend web development that doesn&#x27;t require squeezing out as low response times as possible, which gives you the excellent Flask + SQLAlchemy, or Django if you prefer a little more hand-holding.<p>You can still use JavaScript to add interactivity without making a SPA.  jQuery, Backbone, and React would do that in increasing levels of abstraction.<p>In the grand scheme of things, the changes to HTML/CSS since the 90s have been relatively small.  If you use Bootstrap you might not even have to worry about them too much.<p>In summary,<p>- MySQL or Postgres<p>- Generate HTML server-side starting with a PHP or Python microframework and ORM, upgrade to a batteries-included framework if you discover you need it<p>- Use Bootstrap<p>- add interactivity with jQuery or (if you want to learn it) React (React-Bootstrap is nice); switch to full SPA if you discover you need it (in that case you&#x27;ll probably want react-router, SystemJS, and JSPM)<p>- use Heroku or equivalent to avoid system administration<p>- with the combination of cross-browser libraries (jQuery, React) and the latest versions of all the popular browsers having fewer and fewer inconsistencies, you actually don&#x27;t need to worry too much about how to support multiple browsers unless you want to support really old browsers that only make up a few percent usage share combined.",1452473499

That code is then assigned a relative value unit (RVU) to determine the amount of &quot;work&quot; each code represents.  The RVU itself has three components--Physician Work, Practice Expense, and (expected) Malpractice Expense.<p>These arrive at some number or RVUs.  To then determine compensation, CMS (and insurers) use the following formula:<p>[(Work RVU * Work GPCI) + (Facility or Non-Facility PE RVU * PE GPCI) + (MP RVU * MP GPCI)] * [Conversion Factor adjusted for budget neutrality] = $Compensation for a given CPT.<p>GPCI - Geographic Price Cost Index, and represents a regional adjustment for a given cost of services.<p>------------------------------------------<p>The Post article acts like it&#x27;s some big conspiracy that the RVU numbers haven&#x27;t really changed much as if that&#x27;s the reason healthcare costs are rising so rapidly.  Except, the RVU itself doesn&#x27;t determine the compensation.  The values of a single RVU is determined arbitrarily by Medicare and Insurers.  The whole point of the RVU committee is the make sure that all various parts of medicine are weighted according to some arbitrary value scale.  You shouldn&#x27;t expect Colonoscopies to suddenly become worth less RVUs just as time progresses.  The &quot;value&quot; provided by a colonoscopy as technology progresses possibly counteracts the decrease in costs.  I can tell you in Radiology that more resolution = more things to evaluate and = requires time to interpret the study despite a study acquisition time now in seconds.<p>CMS changing how much each RVU is worth is what determines what gets paid out.

Box Office Mojo has data on 702 movies released in 2014 (I only wanted to do one year because there&#x27;s no API I know of for this and I was doing it quickly, I chose 2014 instead of 2015 because there&#x27;s still many 2015 releases that are still earning money and so I wanted the most recent &quot;complete&quot; year). The correlation between total box office gross and theaters shown in is very robust, at .79. So if you look at the top Metacritic movie from 2014, Boyhood, you can see it has a low gross, ranked 100th on Box Office Mojo&#x27;s data. But if you look at the theaters shown in, it was only in 775 theaters. Mr. Turner, the second movie on Metacritic&#x27;s rankings for 2014, was only shown in 120 theaters. Birdman, the Best Picture winner and the 16th ranked movie on Metacritic&#x27;s list, was in 1213 theaters. Meanwhile, you have to go to the 21st movie on the top grossing list to find a film that was in fewer than 3,000 theaters. It&#x27;s a classic example of Simpson&#x27;s paradox[1]. You have two populations, wide-release movies and small-release pictures, and within each population, there&#x27;s a positive correlation between critical approval (as measured by Metacritic) and box office gross, which is picked up by the contour maps. But because the highest Metacritic scores go to the movies released in 2000 theaters or less, without controlling for the number of theaters a movie shows in, it looks like there&#x27;s a negative relationship between critical acclaim and box office totals.<p>1) <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simpson%27s_paradox"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simpson%27s_paradox</a>",1452472641

10877986,comment,10877500,10877500,0,0,makebelieve,,,"Searle is making an argument about awareness.  That a computer system is explicitly unaware of any of it&#x27;s content.  That it&#x27;s programs are functions and the data also performs a purely functional role.  In essence, computers cannot engage in acts of meaning.  The programmers and users are engaged in acts of meaning.<p>For instance, saying a program &quot;has a bug&quot;, is a completely misleading statement.  No programs have bugs.  It is impossible for a program to have a bug, just as it is impossible for a physical process to &quot;do something wrong&quot;.  Programs do what they do, just as molecular processes do what they do.  The concept of error and meaning does not exist in a program, just as it does not exist in the physical universe.  Meaning (and errors and bugs are a kind of meaning) are things outside programs and outside physics.  When a program &quot;has a bug&quot; it means the programmer screwed up, not the program.  A program cannot produce errors, because programs, and computer systems in general, do not have the capacity to have meaning.  This is what Searle is demonstrating with his argument.<p>This is true for all the popular computational approaches we have today. However, because the human brain appears to function in a purely physical way, and computers function in a purely physical way, it should be theoretically possible to create a computer system that is conscious and aware of meaning just as we are.  You refer to this as &quot;Strong AI&quot;.  Other refer to it as Artificial General Intelligence. I refer to this as machine consciousness.   To solve the machine consciousness problem means understanding how awareness, meaning, and representation in general, works. Then building a computer system that engages in representation and instantiates awareness.<p>If an actual person were put into Searle&#x27;s box, the person would learn chinese.  Also, the person could &#x27;intentionally&#x27; produce incorrect answers annoying the &quot;programmers&quot; who set the box up in the first place.  But a modern computer system cannot &#x27;intentionally&#x27; produce errors.  it&#x27;s completely non-sensical to talk about computers as having intention at all. programmers have intention, not computers.<p>Solving the intentionality problem is the other leg of machine consciousness. Elon Musk, Steven Hawking, Nick Bostrom and others make arguments about the dangers of an AI (of any variety) which may acquire intentionality and representational ability, while ignoring the actual deep problems embedded in acquiring those abilities.<p>Awareness, representation, and intention are so fundamental to experience that we have a very difficult time understanding when they happen and when they do not. We see a representational world all around us, but very explicitly, there are no representations at all in the physical world.<p>I believe machine consciousness is possible, but none of the existing approaches will get us there. Searle&#x27;s chinese room is one succinct argument as to why.<p>The approach I am taking is a kind of metabolic computing. Where single function processes interact in some way similar to molecular interactions and those processes are developed to produce, computational structures like membranes and DNA and eventually &quot;cells&quot;.  These cells then form multi-cellular structures. These multi-cellular structures and underlying &quot;molecular&quot; interactions instantiate representations and representational processes, like a nervous system.  A computational nervous system which embodies representation, intention, sensation, action, imagination, and because it engages in representation making, would be aware.<p>I would love to hear someone describe how any kind of  computational approach can produce meaning inside a computer system. We produce meaning and representations so easily; it&#x27;s hard to understand the difference of perspective necessary to see how representations must form. If someone has an easier approach than the one I am taking, I would be very interested in seeing how they solve the problems of meaning and intention with code.",1452472212

In the worst case (e.g. the FDIV bug on the Pentium) you have to recall the CPU. Obviously, this is very bad. That&#x27;s why modern CPUs have what are called &quot;chicken bits&quot; or &quot;kill bits&quot;, which the BIOS or OS can set to disable specific features. The most recent use of kill bits I can recall is Intel disabling the TSX instructions on the Haswell line of CPUs. Finally, the least invasive option is to issue a microcode update, alters the way that x86 instructions get decoded to avoid the problematic behavior. Microcode updates are issued as software patches, and they&#x27;re actually in the Linux kernel source tree.<p>If you want to learn more about all three of these fix techniques, in addition to learning a bit about the steps that Intel and AMD take to prevent such bugs in the first place, I highly recommend this CCC talk: <a href=""https://media.ccc.de/v/32c3-7171-when_hardware_must_just_work"" rel=""nofollow"">https://media.ccc.de/v/32c3-7171-when_hardware_must_just_wor...</a>.",1452471855

The opposite is true for other specialists, like surgeons.<p>The rest of the article focused on peoples&#x27; emotional reactions, but that paragraph is key. Medicare, Medicaid, and the insurance companies will pay more than enough for tests and surgeries, but not for the diagnoses and treatments that hospitalists and GP&#x27;s perform themselves. So the folks running the hospital budgets are naturally trying to change the model so that the hospitalists quickly refer patients to the more profitable departments.<p>The only actor able to change this model is the US Congress, which makes the legislation that sets the Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement rates.

Rent control laws are strict in San Francisco, but people who lose their rent controlled apartment after decades are pretty much hosed.

Many renters feel they never had the means to get into the housing market, not then, not now, so this gamble wasn&#x27;t really a choice.

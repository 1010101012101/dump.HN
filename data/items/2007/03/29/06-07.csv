At the first Startup School (Cambridge), Paul's speech casually mentioned that grad school was a good way to meet co-founders.  I wasn't specifically looking for co-founders (although like he predicted, I found some here) but decided that it was the right time to get a master's.  In the next nine months, I quit my job, moved to Silicon Valley and started full-time grad school in CS.  So far it's been one of the best decisions of my life.  Thanks, Paul!",1175151227

7211,comment,6668,6668,0,0,joeljordan,,,"The cofounder requirement is always going to be a huge deal for a lot of people.  I spent lots of time in college doing extracurricular projects to try to find smart, hard-working people to be around.  Most of the best of that bunch ended up working for large technology companies for lack of any better ideas.  My experience suggests that meeting cofounders at school is a pretty chancy thing.\nI wonder if the best way to purposely meet potential cofounders isn't to work at startups in the first place, where people won't be stuck in the big-company mindset.

7210,comment,6668,6668,0,0,blats,,,"""Even the founders who fail don't seem to have such a bad time.""<p>I was a founder in a startup that died late last year. It was the hardest I have ever worked, and one of the most challenging things I have ever done. It was frustrating in so many ways and there was amazing amounts of strife involved. In the end the project ran out of money and the products of my labor and imagination are now gathering dust in storage. After all that, without any monetary reward, I would do it all again in a second. The challenge of following my senses through completely unknown territory and the reward of seeing my idea come to life was more then enough to make the whole thing worth it. It was the challenge that drove me. In the end it was the challenge itself that rewarded me even though the company didn't fly.<p>\n""A lot of people think they're too young to start a startup. Many are right. The median age worldwide is about 27...""<p>I do agree completely with the idea that adulthood is a state of mind and not an age. I remember my dad asking me ""What do you want?"" when i was somewhere between 18 and 21. My reply at that time was ""I just want to be comfortable."" I remember it quite distinctly. He then told me ""I expect that will change some day, given your creed."" He was right,  and I realized it while in the midst of working my tail off on a project. All I wanted to do was work on my ideas, see them come to life. The discomfort didn't slow me down at all, it was the challenge that I wanted.<p>\n""You need a lot of determination to succeed as a startup founder. It's probably the single best predictor of success.""<p>A founder without determination is not going to succeed, but their drive can't cause them to loose perspective. One can dig with a singular purpose and make a big hole, but if it is in the wrong place it does the project no good.<p>\n""You don't need to know anything about business to start a startup.""<p>True, but eventually the business skills will be required if the project is to continue. My experiences have taught me that while a viable product is most of the battle, a lack of resources on the business end of a project can stop it in it's tracks. Weather it is the founders themselfs that learn the skills, or outside resources are brought in to help - the skills must be obtained. The lesson I learned is pick the right people to depend on, or depend on yourself. Implementing your ideas is great all in itself, but it is much better if there is someone interesting there to see it when you finish.<p>""If you don't have a co founder, what should you do? Get one.""<p>Be careful! Going into business with someone in the startup environment is a commitment. You will spend allot of time with them and you will have to depend on them constantly. It is almost like a marriage, choose wisely. Good friends do not always make good business partners.<p>\n""In a sense, it's not a problem if you don't have a good idea...""<p>I believe that a person's ability to learn, gain skills, and adapt is the most important thing period. You find someone with a carrot, you've just got a carrot. Even if you need a carrot, their value is limited once they give it to you. Find a gardener and you can grow anything you need. Reminds me of some proverb about choosing a fishing pole or a fish.<p>\n""This one is real. I wouldn't advise anyone with a family to start a startup.""<p>I agree with this 100%. I did it, and I would not advise it for someone with a choice. My family is amazing and supportive and more then anything else they KNOW me. I have founder pumping through my veins. The startup world is home to me, there is no question that I will be a serial entrepreneur. Good ideas give me goosebumps, unsolved problems give me insomnia. My family supports who I am, so I am able to do what makes me happy. Successfully pouring your soul into a project and being a member of a family at the same time is a learned skill. Play it safe unless you know what you are getting into, or just can't change who you are.<p>\n""Start another company? Are you crazy?""<p>See above.<p>\n""Be aware, though, that if you get a regular job, you'll probably end up working there for as long as a startup would take, and you'll find you have much less spare time than you might expect.""<p>Working a regular job instead of chasing dreams is still a commitment. Yes, you can work a regular job without thinking about it all the time. You can go to work 8 hours a day 5 days a week and not have it take over the rest of your personal time. Having said that, is it really worth it? Why do something all day that you don't care about? Sounds flawed to me.<p>\n""Each person should just do what they need to without anyone telling them.""<p>This throws back to the ""pick carefully"" comment. Your choice in business partners is paramount. There are many many people who will just stand there on the field with the ball looking confused. Within the constraints of a startup you may not have time to figure it out after the fact. Make sure you know they can work, and that they can work with you.<p>\n""If you go to work for Microsoft, you can predict fairly accurately what the next few years will be likeÃÂall too accurately, in fact. If you start a startup, anything might happen.""<p>This is part of what attracts me to the role of a founder. Clicking send on an important proposal and not knowing what will happen is like jumping off a bridge for me (with cord of course). I love not knowing, I love the process of finding out. I love the risks you have to take and the rewards you can reap. Anything can happen, and that resonates with me.<p>\n""A significant number of would-be startup founders are probably dissuaded from doing it by their parents.""<p>This is a problem I never had. My dad tells a story about having a booth across the aisle from Oracle WAY back when they were both small. He was lead developer on a similar DB app called RDM which was a far more mature and fully featured product at the time. His business leaders thought conservatively, Oracle shot for the stars. The rest is history. My father will never discourage me from chasing my ideas, and my mom just loves to see me glow. He was there, at the time and the place; he chose the steady paycheck.<p>\n""Imagine being sad on Sunday afternoons because the weekend was almost over, and tomorrow you'd have to get up and go to work. How did they stand it?""<p>What, as apposed to kicking back - stretching out - and wondering what day it is on Sunday afternoon? Never.. operating by the seat of your pants and living your ideas is the only way to go. Its the best feeling in the world, and the bad times only make the good ones better.<p>[edit] Getting my proverbs straight.",1175149673

7207,comment,7136,7156,0,0,whacked_new,,,"I doubt the question answering will be just for points. Eventually they can build up a profile of you and perhaps secretly change the weighting of points, or change the kinds of ""goods"" you get to see. That would create a pretty interesting quickdating service. What I find most intriguing is the point system. Joining = 100 questions answered; it looks like a rather arbitrary number. <p>If it takes 6 seconds to answer a question that's 10 minutes per 500 points (""ideal"" case). Looks like the baseline will be high enough that new users need to spend significant time answering questions to make useful bids. Looks like a great platform for a popularity war, i.e. MySpace crowd and not Facebook crowd.",1175149013

7205,comment,7136,7156,0,0,noisemaker,,,"Either you didn't read the article carefully or have not used the site. There is a lot of communication tools built into the site. The main point of the for the point system is to put a barrier to entry in establishing relationships. On most dating or Social network sites, people can easily cast a wide net of people they want to get in touch with. But with IILWY, the points make it too costly to do the same approach. In other words, your relationships are more special. Once a game is finished, the person who put on the game and the chosen player establish a connection like in other social networking sites. They can message each other, or even have it call the other user's cell phone (safely without revealing each others phone numbers). And there is much more coming.",1175148980
7204,comment,7136,7158,0,0,AurSaraf,,,"Good day.<p>No. Do you?<p>I don't think that a club only made up of ""hot people"" is any less of a meat market, especially since females tend to pay very little attention to physical attractiveness compared to other qualities (men DO tend to judge a lot by physical attraction, sadly, though I'm an exception).<p>So what will we have? A group of hot women pursued by a group of blatant men feeling really good about themselves since they managed to ""get in"", but probably are only slightly better in average than the average guy at pleasing women. Of course there will be successes, even a bit more, relatively, than in a normal dating site, but the mechanism will be 100% the same, so there's no REAL filtering done. The social game will be the same one. Nothing REAL gained (except for the good feeling of superiority from rejecting people, yuck).<p>Tell me, how do you meet women? Do, and I'll give you a better idea for a dating site.<p>Aur Saraf",1175148943

Unfortunately, most patients are not sufficiently informed about medicine to make a rational market choice. (Indeed, outside my specialty, I am not really either, and would seek the advice of a trusted physician friend, which is a luxury most don&#x27;t have.)<p>For example, the PA and expert system would not reliably know when they are in over their heads and require an MD. Some subset of people would suffer serious injury or death through no fault of their own other than not having had the information necessary to allocate their funds in a manner most benefiting their interests.",1397606338

These are all analogies with our own intentional processes.<p>&quot;Figuring out&quot; the brain even as if it was a human-created artifact seems immensely hard.

What happens to the city&#x27;s economy when everyone&#x27;s commute is doubled because housing in the city is becoming prohibitively expensive as supply shrinks? Without zoning laws, how do you attract people to move to your city when there&#x27;s no guarantee their apartment building will still be an apartment building once the lease is up?<p>To answer the question, I think it&#x27;s the city government&#x27;s job to balance the interests of people and businesses that reside in the city. In a perfect world, every side effect and externality would be neatly quantifiable, and municipal leadership would be fair and evenhanded.

What this seems to imply is that if a new Greenwald or Snowden comes along, they are explicitly not welcome. This is not affirmative action at all, it&#x27;s just an unreflected usage of it, without understanding the true meaning or function of affirmative action.<p>Go back and read the question. You&#x27;re perpetuating a narrative that takes his words out of context. The question was asked if there was anything they were specifically looking for. He said yes, people who are not white males. They are already mostly white males and they want to write something that is less from the perspective of mostly white males.<p>That is affirmative action. You have the definition correct.<p>Also, what are you trying to do by name dropping Simone de Beauvoir? It doesn&#x27;t earn you any credibility. It does sound though like you think of yourself as a feminist or at least a supporter of equality if you won&#x27;t use that label, since you&#x27;re also creating strawmen feminists (who the hell says most books are not worth reading because they&#x27;re written by men? Please tell me about which feminist scholar or author wrote about that).

7595067,comment,7594474,7594884,4,0,SapphireSun,,,"That&#x27;s a popular theory, but it doesn&#x27;t help much because a) we want universal access (poor people just won&#x27;t use it if they have to pay) b) non-professionals don&#x27;t review metrics critically and don&#x27;t have enough knowledge to (and the metrics are hard to interpret for experts) and c) laymen just don&#x27;t have enough knowledge to make good decisions with their money, they&#x27;ll just use price as a signal of quality regardless of the underlying quality.<p>For some ordinary, understandable things, we can get people to pay if they have the means and understanding to do so, but we need to pay for outcomes (indexed for the base sickness of the population) for more complex cases. However, paying for outcomes forces the financial risk onto the doctor, so what we really need is some mixture of &quot;pay for performance&quot; and &quot;fee for service&quot; to keep them in business, but focused on adapting their practices to evidence and modernity over the decades.<p>One way to reduce bureaucracy and paper work is simply &quot;Medicare for everyone&quot; which reduces the number of forms, data links, and creates a massive negotiating position for the payer which is needed in an inelastic market such as medicine.<p>To give an example, if the patients are directly on the hook and grandpa is sick, they&#x27;ll just send him to the &quot;highest quality hospital&quot; as determined by a mixture of patient reviews (&quot;The rooms were well lit and people smiled!&quot;) and price (&quot;This is the most expensive and therefore best hospital in the area!&quot;). It might even have the best metrics (the sickest and (correlated) poorest will go to the cheaper hospital and tank their metrics). They&#x27;ll then pay basically anything to keep grandpa alive regardless of what the hospital asks, maybe raising money if they need to.<p>Hence, inelastic complex market without where transparency can actually hurt.<p>The other thing to note is that if people of means pay $100 cash to obtain better healthcare and jump the line, it&#x27;s kind of like paying more to get gas during hurricane Sandy. You&#x27;re not creating more or better resources for the people, but merely rearranging them at high cost to the benefit of the affluent.

7595035,comment,7594393,7594393,18,0,bdcs,,,"Previously, processors and merchants accepting bitcoin payments would wait until a large fraction of bitcoin nodes listed a 0-conf txn as &quot;valid-but-unconfirmed,&quot; the so-called memory pool or mempool (because it is a collection of transactions in RAM). This works well, because we empirically know how nodes operate: they accept these valid-but-unconfirmed txns into the blockchain and reject (both discard and fail to relay) any competing txns (&quot;doublespends&quot;). Doublespend attacks worked by filling the global mempool with the doublespends before the original txn fills the mempool. Naïve software wouldn&#x27;t check the global mempool. So really, there were two types of 0-confs: txns which were agreed upon by >90% of the global mempool and those which it was unknown (but sometimes assumed).<p>Now, BitUndo changes how people perceive mining nodes! No longer is the mempool immutable, but rather mutable for a price. This price, as it stands, is 10% per successful undo and 0% per failure. So if BitUndo (and federated pools) controls 1% of the network, then 99% of 0-confs will confirm, 1% will be undone, and 0.1% of the total transferred will be paid in fees to BitUndo. It throws more of a wrench into the system as the BitUndo federation varies from 0% to 100%. Empirically, it will be trivial to see what percentage of the network is engaged in BitUndos. If that percentage becomes materially large, then it will have a material effect on how the system treats 0-confs, for better or worse.<p>Interesting, this service is definitely available privately (or should be assumed to be).

I don&#x27;t mean to diminish PG or his always-valuable advise. I am merely pointing out that a lot of these points are far more applicable to a certain class of entrepreneur.<p>If you take a single 18 to 25 year old &quot;kids&quot; with no business experience whatsoever and a life experience mostly devoid of struggle I&#x27;d be the probability of failure is absolutely huge.  Entrepreneurship can test you in incredible ways.  It can take you to the deepest and darkest moments of your life.  And, if you are alone and are not &quot;built&quot; for it you will crumble.<p>Anyone with a good amount of business experience has a far greater probability of success if only because they&#x27;ve done it before and understand the game.  You can hire people for the other functions that need to be performed.<p>I guess my point is that a co-founder is not some kind of a magic pill that will auto-magically make things better.  Teaming up with someone with limited or no business experience and you hardly know is a formula for disaster.  If both of you are newbies and you have some external coaching (YC) then, yes, things could be better.<p>I had a situation with someone who wanted to partner-up for a mobile app.  I flat-out refused to partner (in the sense of company co-ownership).  We put together a revenue-sharing agreement (50-50 was fine for this case).  Control and all business decisions remained with me.  I would eventually learn this was a great decision when this person went off the rails half-way through development.<p>It sounds like you have solid business experience.  Don&#x27;t buy into the SCV mantra of having to have a co-founder.  Do it your way.  Now, if you have to play on their turf then it&#x27;s their rules.  Outside that, there&#x27;s no reason you couldn&#x27;t be successful.  Not one.<p>BTW, I don&#x27;t buy YC/SCV statistics because they do not include the millions of solo-founder businesses that are launched every year.  There&#x27;s everything from lunch truck operators to restaurants, web design shops and tech companies.  I am going to go out on a limb and say that if you looked at that data you might see that solo founders have a far greater probability of success than the SCV crowd mantra paints.<p>Again, if you are taking business virgins out of college to start businesses, yes, absolutely, get two, four or six of them because they are very likely to commit business seppuku if on their own.  Also, VC&#x27;s need insurance if they are going to make an investment.

A friend of mine worked as a QA engineer at my city&#x27;s most prominent children&#x27;s hospital (a minor power on the world stage). His thankless task was to find ways to improve communications between departments and curb the errors. It was simply not possible - every doctor had their preferred provider, sometimes from merit, sometimes because they liked the shiny goodies that the sales reps brought.<p>All the individual systems interoperated very poorly, and none of the physicians would budge, and the hospital administration could not force their hand. Any time admin tried to regularise something, the affected physician would just state &quot;If we make this change, <i>children will die</i>&quot;. It didn&#x27;t matter that everyone at the table new that this was a total lie, because the official authority for that department (or speciality) was that specialist. They got their &#x27;free market&#x27;, being able to use their preferred products for each individual specialist, for personal preference at the cost of better overall treatment. The whole was very much less the sum of its parts.<p>Another friend became a sales rep for a pharma company. The rep she took over from was a fairly standard rep, but she was quite ethical, and would only allow her &#x27;freebie&#x27; budget to be used on things that developed the practise. Some doctors already do this. Others were more like &quot;ah, well, the ride is over with this rep&quot;. Some were absolutely outraged that she should dictate to them what this &#x27;extra income&#x27; was spent on - how dare she suggest medical charts instead of football tickets?<p>I myself have personally seen a specialist in a field report on some clinical studies so badly that we technicians had to go to other specialists and get them redone. That specialist didn&#x27;t get any more of that kind of work at our practise, but his utter incompetence was never followed up beyond &quot;don&#x27;t hire him again&quot;.<p>I guess the moral of the stories are that freedom to run practises as you see fit does not mean ethical (or even ethically neutral) behaviour, and that an environment where every physician uses their preferred products does not mean better care is delivered.",1397604690

I refuse to believe that professional landlords are keeping units off the market when the current rental market may well represent the top of what they can get for the next 5 years.  Most of the long term landlords who bought 20-30 years ago have gone through at least 3 down markets from the late 80s to now.  The current employment gold rush in SF is just that, and I suspect long term owners recognize that and want to strike while the iron is hot.<p>I am willing to change my opinion if anyone could provide any tangible data, but I only see this argument bandied about with no actual proof.<p>So in my rebuttal, I would say that I guess that there are less than 100 units like that across the city.

The truth is it means something different to every person. For years I have defined Devops as Engineers trying get Ops out of the way and pushing forward with out those pesky sys admins. Your think I am over blowing it? I have been in the Silicon Valley for the boom of Devops and I hear it all the time “We dont need ops, we can just have a developer do it”. The number of new startups who use AWS thus allowing them to forgo a system administrator never ceases to amaze me. My biggest problem with this is your cutting the legs out from yourself, but your assuring me job security so maybe I should keep my mouth shut.\nI have been a a operations engineer for over ten years now, and honestly developers and ops engineers have different ways of functioning. To me a good software engineer has long term focus, can get deep into a project and crunch on the same code for extended durations. Give a good coder a project that will take weeks or even months and they will put there head down and solve your problem. As a generalization these people do not handle interrupt driven work well, they also often do not handle high pressure situations well.\nOperations people on the other hand do the majority of their work under massive interruption and constant pressure. Tell a operations engineer the site is down and they will not focus on what the origin of the problem is, they will focus on getting the product back online and come back to fully understand why. This does not mean they do not troubleshoot but they are trying to identify the immediate cause not the who or root. One might argue this is short sited but when your stuck waiting for someone to figure out why the web severs where started your killing your customer experience. I would argue restart the web pool get the product back online and then start to look at root cause once you have identified the customer impact problem and completed the shortest path solution.\nWhen you start off by having your engineers run operations you never allow new ops people to start from ground up and develop their skills, learning the pain points as the system grows thus ensuring when you grow to the point that you need a operations engineer the is a shortage of trained people available. One might argue that some of the developers that started the company by running operations will become your operations engineers and will cover this but to me thats like using a vice grips to remove a bolt.",1397604599

If we wanted to be wealthy, with the grades and letters required to get into med school in the US, most of us could readily have chosen other professions. (Heck, some even walk away from startups, believe it or not).\nMy impression as someone in practice for more than a decade, who cares for a large number of docs, and has run a large clinic: It&#x27;s really not the reimbursement. It&#x27;s the combination of dealing with payers determined to deny treatment, massive requirements in terms of documentation and ongoing accreditation, and - in particular - constant pressure to spend less time with more patients. Then, we read posts like these which buy into conspiracy theories about how we&#x27;re out to poison patients with expensive medications to line our pockets. The time problem in particular afflicts primary care docs the most, but even the surgeons complain about it.\nAs far as ACA and its impact, there&#x27;s no question it&#x27;s a hack (and not a good one) - most economists not on the far right agree single payer would be optimal - but under the political circumstances, it was probably the best we could get.\nRegardless, we&#x27;ll move to a system where the majority of care isn&#x27;t delivered by docs.

To the extent HBO moves into direct-subscription or advertising-driven models, it&#x27;ll need to find a way to do those in addition to its existing, cable-licensing business -- not as an alternative.<p>The problem is that HBO makes a lot more money licensing to cable providers than it realistically could by selling episodes a la carte, by selling advertising, or by selling HBO subscriptions individually. Any president or C-level exec at HBO (regardless of its corporate parent) is going to have a hell of a time initiating that process, politically, organizationally, or economically. It would basically amount to telling shareholders, stakeholders, and peers that one is going to jeopardize X to pursue a very uncertain X/4.<p>HBO will go a la carte, or ad-driven, if and when it can figure out how to make the economics of doing so more attractive than the economics of B2B licensing fees. That&#x27;s easier said than done. It will probably require one of two things: 1) a platform-agnostic licensing strategy, i.e., to diversify away from cable; or 2) a complete rethinking of content forms, types, and salability.<p>It bears mentioning that even ad-driven broadcast networks make more money off of cable licensing than they do from advertising. (The revenue split is about 48% advertising and 52% cable/distribution fees, trending toward 40/60.)<p>As for the article&#x27;s fundamental mistake--conflating Time Warner with Time Warner Cable--that&#x27;s a pretty big one.

While it&#x27;s not biased, I hope it never gives a 50/50 split. There are many reasons why 50/50 is bad.<p>The obvious one is that it kills decision-making. One day, the two co-founders will disagree, but since no one can overrule the other one, the company will drift and possibly die.<p>But there is a much more interesting problem (that they don&#x27;t teach you in you MBA class): founders going for 50/50 is a sign that the company doesn&#x27;t have a real leader. Rather than have a very unpleasant conversation about why you, the alpha CEO, should be the ultimate boss, no one feels comfortable having that discussion. You sit one evening around the table discussing how to incorporate, you sort of shyly say &quot;what about 50/50&quot;, your co-founder stares at the floor and nods. Done. You have a 50/50 split, and a huge red warning sign of future company failure.<p>Source: I wrote the calculator below and had detailed discussions with 100+ founders about how to split their equity with their co-founders.",1397603199

I read the page, and I understand that now you&#x27;re doing two-day instead of seven-day transfers.<p>What I&#x27;m wondering is, &quot;how is this possible?&quot; How is Stripe now moving the money faster than before? What change made this possible? Did the stewards of the ACH system make a change that allows this? Is Stripe advancing funds ahead of time based on some kind of credit? Was the seven-day policy basically arbitrary before, and so changing it to two-day basically involves changing an integer somewhere in the codebase and updating documentation? Or is it something else happening at a different layer? More generally, what are the pieces at play in transferring money that influence transfer time? And which of these pieces has Stripe interacted with in order to transfer funds faster?",1397603073
7594871,comment,7594474,7594822,5,0,selmnoo,,,"> To pay this off in 10 years, the monthly payment would be on the order of $3400.<p>Once employed, hospitals agree on some arrangement in which they help pay sometimes up to as much as 50% of their loans (HRSA alone pays $170k in loan repayment to primary care docs for 5 years of service in a shortage area). And I don&#x27;t know what kind of doctors you guys have been hanging out with, but most make way more than $300k after only a handful of years of experience.<p>> It&#x27;s not unheard of for some medical students to have loan debt exceeding $300k.<p>True, but as it turns out, most doctors are sons and daughters of rich folks (at least that&#x27;s what sister tells me, who&#x27;s doing her residency now). So those loan debt episodes are being paid by mommies and daddies, and it&#x27;s rather rare for these doctors to ever feel the pangs of financial pain in their time.",1397603038

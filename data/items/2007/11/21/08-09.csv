82392,comment,82019,82019,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"I'm seeing less memory usage, so far (I upgraded this afternoon, and have been running for about 8 hours).  It also doesn't crash every fifteen minutes the way Gran Paradiso did when I tried it.  Firebug 1.1 works, so I'm golden.  Got no bookmarks (delicious isn't available yet, I guess), but that won't kill me: I only go to three sites anyway (Google, Reddit, News.YC) and I know those addresses.",1195633703
82391,comment,82321,82321,0,0,shunted,,,"Consider the set of polynomials {z^n} where n ranges from 0 to infinity using even integers.  All the zeros of the polynomials in the set are zero and so stable.  Consider the power series expansion of .5 Cos(z).  It is a weighted sum of the polynomials of our set and the zeros of .5 Cos(z) are clearly not bounded.  I use .5 Cos(z) so that the coefficient of each term of the power series expansion is a value that satisfies 0 < a < 1. \n",1195633564

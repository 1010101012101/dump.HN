Most people take their health for granted, something you wont do after this story.<p>January 27, 2012. A rash started to present itself all over her body, not a bothersome one. The rash appeared to be like tiny purple freckles, something the patient referred to as Dalmatian spots. She had other symptoms as well feeling lightheaded every time she stood, bleeding gums, and a very pale look. Unbeknownst to her all these symptoms were related. A doctors appointment had been made. Her doctor unsure of what the rash was, ordered a blood test.<p>January 28, 2012. Five in the morning, the telephone rings, her doctor is on the other line their is a sound of urgency in his voice. The results from the blood test are back, her platelet levels are extremely low. A foreign term to her and her family. The doctor had ordered for her to go immediately to an emergency room. He suspects some sort of blood transfusion will be necessary.<p>January 28, 2012. Three o'clock in the afternoon, she is already registered as a patient in the hospital. The low levels of platelets is so dangerous that internal bleeding is a very imminent possibility as well as bleeding in the brain. The young woman and family unaware of how big of a problem this was.<p>Just in time, the doctor walks in to explain what platelets are.<p>The functions of platelets are related to the clotting of blood. Because of their adhesion and aggregation capabilities platelets can occlude small breaks in blood vessels and prevent the escape of blood.<p>In simple terms they are what help clot the blood.<p> An average number is between 200,000 - 250,000, this particular patient has 2,000 platelets.<p>Obviously very low and very dangerous. Its explained that a blood transfusion will not be necessary, only a transfusion of platelets. Half an hour later, one Benadryl (to avoid an allergic reaction), one Zantac (to avoid ulcers), and one IV later the transfusion is done.<p>January 28, 2012. Later that night another blood test is ordered, to see how much the transfusion helped. The results, 5,000 platelets. Nothing more can be done today. The young woman and family optimistic that this problem will soon be resolved. Optimism something that goes against the nature of the patient. Little do they know that what they experienced today will be their lives for the next month and a half.<p>February 11, 2012. Exactly two weeks after the patient was admitted to the hospital, she is being discharged. Two very long, very painful and very stressful weeks. No progress has been made on trying to combat this disease, this ITP. During those two weeks, a bone marrow biopsy was done. A bone marrow biopsy that includes cutting a hole in the hip bone, and getting to center of the bone and extracting a sample of the sponge like tissue. A painful procedure that had to be done to evaluate the production of blood cells, more specifically platelets. A couple of hours later the doctor had the results, her bone marrow which is what produces platelets and other blood components. The bone marrow was so suppressed from the medicine she had been religiously taking for the past 18 months, that her body has stopped producing platelets altogether. Backtrack, the medicine she had been taking, was to kill the brain tumor she has lived with all of her life. This medicine, this form of chemotherapy has these type of side effects, but the patient was unaware of such drastic repercussions. The patient was trying to fix one problem when another arises. Prognosis, The bone marrow will start to heal itself once the chemo is completely gone from her body.<p>That should happen in about 14 days, no special precautions are needed thats all the hematologist has to say. The patient has no reason to doubt him, he is one of the best doctors in the hospital the patient was told.<p>February 12, 2012. Home sweet home, or so she thought. She still was experiencing the same symptoms as before, lightheaded ness, bleeding gums, and exhaustion.<p>February 13, 2012. Bright an early, her primary care doctor calls again. The patient is told that she already has an appointment to see another hematologist. According to him this problem is not just going to go away without some sort of intervention. Another blood test is ordered, the patient is used to being pricked more than once a day. Bad results, 3,000 platelets another transfusion is ordered. This process has become the patients daily routine, and it will be her routine for the next month.<p>31 days later, 3 different medicines, a permanent IV, and an allergic reaction later, surgery to remove her spleen is ordered. Her spleen because thats where the platelets are being massacred, a word the patient used. The patient was being put thru hell and back, you could see that life wasnt present in her body anymore, she was going thru the motions of this disease. She was going thru the motions arm and arm with her mother, although it seems that this disease had hurt her more. The patient felt like she was nearing the end of the road. She had little faith that this surgery would work.<p>March 20, 2012. A sleepless night, she has been waiting for two blood transfusions. As of five oclock in the morning they hadnt arrived. The transfusions were to be given to reduce the risk of excessive bleeding during the surgery. The time has come, she says good-bye to her parents and brother. The emotions are overwhelming that the four of them crying out of fear because of the risky surgery. She enters the operating room, a bright room, everything is white. The patient says to herself that the room looks nothing like the medical television show House. She is put on the operating table, the anesthesia is starting to take effect. She feels as if her body is sinking into the table, as if she were becoming one with the table.<p>March 20, 2012. Three oclock in the afternoon, she slowly starts to open her eyes. She is in an Intensive Care Unit room, where she will spend the next three days. The first image she sees is the image of her younger cousin staring at with fear and sorrow. She is connected to many machines, that all she hears is beeping and buzzing. The patient has a tube going down her nose into her stomach to suction all the remaining blood, a very painful process. She is hooked up to an IV narcotic machine to minimize the pain. Being the fighter she is, the nurses would have to give her the medicine because she did not like taking it. Once left alone with her brother, her parents left to go to the cafeteria. She tells her brother with tears in her eyes and her voice shaking, that she is sorry for not being strong enough. Her brother trying to ease her pain, tells her that she is the strongest and bravest person he knows. Or something to that extent, the medicine was putting her back to sleep. Although the pain would wake her up soon enough.<p>The moment had come time to hear the results of the blood tests post surgery. Two hundred and fourteen thousand platelets, normal. A sigh of relief, the family is very pleased to hear those types of results. The excitement was short lived because for the next three days those levels would continue to drop.<p>March 25, 2012. Discharge day, a great day. The patient is discharged but with no pain killers, although she is still in pain. She is a firm believer in that what doesnt kill you will make you stronger. The four of them would finally get to go home and sleep. She has told the rest of her family that she would like the day off, no visitors, she would like to rest. They have some trepidation about what the next few days will bring.<p>March 26, 2012. First doctors visit since the surgery. The routine is slowly coming back, blood test, results 17,000 platelets. Something new, instead of a transfusion a medicine is going to be given, a medicine they had already tried. The medicine is given to start and activate the bone marrow into producing platelets. Fast forward to another week of the same thing.<p>April 7, 2012. A Saturday, there is only one nurse in charge on the weekends. Again the routine, blood test and wait for the results. Although nobody was expecting the results to be so good, 50,000 platelets. Not normal yet but the fact that her body was no longer killing the platelets and starting to produce them, was a great achievement. The news was so overwhelming that the nurse and her mother were tearing up. A milestone had been reached. Now keep in mind this did not mean the problem was solved. This just meant that the combination of medicine and removing the spleen was working. The patient would not reach remission until August, a couple months later. This was a step in the right direction after so many steps backwards.<p>The journey wasnt over though, she now had to start and live a normal life. The patient had no idea what that meant because for the couple of years she had solely focused on trying to get healthy. She had been trying to reach remission for the brain tumor as well. That in it of it self was a big problem because since the tumor was active, she was struck with symptoms of a stroke. Some of them were weakness on side of her body, balance and coordination problems. Which meant she could no longer walk on her own or do anything on her own. That slowly was getting better as well. The patient was still left with pieces of the puzzle she didnt know how to put back together in her life.",1368241126

5689561,comment,5688803,5689356,7,0,evincarofautumn,,,"> 'why do I need it?'<p>For the same reasons you need any programming languageto write useful software in!<p>> Currently I am learning Javaand Ruby<p>These are both good ideas. Java is widely used, reliable, and well tested for developing large applications. Ruby is simply a lot of fun to use, and one of the things youll discover while using Ruby is that it places a lot of functional programming idioms in an object-oriented context.<p>The issue with many popular languages is that they fall into much the same paradigm, namely imperative and either procedural or object-oriented, with some functional features borrowed for working with lists. Its worthwhile to see that not all languages are like this, and learning a new language is not just about new syntax and APIs.<p>> but what about Haskell? I am genuinely curious what Haskell can offer.<p>Haskell will teach you to think about structuring your program in terms of simple data and transformations on that data. Object-oriented programming is about <i>coupling</i> data with behaviour, whereas a big part of learning Haskell is learning how to recognise high-level patterns in data structures and functions separately. In doing so, you can avoid the work of reimplementing common operations yourself.<p>You begin to say, oh, this is a data structure I can map a function over; Id better make it an instance of Functor. And hey, I could use this data structure to represent this kind of computation, maybe it should be an Applicative and a Monad so I get some nice syntax for dealing with it. This function has a type signature that looks an awful lot like that other type signatureI wonder if I could implement one in terms of the other? And so on.<p>The type system and succinct syntax also make it very easy to create new data types, and you learn how this can help avoid bugsdont use a Boolean here, use an enumeration with two values; then you cant mess up. Java discourages this by requiring more syntactic effort to create a new datatype.<p>A useful and oft-cited example of this is in the context of web frameworks: if you have separate data types for strings and HTML, that one simple thing eliminates a whole class of injection attacks. If you represent your links in the type system, then you can statically ensure that your site does not have any broken links. Simply put, quite a lot of bad things can be caught at compile time if you have a type system expressive enough to talk about them.<p>> I have yet to come across any notable project written with it.<p>There are more notable projects out there, but heres my self-promotion. At my old job[1] I maintained a compiler for ActionScript 3 in Haskell, as well as a build system that coordinated the compiler and other build tools to convert Flash games to iOS and Android applications.<p>Haskell is excellent at manipulating data structuresif that sounds ridiculously general, thats because it is. The compiler is very nearly feature complete and, even with a certain amount of technical debt, was an order of magnitude smaller and easier to refactor than it would have been in an imperative language.<p>So there you go. From a recovering professional Haskeller, why you should learn Haskell. And, for that matter, the answer to should I learn this language? is always yes; but some languages should be higher on your list than others. ;)<p>[1]: <a href=""http://spaceport.io/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://spaceport.io/</a>",1368240987

The cost is just attached to the price of their products without the consumer knowing.<p>Also if you are running a H.264 subscription service you are likely to be paying [tens of thousands to hundreds of thousands](<a href=""http://www.zdnet.com/blog/bott/h-264-patents-how-much-do-they-really-cost/2122"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.zdnet.com/blog/bott/h-264-patents-how-much-do-the...</a>).<p>Also there is Android, Chrome and ChromeOS which should have support.<p>Not everyone wants to pay a tax or go though a licensing procedure to implement some supposedly 'open' standard.<p>The main issue is Free software doesn't work with licensing. Linux distros are free (as in money), they can't have proprietary licensed patents. So you can't legally playback videos on your Linux distro so people keep buying Windows. It could even be considered another form of vendor lock in, except this time it's locking you into big business $$$ all hail capitalism VS opensource not everything has to have money running it.<p>There are usage cases for people outside of the bigcontent->consumer devices ecosystem. For example if I'm a game dev looking to put FMV videos into my game I can shop around for something proprietary like Blink or H.26X and fork over money for a 'off the shelf solution' or I can grab a open source library stick it in and not have to pay a dime. And who cares if it has to full back onto software decoding on Apple and Windows devices it's only a few minutes of playback and the game itself is going to be eating the battery much more. Similarly if I'm looking to implement some kind of video chat protocol.<p>Also if I'm on standards body looking to make a new standard for some new media or transmission format why use something that will require the companies making products get an extra overhead. Unfortunately we are likely to be stuck with H.26X derivatives from now on since it had gotten wide spread usage by being first to the gate and has so many companies backing it, generally with vested interests (the companies in the H.264 patent pool is basically every hardware manufacturer ever, I can't see how a fucking video codec can have that many patents on it)<p>Also patents on technology are now basically forever, not 20 years. Most technology doesn't last 20 years now days. Even the older industries that rely on 30 year old technology due to it's reliability are probably going to end up moving onto a fast update cycle (look at SpaceX making a new rocket in 2 years). We are unlikely to ever see H.26X free as they will just keep releasing newer versions with more patents on it and ensuring their employees on the various standards boards vote it in for things like new media format standards. Yeh, your media player doesn't have to pay for H.264 in the year 2030, but there is still a license cost for H.265 and by then they are up to H.269 with super retina display support and 3D volumetric holograms or whatever.<p>It also goes well beyond a single video codec. Look at the future of SD Cards, SDXC. It's using the exfat filesystem from Microsoft so every SD card reader will have a hidden MS tax attached to it for the next 20 years (by which time we will likely have abandoned the format and just be using some wireless storage standard, chances are it will have it's own licensing). Pretty much every device in existence has hundreds of companies receiving kickbacks (if they use H.264 there are hundreds right there). These licenses are generally not horrible individually but all this crap together with other stuff like DRM, secure boot loaders and so on makes a web trapping people to specific technologies, business interests and so on and generally just making alternatives such as Linux much more of a pain to use.",1368240208

Perhaps one day your average mid-western housewife will say ""I need a new saucepan, I'll just check Alibaba before I drive to the mall and pick one off the shelf at Walmart - if I can save $20 and only need to wait a week I'll just get it delivered.""<p>But like I said - I suspect it's ""experienced companies"" who are not exactly colluding or price-fixing, but who all know that it's better for _all_ of them to keep pans priced at ~$30 and have everybody make margins of almost $29 per sale, rather than end up trying to compete on price at $5/pan knowing that the total market for pans won't increase just 'cause the prices drop 85%.<p>(And sometimes, you get the evil-Walmart-effect, where someone big enough to absorb the temporary losses chooses to drop the consumer-expected pricing down to $2/pan, waits out until the competition goes broke and vanishes, then puts the prices back up near $30/pan while owning all or most of the market.)",1368239419

Most other languages do not have that property (Java's type system is static, give or take null, and strong, but not expressive, and Ruby's is strong but neither expressive nor static).  The Haskell type system lets you have conversations with the compiler about what your program should do.<p>You can declare a state type, and have the compiler tell you if you switch on the state and forget to handle one of the possible states (or if you add a state later and forget to update all the switches).<p>You can tell the compiler ""I think this function is a generally useful utility function that I plan to extract out of this project and use elsewhere"", and it will tell you whether there's some dependency on your project that you missed.<p>You can specify in a function's type ""this function should have access to the database""; then the compiler can tell you if you're trying to access the database somewhere you didn't expect to.  (A colleague has just spent a person-year of effort refactoring a Django web app, because all the database calls were happening in the view code, and they needed to abstract them out to scale.)<p>Of course there are ways to do some of those things in other languages, and of course there are also downsides to the static type system.

We use ffmpeg/x264, which is not only free but has better quality than expensive commercial tools. Even using those tools without paying a license is not permitted (although, obviously, most people simply don't understand that or willfully ignore banking that mpeg4 la won't sue them).<p>Microsoft and Apple pays so that users of their software can CONSUME mpeg4 format.<p>All CREATORS are left out in cold and have to license the patents.<p>Given that video becomes more and more ubiquitous, it's not an acceptable situation for the web just as it wasn't acceptable to have to pay for using .gif format to post a picture on your website (<a href=""http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/gif.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/gif.html</a>)",1368237811

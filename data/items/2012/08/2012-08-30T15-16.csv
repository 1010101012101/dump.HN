Think about the way we started Stack Overflow. We identified something on the web that needed to change. We viewed it as a strong villain figure that everybody vilified and hated. If you think about the software that you use on the web and the websites that you use, theres still a lot of software out there like this. Its kind of a forgotten software category in my opinion. But it wont be when were done, I think.

Were still building it. As I talked about at the start of the show, you get tired of explaining it after certain points, its like No, just go look at this thing. So were building up enough of it so that I can stop explaining it and just show it to people and theyll see what it is.

So, I'd like to hear your alternatives to a Back button in your experience. Even the example linked below, Sidetap <a href=""http://http://sidetap.it/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://http://sidetap.it/</a>, it toggles between the menu button and the Back button. An anti-pattern that I wouldn't really recommend.<p>The frequency of use is a variable between apps and users. Hopefully it's been taken into consider during UX / design.<p>This is what initiated our discussion. We simply didn't like the bottom menu bar that had 3 to 4 options and an elipses. The elipses takes you to another screen that lists the remaining options. It was a developing crutch for too many nav options. Our nav has 7 items this release and 8 to 9 next release. It is text only and the reason is because we limited each item to a 42px+ tap zones. We had issues with iconography as well as keeping it simple.<p>The opportunity for expansion is a positive feature of slide menus, no argument. In fact, that was the strongest argument for it initially and probably the single most reason if we convert to a slide at a later time. However, the counter argument is that if our navigation gets so wide as to scroll off screen then maybe we can reconsider the structure and revise. Opportunities abound.<p>I wish I could. It's in build phase slated for late Q4 release. Great counterpoints, btw.",1346341528

This way if you normally run at 90% of your capabilities, you can turn on caches and still be able to handle a massive traffic spike.<p>2. Backup servers. Make sure you have a way to quickly spin up more machines. If you're using EC2, just launch a few extra machines, it's really easy as long as it's not the database being the bottleneck.<p>3. Turn off anything unimportant. During the traffic spike of Obama, there were undoubtedly some background processes that could be ran later. Just pause those for a while and make them continue later. As long as it's a spike and the background processes aren't that important, this works well.<p>4. Turn off some front-end stuff. Reddit, for example, disabled commenting on Obama's IAMA for a while, instead forcing a cached version of the homepage. It really helps performance and doesn't really hurt the visitors too much. Sure, they can't comment, but with 15000 comments it's not likely that your comment gets read by Obama anyway.<p>On 1 and 2: always make sure you have room to handle spikes. Get backup servers ready but don't turn those into real production servers. Always ensure you have a buffer. Maybe embed some code that makes your site extra heavy, then give it a switch to turn off that extra code in case of a big spike?

If you just wanted to write a crypto tool, kudos, but this is not a good idea for production data. I also recommend focusing on system hardening versus throwing crypto and fewer lines of code at the problem. The net benefit is ten times that of a more complex set-up that only protects a corner case.<p>Take your original example: 17 servers and you want to share data between them on the internet. The most effective way to do this is to put them all on one or two hosting providers and use private IPs to connect them all via the same backend. This way there is no surface to attack (if the hoster VLAN'd your hosts correctly). Back in the day we used to do this by putting a private switch in a rack that nothing else could touch, but it seems the days of private cage monkeying has disappeared.<p>The other way is by using a VPN. A VPN is simply a network interconnect. Based on some authentication data, allow a host to connect to a private network. If done properly, there is no service to take advantage of and the daemon can run completely without any capabilities or system access, save of course network traffic. You then add firewalling to ensure only the right hosts get to the right services. You can even make this a single stand-alone VPS host to add granularity and separation of privilege, not to mention reduced attack surface.<p>Your tool is theoretically simpler in practice than either of those methods (I don't find setting up a VPN to be complex, but others might). But it comes with the same risks as OpenSSH, save that (I imagine?) you could set it up to be network-access-only like a VPN. The difference for a VPN being you wouldn't need to configure multiple instances of an application.",1346340608

I get the sense, from what I remember of his earlier writings, that his own views on issues have been updated by observing the path that China's development has followed since the end of the Cultural Revolution (back when I began studying the Chinese language and Sinology). There are an increasing number of observers who think the current governance and policies of China are unsustainable. I too think much of the gee-whiz reporting about China's ""inevitable rise"" in the last few years is very reminiscent of overoptimistic predictions of ""Japan as Number One"" back in the 1980s. Most likely, the more entrenched democracy and ability to criticize the government openly that the United States has as compared to China will help the United States muddle through and continue to be the world's sole superpower. First-generation immigrants from China like Pei will help that process of the United States adjusting to new world realities of the twenty-first century.",1346340185

The right hand hold of the device causes the user to hyperextend their thumb to reach. Additionally, the top left location is sometimes reserved for a Back button in a linear flowing app.<p>So, we tested the two navigation forms with users in our usability lab. We had 15 users come in and work on multiple devices with various mobile prototypes. We saw a clear case that users preferred a drop down menu located at top right.

How do you know this for a fact?  And just how old are these ""older people""?  I know plenty of people in their 60s with iPhones and Android phones that have dozens of apps they use regularly.  What makes the 18-30 year old crowd better than them?",1346339136

It isn't just Adobe people (the oracle in your comment) or Silicon Valley startups dismissing Gimp, it is the in-the-trenches graphic designers that do their work for $12/hr in a small rural town. That's a huge barrier to overcome. It isn't impossible, but with your other examples progress in numbers was seen all the time with MySQL. Not so much with Gimp, right?<p>(Also I'm not like all-in for Adobe. I'd love to see something hit the PS market, but I just don't see Gimp being the one to do it.

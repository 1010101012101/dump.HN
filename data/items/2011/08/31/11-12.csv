As someone who uses PHP on a regular basis, I'd love it if you could point out some of these ""eye stinging bugs"". I experiment a LOT with other languages and I don't find anything lacking in PHP that I need in a scripting language. I've never been unable to accomplish anything that I needed to in it, and I personally don't recall ever having to resort to unsightly hacks. All this whining is getting rather old. PHP is not Clojure, Ruby, Node or [insert your favorite language/tech here], and guess what? Some of us like that, a lot.",1314791872

2945090,comment,2943906,2944129,2,0,alttag,,,"Deterrence is a concept that has been studied regularly by criminologists, and to my understanding has been shown to have only minimal (inverse) correlation to wrongdoing. In some studies, deterrence has been separated into formal sanctions (e.g., court system, being fired from work), informal sanctions (e.g., disapproval of peers) and personal shame. (And each of these may be broken down further into certainty and severity.) Of these three, only formal sanctions demonstrates statistical effect, but in the presence of other factors (e.g., willingness to rationalize) its effect is very weak and almost disappears.<p>So yes, deterrence has a place, but it's a very minor one, and researchers have understood this for decades. Politicians and the public haven't yet caught on, perhaps because we seek concrete preventative measures or conflate deterrence and justice.",1314789722

2945081,comment,2942129,2942129,1,0,rbanffy,,,"I wouldn't laugh, but I am surprised it works. I have abandoned Cold Fusion in the late 90's - it kept hanging up, to the point of someone (me) having to write a program that detected the lockup and proceeded to restart the service. It may have become more reliable over the years, but I wouldn't know. CFML also has several drawbacks as a web programming language - the way it mixes presentation and application logic makes it hard to test properly and reminds me of what is wrong with a lot of PHP and JSP code out there.<p>I am also surprised someone claims it's faster to work on Windows than it is on a Unix-like OS. Most of the things I do on servers are moving files around, installing/updating packages and occasionally restarting a daemon. For that, clicking and dragging on a remote GUI is much less efficient than issuing equivalent commands in a shell.<p>I also read IIS progressed a lot since I last had to automate virtual server creation. Again, Apache runs on Windows and spitting (usually rendering from a template and adding custom values) a new config-file and doing a graceful restart appears simpler than right-clicking, form-filling and manually copying settings from one place to another. Windows doesn't even offer the courtesy of select/middle-button operation (unless you are operating IIS from the console).<p>Like someone else said, unless your infrastructure fails miserably (and CF/Windows failed me long ago) your app won't suck because of the technologies it stands upon. A good idea implemented in CF, PHP or ASP is just as good as a good idea implemented in Django or Rails or Node or Lisp. It's just that it may be harder to evolve it over time, or make it scale, or deploy it in the first place.",1314789519

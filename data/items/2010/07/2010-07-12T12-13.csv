I have some IBM/lenovo laptops too.  Some of the Panasonic business-rugged laptops (W, T, S series) are also nice, but driver support is often weak.<p>Linux itself on laptops sucks more than on any other platform -- driver support, ACPI/APM support, etc. all suffer vs. Mac.  OSX is a pretty decent Unix OS (although since I use ubuntu for most of my servers, the slight syntax variation vs. linux gets annoying).  I also really like having Keynote, Pages, and Numbers available -- OpenOffice just doesn't do it for me.  And, I use Adobe CS4 (mainly Illustrator and Photoshop).

How thick should it be, given that advances in technology could make it feasible to reduce the thickness significantly.<p>I'm not sure it's even possible to create a phone ""for the ages"". Even if you disregard the wear of the hardware: A phone design from even 5 years ago looks dated - maybe simply for the fact that it has been around for so long. And while you remain the same design, every company around you changes their designs.<p>At this point, the material cost of the outer shell of your phone is pretty insignificant compared to the rest of the hardware.

At some point someone suggested adding a Morse code interface to cell phones in order to speed up text messaging. A decent ""Morse coder"" apparently can beat the best teen texter in speed and accuracy. I can't remember where I read this but I'll post a link if I find it.",1278937066

He has a queasy feeling about a subject of the piece (not unlike the art connoisseurs might have), and investigates further. He turns up lots of dirt on Biro, enough to put his claims into doubt. He has enough to write an article. But he doesn't! He investigates the fingerprints further, and finds expert analysis that indicates that the fingerprints are phony. Not writing the article yet, he takes all of his evidence back to Biro to examine his reaction.<p>The editor also deserves credit. This is a damning article, but there is no evidence of sidestepping or evading the truth. All of the extra research was extremely time consuming, and when the author yelled, ""This guy is a fraud!"", he wasn't told to publish what he had, he was told, ""ok, show me the evidence.""<p>""The man who keeps finding famous fingerprints on uncelebrated works of art"" takes on a sinister tone after reading the article",1278936635

4175557,comment,4175508,4175508,6,0,meiji,,,"I have to agree and it happens in all areas but actually in a  slightly different form usually. To take the analogy from the post, you start walking 20 miles a day and then someone says that it seems easy to do that so why not up it to 30 miles a day. Before you know it, the 40 mile day is the expectation, off days are not allowed and you fall further and further behind, eventually succumbing to burnout and the whole thing ends badly.<p>Software projects are the same. Nearly every company I've worked at, a senior manager says ""Well if we can get these guys doing all this and they seem to be working well within their boundaries, lets push them harder"". Pushing people harder can be good if they are really just slacking, but for the most part, people can't sustain more than is comfortable for long periods of time without their work or their mental state suffering. The end result is crappy code, people who leave companies or those that become non-functioning because they're burned.",1340953022

For example on Netbeans you could have a good workflow similar to Yeoman. By using shortcuts you can push changes to your test instance, it has plenty of integration with Ant, Phing, Hudson/Jenkins, Github, other bunch of plugins, etc. It has a fully functional bash shell window, shortcuts that trigger the browser. You barely don't have to switch to anything while coding on it.<p>I get that IDEs like Netbeans have a bigger memory print, but what I mean is that using a tool container that gathers` all your other tools together is really nothing new.<p>Am I missing something here? What do you guys think? oh and I don't want to start a vi vs IDEs war here. I'm talking about the concept.",1340950825

They don't want to carry two devices, one for home, one for work. The home one being technically advanced.<p>The cost of the IT fortresses is prohibitive and it is now being understood that IT departments with overzealous IT security policies ruined the actual use cases of technology.<p>Example:
Top15 big pharma co. BB as the corporate standard, fully locked down. PIN lock activates the sec the screen goes dark. PIN is a alphanumeric password. Camera, Browser - pretty much everything is disabled. Windows Notebooks? VPNs, rotating passwords, dongles, e-mail mailboxes of 500mb, no e-mail retention, etc.<p>IT argues that this makes them ""compliant"".<p>Then, suddenly, strangely coincidental with the rise of Apple post 2007 a big shift starts. SaaS solutions are starting to replace on-premise stuff, Big pharco has realized that their IT really <i>sucks</i> in terms of its job. The headcount, cost overhead is in no relation to the pain it causes. Everything is <i>no</i>, everything takes ages, when it arrives it is unusable.<p>And now we are at bring your own device. Whatever works. iPads everywhere. iOS takes care of security and OS updates. No more we can't update to WinXP SP3 because we're still testing it.<p>Just had a meeting with another big pharco yesterday, where BB is corporate standard.

Then, soon, they should start working on 2.1, which isn't API compatible with a version that's compatible with IE 6/7/8.

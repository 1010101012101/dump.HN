116491,comment,116262,116431,0,0,mdipierro,,,"This funny because when web2py started we aimed at being small like web.py. In fact the core web2py functionalities (from gluon import *) are very similar to web.py and the entire core is less the 120KB. Ocan still use it that low level and import SQLAlchemy and Mako for example (with loss of some of the higher level functionalities of course, like the database administrative interface).<p>Anyway, I agree with Cosmin's assessment that it grew to do a lot more. The main phylosophy is that the framework should make (by default) some decisions for the user, in particular particular about things that have to do with security and persistance.<p>At high level web2py borrowed some ideas from Django (the administrative interface and {{...}} in templates), some from Turbogears (response.flash?) and some from cherrypy (@cache).",1203086917

All we were waiting for is a decent UI and a real browser and a qwerty keyboard for mobile devices.<p>I also predict that future mobile phones will also try to increase the screen sizes.<p>I also predict that Apple will repeat their same mistake by tieing their OS to their Hardware, and that googles Android OS will be the next windows of all other Mobile devices.<p>I also predict that it will take Apple long to realise that they could have eliminated or a least make it harder for Google's android by licensing their mobile software to other phone companies such as Nokia!

116485,comment,116374,116428,0,0,jmzachary,,,"I agree with you, on both counts. It seems very ironic to have a toolbar app that monitors and prevents your use of the web. This is a behavioral problem (procrastination, time wasting, boredom, poor management), not a technical problem. This seems like a simple feature that browser developers could easily build in.",1203086236

116479,comment,116079,116079,0,0,fiftyone,,,"I had a really great job in the music biz when I was 20-21 but after 9/11 I converted to Islam and decided it was a good idea to quit my life and move to the Middle East to study Arabic. I had an Airline ticket, $250 bucks and enough high hopes and faith to fill the Staples Center.
I had decided to go to Egypt, ( it was Syria or Egypt at the time because they were the cheapest places to go) my idea was to learn Arabic and return to the states to work as a translator ( that never happened haha ) Anyhow, my $250 bucks got me an apartment with a couple other American guys ( who were believe it or not on the same spiritual journey I was on ) for $35 bucks a month. I ended up taking some money from mom a couple times but I did it mostly on my own. Anyhow, now 2008, I married an Egyptian girl, I have a 6 Month old baby boy and a new carrier as a teacher. Not bad for leaving with 200 bucks and a couple T-shirts :)",1203085735

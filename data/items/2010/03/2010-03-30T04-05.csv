</code></pre>
Perfectly legal function declaration.  You can omit variable names in the signature.<p><pre><code>  {
    ...
  }
</code></pre>
That defines a scope, which is also fine and occasionally used so that variable names can be recycled with other types later on.<p><pre><code>  int a = 1;
</code></pre>
You claim this is redundant; I'm not sure why<p><pre><code>  if (b = 0) {
</code></pre>
If there was a variable in scope named <i>b</i>, this would be legal (the one from above isn't), though probably not what's intended since it would always be false as it will contain the value assigned to <i>b</i>.  This syntax is however sometimes used for things like:<p><pre><code>  if((location = find_something()) != -1) {
</code></pre>
All of that said, if somebody claimed ""years of C++ experience"" and didn't immediately notice <i>loads</i> of errors in this in about 2 microseconds, they're either a horrible programmer or a liar, and in either case you don't want to remotely consider hiring them.",1269924114

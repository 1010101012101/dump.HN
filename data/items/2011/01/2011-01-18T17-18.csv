Know the limitations of the technology you use, and change your behaviors appropriately (or change the technology).<p>EDIT: I see that at least five people disagree with me. My reasoning is mostly related to the fact that, when I submit articles, I get the URLs from an RSS reader, which invariably means that there's a huge amount of junk at the end.

I believe Facebook has the potential to bring a new form of online ads, for example, a new interactive game-like  campaign that virally spread across the friend network with those participants given incentives like Facebook credits.<p>It's rather limiting to think Facebook as an advertiser like Google. The real potential of Facebook is way beyond this. Facebook is not just connecting people to their friends. It is a middleman - a platform that connects customers to vendors, fans to artists, and gamers to game developers, and there could be much more than these. Think iOS as a platform that connects mobile users and app developers and how it has worked out - and would have worked out even it was a standalone company. Maybe someone will develop an Amway-style direct selling platform on Facebook. Maybe someone could develop a CRM and compete with salesforce.com for SMB. Or maybe a Priceline clone with social features would emerge. And good thing is Facebook does not need to do all these. It just need to inspire a developer community around it and evolve its platform to support new possibilities.<p>It's gold rush again, and like last time - it wasn't the gold miners that get rich; it was the people who sold the miners and other gold rush followers the tools and supplies they needed.",1295371273

If you're offering free calls, sure you can get users.

In my opinion, if Facebook wanted to monetize, it can tenfold its revenues easily considering the amount of users it has. But the company continues to place users before hand and refuse to compromise user experience for money, and THAT IS VERY DIFFERENT , or opposite if you will, from the Ponzi Scheme.  Ads are not suppose to be 100% effective, and that's the foundation every marketer needs to know. They have to be prepared to throw lots of money into a marketing strategy, and accept the fact that it might fail.

There was a period of time where development had stopped IIRC because the developer didn't see the purpose in it anymore.  Again IIRC he started again after seeing that the community wanted it to be kept alive.<p>I haven't seen a version in about 2 years now as my last client finally moved off of it due to the desire for 'cloud' style email and Blackberry support but Pegasus never let them down while they were on it.",1295370098

It is fundamentally different from the ad platform that is Google. People go to Google to find something they need, possibly ready to buy, which a good percentage of the time can in fact be solved by someone's ad. Facebook ads, on the other hand, annoy users. They yield no real value, and thus no profits.",1295370038

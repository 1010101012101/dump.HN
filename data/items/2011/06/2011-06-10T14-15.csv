Anon is a bunch of man-children (or actual children) 'fighting the man' behind anonymity from their parents' basements in suburbia. It's not cool or heroic. I completely don't understand this mentality that what Anon is doing should be commended. It's vigilantism and there's a reason that's not good 'IRL'.<p>Also I don't know what 'freedom' Arab terrorists are fighting for. The common trope is that they're fighting 'Western imperialism', but that's insane -- the most worn out excuse that the Arab world has used for their lack of innovation or scientific contribution since 1100[1].

2641054,comment,2640511,2640953,2,0,asmosoinio,,,"Have you used an iPhone / Android device?<p>Because Google and Apple have pretty much nailed this. That is exactly what they have: a database with ENOUGH of the GSM (CMDS) basestatio cellids and WLAN identifiers, linked to real coordinates, so that most of the time things ""just work"".<p>So all the phone needs is to use some mobile data to get this database, at least once before it caches the local id => coordinates information. After this, a rough location is available even without GPS.<p>How can they do this? Because everytime someone somewhere uses Google Maps with GPS, they are also submitting data to Google's cellid and WLAN databases. So it works really well in countries and areas with lots of smartphone users, and less so when you go to the outskirts of the Philippines.<p>Also: Landmarks work pretty well even with the non exact cellid location, you definitely don't need to have GPS enabled to use the app.<p>This is basic platform functionality, which is why we didn't emphasize it in the text: However maybe we should add some information about this as well.",1307717637

Indian IT Services and Consulting companies (Infy,Wipro,TCS,Cognizant,Mahindra,HCL and 100 more) have engineering work which is as good as any of their counter parts in the world. This is proven by reshift in the delivery pie in the last decade. So, by saying these jobs are useless you are discrediting the whole of the IT services and consulting industry jobs across the world which include IBM, Accenture, Capgemeni, HP.<p>2. We are talking about product focussed companies and services focussed companies in the IT space. But both the types of companies have the other offering. It is the proportion of their revenues which varies. IT Companies keep shifting their portfolio of products and services based on market need - Infosys 3.0 is an example. So generalizing job nature on a company basis based on ones experience only is point less.<p>3. IT Services/ITO and consulting industry generates  business revenues of US$595 billion across the world, this includes the services divisions of product companies. All product revenues put together is about $250 billion. So if every guy would work for only IT product focussed companies there would not be enough jobs.<p>4.

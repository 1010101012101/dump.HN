While not noticing an incredibly obvious security hole is serious, it's <i>somewhat</i> understandable in the context of a site that unintentionally goes public before it's ready.

4619906,comment,4618808,4619784,2,0,thaumaturgy,,,"It just so happens that I have the very best test site possible for this argument: one of my alpha customers has a website built by Not-A-Professional with an incredible 156 requests and 2.39MB of data <i>for the landing page</i>. It is exactly the opposite of an optimized website.<p>So I tested the page load with KeepAlive on and KeepAlive off. I `/etc/init.d/apache2 graceful`'d before each test, and I cleared Chrome's cache before each test. I have nothing else running on my system right now and our pipe is nice and clear. I have a 92ms ping from the office to my web server.<p>KeepAlive On: 5.31s<p>KeepAlive Off: 6.87s<p>1.5 seconds is an appreciable difference. It works out to roughly 10ms per request, unless it's so late that the math part of my brain has quit for the night. If Yahoo.com were loaded from my web server, having KeepAlive on would delay total page load by about 750ms -- a noticeable difference. (However, given that it takes over 4 seconds to reach page load on yahoo.com for 70+ requests, their page might actually load <i>faster</i> if it were hosted on my server...)<p>Now here's the kicker: that same customer site has been featured on a popular radio show, twice, driving over 6 million hits over 24 hours, with peak traffic at 40Mb/s, thousands of simultaneous connections, and 100+ requests per second, sustained for several hours.<p>The site's loading time during that period was utterly unaffected. Seriously, never even a blip. (I stayed up during the whole period just to personally watch it.)<p>I wasn't about to experiment with turning on KeepAlive during all that fun, but I'm reasonably confident that having KeepAlive turned on would have <i>crushed</i> that server, given that my customer's site was receiving substantially more traffic than even Pinboard did immediately after the Delicious announcement (<a href=""http://blog.pinboard.in/2011/03/anatomy_of_a_crushing/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://blog.pinboard.in/2011/03/anatomy_of_a_crushing/</a>) -- traffic that Pinboard's founder notes will usually kill an unprepared site (or server).<p>And keep in mind, this was all on a memory-constrained tiny little vm.<p>So here's my final statement on KeepAlive, which I will link back to from now on: if, as a server admin, you're turning KeepAlive on to speed up your site, then you are optimizing your server and your site in exactly the wrong way.",1349502592

4619898,comment,4618633,4619018,0,0,quink,,,"> The problem with having your code all in a software image is that the second you do this you lose a large existing toolset that people have invested a lot in mastering.<p>Intersystems Cach.<p>There's a CACHE.DAT, which sits on the filesystem as a giant monolithic file. It's just a big block device containing a B-tree. In some nodes of that B-tree you'll find binary code. There are specialised tools to manage all this. In other nodes you will find data. There are specialised different tools to manage all this.<p>There is the one virtual machine and it only runs one language fairly well, called MUMPS. There is an object-oriented addition to it. It's basically a huge bunch of macros that compiles down to... MUMPS.<p>You can, in a hackish way, sometimes call specific functions from a DLL but that's as far as it gets. However, effectively...<p>No libraries. At all. And that's the biggest pain.<p>No libraries. I want you to let that sink in. All those things on Github and SourceForge and everywhere you, simply put, can't use.<p>No libraries. Except the few that the vendor, Intersystems, chooses to eventually let you have... with often broken functionality. There will never be any UI toolkit or Javascript interpreter or HTML engine or nice XML parser or any of those things. There is a crappy JSON parser, but that's about it in terms of recent niceties, and it's only there because some other customer would have paid for it.<p>No libraries. And that's the biggest problem with these software image things.<p>No libraries.<p>The biggest advance that we managed to get in was installing hooks in the proprietary source code editor (no vim or choice of text editor here) to export and import the code from disk. On save and load. It helped a lot to be able to get all the classes into actual files that we could use SVN with and made things so so much easier.<p>Software images might be a good idea in theory.<p>But in practice, you are throwing out your file browser, your text editor, your libraries and everything, everything, else.",1349502261

But the problem is that the defaults are insecure -- every table can be accessed, every record is available, every field can be edited, and the URLs for doing so are (deliberately) easily guessable.<p>One of the simplest and most fundamental rules of effective security is to close everything down by default and only open things up as required, after careful consideration. Scaffolding breaks that rule.",1349499644

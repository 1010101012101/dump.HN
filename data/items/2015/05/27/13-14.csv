A lot of court decisions regarding copyrightability explicitly mention this. Note, patents usually don&#x27;t cover the formalized description itself (mainly because it would result in an overly narrow patent) but rather what you can use software to do.<p>Here&#x27;s a claim from the infamous one-click patent:<p><i>1. A method of placing an order for an item comprising:\nunder control of a client system,<p>displaying information identifying the item; and\nin response to only a single action being performed, sending a request to order the item along with an identifier of a purchaser of the item to a server system;<p>under control of a single-action ordering component of the server system,<p>receiving the request;<p>retrieving additional information previously stored for the purchaser identified by the identifier in the received request; and<p>generating an order to purchase the requested item for the purchaser identified by the identifier in the received request using the retrieved additional information; and\nfulfilling the generated order to complete purchase of the item<p>whereby the item is ordered without using a shopping cart ordering model.</i><p>It&#x27;s a description alright, but there&#x27;s nothing mathematical or formalized about it (though a software implementation would be a lot of code - formalized description - that <i>applies</i> a bunch of mathematics).",1432735062

This war is won by distribution. Your mom doesn&#x27;t go to the store to buy an android phone. She goes to buy a phone. Which phone? The one that the friendly employee at the store proposes. Which one is that? The one that the store manager tells the employee to push. Which phone is that? The one that corporate headquarters tells stores to push. Which phone is that? The ones with lucrative kickback schemes. Which phones are that? The ones that manufacturers decide.<p>Which phones will they decide on? The phones in partnerships with the company that changes their agreements and APIs every quarter? Maybe they will chose the company that they have a very profitable partnership going on for 3 decades. The company that has the power to waive a magic stick and turn them from unprofitable/breakeven to well into the green. Comapnies pay a lot of money to MSFT every year on patents. Samsung paid $1bn last year alone. Every manufacturer is losing money on smart phones because of that. Guess what? If you push our phone, we can share those patents with you. Oh, btw, we can subsidize those windows phones, give you some cash advance on the OS you sell for us just to stitch things up for the next few quarters.<p>Microsoft is all about business. Big business. Big partnerships. They suffocate competition in a very deliberate manner. Google hasn&#x27;t competed ever with anyone. Moreover, Erick Smidt tanked Novel back in the day because of poor relationships with their partners.<p>On top of that, the OS will be good. Nobody will complain. Lots of phones will be sold in the lower end market. Some corporate deals will be done for the mid and high end markets and the ball will get rolling. Developers will be happy too. MSFT is making big progress in that lately. You also get the added bonus of developing for the windows PC and tablet platforms, in addition to the phone platform. Everyone will make lots of money. Except google.",1432734516

But the underlying problem of fixing old bugs in images remains, along with that its contents are often a disorganized mess: Coming straight from the developer as a black box (more or less) into production environments (yeah when has that ever been a good idea?).<p>Docker IMO creates a &quot;never touch a running system&quot; attitude. The &quot;running system&quot; in this case is the docker image which nobody dares touching after the developer has left the company. (or the developer themselves have no idea anymore what it contained 3 weeks later)<p>Also the overhead of setting up containers in a secure way is even more work than not using docker in the first place (ever had too look seriously into SElinux? not something you do casually on the side as it&#x27;s massively complex).<p>So the justification that &quot;by using docker we save time on deployment&quot; is a farce. I guess it creates new jobs though for container specialists.<p>to paraphrase Theo de Raadt:<p>‟You are absolutely deluded, if not stupid, if you think that a worldwide collection of software engineers who can’t write operating systems or applications without security holes, can then turn around and suddenly write virtualization layers without security holes.”<p>EDIT: is it still possible in Docker/LXD to access /proc/sys/kernel/panic or /sys/class/thermal/cooling_device0/cur_state ?

9611164,comment,9611052,9611052,0,0,DigitalSea,,,"Everyday I wonder how the heck Tony Abbott even came into power. The LNP are so backwards when it comes to technology, if they had their way schools would be teaching us to use a typewriter instead of a computer. This is just embarrassing, the rest of the world are laughing at Australia as our PM and his cohorts drag us back into the stoneage. Worth pointing out is the title is a little sensationalist and inaccurate as Tony didn&#x27;t say specifically coding is a joke, but Tony&#x27;s arrogance and sarcasm to me signals that he sees coding as a joke and not a viable industry that Australia should capitalise on for the future. We&#x27;re talking about a guy who lets his religious beliefs get in the way of passing a bill to allow same sex couples to marry.<p>Currently Australia is having some issues. A little while ago we hit a natural resources boom where the price of iron ore in particular (once one of our biggest exports) dropped so low that it has cost thousands of people their jobs and in turn has had a flow-on effect felt through the mining industry. The sad thing is, Tony Abbott seems to be stuck in this old mindset of Australia must export natural resources and beef, when we should be teaching children how to code.<p>As a self-taught developer who has always had an interest in computers and coding, I wish when I went to primary school they taught basic coding in the higher grades (maybe 6 and 7). Funnily enough, my primary school actually had some visual basic programming books I would go to the library and lunch time, read and then hire out to experiment with at home. I was reading these in grade 3 onwards, even though a lot of it went over my head, I wanted to learn and nobody but myself to help me understand it.<p>As everything becomes more automated and unskilled blue collar positions are replaced with driverless vehicles and bricklaying robots, moving towards a technology industry position makes sense.<p>But there is a problem. We teach kids to code and then what, they get to use a sub-par internet infrastructure in the form of the LNP&#x27;s NBN. A few years ago when Kevin Rudd was the PM he introduced the NBN (National Broadband Network) which was to be a fibre to the home internet infrastructure to help move Australia into the future. Sadly the LNP came into power and the claimed Labors plan was too expensive and they had a better plan, which was fibre to the node.<p>A less sexy and future proof network that still relies on copper for the last mile or so to the users house from a junction box. The kicker is the minimum expected average speed will be 25mb, still better than I currently get, but a laughable speed compared to many parts of the world (including New Zealand).<p>Things are pretty dire here. Some parts of the developed world have gigabit internet connections now, yet I can&#x27;t even get decent speeds to stream Netflix in standard quality and I live 12 kilometers from the main CBD.<p>We are stuck in the past. The good old days of the mining boom are behind us, experts are saying things will never be as good as they at the peak of the mining boom when one tonne of iron ore could fetch almost $200 per tonne, now it&#x27;s like $40.",1432733532

I opted to use pyparse to create a working recursive descent parser to pick out the relevant bits of text.<p>At this point I was wary of completing the parser for all cases found in the database table, so I decided to build it only for a few base cases which I threw in to a unit test.  I reasoned I could still demonstrate my skills without giving them much free work.<p>The solution worked well, and I submitted it to Joe, the CTO, for review.  A few hours later Joe contacted me complaining that the code crapped out after trying to run the code against their database table.  He then offered me a github branch to continue work on the problem.  I sent them the nicest e-mail I could muster explaining that I felt the code adequately demonstrated my skills and that the error is due to the parser not handling all cases of the problem text.<p>Joe&#x27;s responded with &quot;I am only trying to evaluate your work, not on just how the code looks, which is clean and well organized, but that it works correctly on the data as well.  I asked advice since the program crashed on the 5th package, which didn&#x27;t give me enough data to verify, and I wasn&#x27;t sure if it was just a system-related issue or something quickly fixed.&quot;<p>Lastly I responded with &quot;Sorry for any confusion, I was just giving you a sample of my work. The system error you mentioned is a result of the code being a sample. The cases that do work are found in the test.&quot;<p>Naturally they haven&#x27;t gotten back to me, even though my code more than adequately met the challenge.  Perhaps Joe the CTO did not understand that the other cases would be trivial to implement.  In that case, perhaps I&#x27;ve dodged a bullet.  A CTO should know better.<p>I&#x27;m wondering if anyone else has had similar experiences.  How did you handle it?  How did the interviewers respond?",1432733303

9611070,comment,9609022,9609022,0,0,anifow,,,"We have a perfect solution for the kind of publishing model which Brett is referring to, which operates in sharing and replication rather than central repositories which are historically prone to snuffing out. Just use Bittorrent.<p>Bittorrent was embraced for pirating music and movies, but it has major benefits if adopted as a back-end protocol for distribution of content on mobile devices. Bandwidth isn&#x27;t an issue as long as everything is done on WiFi when plugged in, then it&#x27;s just like a laptop. You are obviously looking at poorer seed ratios than the desktop-centric distribution we are used to, but it will be relatively cheaper for content distributors to support some of the seeding with their data centers than to absorb the entire responsibility. Granted, this is way less efficient than just doing central distribution from a data center, but you gain in resilience, and since you aren&#x27;t depending on this for the navigation and basic UI, the user experience isn&#x27;t dependent on real time network transfers which still are very from being dependable. This model might not work for everyone, but I think it is the ideal model for sharing data sets, academic papers, DRM videos and music (though I&#x27;d prefer non-DRM), public digital arts projects, and rich interactive news stories (with a collection of video, models, etc). The Web was great when bandwidth was expensive, but today it is cheap and unevenly distributed, and it is time for a new model.<p>Apps can serve as trackers which curate links (bonus points if Android / iOS bake the protocol into the OS so that your device can keep track of torrents without that information being locked into your app (can probably get some efficiencies in managing sharing if those settings are centralized in the OS). I also wonder if seed ratios can be shared between different distributors and bought and sold from data centers. It seems only fair. It does go against net neutrality though, as I can imagine a situation where people are given less bandwidth because they don&#x27;t have a seed ratio of 100 or something (i.e., 100 GB of upload for every 1 GB of download). Nonetheless, this may be a fairly healthy way of having people with better means subsidize the content to those less fortunate. You can even run all monetization of this scheme by having the distribution networks downloading it to themselves, jacking up the seed ratios that are possible.<p>Someone else here mentioned the need for an app ecosystem that treats apps as adversarial. I think that is exactly what we have seen with Android and iOS. Want to use my camera? You need permission. Granted, there are some social engineering issues with people not really considering the rights they give up when they tap on the Install button,even when it is spelled out in simple language (I can say this because I know I don&#x27;t care as much as I should, so it&#x27;s not coming from a lack of technical knowledge). I think it&#x27;s a short matter of time before Android becomes a serious competitor to Windows. iOS is more tricky as it would cannibalize the Mac ecosystem which is heavily built up. Things that would signal things moving in that direction are for example, Adobe releasing a complete version of photoshop on one of these mobile first OS. Also, Microsoft releasing their tools on Android (unless they keep that as a competitive advantage of the windows os, which is likely).<p>In either case, I think the death of the Web is near on mobile. The benefits include more safety, more functionality, a collection of trusted brands (unfortunately, innovation WILL be hampered by this move. People will accept toy apps that don&#x27;t take permissions, but otherwise people will have a really hard time competing in the Web ghetto)",1432732490

Even with very few opportunities the competition here is fierce. For eg, to get into IIM or IIT (equivalents of Harvard or MIT in US), you need more then just knowledge to get selected amongst hundreds of thousands.<p>Even after studies the competition is fierce. The Indian middle class dream continues to pursue job as a career and very few take entrepreneurship as a career.",1432731837

1222949,comment,1222919,1222940,0,0,rufugee,,,"Apparently you live in an alternate universe. I've been using Linux for my desktop OS since 1999, and Ubuntu since 2004, and it's been a consistently great experience. Sure, there are warts on occasion, but that's true with all OSes. Ubuntu has been solid enough to keep me productive by day (as a CTO of a company of over 1000 employees), and by night (as a consultant). I even bought a MacBook Pro last year and gave OS X a try. It lasted around a month. My frustration with its completely odd UI design decisions, dismal package management (ports, fink), and second-class treatment of open source software led me to install Ubuntu on the laptop and wipe OS X. Couldn't be happier with it now.<p>2010 may not be the year of Linux on the consumer desktop, but it's another year of Linux on <i>my</i> desktop, and I couldn't be happier.",1269697386

Sometimes lots of work.<p>I believe a solution to this has to do with <i>how</i> math is taught, as opposed to just abolishing the subject altogether. I don't hate math any longer - I can sometimes see the beauty in it, and I sure as hell know that it comes in handy, especially when working with computers.<p>But even if it isn't taught properly - there is something to be said for doing math at an elementary level. Working on math problems tend to give you a certain kind of mental tenacity, that would come in handy later. The question, really, is how to make math seem fun/relevant - especially when it gets more abstract.<p>Steven Strogatz has some cool ideas:

But maths was one of the few things I enjoyed at school, so I absolutely see no point in removing it from the curriculum.<p>There are some school forms (like Montessori I think, quite popular here in Germany), where pupils can apparently choose for themselves what they want to learn at any particular moment.

However, I think Yegge wasted too much thought on this. It is the software that dictates how conservative a piece of software is: bugs and stability are generally tolerated in user-facing software because at worst the user has a bad experience. However, a database better be as close to 100% reliable as possible, which in turn leads to testing and static analysis, meaning typing... It is not really negotiable.<p>I think there are way too many variables for a linear scale to provide meaningful comparison.",1344592798

The strength of PHP is its focus on the web environment through features and functions that make it simpler to develop in that environment, that have be implemented in code on most other languages. In addition, the huge amount of available mature libraries for a variety of purposes and the large community that supports it, is something I really find hard to believe Go can compete with.

     ""liberal"" than Java
</code></pre>
Only if you look at these languages in isolation from their virtual machines and operating systems on top of which they run, also disregarding the communities around them.<p>Java as a language is more conservative, definitely, but the Java ecosystem is definitely more liberal. As proof, compare Java's open-source community with .NET. Or compare the maturity of alternative JVM languages (e.g. Scala, Clojure, JRuby), with the alternatives running on top of .NET ; or compare the web frameworks available for each.<p>This is the reason why, when faced with a choice, a ""liberal"" developer will most likely pick Java over C#, even if C# as a language is more liberal.<p><pre><code>     Only very brave--very liberal--companies are going to

I do not think this is an issue of liberals versus conservatives. It's actually an issue of pragmatism versus idealism.<p>I'm pretty sure that many people wanted to use Haskell or Scheme in production, but then they'd shoot themselves in the foot, because the available libraries and tools for a language are far, far more important than the language itself. That's why Perl was so successful in the first place, because Perl hackers were getting shit done, then contributing to CPAN, which allowed other hackers to get their own shit done, and so on.<p>On the other hand I'm seeing lots of startups trying out and even using Clojure and Scala in production, at least for parts of the project. That's because these languages have all the Java libraries at their disposal, even if the languages themselves are still immature.<p>Don't mistake pragmatism for conservatism.

Although it might seem simple there are few flaws in it.<p>a) What happens if the user want to register the available domain, wait but we already added it to our queue for automatic registration. So we need to check if the user goes through with the registration or not.<p>b) We are going to make millions $ holding domains hostages. But since every registration will cost goddaddy atleast $5.50 to ICANN and that there are millions of searches of domains in a month, well it certainly is one way to tank your company.<p>c) Alright lets then try to filter out only the popular domain name searches. But how do we determine what is popular and what is not popular. Common words? Trends? Hyphenation? Numbers? TLD? User Profiling?<p>d) Lets hold the domain hostage and make the user wait until they agree to backorder it from us. That will always work out for user retention.<p>Given that I used to own a lot of domains from Godaddy, I can attest to the fact that they have much simpler ways to hold your domains hostage if they wanted to. For example: When a domain is about to expire, the sheer volume of emails you get from Godaddy reminding you to renew is outright annoying. If they had to score better money, cut it down to just one and sent them about 4 weeks before the expiration. When most people forget to do it, go ahead and charge them $80 to get it back from redemption!!",1344591303

It was used extensively in China and Cambodia. Not to mention by the Pinocet regime in Chile, by the South African police under Apartheid, and even all the way back to Spanish Inquisition.<p>In fact, the underlying assumption you are using when you compare waterboarding to the torture used by other countries is the invalid premise that torture performed in America can never be as bad as the torture performed in other countries who have historically had poor human rights records. This is a falacious argument.<p>To remind you exactly what waterboarding is:<p>You bind an individual, then place a cloth over the subject's mouth and eyes. You strap them to an inclined bench. You then poor water over the cloth which restricts air flow. You then poor water for 20 to 40 seconds continuously on the cloth. This causes the subject to believe they are drowning (Fox News, not exactly a bastion of independent reporting, once did a demonstration and the subject gagged).<p>You then let the subject take two or three breaths and repeat. This process can be repeated for up to 20 to 30 minutes. That's 20 to 30 minutes of becoming close to drowning.<p>You say this is not significant torture? Either you are dissembling, or you are ignorant. Either way, you are wrong. It is torture pure and simple. People have actually drowned in U.S. custody while being water boarded, so you can't ever argue that it's not mortally dangerous.<p>None of what I'm saying is even remotely delusional. I took all of this information from well documented facts, one of which was a report from the U.S. Office of Legal Counsel.<p>Water boarding is a disgusting and heinous act. Those using it should be charged with the crime of torture. Anyone advocating it should be treated with contempt.",1344591252

 The labour laws protect unions; many businesses simply do not want to create large manufacturing jobs due to historical labour trouble.

We don't have a Scott Walker (R-Wisconsin) here to take these labour unions on.

Take a FIX session adapter (very common software in the financial services world), baseline is around 5Gb/hour but its susceptible to fairly extreme fluctuation.<p>When you roll the logs at say 500Mb, there's the chance our monitoring system misses an error in the tail of the previous log as the logs roll (which could in the worst cases mean loosing a couple of million or even more).<p>Multiple logfiles for a day are harder to search through when handling the most common use case for log files, which is not debugging but ops staff answering questions on 'what happened with X?'<p>What benefits does a split logfile provide? The one use case is transferring logs across the network. However most log management systems already split large logs up before transferring to the archive silo.<p>You're loosing a lot, but gaining nothing with split logs.<p>>> When logging high volumes<p>It makes no difference, when the market swings you're going to need an extra 200Gb anyway, whether the logs are in chunks or not. In large volume apps deleting to make space is often not an option - you're logging in high volumes for a reason (often regulatory).<p>>> fetching an arbitrary header from the right file for a given context can be rather painful.<p>That's been a solved problem for a very long time. Just as recombining a separate trace log with a main app log based on time stamp is a solved problem. I believe this highlights the bigger problem, you can go to university or a.n. other school and learn to be a developer. Where can you go to learn operations? The net result is people come up with the own solutions each time instead of building on work already done. That work is available but its often passed on by word of mouth. Surprisingly hard even in today's world to find decent blogs on ops work (thankfully there are more around now).<p>>> When a serious error occurs then as much context as feasible must be provided<p>Yes this is the extraordinarily rare case where stack traces can be useful. They still don't belong in the main app log though.<p>Push to a separate trace log and recombine on the fly when you need to view. The benefits are to the ops team and the monitoring system.<p>Another approach not often mentioned is black box logging. Log to a circular buffer in memory, the first bytes of the buffer are set to a pattern that can be searched for in a core dump, the remainder is used as a circular buffer. It's fast to log to, takes no disk space and provides crucial context in the event of a crash.<p>Im not sure I'll be able to convince you based on your tone, but speaking from experience, you are making the most common mistakes.",1344589208

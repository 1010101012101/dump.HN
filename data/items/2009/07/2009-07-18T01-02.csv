I don't think they're fuck-something-up-proof, but I believe firmly that the company as a whole cares about its users and about giving them the best experience possible, even when it's at cost to them.

711208,comment,710994,711108,0,0,bprater,,,"Agreed, pot is a psychoactive drug and it does affect everyone in a unique way. In fact, all drugs are going to play with everyone's brains in unique ways. Personally, I don't hack while high, I've never found it helpful. Others will have a different experience, because their brains are wired differently than mine.<p>If you've wanted to experiment with drugs and aren't sure how to start, here are a few tips that have helped me. (For those of you headed to Burning Man, this could be useful!)<p>One: read up or talk to someone about the effects a drug might have on you. (Google 'erowid'.) Make sure it's something you can tolerate and want to do. Allow yourself to be prepared for it's effects. Psychedelics like LSD or mushrooms can be an overwhelming experience. Don't be scared; just be prepared. Drugs last a finite amount of time and then you are back to exactly who you are now.<p>Two: make sure that wherever you get the drugs from, it's as reputable as possible. For instance, in Amsterdam, it's popular to test Ecstasy after purchase and prior to consumption.<p>Three: initially take drugs with a experienced guide. A guide They will help with dosage and proper consumptive techniques. They will be able to help you if things are getting intense or if you need to talk.<p>Four: Never, ever try drugs at a random party around people you don't know. And never allow peer pressure to push you into trying something you don't want to do. (You'll know you are around the right people to experiment with, because you'll never be pressured. They will understand.)<p>Five: don't do drugs when you are at an emotional low in your life. This is how addictions occur. People find that life inside the drug ""bubble"" is better than real world. I know people who have played with heroin and are not addicts.<p>Six: Don't overdo it. Take it slow. It can take time for you to experience the subtleness of many drugs. And most importantly, have fun. You might be surprised just how many of the people around you regularly experiment.<p>If you are opposed to drugs, don't do them. But I would suggest trying to keep an open mind to what they can offer you, which is primarily a shift in consciousness. You get to see the world in a slightly different way and for some, it can be life-altering. Many people have had profound experiences (including myself) by experimenting with a variety of drugs. And I didn't start until my late '20s, because I was one of those ""freaked out by the thought of drugs"" people.<p>Final tip: if you really want to play, here's the perfect way to do it: go to a concert, take a friend and share a joint together. (Obviously, it should be legal to smoke pot where you live.) I think you might be surprised by the way you experience the show. I'm willing to wager you'll never watch a show again without being stoned.",1247881878

711189,comment,710743,710795,0,0,pedalpete,,,"I disagree. The purpose of android may be specifically so google can own more of your time and link more closely with your digital life. On iPhone & Blackberry, there are default services. You'll get a .mac address and sign into itunes, on blackberry there is that somewhat useless messenger, and I think a few other things. 
On the phone, google can be the connection to your contacts, they'll own search, push their voice and look-up services, etc. etc. Lots of things they can do on the phone, and there are some interesting and unexpected business models that come from that. 
I recently read that google-4-1-1 is using the huge number of calls for voice recognition technology (understanding speech, not keying in on a specific persons voice). They need the voices in order to improve the technology, and then they can license that tech. I believe that came from the book 'what would google do'.",1247880997

That is to say, I respect my mind incredibly, but I don't have any belief that says my mind was built the way it was for a reason, or that there's something wrong with experimenting with it. That doesn't mean I abuse it incredibly, but I'm fine with drugs and find the infrequent experiences I have with them to be worth the negligible cost they have on my mind.<p>I won't say ""drugs are good"" because I think it's stupid to assign a moral value to drugs either way. Hence, the idea that the brain should be preserved and altering chemicals avoided isn't one that I find offensive in the least. But it's worth pointing out the beneficial effects they can have on you. For one thing, realizing the limits of your perception can be fascinating. Weed doesn't have that effect on me so much, but alcohol and salvia both certainly made me realize things I wouldn't have realized otherwise. Alcohol's emotional effects certainly taught me that our moods are tenuous and that we shouldn't equate our emotional states to any sort of logical truth about the world.<p>Regarding weed and dulled intelligence - yes, I feel like that sometimes. I feel like that without using weed. Right now I'm in an emotive state where I feel like I'm going to grow fat and die without ever moving. Weed has nothing to do with those downer feelings. Since I first took weed, though, last February, I wrote a novel, designed a handful of web sites that I'm proud of, finished a few projects, etc., and I did it in between infrequent weed hits. It's worth pointing out that many great artists were users - Miles Davis and heroin most famously - and that using drugs doesn't instantly make you less creative. It might make you creative in a <i>different</i> way, but creativity is not something which can be gained and lost. It is a potential that we all have regardless of intelligence. Think of it more as a muscle than as a trait.<p>We're affected by chemicals no matter how we live. You live your life according to a mixture of fats, proteins, carbohydrates, and nutrients. In my mind, worrying too much about weed is like worrying about eating fats - it's certainly possible that if you take too much, there'll be adverse effects, but assuming that a single contact with a substance will change you forever is silly.<p>Regarding the <i>initial</i> question, though, hacking on weed probably won't work too well. Weed affects the sort of focus you'd need. (For certain other activities, however, like playing music, weed can help. It's not a black-and-white all-or-nothing deal.)<p>My advice would be to try it, since you can't really be hurt trying, but if you decide not to then all power to you.",1247880062

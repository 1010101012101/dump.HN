6461185,comment,6461076,6461076,1,0,jjoonathan,,,"Great concept, great execution. A lovely parody! Definitely earned my clickthrough.<p>Here are the details of the law they are pushing for: <a href=""http://anticorruptionact.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://anticorruptionact.org/</a><p>I&#x27;m very happy to know that campaign finance is getting this sort of attention. I&#x27;ve always been incredulous that in our system, bribery isn&#x27;t just <i>legal</i>, it&#x27;s literally <i>mandatory</i> -- you can&#x27;t get elected if you&#x27;re too clean to accept shady campaign contributions.<p>I <i>love</i> the $100 tax-rebate-for-campaign-contributions idea. I have long thought that we needed to publicly fund campaigns but despaired at the power of entrenched interests: existing campaign finance reform laws came with loopholes that ultimately revealed them as PR stunts rather than legitimate efforts to curb bribery. The tax rebate is exciting because it sneaks a backdoor into what would appear to be another bogus reform law.<p>&quot;Naming and shaming&quot; lobbyists, muzzling the latest contribution-funneling-device-du-jour, and calling for more regular rule enforcement aren&#x27;t strategies that strike me as particularly promising, since they simply call for more of what we&#x27;re already doing (if x gets us nothing, no reason to expect 2x will get us more). But they serve as the perfect vehicle to deliver #7, the tax rebate, which silently activates once public interest reaches a certain threshold (enough to outspend current election financiers) and gives the bill teeth. A brilliant design!<p>I really hope this works. I doubt it will, but I really, really want to be wrong.",1380351562

6461172,comment,6461076,6461147,6,0,Amadou,,,"I really like Lawrence Lessig&#x27;s proposal.  It is a &quot;hack&quot; of the Citizen&#x27;s United ruling along the lines of how copyleft is a hack of copyright law.<p>In essence, he proposes that all campaign donations go into a &quot;black box&quot; and are secretly reversible.  So you can write a check to your politician&#x27;s PAC, hand it directly to him but he must deposit the funds into the black box.  Then you can secretly get some or all of your money back - the politician can&#x27;t tell who reneged on their donation.<p>Lessig&#x27;s approach does not in any way restrict how much you can give to a politician - there is no &quot;censorship&quot; in mandating that political donations go into a black box - the campaign can still see that you made the donation - they still &quot;hear&quot; your speech. Nor are you forced to keep it a secret if you reneg, you are free to tell the politician you took back your money if you really want him to know that.<p>Reportedly something like the above was tried on a small scale, an election for Miami or south Florida, judges.  Apparently the result was that all of the campaigns netted exactly zero dollars in donations when all was said and done.",1380350980

You know what the DAG is, right? I don&#x27;t want to exclude all merge commits when looking at the DAG. I merely don&#x27;t want to see all of your &quot;merged master into master&quot; bubbles because you can&#x27;t be bothered to clean up a bit and rebase before pushing your changes.<p>I don&#x27;t know what you&#x27;re going on about with this &quot;destroying history&quot; as if the sequence of your little typo mistakes are some kind of precious documentary that needs to be preserved in case some forensic expert wants to trace every step you made along the process of adding a widget. You might as well go find a system that records and tracks every key you type, because after all, every time you hit the backspace key, you are <i>destroying history</i>.<p>Tags do not keep alternate histories. They are simply labels on commits. You use them to mark certain commits as releases, you do not use them to track every logical change to the codebase. They are used sparingly to track the occasional version number bump as a result of a sufficiently large number of changes. These version tags do not provide the granularity I need when I look to see what is happening on a single branch at any point in time. To add them to every non-trivial commit as a way of distinguishing them from the just-dicking-around commits would be ludicrous.<p>edit: One more thing. I think it is absolutely silly to say in one comment &quot;stop committing non-workable intermediate stuff and finish what you&#x27;re doing before committing&quot; and then turn around in another comment and talk about how rebase has a &quot;nasty side-effect of destroying history&quot;. You do realize that all the editing and polishing you&#x27;re doing before you make your commit is the same type of <i>destroying history</i> that would happen if you made small, incremental commits and then cleaned them up with rebase, right? The only difference is that your way is <i>way more</i> dangerous as far as losing history is concerned, and you&#x27;re not taking advantage of any of the benefits of Git in the process.",1380350949

6461130,comment,6457868,6461051,3,0,robomartin,,,"> experience with regular expressions seems to indicate that terse and complex DSLs are resented for their lack of maintainability<p>The problem with regular expressions is the &quot;regular expressions gone wild&quot; effect.  Also, the lack of a mechanism for documenting intent is a serious hindrance.  One such example are the various forms of email validity regex strings floating around out there.<p>I&#x27;ll also say that there&#x27;s somewhat of a lack of &quot;topology&quot; with regex expressions.  What I mean is probably best explained with an analog.  If you look at a page full of cleanly written mathematical notation you will quickly identify what I am calling a &quot;topology&quot; of sorts.  You&#x27;ll see the equal sign creating a demarcation between sides.  You might see integral signs providing further grouping.  The same is true of division lines, parenthesis, exponents and radicals.<p>Now, a page full of equations can be insanely opaque.  Alone they mean very little to most people.  However, properly inserted comments and guidance can take something that was impenetrable and turn it into a more approachable problem.  Of course, all of it assumes that you know both the notation and the mathematics behind it.  Hard to understand differential equations if you never studied them.<p>A language like APL can be very similar to this.  I can write an ugly impenetrable hunk of code in one line and good luck figuring out what it does.  On that point you are absolutely correct.<p>If one starts to work with APL on a daily basis one invariably develops &quot;idioms&quot; --short chunks of reusable code-- that are applied with some regularity.  Perhaps the most famous library of APL idioms is the Finn APL Idiom Library [0].<p>Here you have a set of expressions that do very useful stuff that can be plugged into any program.  Generally speaking, a good programmer would include a comment identifying the idiom any time it is used.  These little chunks of code, again, if APL is your daily 8 to 12 hour focus, become like words that you use in your code.  You learn to recognize them very quickly.<p>Unlike regex, the symbols in APL, similarly to the mathematical example I gave above, create a topology of sorts that helps you read and understand the code.  The programmer has to be sensitive to the fact that, very much like regex, APL can easily become impenetrable, particularly to the casual observer.  It is important to recognize this and both format and comment code appropriately.<p>My general rule for programming, regardless of the language I use, is that I need to leave myself enough information, breadcrumbs and documentation to be able to understand what I was doing after five years of not having looked at the code or used the language it was written with.  This approach has saved my butt multiple times to the point that I can say, at least to my satisfaction, that it is the only way to create code --regardless of language-- that can survive the test of time and is easy to maintain.<p>The short answer to your observation, then, is that a good programmer should easily eliminate the impenetrability issues the language might have.<p>[0] <a href=""http://aplwiki.com/FinnAplIdiomLibrary"" rel=""nofollow"">http://aplwiki.com/FinnAplIdiomLibrary</a>",1380349492

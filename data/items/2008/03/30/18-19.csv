Looks like they have pretty good historical data, so you could at least estimate what level of credit enhancement you'd need to get a good rating on each tranche.  Given what the loss curves look like, you could probably do pretty well selling front sequential pieces.  (Look on Wikipedia to learn more about sequentials, PACs, pass-throughs, NAS, and other CDO structures).  To fund the structure, you would borrow again on Prosper.com, and tell borrowers that funds would be repaid according to the structure you set up.  If you provided good enough documentation for your structure and your model, you could probably get a rate significantly lower than the rate on the loans you bought.<p>You could also sell credit default swaps on the individual loans... and then aggregate the CDS into a synthetic CDO...",1206903437
150334,comment,149052,149126,0,0,aflag,,,"I don't think perspective is that much relevant. If someone says ""This restaurant is the best in town"", it means that of all the other restaurants the person tried, that one is the one he likes best. You don't need to be an expert to have opinions and feelings toward things. If you don't agree that restaurant is the best you can provide info why you think the statement ""this restaurant is the best in town"" is wrong.<p>The second person perspective is just a suggestion. Of course you're free not to go there if you don't want to.<p>Finally, the first person perspective is just one other way to put things. In this case it's more verbose and, before the second phrase, don't even give you as much information as the god's perspective (in god's perspective you know this restaurant is the one the person likes the most, in 1st person perspective you just knows this person likes it). Saying ""This restaurant is the best in town. Cooking is great and it's very welcoming."" gives you at least the same information as the 1st-person perspective.<p>I'm saying all that because I hate see people trying to debunk an argument by picking on the guy's perspective. Stuff like ""you can't state that as an absolute truth"", just because you said something like ""this restaurant is the best in town"". If you have information that may change that opinion, please give us, otherwise, don't flood the comments with ""you don't know that much"". That's about the same as DH2.",1206903431

It might not be possible to address that effectively here, but let me try.<p>Let's call a particular run of the Turing test a ""Turing dialog"". Say a Turing dialog D consists of alternating statements C1,H1,...,Cn,Hn where C stands for ""computer"" and H for ""human"". Say a ""successful Turing dialog"" is one that succeeds in fooling the human participant - that is, Hn is something like ""I think you're human"".<p>You're right that for any Turing dialog D, D is finite and therefore an algorithm exists to reproduce it (a simple lookup table will do). But such an algorithm is only good for one specific D. To build it, you'd have to know all of D in advance.<p>To pass the Turing test, we need more. We need an algorithm, which, given <i>any valid prefix</i> of a Turing dialog, i.e. any sequence C1,H1,...,Ck,Hk, knows how to produce Ck+1 in such a way that the dialog will end successfully. That's not the same thing, is it?",1206903331

If I find a link, I'll post it.<p>Anyway, they interviewed a number of foreign born founders, and the consensus was that it took so much risk to move to another country as an immigrant, the risk of founding a startup really seemed small in comparison.<p>Having grown up in Central America in the 80's myself, I'd also postulate that you're able to think outside the box a bit better as well.  Why?  Because to the immigrant, everything in a new country is so profoundly different to begin with, that you barely see the boxes that so many other native-born people are hung up on.",1206903140

During the first two years, the students get a fairly classical CS program with a slightly higher component of software development projects than is common.

150317,comment,149482,149982,0,0,rmk,,,"My personal experience has been that I am much more productive when programming in python.  More gets done easily, and the code is very readable.<p>However, I realised this only after I had spent order of magnitude more time on doing the same thing in C, and burnt myself plenty of times during the process. My point is that you find out how productive you can be in one language when you have used another language to do the same thing - then a comparison becomes somewhat meaningful. I had <i>read</i> a lot about how python makes you more productive, but I <i>experienced</i> it only when I started coding in python to achieve tasks that I used to code in C earlier.<p>The same goes for shell scripts that make my life easier. Shell scripting became a hellish experience when I was using a solaris machine for some time - but by writing a python script instead of a shell script, I could be pretty sure that it would run in linux / solaris / any other *nix.<p>So, I still believe that we are essentially in agreement regarding productivity.  Efficiency is another matter though - inspite of psyco etc, python tends to be slower in some tasks and it might be well worth the time to code them in C.",1206902661

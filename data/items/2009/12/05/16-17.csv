They didn't need 10,000 hours to come up with a great song, an expert quality song. I bet many had only written 20-30 songs before getting famous, certainly nowhere near 10,000 hours of song writing. You even get bands which then fall into mediocrity after a fantastic debut.<p>I have no doubt they put in hours beforehand, but they've been at school, certainly not playing for 3 hours a day for 10 years.<p>Not only that they have some mastery of the instruments, song writing, stage charisma, all distinct skills. Many great guitarists write crap songs.<p>So where did they get the 30 years to get all 3 skills?<p>I think the Beatles example is bad because they had an extra skill, the ability to morph their music with the times that many other bands don't (Bowie is another example of someone who was able to do this). They are eternal because they constantly changed, put out great albums, which has nothing to do with the 10,000 hours of practice they put in in Germany.",1260031829

I.e., the lab report should say: ""Whatever your prior estimate of P(sick) is, your posterior should now be P(sick)/(0.01 P(not sick) + P(sick))"" instead of saying ""the patient has an x% chance of being sick"".<p>Suppose before the test I believe the odds the patient is sick are 1% and you think they are 10%. Once the test comes out positive, I've updated my probability estimate to 50%, you to 92%.<p>The update rule provided by Bayesian statistics is objective, even if the posterior is subjective.

978211,comment,978124,978124,0,0,btilly,,,"The real problem with statistics is that people want an answer to an impossible problem.  Namely they want to be told the probability of the world being a particular way.  But anyone familiar with conditional probability can easily see that there is no way to come up with that answer, because the conditional probability of something <i>after</i> an observation depends on the assumed probability <i>before</i> the observation.<p>There are multiple approaches to this problem.  What frequentist statistics does is answers a <i>different</i> question.  Namely, ""What is the probability of getting a result this strongly against the null hypothesis if the null hypothesis is true.""  This is appealing in that it is an objective probability that seems to say something about the problem under discussion. However people consistently read it as, ""What is the probability that the null hypothesis is true?""  Which is simply wrong.<p>There is a second problem with frequentist statistics, which is what this article is about.  Which is that the objective-looking probability you get depends on the null hypothesis chosen in ways it shouldn't.  Basic familiarity with Bayes' Theorem and conditional probability demonstrates that it is impossible for it to matter whether your intention was to flip a coin 6 times, flip it until you get both heads and tails, or flip it until you get heads.  This factor cannot affect the conditional probability of the coin being biased.  But those three different intentions translate into 3 different calculations, and 3 different answers in frequentist statistics.<p>So that's the frequentist approach.  What is the Bayesian approach?  It is to come up with statistics that inform us on how prior beliefs before observation turn into posterior beliefs after observation.  The advantage of this method is that it is intellectually honest.  The disadvantages are that it is complicated and people notice that it is confusing.  (The frequentist approach is confusing as well, but people don't notice their confusion.  Instead the confidently draw the wrong conclusion that the null hypothesis has been proven.)<p>There are other approaches.  The article touched on my favorite when it pointed out that we should report likelyhood ratios rather than probabilities.  This is absolutely right.  The effect of an observation is to modify our prior beliefs, and likelyhood ratios concisely describe how we should modify them.  Plus they have the great ability to stack - you can take 3 experiments and combine their likelyhood ratios to come up with the likelyhood ratio for having seen all three experiments.<p>Unfortunately, though, everyone knows frequentist methods, people accept them, and it is very hard to get people to see what is wrong with them.  So alternate approaches, though theoretically superior, face an uphill battle towards acceptance.",1260031067

978179,comment,977371,977371,0,0,dmuino,,,"This is not the thing to test. DNS resolution time is important, but even if the google resolver returned results faster than your local ISP resolver it would still make your browsing in the general case slower. The problem is that the IPs for the resolvers have presence in very few locations around the world. I believe this number is just three at this time (Virginia, London, Taiwan). The big problem with this is the effect it has on CDNs and GSLBs. The DNS response you get for large sites, like www.bing.com for example, depends on the location of the machine asking the question. If you use your local ISP as your resolver then you'll get an answer that's close to you. If you use the google resolver you'll get an answer that's close to the google resolver and that will generate additional latency for all the rest of the browsing session. This obviously will affect all big sites that are NOT google. They're obviously aware of the problem since they have special cases for their own sites. If you have access to machines in different countries you can see the responses you get from 8.8.8.8 have good locality properties for google sites. So I'm guessing they're just forwarding the queries to their location-aware DNS servers.

I don't see how you can make a case that this is an improvement in general.",1260030056

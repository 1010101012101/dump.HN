Naively you could search a global index and then filter results down to your friends, but that filter seems impossibly slow. Alternatively you could maintain a separate index per person, but querying 500 indexes seems unreasonable.<p>Maybe they partition the graph into cliques which they index, search and then fix up with a second pass to add and remove noncliqued friends?",1419861577

8809746,comment,8809215,8809520,0,0,klibertp,,,"Actually it&#x27;s <i>being hyped</i> that&#x27;s weird. There are literally dozens of very interesting languages being created and developed <i>right now</i> and I bet you don&#x27;t know of any of them. The only - and they are very few in comparison - languages which are being hyped since very early in their life cycle are the ones backed by corporations. Both Rust and Go are such languages and that&#x27;s basically it.<p>&quot;Normal&quot; languages live on a different time scale: it takes many years to gather enough users to even have a chance of generating a bit of hype. For most languages that moment never comes: they are good, solid languages with <i>decades</i> of development behind them and completely obscure and unknown. Others become well-known in certain areas while still being unfamiliar for the &quot;general public&quot;.<p>Take a look at Haxe, Opa, Elixir, Cobra or Io for example. They are all very interesting (each for its own reasons), mature and productive - and completely unknown. Out of those only Elixir gets mentioned here sometimes.<p>Anyway, a choice of language should never be based on &quot;hype&quot; alone. Of course, language popularity is an important factor, but most often limiting yourself to popular languages is a case of premature optimization: it&#x27;s quite likely that in your project the language popularity won&#x27;t make a difference (especially in small/short-lived projects) and that &quot;raw&quot; language features are more important than hype. (Of course that&#x27;s not always the case: bigger or long-lived projects benefit from language popularity very much, for example by having easier time finding replacements for developers who went away and so on)",1419861283

8809735,comment,8809084,8809531,0,0,dschiptsov,,,"Why there are so many ignorant idiots in the world?<p>According to Alan Kay, the essence of OO approach (or paradigm if you wish) is a synthesis of a few fundamental concepts (like a Lisp itself) where <i>not a single one can                                                                                                                                                                                                                be removed</i> because harmony (or balance) would be destroyed, and an ugly, mediocre construction would emerge instead (Java).<p>The concepts are:<p>* First-class closures - isolated, share-nothing abstractions.<p>* Nesting of closures, so they could have an internal structure.<p>* Message passing as <i>the only way of communication</i> among closures.<p>As long as you follow these three principles, you have &quot;generics&quot; for free, because all the operations are mere messages.<p>These are three of four principles upon which Smalltalk has been built upon.<p>Here is an illustration, assuming that we are implementing message passing as simple as a procedures call.<p><pre><code>   (define (kons x y)
      (lambda (m)
        (cond ((eq? m &#x27;car) x)
              ((eq? m &#x27;cdr) y)
              (else (error &quot;bottom!&quot;)))))

   (define (kar x)
      (x &#x27;car))

   (define (kdr x)
      (x &#x27;cdr))
</code></pre>
Notice that using only these abstractions we could implement a unified list structure of Lisps (recall Escher&#x27;s hands).<p>This is (surprise!) the &quot;core&quot; of Erlang - extending of closure-based language with immutable data with explicit  message-passing, to create first-class <i>agents</i> (servers, etc).<p>Where is inheritance? Inheritance is just a <i>protocol</i> which specifies what to do with unknown message instead of signaling an error or returning a bottom like in Haskell.<p>What is MOP could be found in Wikipedia. Smalltalk was its ancestor.<p>What is CLOS? It is a DSL embedded in a Lisp (based on structures made out of closures) which implements some or other subset of MOP. MIT Scheme, for example, has SOS.<p>So FP meet OP in CLOS.",1419861085

Our troops now also wear really serious body armor, a lot of Kevlar designed to stop fragments and 9 mm bullets, plus at least 2 rifle plates, front and back.

8809720,comment,8808427,8808427,0,0,hga,,,"Let&#x27;s me echo just about everything the author is saying:<p>In theory and practice, the Stoner direct impingement system where gas is vented directly into the receiver requires <i>vastly</i> more maintenance than piston based designs.  To my knowledge, <i>no one</i> who isn&#x27;t accepting large numbers of donated M16s uses this design in their service rifle, with Canada an obvious exception to the rule.  <i>Absolutely no one</i>.<p>It has two advantages that I&#x27;m aware of: the front of the rifle is lighter in weight, and has better inherent accuracy since nothing in the front is moving.  However the Swiss, who care <i>infinitely</i> more than the US <i>Army</i> about marksmanship, didn&#x27;t find the latter to be an issue when they developed their own 5.56 NATO rifle.  (The Marines still care about marksmanship, but don&#x27;t have any choice in their service rifle, except in rejecting the M4 and sticking to the 20 inch barreled M16).<p>5.56 NATO is a lousy round for stopping people, although the exact details were not elucidated until Martin Fackler did the research in the &#x27;80s.  At low velocity, all things being equal the round just travels straight through, doing one flip to exit backwards (what happens when a bullet changes media like this).  If the velocity is high enough, the round breaks at its cannelure (a crimped indentation that mates with the end of the cartridges brass to keep the bullet in place during rough handling and firing of other rounds), creating two pieces.  At higher velocities, the back end will fragment.  As a rule of thumb, for every inch chopped off the barrel, you loose ~50 yards of effective range due to this mechanism.  Which causes one to wonder why the Army switched to the M4, sacrificing ~275.<p>The answer I see to that is the total, and I mean total, corruption of this part of US Army procurement in the post-WWII era.  The Army did OK with the 1903/6 Springfield bolt action rifle (a copy of the 1898 Mauser), and superbly with the M1 Garand semi-auto rifle for WWII and Korea.  But after that the procurement process was totally corrupt, as in samples of other designs were physically sabotaged so the M14 could be adopted.  It&#x27;s a Garand with a better gas system and a detachable box magazine, both good improvements, but outside of a good trigger pull it&#x27;s probably the worst design adopted in that era because it leaves so much of the action unprotected from the elements.<p>The situation was so bad the Robert Strange McNamara&#x27;s DoD of Vietnam infamy forced the AR-15 onto the Army, which as mentioned in the article totally screwed up the procurement of it (and one is allowed to suspect sabotaged it by e.g. not properly supporting the cleaning of the rifle).  As the author mentioned, a lot of good men died in Vietnam due to unreliable M16s, which, I&#x27;ll agree with the others, has been kludged to a barely acceptable state.  But again, I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s the worst of the currently issued rifles, except perhaps for the Heckler & Koch G36, a rifle that&#x27;s infamously issued to armies that don&#x27;t actually it in war.<p>Continuing with the procurement corruption, what prompted the move to the M4?  Uncharitable people like me believe it&#x27;s likely the fact that Colt lost the M16 contract to Fabrique Nationale d&#x27;Herstal (National Factory of Herstal, Belgium), which despite its name and origin has had a tight relationship with Americans and America since at least the &#x27;30s.  So Colt came up with the propitiatory M4 and lo and behold, the Army switched to it.<p>Except now Colt has also lost that contract to FNH, and their factory in South Carolina is even more busy (they also at last count provided all the barrels for our machine guns, plus manufacture Winchester and Browning guns; in history, John Moses Browning (PBUH) first worked with Winchester before moving mostly to working with FNH).",1419860765

Or the hypothermia will make you stupid, and then everyone will wonder why the heck a smart guy was walking along the cliff edge etc.  Sweating in the cold is very dangerous.

It attempts to decompose the world in terms of interfaces that vary on a single type. To deal with the real problems you need multisorted algebras - families of interfaces that span multiple types. I find OOP philosophically unsound. It claims that everything is an object. Even if it is true it is not very interesting - saying that everything is an object is saying nothing at all. I find OOP methodologically wrong. It starts with classes. It is as if mathematicians would start with axioms. You do not start with axioms - you start with proofs. Only when you have found a bunch of related proofs, can you come up with axioms. You end with axioms. The same thing is true in programming: you have to start with interesting algorithms. Only when you understand them well, can you come up with an interface that will let them work.&quot;<p>More discussion:<p><a href=""http://www.quora.com/Was-object-oriented-programming-a-failure"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.quora.com/Was-object-oriented-programming-a-failu...</a>",1419859438

These offer some benefits of type systems and module systems (AKA existential type systems). Any time we want to restrict access to some value, we can &quot;seal&quot; it by generating a new symbol and using that as its key in an object/mapping. We can pass the symbol to the code we want to &quot;unseal&quot; it, whilst the object itself can get passed around anywhere at all, without anyone being able to extract or replace the value until it reaches the &quot;unsealer&quot;.<p>To see why this would be useful for &quot;private visibility&quot;, the trick is not that we&#x27;re hiding the values to everyone outside our lexical scope (which is trivial, since that&#x27;s what lexical scope <i>is</i>); it&#x27;s that we can <i>allow</i> access to these values, via functions which check that they&#x27;re given the correct symbol. In other words, we can have our code &quot;recognise&quot; when some other code should be given access. If we limit ourselves to making &quot;classes&quot;, where the symbol is in-scope in the &quot;constructor&quot; and doesn&#x27;t leak out, then we have a primitive form of type-checking; if we&#x27;re given the correct symbol, the other code must be of the same &quot;class&quot;, so we might decide to let it see our &quot;privates&quot;.<p>Of course, that&#x27;s just a degenerate edge-case.

8809574,comment,8803101,8806859,0,0,btilly,,,"<i>So what&#x27;s constructivism useful for anyway?</i><p>Not much.  The philosophy of math is not noted for being particularly useful. :-)<p>That said, historically constructivism arose during a period when math was having trouble creating solid foundations.  Today we can talk about &quot;the reasonable existing logics&quot;.  But a century ago you couldn&#x27;t.  Attempts to create such a thing had repeatedly resulted in paradoxes, and an inability to find solid foundations had caused repeated mathematical crises for a century.<p>In that light, it was reasonable to doubt lines of reasoning that proved the existence of things in infinite sets but provided no way to actually find them.  This smelled too much of the kinds of things that had lead to paradox.<p>Hence the appeal of a philosophy that insisted that things are only known to exist when we have constructions for them.  Proofs are only valid when they follow lines of reasoning that can, at least in principle, actually be followed in finite time.<p>These days this is mostly a historical footnote.  But an important one.<p><i>There are also cases of interest beyond constructivism: what if a number is non-constructible but can be approximated?</i><p>Um, actually a constructivist would say that that number exists.<p>To understand, you have to ask what a real number is.  One definition of a real number is a Cauchy sequence of rational numbers.  Which is to say an infinite series of rational numbers that converges.  Constructivists make this more precise.  Rather than talking about an infinite series of rational numbers, they talk about a algorithm that generates a series of rational numbers.  Rather than saying &quot;for every epsilon greater than 0 there exists an N...&quot; they insist that there is an algorithm which can take in epsilon and spit out N.  Combining these two, from a valid specification of a real number, you can generate an algorithm that given an epsilon > 0 can generate a rational number within epsilon of the real number.  And an algorithm that does that can easily be turned into a Cauchy sequence.<p>Thus to a constructivist, being able to approximate a number arbitrarily well is perfectly fine as a definition of said number.  Things get odd in that you can have two different constructions of real numbers but you don&#x27;t always know whether they are specifying the same number.  But you quickly get used to this.<p><i>Saying it doesn&#x27;t exist doesn&#x27;t sound particularly useful.</i><p>Let me turn that around.<p>What is the use of asserting the existence of things that you cannot construct?  What are you going to do with something that you cannot find in an infinite haystack?  A thing that may be impossible to find, even in principle?",1419858276

8809571,comment,8798800,8807655,0,0,hga,,,"There are certainly more aspects, but my point remains, there is no &quot;true police state&quot; where subjects are allowed to keep and bear arms like our&#x27;s does.  (Well, there&#x27;s exceptions like NYC and D.C. that perhaps prove the rule.)  In fact, we RKBA activists know that the history of police states always includes an early period where guns are systematically confiscated from the people.  I know for example the basic stories for Nazi Germany, China, Japan (1588!) and Cuba off the top of my head.<p>As for your latter point, you&#x27;re assuming two things: someone wanting revenge on the police/government for something unforgivable is going to give a damn about that, and that if things got nasty, the citizens would play by the &quot;rules of war&quot; of the police.  Not to mention numbers, we would utterly swamp them if it came down to something like that.

I can&#x27;t remember), these debts were likely recalculated. It&#x27;s not like the Bank of England is still issuing XVIII-century Pound Sterling just to pay interest on something.<p>One thing the United Kingdom of Great Britain really excels at, is continuity of government. It would be much more difficult for, say, Germany or France to deal with debts from 1720, considering they went through several revolutions and dissolutions and likely defaulted or simply ignored previous obligations at various points.",1419858194

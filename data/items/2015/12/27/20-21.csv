Copyright covers any type of creative work, and is going to become more and more important as the world switches from work that is primarily dominated by physical labor to one where one&#x27;s creative work is how they are compensated.  Software developers can&#x27;t keep popping out new versions of software every week, and authors can&#x27;t write an entire book each week, so there is an economic requirement that they be able to amortize the costs of their labor.  The only way to do that is to allow the developer to dictate the terms of the sale and artificially restrict access to only those that agree to the terms.  Perhaps Kickstarter or others will change this and we won&#x27;t need copyright anymore, but right now it doesn&#x27;t just protect the rights of large distributors, but also the rights of millions of independent creators that rely on such laws to ensure that they are compensated for their work, and to prevent bigger, more established players, from stealing their work.",1451249550

10798722,comment,10795379,10795379,0,0,graeham,,,"The article is calling for a &quot;sell low&quot; strategy [0]. The author is mistaking low oil prices as from lack of demand. This is part of the story, but a small part. The major factor is high supply, mainly from Saudi Arabia [1]. The motive is not entirely clear. Most think its a fight for market share, with Saudi hoping Russia, Venezuela, US fracking, Canadian oil sands, or other middle east players blinking before the Saudi&#x27;s.<p>They are probably right, that other players have high expenses, less cash on hand, and will have to fold first. Certainly US shale is hurting, and practically no new oil sand projects are starting in Canada. In fact, this probably signals a good time to <i>buy</i> new assets, for companies prepare for this.<p>What I think Saudi/ OPEC is missing from the equation is that market share is not something that can be won long-term. US shale may have to cut back this year, but I think the time scale to turn production back on is about one year once prices return. Oil sands are a longer-term investment, but this also means that low prices don&#x27;t cut production - the expensive investment has already been made.<p>Another major thing the article is missing from the equation is the demand side. Decrease in demand at the moment has come from efficiency investments that were economically driven by high oil prices. People bought smaller cars, took fewer road trips, and invested in home insulation. With oil prices lower, many of these things become less economical. Demand will increase, prices will go up.<p>[0] - <a href=""http://www.nasdaq.com/markets/crude-oil-brent.aspx?timeframe=10y"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nasdaq.com/markets/crude-oil-brent.aspx?timeframe...</a> \n[1] - <a href=""http://uk.businessinsider.com/saudi-arabia-has-no-plans-to-cut-oil-production-2015-11"" rel=""nofollow"">http://uk.businessinsider.com/saudi-arabia-has-no-plans-to-c...</a>",1451249455

As another comment noted, in many settled places in the United States there are so many outdoor electric lights that it is hard to get a good view of the night sky, but some of the brightest stars are visible even where I live, where yard lights abound. (My bigger problem with viewing the sky is cloud cover at many times of the year.) I live at the 45th parallel of north latitude, so the pole star (Polaris), which I can easily find from the pointer stars on the Big Dipper[1], provides a convenient guide to which way is north, at a halfway-up angle from the horizon. In winter, the seasonal constellation Orion[2] is very distinctive, and depending on the exact date in the season and the time of the day is a reasonably good guide to which way is south.<p>I once used Orion to navigate my way across an unfamiliar town when I took the wrong bus to an evening appointment and found out that the last bus stop on the line still left me with a two-mile walk to where I needed to go. These days I usually drive to evening appointments in the winter, but the stars are still a good guide which way I am driving on twisting exurban roads. Winter is better for seeing stars here both because the hours of darkness are longer and because the air is drier in winter (especially on cold nights) and there is less cloud cover hiding the stars from seeing.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.fortworthastro.com/beginner2.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.fortworthastro.com/beginner2.html</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.space.com/16659-constellation-orion.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.space.com/16659-constellation-orion.html</a>",1451249368

The members all gain by limiting sale volume, but each member has an incentive to cheat and overproduce their quota.  Historically, Saudi Arabia has underproduced to make up for the cheating and to hold the price line, but it sounds like they got fed up with doing that, and decided to show the other OPEC countries what life without OPEC would be like.<p>In regards to the competitors you mentions, you really have to split them into two groups: auto fuel and electric power generation.<p>OPEC really has no effect on electric power generation, mostly because no one burns oil for electricity.  The main hydrocarbons people burn are coal and natural gas, and they&#x27;re already really cheap.<p>It may be that Saudi Arabia wants to harm the shale-oil businesses, particularly the debt financed ones.

The constitution doesn&#x27;t mean shit (I wanted to add &quot;anymore&quot;, but from reading history, I&#x27;m not convinced it ever meant shit). That&#x27;s just reality. It only means something when people in power want it to mean something. And yes, it&#x27;s incredibly ironic that this is the exact system we had a revolution to get away from. Maybe not so much when you consider that a revolution is a 360 degree rotation that ends up in the exact same place.

10798614,comment,10795379,10795379,0,0,jofer,,,"Whoever wrote this seems to be predicting the present while having no awareness of how the petroleum industry works.  Yes, they&#x27;ve outlined what most majors are doing to different degrees in different areas.  However, you&#x27;re stupid not to keep your ability to operate when oil prices come back up. (Caveat: I&#x27;m an exploration geologist at a &quot;western major&quot;, so I do have a somewhat slanted view.)<p>First off, let&#x27;s get something out of the way.  The current price environment is every bit as artificially low as $120/bbl oil was artificially high.  Saudi Arabia is deliberately producing at very high rates to keep their market share and drive companies that can&#x27;t operate at $40/bbl out of business.  They want to be able to maintain their control over global oil markets in the future, and they&#x27;re in a geologically unique position of having huge reserves that can be produced at high rates and are economic at very low oil prices.  Therefore, they&#x27;ve flexed their muscles with the knowledge that unconventionals can&#x27;t keep up.<p>Most majors are operating on the assumption that oil will be back in the ~$60/bbl range within two years.<p>This is reasonable for several reasons.<p>1) Unconventional oil production _will_ decrease significantly over the next year.  Unconventional wells have very rapid decline rates.<p>2) It&#x27;s not clear that Iran&#x27;s production coming onto the global markets can offset the decline in unconventional production.  Iran has huge reserves in what should be a relatively cheap operating environment, they they also have aging infrastructure.<p>3) Saudi Arabia is likely to drop production once US unconventional-focused companies are no longer a threat.<p>Next, yes, they&#x27;ve outlined a strategy that all of the majors are following, albeit to less of an extreme.  To be precise:<p>> For Western oil companies, the rational strategy will be to stop oil exploration and seek profits by providing equipment, geological knowhow, and new technologies such as hydraulic fracturing (“fracking”) to oil-producing countries. But their ultimate goal should be to sell their existing oil reserves as quickly as possible and distribute the resulting tsunami of cash to their shareholders until all of their low-cost oilfields run dry.<p>The first half is exactly what every major, non-national upstream oil company does.  We provide the know-how to 1) find, 2) develop infrastructure to produce, and 3) efficiently recover hydrocarbons  to countries who don&#x27;t have a national oil company with the know-how or capital to do it on their own.<p>Next, most of the equipment and services portion of that isn&#x27;t provided, developed, or controlled by oil companies.  It&#x27;s done by service companies (e.g. Halliburton, Schlumberger, etc).  The in-house knowledge oil companies have is mostly around geology and managing huge infrastructure projects. (I&#x27;m biased towards exploration and I&#x27;m dramatically oversimplifying there.)<p>Finally, yes, most companies are selling a lot of assets right now.  However, you only sell what you don&#x27;t think you can operate economically in the current price environment.  You&#x27;re typically selling it to someone who can operate it more efficiently or who has a different idea of the potential for enhancing reserves.  At any rate, finding a buyer for the stuff you&#x27;d want to sell most is difficult, and a lot of the rest is currently profitable.<p>&quot;Wasting money by seeking new reserves&quot; is just a silly statement.  If we don&#x27;t keep exploring, we&#x27;ll wind up in the same boat we were back in the early 00&#x27;s.  It takes decades to go from exploration to first production.  You cut back on major capital expenditures for exploration, but you don&#x27;t stop entirely.",1451247442

I loved being able to do more advanced math, because it was interesting and the teachers were really good at making it fun to be smart. For the 10 years after that I would end up 2 years ahead of the &quot;average&quot; curriculum. This was normal for advanced students. We took Algebra in 7th grade, Calculus in 11th grade. I was actually probably below-average in the range of students I was classed with. It sounds like a cliche but I didn&#x27;t really ever do homework, but got A&#x27;s on tests, so I would end up with B&#x27;s and C&#x27;s and since there were no grade requirements for advancement, my teachers always recommended me for the highest next level class because they actually interacted with me and didn&#x27;t just sign off on the grade percentage.<p>I have to imagine it was because my parents were very laid back, but I never felt pressure to do better than I was doing. Everyone goes to college where I live, so no one really worried about that.

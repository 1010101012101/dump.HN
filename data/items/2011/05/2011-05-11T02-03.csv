The way you put it, you make it sound like you can have it all in a compact, but that's just not the case. A bridge camera with a substantial zoom and large sensor size will be as about as big as a DSLR with a lens of similar capability. A compact point and shoot will either have a smaller sensor or a less capable optical zoom, and probably both. I have a fairly high end compact, albeit one from late 2009 (Canon S90), and it is nowhere near as capable as an entry-level DSLR in terms of focus speed, continuous shot rate, instant on etc.; and the S95 from late 2010 isn't much more capable (720 HD video, stereo mics and firmware update).",1305082229

2534935,comment,2534709,2534709,4,0,woodrow,,,"Text from the site:<p><i>At Google I/O today I have to admit it was comical when the presenter doing the WebGL track had to stop in the middle of his presentation because his laptop forcibly rebooted when Windows decided to apply a security update.  He even joked that maybe Microsoft did it on purpose.  But, who really believes Microsoft is still the biggest threat facing Google?</i><p><i>Google I/O 2010 was such an amazing event last year because of their focus, again, on developers.  I have always loved Google products because I believe that Google engineers believe in open standards first and the success of their company second, and I personally think this is a formula for success in the Internet world.  I feel safe developing on Google platforms because I dont think Google cares about locking developers into proprietary platforms and technologies, unlike the Microsoft-ish strategies of the yesteryear.  And, I still believe that.  I remember saying to friends last year that the Google I/O keynote was so amazing because it was the best developer conference I attended, and the keynotes catered to developers.  We saw live demonstrations proving via statistics that Android was growing fast and then proving via Javascript benchmarks that the technologies behind it were ahead of the competition (meaning Apple).  It was thrilling to watch and I came out feeling so energized about developing on Google platforms.</i><p><i>Not so this year.  The keynote presenters almost all read directly from the teleprompter, rarely attempting eye contact with the people in the audience.  This is forgivable, especially at a tech conference.  What is intolerable is we were subject to platitudes about how developers are so important and thanking us for giving us your most important resource, your time.  This felt insincere when they took that time to shove product launches for Google Music and Google Movies on us.  Are we really supposed to be excited about the opportunity to rent movies from Google in a way that looks no better than anything Amazon or iTunes has offered for years?  Google Music was slightly more interesting as a cloud sync solution, but they missed the most important point:  this is a developers conference.  There were no APIs to any of these services, and at the Android Roundtable there was at least one frustrated questioner (a developer of a music app on Android) who expressed strong concerns that there were no answers about how these services would be presented to application developers.  It was a huge miss for Google to come here and not have clarity on at least a API roadmap for these new features.</i><p><i>While the WebGL presenters laptop was rebooting, I decided to check out another track.  I walked up to Marissa Meyers talk on the Geo track and was told that out of respect for the speakers, no one would be permitted to enter after a track had started.  Has no one at Google ever heard of the Principle of Two Feet?  As I wandered aimlessly I saw Tim OReilly refused admission, and this has unfortunately been the most exciting thing I have seen (picture above).  I spent the rest of the afternoon in sessions, frustrated at times when the presenter was talking beneath us as developers, but feeling trapped that I could not leave.  Feeling trapped:  if Google does no longer care about us, are they going to resort to the same type of lock-in as Microsoft did, rather than what worked in the past, keeping us excited by new technologies?  Is this the state of things to come?  Has Google lost its connection with developers?  Is Googles worst enemy now only itself?  The first day at I/O 2011 was not encouraging.</i>",1305081839

2) 33% of which are weekly active users (have used our app in the past 7 days)
3) 66% of which are 3-day active users
4) 50% of which are 24-hour active users<p>So for every 100 downloads, we see an average of 8 users who use the app every day. Breakdown:<p>1) 75 new users [this seems pretty good to me as a fraction of downloads]

3) 16 of which are 3-day active users [seems ok]

    formValues = (function() {
        var _i, _len, _ref, _results;
        _ref = $('.input');
        _results = [];
        for (_i = 0, _len = _ref.length; _i < _len; _i++) {
            elem = _ref[_i];
            _results.push(elem.value);
        }
        return _results;
    })();

That's... needlessly <i>bad</i>, so to speak. That could be rewritten in a much more readable fashion, like so:<p><pre><code>    var formValues = (function(inputEls) {
        var results = [];
        inputEls.each(function() {
            results.push($(this).val());
        });
        return results;
    })($('.input'));
    </code></pre>
If CoffeeScript is generating the first block seen here, then I'd actually be concerned, but perhaps I care more about this than some. Either way, while...<p><pre><code>    formValues = (elem.value for elem in $('.input'))
</code></pre>
...is certainly nicer, I don't really think it's necessary to further bastardize the views held on Javascript syntax in general. The first block in this comment is, to put it bluntly, <i>utter shit</i>, and does nothing but continue the trend that ""oh god Javascript is horrible"".",1305080789

What I really dislike about this is the use of curly braces to denote two completely different things: an object literal, and a function. Functions are extraordinarily privileged entities in JavaScript; they're the only way of creating scope, and they also change the context (`this`). Object are just a bunch of key-value pairs.<p>So to me, JavaScript's semantics are much clearer through the lens of CoffeeScript semantics: Curly braces are only used for object literals, and functions are denoted by a distinct symbol followed by indentation, except in one-liners like the above.<p>The extra compilation can be annoying (through largely transparent thanks to tools like Barista and the upcoming Rails 3.1 integration), but for me, it's always felt worth it. Debugging is harder, true, but I write code with fewer bugs in the first place. On net, learning CoffeeScript has been both a pleasure and a productivity boost.",1305080715

Hell, I'd love a chance to run stats on that dataset and I don't even have any skin in the game.  Some things you could look for:<p>- Files with the names of known release crews hidden away in an ID3V1 comment somewhere;<p>- Files uploaded by multiple people with identical incorrect (misspelled arists/titles) or unique (rip logs, comments, ratings) metadata;<p>- Files with timestamps earlier than the title's official street date (assuming the dedicated upload client preserves those dates);<p>- Multiple uploads of files with bit-for-bit identical audio content that doesn't correspond exactly to any official digital release (like identical MP3 encodes of a non-perfect CD rip, or identical versions of anything sourced from vinyl or cassette -- like a lot of the stuff on boutigue MP3 blogs);<p>- Files with audio data identical to anything ever subject to an official takedown notice, or downloaded by the RIAA from BitTorrent, Usenet or a Megaupload-type file sharing site.<p>Any given release will only have been distributed in a handful of legitimate digital versions -- basically the CD release(s) and any licensed digital download services. Any file uploaded to an online music locker that doesn't match those legit sources will be suspect, and any of those files what are uploaded to Google in bit-for-bit identical versions by multiple people will be a huge red STOLEN flag.<p>I have very little illegally-downloaded music relative to the size of my entire collection, but I still wouldn't go anywhere near a service like this. The data extractable from the audio files people upload would significantly reduce the effort needed for the record companies to go after even small-time downloaders.

They clearly took much more pride in the app, and that's where they have true value. With the store they are just middlemen, and though perhaps they could add value by helping people find they books they'd most enjoy, they don't seem to be innovating there. In the end their eBooks are just Adobe DRM protected ePubs.<p>So monetizing the middlemen part won't work, but aren't there any number of ways to monetize the reading app part? I, for one, wouldn't mind a flow-based reader. I've bought eBooks from a few places now, but also hate the page-turning interface.<p>This comes across as a stunt to try to change the agency model for book selling. Good luck on that, though, because now you need to convince both Apple and all the publishers to give them 20% again. But why would they do that? Extra middlemen are not going to offer 20% of value in a digital distribution chain.",1305079225

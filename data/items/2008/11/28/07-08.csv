379182,comment,379111,379111,0,0,anon120,,,"I had offers in both SV and Boston and it was a tough choice.  I'm still not sure I made the right one.<p>While Boston is cheaper, it's not that much cheaper.  I think you'll probably do slightly better off depending on the offer you get. (I currently live and work in Mountain View)<p>Startup-wise Boston seemed pretty sparse compared to the Silicon Valley.  That was definitely part of my decision (not just where to work, but as you say, networking, conferences to go to, etc).<p>I still think little fish, big pond is the better way to go.  It gets frustrating otherwise and limits your growth.  Important team in a less known company also is much better for career and personal satisfaction.<p>I'll be honest, weather also greatly influenced my decision.  Also what's your move going to be like? Getting all my stuff across the country was yet another reason for me to stay in the SV.<p>I personally actually much prefer Boston city and the general vibe of Boston, but career-wise I decided SV was better.",1227858429

You made many correct statements.</i><p>A winnar is you, then, if you get new thoughts.  Thanks for prodding me to justify all this.  It's been fun.

I just disagree that it's reasonable to expect Jobs's perverse incentives to not impact journalists, or to not be suspicious of anyone that tight with them.<p>Any reporter given the sort of access he has is in a feedback loop where bias begets access which in turn begets bias. To pass it off as ""Apple just rocks and Pogue knows it"" is naive.",1227857137
379171,comment,379111,379111,0,0,iigs,,,"You'll find good jobs in either place. Do consider also the cultures of the two locations. I know granola west coasters that would not be able to hang with the east coast hustle, and I know east coasters that would be driven bananas by the happy go lucky California lifestyle. Which stereotype do you dislike less? You'll be interacting with these people when you're not at work and if one of these grates on your nerves it can easily build resentment and unhappiness toward your living arrangement.<p>Whichever you choose, make a concerted effort to try to learn from and appreciate the different social norms of your new home. I didn't do all that I could/should have once, and I regret it.",1227856956

They just followed their gut feeling about how to execute, and they did it with confidence. Maybe the confidence makes all the difference.",1227856769

379167,comment,379111,379161,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"As I mentioned, Mountain View is very nearly as expensive as San Francisco.  San Jose and Sunnyvale and Santa Clara and Redwood City are two or three hundred less, in general, for the same space.<p>The funny thing is how living out here in the valley warps your mind about real estate rental (and purchase) prices.  When I moved out here I was stunned that I'd be paying twice as much as my mortgage in Austin for less than two thirds the space.  Now that I'm out here, I see a place in SF going for $1675, and I think, ""Wow, I need to jump at that one!  Nah, probably already gone, at that price...why get myself worked up over nothing?""<p>I'm also probably shopping in somewhat nicer areas than is strictly necessary (in addition to shopping for a bigger place than someone right out of college is probably going to want).  I have a dog, and I tend to walk at all hours of the night...it's just a habit I've had for ten to fifteen years, and I think altering it would negatively impact my life, so I'm shopping only in pretty safe areas.  And, because my reason for moving to the city is to be nearer to live music, I'm shopping pretty centrally, as well.<p>You can get a small 1 bedroom place in the $1300 range in both SF and Mountain View.  But, that's probably the lower bound, without living in a really sketchy or far out location.  I guess that's a big part of the reason most YC founders live with roommates.  Splitting a $2700 place three ways works out to a pretty good deal.",1227856449

379162,comment,379111,379154,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"I had a long commute in Austin, and before that, in Houston.  I'll never do it again.  No amount of money can make up for the time lost, or the impact on mental well-being.  Now that I'm transitioning myself out of ""gotta work every waking minute"" startup mode, and into ""sustainable life that includes building a company, but also has time for friends and hobbies"", I've realized I'm spending an awful lot of time on the Caltrain going up to the city to meet up with friends and do things (the kind of thing I like to do is see and take part in great live music, comedy, theatre, etc. in small venues, and pretty much none of that happens in Mountain View).  Since I don't have an office to go to every day down here on the peninsula, it's kinda dumb for me to stay here.",1227855926

The Apple founders would be unable to get funding these days. They wouldn't even get a meeting.<p>VCs have set themselves up as executives (maybe more like record industry shot-callers than steel-company management) of the first postmodern corporation. If you don't take their terms, they can't exactly fire you, so they fund your competition. Tech press is a weird sort of HR organization, and so-called ""startup CEOs"" are merely product managers within this weird meta-corporation that is just as badly stacked against software talent as a 1970s steel company.<p>It's having pernicious effects on the software industry, which is now a hotbed of mediocrity utterly opposed to what it used to be.<p>I think what killed software entrepreneurialism for good was the rise in housing prices, coupled with the student debt epidemic and the cost of health insurance. Unless independently wealthy, no one can actually afford to ""bootstrap"" in these locations, so true entrepreneurial activity has been replaced by VC-istan careerism.<p>I don't know where the future is, but it's not in Silicon Valley now-- no place where middle-class houses cost $1.2 million is anywhere near the future-- and it's not in New York, and it may not be in the U.S. at all.<p>On a side note, I wish people would stop calling the VC ecosystem in the Bay Area, ""Silicon Valley"". That's why I use VC-istan. They're different things. Silicon Valley has a 70-year history and it hasn't always been VC-istan. VC-istan is just how it died.",1369342707

No.  You have to consider the distance through air.  Electricity will still take the path of least resistance which, even if you're wearing rubber or teflon shoes, is still just a couple of centimeters out of the shoe and to the ground.  As the article points out: the lightning just traveled a kilometer to get to you, so why would it care about a few centimeters or inches or <i>meters</i> of insulating material when it would just hop through the air around it and to the ground.---<p>--- I suppose that you could argue that a really large teflon pad would increase the aggregate resistance (through your nice, self-contained ocean and then over the large teflon pad) to such an extent that the lightning would pass by you and ground directly, but those would be giant shoes and the little gap between them would probably defeat the whole purpose of wearing giant teflon snow-shoes.",1369342223

5759434,comment,5755852,5758826,4,0,tmhedberg,,,"Just a few thoughts on the points you made:<p>> * The HTTP library (Network.HTTP) is not encoding-aware. It ignores Content-Type and returns a String with some undefined encoding. So if you grab a resource which is, say, ISO-8859-1, anything that works with UTF-8 will potentially blow up.<p>Agreed that the HTTP package is rough around the edges. It also doesn't support HTTPS, which seems like a major shortcoming to me. Fortunately, there are several better-designed alternatives (which have the added benefit of being more efficient), e.g. http-streams and http-conduit.<p>> * The string libraries are confusing. There is String, but also Text. Both are supposed to be Unicode-aware, but many of the operations you want are in Text, requiring conversions back and forth.<p>This pain can be mitigated somewhat by using `{-# LANGUAGE OverloadedStrings #-}`, at least when you're working with literal Strings, ByteStrings, and/or Texts. The main problem with the proliferation of string types is when using multiple libraries, each of which expect a different type of string (or one expects a strict ByteString and the other a lazy ByteString). Then the conversions can get irritating.<p>Generally speaking, you should use Text for textual strings, ByteString for binary data, and String in simple cases when the convenience of using Prelude or list functions trumps performance concerns. They all have reasonably well defined uses.<p>> * There are multiple libs for HTML/XML parsing, and no clear winner. HaXml was buggy and did not parse my HTML correctly. TagSoup and HandsomeSoup had weird APIs I did not like. I ended up with HXT, which uses Haskell arrow syntax extensively and is therefore incomprehensible, even when I understand what and how it does it. It feels a lot like people who write ambitious libs in Ruby with too much ""magic"". Haskell is a functional language and should be wonderful for parsing HTML/XML using XPath or CSS selectors, but it's a nightmare. HXT's parser is impure by default (!) and you have to google some tutorials to find out how to use its pure version, which the tutorial writers (in the same breath) dissuade you from using.<p>Have you tried the `xml` package [1]? It's not as sophisticated as something like HXT, but for a lot of uses, it does the trick and is far easier to work with. HXT is intimidating for sure, but apparently very powerful once you learn it (I haven't bothered).<p>> * For the frontend I ended up using Happstack Lite because it's small and about as easy to get started with as Sinatra. Unfortunately, the first templating system it recommends, Blaze, is crap. With Blaze you write the template inline, building an XML tree, similar to Ruby's ""Builder"" gem, but the syntax is ugly and unnecessarily complicated. The other recommended templating systems, HSP and Hamlet, are like ERB or PHP, so a serious step backwards from HAML. In the end, I could not find anything like HAML.<p>Funny, I personally think blaze-html is terrific. I like having a Haskell EDSL for HTML generation instead of having to drop into a specialized and restricted ""templating language"" for that purpose.<p>If you want something like HAML, check out `hamlet` [2]. It's directly inspired by HAML and is the main templating engine of the Yesod web framework.<p>I found Snap to be somewhat easier to work with than Happstack, after trying them both. It occupies about the same level of abstraction. Yesod is a more full-stack Rails-like framework, which some people prefer. You can pretty easily mix and match components of the different frameworks however you like; they are nice and modular. I often use snap-core, acid-state, digestive-functors, and blaze-html together for simple web apps, even though they are not all part of any one framework.<p>> * I haven't delved very deeply into Happstack yet, but like many Haskell libs it seems to make simple things more complicated than they ought to be (eg., the routing system). One annoyance I remember is the fact that HTTP verbs aren't IO, which makes code less intuitive, since obviously in a modern web app, HTTP verbs are going to be doing IO (things like talking to databases), and so you have to use liftIO a lot.<p>Frequently having to use `liftIO` is a sign that the library author overspecialized their functions to IO. If more people would write libraries using `MonadIO m => m a` instead of `IO a` that problem would basically disappear. Polymorphism is wonderful, when you are able to apply it.<p>> * Perhaps the biggest issue for me was the general lack of high-quality documentation (Happstack itself has almost none). Sure, there are tons of searchable machine-generated docs, which is great, but that documentation lacks the bits that tie everything together. Since Haskell is mainly about applying functions to values of types, it is very decentralized; knowing what function to use is only part of the game. It's just as important to know how its return value plays with the rest of the function space, because so much of Haskell revolves around composing functions in idiomatic ways. This is very different from, say, Ruby, where you know a method returns an object, and an object only has the methods its class provides; this centralizes, clusters and constrains the information into easily digestible pieces.<p>I don't disagree that more documentation is a good thing, and some libraries are under-documented. But I can also point to examples of Haskell libraries with superior documentation to nearly anything else I've encountered. Some authors really go the extra mile; it's great.<p>My experience has been that the type system plus Haddock docs are frequently enough for me to figure out a library even without any prose documentation at all. This, to me, is a huge advantage of Haskell. The types only fit together one way, and that way is the correct one. When using a library with well-designed types, you basically can't get it wrong.<p>I certainly understand why this would not be so easy for a newbie. It gets much, much easier with experience, though.<p>[1] <a href=""http://hackage.haskell.org/package/xml"" rel=""nofollow"">http://hackage.haskell.org/package/xml</a>

Many big shops like Wal-Mart that you trade with every day can resolve disputes by themselves: they have enough trust of their customers to lose. So when you pay with CC, you make them bear extra risks and costs that you are ultimately paying for in the end. If they give you a convenient and cheaper way to pay them directly and irreversibly, would you choose that option? Same for smaller guys that you happen to trust. Github is not the biggest place on earth, but if it's cheaper for you to pay $12 with BTC instead of $15 with CC, would you trust them not to steal $12 from you? (They cannot steal more than that.)<p>2. Now, to solve the problem of lousy wallet and forgotten passwords, you may use something like BitcoinPayPal which you trust and store your wallet with them. How is it different from normal PayPal? BitcoinPayPal does not have to charge your CC, so bears no risk of chargebacks. So they can make fees much lower and provide you with ""all sales are final"" option (see previous paragraph why it's good) or more efficient dispute resolution without taking money from merchant blindly (if PayPal tries to be more merchant-friendly at disputes, you'd simply call Visa to make a chargeback from PayPal itself). This will allow merchant to make a 3-7% discount for you.<p>I myself can see how many shops I trust with irreversible transactions, so I'd prefer paying like that and cheaper.

You won't like any of them, but I hope you can take me at my word that I'm not a partisan (I have a passing familiarity with Erlang that comes of maintaining a Riak cluster, and I've built some fairly large projects in Golang, but my core languages are C and Ruby).<p>* Golang has a more conventional, familiar, boring, ""safe"" language design than Erlang does. If your current language is Python, you're apt to find Golang congenial; I describe Golang to my friends as ""a modernized hybrid of Python and Java"".<p>* Golang has a more flexible concurrency offering than Erlang. It has a very flexible (statically typed, sync-or-async) first-class channel type that you can deploy anywhere in a program whether you parallelize it or not. More importantly, it has first-class support for ""conventional"" shared-everything concurrency with mutexes and semaphores and whatnot. If you're designing everything from scratch to fit your language's preferred idiom, this may not matter, but if you're porting an existing design it might matter a great deal.<p>* Golang has what I will perhaps hyperbolically refer to as first-class support for strings, with reasonably performant regular expressions, a clearly delineated ""just a bag of bytes"" type designed from scratch for high-performance buffering and packet framing/demux, and a sane approach to UTF-8 Unicode. It also turns out to be a very elegant framework (as imperative languages go) for building parsers, since you can put the concurrency stuff to work for it. These are common programming tasks and not one Erlang is well known for handling gracefully.<p>* As I understand it, both Erlang and Golang have comparable lightweight process/thread/coroutine/whatever facilities. Golang was designed from the start to handle huge numbers of demand-spawned threads with small, dynamically allocated stacks. I'm not saying Golang does this better than Erlang does, but it might be tricky to argue that Erlang's process model is better than Golang's.<p>* Erlang requires an installed runtime and executes in a VM. Golang produces native binaries. You can compile a Golang program on one machine, rsync that single binary to another machine that has never been blessed with a Golang installation of any sort, and run it without a problem.<p>* Golang has modern, extremely high-quality tooling. Entire huge Golang projects rebuild in seconds or less. The compiler is extremely helpful. Code formatting and documentation are first class problems for the toolchain. The Go package system is well thought out, and, again, is familiar to Python programmers.<p>Just some guesses as to reasons in there.",1369339973

What you basically need to know here is that entanglement describes a <i>correlation between measurements</i>, and you cannot know whether that correlation exists until you collect those measurements together. This is the fundamental reason why it does not ""transmit information"" faster than light in a certain sense. However, that phrasing is misleading because you can use it to do things which would otherwise require transmitting information faster than light.<p>I like to illustrate this by a game based on ""GHZ states"" which I call ""Betrayal."" The idea is that there are 3 people working together, but I'm going to make one of them work at cross-purposes to the other two. If the team can recover gracefully from my mischief with high probability, then they all win a big cash prize.<p>The game is simple: the three people can prepare however they want in advance, but then they must go into different (relativistically-separated) rooms, look at a screen with words on it, and hit either a button labelled 0 or a button labeled 1. Then I collect these three numbers and sum them up, to get The Sum. So if Alice hits 1, and Bob hits 0, and Carol hits 1, then the Sum is 2.<p>On the screens in the rooms, I give them a task. Sometimes I do a ""control"" experiment: I tell all three of them ""Make the sum even,"" and the team wins if it's even. Sometimes I create a <i>traitor</i>: I tell two of them, ""make the sum odd"", and one of them ""make the sum even"", and the team wins if it's odd.<p>Three classical players cannot beat this game 100% of the time, no matter how they prepare in advance. Three quantum players (i.e., three players sharing an entangled Greenberger-HorneZeilinger state) can. So if we repeat the game enough times, they can convince me that they can beat the game with higher probability than the classical limit, and thus win the big cash prize.",1369339965

It just dumps heat in it, then sends it downstream, which isn't great for fish, but it's not terrible either - the effects are minimal, and local only, by the time the water flows a bit downstream it has cooled off back to the normal temperature.<p>And you can use sea water, the salt doesn't effect the cooling ability, but I don't think there are any plants near coastlines.",1369339447

First off, why are you saying the acid is the problem?  From my reading, talking about decomposition sapping oxygen, it sounds like it's the sugar and the fact that it's a food.  And food isn't a pollutant.  You leave it alone, it rots, nobody is harmed unless you dump large amounts of it in one spot.  Now let's contrast with an actual pollutant like smoke.  A whole lot of people emitting small amounts of smoke <i>does</i> build up, and it lingers.  It causes direct harmful effects.",1369339399

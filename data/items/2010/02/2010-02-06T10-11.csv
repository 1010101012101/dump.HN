You are welcome to raise your own opinions without questioning the testicular fortitude of everyone on this site.<p>2 - Pixelmator is reliant on ImageMagick, which is governed by the ImageMagick license. This license in no way prohibits commercial use of the library, and requires only attribution. By all accounts Pixelmator has respected this license.<p>3 - Not only has Pixelmator respected the letter of the license agreement, but it even widely advertises its use of open source components. How this is a bad thing for open source in general, only you seem to know.<p>4 - To pre-empt any Stallman-esque tirades about the evils of commercial exploitation of open source software... remember that no developers are in any way forced to allow others to commercial exploit their open source work. ImageMagick has done this out of their own accord, and it would be presumptuous to assume that people <i>following their license</i> are exploiting them in a way they did not intend. Furthermore, from what I can tell Pixelmator has added <i>extremely</i> substantial functionality to ImageMagick (a top-end GUI app instead of a command-line app, really?), and is deserving of whatever commercial success they may derive from this work.",1265452602

It offers a control panel where you can add as much apps as you want (including Django, RoR, static PHP, Worpress, etc.). The only 'real' limitation you have is memory usage. I have about 15 different apps running on the smallest webfaction acocunt and it works great; comes cheap too and you don't have to update it because it's a virtual server but it is maintained by webfaction (not your version of RoR, but the system itself). If you take the cheapest package the price is between $5.50 and $9.50 a month depending on how long you want to use it.",1265452229

1106082,comment,1102540,1103998,0,0,Chronos,,,"FWIW, the black hole hologram thing is best understood in the context of an idea that has been around for quite a while: the ""Anti de Sitter / Conformal Field Theory correspondence"".  Basically, the world we think we live in <i>feels like</i> a CFT-world with 3+1 dimensions: local particles producing local forces as they travel through local space.  But the correspondence shows that some CFT-worlds are each mathematically paired with one equivalent AdS-world.  The corresponding AdS-world for us would be a 2+1 surface (something that looks a lot like a black hole) with a specific set of rules describing the interactions of the ripples on the surface.  In some sense, one could imagine the CFT-world as a holographic projection from the flat AdS-world ""film"".<p>IIRC, AdS/CFT actually turned out to have a practical application a year or two back... something to do with superconductor physics I believe.  So, in a sense, it's as ""real"" as anything mathematical is real.  Whether or not it's relevant to our interpretation of reality is an open question.<p>Oh, except for two other tidbits that came from a completely different direction in physics.<p>First, The entropy of a black hole is predicted to scale with the surface area of the event horizon.  General Relativity predicts that, once a black hole has formed, the volume of the event horizon grows with the square root of the mass that falls into it (because gravity falls off with 1/r^2), instead of the usual cube root of mass expected for physical object volumes.<p>Second, physicists have good reasons to believe that black holes are maximum entropy objects -- at minimum that's true in the thermodynamic sense of ""entropy"", because energy that falls into black holes cannot be used to perform work.  (But information entropy is almost certainly equivalent to thermodynamic entropy anyway, so you can safely extend that conclusion to maximum information entropy if you like.)<p>(Side note: technically you <i>can</i> extract work from a black hole... if it's spinning.  The ""ergosphere"" of a spinning black hole extends past the event horizon.  As you extract work from the ergosphere, you siphon angular momentum from the black hole and shrink the ergosphere.)<p>Now, combine these two tidbits about black holes, and one concludes that the maximum entropy for a region of space should grow with the surface area of the region, rather than the volume.  Doubling the radius multiplies the maximum entropy by 4, rather than the intuitive 8.  There <i>might</i> be a flaw somewhere in this reasoning -- it's mooshing together relativistic physics and classical physics in a way that's not implicitly correct.  But it presents a striking parallel with the AdS/CFT thing, which lends it some credence, and a lot of very smart people have gone looking for flaws in the idea and come up empty-handed.<p>If you combine all this together, you reach the possibility that the universe might be (in some sense) a CFT space mathematically equivalent to AdS ripples in the event horizon of a stupendously large black hole.  This paper pushes that idea further, and the short summary is that the paper attempts to derive gravity within our CFT universe almost purely as a consequence of the Second Law of Thermodynamics operating on the AdS black hole ripples.  However, the author might have just found a nice little piece of circular reasoning where he injected an unwarranted assumption, so it's not a done deal.",1265450547

3590219,comment,3589851,3589851,22,0,gioele,,,"> So a lot of the parser code is fixing the HTML author mistakes.<p>This is probably my biggest problem with most of the ideology behind HTML 5. You learn from past mistakes and HTML has no way to teach you anything because there is no error-correction-test feedback cycle.<p>How do you learn proper HTML? You write something, you load it in a browser, does it show properly? It was right. Does it show in a funny way? There must be something wrong. What? Who knows. Nobody knows because you cannot, by definition create _wrong_ HTML 5. It is just that you did not write what you think you wrote.<p>There are validators you can use to validate your page. But most of the times they will tell you that your page is wrong while it actually looks perfectly as you wish in the browser. The browser is not complaining and the page looks good... these validators must be too picky, a waste of time.<p>The problem that killed XHTML was the draconian error handling in most browser. Only Opera had a good way to handle XHTML errors: a banner that told you that the page had an error and which error. Under that banner the page, rendered as best as possible. That was a good way to learn (and to tell people that the person who wrote the site is not a pro).",1329231541

But, honestly, this one just does not cut it for me.<p>He is over simplifying everything. And his extreme view ends demoting the ""top"" of an Organization's chart. Heck I won't want to start a company to just <i>move furniture around</i>.<p>And you can not have a binary classification for a CEO - Steve Jobs or not. In reality there will be lot of people who are perhaps very skillful, experienced and work very hard at the top. So their skill level might be closer to <i>Steve Jobs</i> than your average Joe. So you have to treat it like a spectra.<p>He makes a very fair comparison of developers and similar in a software company with that of a toothpaste company. But his fairness goes for a toss, when he compares the people at the ""top"". IMO just <i>administrators</i> should have no place being in a software product company in the first place.<p>He makes a good point, that its best for the organization that if all the brains are used rather than just one brain. But he goes to the other extreme to make this one point.<p><i>Experience</i> does have a role after all. A fresh bright programmer might want to code everything up in the latest shiniest thing, if you _know_ that its a wrong decision. Then is it not your duty to explain him and convince him.<p>In such a situation, who has the luxury of acting like a university Chair, and setup a committee to take the right decision? :-)<p>So the comparison with university is wrong.

3590123,comment,3588523,3588851,2,0,jm4,,,"I don't think it's as dismal as you make it look. My brother just accepted a football scholarship at a highly academically rated BCS school. I think there are 66 BCS schools and each one gives out about 20-24 scholarships each year. It's a huge opportunity to get a free education, play a sport he loves and make lifelong relationships with his teammates. A football locker room at the highest levels is about as exclusive a club as there is. I don't know how much tuition is or the other things the scholarship includes, but I wouldn't be surprised if it approaches $200k.<p>He can be a fool, get beat up and leave without a degree or he can take advantage of an opportunity many people only dream of. The coaches aren't telling him what classes to take. He can take whatever he wants. He can choose a useless program, a great program or anything in between. He can choose to meet the minimum requirements to stay on the team and keep his scholarship or he can choose to excel academically.<p>On the field, he can choose to hide a concussion or take some time off. He won't lose his scholarship over it. Most players feel pressure to play through injuries, and although it can come from peers and coaches, they often place most of it upon themselves. They are incredibly competitive and don't want to be sidelined for anything.<p>My point is all the choices are his to make. The same applies to other players. There are few victims in this who aren't victims of their own decisions. If a kid washes out of some dumbass cake walk program for kids who don't give a shit about school, sustains injuries in a sport he would play with or without a scholarship and has zero career prospects is that the fault of the system? I don't think so.<p>There are ways to twist it around to make it look like a scam, and it's true there are plenty of things wrong with college football, specifically the BCS. It's a feeder system for the NFL, a bunch of people make piles of money and the kids don't make anything. It may be all of those things, but it is also an opportunity for the lucky recipient of a football scholarship to change his life, either for good or bad.",1329230413

Just fly up to a reasonable altitude (just enough to clear buildings in the way) and all the drone has to worry about is adjusting for wind and ""last-mile"" (your window) navigation. Once they start hitting critical mass we'd start seeing infrastructure to keep the drones moving; homing beacons and landing pads on your window, and drone towers (either standalone or grafted onto existing skyscrapers) to refuel(/charge) drones and hoist them up to a high altitude, allowing them to rely more on gliding vs. their own power.<p>2) Less of a chance to run someone over. Again; since it's not in conflict with existing infrastructure, it's less likely to suddenly find a 6-year-old in front of it. The flip side is that it's going to hurt if the drone fails and drops out of the sky; this can be remedied by a fail-safe (such as a parachute that physically breaks open at a certain velocity; independent of the nav systems)<p>3) Commercial advantages: besides the general advantages of a drone-based delivery; a flying drone doesn't get stuck in traffic as it's skipping roads entirely. Thus, using a flying drone will give you a significant advantage over your ground-based (be they human or drone) competition re: delivery times.

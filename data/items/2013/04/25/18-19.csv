Why should I continue to support a company that doesn't care? Wouldn't you rather pay a little more and have decent customer service? Usually this means you support local merchants.<p>Recently I purchased a plasma TV locally, and paid tax! Crazy, I know! But when it's time for service, I know the company will stand behind it. We need to stand behind these companies.<p>EDIT: Free plug to the retailer: Abt Electronics :)",1366916397

5609166,comment,5609020,5609020,8,0,TravisLS,,,"I thought this was going to be a post about customer development, where the issue is not generally the formatting of the questions, but asking the wrong questions in the first place, or misinterpreting the answers.<p>Surveys can be a useful tool, but nothing replaces a real conversation. Even asking more open ended questions in an email or survey form can give you so much more information than radio button answers (and unless you're a huge company, it's not too hard to read a few hundred open-ended responses).<p>Along those lines, I'll share a snippet from patio11's Microconf presentation last year (posted on HN yesterday), regarding interpreting the responses you get to a more open-ended conversation:<p>""If youre solving a problem people actually have, they will say at this point, 'Shut up and take my money.' If someone says, 'Thats kind of interesting, tell me when that exists,' you have not successfully identified a problem that people actually have.""<p>You don't get that kind of insight from radio buttons.",1366916336

It's amazingly useful if you are trying to link a variety of different elements. In fact it's practically unavoidable if you are writing highly dynamic code. Trying to manage this sort of system with a few variables and functions would become a nightmare.<p>In fact, those dynamic situations are where comments describing layout are absolutely critical. In these situations you may be using your class as a generalization, and tracking the full extent of this sort of interaction could take a ridiculous amount of time.",1366916336

Itslants things towards people who value it more in dollars. People get a higher score for this both by valuing WWDC more and by valuing dollars less. That is better than random.<p>Next time leave out the meta discussion insults.<p>Note also that, ""if demand exceeds supply, raise prices"" is basic economics and standard advice on HN for many other things. e.g. if you're a freelancer with too many people trying to hire you, patio11 would say to raise prices.<p>you would not then reply saying he didn't think things through because all that is going to accomplish is having price-insensitive clients rather than good clients.<p>EDIT and how many people go to WWDC as a hobby? how many are really price insensitive? a lot of them, even if they have money, want to get business value exceeding the ticket price, or they will not go. filtering by who can get the most business value by attending would not please certain people with certain egalitarian mindsets, but would still actually be way better than random.<p>lots of people look price insensitive because the business value for them attending is $25,000 or whatever -- far more than the ticket price. but that isn't actually price insensitivity and it's a good thing to use a system that makes sure those people get to attend.",1366916161

5609142,comment,5608768,5608972,3,0,quanticle,,,"<p><pre><code>    Furthermore, the company cannot just allow customer reps to 'bend a policy here,\n    [...] expedite an order there, [...] bubble an issue up to a manager'. If you\n    give them the freedom to bend policies, they can choose to draw their own lines\n    and that can result in adverse effects for the company overall. Bending of rules\n    is too risky for a large company to allow their customer reps to take. It's a\n    slippery slope, but honestly one that doesn't seem to have much of a solution.\n</code></pre>\nThat's not true. Zappos, for example, is famous for its excellent customer service. They can, and do give their CS reps a significant amount of autonomy (within guidelines, of course) and allow reps to make on-the-spot calls about sending replacement items or handling refunds. It's a matter of trust and customer focus. Is the company willing to trust the CS rep to make the right call? Is the company focused on doing what's right for the customer and keeping customer loyalty in the long term even when it creates costs in the short term? Both of those things are true for Zappos. I'd suspect that neither of those things are true for American Airlines.<p>So, why is that? It's not because Zappos is a small company nor is it because American Airlines is a huge one. It has to do with markets. Zappos is in a highly competitive market. Not only are they competing with other online retailers, but they're competing with brick-and-mortar stores as well. In order to sell shoes online, they know that they have to not only match the offline shopping experience, but <i>exceed</i> it, in order to make up for the inherent risk premium assigned to novel types of shopping. They edge they've chosen is customer service. Zappos has the generous return policy that it has because they know that you're already sacrificing some convenience in shopping with them. They know that it's easier to buy (and return) shoes at a brick-and-mortar store, so they want to remove as many other obstacles as they can.<p>American Airlines, on the other hand, is not in a competitive market. They've split the market with Delta, United, and Continental. They don't have to care about the customer. They know that as long as they're not significantly more or less terrible than the other three carriers, the average consumer isn't going to stick to his or her principles at the cost of a less convenient or more expensive flight. In addition, the airline business has sufficiently high barriers to entry that they don't have to worry about a competitor springing up and devouring their business overnight. That's the real reason American Airlines doesn't care about its customers. It's also the same reason that, e.g. Comcast and Verizon don't have great customer service either. Simply put, they're not forced to, so they don't.",1366916043

This transcript of Assange and Schmidt's meeting discusses this at a certain point, just grep for 'hash'[1]. That way the domain name itself is proof of its authenticity.<p>Using a hash as the name can be useful, especially where the name is only being read by a machine, e.g. you post a link and somebody can just click it, or it's part of your app which you're only using instead of an IP address in case the IP address changes. Or you can put it in a QR code or use NFC on mobile devices etc. The trouble is that it causes the name to be full of encoded data and humans can't remember it. You would still like some way of using memorable names for instances where someone is going to have to type the thing.<p>>Couldn't you also have something akin to bitcoin's blockchain, where the identity of a domain is agreed upon by the majority of the creators of the blockchain? I don't know what the equivalent of mining would be though. Assange also suggests how domains could be made hard to make, so that they can be 'mined', creating scarcity so that ""some arsehole"" doesn't ""register every short name themselves""[sic].<p>I was thinking about something like that, it seems like the trouble is how do you calibrate the amount of work to be done.

But anything significantly less formidable just isn't going to solve the problem -- at $200 you can still imagine a slew of jackasses registering all the short names. Especially when they're evildoers who are using a botnet and don't actually have to pay anything for the computing resources. And that also doesn't solve the problem of scammers getting "".bank"" or "".irs"" or something, where the point isn't that they're getting too many names, it's that they're getting unreasonably misleading names.",1366915700

I don't know what those $2000 tickets are...maybe extras held in reserve for sponsors or something that they ended up not needing.<p>I'm still not sure about your idea...it just seems to boil down to reducing the incentives while keeping the price high, so of course there is some point where you can adjust that mixture to where you will only sell the number of tickets available.<p>I agree with the argument that the keynote attracts some people that otherwise don't care (though the WWDC is always super crowded post-keynote), but considering the other conferences that have this problem, the volume of people buying tickets, and the volume of people upset with the process that denied them tickets, I'm not convinced that going keynote-less would be sufficient to erase the issues with ticket buying. And that's really the only knob you have except for raising prices, which certainly does your attendee demographics no favors.<p>I also really have to agree with saurik that, even if you can reduce demand to have tickets sell out in, say, an hour, simple distractions that morning (kids, forgotten meetings, car problems) still mean you miss it, which will again heavily skew your demographics to the set of people glued to twitter who would never have missed the 30-minute, 15-minute, and 5-minute warnings of impending ticket sales.

I could have gone the FreeBSD way, but then, well, you know. OS X just works. As a Ruby and Java developer I find it perfect.

They don't charge money, but I would have gladly paid whatever they asked. Then one day I woke up and found all my tasks were gone! Well that's what I thought at first. I soon realized they weren't gone, they had just all been removed from their respective categorized lists. I filed a ticket [1], and then emailed them when I received no response.<p>After several back-and-forth exchanges with their support, the answer I received was, sorry, we cannot restore your lists to any previous state and we don't know why it happened, all you can do is manually move them all back to their lists. All 1022 tasks. By hand. With no explanation or guarantee that it won't just randomly happen again at any point in time. And then they tack on their ""apologies for the trouble"". Absolutely astounding.<p>Not to mention, their response that they ""can't move tasks from one list to another"", or that it's not possible for them to restore my data to a previous state, is either a lie and a complacency, or it's extremely concerning in that they don't apparently have backups of data.<p>So yeah, my point is, when large companies do it, I somewhat expect it as part of their economies of scale; at least it's not personal (which could be a good and bad thing).

Knowledge and concious disregard for the fact that your work is being used to commit a crime is indeed malicious intent.<p>> Really, I am not seeing what your issue is with the comparison between the three cases. In all three cases, men faced charges of CFAA violations that were completely inappropriate.<p>In two of the cases, the men were directly involved in the commission of a computer-related crime and acted maliciously.

Since you mention radical changes, I wonder if it would be worth it for Apple to just prerecord ALL sessions, make them all available after a Keynote that has nothing to do with the conference, and then offer a WWDC week that just focused on direct contact with engineers. This would actually be better for the sessions too: many times I've had a question about a session, and either there wasn't time to answer it then, or I didn't think of it until much later. By having a conference full of people that had plenty of time to review content beforehand, you'd probably get more questions answered.",1366913742

The Norths alleged irrational and erratic behavior is carefully calibrated; its leaders know perfectly well what they are doing. Lankov even calls them perhaps the best practitioners of Machiavellian politics that can be found in the modern world. That might take things a jot too far. Joseph Stalin was of this same modern world, as were Cesar Chavez, Richard Nixon and Machiavellis irrepressible countryman, Silvio Berlusconi (whose unflagging buffoonery rivals Kim Jong-uns). But Lankovs point is well taken: the North emits bluster, brinkmanship and, from time to time, measured violence, but its leaders have known where to stop.<p>The author also dishes up a rare treat, mostly unfound in books of this genre: common sense and humility about the Norths future, a theme from beginning to end. Those looking for silver bullets or magic potions to solve the North Korean problem will not find them. And those who hope for the quick demise of the plum and jolly looking young new Kim might also reckon with his youth: if he lives to eighty-two as his grandfather, Kim Il-sung, did, he will still be around in 2065 (or 2066; experts assume he was born in 1983 but, alas, they dont really know). Instead of clear-cut policy recommendations, by the end of the book Lankov offers up a number of melancholy and unsettling scenarios for the futuresuggestions we will come to in due course.<p>Lankov is very good on the ubiquitous, top-to-bottom surveillance state created in the Democratic Peoples Republic of Korea (DPRK); he calls it the worlds closest approximation to an Orwellian nightmare. Neighbors watch neighbors; innkeepers report every guest to the police; travel permits are required to move any distance within the country; and exit from the country is of course entirely prohibited without state permission. Lankov is a bit taken aback at the draconian reach of this system, noting that in Stalins time Soviet citizens could travel freely between city and countryside, even if changing domiciles required permission. A droll and mordant humor colors this section of the book, as Lankov, a former Soviet citizen, dwells on the ubiquitous neighborhood inminban (peoples group or unit) and tacitly imagines himself living under such heavy restrictions.<p>THE BOOKS most affecting pages reveal a paradox that foreigners sense almost immediately but really have no way of explaining: I could not help but find it remarkable, Lankov writes of his years as a student in Pyongyang, how normal the daily lives usually were. People were neither brainwashed automatons nor docile slaves, but fully realized human beings who were, as often as not, warm and good-hearted people. Their concerns were similar to those of the rest of us: falling in love, family, childrens educations, job promotions. They enjoyed romance, good food, and good books, and didnt mind a glass of liquor. They also cared about health care, infant mortality and life expectancy. Mostly free national systems provided basic human services, which until the famine years put North Korea in the ranks of developed nations (life expectancy was seventy-two before the famine of the 1990s; now it is sixty-nine). Even today, child mortality is remarkably lower than in many developing countries of a comparative economic level, Lankov writes. Schoolchildrens skills in basic literacy and numeracy are also at comparatively advanced levels. Moreover, in the past decade GDP growth has averaged 1.4 percent a year (not robust but steady), and even a shimmer of affluence is now noticeable in the capital.",1366913476

That said, overtime, I realized there were several issues with the business model - The founder of Skyara (one of the first AirBnb's for experiences) was the first that realized the model didn't work.<p>The founder @stevenou shared this a few months back:<p>""While in theory it sounds like a great concept, the key to realize is that no ""AirBnB for Activites"" can ever be an ""AirBnB for Activities."" What I mean by that is: the part of the ""AirBnB for X"" business model that makes it work is the part where you have a very low marginal cost to renting out an existing resource that, presumably, is getting very low utilization. I.e. a car sitting in a garage, an empty couch. The marginal cost of renting those out... is basically zero. However, with Activities, the resource at play is actually time! A person needs to take two hours out of their day to offer a walking tour, cooking class, etc.\nArguably, time is the most scarce resource we have. People value their time highly, which means the marginal cost (in this case the opportunity cost) of them offering an activity is very high. Add to that the fact that individuals do not benefit from any sort of economy of scale, and that most likely means that they cannot compete with businesses on price (which is arguably where AirBnB is winning in its biggest market, NYC).<p>So of course, I'm not saying an ""AirBnB for Activities"" is not possible, but some fundamental problems make it significantly more difficult than one might initially expect.

For example, if I were to ask what part of my projects would be potential important for a kid trying to learn, I should be able to identify where copyright might be better removed than enforced. Until society figures out a way to not prevent children and starving people access to knowledge, all I can do is to realize when my work might prevent rather enable and then act.

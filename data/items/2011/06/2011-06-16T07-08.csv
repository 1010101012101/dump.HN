The theoretical foundation (Lebesgue measure theory) to make this mathematically rigid is a bit complex. An example to illustrate:<p>Assume you have're looking at a 2-dimensional space (over the real numbers) and you want to measure the area of subsets of it. E.g. the area of a square defined as:<p>{ (x,y) \in \R | 0 <= x <= 1 and 0 <= y <=1 }<p>Now the area of that is 1. Then carve out the y-axis like this:<p>{ (x,y) \in \R | 0 < x <= 1 and 0 <= y <=1 }<p>It's obviously a smaller set than the square above, but the set that's missing doesn't have any area (it's a line with no width). So it's sane to assume that the area of the new subset is still 1.<p>[btw: Lebesgue measure theory throws in a few more simple assumption and then derives a very nice theory for computing areas, and in extension integration of functions.]<p>Now probabilities are the same: Instead of points in the plane you have different runs of bogosort and the measure of the ""area"" for all events is defined to be 1. But you still can carve out complete ""lines"" (i.e. sets with even infinte many different runs of bogosort) that don't have any influence on the value of your total ""area"", i.e. probability.<p>To conclude, your in /pratice/ actually holds up in theory, too ;-)<p>Edit: Lebesgue measure is actually only the application onto real spaces, the fundamental thing that also applies to probabilities is just called measure theory.

If people agree peacefully to adhere to a set of rules, they have effectively formed a government, too.<p>""Just let people run their course without initiating aggression against each other, and they will fix the world's problems.""<p>But that is just what is so silly about Lomborg & Co. Obviously people running free do not fix the world's problems. They form dictatorships, exploit resources, fight wars and so on. Your condition of ""peacefully"" does not work out - people are not peaceful. In an utopia where people would be peaceful somehow it might work, but we don't live in such an utopia. And frankly I doubt such an utopia would ever exist, but that is for another discussion.<p>We seem to agree that only property management seems to solve the tragedy of the commons problem, except that you think markets create properties and I claim governments (or agreements of people) create properties. But how then do you suppose to solve the tragedy of the commons in our modern world? Air and sea pollution - how do you want to solve that, without all the governments in the world agreeing on property rules for those things? And that is not a market thing.<p>As for the elephants, how do the property owners defend against the poachers? I strongly suspect guns are involved.<p>Also, what are you supposed to do if you don't have an elephant farm? Just be consent with being poor? Poaching of elephants could probably be solved by giving everybody an elephant farm. But there aren't enough elephants to go round - and that is a fundamental problem of the human condition. There is not enough stuff to go around.<p>I think even if we could produce enough food and iPads for everyone, that problem would not go away.

This is an awkward movement that requires time for my fingers to find the arrow keys. When using 'hjkl' to navigate, my right hand is always on home row, ready to either navigate or start typing. When typing in non-vi text boxes (such as this one), I do this movement, but I don't like it.<p>I do have an inefficiency: I move my hand for the escape key (which I should remap to caps lock, but I've never gotten around to it in the past decade), but I pivot at the elbow. It's far less awkward.",1349103594

Still - it is a good idea to steer users away from arrows, inclduing to disable them in default files if you're mentoring.<p>If you introduce new users to vi on a keyboard that supports arrow navigation in insert mode, they're likely to build a habit of navigating around in insert mode, a very bad habit to have.<p>Transactional interaction is fundamental to becoming adept with vi.

If you ever wondered why vi uses 'hjkl' as left,down,up,right - this is why.</i><p>You won't find anyone who believes more strongly than I do in the importance of understanding our history. But <i>understanding</i> history is different than making a <i>fetish</i> of it, and this explanation tiptoes pretty close to the latter. OK, vi uses hjkl because the ADM-3A terminal didn't have arrow keys. But every keyboard for decades now <i>has</i> had arrow keys. Given that, what's the value in pretending they do not?<p>This explanation basically boils down to ""we do it that way because we've always done it that way,"" which is poor argumentation.<p><i>It's also a good illustration of the distinction between 'easy' and 'efficient' - the modern cursor key layout, with the 'up' in front of the 'down', is obvious, intuitive, and easy to master. No argument. But it's not the most efficient layout - it's not possible to keep all four fingers on the four navigation keys - you have to settle for three fingers and move them around. And if you're typing and suddenly need to move, you have to move completely away from where you're typing and switch to the cursors.</i><p><i>hjkl answers both issues - the four keys in a line make it possible to keep one finger on each and so move about as quickly as possible, without ever having to move from the text-entry part of the keyboard to any other. It's not as easy, not as obvious, but it's quicker and more efficient when you're used to it. Even on my modern keyboard, I go for hjkl far more than I reach for cursors.</i><p>Well sure you do, because <i>you have trained yourself to do that.</i> But how many people can say that? And what's the value in leaving everybody else out when you design your tools?<p>Anytime you talk about how UNIX-like systems have evolved, there's a danger of falling into the trap of hailing historical cruft as ""misunderstood features."" But at the end of the day, it's still just historical cruft. It's there, it won't kill anyone if it <i>stays</i> there, but it's not something awesome either.

The underlying representation is different, an interface is a pointer to a type and a pointer to a value. A string is a pointer to the character data and a length.<p>It'd get even more difficult with other data types, since an interface is two machine words, and other data types can be anything. Since a slice is backed by an array, there would be no way to do reliable indexing.<p>I do see your point: a slice could hold the type of its elements and then you'd have to prove that no other types are stored in the slice. But that's not really simple either.<p>A more consistent solution would be to store 'interface values' as pointers (rather than a pair of pointers). Then you could use a slice of pointers as a slice of interface{} (or any other interface the pointed-to type supports).",1349102512

4597154,comment,4596670,4596892,62,0,morsch,,,"The Slashdot moderation system is still fantastic. One thing I noticed recently:<p>As a popular story gets more and more comments, it gets <i>more useful</i> on Slashdot and <i>less useful</i> on Hacker News.<p>This is due to the overall UI and the moderation system. Slashdot had to implement functionality to deal with low S/N. Browsing on +5 lets you quickly get shallow overview of the interesting discussion in a short time even for stories with hundreds or thousands of comments. At the same time, you can easily burrow down on threads that seem interesting to you, e.g. see a +5's post (grand-) parent, its siblings and rebuttals. The moderation also makes it more feasible to find new ideas for a story you read in the past, and of course you can easily sort by date.<p>On Hacker News, when I visit a popular story, I usually read the first couple of screen pages, depending on my interest, that is the most highly ranked  posts <i>and their replies</i>, which are sorted inline with them. I'm sure I miss a lot of content further down the page, not to mention on the other pages, which I <i>never</i> read.<p>And when I revisit a story that seemed interesting to me -- something I often did on Slashdot --, I am completely lost on HN. Finding posts that are both high-quality and new is way too much work. Sometimes I still do it, but I spend a lot of time seeing posts I had already read. Really, the only way I end up keeping up with previous discussion is when I keep track of replies to my own posts (which works better on HN than it does on Slashdot).<p>As HN's S/N is going down, finding good posts will continue to be an increasing problem. I know there are user scripts that both enable collapsing threads and hiding/marking read posts on Hacker News. I guess I should look into those. But for a truly effective solution, you'd need to know how the posts score. (I think Slashdot's system of capping comment score at 5 is also much superior to HN's solution of hiding the score.)",1349101834

When the giant roller-skating ice cream cone appears on the screen, you can begin recording your message.  When you're finished, tap the screen.<p>(kid records a short ""Hi Dad!"" video message)<p>Voiceover: If you want to replay the message you recorded, tap the picture of the elephant in the hot tub.  If you want to re-record your video message, tap the picture of the bacon strip doing jumping jacks.  If you're happy with your recording and want to email it to Dad, tap the picture of the unicycling weiner dog.<p>(kid taps the weiner dog)<p>Voiceover: Great!  Your video message has been emailed to Dad.  Hey!  You just received a new email from Grandma.  If you're ready to view it, tap the picture of the monkey modeling ladies' hosiery.<p>(kid taps the monkey)<p>Voiceover: Here is the text of Grandma's message.

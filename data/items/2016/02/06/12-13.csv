It&#x27;s hard to predict how it would go in litigation.  I think you&#x27;re right that the defendants wouldn&#x27;t have a particularly strong case, but they wouldn&#x27;t have the weakest.<p>The courts have generally judged significant &quot;transformation&quot; of the source material to be powerful in determining fair use. I think that would be in their benefit.  Also it could be argued that this has very little effect on the market for the original copyrighted material, which would be in their favor.  Of course, the copyright holder would see and argue it differently if they choose to sue. And the &quot;the amount and substantiality of the portion taken&quot; would not look good for the defendants -- but even though some common belief focuses on this factor almost exclusively -- thinking as long as you copy only 10 pages or whatever you&#x27;re good, and if you don&#x27;t you&#x27;re definitely not -- that&#x27;s not how it works, it&#x27;s just one factor, and one that the courts in the past couple decades have somewhat de-emphasized.<p>But I don&#x27;t think we can say &quot;no way it is fair use&quot;, or &quot;it could hardly be more clear cut.&quot;  It could go either way. Fair use in the U.S. for novel things, not already well established as fair use or not, almost always looks like this.",1454763408

This hardware is directly paired with security-sensitive hardware (Touch ID, Apple Pay NFC chip, etc). It provides all cryptographic operations for data protection key management and maintains the integrity of data protection even if the kernel has been compromised.<p>So when you stick a third-party Touch ID sensor in an iPhone it&#x27;s obviously not going to be paired with the secure coprocessor.

Changing the display also involves disconnecting the Touch ID sensor so technically a malicious person might have done something that exposes the user of the device in some way.<p>Statement from an Apple spokeswoman:<p>“We protect fingerprint data using a secure enclave, which is uniquely paired to the touch ID sensor. When iPhone is serviced by an authorised Apple service provider or Apple retail store for changes that affect the touch ID sensor, the pairing is re-validated. This check ensures the device and the iOS features related to touch ID remain secure. Without this unique pairing, a malicious touch ID sensor could be substituted, thereby gaining access to the secure enclave. When iOS detects that the pairing fails, touch ID, including Apple Pay, is disabled so the device remains secure.”<p><a href=""http://www.macrumors.com/2016/02/05/error-53-home-button-iphone-brick/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.macrumors.com/2016/02/05/error-53-home-button-iph...</a>",1454762749

In the past 15-20 years, at least in my opinion, there has been an escalation in the severity of the violence.<p>As a 20 year old, going out to a pub or club, there was always the risk of getting involved in a fight.  At the time that probably would have meant a few punches, probably to the body and a lot of pushing and shoving.  We mostly drank beer and maybe some spirits later in the evening (Bourbon and Coke/Scotch and Dry etc).  Only fit people and body builders went to the gym.<p>By my 30&#x27;s glassing had become a thing in Australia, and quite often women were the perpetrators.  So many the pubs and clubs switched to plastic jugs and &quot;glasses&quot;.  There were a lot more alco-pops (premixed soft drink with vodka) being consumed.  More people were going to a gym and boxercise/body combat classes were becoming popular.<p>Sometime during my 30&#x27;s Redbull and Vodka (or some other spirit) was the drink of choice for the 20-something set.  A lot of people started going to the gym, with the guys training for bulk.<p>The two trends of increasing consumption of spirits in sugary and caffeinated mixers plus boxing training and bulking up a the gym, to me seem to be underlying causes of the increased severity of the violence.<p>Drinking beer most of the night makes you slower and sleepier.  Drinking sugary soft drinks instead makes you more energetic and less sleepy.  Drinking Redbull and other energy drinks means you are now wide awake, twitchy and drunk at the same time.<p>Combine that with some boxing training/muscle building and the stupid fights over spilled drinks/girls etc will get ugly.<p>I would prefer to see alco-pops and Redbull as a mixer banned from licensed premises.<p>Of course, beyond this is the huge problem with Ice/Methamphetamine use in Australia.  The mining boom was something of a driver of this as ice is one of the only drugs that will clear your system fast so you won&#x27;t test positive if you get randomly screened at work.",1454760856

These laws are sucking the life out of Sydney.<p>The problem here is one of culture. While our Prime Minister sets about promoting an &quot;Innovation Nation&quot;, the foundations for attracting talent are further reaching than any capital gains tax reform or optimistic prose can provide. If Australia is to have a vibrant tech sector, we need to recognize that top talent comes from the fringe - as do entrepreneurs, empirically.

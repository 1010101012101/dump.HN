If a jury looking at the image and the guy's face think the system is wrong, they can disregard it.<p>As far as prevention goes, what we need are systems that can detect deception reliably, which will help if we ever decide to ask people meaningful questions.

Consequently, the US subsidizes their drugs, insofar as they do not contribute to the costs of R&D, including research and clinical trials for working and failed drugs.<p>If every country adopts that policy, which is the direction things are headed because it's the dominant strategy, the rate of medical advancement will be much lower.  To quantify, about 58% of US medical funding is provided by private industry.  Pharmaceuticals alone spend more than the NIH.  NIH in the US spends 29 times more than NHS in the UK on health research, despite having only 6 times more people.  The US spends 4 times more per capita than Australia on medical research.  This is one of the two gigantic elephants in the healthcare debate auditorium, the other being patient outcomes for comparable patients.  Of course US aggregate data is skewed because of the general health of the population (fatness), and those without insurance, but what happens when comparing <i>patient outcomes</i> between people with insurance in the US, with people that are comparably healthy (i.e. fatness and related issues) in other countries.  The whole thing is basically a health-and-wealth transfer scheme from the insured to the uninsured.<p>We see basically the same thing whenever space research is discussed.  Pompous Europeans bash US progress and ""meager space funding"", while the US outspends the entire world combined over 3 to 1 on space research.  In the end, the ""solution"" to both is to cut spending to both medical and space research to global per-capita levels, and let the advanced research go undone, unless other countries choose to start contributing.  Of course, that would be a true tragedy of the commons.",1366566747

Typically these procedures include 2 astronauts working outside the space station (called EV1 and EV2), plus a robotics operator inside, and other actions taken by mission control on the ground. All of this is happening in parallel. Sometimes EV1 may be working on a task where all the steps can be done independent of what EV2 is doing, while other times their steps are heavily intertwined. The same goes for robotic and mission control steps.<p>Currently we write these procedures in Microsoft Word. A procedure is basically a big table, with each column of the table being the steps for each entity. So EV1's steps are in one column, EV2's in another, and so on. If EV2 has a step that has to come after one of EV1's steps, then we make sure that the later step is lower on the page than the earlier step. All of this requires a lot of formatting in Word, and we spend too much time dealing with the formatting aspect. Most of these procedures are text with ordered and unordered lists, but there are also images and diagrams.<p>What I'm looking for:<p>- A better method for writing procedures with multiple people working in parallel<p>- Ability to easily see (and diff) the entire revision history<p>- Allow multiple editors. Not necessarily Google Docs-type multiple editors, though. Instead I imagine the procedure would reference individual documents as sub-procedures, and those could further reference more sub-procedures. So each editor could be revising smaller portions of the same spacewalk procedure, but not the same portion at the same time...so a lot like software development.<p>- Bonus if it can also help manage the location of hardware and tools as they're used throughout the spacewalk<p>Is there any such software in existence? If not, is anyone interested in creating such a thing? I'm not sure how much applicability outside spacewalks there this, but there has to be some.",1366565389

It has drawbacks, but it also has advantages. Introducing new ""modern"" features to Forth adds complexity, changes this balance, and I doubt these hybrids will ever attract 'hardcode' Forth programmers or non-Forth programmers. At least traditional Forth systems are small and simple enough for someone to understand (I learned myself from a tiny Forth named PygmyForth, but there are many others); it provides you with a kit you can modify and customize at will once you've absorbed it.<p>The postfix notation even for conditionals is really not an issue when you dive into the language. However, with most systems you should be able to translate IF into 'nop', THEN into IF, and END into THEN and it should do the trick. But then there are DO WHILE loops. etc. But everyone prefers to preserve the postfix logic at the end of the day. It's like infix notation systems in Lisp and Scheme that never caught up (and, I believe, never will).<p>About your second point: most of the library code, in any language, looks like gibberish and like a mess of arbitrary idioms. One simply cannot hope to inspect and understand non trivial library code just just by casually reading it. With Forth the situation is indeed even worse, because implementers generally cannot resort to spaghetti code too much, whose continuous nature, at least, helps the casual reader.<p>On the topic of cooperative multithreading, I think that the trend in recent programming languages in general is that, nobody wants to deal with pre-emptive threads anymore. It hurts kitties, it is dirty. It is like manual dynamic memory management. Cooperative threads (if I'm not mistaken, they're also sometimes called ""lightweight threads"", ""green threads"" or ""fibers""), avoid most of the problems of preemptive threads (because the programmer controls when execution can switch to another thread and when it should not very easily), while retaining some benefits (background execution of low priority tasks). For a ""modern"" Forth system, I think it could be interesting to keep cooperative threads at user level (really hardcore implementers may just remove them completely, because it is expected that the programmer may prefer to implement some sort of cooperative tasking fitted to his needs), and use preemptive/OS threads in library code (typically implemented in C).<p>Now that's the point of view of a 'hardcore' kind of hobbyist Forth user (and implementor). There is another category that finds brutal simplicity simply not practical and I can understand that. But really for educational/curiosity purposes I would recommend the hardcore way. Like, abandon all the bloat you're addicted to, shut the <i></i><i></i> up, try hard and sincerely. I tried Forth this way because I was very sceptical when reading Moore (inventor of Forth) and Fox (one of his collaborator and friend; Moore isn't very good at communication, so Fox [RIP] was sort of his Plato) that their approach could work. These experiments in extreme simplification brought me a lot when I was a young programmer.",1366565363

Human beings who propose new treatments often have a bias to suppose that the new treaments are more safe and more effective than previous treatments--especially if they have a financial interest in the new treatment. People who have a financial interest in other treatments, or in not seeking effective treatment at all (e.g., faith healers) may have a bias that runs in the other direction. The way to check the safety and effectiveness of a treatment is to run an honest clinical trial with adequate justification from known science and sufficient statistical power. But keeping the trial honest involves human beings disciplining themselves not to jump to conclusions. As Richard Feynman said to graduates of Caltech: ""The first principle is that you must not fool yourself--and you are the easiest person to fool.""",1366564407

Im afried App.net will die soon if they cant figure out how to appeal to anyone trying to build a business (not hobbyists making free apps, because charging your users to create an account has be a negligible part of your value proposition). The only way to fix this problem is by having a generous free tier or by allowing the app pulling in new users to remain free forever, for those users you brought in through your app.<p>As an app creator, even in this situation, where the user gets a free ride in your app because shes a first time App.net user, youre asking a lot from the user. When user acquisition and retention is your bread and butter, placing a huge level of complexity at the signup step, explaining what the hell an App.net account is, its basically strangling the acquisition part, and you never, ever, want to do that.<p>Taking a step back, what problems are they solving anyway? Shorten time to market for app makers? Because social app plumbing is getting pretty cheap and easy to pull off at scale with IaaS. Besides ending up with something very limited. Using App.net to build your app must add value, either for the creator, or the user. Im failing to see how it does either. Unless, maybe, if App.net login is an optional part of your app that could lover the already in-place pricing scheme for all users (failing to see when this would make sense, but its possibly I guess).<p>Conclusion: Ask yourself, what app in the past 5 years, could have been pulled off, logistically, using app.net plumbing?",1366564176

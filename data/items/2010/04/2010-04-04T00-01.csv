Many of them gave me what I believe to be legitimate reasons to be upset, and in some cases, angry.<p>In this case, on page 60 I wrote, ""Mrs. Derrick had been no aberration. Teachers lied, even when they told students not to."" I didn't say (as you state), ""all adults lie."" Her name actually doesn't come up again until page 334, which is ""Acknowledgments,"" where I praise her and other teachers by stating, ""May the worldâ€™s teachers aspire to your example.""<p>Perhaps I'm too critical, but on the other hand, none of these stories were embellished.

1239410,comment,1239144,1239144,0,0,waleedka,,,"I use app engine for several projects, a couple of which have decent load. My biggest one is networkedblogs.com, which I started on php/mysql and recently migrated big parts of it's back-end to the app engine. My experience with it has been good, and I always build new projects on it, unless there is a good reason that prevents it. It has it's own pros and cons, but overall it's a good choice:<p>- It's easy to start with and fun to use. You shouldn't need more than one day to learn it.<p>- If you like to focus on coding and not worry about managing the server then you'll love it. But if you're a control freak and like to have access to low-level settings then you'll not.<p>- If you have prior experience with relational databases such as mysql, then you'll need an adjusting period to forget much of what you learned about databases and start thinking in new and different ways. Some things that are really easy in mysql, such as  getting the number of records in a table or joining tables, become hard on app engine and require writing code.<p>- When it goes down, you'll feel helpless that you can't do anything to bring your site back up, but you'll also feel lucky that a Google employee is carrying that beeper and have to wake up and fix it.<p>- It scales, but it's not super fast. Due to its distributed nature, individual requests rarely finish in less than 50ms and usually take 100 to 150ms (that' my experience, yours will likely differ). But it can run a huge amount of requests at the same time.<p>- It solves the scaling problem, but it's not magic. You still need to optimize the heavily used parts of your code for scaling. But at least you do it with code, rather than having to fiddle with server and cache settings.<p>- It's a paradigm shift that will eventually eliminate most of database and system admin jobs if it catches it (I think it will).<p>- It's very different from Amazon's EC2. Amazon gives you servers that you have to manage, Google manages everything for you. With ec2 you pay per server hour, with App Engine you pay for resources you use: CPU Cycles, storage, bandwidth, ...etc.<p>- It's free to start with, but if you have heavy load it's a bit more expensive than hosting dedicated servers. I think it's worth it, though, because you'll be saving a lot of your own time.<p>- It's good for the majority of projects, but if your project has special not-too-common requirements, then it might not. Check first.<p>- It only supports python and Java right now.<p>If you're in Silicon Valley and if you need more in-depth information, you can find me at the next App Engine meetup at Google on the 6th.",1270340639

You may not like what we do with AMQP but I can assure that lots of people are very happy using it in its RabbitMQ incarnation.

Is there something else you would recommend - and if so why?<p>We do actually like making our product better and appreciate constructive criticism.<p>Please do explain.<p>Also please note that RabbitMQ supports multiple protocols and one reason we like AMQP 0-8 and 0-9-1 is that they are flexible enough to make this easy (see e.g. RabbitHub on Github).<p>Cheers<p>alexis",1270340161

Not so.  I see these as goals to aspire to, not starting points.<p>Singapore's rise from one of the poorest countries in Asia to now being wealthier than Britain on a per capita basis was not founded in full democracy.  Even Europe had to go through a long evolution from the autocratic Roman Empire, to monarchies, to feudalism, aristocracies, and eventually democracy trickled in.<p>If what Kagame is doing is working, then let it work for his people, The country is now peaceful and has an inviting and reponsible environment for private enterprise to play a role in developing the country.

The joy of computers today is that people suddently have access to an amazing, powerful and versatile tool, which is the programmable computer.<p>Our computers are not designed to do one thing, they are designed to be flexible and allow lots of things to be done. That's why you can read a DVD, transcode its contents, take screen captures and send them by email or serve the whole movie, maybe even edited, to the whole world using a peer to peer application. Obviously this flexibility is not seen as a good thing by some industries, but that's a different matter.<p>Now, to interact and program this flexible machine you can do two things, or a mix of them: on the one hand, you can give the user a powerful language to express their ideas and make the computer ask only a single question (""Huh?""), and that would be a CLI and its prompt; or you can give the user a simple language of pointing and ""Huh!"" and make the computer ask the right questions to them in the hope you offer them enough options.<p>The first way is usually more powerful and flexible, easier to implement but harder to use, and the second option is way easier to use but much more difficult to implement, and there are a lot of books with dissertations about how to ask the right questions and how to choose which questions to ask, because you cannot give every option.<p>Probably, the majority of people using computers in the world today only need to be asked simple and very direct questions and a simple computer that doesn't really get in the way and uses a different metaphore could be the solution, but I challenge that the number of computer experts and power users is in the millions anyway and they need a CLI or a slightly more complex GUI to express what they want to do, so I don't think those interfaces are going to die, even if they do ""lose the battle"", if we such a battle exists. As a programmer and power user, I turn to the CLI many times a day simply because the GUI isn't asking the right questions, and I hope it remains an option in future computers.",1270339517

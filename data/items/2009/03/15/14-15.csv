516855,comment,516705,516705,0,0,larrywright,,,"I've had a similar experience. We do use some software tools to help us with the process, but I would feel very comfortable managing a moderately sized team doing Agile development using nothing but a whiteboard. It's still my teams go-to tool when we need to create ad-hoc lists of ""this is the critical list of defects to fix prior to the release"" type of lists, as well as hammering out architecture decisions.<p>That said, I now have one member of my team who is remote full time. That has made it a little less useful. We use Skype and a Logitech webcam, which helps him to be able to see the whiteboard, but he can't really participate in the drawing and writing. I'd love a two-way digital whiteboard, but alas those are fairly pricy.<p>If anyone has worked with teams like this (majority of the team on site, one or two remote), I'd love to hear suggestions on how you've overcome these problems (if in fact, you have).",1237128529

516851,comment,516778,516778,0,0,silentbicycle,,,"You can have state, several styles of OO, or even the worst sort of imperative spaghetti code in Lisp. It's not a pure functional language like Haskell -- it doesn't force you to write functionally, it just has excellent support for using FP when it suits it the problem. The design of Scheme (a Lisp dialect) <i>encourages</i> functional programming, but it's mostly via things like naming conventions -- functions which mutate state end in exclamation marks (set!), for example. You may consider this nagging, but it's easy to ignore. It's not a bad idea to know which parts of your program depend on mutating state, though.<p>Good libraries, particularly multimedia ones, will be <i>very</i> important. Chicken Scheme has a great library collection (<a href=""http://www.call-with-current-continuation.org/eggs/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.call-with-current-continuation.org/eggs/</a>) and works well with C. (Chicken compiles Scheme to C.) Other people here strongly recommend PLT Scheme, though I haven't personally used it much.<p>For learning functional programming in Lisp, I'd recommend starting with <i>The Little Schemer</i>. After that, <i>The Seasoned Schemer</i> and/or <i>SICP</i>.<p>I would also consider Lua under those circumstances. Game programming is one of its strongest areas, and IMHO it is a very practical and well-designed language. (Lua and Scheme are, by far, my favorites.) You can also do FP in Lua, though it's not really emphasized, so Scheme is better suited to learning it.",1237127987

516848,comment,515749,515749,0,0,Hexstream,,,"Choice quotes:<p>""When someone demands to know how we are going to replace newspapers, they are really demanding to be told that we are not living through a revolution. They are demanding to be told that old systems won’t break before new systems are in place. They are demanding to be told that ancient social bargains aren’t in peril, that core institutions will be spared, that new methods of spreading information will improve previous practice rather than upending it. They are demanding to be lied to.<p>There are fewer and fewer people who can convincingly tell such a lie.<p>[...]<p>Society doesn’t need newspapers. What we need is journalism. For a century, the imperatives to strengthen journalism and to strengthen newspapers have been so tightly wound as to be indistinguishable. That’s been a fine accident to have, but when that accident stops, as it is stopping before our eyes, we’re going to need lots of other ways to strengthen journalism instead.<p>When we shift our attention from ’save newspapers’ to ’save society’, the imperative changes from ‘preserve the current institutions’ to ‘do whatever works.’ And what works today isn’t the same as what used to work.""",1237127815

516834,story,,,5,2,tokenadult,"Ask HN: Would you like to have a whiteboard for HN comments?",,"I wonder how many Hacker News participants would like to use visual diagrams or charts, perhaps simply hand-drawn, to add to their comments on submitted links. I tend to think visually, but I hardly ever show people sketches or diagrams in online discussions because the typical technology for online discussion isn't friendly for that.<p>Today, most all of us have one possible workaround for sharing visual information in comments.<p>1) Draw a drawing or plot a chart with any convenient software (including hand-drawing software) installed on one's own computer.<p>2) Save the drawing as a file in some highly universal format browsers can handle, e.g. .GIF.<p>3) Post the drawing to the Web on some website one can submit files to.<p>4) Post the link in the comment and hope readers follow the link.<p>That's not all bad. That's much better than most of us can do during a live telephone conversation. But maybe more convenience would bring more diagrams into online discussion, and improve the quality of discussion of some issues. Edwin Tufte<p>http://www.edwardtufte.com/bboard/q-and-a?topic_id=1<p>of course has great writings about how to use diagrams to analyze and present data better, and there are many other guides to that important topic.<p>P.S. One good example of online use of diagrams to dispel a common misconception is<p>http://www.iapsych.com/iqach.pdf<p>which expresses an idea that can apply to other issues about correlations.",1237126265

The answer probably hinges upon the type of cancer, the treatment available, etc, but clearly this is not something you'd use for a population screening tool.<p>Up until ~4 years ago, the risk of miscarriage from amniocentesis was thought to be 1/200, but if the 1/1600 number is true, that's good. Nevertheless, it's not something that you're going to want to be doing to every pregnant woman. On the other hand, we draw plenty of blood from pregnant women, so we can essentially get this without additional risk to the fetus, except the risk of elective termination.",1292191199

Hiring a self-titled ""Web Programmer"" to do VMWare work is probably not a good fit, not interesting for them.  But it is not unreasonable to find that they are capable of doing the work if they wanted to.  We need to be careful about categorizations.<p>I see your point about basket weaving, but when I went to school, I did not see a class for it in my CS curriculum, and I also did not see ""systems programmer 101"" or ""web development 101"".  These are applications.  In CS, we learn how to navigate in all these fields, whatever their rules... that is, out in the field, we can learn enough of basket weaving to create a software model for it.  The point is that we can solve the problem in software.<p>Really, it is because of this nonsense that I gave up on recruiters entirely and learned to go directly to the technical hiring managers.  The good ones do not use requirements checklists with bullet points like ""knows C++"", ""has programmed in linux"", and ""knows basket weaving"".<p>Edit addition: This thinking would be career-limiting on me because I have adopted a mindset that boxes me in, focusing in the wrong things.",1292190925

But it's the focus on getting the basic fundamentals as easy for people to use as possible which has created the Twilio loyalty and fandom they have relative to voxeo/tropo.<p>Twilio has (imo) about a year to add some more features that people are asking for before people jump ship.  They should not waste that goodwill and rest on their laurels.  But it's going to be easier for them to grow their success with smaller shops and indies in to something larger as those smaller shops and projects grow to larger needs than it is for 'enterprise'-focused groups to prove to the smaller players that they 'get' the independent developer market.<p>You can suggest that this is 'just' marketing/evangelism.  I suspect it's a bit more - a focused simplicity on getting a few core things down first rather than trying to offer multiple services on day one.  That doesn't appeal to everyone, but I think it's helped more than hurt in Twilio's case.  Simply by having more options up front you're forcing people to have to learn a lot more about stuff on <i>your</i> terms when making an evaluation.  For example, Tropo's APIs - 'webapi' vs 'scripting'.  Huh?  What are the differences?

A software developer hacker/engineer/programmer solves problems, using the software as a tool to that end.  There are surely several domains in which they may work, but the real skills -- the ability to put together code, debug, etc and not the memorization of the business rules of each domain -- are what makes the programmer.<p>I can understand if a hiring manager wants somebody who has some experience in some OS, in using Dreamweaver, in knowing the Java language, or in some other platform.  These are just toys, though.  I agree that that experience is a bonus, but the real core skillset has nothing to do with any particular toy.  The hiring manager will easily miss good developers with such a narrow-minded focus.<p>And certainly, strong experience in any of the items of this list should not suggest that the developer cannot also do GUI programming, web programming, JavaScript, or any of the like.  These are simply environments.  Everyone has to learn the local company's codebase or some business's specific rules.<p>I have never seen an educational institution use these terms.  Nobody gets a serious degree in ""systems programming"" or ""web frontend development"".  If they do, avoid that institution!<p>What you want in a developer is the ability to learn, the ability to think, and the ability to communicate on things that make some hardware operate.  But call them a ""systems programmer"", and we do a grave disservice to our industry.  Distinct skill set?  No way.  Don't let the pencil-pushers carve us into tidy little imaginary fields.  They do that because they are trying to measure the work.  As someone who has experience in all the levels from our computer's digital circuits up to databases and sideways to some pretty graphics and sound, I can assure you that these definitions are ridiculous.

1998127,comment,1997341,1997341,0,0,ChristianMarks,,,"Moggi used monads in category theory to define computations with side effects in functional programming. The basic insight is that in addition to the values of various types in functional programming, there are ""computations"" of various types. Examples of ""computations"" would be exceptions or continuations. Each monad defines for each value type a computation ""containing"" that type, and the whole type system of values you started with can be embedded in a new type system with new computation types.<p>Monads in category theory are an algebraic device for embedding a category--usually a cartesian closed category--of types of values into a new category with types of computations. However, the correspondence between Haskell monads and category monads are related by a series of adjunctions.<p>Suppose that C is a cartesian closed category and M:C->C is a monad with natural transformations e:1->M\n(the unit) and u:MM->M (the multiplication).<p>We assume a fixed choice of products and compatible exponentials: for each type A of C,<p><pre><code>  A x ( ) -| [A -> ( )]\n</code></pre>\nHere's the adjunction<p><pre><code>  MA -> [[A->MB] -> MB]\n  ---------------------\n  MA x [A -> MB] -> MB\n  ---------------------\n  [MA -> MB] x MA -> MB\n  -----------------------\n  [A -> MB] -> [MA -> MB]\n</code></pre>\nThe final map is given by currying, but it can also be motivated as follows if you think of the exponentials as internal hom sets. If g:A -> MB is in C, so \nthat g:A->B is in the Kleisli category C^M, then u_{MB}oM(g):MA->MB. We can write this as the lambda term \lambda x\in A A -> MB.u_{MB} oM x<p>This lambda term corresponds to composition in the Kleisli category C^M of C, and belongs to the internal language LL(C), the simply typed lambda calculus determined by C.

What if that guy was rubbed down with the bomb detection cloth pad (name?) which is then placed in the explosives detector?  After a few weeks of being sewn up, would he trigger an alarm?<p>What's interesting about this scheme is that the bomb would be ready-to-go, and the terrorist could throw himself right before hitting his remote control button toward the area of the plane deemed to maximize the likelihood of death.<p>Is this scenario at all possible?  How could the TSA possibly deal with it without harassing a bunch of people with pacemakers installed?

In short, Perl fundamentally sucks in ways that impact your life in big ways on a day-to-day basis. Python does have its problems, and it sucks in some respects, but I would claim that it doesn't reach nearly the level of fundamental suckage on an absolute scale that Perl does.<p>And, moreover, while Lisp fails to suck in certain ways that Python sucks, it ruins your life in other ways that Python doesn't. For example, I use lots of numpy/scipy/matlab/what-have-you style code. I also use lots of Cairo/GTK. In Python, all the stupid crap to take care of doing that in a Python-idiomatic way has been done already; it's known as pygtk and pycairo, and it's available in every package manager I care about.<p>In Lisp, all that stupid crap has not been done, or if someone has tried, they have not achieved remotely the level of polish of the Python version. So if I want to use Lisp, I have to spend a pretty big quantity of time becoming the maintainer of the equivalents of pygtk, pycairo, etc., and at least last I checked, the amount of crap and slowdown involved there was much greater than the amount of crap and slowdown that resulted from Python's various sucky bits (slowness, lack of threading, lack of macros, shitty lambdas).<p>And, moreover, Lisp's lack of syntax is a big win in some kinds of code, but in other kinds of code, it's pretty horrible; for example, with Numpy, I can say<p>myarray[where(other_array > 0)] = foo(bar(5))<p>or<p>myarray[:, baz(bum(4)):baz(bum(5))][bum(baz(6)):, :]<p>and that's going to be several times more succinct than writing my own slicing code and then having to say 'aref' or equivalent for each node in the syntax tree where there's some array indexing going on. In other words, syntax makes the common case fast for some very key common cases.<p>So saying that a key part of why Lisp fails is because it's too good and people have to be too smart to understand it is mischaracterizing people who decide to use Python because they don't want to deal with the library problems and lack of common-case syntactic convenience.<p>(I'm not wedded to being one of the latter people, but I do think that there are some strong points in that direction.)",1292188649

1998005,comment,1997200,1997200,0,0,nostrademons,,,"A few other things:<p>One-click rollbacks.  It's really, really important that when you deploy a release to the production servers, you can un-deploy it with a single click or command.  That means all changes should be logged, and all the old files should be kept around until the next release.  You hopefully won't have to use this often, but when you do, it's a lifesaver to be able to say ""Okay, we'll rollback and fix the problem at our leisure"" rather than frantically trying to get the servers back online.<p>Staging/production configs.  If you do need to have differences between staging & production configs, try to limit them to a single overrides file.  This should not contain app config that changes frequently, and should be limited to things like debug options and Patrick's ""don't e-mail all these people"" flag.  Check in both the staging and production config overrides, but don't check in the actual filename under which the system looks for them.  On the actual machines, cp the appropriate config to the appropriate location, and then leave it there.  This way it doesn't get blown away when you redeploy, and you don't need to manual work to update it on deployment.  (I suppose you could have your deployment scripts take a staging or production arg and copy it over appropriately, but this is the poor-man's version.)<p>Deployment schedule.  I'd really recommend having a set, periodic deployment schedule, maybe even run off a cronjob.  The problem with manual deployments is they usually happen only when people get around to it, and by then, dozens of changes have gone in.  If something goes wrong, it's hard to isolate the actual problem.  Also, deploying infrequently is bad for your users: it means they have to wait longer for updates, and they don't get the feeling that they're visiting a living, dynamic, frequently-updated website.<p>The holy grail for deployment is push-on-green.  This is a continuous-integration model where you have a daemon process that continually checks out the latest source code, runs all the unit tests, deploys it to the staging server, runs all the functional & integration tests, and if everything passes, pushes the software straight to the production servers.  Obviously, you need very good automatic test coverage for this to work, because the decision on whether to push is completely automatic and is based on whether the tests pass.  But it has big benefits for both reliability and morale as team size grows, and big benefits for users as they get the latest features quickly and you can measure the impact of what you're doing immediately.  I believe FaceBook uses this system, and I know of one team inside Google that has the technical capability to do this, although in practice they still have some manual oversight.<p>Third-party software.  I know Patrick recommended using apt-get, but I'm going to counter-recommend pulling any third-party code you use into your own source tree and building it with your own build tools.  (Oftentimes you'll see all third-party software in its own directory, which makes it easier to audit for license compliance.)  You should integrate in a new version when you have a big block of spare time, because it'll most likely be a long, painful process.<p>There are two main reasons for this. 1) is versioning.  When you apt-get a package, you get the most recent version packaged version.  This is not always the most recent version, nor is it always compatible with previous versions.  You do not want to be tracking down a subtle version incompatibility when you're setting up a new server or deploying a new version to the production servers - or worse, when you rollback a change.  (If you do insist on using apt-get, make sure that you specify the version for the package to avoid this.)<p>2.) is platforms.  If you always use Debian-based systems, apt-get works great.  But what if one of your devs wants to use a MacBook?  What if you switch hosts and your new host uses a RedHat-based system?  The build-from-source installers usually have mechanisms to account for different platforms; open-source software usually wants the widest possible audience of developers.  The pre-packaged versions, not so much.  And there're often subtle differences between the packaged versions and the source - I recall that PIL had a different import path when it was built & installed from source vs. when it was installed through apt-get.",1292187762

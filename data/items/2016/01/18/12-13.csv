If tired I found out that I make mistakes that I have to repair the next day. This cannibalizes my concentrated time on this next day, so I try to avoid this. Of course, if tired stupid work can still be done unless it eats into the recreation (which is: make sure you are not tired the next day).<p>I hardly know anyone who is effective beyond the usual 40 hours week. I attended meetings with totally overworked colleagues which did not come to a goal after hours of blabla.

Everybody awake, well prepared and belonging in that meeting.\nBut here everybody has to find its own best performance limits.<p>I also agree with other comments that we should not work more, but better. We automatize work to win time and enhance quality of life, not to get into competition about less and less work.

The BHA could conceivably decide to withdraw that status.<p>I was very careful in my earlier post not to specifically mention the UK government, although perhaps it was too strongly intimated. Your points about laying on an exchange not being a special case in betting does absolutely hold true in the UK. The point is not so well established in other countries. Why is Betfair regulated by the Tasmanian Gaming Commission in Australia? Other States wouldn&#x27;t issue them a licence at the time. Why does Betfair restrict access by residents in so many other countries? See the recent withdrawal of Betfair from the Canadian market.[0]<p>The point being, Betfair isn&#x27;t just a UK operation anymore. They need to take into account global jurisdictions and being high profile about fraud prevention can only help their image when hoping to expand to new markets.<p>Lastly, I use Betfair, Smarkets and to a lesser extent Betdaq every day.

It always returns a valid address, even though your system may have out of memory.<p>(b) by the time the kernel finds out that it&#x27;s run out of physical pages, your process is already trying to use that memory... which means there&#x27;s no way for your process to cope gracefully.

As it is possible to lay results on an exchange, it does present ideal opportunity for nefarious betting activity.<p>With a traditional bookmaker, it&#x27;s extremely difficult to consistently win large amounts over time and multiple events. The bookmakers just close or severely limit winning accounts.<p>On an exchange, there&#x27;s no incentive to limit these winning accounts, whether they&#x27;re backing or laying. The marketplace needs liquidity.<p>However, I still think the government(s) who issue gambling licenses may at some point take a view that betting exchanges are no longer legal business ventures, if there is too much evidence of corrupt betting, especially on the lay side.<p>You may think that once the genie is out of the bottle, there&#x27;s no way for a government to put it back again by banning or de-licensing exchanges. The exchange just moves offshore to Malta. However, I believe the current Authorised Betting Partner (ABP)[0] debacle happening in British horse racing is evidence that industry bodies could make it very difficult in the future for offshore bookmakers/exchanges to market themselves effectively.<p>Anyway, my point is, that it&#x27;s really in Betfair&#x27;s own self interest to be so hot on fraud and corruption, when they provide (unlicensed) people the ability to lay bets and that the legitimacy of exchanges may be called into question at any time.

I don&#x27;t think RAII is very nice (python-esque with-statement would be nicer IMO), exception safety is really a mental overhead unless you restrict exceptions to a minimum and the copy-assign-move semantics do add a bit of work to every class you introduce.<p>These are not outrageous claims, they&#x27;re rather valid opinions.

Attaching complex semantics to types (overloading, templates) and virtual functions/inheritance (when overused) makes reading code much harder and often you need to resort to stepping in the debugger to find out where a function call actually leads.<p>Well written C++ can be really nice at best, but unfortunately most C++ code bases out there seem to be either a bastard mix of C, Java and C++ styles or over-the-board boost-ey template mess.

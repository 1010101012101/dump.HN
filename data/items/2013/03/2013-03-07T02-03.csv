5335733,comment,5334449,5335259,2,0,spikels,,,"This and Holder's statements on drone attacks in the US are just two more examples of our government creating problems rather than solving them.<p>It seems the underlying trend, regardless or political party or position, is the continual accumulation of power. Instead of primarily attempting to solve problems each new law, regulation or spending program grants some politician or government employee some additional power.<p>The only solution I can see is to somehow put limits on their power. This would have two benefits: (1) it would be less likely the power would be abused (say a politically ambitious government employee putting you in jail); and (2) it would reduce the incentive for powerful interests and their lobbyists to influence government policy.<p>The tradeoff would be a reduced ability to actually solve problems. If you think, like me, that on balance their power is being primarily abused rather than used to actually solve problems then some of their power should be taken away.<p>Unfortunately I don't see how this could possibly be accomplished. Other than the limits in the Constitution and the Bill of Rights as interpreted by the Supreme Court nothing stands in the way of politicians and government simply granting themselves more and more power.

5335728,comment,5335303,5335303,1,0,cadalac,,,"I'm in a different field, but here's some thoughts:<p>Keep in mind that you need to be prepared to present yourself once you graduate. If you have any college projects that can serve to showcase your abilities then work really hard on them. Try to contact different people who could hire you and network. Ask them questions about their company, what skills are necessary and appreciated in the industry. Do this because you will realize that company cultures and people vary considerably. You need to develop an eye for the types of people that you will work well with and find out who they are. Try going to different user group meetings for languages or topics your interested in and talking to people.<p>The reason I'm saying all this is because these are the skills that aren't taught in schools. On your own, you have to find out how much your worth so you can negotiate a fair salary. You need to know this because if someone offers to pay you below what your worth it's usually a sign they are looking to take advantage of you.<p>I hope this helps and of course best of luck. :-)",1362624784

5335710,comment,5335627,5335627,2,0,acesubido,,,"I guess the reason why your client chose ExtJS of Sencha instead of Backbone/Ember/Angular is due to the level of support they can get from Sencha, not because of any advantages or what not.<p>Decisions like that don't come from developers, they come from the typical 'business guy'. Generally speaking bleeding-edge frameworks don't bode that well for any business guy. If a problem arises and a developer gets stuck, a developer just googles it and looks for ways to tinker with it - in the eyes of the 'business guy' they'd opt to throw money at the problem for it to go away, no time should spent troubleshooting or googling.<p>To sum it up: your client can't rely on a community of people that supports things only in their spare time. Thus by gaining comfort and trust from buying ExtJS contracts (<a href=""https://www.sencha.com/store/extjs/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.sencha.com/store/extjs/</a>) - whenever something goes wrong, your client's dev team gets stuck or needs training they can choke the hell out of Sencha for it.<p>Just let them go through with ExtJS.

Being in one page and getting their things done quickly is far better than taking too much time learning things and contemplating on what framework to use.",1362624540

Anyone who actually wants to use NaCl with Node.js (and we do) can trivially get a 64-bit build (it's even done through Python). I don't disagree that the original author of node-nacl wasn't skilled enough to do it though.<p>> There's also the elephant in the room: Windows. NaCl doesn't support Windows.<p>Say what? NaCl supports Windows just fine  it's just djb's 'do' build script that doesn't, along with how to get a random number. There's absolutely nothing to prevent anyone from using NaCl on Windows, if they are willing to integrate it into a normal Windows build system (which is...trivial) and make a few, trivial, API updates.<p>----<p>Having addressed those mis-understandings, Sodium is a welcome development and will certainly make it <i>easier</i> for people to develop bindings to NaCl.",1362624446
5335705,comment,5335271,5335489,4,0,manuelflara,,,"I can't speak for Parse, but I use both of these technologies in one site. Memcached is, well, for any kind data that you want to cache: results of SQL queries, blocks of the site (HTML), etc. Redis, on the other hand, it's a final data storage on its own (like MySQL, because it's also persistent), but it's faster than MySQL for certain things. For example, for things like ""List of profiles I've visited / have visited me recently on Facebook"". This seems like a very simple MySQL table and query, but once it becomes big it starts to get slow. On the other hand, you can have one key per user on Redis, like ""<id_user>_visit_history"" which is a sorted set of <time, id_user>. You could do the same with Memcached (although it doesn't support the same data types), but then it wouldn't be persistent.",1362624434

Which feels a little strange.<p>The reason I'm drawn to the work of DJB is because of his fanatical attention to security-related detail.  He wrote and released his own high performance mail server, DNS server, web server, and logging replacement during a period of time when server-side software was plagued with exploitation, and people have only ever found, what, <i>two</i> somewhat minor bugs? Ever?<p>So what he creates is almost always amazingly solid, but for all his attention to security perfection, his software is also amazingly unusable.  Want to run publicfile? First, forget everything you know about standard unix directory structures, because DBJ doesn't like them.<p>I feel somewhat the same way about NaCL.  We can bet the lives of our first born children that the implementation won't suffer any of the bugs that OpenSSL has over the years.  Side channel attacks, memory corruption bugs, and timing problems will almost certainly be nonexistent, and someone could probably do their PhD thesis on documenting why.<p>But like his other software, NaCL has weird usability quirks.  This project points out that some of those quirks were certainly manifest in the implementation, but some of them shine through the API itself as well.  Like his other software, my sense has been that interacting with NaCL is something that we would almost have to put up with in order to avail ourselves of DJB's greatness, rather than simple joy.<p>So a rewrite that's API compatible isn't super immediately appealing to me, in the same way that I don't think I'd be particularly drawn to an interface-compatible version of qmail or publicfile that was written by someone else, when the value was in DJB having written them to begin with rather than the interface (the horror!) they provided.<p>Although to be fair, it's certainly not as if anything else is that much more usable in this world right now.",1362623484

Some familiar examples: a gun-to-the-head hostage situation, a mass shooter, and a person opening fire on law enforcement. In these scenarios, the perpetrator would typically be killed by law enforcement.<p>There are also circumstances in which the US military may kill US citizens on US soil. The Civil War is perhaps the best example. The Confederacy was not deemed a sovereign nation. Its soldiers were deemed US citizens engaged in criminal activity. When the US armed forces killed Confederate soldiers, they were killing US citizens without trial. I say this without an ounce of condemnation. It is just the bleak historical reality.<p>So it is clear that both federal law enforcement and the military may at times kill US citizens on US soil.

I must say that this response is quite disappointing. Accusing an honest new customer excited about your new product of potential fraud as the first communication from coinbase.com is probably the worst thing a company can do for its PR. 
This has been a valuable lesson for me that accusing customers of fraud before they actually commit it is not a great way of promoting a new service.

If you set a minimal price for certain item, that makes anybody holding the same item with lesser value effectively unable to sell it. If you set a minmal price for a car at $20k, you wouldn't be able to sell a used car once its value fell below $20k. Selling one's services abides by the same laws - price floor means excluding items with value less than the floor.",1362621712

The main distinction is that wearable computers 1) have an even easier form factor to expedite surveillance and 2) the whole ""continuous connection to the cloud"" fear of footage and data being uploaded. Certainly the latter issue can also apply to smartphones, but this is more literally in your face.",1362621705

We don't have the technology for making ethical or legal determinations about the <i>rightness</i> of targeting someone; I'm talking purely about the physical capabilities of machines v. humans.<p>Only Congress can bind the Executive on such matters. The incumbent administration can eschew any intention of using drones domestically (as they have done) but can't bind future administrations.",1362621678

They're also the second largest employer in America.<p>While I admit this article is a tad political, I would like to raise awareness of this as it is really a critical problem.

Coinbase does not act as an intermediary or marketplace between other buyers and sellers of bitcoin.</i><p>What's the effective exchange rate for customers?  You already say you take 1% of each transaction; is the exchange rate tied to the current trading price of one of the major exchanges, or are you setting that yourself (like retailers do for foreign currency)?<p>I imagine you're doing some of your own arbitrage, here.  That's fine as long as prices keep going up.  What happens if prices crash and a bunch of people put in buy orders?  I assume this is where the 48hr window you give yourself to ""retrieve offline funds"" comes in.  In that event, what price do your customers pay?  The market rate when they put in the buy order, or the rate 48 hrs later when you deliver the bitcoins?<p>It's an intriguing and exciting service, but I fear you're either leaving yourself open to massive liability, or are going to be forced to screw over your customers in the event of rapid swings in the value of BtC.",1362621650

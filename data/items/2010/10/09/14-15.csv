Nope,  these guys decided to spend five months developing a framework for their application,  and then they were going to spend the next month developing the actual app.<p>Well,  six months later,  I hear that the predictable outcome had happened:  management was shocked to discover that the application took 30 seconds to serve up a page view.<p>My pal sent me a copy of the app and it was an absolute rat's nest:  the kind of project where you use 1500 lines of code to say what you could say in 15.

Bad ideas can get in,  and stay in -- nothing challenges the arrogance of the uninformed.<p>If,  on the other hand,  you are humble,  and ""know what you don't know"",  a rapid prototype can be a powerful way to get some experience,  test your ideas,  and,  who knows,  maybe even ship something.",1286633229

In the context of programming AND startups, his opinions have much more weight to me than XP proponents'.<p>Joel has created a successful company that is apparently fun to work in, have shipped several working and commercially successful products and made a service for human-kind by designing and successfully launching programming Q&A site that doesn't suck. Plus his writings inspired a generation of programmers to start companies, just like PG's writings did later.<p>Contrast this with Extreme Programming that OP embraces as a third option compared to duct tape programming vs analysis-paralysis. I was very excited about XP when I was young and inexperienced programmer, but nowadays XP sounds much more snake-oil salesmanship to me than Joel's opinions. Did original XP gang work in startup like environments, or were they actually solving problems (payroll systems) that they and many others had already solved? And Kent Beck seems to be still working on jUnit (and trying to find a way to monetize it), not shipping new products.<p>My kudos goes to Joel and duct tape programmers around the world.",1286633058

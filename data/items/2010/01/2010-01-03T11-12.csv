It's called going to the homepage. And I'd be surprised if the majority of Hacker News didn't know what 37signals is, and likewise with Balsamiq. Peldi's like one of the most active and well-known entrepreneurs here.",1262519985

1028453,comment,1028418,1028440,0,0,cperciva,,,"I think you're right on both counts.  I have a friend who is trying to find a way to make the Tarsnap website look nicer without losing its essential geeky/minimalist character; if/when he comes up with something I'll definitely be doing some testing to see how it compares.  That said, I don't think Tarsnap's conversion rate is particularly bad -- I'd say that most important issue is simply getting people to the Tarsnap website in the first place.<p>Promoting Tarsnap as a solution for OS X runs into the GUI problem: Most OS X users don't have a clue what to do with a command-line interface.  Tarsnap will gain a GUI at some point in the future, but of course this is a rather non-trivial amount of code to write...",1262519734

Why?<p>Most churches take care of homeless and the helpless and help members of their congregation (in whatever situation, including bereavement).<p>In the USA, a lot of the top tier universities were started by churches. Surely this isn’t a bad thing? AFAIK, almost 30% of hospitals in the USA are owned by the Catholic Church.<p>The Catholic Church (which receives most of its money from abroad) basically built the education and healthcare system of Lesotho (as an example).<p>Saying that they aren’t charities just because you have an irrational hatred towards churches isn’t a reason.

1028441,comment,1028414,1028414,0,0,derefr,,,"> The industrial designers let loose on the Mac have screwed up most of the keyboards by cutting their function keys in half so the total depth of the keyboard was reduced by half a key. Why was this incredibly stupid?<p>It wasn't; Macs don't <i>use</i> function keys for anything (or, at least, anything touch-type-y.) They're there for compatibility with the few non-HIG apps that demand them (and now for Bootcamp), but mostly they've been repurposed into controls for very deliberate system actions (like summoning Expose or advancing a track on your music player) that you wish to trigger far <i>less</i> often than you want to type an @ symbol.",1262518391

Your web page, for instance, is very plain, which to someone like me is great.  But people seem to not like that, for whatever reason.  Maybe you should do some A/B testing with a ""flashier"" (but no flash, please!) version?  I would be curious to hear about the results.  This is one of those things that irritates me about the world at times: people ought to be looking at your product and its price, rather than fades, drop shadows and the like... but they don't.<p>Also: he's targeting people used to paying for stuff, whereas lots of Linux and BSD people are, well, kind of stingy.  Maybe a bigger push towards Mac would be another idea?",1262518340

Or at least that's been my experience, and is somewhat confirmed by most of my friends here.  I don't know any 'geeks' here who are as socially out of place as many in the US - everyone has friends, most all of them have girlfriends, social lives, and hobbies and activities outside of computers.",1262517893

That is pure scare mongering and I don't think there is even the remotest possibility they would get away with it. If they even tried Google would wrap them in counter-defence so fast it would be funny.<p>Also, for the record, your search history may be criminally suggestive but it is not something they could use to actually prosecute you (this is something I do know about).

I cite Sun's OpenOffice effort as one example. Cast your mind back further and there was Caldera Network Desktop backed by Novell (who were a powerful corporation back then). Even today there's Umbuntu. So we can clearly see that <i>many</i> people have tried to make Linux successful on the desktop, and all have failed.",1262516998

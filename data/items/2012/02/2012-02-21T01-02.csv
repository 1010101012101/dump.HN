3614857,comment,3613336,3614730,1,0,robomartin,,,"Sure.  Makes sense. The question really is about whether or not some of these applications can tolerate errors in the order of 1%.  I contend that those application are few and far between, particularly in this day and age.  People don't want to go backwards.<p>For example, I can do photorealistic rendering of mechanical models from Solidworks.  A 1% error in the output of these calculations would not be acceptable.  The quality of the images would not be the same.  Play with this in Photoshop and see what 1 1% error means to images.  I would have zero interest in a graphics card that ran faster, used less power but offered a 1% error in calculations.  That's an instant deal breaker.<p>I can see the competitors' marketing: ""Buy the other brand if you want 1% errors"".<p>Does a radiologist care about the processing of an MRI happening faster?  Sure.  Can he/she tolerate a 1% error in the resulting images?  Probably not.  He probably wants more detail and resolution rather than less.  I wouldn't want him/her to be evaluating MRI's with a baked-in 1% error.  I think it is ridiculous to think that this sort of thing is actually useful outside of a very narrow field within which errors would be OK.<p>I'm still waiting for someone to rattle-off 100 to 1,000 applications where this would be actually acceptable.  Without that it is nothing more than a fun lab experiment with lots of funding to burn but no real-world utility.<p>Let's check in ten years and see where it's gone.",1329789574

It's much the same fallacy of the medical test for a disease that occurs in 1 out of 1000 people, and which has 99% accuracy -- but that still means a 90% false positive rate.<p>It reminds me of the claims of being able to identify, for example, the gender of an author with ~65% accuracy -- which is really actually completely unimpressive, as it's hardly better than guessing, and certainly not something you could rely on for any serious purpose.<p>The author mentions that topic is one way to help correlate beyond the results of the algorithm.  But if I wrote ""anonymous"" posts in my area of expertise, you certainly would not need stylistic analysis to guess what my identity might be!

Rich talks about possible future features of Clojure: different build profiles (like a lean version for Android), using logic programming to add language features like program analysis or predicate dispatch, an extensible reader, and multiple other topics. It's always interesting to hear Rich talk because he shows such a clarity of thought about language design issues.<p><i>Kevin Lynagh: Extending Javascript Libraries from ClojureScript</i> -- I thought this was the most immediately likeable talk. Other talks had deeper technical content but Kevin is an engaging speaker with an interesting topic.<p><i>Daniel Solano Gmez: Clojure and Android</i> -- Covers the speaker's original work to get Clojure to run and run performantly on Android and the Dalvik VM.<p><i>Mark McGranaghan: Logs as Data</i> -- Mark works at Heroku managing the system to log and analyze the huge number of events occurring on that platform. He makes a compelling case that using data structures (like the ones in Clojure) are much more powerful way to store log data than the traditional text file format.<p><i>Neal Ford: Master Plan for Clojure Enterprise Mindshare Domination</i> -- Neal works for a company that surveys new technologies and make technology recommendations to enterprise companies. That puts him in a very good position to give this clear talk on how languages/technologies become popular in the enterprise and how to advance that process.<p><i>Daniel Spiewak: Extreme Cleverness: Functional Data Structures in Scala</i> -- The least boring talk on data structures you'll ever hear. This guy really does have energy (to point that I found his pacing distracting, but his speaking made up for it). The title says in Scala but really these are largely the same data structures and concepts used in Clojure. Most Clojurists probably know about persistent data structures and structural sharing by now, but if you don't this is a good intro.<p><i>Michael Fogus: The Macronomicon</i> -- A very clear discussion of macros. Most of what I've seen and read about macros has been very theoretical, but here they're presented as just another interesting tool for a practicing programmer. This talk isn't really about how, but more why and where to use macros.<p><i>Ambrose Bonnaire-Sergeant: Introduction to Logic Programming with Clojure</i> -- An accessible introduction to logic programming and some interesting examples in 40 minutes.<p>Almost all the other talks are good too.

The way these guys operate is that they often load balance their charges over many merchant accounts.<p>Your merchant account can get into trouble if you have too many chargebacks <i>and</i> have too high a percentage of chargebacks. So the way most people do it is try and stay under the hard limit. The percentage is still too high but as long as you stay under the hard limit you'll be fine. If you know you're going to bust that merchant account that month you pump as much of your transactions through and close the account before the chargebacks inevitably pour in leaving the issuing bank on the hook. I can't remember which of Visa or Mastercard gave more leeway but the numbers were something like 35 max chargebacks/month and under 2% of total transactions and the other 50 max chargebacks and under 2.5% of total transactions. The numbers may not be exact but they should reasonably close.<p>It's actually very easy to get a merchant account. You set up a dummy corporation, get a legitimate-looking website and request one.

Sure, Amazon is doing great (80B+) and is taking some of their business, but eBay is still a cash machine.<p>4) Looking at Indigogo it says that if you raise the money the fee is 4%.  If you don't raise your goal the fee is 9%.  While the 4% is better than 5%, my guess is that the total expected fee is actually above 5%.<p>6) Crowdfunding is not as simplistic as it appears on the surface.  While not having the funding as an investment gets around many of the issues associated with the Securities and Exchange Commission, making a mistake could land an owner in jail or with substantial fines.

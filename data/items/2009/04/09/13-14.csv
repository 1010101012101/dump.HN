554352,comment,554166,554166,0,0,EliAndrewC,,,"One important difference between credit card buckets and marijuana legalization is that the latter can be done in increments. With credit card buckets, you'd have to produce a complete working system before it benefits a single person. With marijuana legalization, you can make relatively minor changes to the law with immediate benefits which don't have far-reaching repercussions.<p>For example, the federal government can stop making raids on places that provide medical marijuana to cancer patients. Eric Holder has already announced this, and he's not even in favor of legalization. This has immediate benefit without interfering overly much with the other systems mentioned.<p>Also, many (though not all) of the issues described are state issues rather than federal ones. Whether you can smoke cigarettes in bars varies by locality, and presumably this would be the same for marijuana.<p>Ultimately, many of these issues would be decided by the courts rather than the legislature. We have a common law system that thrives on vague laws being interpreted and refined by rulings on specific instances of conflicts between different laws, principles, and common sense.<p>Obviously I'm hand-waving, and the essay is 100% correct about how difficult this would all be. I've thought about some of these issues before, but others were mentioned that had never occurred to me, and I don't have good answers for many of them.<p>Still, we can legalize incrementally, let states and localities handle the minutia, and allow the courts as always to hammer out a set of standards over time. This legalization a lot more doable than the impossible-once-you-really-think-about-it credit card buckets.",1239285255

Sweden recently passed a law that lets our government perform targeted mass surveillance and is in the process of passing data retention laws. Essentially our government are bullying its people into civil disobedience.<p>Now all the studies and polls I've seen in Sweden since the file sharing debate went mainstream a few years back is that people think file sharing for personal use is ok and my own anecdotal experience suggest it's no longer something you brush under the table it's something you do openly.<p>This is going on at the same time as the Cinemas in Sweden reported no loss in ticket sales between 1997-2007 (also consider this is the time when home cinema packages went mainstream) and SF the biggest cinema company reported record ticket sales for 2009. This is in a country where virtually everyone have access to at the least 24mbit DSL.<p>Personally I like going to the movies as does my friends, we see 3-10 movies a year even though we take no moral issue with piracy and don't mind watching movies on tiny 12"" laptop screens when we feel like it.

Ideally, we would be able to push the band gap anywhere we want, and we might be able to with specialized doping and electric fields, but at the moment we haven't been able to get outside of the IR spectrum (at least in Graphene, which I know a bit more about). There may be some fundamental material property limits that we are unable to get around (I don't think this is the case, but it could happen).<p>Because Silicon is similar to carbon, Silicon can do many of the things Carbon can. We know Silicon extremely, extremely well. We have been working out the kinks in it for 30 years, Intel has put billions of dollars into researching the material. We know how it works. Other materials fall off very quickly in our level of knowledge, we are still at the point in some of them that we know they work, but we don't know why. Carbon is getting a lot of attention, maybe because it's the next best step, or maybe because understanding Carbon will let us continue to push Silicon forward until years in the future when we have a better understanding of the material when we can transition nicely.<p>As for making heat -> You could, but the peak wavelength from the black body spectrum of the room would be about 10 microns. These solar cells are significantly shorter wavelength than that (they're absorbing ~1 micron radiation). Also, the longer the wavelength the less energy you get per photon, which wouldn't fare very well.<p>For heat to electricity, you need a TEG (thermoelectric generators, peltiers, something that uses the Seebeck effect) or a sterling engine of some kind. These work off temperature differentials. Unfortunately, thermodynamics is not nice about recouping energy, and they need high temperature differentials to function efficiently. Even then, the efficiency maxes at about 30% (Carnot efficiency for heat engines).",1351719572

You might expect that once it got past the opening book, where it plays by rote, it would start leaving pieces undefended, not capturing enemy pieces that are open.<p>That is not what happened.

The reason is simple--when it evaluated the board in order to formulate a plan to lose, IT ASSUMED THE OPPONENT WAS ALSO TRYING TO LOSE!<p>To win a game of chess where the goal of both players is to lose, what you are going to have to aim for is a position where you have such a strong position that you can force the opponent into a situation where you can check him, and to get out of check he is forced to checkmate you. In short, you have to completely dominate the opponent in order to ensure you will lose--and this means you have to play a really really good middle game.",1351718964

This actually isn't true in C++, because there could be many classes in scope that could take a list initializer like this. In Haskell, no literal with [] can ""turn into"" something besides a list, but that can happen in C++:<p><pre><code>    vector<int> items = {1,2,3,4};\n    int[] items       = {1,2,3,4};\n</code></pre>\nThese have different types, so how would C++ know which one you meant if you instead wrote:<p><pre><code>    auto items = {1,2,3,4};\n</code></pre>\nAgain, in Haskell this isn't a problem because literals have essentially a single type. (Edge cases around integers and strings notwithstanding).<p><i>Edit</i>: Just to clarify, in a Hindley-Milner system you could maybe get away with something like that, but everything you name in an HM system you must use, and that isn't the case in C++:<p><pre><code>    void foo() {\n      auto items = {1,2,3,4};\n      return;\n    }\n</code></pre>\nI can then make two classes with list constructors:<p><pre><code>    struct FooClass {\n      FooClass(std::initializer_list<int> list) {\n        cout << ""Made a Foo!"" << endl;\n      }\n    };\n\n    struct BarClass {\n      BarClass(std::initializer_list<int> list) {\n        format_your_hard_disk();\n      }\n    };\n</code></pre>\nObviously there are consequences to choosing the right type, but the type of that value never leaks out of the function. Nevertheless, because side-effects can happen anywhere, even in a constructor, C++ cannot optimize that out.<p>This might be a convoluted example, and it may be flawed, but conjuring up others is not hard and demonstrates that C++ simply cannot ever have true HM type inferencing. Since the ""real deal"" is not possible, the language is complex and the standard is large, I would not expect to be able to live without annotations in C++-land.

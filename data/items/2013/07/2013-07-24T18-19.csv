The best excuse I can muster is that I&#x27;m having a bad personal day, which is not much of an excuse.<p>I have in the past argued that Show HNs should get honest and open feedback, and not snarky stuff so here goes<p>1. &quot;Subscription Signing up and posting is free but to reply to job posts you must have a subscription.&quot;
 I was confused - I liked the idea of getting the early bird but this wording threw me - I could not work out if I would be able to reply to posts.  I nearly did not sign up because of it.<p>I suggest you add wording that &quot;The early bird will allow you to apply for jobs free for a year&quot; - at that point.<p>2. Try having two account type - company and jobseeker.  That might make the above issue clearer.  Also if I am a jobseeker why would I want to post a new job?  if jobseekers accounts can do that you may have some moderation to do.<p>3. suggest putting name boxes into profile - apparently more boxes to fill in less sign up.<p>4. overall - impressive, even your css is cache-busted.<p>Well, my opinion on the business model is really what started this mini flame, so here is a longer explanation of why I am not a total shit:<p>1. if these jobs are cross-posted anywhere, there is no convincing argument to pay your subscription fee.  I may as well apply to the ad that does not cost me 2.50 to apply.<p>2. Quality jobs on here is vital - if anyone can add them for the cost of an email, you will get spammed by idiots.  And I am afraid that if you are charging to post a job <i>and</i> charging to apply for a job, you will struggle to make critical mass.<p>Finally, and the reason for the grandparent post, I think that there are a number of &quot;industries&quot; that the Internet <i>should</i> have killed a while back but for some reason are still here.  Real Estate Agents (Realtors) being one, job searches being another.  Frankly anything that involves being an agent between two parties where those parties can find each other through structured searching is really going to be on its last legs.<p>I understand the desire (finding a job is broken, lets fix it) - but honestly I do not think that another agency approach is the long term solution - and as such I would suggest the OP thinks long and hard as to whether the game they are playing has a positive end in sight.<p>The pond is shrinking, you clearly have the chops for this, try finding a pond that is growing.<p>(yeah easy to say I know)",1374691972

Having worked with hundreds of companies over the past couple of years, we&#x27;ve learned that shared accounts are ubiquitous, specially for infrastructure accounts (if your company uses SSH, chances are you have one Unix Login that all your admins/employees share). Which makes non-repudiation harder.<p>I&#x27;ve seen this first hand at a number of large companies for both unix accounts and (even more so) with database accounts. After some period of time (varies from 1 month to 1 year) everybody who worked on an application would have the database credentials of the application and would use them to diagnose app issues. New members of the team for an app would be given all the credentials too as &quot;it&#x27;s the only way to get things done...&quot;.<p>It wouldn&#x27;t start out that way as things would be &quot;locked down&quot; at first but <i>every</i> app ended up like that. Add to this that folks tend not to ever rotate their application database passwords for fear of breaking something and you&#x27;ve got a ton of people with the same access credentials and no way to distinguish them. People would join/leave the group (or even the company) that managed an app and would forever have access to all the databases for the app[1].<p>This is one of the problems that we&#x27;re solving with JackDB[2](<i>disclosure: I&#x27;m the founder</i>). It allows you to share data sources without sharing passwords. User&#x27;s authenticate as themselves and the server proxies the database connection for them. All executed commands (SQL, etc) are added to an audit trail and since you can tie actions to actual users you know who made changes, who queried customer records etc. Similarly since access is done <i>per user</i> you can selectively grant/revoke access to user&#x27;s without asking them to &quot;forget&quot; old credentials.<p>[1]: Yes firewalls can block things as well but if you&#x27;re still an employee somewhere then you can probably get passed the internal firewall by tunneling through some other server you have access to.<p>[2]: <a href=""http://www.jackdb.com/home.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.jackdb.com/home.html</a>",1374689573

They either rent from a flying club or partnership, or own a cheap cessna 150/172 or homebuilt. You can buy a decent buck 50 for about $20k, which doesn&#x27;t make you rich if you own one. The average HN programmer earns $150k+ if they work at Microsoft (like you), Google or facebook in silicon valley. That&#x27;s fairly rich, and it&#x27;s a bit hypocritical of you to be calling me rich when my income for the past few years has been around $40k. I used to earn over 100k 15 years ago, but I chose lifestyle over stress and being rich.<p>I pay $50/hr dry to fly a friend&#x27;s plane, and he&#x27;s not rich. He is retired and never earned much money during his career. He can only afford to own a plane because he was left money by his father, and also because his wife has a good pension. He absolutely loves flying, so that is what he has decided to spend his retirement money on. He drives a falling-apart car from the early 90s.<p>Getting back to the discussion: the high compression engines that run avgas tend to be in light twins, which are mostly used to train airline pilots, air-taxis, medevac, etc. There certainly are some rich people with high performance piston planes, but that is probably a minority. At the moment there simply isn&#x27;t any viable engine replacement for these planes. AOPA is actually working hard with industry groups to find a drop-in replacement for avgas, which will work in all these engines. It&#x27;s not an easy thing to do, as you have to make sure the new fuel isn&#x27;t going to damage the engine, cause an engine failure, etc.<p>Perhaps they should have started looking for a replacement earlier. Part of the problem is that there isn&#x27;t too much innovation in aircraft engines, in order to avoid possible problems and because it&#x27;s very expensive to develop (and aircraft sales are a few orders of magnitude lower than car sales). Even new aircraft piston engines don&#x27;t tend to have ECU/FADECs (or even electronic timing).",1374689387

The whole anti-copyleft thing did not start until recently, because of increased resistance from companies like Apple who have an active anti-freedom political agenda.<p>The simple act of refusing to use proprietary software does not give users freedom in software, it just prevents them from being subjugated by that one particular piece of proprietary software. Copyleft is also not necessary to have freedom, but it is pragmatic in that it leverages copyright in an attempt to further the political goal of freedom.

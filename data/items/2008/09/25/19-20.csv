(jk - the speed is fine btw). The thing that needs most attention (imho) is the design, whilst there are good things (the layout of the search results, especially of 'wide' keywords like 'ruby' or 'augustus') I'm less of a fan of the use of red - in design terms red is an emotive, passionate colour, I would recommend perhaps a blue which usually represents safety, security and trust (look at bank colour schemes). You might alos consider green or grey. The red sets me on edge. Love the use of larger fonts sizes, excellent - should be popular with the age > 25 crowd.<p>All in all very impressed, I wish you the very best of luck and have bookmarked and will continue to use.

Of course, my dad's a physicist who hacks Matlab & FORTRAN all day, so I may have grown up with a different interpretation of all this.<p>The wonderful thing about programming is that the computer is an honest mirror.  If you screwed something up, you'll know.  It won't spare your feelings or let you delude yourself into thinking it's working (well, within reason -- eventually you learn to write good tests).<p>In a world with so much bullshit, it's pretty nice.  While growing up, it's a great anchor of simple reality in a volatile time in your life.<p>As for other questions as ""does it make you into a loser"" or ""is it a life-long cockblock?"" the answer's simple: it's fairly unrelated.  If you're a true loser, you'll just be a computer loser.  Ditto for the cockblock.<p>OTOH, you'll notice that there percentage of college-educated men has been dropping recently, while the opposite has been occurring for women.  Which means a certain tolerance to loserness is building to help against that self-cockblock threshold.<p>Maybe 5-10 years ago it was a problem, but in my generation (I'm 29), everyone's using a computer almost all day long.  The only difference is that it's my job directly, while others have other jobs using the computer.  Gaming is deeply mainstream now (esp. in men in my age group & younger), and programming's just a good sign of intelligence in this group.<p>Look, here's what you do:<p>1. Hit the fucking gym.  It's really not hard.  Usually single programmers have lots of disposable income.  Instead of buying that new Amiga motherboard you've been salivating over, spend some cash on looking hot.  Experiment with it like you would any other problem: maybe a trainer, different exercises, buy some books on it, maybe some equipment, whatever.  You've got the CPU for this, and this really is a simple problem that's usually solved if you can get off the terminal for an hour or so every other day (and you can, just schedule your gentoo builds).<p>2. Drink water and/or diet soda while hacking.  It's the cheap sugar calories in regular soda that give programmers the ""fat loser"" stigma.<p>3. Don't wear the free t-shirts you get at social events.  Actually spend money on what you wear and research what looks good & bad.  For men, fashion is dumb-fuck-simple.  If you don't know, just read ""Dressing the Man"" and only do 1/10th of what it says.<p>4. Have other non-computer-geek things in your life.  Somewhere that'll let people connect with you somehow.  Politics, music, sports, whatever.<p>With that, you're a good-looking, intelligent, well-paid guy.  Suddenly you can be a complete jackass and still get laid pretty often.  Just, you know, don't start singing to yourself & rocking in your seat when a girl approaches you.<p>Sorry for the preaching, but when I hear the same seemingly easy-to-solve complaints over & over, I kinda have to get this way.",1222370511

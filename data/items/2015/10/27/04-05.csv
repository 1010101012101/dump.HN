10456375,comment,10455681,10455681,0,0,n00b101,,,"Very thought provoking. It seems like a good argument in favour of entrepreneurship and risk taking.<p>But I&#x27;m not sure that I agree with Taleb&#x27;s glorification of Front Office banking roles in sales & trading. Like any sufficiently highly paid corporate employee, traders are compensated mainly through company shares which vest over a long period of time. These days a trader&#x27;s bonus can even be clawed back, many years after being awarded. Rumour is that Wall St traders are often caught up in a culture of excess where bosses pressure them to spend/live extravagantly and become completely dependent on annual cash bonuses. For all the supposed risk taking tolerance bravado, traders are merely risking the firm&#x27;s capital and not their own. In some ways it is similar to the expat role - just as some executives are chosen to be expats, some bank employees are chosen as traders and given enormous amounts of the firm&#x27;s capital to bet with. No one can say what to look for in hiring a good trader, there is no consistent basis for selection, there are no academic or professional credentials for traders, the bank executives can choose to shutdown a particular trading desk on a whim, the worst fear of a trader is to lose this coveted position, and most people do not last very long as traders as their luck runs out eventually at the poker table. If an expat executive is like a diplomat fearfully being assigned from one foreign posting to the next, then I think a trader is like a gambler-slave sent to gamble with his master&#x27;s money in the casino and he is in constant fear of the dire consequences that await if and when he loses too great a sum or fails to win large sums frequently. Trading jobs are usually a better deal for the employee than most comparable jobs, but it is still an employee job and it attracts exactly the kind of people who go to business school and actively seek low risk careers and dependence on a paycheque written by a prestigious employer.",1445921634

The question is how we best make that happen (more).  I think helping more local communities have more places to work/buy/participate is going to be a bigger win than building more housing in the places the jobs already are.<p>People commute to San Francisco from Tracy.  From <i>Sacramento</i>.  Moving those people from Tracy to San Francisco cuts their commute.  It also means the demands of those people are now more expressed in San Francisco and less in Tracy.  That means fewer jobs available in Tracy and more jobs available in San Francisco; that means more demand for housing in San Francisco.",1445921612

I think the US at one point had interest developing a canal but work in Panama was seen as easier of the two isthmuses.<p>I think this will be a double edged sword for the locals.

10456370,comment,10453336,10456184,0,0,tsotha,,,">That doesn&#x27;t make very much sense to me. It&#x27;s not as if the &quot;new dollars&quot; are worth $1.02, while the &quot;old dollars&quot; are worth $1.00.<p>It&#x27;s very much like that, actually, except it&#x27;s more like the new dollars are worth $1.00 and the old ones are now worth $0.98.  The important factor is time.  Suppose we live on an island and have a currency we&#x27;ll call a &quot;foo&quot;.  There are 100 foos in circulation.  Tax collection isn&#x27;t what it should be, so the president of the island borrows ten foos from the central bank (which, like the fed, just updates the computer to create them) and uses them to pay the presidential guard.<p>When he spends those ten extra foos, the president is getting the current purchasing power of the foo.  It will take some time for the value of each foo to adjust down to take into account there are now 110 foos instead of just 100.  Two weeks from now everything priced in foos will have risen 10%, but since the economy didn&#x27;t &quot;know&quot; about the extra foos the president was able to spend them at full value.<p>>The first-order effect is: banks are owed an amount of money denominated in nominal terms, and inflation will decrease the value of those debts.<p>That&#x27;s true, but the bank isn&#x27;t going to loan you money without taking inflation into account.  That&#x27;s why loan interest rates go up when inflation goes up.<p>Also, the bank is borrowing the money they&#x27;re loaning to you, and after they make the loan they&#x27;re going to sell it off to a GSE or market investors.  So someone else is ultimately holding the bag if there&#x27;s inflation.<p>>And even if this theory was true, inflation has been historically low (and below central-bank targets) for quite a few years, so whoever is pushing for higher inflation isn&#x27;t very good at it.<p>Well, yes.  The problem is two-fold.  The first part is in a fractional reserve system the money supply depends on qualified candidates willing to borrow.  In the midst of a recession there just aren&#x27;t as many of them - people without jobs aren&#x27;t buying houses, and businesses aren&#x27;t expanding.  So less new money is created.<p>The second part is loan defaults destroy money.  If you get enough defaults you&#x27;re going to get deflation.<p>It&#x27;s not like the banks didn&#x27;t get their money&#x27;s worth, though, as the government used every trick in the book to add money to the economy.  At one point in time the government was borrowing forty cents of every dollar it spent, and the Fed was injecting more directly though QE.",1445921547

I&#x27;ve done my fair share of automation, and very often people underestimate the amount of work required to bring a script to the level of an human (which is normal! You&#x27;re the person who wrote the script after all). Your script is most likely going to be 30% to 50% as productive as a normal person, at least in the beginning.<p>Another thing to keep in mind is that there&#x27;s a lot of work that can&#x27;t be automated. These people may have domain-specific knowledge that you don&#x27;t have. Very often domain experts take decisions which look like guesses but aren&#x27;t.<p>What I would do in your place would be to redesign your program to be a tool to supplement humans. You could sell it as such to your higher-ups, and help some of those people keep their jobs.<p>Also note that it&#x27;s somewhat unlikely to have a massive lay-off happen. Most people will get reaffected to another role or a slightly different mission. Managers don&#x27;t like shrinking headcount.<p>Finally, don&#x27;t forget to take credit for this. You&#x27;ve been toiling on this for months after all, on your own. You deserve credit for it.",1445921520

At first it is reported that there are 10 deaths, but a few hours later it&#x27;s reported that there are 100 deaths, and then 99 deaths. So imagine we are writing an article for a newspaper, or even a Wikipedia article. The reporter or contributors are trying to find out the truth, because their objective is to create &quot;the perfect article&quot;. So when the later death toll comes in they will often rewrite the original article to make it correct, but in doing so they hide the original reporting. The reader will see an article that says: Plane crash: 99 dead.<p>Newspapers don&#x27;t print feeds, there&#x27;s no room.

I&#x27;ll probably get bored after a few of these, but... whatever.<p>Charge 1 - Leigh Alexander stands accused of writing an article that GG disagree with, and that many of them inexplicably interpreted as some kind of threat, or something. I don&#x27;t know. The article was basically about how video games have become mainstream, the concept of a &quot;gamer&quot; demographic is largely meaningless, and developers and publishers need not, and should not, solely target everything at this narrow demographic.<p>Charge 2 - She is accused of talking to her colleagues, possibly at other publications. She may have engaged in such crimes as discussing her work with others, and building a network of contacts. Y&#x27;know... journalism. Because apparently all journalism must be done in a vacuum.<p>Charge 3 - She is accused to also doing other work, and talking about that other work on her personal social media accounts. Even though there&#x27;s no evidence that she&#x27;s done anything wrong as a journalist, she totally could have if she wanted to, and therefore can&#x27;t be trusted, or something?<p>At this point, I&#x27;m just bored.

I&#x27;m a programmer at a startup. I use very little of any knowledge I acquired at school on a daily basis. Graphics? Compilers? Advanced algorithms? Nope. I just need to solve relatively simple problems and write code that&#x27;s maintainable. The second part you don&#x27;t learn in school - in fact, you probably learn the opposite. The first part requires a bit of a shift in thinking if you&#x27;ve never programmed before.. Hence bootcamps. I&#x27;m not deluded into thinking I&#x27;m really that much more capable <i>at doing my job</i> than someone who spent less time learning not-so-practical things. Obviously this depends on what you&#x27;re doing - bootcampers can&#x27;t just go be machine learning experts. But web devs? Of course.<p>I&#x27;ve interviewed people from 4 year programs, and I&#x27;ve interviewed bootcampers. My guesses on their respective resumes pretty much matched up with how I graded them on their interviews. In both groups, you have the people who get it, and the people who don&#x27;t. Obviously, the percentage was higher in the CS education group than the bootcamp group. But there are some really good bootcampers. There&#x27;s also lazy fucks (get-rich-schemers) in both crowds. And I can tell the difference pretty easily in resumes.<p>It&#x27;s fine that you have that heuristic - if you&#x27;re running a tight ship and can&#x27;t afford the time, then that makes sense.

I accumulated a lot of scripts, to the point where they were the first set of tools I would reach.<p>But it becomes a self-renforcing loop: the more you rely on this toolbox, the more problems you create that are best solved with the same tools and the particular mindset they promote. But for work-related tasks, throwaway code rarely is: your code becomes part of your infrastructure and you have to make it work reliably now and later.<p>After some years, things are not so fun anymore: assembling strings means escaping/quoting characters for different formats and languages. With shell scripts, the path of least resistance is unsafe and introduce many unneeded assumptions.<p>For example, in the above code, globbing in app/views/foo/... in the &quot;for&quot; expression will not work if you have spaces in file names. And if you can get it right, $file is not inside double-quotes; mv will erase any previously existing file. And even though some of the assumptions are valid in context, will they always hold?<p>In order to make them hold, people tend to adapt their problem to fit their tools, not the other way: file names are always in a well-known ascii range, with no space but a specific separator and zero-padding (e.g. myfile_00020, because files are sorted lexicographically). Unless you are willing to use json/xml tools, data is cut into pieces of strings: records are line-separated; each field is colon-separated, each subfield is comma-separated, etc (recursive CSV). And one day, that field which always contain dates in YY/DD/MM format (why not ISO-8601?) starts having a time too, formatted HH:MM. After a painful recovery of trashed data, you add &quot;just one more script&quot; to properly escape colons.<p>Languages are designed with specific goals in mind and writing complex programs is not what scripting languages are optimized for. \nI now prefer to use language with data-structures, functions, objects, namespaces: less use for strings and regexes. \nIf I try to write onto an existing file, I will be warned (or I can explicitely allow overwriting). Paths are organized as os-independant trees, etc: there are better interfaces to the facility provided by the OS. Coincidently, the need for scripts gradually reduced, at least the one I need to save (I still chain programs on the command-line).",1445919626

That HN job post is immortalized even more now.<p>But one interesting take-away it seems, not just for Homejoy, but for just about everyone in the market; the software is really bad. Not scheduling time to get from Point A to Point B - is that rocket science? If the customer support line is on fire, isn&#x27;t that when you start fixing the bug? Failing basic usability and billing is not an MVP for a $40m funded startup.<p>One thing I&#x27;ll say, is trying to own the experience, establish a heavy brand, and take a large cut means you have to be providing a valuable service in return to the contractor. For the on-demand economy, the way I think I would approach the problem is my customer is the service worker first, and their customer second.<p>These companies think about churn all wrong. The service provider is ultimately providing the service to the end-user, intentionally churning the end-user across different service providers is madness. You only win by making the service provider&#x27;s job more difficult? I don&#x27;t get it.<p>Obviously a lot of value in connecting a new household with a new service provider, whatever that service may be. Making that connection is a job well done and should be monetized at that time. If you can provide a new reliable <i>repeat</i> customer then that&#x27;s even more valuable to the service provider, and the startup who made the connection can in theory charge a higher price for those customers.",1445919024

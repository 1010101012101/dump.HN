IRS agents have done whatever they wanted to private citizens, with no consequences, for decades. Then they questioned (they <i>didn't</i> fine, prosecute, garnish, imprison, or confiscate) political groups that claimed to be educational groups, and as a result the agents got censured, fired, and prosecuted. The media and most people are too lazy to think through the inevitable consequences, but don't dream that the politicians are. Will political groups ever be investigated by the IRS again?",1370563170

Its false on so many levels, but people keep believing in it even after it has been found to be false every single time it has been said.<p>To take an example with wiretaps in US. First they said that any data found about innocent bystanders would be imminently destroyed. A few years later, they change the rules to keep it, but proclaimed that it was just 60 days. Years later, they put out a small press release and changed it to 5 months.<p>Or take the Swedish wiretap law. Politians and collumnist promised high and low that it would never, EVER, be used for anything but terrorism threats outside the national border. They said that anyone believing otherwise was tinfoil hats, and just misunderstood the issue. Before a year had passed, the secret police (for internal security) was granted an exception. A few months later, government politicians got an exception. At the same time, the police got an exception to target serious crime. A few months further down, and it was talks about using the data for our version of IRS.<p>Yes, never ever indeed.",1370563145

The nature of technology in general, and the internet in particular, involves the co-mingling of property on the site of some 3rd party for the benefit of all.</i><p>Agreed. It's a strange position to take that because it's technically possible for the government to access the information (owed to the location of the data), then they should be allowed to do so. This could be used to rationalize virtually unlimited access to otherwise private communications in today's hyper-connected world.<p>But, capabilities that we have had in the past (e.g. wiretapping) have always been checked in order to preserve privacy (or, put more Constitutionally, protect us from unreasonable search and seizure). Phone calls have always involved third-party transmission by the telcos. Why is that different from data sitting on a third-party server?<p>In general, however, it becomes silly to argue what should be permissible based on the ancillary nuances of technical architecture. It's a bit of a red-herring. The real question is ""what is the intent of the protections afforded by the Constitution and are we upholding that intent"". To argue that ""the government should have a particular right because there's a client-server architecture involved vs. P2P"" is spurious in this context.",1370563079

5836113,comment,5835866,5835866,29,0,GabrielF00,,,"I don't agree. The traditional news outlet that broke this story (The Guardian) has a lot of advantages over WikiLeaks. It has experienced reporters who understand the issues involved. It has a well-known and respected editorial process that can weigh the consequences of a leak versus the potential value to the public. It has a process through which the public can contact the organization and correct errors. When WikiLeaks put out the cables I noticed that there was one cable where they redacted the names of people who had met with US diplomats from the body of the document but not from the title of the document. I looked very hard for any way to contact WikiLeaks to get the matter fixed and found nothing - their website suggested that people interested in providing feedback contact human rights organizations or a couple of law firms in the UK. On the other hand, traditional journalists typically post their email addresses and twitter handles and will often respond to queries.<p>Yes, the administration is aggressively challenging leakers, but newspapers have a long, successful history of defending their first amendment rights in the courts. Nor is it clear that a UK-based newspaper such as The Guardian would be subject to Justice Department subpoena's or prosecution.<p>WikiLeaks, particularly under Julian Assange, has demonstrated a complete lack of transparency and biased reporting (c.f. the Collateral Murder video).

Point taken, I wasn't entirely clear about that.  I was speaking in the context of the discussion, which was about the set of exchanges in which fallacies are brought up.  This is basically the realm of policy debate and empirical claims.<p>It is <i>there</i> that I claim you shouldn't be invoking fallacies only applicable to deductive reasoning, because there are almost never situations where the crucial issue hinges on a disagreement about a deduction.<p>>Deductive implication isn't equivalent to having an ""infinite likelihood ratio"". ...<p>It's not clear you are using the term correctly.  I mean this value:<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayes_factor"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayes_factor</a><p>Saying that a piece of evidence <i>necessarily</i> entails a conclusion is indeed equivalent to an infinite (as much as the term is meaningful) likelihood ratio, as that is what is necessary to make your confidence in the conclusion equal to 100% and thus reduce to the case of Aristotelian deductive logic.  (Probabilistic inference is such logic generalized to the cover uncertainty.)<p>>Well, yeah, real world evidence is prior to a deductive argument, not part of it; insofar as it contributes to a deductive argument, it does so as part of an inductive justification for the premises of a deductive argument.<p>As above, that ""deductive argument"" generally is not going to be a deduction.  Your induction-based premise is only going to get you e.g. ""this policy <i>probably</i> will save money in the long run"", which means your supposedly deductive continuation is tainted with the same uncertainty.<p>To the extent that there is a pure syllogism in there (""we should do that that will probably save money; this will probably save money; therefore we should do that"") <i>the debate is rarely about its validity</i>, but rather, about the degree to which those things really all probable.  And in that case, the fact that experts are sometimes wrong is not a reason to reject the evidential value of their opinions.  (Like I said the first time around.)<p>>You didn't warn against using the appeal to authority fallacy, you endorsed (not ""warned against) using something you called the ""the appeal to authority fallacy"",<p>I most certainly did warn against using ""appeal to authority is a fallacy"" to ignore the evidential value of exper opinions; read the comment again.  That is how fallacy invokers use it <i>in practice</i>, and why it is, well, bad reasoning.<p>>and then defined that as something that is not what the ""appeal to authority fallacy"" actually refers to.<p>Not if your own words are to be believed: you said the real ""appeal to authority fallacy"" was an OR of three situations, the last of which was exactly what I said it was: the notion that authorities are only probabilistic evidence.  My point is that it's called a fallacy <i>despite the authority only being used as probabilistic evidence in the first place!</i><p>>> And that you generally endorse (the genuine fallacy of) rejecting evidence simply because it doesn't guarantee a conclusion.<p>>No, I don't, and nothing in my post stated that, or supports your claim that I endorse that. That's just something you invented.<p>Yes you did: you claimed that the debates we're referring to crucially involve deductive rather than inductive logic.  You claimed that the appeal to authority fallacy is relevant.  But it's only relelvant to deductive claims thereon, which means that all of its invocations in this context are invalid arguments -- nobody is trying to claim that the authorities' endorsement <i>guarantees</i> the conclusion.",1370562279

In a week visit to Toronto, I had twenty five interviews.<p>And salary is like night and day. The highest PHP salary I heard of out there in my interviews and travels was 55k. Toronto PHP jobs start at 60k and many are in the 70's and 80's. I've heard an even larger gulf for Java devs, especialy as you get up to the senior ranks. I don't know about salarys for other languages, but if you don't know Java, .Net, or PHP in the maritimes, you'll be waiting a long time to be employed. There's the occasional C++ or Python gig, but youd' make twice as much in Toronto.<p>And remote jobs, in Canada, in my experience, do not exist. I've seen maybe five in the last five years. Meanwhile I see remote gigs in the States daily. Basically if your'e looking for remote work, you're looking in the US. Canadian employers I've found are leery to openly hostile about folks working remotely.<p>Now things could have changed in the last year, and that's just my own experience, but if your'e looking for solid work, and good pay, and in Canada, it's effectively Toronto or bust.",1370561698

Among the first things they did on obtaining legislative control in late 1994 was start work on rewriting  immigration law - resulting legislation so draconian that experienced criminal lawyers are often floored by its provisions when they have occasion to study it.<p>For example, an alien with a criminal record who is unable to prove their right to be present in the US on the spot can be detained incommunicado for <i>six months</i> before being entitled to any kind of hearing. This is a step forward; until a few months ago, the government was able to detain said alien <i>indefinitely</i>: <a href=""http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=972155883341975337&hl=en&as_sdt=2&as_vis=1&oi=scholarr"" rel=""nofollow"">http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=9721558833419753...</a><p>Bear in mind that the President is sworn to uphold the laws as they are, even when he disagrees with them; his powers are far more circumscribed by Congress than most people appreciate, viz. Obama's oft-repeated desire to close Guantanamo, which has gone nowhere because Congress won't authorize funds for setting up detention facilities on the mainland. It's not so much the case that Obama wants to know who you were calling last Tuesday as that he's supposed to maximize the government's <i>legislated</i> powers to defend the US from attack. If he ordered the NSA to suspend this sort of intelligence-gathering and subsequently a terrorist attack took place that could supposedly have been prevented, he'd be impeached.

5835956,comment,5831491,5831491,69,0,nilkn,,,"Oh boy, I have a lot of comments here, most of them in agreement with the article but not all.<p>According to all the anecdotal knowledge I have, my conclusion has been that currently software engineering and chemical engineering are tied for the locally optimal career choice for those with a four year degree or less. While some college graduates (or dropouts) will go become billionaires, as a general rule, it is quite hard to do better in a career without further education than you can with these two types of engineering.<p>Software and chemical engineering also both have their own ""meccas"": SV for software, Houston for chemical. Google/Facebook/etc. for software, Exxon/Chevron/etc. for chemical.<p>That said, anyone who thinks software developers are on the verge of being overpaid should consider how low developers (and most workers) are on the overall wage ladder. Maybe $150k sounds high to the typical person born and raised in the middle class, but that's pennies compared to the typical salaries in the true upper class. Moreover, the majority of developers making salaries around that number live in the most expensive cities in the country, not the cheaper ones.<p>As a general rule, software developers are in the middle class or upper middle class, but not the upper class. Of course, it depends on your definition of the various social classes. If you define it as the one percent, you'd need to make about $350k. If you define it as those whose primary income derives from investments rather than salaries, then even that is not nearly enough.<p>What's an example of something close to an ""upper class career""? Some but certainly not all doctors would make it. Family physicians wouldn't be close (they're about the same as engineers in the end), but specialized academic surgeons will make $500k-$1M/year. At many universities with medical schools, the top surgical faculty will make about double the president of the university.<p>A successful trader of financial assets can make seven figures. This is almost common on Wall Street, but it happens elsewhere. The youngest billionaire in Houston right now made his fortune from Enron: he was a trader of energy derivatives and after making the company some $75 million one year he was awarded about an $8M bonus. He then started his own energy trading firm and went on to make a few billion.<p>A partner at McKinsey, the management consulting firm, will make seven figures in total compensation. A partner at any major law firm will make the same.<p>These aren't extraordinarily difficult careers to get into. Becoming a surgeon is mostly about planning ahead and dedication. Becoming a partner at a firm is just about putting in the hours for years. Literally anybody on Wall Street will make $100k minimum unless they're like a receptionist, and from there you can work your way onto the trading floor.<p>And let's not even talk about top business executives, who put all those salaries to shame. And contrary to popular belief there is a reasonably effective method towards becoming such an executive: Harvard/Wharton MBA, consultant at McKinsey, eventually hired by a company you consulted for. That's how Skilling got on as CEO of Enron. That's how my friend's dad, a CEO making $4M/year, got his job. Etc. There are tons of examples of it.<p>It happens all the time. Most people just don't know about it. Many people often think it's all luck getting into the upper ranks of the executives, but that's because they think it's done by choosing a company at a young age and working there for 20+ years. That's not how it's done in general. It happens occasionally, but you have to network your ass off for decades to make that work. But if you're a consultant, then you'll be hired by the top executives to help them solve problems. You just skipped all the lower ranks thanks to just a few years of business school. (This doesn't work with an MBA from anywhere but the most prestigious schools.)<p>In short, there are a number of careers where at your peak you'll make not a six figure salary but a <i>seven</i> figure salary. If you think back to how long the phrase ""six figure salary"" has been in use, you'll realize that, with inflation, a seven figure salary is quite accurately the new six figure salary in expensive cities like SF and NYC. People in these cities who aren't making such a salary are often willfully ignorant of this fact. They want the prestige of a ""six figure salary,"" even though their buying power is an order of magnitude less than what that phrase originally referred to.",1370561169

Why not?  These tools exist for the bigger fish: the dozens of Soviet-era nuclear weapons believed to be missing, or the small amounts of  dangerous pathogens that periodically vanish from research labs.  These are what the government is worried about, and they're not going to risk revealing their methods for something lesser.<p>Warren Buffet has predicted a major nuclear terrorist attack on an American city to be a ""virtual certainty"" given enough time.<p>Ok, but no one here is going to argue that stopping <i>terrorism</i> is bad: the problem is in how we define terrorism.  What happens when the definition becomes progressively wider?  What counts as ""terrorism"" is political, after all.<p>It's important to remember that we still have a functioning democracy.  If you -- Hacker News reader -- decided to run for congress tomorrow, you might not win, but you won't be killed, sabotaged, or secretly blocked.  While some individual politicans may be corrupt, the system broadly is not.  These programs are enforcement mechanisms; the laws themselves are still made by the people, and maybe corporations.  While we as a population may argue about social issues like gay marriage and abortion, our government is not fascist.<p>Further, I take these programs as a great example that security is much harder to create than it is to destroy.  Extreme efforts such as these may still be insufficient to prevent New York from being destroyed by terrorists.  In that case, the acts of a few crazy people still overcame a monumental effort by the entire intelligence apparatus.  What does that say about the time Hacker News is so afraid of, when it's more than only a few crazy people that the government is ""worried about""?<p>Should these programs exist?  I don't know.

I might be willing to accept a risk of periodic car bombs, which while tragic are not statistically significant; however, if PRISM is actually effective at tracing and intercepting Soviet nuclear weapons, I can see multiple sides of this issue.<p>We have rights to privacy and protection from unreasonable search and seizure.

If you're the one who wants to change someone's mind, then you're the one who has to engage on grounds they're going to find persuasive. The buyer; <i>the person who wants something</i>; pays - in discussion as much as in any other area of life. What are you shared objectives? What do you stand to lose if you don't change your mind? What do you stand to gain if you do?<p>Complaining about the standard of dialogue seems likely to be unproductive. Sceptics have been doing that with regard to Christians for years and it doesn't really seem to have gotten them anywhere - there's little incentive.<p>So, that in mind, it seems that you'd do better working the argument in the author's piece in reverse:
Someone tries to appeal to emotion, gets a logical fallacy claim back in return. If you assume that there are many different types of speech, and that you're not really in a logical argument, then what does that tell you about <i>them?</i><p>Well, the first thing it tells you is that that person cares very strongly about a consistency principle - or at least the outward appearance of one - that they probably want to appear reasonable. What can you think of that's likely to be in their personal life that they're going to feel the same way as you do that a consistency principle is going to work in favour of?<p>What's the obvious pickup with a lot of sexism? 'Would you want someone talking like that to your mother or sister?'<p>Of course, that sort of pattern - consistency response to an emotional appeal - is going to come up in areas where people just don't care about very much other than appearing reasonable fairly frequently. I seem to recall one description of debating with Christians that went something along the line of 'Making fun of born-again Christians is like hunting dairy-cows with high-powered sniper rifles.'<p>We all get a cheap laugh from it, probably, but is hunting dairy cows really a productive activity for a smart person? IME people with stuff to do don't spend a lot of time on such things - it seems unlikely that scepticism would be a large part of their identity.<p>#<p>However, If you're getting that response a lot wherever you go, maybe the problem's you.<p>#<p>A good example of this is, in fact, that piece above. What's the <i>actual</i> prevalence of people being unreasonably called out on logical fallacies? I've not seen it a lot. That may just be because I'm one of the people who does it and most of us seem to tend to appear reasonable from the inside. But equally it may be because the prevalence is actually low. So, the basic premise on which the author is attempting to appeal, the supposed shared experience? I'm not going to find that convincing on an emotional level or a consistency based one.",1370560605

The web is like people communicating with mail instead of using real time telephone conversations. It's very inefficient.

Wuala/SpiderOak are fine too, but kind of suck for non-security reasons in my limited experience with them, compared to Dropbox or AeroFS.  (I personally just use rsync and NFS over VPN, though.)<p>The problem is mobile.  Due to some questionable decisions made by especially Apple but also earlier with Google, you really need every single app to write to your cloud storage provider's API.  Dropbox is unquestionably the leader there; iCloud on iOS seems to do ok for newer apps.  Neither provides meaningful encryption.  Requiring every app developer to figure out encryption and manage keys on his own and then handle that on top of the Dropbox API is <i>also</i> insane.<p>Arguably Apple has a lot of ways to pwn iOS users already, so I'd consider trusting Apple and iCloud to not be <i>that</i> much <i>worse</i> than just trusting iOS, but it is still bad (and most of the bad things Apple can do to you either involve signing bad things, then requiring an active step by the user or MITM,  or doing things like retaining device keys at manufacture time and subsequently seizing the devices, or having some deeply-buried backdoors which probably require physical access or are exceedingly infrequently used.)<p>There's really no good solution for mobile now.  You could probably build something fairly non-shitty in the Android world, although I don't know enough about how applications share files and interoperate to know if it would need to be a per-user-app integration.  On non-jailbroken iOS, it's pretty clear you'd need to develop a new API which did client-side crypto, key management, etc., on top of file sharing.  It would be a pain, and even more of a pain if you wanted to avoid fully trusting Apple in the process.<p>The best solution right now is ""no data lives on the phone"", rather than trying to sync; use some kind of web or app which just uses transport crypto to interact with a server but never stores anything locally.  If you trust the OS a lot, you could do something like what Good Technologies does and try to sandbox your data within a specialized app like that.",1370560188

Bah.<p>I'm sorry, but anybody building an unmanned delivery system will have thought of that right away and dealt with it any number of ways. For instance, consider this scenario:<p>You order a pizza using an app on your phone. You get a text message ""the car is 5 minutes away from your address - please meet it outside. Your unlock code is 537."" You go outside. You get another text message ""the car is pulling up to your address now; your unlock code is 537."" You see a delivery van pull up and pause in front of your address. There is a well-marked door on the right side of the vehicle. The door is locked, but there is a keypad. You enter the code 537 (or alternately just wave your phone or credit card near the reader, authenticating with RFID or bluetooth. Or insert the card you used into a card reader.) and the door opens, your pizza boxes are revealed - one or more pizzas are dispensed like a stack of money showing up from a slot at an ATM. You take your pizza(s). The door automatically closes and the vehicle drives to the next delivery location.<p>If you don't show up on time, the car texts you once or twice more, waits for another 5 minutes or so, but eventually gives up and goes off to make the next delivery.<p>If some hoodlums show up first, they don't know the code and don't have the phone/credit card that was used to make the order, because they are not you and weren't told by you to pick up the pizza from the car. They cannot open the locked door so they cannot ""grab and go"" without defeating the physical security of the car, which would in all likelihood be stronger than would the physical security of a MANNED delivery vehicle. They could of course mug the recipient to get the pizza, but that's no different from mugging a delivery guy now.",1370559718

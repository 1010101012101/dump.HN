Sometimes automatic <i>escape analysis</i> can work when references escape, but not always.<p>Would you like the object to have its destructor called even though it might be still be accessible? What would happen if the program subsequently tries to access the object?<p>Most languages are naturally uncomfortable with tidying up some resoure while it still might referenced. For this reason languages prefer to leave it up to the programmer to explicitly manage destruction themselves.<p>A perfect example is C#'s <i>IDisposable</i> interface. The language obviously ""knows"" that a disposable object needs cleaning up after it is used - that's what <i>IDisposable</i> means - but it cannot work out when this should happen. So it lets the programmer decide when that actually happens. If a programmer wants destruction based on scope then she should use the <i>using</i> statement. If she wants destruction based on some other condition then that is possible too. The language cannot make this decision.<p>I hope that answers your question.",1325667563

I believe people with more time than money will always exist. SOPA may make piracy more difficult, but it's not going to stop it, just as killing napster didn't stop music piracy. Is it really going to create more jobs other than employing people to respond to the new SOPA takedown requests?<p>I think iTunes/Netflix/Rhapsody-type services are the right solution to this problem. Sure, a college kid can always pirate stuff for the sake of pirating or because they have no money, but most busy people that can afford to pay for it, as long as the asking price of the studios is not too egregious, they will usually pay it happily as long as it's easy. Simple paid options are the real solution here.",1325667245

In theory the puppet language is said to be ""not quite turing complete"" or ""mostly declarative"".<p>In reality there is no such difference. It's just a (poorly designed) programming language with domain-specific constraints. It <i>does</i> have all the concepts that give non-programmers headache: variables, classes, parametrizable classes, defines, inheritance, etc. And on top of that you better know your ruby, too, because you won't get away without writing custom types, resources and functions.

As I said, I have no evidence to suggest that I would command a significantly higher rate on a daily or weekly basis than I do now. However, not taking on any gigs that aren't really full time (but can be combined at my discretion with others that also aren't) would certainly have cost me money in the past.<p>I can see the argument for fixed price vs. T&M billing. I guess I just don't see why going as far as daily/weekly billing doesn't net a significant part of the downside (no hard limit on hours vs. compensation, no clear cut-off where clients have no claim on any work I do other than for their project) without necessarily netting much upside.<p>As I said,  perhaps that's the way the game happens to be played in whatever markets you've been working in. I'm certainly not saying you're wrong about your own situation.

For the rest you can use js as it is with it's actual language features which maybe a little verbose (my only lament so far) and prototypical based but you will begin to appreciate it in the long run. I don't like the exaggerated syntactic sugar that many libs bring in, that try to abstract and tuck away js as it is, making it pretend to be a class based language when it is not. That said, this particular lib's size and the direct problems it tries to solves are done so  elegantly. It's hard to ignore the good job the author has done!",1325664082

No computer has ever achieved this, until now. Eugene managed to convince 33% of the human judges that it was human.<p>Surely it depends on who the human judges are.  It seems a bit unfair that the judges normally have IQ > 100 and the other humans have IQ > 100.<p>I strongly suspect that some simplistic AI (alicebots, for example) would beat the Turing test if the human judges had IQ between 90 and 105.

Even if you think the NSA surveillance is unconstitutional, you have to concede that &quot;privacy&quot; is not a well-defined constitutional value. The framers spent many pages in the Federalist talking about the ins and outs of various voting systems, but never articulated a broader concept of privacy. The 4th amendment is based fundamentally on a &quot;property rights&quot; view: intended to keep the government from searching your property.<p>A perfect example is the recent case in Jones. Is it unconstitutional because putting a GPS tracker in a car enables 24/7 surveillance, or because it requires the police to physically trespass on the car to place the tracker?<p>The protection of &quot;privacy&quot; in the constitution has been extended to reach things birth control and abortion based on the &quot;penumbras&quot; of the rights that are actually in the text. This is fuzzy ground! You can believe that those penumbras exist yet still not believe they cover recording information people put out into the public internet.<p>In short, its not so much that Obama is well-placed to know how to work around the Constitution, its that he knows that digital privacy is on unsure Constitutional footing in the first place and is positioned to take advantage of where the lines are drawn.",1402235116

7864623,comment,7864397,7864594,2,0,danford,,,"> something more polished<p>What do you mean by this? IMO the last time I used EOS it was lacking in a lot of areas. This was only a few months ago.<p>Installation was fast and everything was automated, the install window had a &quot;drop-down&quot; terminal to watch processes, but nothing was there. I expected to be asked to re-size my partitions but never was. When I rebooted I noticed grub was a little borked, showing EOS, EOS recovery, Windows 7, and then about 30 or so entries of old kernels (I know I need to clean these up). It should have showed two more ubuntu OSs installed. I can still boot into my other two installations fine, I just had to do some guess work on what to pick in grub.<p>So I get into EOS and things are pretty cool, the thing I like best is the speed. Everything seems instant, well except the applications menu, it was a few milliseconds slower than anything else on the DE and that was annoying as I would often end up clicking it a second time causing it to open twice, which was kind of hard on the eyes. Coming from a Gnome 3 environment, I decided to change some things on the interface around to make it more like the gnome shell. Moved the launcher to the left, assigned the top left hot corner to show all windows, things were looking pretty good.<p>I tried using midori but the font rendering was just not worth it so I installed chromium, and of course that came with a lot of dependencies (around 300mb), so I tried to find out exactly how much space I had left on the partition (I some how  missed the partition editor in the install). I opened the file browser and really liked it. you could see how much space was being used by each partition with &quot;progress bars&quot;, but not by the EOS partition. There was no way to right click and select &quot;properties&quot; on the EOS partition, so I opened up the applications menu (twice) to find the &quot;system monitor&quot;, because on Ubuntu, the system monitor shows how much space you have. But the OS had no graphical system monitor. I&#x27;m sure top was installed, but it&#x27;s not the same. I was able to right click my home folder and select properties and this showed how much space I had on my partition.<p>Next I opened the terminal. I forget the name of the default terminal, but it wasn&#x27;t gnome-terminal. It was a very utilitarian terminal that had tabs and no menu bar. I couldn&#x27;t figure out how to change the look of it or get the tabs to go away.<p>Overall I give EOS a 5.9/10 It&#x27;s fast, but it lacks a lot of functionality I look for in an OS like this. Maybe I was expecting too much, but I feel it will be a long time before EOS is as robust and polished as Ubuntu. I realize that EOS is meant to be lighter than Ubuntu and use different programs, but at this point it&#x27;s just not ready to be my work horse.",1402234448

One troublesome point is the role democracy is playing in all this. This harks back to some earlier Chomsky ideas about &quot;Manufacturing Consent.&quot;<p>From my (removed, I am not American) perspective, it seems ridiculously obvious that terrorism is not anywhere near a big enough threat to justify the counter measures, loss of privacy , freedom and the threat of a scary totalitarian future. It&#x27;s like burning down every piece of wilderness on the continent to prevent deer-car collisions.<p>The war against an irrelevant tribal society on the Afghan-Pakistan border and the rise of a surveillance state in the US (and elsewhere) is connected by democracy.<p>A somewhat tangental notion is that this is just another inevitable consequence of digitisation. In the US I think a lot of the attention has been on the actual &#x27;surveillance&#x27; part. Some act which is similar to phone tapping, intercepting letters or rummaging through your drawers. Things like PRISM. This is the part that has a history of legislation related to it. The part that&#x27;s actually worrying in my opinion, is the aggregation and analysis.<p>Aggregating and storing data is the default behaviour of a digitised world, especially communications. I think I see a parallel between digital surveillance and file sharing. It&#x27;s a &quot;natural&quot; side effect of digitisation.<p>We need to worry about corporate surveillance as much as government and foreign government surveillance and I don&#x27;t think we can stop it.<p>The last time I went to Heathrow Airport I was thinking about those face recognition cameras logging you in and about of the country. The way they look screams techno dystopia. I was thinking about super HD panoramic cameras placed strategically around a city. I can easily imagine the tech being widely available. We could have several competing networks of Google Analytics for the physical world logging &quot;clicks&quot; every time a person walks enters a mall, walks down a street, drives under a bridge or gets picked up by a $99 GigaPan drone.<p>The line between our physical and digital lives is melting away. That means everything will be recorded and stored like emails. That inevitably leads to storage and aggregation, which means the end of privacy.<p>As something of a counterweight, Snowden&#x27;s whistle blowing is itself a consequence of these same forces. The reason this information could be aggregated, &quot;stolen&quot; and leaked is because it was digital.<p>Perhaps the end of privacy applies equally to those in power. Maybe we&#x27;ll get &quot;power exposed to sunlight&quot; that Chomsky wants.<p>In any case, Chomsky always seems like a caricature to me. He seems to think of these issues in political-legal terms. I think the NSA/Snowden story has a lot more to do with Google Analytics than Guantanamo Bay.<p>That&#x27;s a lot more worrying to me. Trying to shut down this kind of surveillance is like Disney trying to shut down BitTorrent, if Disney didn&#x27;t have any money.",1402234085

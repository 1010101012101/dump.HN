6636136,comment,6635315,6635610,10,0,gojomo,,,"Medicare is essentially single-payer for old people, yet it&#x27;s identified in the article as part of the problem. Like other government programs, it&#x27;s so much better at measuring inputs (amount spent and procedures performed) than outputs, that there&#x27;s an institutional bias in favor of overspending and overlooking corruption. (&quot;Oh, no, that&#x27;s not 10% more fraud and inefficiency this year, it&#x27;s reaching 10% more of the needy.&quot;)<p>There&#x27;s only one other sector of the US economy that&#x27;s &quot;single-payer&quot;: military procurement. And that&#x27;s not known for its spending efficiency, either.<p>So it&#x27;s not simply &quot;single-payer&quot; that magically saves money, but the specifics of the incentive system that&#x27;s set up, and the other precedents from American federal governance are not positive.<p>Thank you for acknowledging that the main mechanism that a federal medical buyer monopsony (aka nationalization/single-payer) could use for cost-control is, essentially, &quot;death panels&quot; who say no to many treatments currently performed.<p>But can the American political system embrace that step, or will it wind up with single-payer <i>without</i> cost-controls? We wind up with the kinds of giant federal programs that can make it through the political system, and get implemented by the bureaucracy... not the kinds of idealized programs existing only in advocates&#x27; minds.<p>Finally, in single-payer systems, getting &quot;whatever you want&quot; done &quot;at your own expense&quot; is often effectively prohibited. For example, when the official system has particular limits (like price controls, limited participating providers, or waiting lists) for a covered procedure, it has often been illegal, in US Medicare or Canada&#x27;s programs [1], to purchase that same procedure out-of-pocket/out-of-system for a negotiated price. Once you&#x27;ve nationalized, there&#x27;s even a certain logic to such prohibitions: the system is straining under budget caps, and you can&#x27;t risk the wealthy siphoning off capacity/copayments that could help support the common base.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.cato.org/publications/policy-analysis/freedom-"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cato.org/publications/policy-analysis/freedom-</a>",1383069302

There are a lot of people who live on very little there - many are artists, some are hermits, most are just plain poor as it is a difficult place to make a living. My family ranched there for several generations and we still spend vacation time in the area. The people that live there - and really, you could extrapolate this to much of middle america - are living for a lifestyle, not in pursuit of the almighty dollar. It&#x27;s pretty typical in Joseph to see a $50K pickup and $30K snowmobiles in front of a 40 year old single-wide trailer - whatever money they have goes into their &quot;toys.&quot; Is this existence better or worse than the urban &quot;keeping up with the Jones?&quot; Depends on what you want in life. But make no mistake about it, even someone who <i>chooses</i> to downgrade their wants and needs doesn&#x27;t automatically have life easy. There is already snow on the ground around Joseph and it won&#x27;t warm up again until about June. I&#x27;ve been snowed on there on the 4th of July. You could spend thousands just keeping yourself from freezing to death. The Oregon department of fish and wildlife has to deal with a lot of poachers - some because they feel entitled to a &quot;lifestyle&quot; but others, it&#x27;s probably pure survival. I see articles like this as mostly propaganda, trying to position the reality in which most americans live as a positive choice rather than the consequences of stagnate incomes, et al. We have shanty towns, hunger, malnutrition, unclean water - all the problems of the developing world - but they are perhaps less visible and/or effect a smaller number of the overall population in a visible way.",1383069246

I was told that if I didn&#x27;t get the surgery/pin then my toe wouldn&#x27;t heal properly and it could hurt for the rest of my life. I went to a second, more reputable doctor and he told me to just wear a boot for a week or two and start wearing shoes when the pain subsided. My toe is completely fine now and I have had zero problems. Since then I have definitely been wary of doctors.",1383069242

Battery life and performance for most of my setup is adequate; battery life is actually better than the air, but to be fair the air had less memory and often has 3+ JVM procs going. Type cover 2 is adequate for development, touch cover 2 does not seem click with me. The biggest shift is really trying to move into Windows for fun-dev (as opposed to corporate-dev). I miss spaces and still feel a gap between navigating iterm2 against darwin and conemu against powershell. Chocolatey serves the purpose of homebrew very, very well. The Metro/Modern UI / Desktop schism for multi-tasking needs a expectations check... basically you are in one or the other experience, and AFAIK you cannot split-screen a Metro App and Desktop App.<p>Oh, and calibration of pen in the corners still feel off even after the 130/272 pt calibration task which gets ultimately ignored by wacom feel drivers.<p>Edit: Tomb Raider & Saints Row 3 run at playable framerates in low settings when in battery mode (as opposed to charging mode); this is important if gaming is an important data point to you. When people have been discussing gaming performance, I think reviewers have been tethered to an outlet, which probably is more generous with allocating hardware to games. The one USB slot and Windows 8 were fine w/ third party xbox 360 controller bluetooth dongles after installing official drivers. snes8x (the metro app version of snes9x) makes for a fun plane ride. :) OH, and audio coming out of the surface pro is surprisingly good for an ultraportable. As a tablet, the weight balance in portrait mode feels off but web browsing is pretty fantastic in portrait.

Kindle books (mobi) not purchased from amazon (e.g. O&#x27;Reilly, PragProg, etc) aren&#x27;t supported in the app. But if you buy ebooks from a great publisher like PragProg you have them in epub and PDF format. For programming books, epub doesn&#x27;t seem to work out well, even in the popular Freda app. Then again, without the bells/whistles, I&#x27;ve enjoyed the code formatting advantages of reading PDF files.

When that first occurred, I was somewhat annoyed.  However, I fairly quickly found that full installer downloads were provided under the... &quot;other languages and systems&quot; link/page, or whatever it is specifically labelled.<p>I did also, over time, observed that the new pattern, including automatic downloads and updates -- or prompts to update -- probably would help significantly in keeping the majority &quot;non-technical&quot; user population up to date, particularly on Windows, that I was using more at that time.<p>More recently, I&#x27;ve been using Ubuntu primarily, and I&#x27;ve gotten used to the release hitting package management within a couple of hours.  I reboot daily, and usually check for and install updates when I do, so Firefox updating has just become part of the daily routine.<p>I do, nonetheless, think there is something of a &quot;dark pattern&quot; going around, in general, of making erstwhile stand-alone processes more dependent upon network-connected and dependent back-end services.<p>When I occasionally help family and friends out with a new computer, no longer can I download their ISP-provided security software and get it up and running before plugging into the network.

Doctors perform for-profit (as opposed to for-patient) procedures that guarantee more explanations and more paperwork.<p>3) Doctors and hospitals have direct personal contact with patients, but insurance companies don&#x27;t. In cases where doctors put patients at huge risk with needless procedures and surgeries, it&#x27;s easy for hospitals and doctors to point their finger at insurance companies. On the other hand, many sincere, honest doctors have difficulty getting patients the care they should have because insurers believe they are getting ripped off by unnecessary procedures, even when they aren&#x27;t.<p>4) Doctors make needless tests out of fear of being sued for not doing them.<p>5) The vast majority of healthcare costs occur in final last year or so of someone&#x27;s life.

6636042,comment,6625473,6632035,1,0,nhaehnle,,,"Perhaps. There are two problems that significantly weaken that kind of transmission mechanism:<p>1. It is not clear how sensitive to interest rates business are anyway. If you have an X increase of savings, which reduces business revenue by X but also decreases the interest rate by Y, which of those effects is stronger? It seems to depend a lot on circumstances.<p>2. To a first approximation, there is no incentive for banks to decrease their interest rates in the first place, because they won&#x27;t have extra money in the vault!<p>This may seem counter-intuitive, but it follows from how the banking system works: If you transfer money to bank A and leave it there, the bank is initially going to have more money in its account at the central bank (aka &quot;reserves&quot; aka high-powered money). This earns zero or negligible interest, and so the bank does have an incentive to get rid of it.<p>However, when you did your transfer, that central bank money (aka &quot;reserves&quot;) arriving at bank A did not come out of nowhere. It came from the bank you made the transfer <i>from</i>, say bank B. B now likely has a short-fall of reserves (because while bank B has &quot;lost&quot; X amount of reserves, and the sum of customer accounts has been reduced by X, its reserve requirements have only decreased by rX, where r is the reserve ratio).<p>So, bank B will be happy to borrow (X - rX) reserves back from bank A, probably at current market rates, while bank A <i>must</i> hold on to the remaining rX due to its own increased reserve requirements. Everything is back in balance without any change of interest rates.<p>Things are slightly different if you put your money into a different type of account or bank bond in such a way that the sum of all reserve requirements in the banking system decreases. In that case, banks have surplus reserve requirements and will therefore bid down interest rates in the interbank market.<p>Under normal circumstances, the central bank - which has a fixed interest rate target - will step up and sell assets in exchange for reserves so that the surplus reserves disappear. Hence, banks <i>still</i> do not have any incentive to reduce the interest rate that they offer to the public!<p>This really only changes when the central bank decides to change its interest rate target.<p>What about interest rates offered to customers? It seems that those really tend to be calculated as cost-plus based on the central bank&#x27;s rate target (with some long-term expectation thrown in). Plus, they probably move with some delay because that market isn&#x27;t so fast. Since the target rate has been at zero for a very long time now, savings behavior really shouldn&#x27;t make a difference.<p>Mostly though, I think it&#x27;s the first point that matters: Business decisions aren&#x27;t that interest rate-sensitive in the first place, at least compared to other considerations.",1383068568

Medicare (which EVERY Australian gets) sets reasonable rates for almost any procedure. They also give Doctors incentive&#x27;s to charge these set rates. A doctor can charge what they want, but if they do their patients have to pay out of pocket and go to medicare to get compensated. That means less patients choose those doctors. A doctor that charges the scheduled fees is able to &quot;Bulk Bill&quot; that means that the government will transfer payment directly to the doctor (I am not sure how regularly), which means they are likely to have far more patients and really it keeps everything more convenient (No cash on premises, etc.)<p>On another point, I think that a serious problem is Tort Law. Unfortunately it&#x27;s such a complicated debate I don&#x27;t think it could ever be resolved in the US. I personally believe the New Zealand government has this perfect with the ACA (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accident_Compensation_Corporation"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accident_Compensation_Corporati...</a>). While it is still possible to pursue a civil suit against someone, in the case of a car accident for example. No lawyer is going to do this pro-bono. You have the right to claim medical and loss of work directly from the ACA, therefore the likelihood of a New Zealand judge awarding a large claim would require some serious negligence by the other driver and even then the cost of pursuing that would not be worth the risk. After all, a &quot;normal&quot; person would be satisfied with being medically taken care of and having any loss of income recovered.

He lists 6 reasons why healthcare is expensive, then claims that Obamacare doesn&#x27;t fix any of them, but he&#x27;s entirely wrong on at least 5 of the 6.<p>1. Medicare / insurance fraud  ---  The author obviously hasn&#x27;t heard of the Health Care Fraud Prevention and Enforcement Action Team (HEAT). HEAT led to the record number of fraud charges in 2012. In addition to that, ACA standardized fraud convictions, so any provider convicted of fraud can no longer claim any federal money (Previously, a provider convicted of medicare fraud could still collect payments from medicaid et al).[2] These are only 2 provisions of the roughly 50 that directly address fraud. [2a]<p>2. Massive amounts of Paperwork --- This paperwork is moving to EHR / EMR systems that will file it automatically for the vast majority of patients. ACA mandates that the systems must use a standard format, so that any system built can communicate with all federal / private insurance carriers. [2]<p>3. Since doctors have direct contact with patients, and insurance companies don&#x27;t it&#x27;s easy for docs to blame insurance companies for unnecessary procedures --- I&#x27;m confused by this point, it seems a bit confused and contradictory toward his other points.<p>4. Doctors perform needless tests for fear of being sued --- The author has clearly never heard of ACOs. One of their primary goals is to limit the number of tests and procedures done.  Insurance companies and the government will provide fairly significant bonuses when the cost of provided care comes in below average. [4a]  In addition, the ACA provides research grants to study best practices and patient outcomes, having published, peer-reviewed research for common diagnoses will greatly limit the ability to sue for stuff considered CYA. [4b]<p>5. End of life care is insanely expensive --- This would&#x27;ve been addressed in the ACA, but Sarah Palin, Newt Gingrich and their dimwit followers torpedoed the &#x27;death panels&#x27; to score some cheap political points.<p>6. Life is prolonged without living will --- Again, thank Sarah Palin, Newt Gingrich, and the Fox News brigade for their insane rants against &#x27;death panels&#x27; which would have directly addressed this.<p>[1] - <a href=""http://www.npr.org/2011/12/30/144491419/doj-posts-record-for-health-care-fraud-cases"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.npr.org/2011/12/30/144491419/doj-posts-record-for...</a>\n[2] - <a href=""http://www.healthit.gov/policy-researchers-implementers/standards-certification-rules"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.healthit.gov/policy-researchers-implementers/stan...</a>\n[2a] - <a href=""http://www.btlaw.com/files/ALERT%20-%20Healthcare_Health%20Care%20Reform%20Fraud%20Abuse.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.btlaw.com/files/ALERT%20-%20Healthcare_Health%20C...</a>\n[4a] - <a href=""http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/wp/2013/08/29/obamacares-cost-control-programs-may-be-contagious/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/wp/2013/08/29/o...</a>\n[4b] - <a href=""http://www.nlm.nih.gov/hsrinfo/cer.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.nlm.nih.gov/hsrinfo/cer.html</a>\n[5 & 6] - <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_panel"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_panel</a>",1383067286

Worse still, the <audio> mechanism of handing the browser a list of sources (so it can try to aggressively reduce wasted bandwidth) doesn&#x27;t work because Web Audio requires you to download a full file before it can be decoded. Oops!<p>Shipped demos out there rely on Chrome-only Web Audio features that never made it into the spec, because Web Audio was written first as a non-portable implementation and then haphazardly turned into a spec while people were already building code against that implementation.<p>The spec changed after Google shipped it to the public (without putting it behind a flag or otherwise versioning it) so there are corner cases (albeit mostly small ones) where two spec-compliant implementations (Firefox and Chrome&#x27;s for example) will produce different output.

From the user side or business side?

While it&#x27;s also important to socialize kittens as soon as possible to make them comfortable around humans, I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s a good idea to haul them around town in a car. Cats don&#x27;t like to be taken outside their known environment at all, and they don&#x27;t like to be locked inside a box, or transported in a noisy car.<p>Just to give some perspective, my own cat loves people, strange or familiar, it doesn&#x27;t matter at all. Take her to the vet in a car though, and she will go mental, crap and pee in the cat carrier, meow and hiss when she gets let outside of it (never does that otherwise) and be extremely edgy for sometimes 2 days afterwards. I wouldn&#x27;t go as far as saying this is &#x27;cruel&#x27; to the kittens, and it&#x27;s great that the proceedings are donated to an animal shelter, but I&#x27;m pretty sure the kittens will not enjoy it nearly as much as the people who get to cuddle with them.",1383066114

He chose to stand by his value system and doing some other job less powerful but more lucrative in the corporate sector.<p>This is a repeating theme of officers who standby the truth not able to withstand the system.<p>Another thing I wish that can change is the &quot;jugaad&quot; attitude. This was popularized by some of the management thinkers [1]. In its most benevolent it can mean &quot;frugal innovation&quot; or &quot;make things work with the available resources&quot;. In its every day use though, it means &quot;getting things done - regardless of the means - that is through connections or influencing through money etc.,&quot;. The idea is to get things done quickly somehow.<p>Understandably, this attitude leads to lot of &quot;quality-less&quot; work being passed on for what it should not be otherwise. Things are not looked at from a permanent solution perspective.<p>I wish people learn the right attitude from childhood (not cutting into lines, managers treating employees as people and not take them for granted etc.,) and do things right and well rather than do some &quot;jugaad&quot; and quickly be done with it as a temp fix only to stare at the problem again in a shorter time than it is supposed to last.<p>Of course, there are towering well known counter examples like Gandhi and not-so-well-known to western audience like Kamaraj [2] and Kakkan[3]. These were self-less political leaders who were honest to the core and died almost penniless. Somehow slowly the quality has been diluting over 50+ years and reached a stage of stasis as it is now.<p>Edit: added qualifier on references 2 and 3.<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jugaad"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jugaad</a>\n[2] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K._Kamaraj"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K._Kamaraj</a>\n[3] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P._Kakkan"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P._Kakkan</a>",1383066098

All told I'm happy with vim's efficiency and power, but I'm mortified at how hard it is to get the kind of word wrap that even stupid HTML textareas achieve with no apparent effort.<p>Consider the text<p><pre><code>  Etiam ornare mollis tortor. Suspendisse sed neque. Nullam in elit. Cum sociis nullam.\n</code></pre>\nBy default, with an 80-character width vim displays this as<p><pre><code>  Etiam ornare mollis tortor. Suspendisse sed neque. Nullam in elit. Cum sociis nu\n  llam.\n</code></pre>\nOf course, you can turn on word wrap, and get this:<p><pre><code>  Etiam ornare mollis tortor. Suspendisse sed neque. Nullam in elit. Cum sociis\n  nullam.\n</code></pre>\nThe problem is that vim inserts a <i>newline</i> at the linebreak, which I most emphatically do <i>not</i> want. In other words, I want the text to display exactly as vim displays it with word wrap turned on, but <i>without</i> inserting a newline. (This way it can be pasted into HTML textareas and email programs, among other places.)<p>Web searches have yielded nothing of use, despite diligent effort; I hope Hacker News can succeed where my Google-fu has failed.",1232584904

110766,comment,109802,110364,0,0,ardit33,,,"nope, learning Python is much better.  It is a really good book that teaches you even what's going behind the scenes in python.  Diveintopyhon is good if you have no patience, but you probably will miss a lot things that ""learning python"" explains,  especially if you are new into scripting languages (I came from Java, and some php experience).<p>Take a week and a half of time, two hours a day, and read it.  Meanwhile make sure you practice some in your own, and then start a small real project, so you can actually start imprinting what you learnt.",1202366790

110752,comment,110541,110599,0,0,derefr,,,"When I read the ""lvalues and references"" part, I thought about functional programming and equivalence. That is, an interpreter where you can state:<p><pre><code>    f(g(h(x))) = n
</code></pre>
and any time the first was mentioned, it would be substituted with the second, and vice versa, whichever allows the evaluator to simplify to a greater extent.<p>Then, thinking further, are there any programming languages that rely on the sorts of math where f(f^-1(x)) is simplified to x without being evaluated?",1202365748

You view the screen by looking into a binocular scope.  On each side of scope is a row of four buttons where you can place your fingers.  The screen displays random permutations of the numbers 1-8, and you select one digit of your PIN from each permutation.",1202364070

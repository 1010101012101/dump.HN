Google hasn't recrawled the site yet so all links from Google are broken. I just found this out because I'm looking for ""media mail"" shipping prices, and the first 3 USPS results in Google are all broken. Google will eventually recrawl them, but I'm sure there are many sites all over the web that link to their old pages, which is gonna hurt them bigtime, SEO-wise.<p>To anyone working on a site redesign: redirecting old URLs is one of those things that is easy to overlook, but it can make a huge difference in the way prospective visitors see your site. Do not neglect this important step.<p>Edit: also, their new search sucks, which makes the site nearly unusable. Again, I'm trying to find prices for Media Mail, and I know they have an entire page dedicated to it. But if I search media mail, look at these results:<p><a href=""https://www.usps.com/search.htm?q=media%20mail"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.usps.com/search.htm?q=media%20mail</a><p>The first two links aren't even on usps, they're on eBay!

It's a philosophical difference as to which looks better.<p>BUT, the recent trend is in starting to use non-system fonts in web design, now that the Google Fonts project has taken off (together with widespread browser support for custom fonts).<p>The problem is that freely available fonts generally either have no hinting, or ""automated"" hinting -- because well-done hinting is incredibly time-consuming and, in the age of ""retina displays"", slowly losing its usefulness.<p>So, all these web fonts that render beautifully on OSX look like crap in Internet Explorer, since they have no hinting.

Besides noting that you have very little knowledge in PL research at the end, I made no comments about you personally.<p><i>Second you are pursuing religious arguments about programming languages.</i><p>Nope, I specifically mentioned practical things that matter.<p><i>Third you are arguing things about PL/I that are really not part of the language.</i><p>If you're talking about things like, ""no one knows PL/I,"" so what? This is entirely relevant from an engineering standpoint. Just because it's not ""really part of the language"" is irrelevant because we're not debating whether or not PL/I is better than C/C++ in the 1950s in a perfect world, we're talking about practical engineering <i>right now</i> on <i>real systems.</i><p><i>Fourth much of what you say about PL/I is technically wrong.</i><p>Not a one.<p><i>What PL/I compilers are awful? As far as I know, there aren't very many and the more common ones there are, essentially all from IBM, are highly polished.</i><p>Only if you're using compiler benchmarks from the 90's. I'm looking for things like packrat parsing and partial and incremental linking. Auto SSE/SIMD would be nice. If you're so convinced that IBM PL/I is good enough, why don't you benchmark it against GCC (on Intel ICC often outperforms GCC but I'm confident even GCC will far outperform PL/I).<p><i>That it's my 'favorite' doesn't mean that I suggest that others use it. I used the IBM PL/I on OS/2 a few times; I have the IBM PL/I for Windows but don't even have it installed. On Windows I use Visual Basic .NET, if only because it has such good access to .NET, ADO.NET, and ASP.NET. In many ways, I would prefer PL/I, but it is not a practical option.</i><p>My entire post was about how it's not a practical option and how you shouldn't be surprised when no one wants to use PL/I in production...<p><i>PL/I has some features that were deliberately included to make learning it relatively easy. E.g., PL/I has no reserved words! That is, all the 'key' words in the language can be used by programmers for their own identifier names. So, a beginner doesn't have to worry about using a reserved word. I taught some elementary parts of PL/I to some not very good students in the business school at Georgetown University, and they learned fine.</i><p>This is unimportant. Arguably it's worse than having reserved words because it allows for inadvertent shadowing, but really it's just a back-and-forth thing that no one cares about.<p><i>For 3, the only serious problem with 'type safety' is for pointers. True, in PL/I, pointers do not have 'types' based on what they point to. That is, any pointer can point to anything. But, then, using pointers in PL/I is not nearly as necessary or common as in C/C++, is quite advanced, and is not common. I liked using pointers because can really work with the memory and, at times, write some 'polymorphic' functions. Tricky work with pointers is always tricky, and that the pointers in PL/I are not 'strongly typed' didn't make the work harder. Again, PL/I is not nearly as dependent on pointers as C; a C programmer is forced to used pointers frequently, and PL/I programmer can do fine using pointers only rarely.</i><p>You completely misunderstood -- C and C++ are the standards. If you want people to use something not-standard you need to provide something which is <i>far better</i> in your own language than in the standards in order to compel people to switch. Being a little bit better isn't good enough, you need to be a <i>lot</i> better. Strong typing, garbage collection, and higher-order functions are all things which <i>suck</i> in C/C++. If you want people to adopt your language you should offer full support for these things because that gives you a compelling reason to switch.<p><i>Otherwise on types, PL/I took the attitude...</i><p>Read more about strong typing and read about type or category theory (preferably both). C and Java types are not strong typing, they're typing done in probably the worst possible way. Learn ML.<p><i>Or can do a calculation, enter a Begin-End block and do the automatic allocation inside that block.</i><p>Welcome to RAII, circa 2000.<p><i>To get around the problem, end up using C structures or C++ classes, both of which are much less efficient.</i><p>Only in C or C++ compilers from 1995...<p><i>Actually, can claim that for some years Rexx, with a few extensions for some lower level OS access, basically 'ran' all of IBM: There were about 4000 mainframes around the world connected with simple bisync lines. In the end, it all looked much like the Internet today. So, the mainframes were acting as both the servers and the routers. The hard work of the routing, security, etc. was done with 'server virtual machines' programmed mostly in Rexx with a few routines for some lower level access. It worked surprisingly well. Rexx was no toy.</i><p>It really is. IBM hasn't even come close to building what would be termed a modern distributed system infrastructure. There's no PL/I equivalent for MapReduce, BigTable, GFS, etc.<p><i>A lot of nonsense. On IBM, PL/I used standard OS calling sequences. Calling Fortran, Cobol, assembler, and C was routine. I wrote a collection of routines in PL/I to call C to call the TCP/IP routines. Occasionally I called assembler from PL/I.</i><p>OS calling sequences are the bare-minimum. If I wanted to optimize my Python code by dropping down and rewriting the code in a systems language, C has my back. Good luck with PL/I.<p>You seem to be using a lot of examples from HPC but they're not really relevant. HPC is a pretty easy target because you get to make a lot of assumptions about the DS you're architecting and the software that will be run on it. PL/I is just a dead language -- there's no reason to ever switch to it and while it may have been slightly better than C++ during IBM's heyday, the world has moved on. Even scientific computing prefers parallel Fortran, which ever since the latest version is incredibly fast.",1311630490

I don't feel that it can harm me here - if you judge me by this I couldn't care less and everyone close to me knows about it. I'm not afraid of sharing it.<p>I'm in my early thirties but a couple (6? 8? I'd need to look it up) years ago I did what no one wants to confess doing: I was at a student party, roughly 20km away from home. I had a lot of beer (too much) and, after a (subjective) long chill-out time with a friend (no alcohol, just watching series, talking, etc.) I convinced myself that I was able to drive home.\nTo this date I claim that the intentions were good: The following morning a renowned speaker was talking at the place where I studied and I wanted to be there. But - first of all intentions don't matter in this case and then I don't trust myself with this reasoning. At that time I might've been convinced of this 'need' and probably I repeated it after that night so often that it just seems to be true. Is it? I cannot tell.<p>I drove home, in a car that I bought a month ago (used, but on a lease). Mind you, this is the German Autobahn, but I wasn't speeding. Probably in the range of 120-140 km/h. I crashed my car. To this day no one knows (and the only person that _could_ explain it is writing these lines) what happened, the best explanation after some serious steps back, mentally, is that I just fell asleep for a second. I touched the middle guard railing (if the dictionary provides me with the right word), reacted poorly (..) and crashed into the right one, two times. Came to a standstill. I was alone in the car, the (2-lane) road was empty at that hour (4am? 5am?). I was fine - and incredibly lucky.<p>A truck driver stopped and asked me if I was okay and repeatedly, to make sure that I actually make sense, if someone is still in the car. Then he called the police, as it is the law. They took the wrecked car, brought me into a police station, did a multitude of tests (reaction, pupils etc. pp) and took blood. I'm not sure if they took my driving license at that point already, but I think they did. Afterwards they sent me home (I took a bus with my last money).<p>I got a trial for this incident with the result that the judge said I did a mightily bad mistake but he saw now reason to claim that I did this intentional (it's a huge difference if you are (grossly) negligent or found to do something intentional/on purpose).<p>Result:<p>- I was alive, well, no one was harmed. Luck!<p>- I lost my driving license for 10 month. I needed to do prove my physical ability again to regain it afterwards. I didn't need to do (something that you get if you are a not a first time offender, have a bad record or cross over a line of blood alcohol) a psychological test to check if I'd ever be allowed to drive again. Do you have something similar over there?<p>- I lost my 'new' used car, so I had debts worth a couple thousand EUR for a car that was gone<p>- I was sentenced to a fine of 30 days, my income was set to be 50 EUR -> 1500 EUR (my real income at that time was 500 EUR/month, I don't get the numbers)<p>- My insurance refused to pay the (still not sure about the word) guarding rails. These innocent looking metal things are awfully expensive and added another couple of thousand EUR to my debt.<p>- I got some (4? 5?) points in our central register in Germany. You're allowed to have at max 18 points, but you get issues before (a forced 'reeducation'/driving course at 14 for example) before you lose your license. Points 'awarded' for stuff like this have a prolonged lifetime. Usually points are 'gone' after two years, unless you get new ones. These were set for 5 years, because of alcohol.<p>Needless to say, this was a hard (but maybe cheap - I just had to pay some money and no one was hurt) lesson. For the crappy idea of going home at night, drunk, after a party, I payed probably a sum that surpassed 5 digits, and I wasn't a victim. I _knew_ my mistake - and everyone around me as well. So - you're the idiot that realized it far too late..<p>Suffice to say: I won't repeat that. Funny enough I'm now in a country where this again seems to be more ~lenient~ or at least very common. I know, I'll never try it again.<p>The reason for this lengthy post: As you can certainly guess I have a strong feeling about this topic. Whatever you _think_ you can do after a couple of drinks doesn't matter. IF you crash (and the risk is higher than you think) you pay so much more. Even if you are drunk _and_ innocent, you lose. Don't do it! It's not worth the risk.<p>If you still think 'Hey, but I'm fine. I know how my body reacts.': The doctor that the police waked up to check me (just a minor embarrassment during the night, I'm still sorry for her as well though) wrote in her report that I showed no typical signs of alcohol abuse: Reaction time was okay, pupils reacted ok, I was calm (albeit shocked) and reasonable. If you think this is makes you able to drive, think again.<p>And - I love to drive. Still. And before I left Germany I used to drive fast, the last couple of years. I'd say I'm an experienced driver on our streets without speed limit. That doesn't help though.<p>Amen. And sorry for the long post..<p>(A disclaimer that I should've put into the post from the start: I downvoted the 'automatic cars' claim and upvoted the veto. Even with this experience I don't think that this is a solution. We could find a multitude of different things that you shouldn't handle carelessly, drunk or without care (and, you know, I could bring up an Amendment here, for one), but 'It can be used to cause harm, don't use it' is usually not a solution. Probably never is.)",1311630127

2804768,comment,2803970,2803970,3,0,timmaxw,,,"The problem is with the US patent system, not with the patent trolls.<p>The benefit to society of granting a patent is that it gives companies an incentive to do R&D. The cost to society of granting a patent is that other companies have to pay money to use the same idea. In a healthy patent system, the average benefit of a patent is equal to the average cost of a patent.<p>If the average benefit is higher than the average cost, the Patent Office should be more lenient in granting patents, or should lengthen the term of the patent. The former solution would increase the number of patents, but the new ones would have lower average benefit. The latter solution would reduce the average cost of a patent. Likewise, if the average benefit is lower than the average cost, the Patent Office should be stricter in granting patents or should shorten the term of the patent.<p>The average benefit from a software patent is quite low; most software patents are for an obvious solution to an uncommon problem, not for a clever solution to a common problem. The average cost for a software patent is (currently) pretty low too, because patent holders usually don't assert their rights; but if patent holders asserted their rights whenever they could, the average cost would be very high. The solution is for the US Patent Office to be much stricter about assigning software patents.<p>In a healthy patent system, patent trolls aren't a bad thing. Patent trolls raise the price of patents by buying and using them; that increases the incentives to do R&D. Since in a healthy patent system, the cost to society of the patent troll asserting its patent rights is equal to the benefits from the R&D that gets done, that isn't a problem.",1311629714

These steps would ensure the company whose app we use only knows that we are using the app, and not what our data is or who else we are interacting with.

After an hour, I realized I could use the .mobileconfig file for the iPad/iPhone (on our network) to set up a profile for my Mac and then things went smoothly.

2804674,comment,2804575,2804575,2,0,bartonfink,,,"There's a concept in psychology called Maslow's hierarchy of needs, which tries to answer the ? of what actually motivates people. Essentially, some motivations are more foundational than others, and you can't work on ""higher"" needs successfully while your mind is distracted by other problems. For instance, someone who is drowning is motivated by getting more air and will completely ignore hunger because it's a less immediate motivator than lack of oxygen. Ultimately, Maslow believes we're motivated by a need to maximize our potential, which he calls ""self actualization"", but it's very easy to get tripped up by motivations below that in the hierarchy.<p>You're asking us to help you prioritize between two opportunities. The FilmBet project sounds like something you really get a lot out of, which is pretty close to the ""self actualization"" need Maslow described. The vacation app will bring in lots more money which will help put you in a better place to self actualize later, but it sounds very much like a means instead of an end.<p>Trying to define the point when a need is met is somewhat subjective. For instance, some people are big eaters, whereas some aren't. Some folks are perfectly comfortable living paycheck to paycheck, whereas some folks want to have 2 years salary saved up for a rainy day. If you feel that you are secure enough financially, physically and emotionally, then I'd go ahead and do the FilmBet work because it sounds like you enjoy it. Otherwise, I'd keep plugging away on the vacation app because the money from that is going to help put you in a better position down the road to work on something you actually enjoy.",1311628537

In that situation you do not see individual gravitons but only the aggregate effect of the sea of gravitons you are in.<p>This is similar to e.g. fluid dynamics, which is only valid at scales much larger than the atomic scale. But if you look close enough, you will see effects that are not consistent with viewing a fluid as a continuum of matter (e.g. minute specks of dust moving randomly because they are hit by individual atoms).",1311627958

They don't need to know how to quit an app anymore. Why would you ever care to quit an app? That's a legacy concept that's so ingrained in the author's memory that he can't comprehend not knowing it. Think, instead, of all the time his parents wasted trying to understand this quitting apps thing.<p>My girlfriend was using my iPhone and kept asking me ""how do I quit the browser now."" She was used to a PocketPC/WM phone, where if you don't manage your open apps, your phone crawls. I had to keep saying: ""don't worry about it, just lock the phone. There is no closing.""<p>10 years from now we will look back on quitting apps and saving files as relics of the ancient times, like floppy disks and parallel ports.",1311627930

If for whatever reason you cannot get use to it, you can always change your settings to the 'old' scrolling style.<p>If anything, I'm disappointed that Lion wasn't even more of a change, but I guess for me it would have been change for the sake of change, as Lion, just like Snow Leopard works great for me.<p>Additionally, others I personal know that have switched to Lion, no one has any problems with it and everyone likes it.

One is preventing non-person entities from using the service.  Nobody wants a ""friend"" that's ""Mashable News"" or ""Coca Cola"".  When these accounts start following you, it's worse than spam.  If you want to advertise, buy an ad so I can block it.<p>Secondly is the ""anonymous people are jackasses"" problem that's pervasive everywhere on the Internet.  If people have to use their real names, they will behave on G+ as they would in person, which makes for a nicer experience.<p>Anyway, you can legally change your name to whatever you want (I have a friend whose US passport says ""Ingy dt Net""), so if you really consider yourself to be your nickname, get a government ID with that nickname on it.  Problem solved.  (This problem is also solved with Photoshop, FWIW.)",1311627911

I'm finding it makes me even more effective - I fly round my Air like I can fly round my source code with Vim. I find the gestures and the trackpad make a mouse feel like a clumsy ancient thing, Launchpad is acutally not too bad sometimes - gesture tap is quicker than ctrl-space typing enter (I use launchbar now - switched from quicksilver when it was going through rough times). Mission control, or whatever it's called, is much better than spaces and expose - I love the re-arrange spaces so apps I alt-tab between are close to each other.

250944,story,,,10,16,anotherguy,"Ask HN: Fair share deal between me and my cofounder",,"Hi,<p>let me quickly explain my situation. I quit my job in March this year and started working on creating a prototype which \nis nearly ready to launch now (we just need a few more servers). During that time I exchanged the ideas I had with a\nfriend of mine. He quit his job 3 months afer I do and after I finished the prototype (he probably wouldn't have quit\nhis job if he hadn't seen the prototype working).<p>The inital impuls, ideas and also the ideas we are now following all come from me. I also relocated back to my hometown. We also got accepted\nin an incubator and got free offices and coaching for at least 4 months, which I would say, is mainly because of the working prototype I \ncreated.<p>We are probably exploring two different business ideas at the same time. One idea is a pure search related web startup. For that case I definitely don't\nneed my cofounder (as he is more the business guy), and if I would like to have a cofounder for that part, I would definitely like a technical person. \nIn addition to that we are exploring a more tradional business (we are resuing the software I created to sell a service to local companies). This one requires \nselling stuff to people and this is where my cofounder comes in. I'm pretty sure I can't do both things alone.<p>Anyway, for the second type of business there are two parts. The technial one (I nearly completed) and the selling part, which then has to be completed. Now, \nI don't know if my cofounder is even good at doing this (as he doesn't have any experience doing this (worked in consulting business), is still relatively youg\nas I am, and probably doesn't ahve many connections, and I also don't know him very well).<p>If he would fail, I would end up not only losing money, but also time (which is the most precious), even though I probably would have fullfilled my part.\nMy idea was to let us both invest an initial sum of x into our company and we both wouldn't take out any salary out of it in the first months. In addition, the 3 months\nrevenues (let's say y, a little bigger than x) I lost from quitting my job earlier than he did (as he was still earning money at that time) are virtually added\nto the sum I'm investing. In addition there is also risk of quitting the job first and creating the prototype, idea, relocating and the incubator which I would\nlike to weight somehow as well. But I'm not yet sure on how much this is worth. Also there is the risk that he doesn't sell anything at all. In that case I would\nlike to get rid of him, as he is simply wasting my time. So my idea on this part is to make a deal that if he doesn't manage to get that many customers and doesn't\ngenerate that much revenue in a given time frame, he simply has to hand over his shares to me. In that case I could still contine business idea 1 or even consider\ngoing further with business idea 2, depeding if there is still a chance. I would however have lost a lot of time (also explaining things to him and discussing things...).\nThe easiest possibility would be to only overwrite him his shares if he reaches his goal, instead of taking them from him away (from a legal view). But I don't think he\nwill agree with that one.<p>I was thinking of a 65:35 deal (alone moneywise it would be more like 2.2:1, let alone the imaterial things I didn't add, like the idea, risk, etc...), \nbut I think it is too high. But if he manages to get us profitable by the end of year, I find it is ok as I also benefit from it, allthough I took a much higher risk than he did (also timewise).<p>Another related question. Is it common that all shareholders have to agree to sell a company or is this more uncommon?<p>What are your thoughts on this? Is there something I forgot and I should pay attention to?",1216507338

250929,story,,,1,3,jalammar,"Ask YC: Anyone using Google Site Search?",,"I'm researching different alternatives for implementing search in my site. For a while I have been thinking of implementing it using Zend_Search_Lucene. But one interesting alternative seems to be Google Site Search ( http://www.google.com/sitesearch ). It would cost $100 annually (for < 5k pages) and is a bit customizable. Time is a bit of an issue for me, so $100 is preferable to implementing search at this point, I would definitely spend more time on it at some point in the future though.<p>Has anyone tried it out or has anything to say about it? What do you use for search on your site?",1216505529

You can add new properties on-the-fly, so the schemas are extremely flexible in that regard.  Just throw data at your datastore.",1216505413

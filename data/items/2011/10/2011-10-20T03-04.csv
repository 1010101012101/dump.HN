Not sure what you are trying to accomplish by a lawsuit, but your business is over, and here is why: Option A) You give up on the lawsuit and get bullied out of the market by the sole provider. Option B) You win the lawsuit, but piss off the sole provider in the process. It's not going to be long before they make things tough on you in other ways.<p>Bottom line is, you put all your eggs in one basket, and someone took your basket.

It decreases one's intelligence to use it in an assertion. In war and throughout history, party A asserts party B is evil, and party B asserts party A is evil. If party A is truly evil, then they would have no scruples over claiming party B is truly evil, and vice versa, analagous to the Liar's Paradox. Entering this frame, and debating who is ""truly"" the evil one, is a lens more likely to obscure than clarify.<p>An alternative heuristic for assessing the merits of actions: Coercion is considered polar to freedom by many social philosophers. Does party A use coercion to force party B into making a decision that leaves party B worse off?<p>Does google use coercion to drive user registration?<p>Does google use coercion to prevent deregistration?<p>Does google use coercion to damage competitors?<p>Does google use coercion to forcefully identify the anonymous?<p>No. No they don't.",1319083050

In fact, they are probably worse at that than at other tasks because name pronunciation is difficult. I'd suggest looking at some demos.<p>As for your latter two points, yes, people may think you are silly if you speak to your phone in company. Also, background noise such as people next to you speaking can really confuse these systems. However, I've used it many times (the google version) to write short text messages and most of all to ask for directions. Why? Because it's <i>much</i> faster thank keying in all that information, especially for directions to intersections or restaurants. For the latter, the system gives a huge added bonus in that it will actually look up addresses for you just based on a store name.<p>Siri gives one extra feature over google voice actions as well: speaking back and context. While speaking back may be somewhat of a gimmick, there are lots of ways to report information, using the previous action to fill in contextual information in the current action looks to be quite useful.",1319082972

It's either robotic and boring, or it does something else.  The second, and more important reason, is that people don't take many screencaps of when Siri provides them relevant information for their particular situation.  It's not easily captures, you miss context.  With a silly thing like asking it the meaning of life, all the context is there, you can quickly see that it understood and responded accordingly.<p>I guess I just don't see the outrage over how people are using Siri.

Sure it is fun to be able to not have to deal with focusing until you are back home ""developing"" the images, but if the final output is 3mp, after you develop you are still left with an image too low-resolution for anything but screen display.  In the words of Brian Peterson (Understanding Exposure) for any particular scene there may be many ""correct"" exposures, but only one creatively interesting exposure.  Likewise, in their image gallery there is generally a single focus point that makes the most creatively interesting image, so after you've chosen that point at home, you are still looking at a very low-res image.<p>Of course, for shooting in the wild, some of their shots would just never ever get taken correctly by an autofocus system and would disappear before even a pro managed to manually focus.  And many of us never print a single photo today, so being stuck with a beautiful 3mp image may be enough.

To explain why I think so, allow me to quote the FAQ I prepare about the distinction between ""problems"" and ""exercises"" in mathematics instruction for families of students in the math classes I teach:<p>PROBLEMS VERSUS EXERCISES<p>I frequently encounter discussions among parents about repetitive school math lessons, so a few years ago I prepared this Frequently Asked Question (FAQ) document about the distinction between math exercises (good in sufficient but not excessive amount) and math problems (always good in any amount).<p>Most books about mathematics have what are called ""exercises"" in them, questions that prompt a learner to practice the concepts discussed in the mathematics book. By reading one mathematics book, and then several more, I learned that some mathematicians draw a distinction between ""exercises"" and ""problems"" (which is the terminology generally used by the mathematicians who draw this distinction). I think this distinction is useful for teachers and learners to consider while selecting materials for studying mathematics, so I'll share the quotations from which I learned this distinction here. I first read about the distinction between exercises and problems in a Taiwan reprint of a book by Howard Eves.<p>""It is perhaps pertinent to make a comment or two here about the problems of the text. There is a distinction between what may be called a PROBLEM and what may be considered an EXERCISE. The latter serves to drill a student in some technique or procedure, and requires little, if any, original thought. Thus, after a student beginning algebra has encountered the quadratic formula, he should undoubtedly be given a set of exercises in the form of specific quadratic equations to be solved by the newly acquired tool. The working of these exercises will help clinch his grasp of the formula and will assure his ability to use the formula. An exercise, then, can always be done with reasonable dispatch and with a minimum of creative thinking. In contrast to an exercise, a problem, if it is a good one for its level, should require thought on the part of the student. The student must devise strategic attacks, some of which may fail, others of which may partially or completely carry him through. He may need to look up some procedure or some associated material in texts, so that he can push his plan through. Having successfully solved a problem, the student should consider it to see if he can devise a different and perhaps better solution. He should look for further deductions, generalizations, applications, and allied results. In short, he should live with the thing for a time, and examine it carefully in all lights. To be suitable, a problem must be such that the student cannot solve it immediately. One does not complain about a problem being too difficult, but rather too easy.<p>""It is impossible to overstate the importance of problems in mathematics. It is by means of problems that mathematics develops and actually lifts itself by its own bootstraps. Every research article, every doctoral thesis, every new discovery in mathematics, results from an attempt to solve some problem. The posing of appropriate problems, then, appears to be a very suitable way to introduce the student to mathematical research. And it is worth noting, the more problems one plays with, the more problems one may be able to pose on one's own. The ability to propose significant problems is one requirement to be a creative mathematician.""<p>Eves, Howard (1963). A Survey of Geometry volume 1. Boston: Allyn and Bacon, page ix.<p>I have since read about this distinction in several other books.<p>""Before going any further, let's digress a minute to discuss different levels of problems that might appear in a book about mathematics:<p>Level 1. Given an explicit object x and an explicit property P(x), prove that P(x) is true. . . .<p>Level 2. Given an explicit set X and an explicit property P(x), prove that P(x) is true for FOR ALL x [existing in] X. . . .<p>Level 3. Given an explicit set X and an explicit property P(x), prove OR DISPROVE that P(x) is true for for all x [existing in] X. . . .<p>Level 4. Given an explicit set X and an explicit property P(x), find a NECESSARY AND SUFFICIENT CONDITION Q(x) that P(x) is true. . . .<p>Level 5. Given an explicit set X, find an INTERESTING PROPERTY P(x) of its elements. Now we're in the scary domain of pure research, where students might think that total chaos reigns. This is real mathematics. Authors of textbooks rarely dare to pose level 5 problems.""<p>Graham, Ronald, Knuth, Donald, and Patashnik, Oren (1994). Concrete Mathematics Second Edition. Boston: Addison-Wesley, pages 72-73.<p>This digression becomes the subject of a, um, problem in Exercise 4 of Chapter 3: ""The text describes problems at levels 1 through 5. What is a level 0 problem? (This, by the way, is NOT a level 0 problem.)""<p>""First, what is a PROBLEM? We distinguish between PROBLEMS and EXERCISES. An exercise is a question that you know how to resolve immediately. Whether you get it right or not depends on how expertly you apply specific techniques, but you don't need to puzzle out what techniques to use. In contrast, a problem demands much thought and resourcefulness before the right approach is found. . . .<p>""A good problem is mysterious and interesting. It is mysterious, because at first you don't know how to solve it. If it is not interesting, you won't think about it much. If it is interesting, though, you will want to put a lot of time and effort into understanding it.""<p>Zeitz, Paul (1999). The Art and Craft of Problem Solving. New York: Wiley, pages 3 and 4.<p>"". . . . As Paul Halmos said, 'Problems are the heart of mathematics,' so we should 'emphasize them more and more in the classroom, in seminars, and in the books and articles we write, to train our students to be better problem-posers and problem-solvers than we are.'<p>""The problems we have selected are definitely not exercises. Our definition of an exercise is that you look at it and know immediately how to complete it. It is just a question of doing the work, whereas by a problem, we mean a more intricate question for which at first one has probably no clue to how to approach it, but by perseverance and inspired effort one can transform it into a sequence of exercises.""<p>Andreescu, Titu & Gelca, Razvan (2000), Mathematical Olympiad Challenges. Boston: Birkhuser, page xiii.<p>""It is easier to advance in one topic by going ahead with the more elementary parts of another topic, where the first one is applied. The brain much prefers to work that way, rather than to concentrate on ugly technical formulas which are obviously unrelated to anything except artificial drilling. Of course, some rote drilling is necessary. The problem is how to strike a balance.""<p>Lang, Serge (1988), Basic Mathematics. New York: Springer-Verlag, p. xi.<p>""Learn by Solving Problems<p>""We believe that the best way to learn mathematics is by solving problems. Lots and lots of problems. In fact, we believe the best way to learn mathematics is to try to solve problems that you don't know how to do. When you discover something on your own, you'll understand it much better than if someone just tells it to you.<p>. . . .<p>""If you find the problems are too easy, this means you should try harder problems. Nobody learns very much by solving problems that are too easy for them.""<p>Rusczyk, Richard (2007). Introduction to Algebra. Alpine, CA: AoPS Incorporated, p. iii.",1319080498

Absolutely nothing can possibly measure or map onto intelligence because there just is no real definition of the word.<p>Saying that IQ measures intelligence is the same as saying that answering questions on a standardized test requires intelligence, which seems like a perfectly reasonable and valid definition to me.<p>Would you bring up this argument someone said ""He solved that math problem that has been open for hundreds of years, he is intelligent"". Would you jump in and say ""actually, solving math problems isn't necessarily a measure  of intelligence, which is what you are implying"".<p>All that solving famous unsolved math proofs shows is that you are better at solving math proofs that a bunch of other people who try to solve math proofs, what does that have to do with intelligence!",1319080114

ICS is <i>supposed</i> to bring to bear a large amount of hardware acceleration for the UI that will make 99% of these UI lag issues disappear entirely.<p>If it doesn't, that'd be supremely disappointing, since it's truly one of the things that has been plaguing Android since it first launched.<p>> <i>""Android supports just about all possible hardware configurations from low end to high end.""</i><p>All the more reason the UI stack needs to be optimized from end to end. Apple can pretty much just <i>assume</i> you have a 800MHz dual-core under the hood, Google cannot. It's taken some serious firepower to get Android's UI to be suitably responsive (we're talking dual-core, 1+ GHz beasts)... what hope does the developing world have trying to run that kind of software on little 400MHz ARM chips?<p>We know from the development of OSX (or iOS, depending on where you want to look) that even a minimal amount of hardware acceleration from low-end GPUs can do <i>wonders</i> for overall UI performance. A reasonably low-end GPU will lay waste to a large number of problems that even mid-high-end CPUs are poorly equipped to solve.<p>If anything, if Google wants to make a difference in the developing world this needs to be a top priority - after all, this is the market that is <i>least</i> able to brute force their way past performance problems with raw hardware.<p>> <i>""As the parent comment was pointing out, people are willing to pay for the luxury of animations, or polish. For most people just getting calls, text, email and mobile web, at affordable prices is all we really want.""</i><p>I think it's short-sighted to call responsive, rich UI a ""luxury"". Before Android phones hit the developing world, the status quo was candy bar phones. I'm sure there were enough people back then proclaiming they couldn't imagine needing anything more - it places calls and gets texts, what else could someone reasonably wish for?<p>But then Android brought smartphones to these parts of the world and the goalpost moved. Now expecting mobile web and email on your phone is entirely reasonable, thanks to what used to be the sole territory of luxury devices. Software is something that has literally <i>no</i> marginal cost - once produced, it can be shipped on ten million phones for negligible cost, and in this sense is pretty much the cheapest way you can improve your products. IMO saying that good UI is exclusively the territory of luxury devices is doing a great disservice to the developing world.<p>Google <i>ought</i> to be doing better, considering the sheer force they have thrown behind Android, and if these long-awaited hardware acceleration features fail to significantly tame the UI performance beast, it is in every way appropriate to call them to task on it.",1319079827

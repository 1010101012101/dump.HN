It was an X server that ran as a plugin in Netscape and IE, with a little bit of magic (""xrx"") to handle authentication to the web server.  So you could visit a web page and start running, say, FrameMaker in your browser.<p>There's a guide to getting it set up still alive at <a href=""http://www.csn.ul.ie/~caolan/TechTexts/Broadway.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.csn.ul.ie/~caolan/TechTexts/Broadway.html</a><p>This was in 1996, in the X11R6.3 release (""Broadway""), the same release they came out with LBX, the low-bandwidth extension to X, so that you could run your X11 apps over a modem with reasonable throughput.<p>It never got much adoption. I don't really know why. My guess, though, is that it didn't address the real reasons people were moving from X11 to browser apps: server load, security, ease of administration, latency-tolerance, and ease of development.<p>Today, server load and latency tolerance are a lot less important than they were in 1996, because computers are a hundred times faster and hundreds of millions of people have ping times under 20 milliseconds, ten times faster than you'd get on a modem.<p>But security, ease of administration, and ease of development are a lot more important now than they were in 1996.<p>So, I suspect this won't get widely adopted, but it could go either way.

These people have alot of underused coding time.<p>Is there a way to form these folks into startups/teams?<p>Almost like some sort of ""startup in a box"" in which developers can join a team, and everyone agrees to a predefined set of rules on equity.<p>The core idea being that everyone on the team is contributing their time at no charge.<p>Maybe it would at some level be a bit like online games where people come along and add themselves into a team.<p>A key part of this is that there is no employer, no recruiter, no ycombinator, no techstars making decisions about who can join a team.  It is up to the team members themselves somehow.<p>Developers would browse the teams, see who is in them, the technologies being used, and perhaps even some overview of the software idea being built out by the team.  They would choose which teams to join.<p>Maybe there could be some way that developers could perhaps do some practical coding tasks that actually contribute to the project and therefore prove to the team members that they should be a team member.<p>There's lots of open questions about this sort of thing, how it could be made to work, if at all.<p>What's in it for the programmers - that would have to be clear - maybe it's gaining commercial experience working with technologies that they are interested in - maybe it's some sort of equity after certain conditions have been met.<p>I'm wondering if anyone else thinks this (currently not fully thought out) idea has any merit?<p>Startups forming spontaneously from unemployed programmers who choose to donate their time, no permission required from anyone - could it work?<p>I don't want anything from this at all - I've just spent alot of time wondering about all those unemployed programmers and how they could be doing something with that time.<p>Can anyone else suggest any ideas on how it might be made to work?

Conversation ends up clustering around them rather than perhaps a more in-depth blog post <i>(perhaps the original source of a news story)</i> which leaves the community less informed (I think anyway) and less distinct from other sites.<p>If I want TechCrunch and Mashable stories, I'll look at TechMeme. I always aspired that HN would be a place to discover blogs and more community-orientated links <i>(individual's blog posts, startup's blog posts, etc)</i>.<p>I began to look at who was submitting TechCrunch and Mashable stories that made the front page, and it looks to me like quite often it is a collection of the same users.<p>To confirm I looked over:<p>http://searchyc.com/submissions/mashable?sort=by_date<p>http://searchyc.com/submissions/techcrunch?sort=by_date<p><i>(you need to page through the results set to get a clearer picture, obviously)</i><p>Particularly if you focus on submissions with >1 points, you can see the same names there.

Generally, I know what's fair for _my business_ and it's the responsibility of the other party to determine what's reasonable for them. Different parties will each have their own evaluation of a contract term - I may view something as a major risk and want protection, while the counterparty doesn't view it as likely and is happy to give that protection. This is why negotiating deals can be so interesting.<p>Providing a contract that is favorable to your own needs, while not deceptive, is in no way unfair or unscrupulous. The counterparty always has the right to negotiate or simply refuse to execute the contract. You can't expect to anticipate the needs of both parties and to do so would just make negotiating a deal more difficult, because you'll have less flexibility to give the other side what they need.",1315842986

2987734,comment,2986291,2987498,4,0,krig,,,"I didn't mean to dismiss your question, it's a reasonable one to ask.<p>The reason for considering this theory interesting is because it is at least nominally a scientific theory, whereas a God theory is not a scientific theory and thus not interesting to science.<p>Why is a God theory not a scientific theory? Let me attempt to explain..<p>A scientific theory starts with experimental observation (in this case, the observation that all electrons have the same mass and charge) and attempts to explain that observation. This explanation should be 1) testable, and 2) predictive. That is, it should be possible to disprove the theory through further experiments, and the theory should lead to further conclusions about how the world works that would then be provable through experimentation as well.<p>Now, it is doubtful that the one-electron theory is actually testable, which moves it from the realm of serious theories to merely interesting hypotheticals. This is similar to the idea of everything in the world being part of a computer simulation, for example.<p>Now, God theories in general have multiple issues that make them unscientific. For example, if you claim that God is an entity that is 'beyond time', you need to define in scientific terms what it means to be beyond time. Another issue is that you would need to come up with some experiment that would prove that God does not exist. Even if you were to formulate a definition of God that would satisfy these requirements, it is doubtful that many believers would agree with that definition. Thus, 'God theory' in general doesn't describe a scientific theory at all, and so it is fundamentally not related to science.<p>edit: I should also say that such a God theory is usually not interesting for another reason: Since it doesn't describe the god of any major religion, no one is really very interested in seeing it disproven. It's easy to invent a cosmic entity and come up with an experiment that proves that it doesn't exist, but what's the point?",1315842843

For any things you do consider changing, be sure you are keeping good track of the relevant statistics to help you know what is working and what isn't.<p>I don't think $1 a month is too high; I think the main difficulty will be just getting the consumer to overcome the mental friction inherit in any online purchase, especially subscription purchases.  You're going to have to convince people it's worth getting their wallet out for in the first place, and after that I would guess you could price it anywhere between $1 and $10 and it wouldn't drastically change how many people convert.  That's at least given the current state of the product - if you can demonstrate more value, then you may have an easier time convincing people to spend their money on it.<p>I still think your best bet is to offer a free plan to small userbases, and then charge them once they grow beyond a given size.  You could reassure them that they won't lose their images or have their account held hostage if they don't upgrade, it will just be frozen at the max limit of user icons.  I would also offer 2 upgrade plans: a basic plan which includes 1 or 2 styles/sizes of icon, and a premium plan with all the customization options.  The goal of this would be to make the basic plan more attractive while allowing those who need to customize to do so.  Another idea is to pin the free userbase option as a ""startup"" option, and sell it as a gesture of goodwill towards entrepreneurs vs. a free/paid plan.<p>I really don't know much about GAE, but do they have some way to sell this as a GAE-compatible plug-in to other App Engine users?

I have a lot of female friends that are secretaries, receptionists, assistants etc, which I don't think is true of most men working in IT.  And I see how much of the daily grind of what those women do could be automated, if only they knew how to put together macros, or even just how to make use of tools like Automator on the Mac.  I have tried teaching macro programming to a couple of them, but they get stuck on the simplest of programming concepts.  What's a variable?

Flow control, what's that?!?!<p>I can't help thinking that if they had learned these very simple basic concepts when they were back learning about how to set tabs in Word, that they would be many times more effective in their office jobs today.

So, the entrepreneur, in his trip in a small canoe across rough waters on the way to distant, solid land, needs to be very sure anyone else in that canoe is really good to have along and won't be a nervous Nellie who will break ranks, stand, and scream at the first big waves that rock the canoe.<p>In particular, in information technology (IT), what fraction of the VCs would an entrepreneur eagerly hire as, say, a co-founder, a CTO, CIO, lead developer, DBA, network administrator?  How about listen to in a discussion about a 'pivot'?  How about as Chief Scientist to stir up new, powerful, valuable 'secret sauce'?  Did I omit Power Point expert?  Gee, why would I omit Power Point expert?<p>Another point:  The day before taking the check, the entrepreneur may own 100% of the business.  The day after taking the check the VC owns maybe 30% of the business, an additional fraction is set aside for employees, and the rest 'belongs' to the entrepreneur except is in a four year 'vesting' schedule which means the entrepreneur now owns NONE of his business and, if fired by the Board, leaves with NOTHING, zip, zilch, zero, not even the source code he typed in to begin with.  Bummer.<p>Next, now IT VCs don't invest in pigs, chickens, dedicated, driven, devoted founders or any other barnyard or other nonsense.  Instead, VCs invest in numerical metrics that correlate well with future financial value.  Generally the VCs invest in 'traction', just traction, already significant and growing rapidly.<p>Then there's now a rub, a big issue:  If the traction is significant, say, 10 Web pages served a second with 3 ads per page and $1 CPM, then just why should the entrepreneur take the check?<p>Or, think of a US Main Street business in anything from a carry out pizza shop to a landscaping service:  They don't get venture capital.  But a PC server able to deliver 10 Web pages a second costs much less than even an oven for a pizza shop and much less than a truck for a landscaping service.  The difference for the IT entrepreneur is that if the project is at all successful, then (1) the entrepreneur can lean back and let the server PC do the work and (2) has a chance of growing rapidly into a significant business to own, sell, or do an IPO.  So, an IT entrepreneur can proceed as for a Main Street business until money is coming in and then see if a really good business can result.  Nowhere in there is much of a role for a VC Power Point expert.",1315842263

As more of a Gen X'er myself, I think I was part of an early transition that has picked up a lot of steam over the past two decades.<p>When I graduated from college (early 90s), there was still a lot of talk about how the old contract (you work for a company your whole life and they show you loyalty in return) was in decline.  Truth is, it was probably in its last gasps.  Now, I have a hard time thinking any 20 year old graduate would even think this arrangement exists in the first place.  Young people still seem to have a few expectations (""I did everything I was supposed to do..."", but I'd say the notion that going to college sets up for a good job is going extinct among recent grads).<p>This is an incredibly important distinction that is often lost between the boomers and millennials.  Sure, Millennials may not want to work from 8-5, and that may make them look lazy to the older folks - but keep in mind, the stability of an 8-5 job isn't there for them.<p>If someone wanted a career in software back when I was in college, I'd have recommended that they study computer science or a related degree, work hard, get good grades, try to get an internship, maybe go to a good grad school, and show a lot of diligence on the job.  That's still a reasonable way to go about it.<p>But now?  My advice to someone looking for a software career is: write something!  Got an idea?  Implement it, get it on the web, try to get some users for it.  If you don't have a good idea, talk with people, learn about other fields, see what people need and try to create it for them.  It's cheap to fail, so fail fast and keep at it.  I'm not saying you shouldn't major in CS or go to grad school - a lot of great hackers (by the standards I listed above) seem to take that path.  But what I'd really recommend is recognizing that the instability you have inherited can be liberating, even if it means you'll have to deal with a lot more uncertainty in your life.<p>Funny thing is, it was there for me, too.  I wrote all kinds of web apps in grad school, but I somehow couldn't wrap my head around the idea that they could be ""real"".  I think PG mentioned this in an essay - when you open the door to a cage for an animal that has lived in captivity for a long time, it often takes a while before the animal realizes that it can leave.  Maybe people are waking up to that now.  Nobody's going to be delivering carrots and filling up your water bowl every morning anyway...",1315842247

One strategy would be to domicile your business in a country that doesn't tax worldwide corporate income, only local income. Believe it or not, most countries meet this criteria.  Banking in a second country and living in a third, where the latter doesn't tax your worldwide income (like the USA does, but again, the US is the exception rather than the rule) would result in you effectively living tax free.  (A US citizen, owing for their worldwide income would have to pay taxes on the amount earned above the living-aboard exemption.)<p>Further, even if we decided that we wanted to bring our business back into the USA, the USA does not want us to be located here... because at some of our founders are not US citizens and the hassle and cost of importing a foreign entrepreneur to the USA is much higher than it is for many other competitive countries.[1]  There are first world countries that, believe it or not, are welcoming to entrepreneurs who want to relocate there.<p>So, while I'm not going to go into specifics because if I did, the possible combinations are more than could be discussed here, I can say with first hand experience that there are many, many options for doing this.<p>[1] Just coming in for a short term stay was more ordeal than I like to put up with, and more than we've experienced with any other country.",1315841675

If you have a company directory, you have the names of every user in the company in a table, and you need to display that information in a collation based on the locale of the viewing user. Having to have a new table for every language that contains the same data as the main table is just pointless overhead. Also, while you can choose the collation at query time, the point of per-column collation is to let you have an index over that collation. Can you please demonstrate how the use case of ""company directory"" would be cleanly and efficiently implemented using per-column collation?<p>EDIT: I've been looking more into this COLLATE keyword that they have added, and I'm actually somewhat curious to see if I can make this work (where the optimizer manages to choose the right index) by something like the following, in which case I'm going to be seriously happy... ;P.<p><pre><code>    CREATE TABLE my_table (a text);\n    CREATE INDEX my_index ON my_table ((a COLLATE ""en_US""));\n    CREATE INDEX my_index ON my_table ((a COLLATE ""de_DE""));\n    SELECT * FROM my_table ORDER BY a COLLATE ""de_DE"";</code></pre>",1315841647

That translates as ""has no useful skills."")<p>2. Locate companies in your area that employ for this position.<p>3. Start making phone calls and sending emails to the company owner or manager. Forget about responding to ads for jobs and sending resumes blindly. That doesn't work. (Many ads are placed for compliance purposes or fishing expeditions and thus do not correspond to an actual job on offer.)<p>4. The really important part. Every time you get a ""no"" get a referral or two. Keep expanding your call list via referrals.<p>5. Within 100 phones calls, you will have a job.

I've lost interest in participating in this thread.<p>That's unfortunate.<p>>If I'm so incapable of reproducing issues and ""demons in a machine"" is so laughable, why exactly does the ""Unhandled ExecutionEngineException"" exist and why was it more than trivial for me to reproduce?<p>Well, an ExecutionEngineException is simply the CLR encountering some unexpected problem. The CLR is a piece of software like any other, it is simply a COM component, written in C++. Like any other program it too can have bugs and situations that it fails to handle gracefully. They are not untraceable or uncatchable in any way, I have caught and debugged a number of them. Of course without the pdbs/source that is much harder for an external person to do. In my experience it is actually preceded by an SEH exception that the CLR itself will catch and translate into the rather generic ExecutionEngineException, so watching for first chance SEH exceptions is generally more fruitful.<p>>So now three MS people doubting me, mocking me, and suggesting #win32 as remotely comparable to open source style IRC rooms.<p>So when I point out that 'untraceable uncatchable exceptions' don't exist you see that as mocking you? Or was I the doubting one? I am simply a software engineer, like I assume you are. I was pointing out some things don't exist. If untraceable, uncatchable exceptions existed there would be a class of bugs that were logically impossible to find/fix.<p>As for 'the .NET runtime informing you that it was unaware of where the crash was occurring', the .NET runtime would never be aware of such a thing as a crash is a crash. It means the exception found no handler and the process was terminated. Figuring out why is what a debugger is for, not the runtime.<p>>I'd post it here, but I'd prefer it were not linked to my name as Googling the error message reveals my only post.<p>It is strange that you want to hide your identity so much.<p>>This is just sad, and ironic as all get out considering the fact that my original comment was that Microsoft and community don't play nice together. Don't you see that irony?<p>Not really, 'the community' doesn't consist of a single person. I am active on the MSDN forums in my area of expertise. I am also active on my team's blog. In the course of such activities I regularly encounter trolls, I am not saying you are one, just saying they exist. To 'play nice' with a troll is pointless. Some people have axes to grind and no matter what you say or do they will be upset, there is no point trying to help those people. Also, if people are rude from the get-go I tend to not bother helping them, since I generally am spending my own free time to try to help them out, and there are lots of other things I could be doing. Civility is kind of the minbar for what I expect of them.<p>As for 'open source' communities being more civil/friendly...well that is certainly not my experience across the board, but then again, people always have different experiences and tend to remember the worst/most frustrating of them and project that as 'the norm'.",1315840613

I remember working at WordPerfect in the late 80s and seeing some of the developers houses - one guy built a medieval castle complete with a working moat and drawbridge.<p>At the time I was hired in '89 or so they were doing away with that practice.  ""New developers don't get royalties any more.""<p>But, it was a good business to be in for a short time.  I'm not sure if Microsoft developers ever enjoyed royalties.",1315839939

We discussed some alternative options & put some timelines in place to help reduce the risks I'd face.<p>Might everything fall apart tomorrow? Sure. But my company was 100% up front with me regarding my risks -- at least if we fail, we fail together.<p>I've had friends who have joined companies as the #1 where the owner <i>completely</i> misrepresented the situation of the company throughout the whole process, were burned, and are now working stable jobs that they hate.

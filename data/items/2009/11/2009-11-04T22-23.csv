I think it is safe to assume folks here have high ethical standards, something he has repeatedly shown to lack. High ethical standards cost money, cost business and market share. It's not easy to keep them, but, I am sure most of us here do it regardless of the cost to the business, for not doing so has a much higher cost in out consciousness.<p>When you command a group, be it a company, a department or a bunch of kids, people will do what you want them to do and do whatever your behavior and apparent standards enable them to.

922779,comment,922486,922627,0,0,skmurphy,,,"Targeting a niche doesn't preclude you from later targeting another niche and ultimately ""general (and bigger) audiences."" It intensifies word of mouth effects because people in a niche are more likely to reference each other's buy decisions than in a general market (e.g. if you reach out to military families saying that other military families use it--provided, obviously that this is true--you are more likely to get signup than telling a general population that ""families use it.""). If you can't target a niche, at least initially, you may need to raise a lot of money to cover your customer acquisition costs.<p>The two press clippings you cite actually address two distinct niches: global families (families with members widely geographically separated who want to stay in touch), and scrap bookers, people who want to commemorate family events and milestones and pass them along. You don't have general press coverage, you have two distinct use cases.<p>Pay attention to what you early customers do, in particular the words that they use to describe the benefits of your offering. It will often give you a recipe for a niche. I note that neither ""stay in touch with overseas relatives"" or ""on-line scrapbook to keep in touch"" appear on your home page. You might spin it to incorporate one or both and reduce the generic language you are currently using.",1257374721

While it may be relatively new at the ""everyday person"" level, I think it's normal human behavior to consume more at least until a certain level of happiness is reached. In the past that level of consumption was only affordable to the wealthy, but it's now trickling down to everyone. There's a reason that WalMart is as popular as it is, and that's related to the reasons that most cloth is made in mills and not woven by hand anymore, and why I'm paid to write software and not to shape red hot iron on an anvil.<p>What that means is that it's pretty much going to be a force that you can't train or educate people out of. They simply want to live better, for their self-defined values of ""better.""<p>IOW: the solution won't be found in consuming less, it will be found in making it easier & cheaper to extract resources from the environment. I suspect a lot of the ""anti-overconsumption"" people realize this, but don't want to admit it.<p>As far as being defensive: I'm not. I <i>enjoy</i> having a large house, more vehicles than I really need and luxuries that would make a 19th century king envious.

I'm just trying to clarify the original point as to why people are pissy at GS and the other dealers.<p>Obviously there are nuances to this issue, but my point still stands. The masses aren't pissy because GS turns a profit (as implied by the OP).  They're pissy because they believe firms carry out unfair practices that allow them to game the system.  This is true.  To a degree.<p>One example: most dealers act as brokers for smaller institutional investors (hedge funds, mutual funds, etc.) and have visibility into their trading volume, including particularly large position movements.  Firms leverage this info for their own house positions and have a slight lead time against the market.  Intraday the gains may be slight, but over a year they amount to hundreds of millions in profit.<p>Given the size of their positions, firms can, and often do use their weight to manipulate market prices.<p>Then theres the issue with the govt bailout and TARP funds...<p><a href=""http://seekingalpha.com/instablog/225427-michael-j-golde/32385-goldman-bonuses-based-on-socialist-policies-not-capitalism"" rel=""nofollow"">http://seekingalpha.com/instablog/225427-michael-j-golde/323...</a>",1257373089

Do you have a counterexample?  What non-democratic form of government do you consider free?<p>I guess, in a larger sense, I take it as given that a democratic and free society is a basic requirement for human progress.  Do you think you'd get far with a startup in a less egalitarian society?  You might, but the fact that your grandfather didn't know the right people's grandfathers is going to really weigh you down.  It's only the basic assumption of equality of all people that make it possible for most to start <i>anything</i> new.  And I do take it for granted that everyone here believes that starting new things is the way to go.<p>So, OK, we can posit an egalitarian, ""free"" society where only an elite have political power.  I honestly don't believe that's an actual possibility - what's to stop the political elite from taxing you at 99% of your income as soon as they think your widget would be fun to have?<p>Nothing.<p>This probably deserves a lot more thought and space than I can fit in this margin.",1257372887

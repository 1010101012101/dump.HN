Individuals can exercise their will power and act in contradiction of any expectations they're aware of.<p>The real problem is that children fear negative reactions from their peers and therefore abstain from many activities that would benefit them. Even boys are discouraged from doing anything remotely 'nerdy.' Most children are too scared to face the ridicule and ostracision that comes with embracing uncool activities.

5352141,comment,5351557,5351557,2,0,seanalex,,,"I've been using C# for several years, and have bounced between it, Java, Node.js for my side-projects.  After all said and done, I keep coming back to C#.  I feel more productive and can design and churn out code quicker than say in a Node project.  Overall, I actually do enjoy coding in C# and using .NET more than any other language I have experienced so far.  The day I tried to use Drupal was the day I realized I made a serious mistake for not thinking I could do things better or quicker in C#/.Net instead.<p>Overall though, Microsoft is trying to move to an ""ecosystem"" platform.  Exampes are Nuget powering their closed/open-source ecosystem for projects and Azure server templates.  Even their latest ASP.NET MVC 4 is pushing several open source libraries onto their default project template.  They truly see they couldn't win the web battle with WPF/Silverlight as their only options, so they are going for a different angle here in the last year.  Additionally, a lot of interesting things are coming out of Microsoft and its employees, such as the open-sourced SignalR which is actively being updated and may become a standard for C# webapps.<p>I realize C#/.NET is not the go-to language for small web-apps yet, primarily due to licensing, but give it time.  I say if you are on the fence, and are interested at all in C#, give it a shot!  There are many free options for development IDE's and hosting provided by Microsoft.  For example, you can use Visual Studio Express and host up to ten websites for free on Azure.",1362927411

The fear of patent infringement was likely the biggest issue VP8 had.  They've taken that off the table.<p>But saying they've won seems to imply that someone lost.  MPEG-LA didn't have to make a deal with them.  But they got enough money that is was worth it to them.  As far as they're concerned they get money from Google now, plus all the fees from everyone else.  That's a ""win"" for MPEG-LA.<p>Both Apple and MS pay for H264.  I'm sure both would be happy to not have to pay for a codec (although H264 will be around for a long time, even in the worst case).  Microsoft's position on VP8 has been pretty clear... they're not shipping it (but maybe will now), but aren't opposed to it.<p>This was a smart move.  But doesn't mean that there are winners and losers.  And certainly there was no bluff that was called.  Paying to license patents from a patent holder is hardly calling their bluff.",1362927082

This, I got over. I learned that it's just as idiotic to (de)value somebody for hating makeup as it is to (de)value somebody for loving it. I have friends of all kinds now and respect that everybody is different.<p>But my worldviews arenot shared by most women (or vice versa). And the most sexist things that have happened to me have been originated by other women who assumed I was like them. I have been cited for other people's agendas (which I disagree with), had my opinions devalued, I've been called sexist, I have been attacked, I have been told my experiences and viewpoint are ""wrong,"" etc. etc.<p>This doesn't do anything worse to <i>me</i> than annoy me, but I've seen it really hurt women and men who ""give more fucks"" than I do.<p>I understand that people are (mostly) trying to do good things with the women-only and women-focused stuff. But they are creating stereotypes of their own, sexism of a different flavor. Any kind of division based on demographics is going to create antagonism.<p>This is human nature. It can't be helped. But if they can't bear to discuss it, and admit it, they are no better than the men they claim are sexist.<p>And I know some troglodytes are going to take this as an attack (it's not), or a reason to ignore women (it's not), but blah blah blah it's not for them and it's not as if they need more ammunition because they invent their own reality anyway.<p>This post is for you reasonable people who are organizing or thinking about organizing women-focused events. Question whether the research supports your beliefs. Spot the bias in yourselves and be respectful.<p>PS  if I have a daughter, I will tell her ""YOU can do anything if you are willing to be smart, and work your tail off when other people slack."" And if I have a son, I will tell him ""YOU can do anything if you are willing to be smart, and work your tail off when other people slack.""

1. People are taught not to pay - When computers started proliferating India, it was almost 100% piracy. Apart from OEM bundled Windows it still is. TPB in India is the standard. When you ask consumers for money, they want a physical good because virtual should be free just like it has ever been on TPB. Apps do not sell.
2. Insane justice system - If someone just stole what you did and started selling it, it would take twenty years to to get justice. And that may not even happen if that person is influential.
3. Strange tax laws - The indirect taxation policy has loopholes. People can steal taxes, play bribes and remain a monopoly. It is not everyone's cup of tea, but those that are good at it are very rich in India. A lot of the rest promote leaving India as a good option.

I'd love to hear suggestions if you have the time.<p>I think the biggest problem for me isn't some attachment to Windows Server (I much prefer working on a Linux server), or some misplaced love for WebForms (ick!), but the C# language in general.<p>There are a lot of great dynamic language setups on Linux (Rails, various Python stacks, etc) which aren't bad or anything... but I always find working in a dynamic language to be a bit of a hindrance.  I've been writing a multiplayer game server in Go, and I can't even begin to list the hours of work compile-time type tests have saved me during early development as I constantly refactor.  But on the other hand, I wouldn't want to write a large ""business"" style web-app in Go (my day job), which really doesn't have a standards library tailored for it.<p>I also get the feeling that the dynamic language web-stacks suffer from relatively poor performance compared to the CLR, and for some of the clients I work with who need to do some fairly complex non-database processing, this wouldn't be a great thing.  Maybe this concern is unfounded though.<p>Perhaps Java is the closest match to .NET, both in style and in spirit.  But having done a fair amount of Java development for Android, Java just feels so clumsy and clunky...  The language isn't as nice, the tools aren't as nice, and the standard library just doesn't compare in terms of letting my express myself quickly and easily.<p>When one of my clients needs a web-app, I always go .NET.  These projects won't ever be scaling to millions of users, so server licensing really isn't an issue.  On the other hand, there will be lots of direction changes no matter the amount of planning, so static typing can be a God-send with the safety blanket it provides.  And C# really lets me write clean code more quickly than in anything else I've worked with.<p>If I we're creating a product for a start-up, I probably wouldn't go with it...  licensing costs would be an issue.  But then again, if I was running a start-up, hopefully it wouldn't be a relatively boring business-app that was best suited to something like .NET.  And if I were creating a product for a huge number of users, it'd be worth pouring in the development time to have a super high performance back-end in a language separate from the quick-to-add-features-to Ruby front-end.<p>But for my use case, I just haven't found a better option yet.  I'd love some suggestions though, because I'm not a big fan of Microsoft these days and wouldn't mind being less at-mercy of their platform.  Maybe my concerns are unfounded though, and I'm just stuck in what I know, but I do branch out a lot for personal projects.",1362924889

Interesting: My perception is the complete opposite, and I've actually found myself using Twitter (with Tweetbot) for tech news much more than HN lately. I think this is because Twitter uses the people I choose to follow to decide what to show me, whereas HN uses everybody, and to make a story popular with everybody it generally has to make people angry/mad/happy. That means that HN seems to have more and more polarizing stories reaching the front page, whereas Twitter seems more focused.",1362924454

508646,comment,508033,508154,0,0,indiejade,,,"Precisely.  Being ""relentlessly resourceful"" essentially boils down to a highly advanced game of Make Vs. Buy.  MacGyver would almost invariably always answer ""Make!""<p>PG's article also reminded me of a comment I posted on here awhile go regarding a question somebody asked about ""skimping"" on certain things:<p><i>Assuming that by ""skimp on"" you mean ""spend sparingly on a necessity,"" I'll preemptively refrain from rambling about what's probably not necessary for a tech startup.<p>Of course, one of my new hobbies, since making the voyage out here, has been to practice the wonderfully fun and interesting ""make vs buy"" comparison game. You can, and probably will have many opportunities to play this game as a startup founder. This game involves simply asking yourself and/or your team numerous questions of a basic logistical nature:<p>A) How much does X cost to make, if I get to (or have to, depending on the day) make it myself? B) How much does X cost to buy? C) What are the costs, inclusive of shipping/assembly, for scenarios A and B? D) Do I have anything that can be improvised or are there any possible substitutes that can serve the ultimate purpose of X (i.e. using a door as a desk) in the mean-time? E) How long can I ""live"" with the improvised substitute or the idea of an improvised substitute? F) How much of the actual value of X is imagined; that is, how much have my perceptions been influenced by hype or advertising?<p>Questions E and F can get complicated, as they relate quite a bit back to the original posit about ""necessities"" and such. Probably I'm too tired to go into them at the moment, so perhaps in the morning.<p>I therefore recommend being pretty weary of anything involving hidden ""lock-in"" costs resultant from usurping alternatives; for example, anything involving a contract probably fits into this category.<p>Regarding brand loyalty. . . remember that there's a big difference between purchasing actual quality and purchasing advertised ""quality."" When factoring in costs associated with advertising, the make vs. buy comparison game really can take a person full circle.</i><p>Original post:  <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=167896"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=167896</a>",1236617710

It doesn't look very good on such a minimalist site.<p>""Vivapixel helps you store and share your photos and videos !""<p>There shouldn't be a space before the exclamation point. Furthermore, there shouldn't be an exclamation point at all. You're not making us excited right now, you're selling your product. It looks better if you're confident enough to stick to a period.<p>The checkboxes look very generic. Why not use a font-specific checkbox, if you need checks at all?<p>Bold fonts to me suggest slovenliness. Any reason you can't use a normal font thickness, and experiment with sizes to emphasize?<p>Work on the quality of your writing. If you've got three bullet points, it helps if they're about equal in length. ""Crystal clear photos & videos"" is overlong and doesn't say anything: aren't all photos crystal clear online? Does crystal clear video mean HD? (I'd also tell you to hyphenate <i>crystal-clear</i>, but it would be better to go with another phrase entirely.) ""Safe and Fast"" should see the f in ""Fast"" lowercased. Furthermore, these aren't points you should be making. I don't think of photo sites as unsafe or slow. You bringing these up makes me wonder just how fast and safe you are. (It's like the proverbial restaurant that advertises ""Our meat doesn't come from cats."")<p>I notice all the photos up front were taken by Dave. Any chance of getting other photographers/some spoof accounts to look better? Also, for the love of Pete remove the border from that photo. Nothing adds to slightly disorienting clutter than vaguely noticeable borders around things that should remain borderless.<p>The ""create new account"" button isn't clickable. Make it so I can click that button.<p>Don't give us a tour using thumbnails on the front page. That's cluttered. If you had more going on, thumbnails would be fine, but as it is it looks pretty cluttered. Also, work on the spacing. If you've got to have thumbnails, give them some space. Don't jam text up against the photo. Again, work on spacing (between commas in the second thumbnail) and punctuation (the first thumbnail has a sentence that doesn't end in a period) and capitalization (a lot of offenders here).<p>There are a few other things - the spacing of the top links, the links in the footer - but those are minor compared to your main problem, which is that this splash page doesn't make me want to sign up. I don't see the advantage, beyond having a cool web site URL, to using this above Flickr.<p>Remember that a good design means convincing people they want to use you. Right now, that's not happening, and that's a problem.",1236616143

508615,comment,508465,508465,0,0,coffeemug,,,"I just received Kindle 2 as a birthday present a few days ago. I wrote a little review for some friends, here it is verbatum:<p>I know that some of you were considering getting it for yourselves, so let me write a little review. I hope it'll be helpful. I don't think I was ever driven to write a positive review for a product before. There are very few things in a consumer electronics world that I love enough\nto do it. (The only other product I can think of is the iPod touch, but I never wrote the review for that because that would be superfluous).<p>First, let me note that I'm probably the last guy on the planet to spot innovation. I wouldn't know innovation if it hit me in the face. When I first heard about YouTube I thought it was a stupid idea (who would want to watch a bunch of home videos?), I thought Facebook was stupid (I kind of still do, I don't see too much utility), I've been\nto MySpace once (just to see what all the fuss was about) and I still don't get Twitter. I love the iPod touch, but when people talk about the tremendous potential of the platform they lose me - there are thousands of applications in the app store and there isn't a single one I'm really tempted to buy (or even download for free).<p>Keeping this preamble in mind, it took me about ten minutes of playing with the Kindle to realize that it changes everything. One day it will devastate the paper industry and the publishing industry, and will turn information delivery on its head. One day Borders (along with dozens of entire industries and probably tens of thousands of companies) will brace itself as it files for Chapter 11, courtesy of Amazon Kindle.<p>Kindle's biggest benefit is also its downside - it is absolutely trivial to buy content from Amazon. Want Ernest Hemingway? Click. Oscar Wilde? Click. New York Times? Click. Wall St. Journal? Click. A shitty John Grisham knockoff? Click. Kindle is the Google of published information, except that it isn't free. You'll only see the credit card bill at the end of the month, and all of that money will go to Amazon. If you own a Kindle, you will buy from them more frequently that you could ever have imagined. (It's cheaper than regular books, though. No more paper to cut, pages to print, delivery trucks to fuel, and cardboard to package it all).<p>Now, there are many negative reviews online. Essentially, everything they say is true. Kindle isn't perfect in the same way that iPod touch is - there are interface quirks, hardware quirks, and service quirks that you can read about elsewhere. However, complaining about them would be like complaining about the Ford Model T - it comes in one color, it isn't powerful, or comfy, it's hard to find gas stations,\nand dozens of other quirks people undoubtedly complained about. But the Model T had one thing going for it - it was so much better than a horse and carriage that all of the other inconveniences paled in comparison[1].<p>The Kindle device and service contract will continue to evolve and improve, the UI will get more comfortable, the electronic paper will get better, the service will become more reasonable. When you use it you don't feel a sense of perfection you do when you use the iPod. But what it offers today is so good, all of the imperfections pale in comparison.<p>If you love reading and are thinking of getting it, do it and don't think about it twice. It's an amazing device, it's easily worth its price, and when you use it, although you won't feel a sense of perfection, you'll feel a sense of innovation you've probably never felt before. Get it, and you will hold in your hands a device that's similar in importance to the first printing press. Except it's not clumsy like the first printing press - it's already very very good.<p>I'll now go back to reading Ernest Hemingway stories.<p>[1] I am not comparing the feel of books to the feel of Kindle 2 here. I'm comparing the purchasing experience.",1236615974

But liberal democracies give us a forum to address that problem; that being recourse to our elected representatives. What you're advocating is a selective and self-serving lynching of certain industries.<p>As I mention elsewhere, if you don't agree with the music industry's practices or prices, then you have the right not to purchase (and listen!) to the music. Nobody's forcing you to listen to music -- you do it out of your own free volition because you <i>like</i> it, it gives you <i>pleasure</i>, it, in other words, has <i>value</i> for you. If you feel so strongly about the evils of the music industry that you can't fathom subsidizing some Big Bad Label by buying a CD or download of your favourite artist, pick up a guitar and play that whenever you want to hear music. But don't come here with some hare-brained argument that by stealing music you're doing a ""Good Thing"". That's just self-serving bullshit.",1236615166

508586,comment,508457,508457,0,0,the_me,,," There was a 1 hour interview where Karl Popper's ideas were investigated on ""Ideas: How to think about science"" from CBC.ca. <a href=""http://www.cbc.ca/ideas/features/science/index.html#episode24"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cbc.ca/ideas/features/science/index.html#episode2...</a> is the link.<p>It was the most intellectually stimulating interview I've heard in years. Pretty much all 24 hours of the series actually. I highly recommend it.<p>As an aside though, I have some criticism about this text:<p>>It is not only social scientists who would have to change their approach under elective modernism. If we are to choose the values that underpin scientific thinking to underpin society, scientists must think of themselves as moral leaders. But they must teach fallibility, not absolute truth. Whenever a scientist, acting in the name of science, cheats, cynically manipulates, claims to speak with the voice of capitalism, the voice of a god, or even the voice of a doctrinaire atheist, it diminishes not only science but the whole of our society.<p>Science's motto is ""On No Man's Word"".<p>> Science, then, can provide us with a set of values â€” not findings â€” for how to run our lives, and that includes our social and political lives. But it can do this only if we accept that assessing scientific findings is a far more difficult task than was once believed, and that those findings do not lead straight to political conclusions. Scientists can guide us only by admitting their weaknesses, and, concomitantly, when we outsiders judge scientists, we must do it not to the standard of truth, but to the much softer standard of expertise.<p>Science is not about moral values. Science needs to be regulated by moral values. Science is like a self assembling jigsaw puzzle. It needs to be directed. Just like we can make a conscious choice to investigate technologies of destruction instead of stem cell research. Just like we can subjugate genetic research into Monsanto's killer seeds.<p>I think all in all, I am paraphrasing ideas put forth in the afore-mentioned interviews...",1236614858

I regularly board high speed trains here in Europe with only random security checks (usually dogs roaming the stations).<p>Airplane security for all passengers came about primarily because of hijackings, and was later adapted (badly) to bombs and suicide tactics.  Planes are a more suitable target for these types of attacks because of many reasons, including the virtually unlimited amount of possible destinations (unfortunately also including the ground or buildings).   Even a small explosion on a plane can bring it down, and there is already an existing factor of fear when flying.<p>The current level of airline security is still ridiculous, given all of this, but it would be doubly so on a train system.  Hijacking a train is borderline pointless, crashing one into something is next to impossible, and derailing from on-board would be a pretty large challenge.  Trains are also at ground-level, which is less than ideal for hostage scenarios.<p>Trains are only a sexy target because they have a large number of people on them, and even then people are relatively spaced out along a long line.  In my opinion this makes them even less attractive to a terrorist than any other crowded space.",1236614430

I was working on the problem of distinguishing code from data in Windows executables -- which is not always easy because of the presence of computed jumps and multibyte instructions (even if you have a pretty good idea that you&#x27;re looking at code, you need to figure out exactly which byte it starts on).  I wrote a Bayesian analyzer that estimated the likelihood that a given byte was the beginning of an instruction, based on estimated instruction frequencies.  It worked very well despite the fact that my frequency estimates were SWAGs [0].  I&#x27;m sure it would have worked even better with actual statistics.<p>[0] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_Wild-Ass_Guess"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_Wild-Ass_Guess</a>",1435042652

My wife does courses as part of her Nursing practice and has to write papers full of citations in the modern style. You can&#x27;t even say it was a sunny day without referencing an official weather report. The thing is, most of the references you see in books and articles are to sources no more authoritative than the one citing them. If you&#x27;re dealing with research then yes, sources and standards of evidence are important, but in many cases it creates an illusion of authority.<p>This is an article on the Internet, not a historical thesis.

9762992,comment,9762194,9762194,0,0,Smerity,,,"Whilst I quite enjoy Go, one annoyance I have is that it seems there is no middle ground between alright performance using pure Go and great performance using Go with assembler. Many other languages allow you, if you contort it, to get good performance without leaving the language. In this code, it was at least well sourced (and hopefully battle tested) SSE3 assembler for the Galois field arithmetic.<p>I hit this repeatedly when writing a pet project govarint[1] which performs integer encoding and decoding. I don&#x27;t expect blazingly fast performance if I don&#x27;t use assembler, but bitwise operations are painfully slow compared to the equivalent in C. C would also win handsomely even if the compilers were equivalent due to no boxing. It&#x27;s also additional overhead that you now have two divergent code paths - the Go code (fallback in case you don&#x27;t have assembler for the architecture) and the assembler code - that would both need to be kept up to date and checked for bugs / errors / inconsistencies.<p>Am I missing something? I only ever see assembler checked in to repositories - is there a typical sane build process I&#x27;ve just not seen? Is it just a matter of waiting for the Go compiler to &quot;level up&quot; optimizations to match GCC/Clang? Or should I just learn to live with the fact that to code Go I&#x27;ll also need to reacquaint myself in assembler again?<p>[1]: <a href=""https://github.com/Smerity/govarint"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/Smerity/govarint</a>",1435042105

No.<p>Mobile is new and popular?  Yes, and at\none time in the US so were tacos.<p>New and popular are not nearly the same as\n<i>changing everything</i>.<p>=== Use a Smartphone?<p>Could I use a smartphone to buy from\nAmazon?  Yes.  Would I?  Very definitely,\nno!<p>Why not?<p>(1) If the user interface (UI) is a mobile\n<i>app</i> instead of a Web page, no thanks.<p>Why?  Because with a Web page and my Web\nbrowser and PC, I get to keep a copy of\nthe relevant Web pages I used in the\nshopping and buying.  And I very much want\nto keep that data for the future.<p>(2) Want to keep those copies of Web pages\non a mobile device?  Not a chance.<p>Why?  Because for such data, I want my PC\nwith its hardware and software.  I want\nthe Windows file system (NTFS), my text\neditor and its many macros, and my means\nof finding things in the file system.<p>My PC also gives me a large screen, a good\nkeyboard, a good printer, a mouse (I don&#x27;t\nwant to keep touching the screen -- in\nfact, my PC screen is not quite close\nenough for me to touch), ability to\nread/write CDs and DVDs, backup to a USB\ndevice, etc.<p>Do I want to backup to the cloud?  Not a\nchance.  I backup to local devices.<p>Why?  Because for cloud backup, money, a\ncloud bureaucracy, the Internet, spooks,\nand lawyers could get involved.<p>=== Business<p>My business is a Web site.  I&#x27;m developing\nthat on my PC, and will go live on a PC --\nin both cases, a PC, not a mobile device.<p>Mobile users of my Web site?  Sure:  My\nWeb pages should look and work fine on any\nmobile device with a Web browser up to\ndate as of, say, 10 years ago.<p>=== New Business for A16Z<p>It sounds like A16Z likes mobile because\nfor 2+ billion poor people smartphones are\ntheir first computer and are new and\npopular.<p>Okay, then, A16Z, here&#x27;s another business\nyou should like -- bar soap.  Also, of\ncourse, just from the OP, tooth brushes.\nNo way should we forget -- salt.  Okay, of\ncourse -- sugar.  Sure, one more -- toilet\npaper.  Naw, got to have one more, plastic\nknives, forks, spoons, and drinking cups.<p>Not to forget -- sell them batteries for\ntheir smartphones.  Maybe even solar panel\nrecharging for their smartphones!<p>Especially for A16Z, got to have one more\n-- sure, Kool Aid.<p>=== Summary<p>A computer is the most important tool in\nmy life.  Currently my PC is my computer.<p>A smartphone most definitely does not\nreplace my computer.<p>Actually, at present I have no use for a\nsmartphone, a cell phone, or a mobile\ndevice and, so, have none.<p>Actually some years ago a friend gave me a\ncell phone.  Once I turned it on, and some\ncomplicated dialog came up about my\nreading some contract and sending money.\nI turned the thing off and haven&#x27;t turned\nit back on since.<p>Or, my PC has a <i>network effect</i>:  It has\nall my data and means of entering,\nstoring, processing, communicating, and\nviewing data, all in one place.

This applied regardless of whether you were studying Civil Engineering, Electrical, Mechanical etc. This was alongside all the other first year courses we were required to take such as Chemistry, Physics, Calculus, Linear Algebra, Statics, Dynamics and all that.<p>First Semester we took Intro to Programming and Algorithms (CS1100 or something like that). We learnt everything from Binary notation, logic gates through to floating points, I went from not knowing any programming language to having a fair idea about how topics like recursion worked our last project was to write some code to walk a tree using recursion. I also learnt how to use Unix and recieved my lifelong love of Emacs (which we used in our tutorials) from this course.<p>Second Semester we had to take Software Engineering (CS 1110 I think). It covered waterfall model, version control, specifications, unit tests and more estoteric stuff like loop invariants and formal correctness. Our major project was to write an essay about the Arriane V rocket explosion. I really enjoyed CS 1100 class but CS 1110 effectively succeeded in boring me to tears. It was somehow supposed to give us a taste of real world software design. All it really did was encourage myself and many others not to take CS electives in later years.<p>My major was Materials Engineering I took mostly physics electives in the last year of my degree, which is kind of ironic now because I work pretty heavily with programs - my day job involves writing computer simulations. I learned most of the skills I need on the job (including the C programming language, databases/SQL etc.) I probably would have benefited from more formal training but my experience of university CS was so miserable I actively avoided it.",1435040254

I apologise for inadvertent selective quotation but he was trying to have his cake and eat it; to gain the credit for exposing the wrongdoing of others while withholding details of his own wrongdoing, thus distorting the evidential picture. Whistleblowing law is designed to let people in his situation bring down others by breaking the devil's pact of mutual downfall that would otherwise result, and so by definition to gain this unusual protection requires candid self-incrimination.",1297263462

2197561,comment,2196801,2197230,0,0,btilly,,,"In this case it is statistical regularity. :-)<p>The primes act very much like they were a random set of numbers with n having probability 1/log(n) of being prime.  (Mathematicians always mean ""natural log"" when they say log.)  Except, of course, that this is obviously false.  Because, for example, there is only one even prime.<p>It is more accurate to say that the primes act very much like they were {2} plus a random set of odd numbers with n having probability 2/log(n) of being prime if it is odd.    Except, of course, that this is obviously false.  Because, for example, there is only one prime that is divisible by 3.<p>One can continue refining this statement in the obvious way of special casing more and more primes.  Other than the obvious corrections that come from these refinements, anything that you'd conjecture from this description is either known to be true, or believed to be true.  The number of primes below n.  The number of primes below n in an arithmetic sequence.  The density of twin primes.  And so on, and so forth.<p>Now let's focus on the average of primes below n.  (Mathematicians call that number pi(n).)  If the primes all were independently random, then you'd expect that to be close to the sum, for i in 2 to n, of 1/log(i), which is approximately the integral from 2 to n of 1/log(x).  The usual name for that integral is li(x).  li(x) is approximately n/log(n).  This estimate is known to be true.  That's called the prime number theorem.<p>One of many equivalent forms of the Riemann Hypothesis is that pi(n) - li(n) is O(sqrt(n)).  From the ""random prime"" hypothesis we can see why this is reasonable.  It turns out that for large n, (pi(n) - li(n))/sqrt(li(n)) should follow a standard normal distribution.  From which it is easy to show that the Riemann Hypothesis should have 100% odds of being true.",1297263426
2197560,comment,2197231,2197231,0,0,kls,,,"I have been through it all, at two companies I was at early on in my career, the executive team lied to the employees until the day the doors closed and those who stuck around did not get their last weeks pay or severance. I have also been at a company that handled the matter just like Autodesk did. Basically telling everyone we are in the shit, if you want to leave now is the time to do so, but if you stick around and we succeed the rewards will be great. They made sure everyone knew when we where out of capital and that the doors would be closing on that day. I was amazed at the effect this had, the rats left the ship almost immediately when the ""whats in it for me"" was gone. This lifted some of the financial burden on the company and ended up giving the ""doers"" more runway. We ended up pivoting the product and selling the tech to a customer that made it an in house product. While it was not riches, fortune and adventure, all the stuck it out did receive far more than their pay and offers where extended for employment at the company that bought the tech. The moral is that I was surprised to see the best of the best stick it out, they did so because they know they could get a new job tomorrow and where unconcerned with the prospect of their employment ending, many of us felt secure in that fact that we knew when that end would come and could time our exit. Conversely at the other two companies I saw the talent leaving as soon as their was a hint as to the writing being on the wall. When you lie to people you establish a relationship where their is no loyalty and in a situation like a company on the ropes loyalty can mean the difference between survival and bankruptcy court.",1297263426

2197558,comment,2196850,2196850,0,0,swix,,,"God... I LOVE HTML5 and Javascript/CSS etc, I wrote a couple of PhoneGap based apps, and to be fair I think 70% of the apps in the apple app store (Not counting games) can be created using just HTML5, most are simple list/todo/map/location apps and so on.<p>I want to write only in HTML5 to be fair, why? Deploy to multiplatform with small changes, no Objective-C or Java headache ;-P , but... it just feels as if it's not quite there yet, we are missing a little bit of performance in JavascriptCore, for animations (CSS the accelerated transitions work quite well) heck you can even achieve smooth parallax scrolling with some (mostly) css tricks on mobilesafari/UI WebView.<p>Now what's really missing here is a standard animation container, instead of doing CSS-sprite animations by creating loops that modifies background-position on elements (which will awlays be slower) there should be some other thing that lets you generate an animation (As a sprite or whatever) then play it accelerated in the DOM or Canvas... instead of using javascript to do everything.<p>Canvas performance is still horrible, but perhaps when apple comes around add adds more natively hardware accelerated stuff for the canvas and so on we could do some neater stuff.\nWhats my point, you can develop the vast majority of ""apps"" with no problem what so ever for iPhone/Android with HTML5, you do need a ""FrameWork"" to deploy to the appstore, such as PhoneGap, but in the end it's basically javascript/css.<p>Games on the other hand is harder, we're still missing a standard animation container, performance amongst other things. Add WebGL on top of this and you can probably come up with some cool stuff, not sure if WebGL is supported on the latest iOS/Android?<p>For me, Javascript/CSS/HTML is the UI future of apps, the backend can be whatever, Java/Python/PHP/C++, but for UI stuff, Javascript/CSS just tastes damn good and gives you a lot of freedom... my 2 cents.",1297263391

The events were a good launchpad, however.  FWIW, my profits for this project (after costs of shirts, shipping, paypal fees etc) were in the low 4-figure range over a couple days.

The wealthy benefit more from this arrangement, and it's fair that they are taxed more as a result. I presume you're not arguing against the existence of the state, or the need for taxation for its upkeep.<p>Given the need for taxation, making taxation fair requires information about economic transactions. But there's a balance to be struck here: having the state be informed about the details of every transaction, tied to each individual, would probably be too dangerous for liberty. But on the other hand, lack of oversight will lead to evasion and free-riding. So it seems that it's best to put effort in investigation in proportion to detecting potential free-riders.<p>Large amounts of money held in opaque arrangements abroad would seem to me to have a high probability of abuse; and with the numbers of people involved being small, the instrumental loss of liberty in having these arrangements investigated seems to me small compared to the free-riding risk.<p>I also object to the argument you've used; it gives me a slimy feeling reading it. You've tried to drag in this notion of privacy and respect by association with ""professionals"", attorneys, priests and spouses (!), to what amounts to hired thugs protecting a box of valuables. Banks spend a lot on appearances because they need to give their customers the impression that they're safe places for their customers' money, but at the end of the day, they're out to extract as much of that money as they can.

2197445,comment,2196997,2196997,0,0,dolinsky,,,"Having been there a few times there are a few suggestions I'd like to put out there. The points here should take a very minimal amount of time (< 1 week combined) but they are meant to be easy ways of getting more mileage out of what you currently have.<p>#1. Move all of the non-db specific crons off of your db servers (those that don't specifically involve the rotation of logs/cleanup of tmp directories) and onto one of your web heads. There is nothing more painful then seeing your master db crash because of a cron job or other non-essential role on your db server. It's much easier to recover from / spin up a new web head if it crashes then to restart mysql after your master db crashes (a slave db is easier, but still more of a pain point than a web head).  If at all possible, since you're already on EC2, spin up a worker server just to perform these cron jobs (stats collection, db cleanup scripts, etc). EC2 affords you this kind of flexibility. Take it.<p>#2. Hooking into a CDN is very easy to do and can allow your web servers to offload the serving of static files. As an easy way of doing cache-busting set up a global version variable in your code that gets injected into each static url that's generated (so a request for cdn.mygengo.com/images/29384/bar.jpg would be rewritten to look for /images/bar.jpg on your web heads if and only if the cdn'd cache had either expired or the unique # had changed in the request).<p>#3 Set up some sort of perfomance monitoring if you haven't already. Almost every startups #1 pain point is the db server, specifically queries. It's great that you've been able to see such a vast improvement through adding indexes / cleaning up some queries, but as long as your data is growing you will need to continue to keep on top of your query logs as their impact footprint will change as the size of your data does.  Since you're on AWS, enabling Cloudwatch\nshould be very easy and provides the basics. You can then move onto implementing Nagios/Munin or look to something like Cloudwatch/ServerDensity for an in-the-cloud solution.<p>You also didn't mention anything about having a K/V system like Memcache or Redis (yes @antirez we all know Redis rocks and how dare I place it after Memcache ;) which can really take the load off your db servers.<p>Best of luck with continued growth.",1297261246

MongoDB has a number of documented issues under high load (esp. high write load), in some scenarios they can be worked around with reasonable trade-offs, in some they can't and Mongo needs to be replaced.<p>If there's one general thing to say about scaling then that you scale <i>applications</i>, not stacks. The stack will usually change in the process.",1297260367

I am forced to work in German on a Windows box now and it is really awful and frustrating. Not recommended at all. Not one bit.”<p>That’s interesting. I never thought about it but it makes a lot of sense. The problem with software is that you often need to know the exact translation, especially when you are looking for something in a menu. You might know a correct translation but it won’t help you if that’s not the particular translation the translator picked. The weird vocabulary software often uses only amplifies the problem.<p>That’s why switching from English Photoshop to German Photoshop (my native language is German) was so hard for me.",1297260359

988255,comment,988070,988070,0,0,edw519,,,"Great post.  A few more, off the top of my head:<p>Garbage Perpetuation Development (GPD) - You can't believe how bad the existing code base is, but you're afraid to open a can of worms, so everything you add to it is written in the same style.  For the rest of your life, you can say, ""It was like that when I got here.""<p>Mansion in the Quicksand Development (MQD) - The opposite of Garbage Perpetuation Development, you are so shocked by the poor quality of the existing code that you vow that you'd rather swallow razor blades that code the same way.  So you write a tight beautiful refactored masterpiece that will crash as soon as the underlying database loses its integrity (later tonight).<p>Defer to the Framework Development (DFD) - You're not sure how to tackle quite a few critical design/architecture issues, so you convince your boss to adopt the framework du jour and decide to ""let it handle it"".  As soon as someone needs something that the framework doesn't handle, you blame management for making such a myoptic technology decision and say that it can't be done.  You keep your job and get a new boss every two years.<p>Not Invented Here Development (NIHD) - The opposite of Defer to the Framework Development, as soon as you discover something the the current framework can't handle, you abandon it and write all you own routines.  Everything now works exactly as you want it, but with all the additional code to maintain, your backlog has just grown from 6 months to 2 years.<p>Whoever Screams Loudest Development (WSLD) - Just as the name implies, you work for the customer who screams the loudest.  If anyone screams louder, you drop everything and work on their project.<p>F-Bomb Development (FBD) - Whenever everyone is screaming so loud you can't hear anything, you work on the project of the customer who drops the most F Bombs.<p>Start Over Development (SOD) - A critical requirement cannot be supported by the current architecture, so you decide to rewrite it.  You spend 3 months designing the new architecture and then 6 months writing the new code.  You never finish because you're out of business.  Now you know what ""critical"" means.<p>Workaround Development (WAD) - The opposite of Start Over Development, you can make the current system do anything.  You are so clever with your extra algorithms, functions, and data bases.  Even with all your great variable naming and comments, six months later, you have no idea how anything works.<p>Code Generation Development (CGD) - You're so tired of writing the same code over and over, that you write a code generator to do it for you.  What used to take a week only takes a few hours with the new tool.  But you're no further ahead because 80% of your time is needed to enhance and maintain the code generator.<p>Infinite Prototyping Development (IPD) - Your customers and users are unable to describe or document their requirements.  So you spend lots of time with them understanding their business and when you're ready, you throw together a prototype.  They love it, but it needs just a few changes.  You keep making changes, but it always needs more.  It stays a prototype forever.  When the app crashes because of security or scaling issues, you're off the hook because, ""It's only a prototype.""<p>Infinite Analysis Development (IAD) - You never have to do anything because you never have specs.  Woo hoo!",1260470235
988254,comment,988088,988088,0,0,dabent,,,"I'll add mine here as I'm having a problem logging into Reddit.<p>Startup 1: a product for online shopping sites to use to help customers make complex purchasing decisions.  It was difficult to use (required user take a questionnaire) and was one more cost for ecommerce sites to consider.  I was there only for a short, 70-hour-a-week stint as a contractor.  The company and people seemed nice enough, but I've never seen a market for what they made.<p>Startup 2: Took a job as a manager of ""professional services"" (before I understood what that meant) for a business banking software startup.  It had VC cash and was burning through it faster than it was getting customers.  They sold, likely very cheaply, to a competitor eventually.  I'd have stayed longer, but the ""professional services"" essentially meant travel, contrary to what I understood in the interview, so I left fairly quickly.  The company just tried growing staff and office space faster than their revenues.  I don't really know how or if the founders did on the sale, but it wasn't the huge success hoped for.<p>Startup 3: Mine!  A rental listing site.  Partnered with a ""business"" guy who couldn't really offer much.  Went after a market just dripping with competitors, including rent.com, apartments.com and some guy named Craig.  Faced chicken/egg problem in multiple ways.  Hard to convince savvy landlords to list if no one else has.  Hard to convince savvy landlords to list if no renters visit the site.  Hard to convince renters to visit if no properties are on the site.  Hard to convince search engines to rank me for much if no listings on my new site.<p>#3 wasn't all bad.  I did get people to list and get organic traffic, but just not enough to sustain the project.  I worked the longest and learned the most from the rental site.  As a professional, coding a web app from CSS to the database, managing customers and system administration stretched me and helped me like nothing I'd done before.<p>And that's why I'm looking to make my future #4 a success. :-)",1260470200

The cost of information has been anchored at $0 repeatedly over the past decade, and we now use that reference point when deciding the monetary value of new info.<p>I think I was probably off the mark in my post.

I went back to work (as a consultant though) for a year after a major financial crunch off the last startup.<p>Going back to a 8 hr day job helped in many ways beyond finances<p>-structure<p>- a good routine<p>- minimal decision making on a daily basis (I mean things like should you let go of the employee, should you buy another server or manage with the same, calling up electricity backup repair etc)<p>- lesser stress levels<p>- social activity without feeling guilty of time spent.<p>- broader focus. You keep yourself open for more ideas.<p>The only feeling that would be odd is - control & speed.<p>As far as the working for others is concerned, I think you got to accept it. You are in a job for a purpose, it is not as exciting and rewarding but necessary. And it does has its benefits.",1260468799

Are there people out there who <i>didn't</i> know that Joel runs his website/forums/StackOverflow for Joel's benefit and not necessarily for the benefit of those who contribute?<p>I read a bunch of Joel's articles in college, then decided that his site wasn't the place for me.  I felt that I wasn't really learning anything new from him, and that the forum participants were rehashing really basic stuff that I'd already learned and wanted to move on from.  When it came time to get a job (which was right around Joel's big ""Great Programmers Work for Fog Creek"" push), I kinda laughed and figured that if I were really a great programmer, I'd rather go build search engines or financial models than bugtracking software.  So I just quietly applied to financial software startups, stopped reading JoS, and didn't make a big stink about it on the Internet.<p>I thought about not writing this comment because, as Raganwald notes, I'm being part of the problem and not part of the solution.  But I found my life got so much easier when I started worrying about <i>my</i> goals first and other people's second, rather than assuming other people were looking out for me and then feeling betrayed when it turned out they weren't.  That doesn't mean being an asshole or never lifting a finger to help someone.  It means that when I help someone out on the Internet, it's because I want to, and I don't expect Reputation or Karma or a job offer because of it.  They're nice if they happen, but not something to expect.",1260468366

The whole point of accounting fraud is <i>falsifying internal financial statements</i>. It is true that investment banks conduct diligence by looking at a company&#x27;s financials, but this is for valuation purposes -- i.e., analyzing how the company has performed relative to other comparable companies. Investment banks do not employ forensic accountants who specialize in sniffing out fraud; accounting firms do. The issues in question were the kind that would be discovered in the diligence process by competent accountants, not competent investment bankers.<p>> Also not recommending your client put in a collar after an all stock deal?

Right now they will need their Windows phone as well as a MS display dock, keyboard and mouse, and it will still all be useless unless they are able to find a monitor to plug into.

Or, if not, can you acquire your customers differently, at a point where they aren&#x27;t already habituated to doing things the bad old way?<p>Ultimately I would say your best bet is to get back to basics and spend a ton of time listening to customers and watching them use your product, and your competitors&#x27; products. You might have changed the wrong things about the design? Or maybe there&#x27;s some other pain point they actually have, but no one even thinks it&#x27;s possible to do things differently because they&#x27;re so used to the status quo.<p>I would also be very mindful of incentives of various people, including both the users and the purchasers. Users in workplaces don&#x27;t necessarily want something that is faster or more efficient to use (in a business setting they might have job secuirty, pay, andceven self-worth tied to knowing how to use a very complicated system). Buyers who aren&#x27;t users very often buy based on specs more than design or ease of use (easier to rationally explain decision to higher ups).

10996240,comment,10992640,10992640,0,0,geebee,,,"It&#x27;s a very difficult situation.  I know we spend a lot of time discussing this on HN, but I&#x27;m glad we do, this really is one of the biggest issues facing our industry.  We (software developers) essentially have to study for and pass a comprehensive whiteboard exam almost every time we apply for new job.  Alternatively, we may have to spend up to a day or more on a &quot;take-home&quot; exam.<p>I do think that Gayle Laakman McDowell (who wrote &quot;Cracking the Coding Interview&quot;) has written a couple of good posts on this topic.<p><a href=""http://www.gayle.com/blog/2015/6/10/developer-interviews-are-broken-and-you-cant-fix-it"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.gayle.com/blog/2015/6/10/developer-interviews-are...</a><p>It&#x27;s a pretty good roundup of the various interviewing approaches, and the problems with each.  I have some differences of opinion, but I agree with the overall point, which is that there really isn&#x27;t a great way to do this.  The in-person coding exam (I don&#x27;t like to call it an &quot;interview&quot; because I really do think it is more reasonable to call it an exam) at the whiteboard may not be the worst of a bunch of bad choices.<p>Here&#x27;s my main problem with all of this - it is extremely unpleasant, developers clearly don&#x27;t like it, employers acknowledge that it has a very high false negative rate… yet seem to see no connection between this and their own constant complaints about a &quot;shortage&quot; of software developers.<p>I do see my friends in other industries interview, and they don&#x27;t go through anything like this.  Lawyers, doctors, nurses, and actuaries (among others) certain do take exams, but they take those exams under much more controlled circumstances, where well understood degree programs and study paths prepare you for the exams you will be taking (even so, many people describe these exams as the most stressful academic experiences they&#x27;ve gone through).<p>All in all, I do think that this practice deters people from becoming software developers, staying in the field, or changing jobs.  It&#x27;s one of those things that makes individual sense for a single employer, but in aggregate takes a heavy toll on the field.<p>I do think some kind of highly respected professional accreditation could solve this problem (actuaries, for instance, must pass a rigorous exam on vector calculus, linear algebra, differential equations, and so forth), but I&#x27;m guessing that senior actuaries don&#x27;t have to do a tricky integration by parts during an interview.  Devs most definitely do.  Then again, I fully recognize that &quot;professionalization&quot; does come with serious risks (with a few edge case exceptions, anyone who wants to become a lawyer has to go through three years of law school at $100,000+ cost, and many many people feel this is excessive and is really there for regulatory capture/cartel building).<p>Again, there&#x27;s no perfect answer.  My only thing I can say with real conviction is that companies that engage in this kind of interview exam, accepting that it is stressful and produces a high false negative rate, really need to stop scratching their heads about the &quot;shortage&quot; of good candidates.  I find that a little hard to take.  I accept that there are good reasons to do these exams, but you must understand the role you have played in your own shortage when, by your own admission, your process weeds out lots of good candidates.<p>And one other thing - whatever the process, employers should not look for ways to push the inefficiencies of the interview process out onto the candidate.  Although I just didn&#x27;t study enough for my google interview exam (and who knows, I may not pass even if I took 6 months to study),  Google clearly spent the valuable time of its own engineers to interview me.  I&#x27;ve done a take-home exam where I spent 8+ hours, and honestly, I received so little feedback I have no idea if they even read it, it was a one-line brush off <i>a full month later</i> (&quot;we&#x27;ve decided not to proceed with your application at this time.&quot;).<p>Another good post from Gayle McDowell on this one:<p><a href=""http://www.gayle.com/blog/2013/09/18/companies-who-give-candidates-homework-assignments-knock-it-off"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.gayle.com/blog/2013/09/18/companies-who-give-cand...</a><p>That I won&#x27;t do anymore.

Check out some &quot;quirks&quot; from the Wikipedia page: <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Excel#Quirks"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Excel#Quirks</a>.<p>Some of the worst ones:<p>* Microsoft Excel will not open two documents with the same name and instead will display an error<p>* Excel includes January 0, 1900 and February 29, 1900, incorrectly treating 1900 as a leap year. The bug originated from Lotus 1-2-3, and was purposely implemented in Excel for the purpose of bug compatibility.<p>* Can&#x27;t handle dates before 1900<p>* Despite the use of 15-figure precision, Excel can display many more figures (up to thirty) upon user request. But the displayed figures are not those actually used in its computations, and so, for example, the difference of two numbers may differ from the difference of their displayed values.<p>In addition, it is completely useless for handling any type of delimited file. By default it supports csv. If you want to edit a pipe-delimited file, you have to dig into the language settings of Windows, change the default delimiter, and open the file. Then, you cannot edit comma-separated files without changing it back first. So, there&#x27;s no way to convert one to the other. Same problem with tab delimiters. EDIT: one person has mentioned the import data feature, but that doesn&#x27;t solve the problem. You cannot edit and save anything other than commas without changing the Windows language settings.<p>It also trims off leading zeros from fields in csv files. If you open a csv file with leading zeros in some rows (say, from ZIP codes or SSNs), they won&#x27;t be displayed in Excel. Then, when you save it, even without editing it, all the leading zeros will be gone.<p>It changes date formats. Save a csv file with a date in it in the format YYYY-MM-DD. Open in Excel: it&#x27;s displayed in MM/DD/YYYY. Hit Ctrl-S. Re-open the file in a text editor and you&#x27;ll see that the file has changed.<p>It also doesn&#x27;t preserve quotes correctly in csvs.<p>Besides all this, there are many other stupid terrible things about it, like changing behavior based on scroll lock (can you think of one other program that does this?), making it impossible to look at many tall rows using the mouse scroll wheel, etc.<p>Excel is easily one of Microsoft&#x27;s most egregious offenses in the world of software.",1454085167

10996150,comment,10992232,10995912,0,0,Silhouette,,,"<i>The supported lifespan of expensive software is generally spelled out.</i><p>Unfortunately that is far from universal. We have several software products with permanent licences that had 4+ figure costs, and none of them gave any specific indication of support at all. Often you only get these things set out in writing with an expensive support contract on top of your original purchase. However, if you&#x27;re spending literally thousands on a piece of software and that software proves to be fundamentally defective within a reasonable period, I think you should be (and in many cases, you probably legally are) entitled to fair compensation if the defect isn&#x27;t fixed and any significant resulting damage made good.<p><i>If you continue using the software after support has ended, you are by definition unsupported and I&#x27;d say absent any malicious damage or major negligence on the part of the manufacturer, any issues are on you.</i><p>Perhaps, but I&#x27;d argue that artificially nerfing the product so despite its permanent licence it can&#x27;t actually be used after a certain period of time <i>does</i> constitute &quot;malicious damage or major negligence&quot;.<p><i>You can&#x27;t buy a car and then expect that the manufacturer will be on the hook for an engine failure after the warranty period unless the failure is caused by major negligence or malicious design. Perpetual support is not something any other industry provides.</i><p>You&#x27;ve chosen an unfortunate example there. Safety recalls <i>are</i> pretty much an indefinite obligation in the auto industry, at least in my country. I have recent first-hand experience of this, and someone who apparently didn&#x27;t ensure the appropriate remedial work was carried out on some vehicles and so left a potentially fatal design problem unfixed is about to get formally investigated by the relevant government department.<p>It seems to me that software developers can&#x27;t reasonably be expected to provide indefinite, free of charge support in areas like compatibility with new hardware/OS/protocols that evolve over time. That compatibility probably wasn&#x27;t part of the original deal, unless this kind of support was explicitly included probably for some fixed time period.<p>However, for issues that are clearly fundamental defects in the product, such as serious security vulnerabilities, privacy leaks, data corruption bugs, or complete inability to use the product because something like an activation server is no longer available, it seems reasonable to me that we should treat these closer to the way we handle safety recalls on cars. Want to turn off your activation server after a couple of years? No problem, but you&#x27;re on the hook for either patching out the activation mechanism for all your customers or compensating them for the functionality they&#x27;re about to lose after they already paid for it.",1454084986

That verges on the mathematically impossible; it&#x27;s written in the very basic most elements of economics itself. I wasn&#x27;t kidding about the math completely failing if you don&#x27;t have it; the entire concept of trade breaks down [1] without diminishing marginal utility.<p>What&#x27;s more likely happening is that you&#x27;re seeing Newtonian physics equations and complaining that the equations &quot;neglect&quot; quantum mechanics. They don&#x27;t, really, they&#x27;re in there, they just aren&#x27;t obvious, and it breaks down when pushed too hard. (So non-obvious it took centuries to discover in this case, not relevant to the econ case.) If macroeconomic models don&#x27;t appear to have a term in them directly that says &quot;here&#x27;s diminishing marginal utility&quot;, it&#x27;s only because it&#x27;s so deeply in the foundation you can&#x27;t see it through the stuff built on it.<p>[1]: You might still get trade in a world without diminishing marginal value, but one in which you still have different personal valuations. However, instead of a world in which a lot of people have a little bit of everything, which is what we observe, you would get a world in which each individual has a lot of only the thing they value the most, having traded away everything else they have to everybody else to obtain that one thing they value most. If that sounds weird, well, yes, it <i>is</i> weird, because we can&#x27;t imagine not updating our value functions based on what we currently have; it&#x27;s so fundamental we literally can&#x27;t imagine not having it. Note: This is not &quot;wealth&quot; concentration... in fact what you think of as &quot;wealth&quot; doesn&#x27;t even exist in this world and it would indeed produce a world <i>beyond</i> desparately poor as these crazy people literally focus on food to the exclusion of water, or water to the exclusion of shelter, and so on.

Almost every single time they do things that can easily be accomplished with a loop and a tiny bit of string manipulation and, honestly, even if the regex was a little faster it&#x27;s unlikely to be so much faster than you need to make the micro-optimization of using regex instead of some looping.<p>I try to avoid regex where possible and in the event that I do need to use it I try to document it the best I can and to make sure it&#x27;s as simple as possible to avoid weird issues like this.",1454084632

But if in a network of radar the signal is reintercepted, then it is bad for the plane.<p>Also since 2000 it has been proven that the flight of a stealth plane above a normal &quot;cellular phone grid&quot; can be detected by the additional energy that it bounces back.<p>Still with networked radar, stealth planes can make &quot;holes&quot; of expected energy. (ionosphere does reflect a little part of energy, and stealth fighter makes &quot;shadows/holes&quot;) it may require bigger wavelength though.<p>With IR detection, plane still leaves energy traces (like air friction).<p>Stealthiness only value is in plane vs plane fight to diminish the electronic signature, thus a frontal stealth is more than enough.<p>Stealth is a costly arm race.

I will add that I always use TypeScript with --noImplicitAny which indeed does result with TypeScript DEMANDING type annotations for arguments. Of which you complained:<p>> Having to declare types on everything even if it&#x27;s just generics beats the productivity argument.<p>and to which I respond that<p>1. its not everything, just function arguments<p>2. its better to demand function argument types than to show unhelpful error locations.<p>Implicit any is (was) useful for the early migration phase of the project. At that point you (had to) rename everything from JS to TS to use the compiler, and would get a type error for every unannotated function (which might not be a type error at all). The TS team had to choose between:<p>1. spending a lot of time and effort to get proper deep unification like Flow&#x27;s working at acceptable performance in a single-threaded process, even without incremental recompilation, or<p>2. default to a loose &quot;type checker&quot; and provide a gradual tightening valve for users - at the cost of demanding a bit more annotations: for function arguments (and only if the function is not a part of a single expression or statement where the type can be inferred - e.g. types will be inferred for lambdas passed as function arguments)<p>(1) may have been worth it if it actually resulted with useful error messages, however as demonstrated above, it often doesn&#x27;t. So they went with (2), and I&#x27;m glad they did - otherwise I&#x27;d have to deal with mostly-unannotated TypeScript codebases that produce useless error messages every time you do some sort of refactoring, or enforce type annotations via conventions / code reviews / linters.<p>Flow&#x27;s inference is a beautiful marvel of engineering, really, and the type system avoided some legacy TS pitfalls (has safer treatment of nulls, proper union and intersection types from the start) but I&#x27;m afraid its not that big of a marvel of practicality.",1454083860

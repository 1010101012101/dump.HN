It was an itch I had to scratch.)<p>It may surprise you, but healthy adults don't differ much in terms of physical ability. If you measure watts output or steps per second or anything quantifiable, it's going to be less than an order of magnitude difference, never mind a 100x difference.<p>I can run 100 meters in 15 seconds. That's 6.7 meters per second. Usain Bolt can run 100 meters in 9 seconds. That's 11 meters per second. 11.11/6.67 = 1.67 times faster. If Usain could somehow cut 5 seconds off his time and do a 4-second 100 meter dash, he'd be moving along at 25 meters per second. That isn't quite 4x faster than me. Such a feat would certainly be much more than 4 times as <i>impressive</i> as me running, but it wouldn't be more than 4 times as fast.<p>If you used some other yardstick, you could come up with some other number. Usain Bolt is the fastest sprinter alive. That makes him one in 7 billion. There are likely millions of faster runners than me. I'm maybe one in 100. 7 billion divided by 100 is 70 million, therefore Usain Bolt is 70 million times better at sprinting than me.<p>Sound silly? I think so too.<p>When measuring programming ability, we don't grade on a curve. It doesn't matter how much (or little) effort you had to expend. All that matters is the result and how long it took.",1341403096

They are a hassle for web developers, and reality is the web moves so fast that what's supposed to be ""experimental"" may be very quickly put into production use. Removing them would not prevent changing the syntax of a CSS property. Prefixes are bad anyway because they ensure only 4 engines can be ahead of the curve, unless web developers decide another matters enough to add the prefix for it.<p>Edit: Actually, if we don't get rid of prefixes entirely, we should get rid specifically of vendor prefixes.

OpenLoopz was born.  While the initial release received a decent amount of interest (14K+ downloads overall) and maintained a 4.5 rating on the Android Market, the project was always a learning experience for me and it showed in the quality of the final app.  I received a great deal of positive feedback for the underlying concept, but understandably, the majority of users would not consider committing to OpenLoopz fully without support for some kind of server-side sync feature.<p>I always envisaged expanding OpenLoopz into a full service complete with a web-app, sync and support for other mobile platforms such as iOS, but in the early days it was always a bit of a pipe-dream to be honest.  I had to maintain a full-time job and for a good while I was only able to work on OpenLoopz now and then when I had some free time.<p>At one point around a year ago, I decided it was time to get serious. My brother became involved and we half-heartedly went down the investment path for a while without any success.  Despite setback after setback I decided to commit to the project and took several months out from my day job to work full-time on OpenLoopz, living on my savings.  Unfortunately, it all ended in disaster (http://goo.gl/LIlhe), but it was a great learning experience and I have come back much stronger this year (and hopefully a little wiser!).<p>Now that the Android app is finally released, I am looking for advice on ways to generate funds so I can potentially work full-time on development of the web-app/sync feature.  As crowdfunding seem to be all the rage at the moment I have been researching the various services.  Unfortunately, I cannot use KickStarter as I live outside the US (I am based in County Durham in the UK).  Out of the alternatives that support the UK, Indiegogo looks like the best to me so I am in the process of putting together a campaign on there - I figure its worth a try!  I would be very interested to hear from others regarding any experiences using alternative crowdfunding services and/or advice regarding other approaches to generating funds.<p>I am looking forward to any advice I can get from the HN community whether its constructive criticism/feedback regarding the app or advice on crowdfunding (or both!).<p>Thank you,\nPaul Drummond",1341402967

It's extremely easy to use and set up. Most starting programmers/developpers work on Windows. If you want to start developping on Ruby or Pythons you have two possibilities:<p>- Install linux, which (whatever you may think) is not easy for any newbie.<p>- Try to work out the Windows ports of your programming language of choice. In the case of ruby, you have to find windows installs for ruby, gems, bundler, rake, rails (or whatever app you want to use), git, probably cygwin, your webserver of choice, etc... Most of these elements are not made for the Windows ecosystem and the ports are usually pretty poorly documented.<p>If you use PHP, you just have to: 1. Install XAMPP. 2.

4198849,comment,4198271,4198271,4,0,Xylakant,,,"One major problem I see in this article is that the stats that are cited as ""proof"" that PHP is the most widespread language are skewed.<p>* The sample is not representative. It's the top 1 million according to alexa.<p>* The percentage cited is ""x percent of all pages that we can determine are..."" which skews heavily in favor of PHP since PHP exposes it's version by default at least in older versions while other languages such as ruby don't. The percentage of pages that turned up as ""unknown"" is not listed.<p>* They don't give an error margin for their stats.<p>* Same is true for the Content-Management Sites. It skews heavily in favor of wordpress because lots of sites do have a wordpress blog installed somewhere.<p>I do acknowledge that PHP is probably leading by market share, but I'm not convinced that it's as pronounced as Fabien wants us to believe.<p>Composer is a nice step forward, but it's still behind of what bundler can do. One of it's main problems is that it created a completely new package format, so you need a new package repo - now they're at a respectable 1900 packages. Bundler uses the regular rubygems packages and has the full list of over 40.000 gems available. All tools that used to work with gems still work. There's also a couple of features that it's missing (local overrides for development, binstubs, etc.) but I guess that's just catch-up work. That the commandline interface looks plain ugly is probably just personal preference (heck, why do I need to call 'php composer.phar' instead of 'composer'?) Last but least, it's pretty much a feature-wise copy of bundler - that's maybe ""on par"" but not ""the most awesome and best thing in existence"".<p>So yes, PHP has taken huge steps forward but it's still ugly.

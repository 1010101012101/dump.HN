There are sometimes when people burn the midnight oil, but in general Googlers don&#x27;t work 60hr weeks.<p>I think the primary difference may come down to a culture of secrecy. Openness breeds cross fertilization, couple that with very few restrictions on Googlers in working on side projects, open source，and collaborating outside Google and it it&#x27;s easy to see why so many Googlers are lured away by the allure of startups.<p>As for Googlers being unhappy with their projects, there&#x27;s two answers. One, google culture permits challenging your management and product vision even as far as calling out VPs, so people here are constantly voicing their criticisms instead of falling in line. That can breed dissatisfaction especially if your criticisms are later proven right.<p>The other is that Googlers switch products often when they get bored. It&#x27;s easy for people to get unhappy when you switch from development to maintenance. I think this is very healthy，enduring people working on a product are enthusiastic. If your jet collecting a paycheck while dreaming of more interesting stuff better to go do interesting stuff.<p>The level of secrecy and compartmentalization in Apple sounds like hell to me.",1433707076

9676153,comment,9675684,9676065,0,0,toomuchtodo,,,"> I think worst-case scenarios around climate change emphasize the need to productively develop all of mankind as quickly as possible. That probably means hundreds of new nuclear reactors being built. Worldwide. I see no effort anywhere for that to happen. Instead I see various proposals that always end up with expensive energy for poor people. This is only going to make the problem worse. We are going to take away the tools that poor people and nations need to grow capabilities to deal with things when they change. And while we&#x27;re doing it, we&#x27;re going to rob them and their children of a better future. It&#x27;s a solution that&#x27;s worse than the problem.<p>I really have to disagree with you. After reading about the decline in nuclear power across the world, the inability to get traction on Thorium-based LFTRs, and so forth, nuclear is not the answer. I mean, it <i>could</i> be if we as a species didn&#x27;t suck so terribly at managing it as an energy source. We are not that species yet (note we still keep a coal-fired generation plant operating near Congress in DC due to politics).<p>If you&#x27;d like to debate this in depth, check my profile; my email is there. The Earth Policy Institute (holla Lester Brown) has shown how quickly China is bringing online solar and wind generation resources that already outpace their nuclear generation capacity. Bloomberg reported Friday that the US is on track to add an additional 35 percent of solar capacity this year alone.<p>Nuclear plants, coal plants, all of these central generation facilities all require massive capital outlays, they require corporations to manage them, staff to run. Solar and wind require none of these (except utility-scale, there be a bit more work required there).<p>It&#x27;s simple, so very simple! We should be build solar and wind flat out as fast as possible, selling it to those who can afford it and giving it away to those who can&#x27;t.<p>Solar Electric Light Fund\n<a href=""http://self.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://self.org/</a><p>&quot;SELF&#x27;s mission is to design and implement solar energy solutions to assist the 1.5 billion people living in energy poverty with their economic, educational, health care and agricultural development.&quot;<p>Wind vs Nuclear in China: <a href=""http://www.earth-policy.org/data_highlights/2014/highlights45"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.earth-policy.org/data_highlights/2014/highlights4...</a><p>Bloomberg Article I mention: <a href=""http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-05-26/solar-as-fastest-growing-u-s-power-source-rivals-shale-boom"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-05-26/solar-as-f...</a><p>Deutsche Bank Predicts Grid Parity Of Solar Across All Fifty States in 2016: <a href=""http://cleantechnica.com/2014/10/29/solar-grid-parity-us-states-2016-says-deutsche-bank/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://cleantechnica.com/2014/10/29/solar-grid-parity-us-sta...</a>",1433707042

Look at the terms in this essay, which is admittedly a more balanced judgment. We have environmentalists and <i>anti-environmentalists</i>. Who that breathes does not like breathing? Are there folks who wish to poison themselves? Please, spare me the &quot;rich folks are out to destroy the planet on the backs of the poor&quot; argument. Everybody is an environmentalist, at least when it comes to being a living human. Political groups which have no logical opponents do not add productively to the public discourse.<p>2) The more energy and freedom poor people have, the better we all are. Poor workers with cars can drive to find jobs. Poor people without water can use energy to extract water from deep in the ground, the air, or the ocean. Poor people with cheap energy can rebuild houses, move, go to school, live a better life. More freedom and cheaper power to as many poor people as possible.<p>3) Intelligent carbon-based creatures that exist in dry areas of the habitable zone of solar systems will evolve into their intelligence based on the backs of millions of years of built up hydrocarbons. These creatures will release this energy by burning -- this is as natural as a fish swimming in the ocean. Is such a release part of The Great Filter? Or is such a release part of the inevitable journey from the swamp to the sky? I don&#x27;t think we have enough evidence to say one way or another. I am concerned by those who feel otherwise.<p>I think worst-case scenarios around climate change emphasize the need to productively develop all of mankind as quickly as possible. That probably means hundreds of new nuclear reactors being built. Worldwide. I see no effort anywhere for that to happen. Instead I see various proposals that always end up with expensive energy for poor people. This is only going to make the problem worse. We are going to take away the tools that poor people and nations need to grow capabilities to deal with things when they change.

I suspect some of the things that might be important for you users:<p>1) Unlimited usage or unlimited usage per month ->  Managing credits is an annoying experience for when I just want to share an article: I&#x27;ll have faster ways if the actual transaction is a hassle.  Paying once and forgetting about it adds a lot of value.  This could work with your original paid model or with a freemium model that includes an unlimited tier.<p>2) Better analytics to calibrate the use cases: How many articles were people using. Did you have a way to detect how many of the articles were actually being read?  I suspect that 1/day might be a very high free tier if people are switching to a mindset of: is this worth being my 1 article a day?  Or converting the cost of a paid article and asking &quot;do I want to pay X for sharing this to my kindle?&quot;<p>Other have made the point that a key aspect of freemium is viral growth.  Do you have any social sharing features that people would want to use -> Could you share an article to Kindle and/or Facebook + Twitter?  Could you get shares of your app in exchange for additional article shares to kindle?<p>If freemium was the right model it might end up at something like:<p>10 Initial Free shares\n1 share/week free\n3 shares/week free to device if also shared to a social network\nA Paid credits/usage tier\nA Paid Unlimited/time tier (monthly or weekly unlimited use pricing?)\nAnd Possibly a paid outright unlimited tier.<p>You&#x27;d want to measure and track analytics on how you get users. Something like web bounce links through your own analytics package on the way to the app store.<p>Here you actually have an interesting tradeoff:  You get less money per user which you hope to balance out by driving down CAC through large amounts of organic growth.<p>The purpose of freemium is seldom a try before you buy value proposition that makes sense for the company, it&#x27;s the ability to generate viral growth even out of users who never spend money.

Berlin is probably most famous today for his short book &quot;The Hedgehog and the Fox&quot; but his essays are really spectacular examples of the form in my opinion - intellectually demanding but always concrete and straightforward; learned but not pretentious. He&#x27;s arguing here that historical reasoning is basically a form of advanced common sense rather than something which can be founded on scientific principles; there&#x27;s also a digression about &quot;electronic brains&quot; that might be of interest:<p>&quot;Such a model or deductive schema is not much in evidence in normal historical writing; if only because the general propositions out of which it must be constructed, and which, if they existed, would require to be precisely formulated, turn out to be virtually impossible to specify. The general concepts that necessarily are employed by historians - notions like state or development or revolution or trend of opinion or economic decline or political power - enter into general propositions of far lesser range or dependability (or specifiability) than those that occur in even the least developed natural science worthy of its title. Such historical generalisations turn out too often to be tautological, or vague or inaccurate; &#x27;All power tends to corrupt&#x27;, &#x27;Every revolution is followed by a reaction&#x27;, &#x27;Change in the economic structure leads to novel forms of music and painting&#x27;, will yield, taken with some specified initial conditions, e.g. &#x27;Cromwell had a great deal of power&#x27; or &#x27;A revolution broke out in Russia in 1917&#x27; or &#x27;The United States went through a period of radical industrialisation&#x27;, scarcely any reliable historical or sociological deductions. What is lacking here is an interconnected tissue of generalisations which an electronic brain could mechanically apply to a situation mechanically specifiable as relevant. What occurs in historical thinking seems much more like the operation of commonsense, where we weave together various prima facie logically independent concepts and general propositions, and bring them to bear on a given situation as best we can. The capacity to do this successfully - the ability to &#x27;weave together&#x27;, &#x27;bring to bear&#x27; various concepts - is a skill, an empirical knack (sometimes called judgement) which electronic brains cannot be given by their manufacturers.&quot;<p>[0] <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=9674876"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=9674876</a>",1433704951

Sure, the top 10 apps in the apple store might be making good money, but most apps that charge $1.99 will most likely not pay a living wage to the people that created it.<p>The same thing happened to the music industry.  The total amount of revenue has dropped 10 fold since 1999.  I know a few independent artists and they can&#x27;t really make a living on just music anymore.  They need to sell t-shirts or have a day job.  So in the end, free music and file sharing has decreased the overall cost of music, but it really only hurt the small and independent artists.<p>Even look at things like Spotify.  1,000,000 plays nets an artists something like $100.<p>It has forced many artists to go with large labels because the large labels will take all of the risk and actually pay them some sort of a living while they are touring.<p>Software is going the same way.  With all of the open source out there (and more coming out every day), it has allowed companies to hire software mechanics for pennies instead of software engineers for a living wage.  Why?  Because all of the parts that need to be engineered are given out for free.  Development now in most businesses is mashing frameworks and libraries together.  It really doesn&#x27;t take a computer science education to get the job done.<p>Business owners are also becoming more tech savvy as the older generation retires.<p>I&#x27;ve never seen so many smart communities of people put themselves out of a job so quickly.<p>To me, apps are just an interfaces to a paid service, not the actual service itself.  So, I might have a service that you pay X amount of money to use and the app is something free that is thrown in as a benefit.",1433704736

But they seem to like it.<p>> It is not one of “Let’s conquer the world and become bazillionairres while we’re at it” — the Google culture — which is more prone to eventually jumping ship and creating a startup.<p>This feels more like Google propaganda.  My impression is that google folks seem to work a lot less (long hours its true, but less) than the Apple folks.  Unlike Apple I <i>only</i> know nerds at google -- no marketing or business folks, so it could be different.<p>But of my google friends there are two groups: the übernerds who get to work on whatever they like (basically research) and they seem to have a lot of fun. A bunch of them are former colleagues from PARC and MIT, so they are doing the same kind of work we did years ago -- probably Microsoft research is the same.<p>The rest are doing product work of some sort of another and none of them seem particularly happy.  A lot of them are on the market (I have hired a couple).  It feels like Google has reached the microsoft phase: they have two real cash cows and are struggling to find more.  Product managers have a lot of sway.  They aren&#x27;t really organized like an effective business.<p>Apple went through that mode and was within a few weeks of dying.  Luckily they debugged themselves.  My Apple friends, even those deep in the bowels of tools or drivers, amazingly are still super excited by the Apple products (I guess they would have given up by now if not).",1433704192

My advice is that when something doesn&#x27;t quite add up is to presume that I don&#x27;t have the big picture. If I were in your shoes, I&#x27;d wonder about how the business model drives behavior. Consulting is different from product development. Operations in a cost center are different than in a core revenue unit. Companies that compete on price are different than those that compete on specialized expertise and different from those who operate on socializing in the good old boy network.<p>This is the time to learn. It may be that you are working in a soul sucking workplace. But still reach for a deeper understanding not easy assumptions.<p>Good luck.",1433703730

The best code to re-use is something that hides lots of complexity yet has a simple interface.",1433703677

Please talk to someone, look for help, professional or not. Just talk to someone about these feelings. &quot;Nine out of ten people who attempt suicide and survive will not go on to die by suicide at a later date&quot; (<a href=""http://www.hsph.harvard.edu/means-matter/means-matter/survival/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.hsph.harvard.edu/means-matter/means-matter/surviv...</a>), which shows that what seems like an existencial crisis tied to your identity is often an acute crisis tied to current circumstances, which can and will go away.

That&#x27;s really shitty and in an ideal world people would treat you as an individual, and not as a representative of a disease.<p>> John Forbes Nash Jr<p>That&#x27;s not really fair - John Nash was an exceptional person in a myriad of different ways. He&#x27;s very much an exceptional case in the same way that Stephen Hawking is very much an exception when it comes to ALS.<p>In general, it&#x27;s a pretty poor idea to confront someone suffering from disorganized thinking caused by schizophrenia about that disorganized thinking (maybe not in a clinical context, I wouldn&#x27;t know). Just because John Nash was able to function to a high degree without medication doesn&#x27;t mean that everyone will be able to, or that it&#x27;s fair to hold everyone to that standard.",1433703659

I've worked in many places and have come across the same thing.  As a c++ programmer I have also worked with c# coders and am often shocked at their slap-dash approach to software engineering.
I'm not saying they're all like that but it seems to be a common trend in my opinion!",1308574793

2673894,comment,2672854,2673756,4,0,ColinWright,,,"Ah - I see.  Thanks for the clarification.  You see, when you wrote:<p><pre><code>    ... you can't be bothered to read more than
    five words before formulating an opinion ...
</code></pre>
... it sounded a lot like you were annoyed, bordering perhaps on being outraged.  To be annoyed, or even simply disappointed, with things that simply are the case seems illogical.  Research suggests that rapid formation of opinion is the norm.  You were disappointed/annoyed/outraged/whatever.  To be so is perhaps reasonable, but certainly counter-indicated.<p>(BTW - I've taken the opportunity to remove the grammatical error - hope you don't mind.)<p>Perhaps I shouldn't've used the word ""contradiction,"" but since you were insisting that treating writings as pure logic is wrong, I thought it not inappropriate.  ""My bad"" seems to be the recent vernacular for that.<p>With regards agreeing that the analogy is poorly chosen, and whether I have anything to say to add to that, you said this:<p><pre><code>    I agree that Derek's analogy was poorly chosen for
    his audience. Clearly, he should have anticipated
    that people would be pedantic enough to bikeshed
    over whether or not fish actually realize they are
    in water.
</code></pre>
Then here you say:<p><pre><code>    Two hours ago I conceded the analogy was
    poorly chosen. I'm not sure what else you
    have to say.
</code></pre>
There is more than one way for an analogy to be poorly chosen.<p>Let P be the point you want to make.  Let A be the situation you want to use as an analogy.  Let f be the mapping from A to P.  You understand, of course, that I'm using these purely for convenience of expression, and not because I want to be mathematically precise.<p>Then we have f:A->P.  There are several things we want of a good analogy.<p>The analogy A should be something we are familiar with and agree with, thereby making it easier to see the point that is in it.<p>The mapping should carry that point into the new situation, thereby forming the necessary association.<p>Another point is that f should in some sense be ""natural"" and not excessively tortured.<p>But to me, above all, <i>A should be true!</i><p>So there's more than one aspect of the poor chosenedness of an analogy.  One is when it doesn't assist the point.  One is when it's too tortured to be effective.  And one is when it simply isn't true.<p>To me, that makes the opening comments more than just bike-shedding.<p>And that actually brings me to the main reason I wrote this additional comment.<p>You write:<p><pre><code>    How is it odd, exactly, to be disappointed that
    people form opinions based on knee-jerk reactions
    rather than thoughtful consideration?
</code></pre>
I don't think it's odd to be disappointed.  I think it's perfectly reasonable.  It's odd to take a stance that it shouldn't be otherwise.  Perhaps you don't.<p>But in all this my point is that ...<p><i>Good writing takes that into account and works with it, not against it.</i><p>The analogy was poorly chosen - we agree.  That makes using it an example of bad writing.  Good communicators need to avoid such mistakes, and understanding the thought and emotional processes inherent in their readers can help.<p>Your very first comment in this thread was:<p><pre><code>    It's an analogy, not a logical conditional.
</code></pre>
I was trying to demonstrate that that's not really the point.  The point is that for many of his expected audience it's actually an <i>actively bad</i> analogy.  Giving the author credit and trying to work out how it could be a good analogy - which is what's expected of good authors - is what leads down the never ending, unfulfilling, pointless meanderings about logic versus language, knee-jerk reactions, disappointment that things are the way they are, and so on.<p>Let's see if we agree on these:<p>* Good writing is hard.<p>* Working at it is worth-while.<p>* Having people point out your mistakes is of value.<p>* Bad analogies can detract from the effectiveness of a piece.<p>* Internet debates often get side-tracked down pointless side-issues.<p>* People form opinions (disappointingly) quickly<p>* Good writing takes that into account and tries to use it positively.<p>* Logic and language don't always play nice.<p>* We agree about more than we disagree on.",1308574008

2673862,story,,,7,20,bartonfink,"Ask HN: Emigrating Down Under",,"Hi, everyone -<p>My wife and I have been discussing leaving the U.S. to emigrate for an extended period of time (10+ years). We have a new baby, and while we're not looking to leave immediately, we're hoping to depart sometime in the next two to five years.<p>Our primary consideration is that we're looking for a place where English is a primary spoken language. My wife and I also speak conversational German, and although we're not averse to learning another language, we'd really prefer to not learn one unnecessarily. Secondly, my wife intends to get her Ph. D (or equivalent) studying religion in early Japan, and as such, relatively easy geographic access to Japan is something we're looking for. Finally, it's got to be somewhere with some form of a software industry so I can actually earn a living and not be a deadbeat immigrant. Of course, all of these considerations hinge on the assumption that a place that meets them will also be safe and able to provide an adequate (""first world"") standard of safety and care for the baby. Two countries that are very high on our list are Australia and New Zealand. That's not an exhaustive list, but anywhere else would have to fit the constraints above.<p>I have three ?'s that come to mind about possible locations. Like I said above, the two primary countries we're investigating are Australia and New Zealand, but I'm open to other suggestions. I was hoping that someone in the HN community might either live in one of those countries or be familiar enough with the immigration process and the culture to shed some light on this and give us some pointers while we're laying the groundwork for eventual emigration. The three ?'s are:<p>1.) What are our prospects for staying abroad long-term? Assuming my wife gets admitted to something like a Ph. D program, she's probably going to be eligible for some kind of student visa, but I'm not sure what that entails w/r/t me being able to work or for our daughter being able to enroll in school. I'm not completely averse to switching citizenships if necessary, but that's a last resort. There's very little tying us to the U.S. except the accident of our births here, so we're hoping that this move will be nearly permanent. What are our chances for that?<p>2.) What's the equivalent to the American Ph. D in said country? In Australia, it looks like you don't earn a Ph. D per se. Rather, you seem to earn some sort of post-grad diploma by independent research or coursework. My wife's ultimate goal is to teach at the collegiate level, and the traditional approach for this in the U.S. is to earn a Ph. D (which entails a sizeable research component under an advisor). Other countries have colleges with highly educated faculties, but the bit of research I've done on her behalf suggests that they come from different processes than we're familiar with in the U.S. What is the equivalent to a Ph. D, and the academic career prospects it provides?<p>3.) What's the best way for me to scout jobs overseas? This relocation is a long-term project, so I'd have plenty of time to spend. I wouldn't even mind making a career move here in the U.S. to facilitate the jump. However, I'm curious what the best ways to approach the problem are. Working remotely for a company in, e.g., the U.S. is an option I'd happily consider, but I'd want exceptional stability before I staked my emigration on that. Again, I have a family and I'm not particularly interested in interrupting their lives and dragging them around the world without something fairly stable on the other side.<p>tl; dr - has anyone here emigrated from the U.S. for an extended period of time? What did you do that made the process easier or harder? What would you recommend for someone looking to do the same?",1308573405

5983224,comment,5982313,5983016,9,0,dnautics,,,"No, they are probably using evanescent wave technology.  Fiber optics works by reflecting the light down a channel - when light hits an interface between media with two different speed of lights, there is a reflective component and a refractive component.  If you solve snell&#x27;s law for a very shallow beam hitting a less dense media, you get an imaginary value for the angle of the refractive component.  One way to interpret this is that zero of the light energy is reflected.  But if you solve a wave function cos(x) with an complex value x, that is equivalent to a function with a complex exponential, potentially with nonzero, real preexponential.<p>That is what an evanescent wave is.  There is light that decays exponentially &quot;bleeding&quot; off the reflective surface[1].  The snell&#x27;s law solution is sort of a hack, what is really going on has to do with the quantum wavefunction of the photon ensembles, but the result is the same.<p>Biologists use evanescent waves to do microscopy - you can illuminate an area of low density underneath your coverslip, and effectively a very very thin layer of flourescence is illuminated right above the coverslip.<p>It would seem reasonable that the NSA would use exactly this technology to tap fiber optic cables without splicing them, and it should be nearly undetectable.  There will be a nonzero loss of photons if you tap it, but it should be relatively negligible.<p>[1]note - the photonic energy is just &#x27;there&#x27; as in the wavefunction has nonzero amplitude in that spatial region.  It&#x27;s &#x27;bleeding&#x27; into the space outside of the fiber optic channel, but it&#x27;s not actually bleeding energy, there is no energy loss from this &#x27;spatial bleeding&#x27;, unless there is something in that zone that is capable of absorbing that photonic energy.",1372841148

Running Reader as a &quot;side project&quot; is not just distracting to senior management, but also creates legal, technical, and reputation risks which can bite back on their much larger businesses.<p>It&#x27;s hard for most of us to comprehend, but ready-made revenues of a few million bucks, even if it was $100M (unlikely), is not of interest to Google unless it&#x27;s growing fast. Which RSS, isn&#x27;t.<p>Welcome to Extremistan. Black Swans like Google do things that aren&#x27;t intuitive.<p><i>&quot;The bigger problem is that theyve abandoned interoperability. RSS, semantic markup, microformats, and open APIs all enable interoperability&quot;</i><p>Yes. This is indeed the direction Google has been moving, and it&#x27;s a problem for those of us who enjoyed an open web, as users <i>and</i> developers.<p>Google tried to combat Facebook with open standards and it didn&#x27;t work. OpenSocial, if anyone remembers, was a huge effort by Google which would have the effect of commoditising Facebook&#x27;s functionality. They put themselves on the line by partnering with many other companies, and it failed to slow Facebook down.<p>They tried with other standards too, e.g. PubSubHubbub, WebFinger. Most people have never heard of them.<p>There&#x27;s no conspiracy theory needed here. Google tried with Reader too, for 8 years. It just didn&#x27;t take off. Most people found it too hard and found Facebook + Twitter way easier. Not the kind of people who read HN, but the kind of people who are too busy to figure out what seem like trivial technologies to early adopter types.<p>So yes, Marco is absolutely correct that Google&#x27;s becoming a company that, like Facebook, is more interested in bringing developers in <i>after</i> their products have gained traction with users. This is also how Apple has acquired so much interest from developers; they didn&#x27;t open source their OS, they didn&#x27;t spend years constructing open standards for mobile apps. They just built a hugely popular OS and developers came running.<p>All of this is <i>related to</i> Google Reader, all of this is true. BUT there&#x27;s no causation here, as much as some people want to believe it. Reader didn&#x27;t take off because most people didn&#x27;t use it. For a giant company focused on growth, that&#x27;s all the reason you need to turn it off.",1372840773

It&#x27;s Twitter for people who don&#x27;t get 140 characters. I&#x27;d say the strategy is working, given the amount of G+ links I see. Personally I&#x27;m more interested in what my G+ links say than FB (because they&#x27;re interests of mine, not just IRL&#x27;ers talking about their nail polish), although I check both every so often.",1372838552

I&#x27;m telling you that the company that sells you milk doesn&#x27;t want you to drink anyone else&#x27;s milk because that&#x27;s how businesses work. They might sell some cheese too, but they also don&#x27;t want you eating anyone&#x27;s else&#x27;s cheese. Also, perhaps that is one of the founding ideas of capitalism, but our modern day version is far away from that. Capitalism screws people over by the day in America.",1372838551

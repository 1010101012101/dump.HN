As someone mentioned in the post, Julie posted some tweets in response to Github&#x27;s announcement today. (<a href=""https://twitter.com/nrrrdcore"" rel=""nofollow"">https://twitter.com/nrrrdcore</a>)<p>1. Bullying someone into quitting: Illegal.<p>2. Asking an employee to relay private conversations between her and her partner: Illegal.<p>3. Justifying the harassment of an employee because of her personal relationships: Pathetic.<p>4. How does it feel to make money for liars and cowards?<p>5. Pushing women with strong opinions out of your company because they disagree with you is wrong.<p>6. What number am I on? Oh yea, how do you sleep at night?<p>7. Leaving GitHub was the best decision of my life.<p>8. There was no investigation.<p>9. There was a series of conversations with a &quot;mediator&quot; who sought to relieve GitHub of any legal responsibility.<p>10. Whose reasoning included &quot;would it surprise you to hear that [your harasser] was well-liked?&quot;<p>11. No, no it would not.<p>12. Women at GitHub who sprang forward to defend the men who harassed me, it is naive to think the same thing cannot and will not happen to you.<p>13. Best of luck rolling the dice.<p>14. A company can never own you. They can&#x27;t tell you who to fuck or not fuck. And they can&#x27;t take away your voice.<p>15. Unless you let them.<p>16.

That&#x27;s fine, but most of these are highly regulated (e.g., utilities) and limit your returns.<p>2.) Invest in real estate. This is rent seeking at its finest. Henry George [1] addressed this issue, but his ideas have not been widely implemented (unlike Marx).<p>3.) Invest in government debt. I&#x27;m always surprised that people like Krugman and Piketty never bring this up, but the fastest way to reverse inequality would be to default on the national debt. The debt is just a transfer payment from tax payers to wealthy debt holders. It is almost like Feudalism.<p>4.) Buy and hold a nonperishable commodity.<p>Even your example, the housing market crash, is not an example of hording. In fact, it is the opposite. It is the squandering of capital. Piketty might even argue it was a good thing (like WWII) since it reduced inequality.

They fear that employees view them as disconnected and only trying to build empires of gold.<p>These are the fears of a bad founder. Their job is to set the vision of the company. If the founder fears the employees feel they are disconnected, the founder probably <i>is</i> disconnected. If a founder should fear anything, they should fear not creating a safe environment where the employees can feel comfortable bringing their concerns to superiors — about any aspect of the company — instead of that self-centered fear of being “misunderstood”.",1398120343

In that sense, I feel his work is more concrete than most economic research I&#x27;ve read, and it&#x27;s several orders of magnitude away from the typical economist op-ed with a single chart, and some cherry-picked data. His predictions for the future are pessimistic, and down the line they will certainly be at least partially verifiable. Only partially, because economies are huge and ghastly things, that we apply numbers to, but don&#x27;t really have a complete handle on. There are almost always enough extraneous or unaccounted for factors for an opposition group to claim an opposing viewpoint. I think part of the value from Piketty&#x27;s work is that he tries to account for as much of the data that is integral to his theories as possible (moreso than most economists).<p>Writing this has made me a bit thoughtful, so I&#x27;ll also take this an an opportunity to go off on a related personal tangent/ramble. Hopefully I don&#x27;t bore you too much, feel free to ignore.<p>I have always, always, been frustrated with economics. A field that is so divisive, but represents itself as a &quot;science&quot;, has always annoyed the hell out of me. However, my academic and professional track has brought me further into economics over time, rather than away. Right now I have a BS and MS in environmental science, and an MPA in energy policy. I&#x27;m nearly certain I want to pursue a PhD in the future, and it looks more and more like it will probably be in energy economics. One way I have calmed down my inner turmoil over this is to more frankly assess my economist and scientist sides.<p>Basically, the scientist is in love with raw, pure, data generation, while my inner economist is about using that data to generate a picture (or a graph, so many graphs). Another side to this is that my inner economist constantly wants to generate an interesting narrative and draw out the connections between trends, while my inner scientist tears down those hypotheses or works to find the data points which are not influenced by a &quot;narrative&quot;.<p>I&#x27;ve been happy on a lab bench centrifuging, pipetting, and doing PCR in the process of splicing soybean embryos, but I also enjoy sifting through census data and plotting $/kWh trends.

The solutions are largely reflected in existing regulations. The problems specifically associated with an upsurge in short term rentals in stable residential neighbourhoods largely did start with AirBnB and their competitors and their facilitation of illegal activity.<p>NYC is just one place where AirBnB operates and it is atypical in that it pits wealth against wealth. Most people in the US don&#x27;t have doormen and property managers to handle problems for them.<p>To be honest, the way to address the issue isn&#x27;t on the supply side, it&#x27;s by the demand side. AirBnB doesn&#x27;t really solve a problem most of the time - most of the time their are adequate hotel rooms available in most places. This means that the value proposition for travellers is much more cost sensitive than for black market hoteliers. They have alternatives and it doesn&#x27;t take much to make those alternatives more attractive than renting illegally, while appealing to the empathy of those renting is a losing proposition since they wouldn&#x27;t rent if they much cared how the neighbours felt about it.<p>And going after demand requires much less harsh measures. Fining the renter $200 a day plus a court appearance significantly shifts the value proposition if there is a substantial risk of being caught. On the other hand, the owner can roll small fines and attorney fees into the rents they collect.",1398118729

However, to complete the picture, you just have to add myriad ways of reading a single Chinese character in Japanese.<p>Being a foreigner lived in Japan for years, let me sum it up: Chinese writing system, Chinese-style construction of Chinese characters (have fun explaining how not, moon and sun adds up to mean bowel to me as in 腸, or tree + mouth = to be in trouble 困) and words (I haven’t met a person that will think of a log when say them “round and fat” 丸太, I also don’t know how “bad heart” can mean nausea 悪心).

Nihon-shiki romanization is also deeply flawed (I don’t know any language with Roman-based script that would spell shatyou as shachou in English), yet Japanese people are thought Nihon-shiki romanization instead of something that makes more sense such as Hepburn romanization.

Problem is: if you buy the house and ten years later find asbestos behind some wall, and the seller said it wasn&#x27;t there, he hangs, even if he couldn&#x27;t know of the problem. Of course, you can refuse to buy unless you get a 100% definite answer, but that would raise the price because the seller would have to do better inspection (possible destructive) and/or find insurance and/or would want money for the risk he takes.<p>The same applies to this outside firm: if they categorically state that there are no problems, but it later turns out that there are, they are target for litigation both from employees of the company and from the company itself (<i>&quot;you told us we didn&#x27;t have problems! but now our stock tanked&quot;</i>)<p>The best you likely can get is a detailed description of what they did in their research.

7624247,comment,7623364,7623364,9,0,firstOrder,,,"> We learned that unnamed employees felt pressured by Tom and me to work pro-bono for my nonprofit. We racked our brains trying to understand this new allegation...I am so very sorry if anyone felt that I was pressuring him or her for advice, labor, or to sign up. I truly never had that intention...my idealistic belief in the status-free community of GitHub, I failed to recognize that power structures cannot ever be obscured entirely.<p>> employees view them as disconnected and only trying to build empires of gold. Tom saw himself not as CEO, but as the architect of a unique business structure...He wanted to invest heavily in employees and to create a space that gave each employee the autonomy, tools, and support to build great things. In our home every night, he spoke passionately about how to build a company that gave employees freedom.<p>Other than being a Github user and customer, I know nothing of the details of this case other than what I&#x27;ve read.  She admits she was obtuse about &quot;power structures&quot; in the company, but this also is not a unique thing in Silicon Valley - she&#x27;s not blind to these things in a unique way.<p>That said - it&#x27;s like someone believing their own press releases.  &quot;A space that gave each employee the autonomy, tools, and support to build great things&quot;.  To me that sounds like saying Platt from &quot;Twelve Years a Slave&quot; got an excellent bag to pick cotton from, and build up the glorious plantation he was working on.  Preston-Warner can snap his fingers, and someone who was getting a check to put food on the table and a roof over their head is suddenly not going to have the rent check by the end of the month.  Especially when the next employer is asking for references, why you left the last job, are there any gaps in employment etc.  People on an H1-B visa are dependent upon the company so they can&#x27;t be thrown out of the country, so their green card application can not be restarted etc.<p>This is in the default structure of a corporation, and the laws, and all the default papers that super-angels and VC&#x27;s put forward.  Ownership and control of a corporation is 80-90% in the hands of the angels, VC&#x27;s and founders.  Of the scraps left over, executives and top-level experienced techs get the lion&#x27;s share.  This is the reality, and everyone knows it.  People believing their own press releases about people building great things are delusional.  It&#x27;s like the Tuskeegee or Dr. Mengele subjects happy about how they are helping contribute to science.  No one is fooled by this other than naive, new to the workplace, socially maladjusted programmers in their early 20&#x27;s.  This is why there is such a feeding frenzy over this small pool of naive young men.",1398117704

I travel frequently to NYC and have had great experiences staying with people renting out a part of their place. Right now though I&#x27;m 1.5 hours away from checking into my current Airbnb and I just got a call from a property management person about my check-in time. I noticed the email for the profile who owns the listing is bklynvacationrentals@gmail.com. I&#x27;m starting to doubt if the person in the profile is connected to the apartment and it kind of makes me nervous. I liked Airbnb when it was being used as intended but I might stop using it for my NY trips.",1398117653

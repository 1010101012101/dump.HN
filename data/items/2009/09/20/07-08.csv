NYT posts the bulk of their front page material online early in the morning. Usually 3-4AM Eastern. This usually includes editorials as well. I assume it goes live online when the articles are finalized for print. This isn't set in stone of course. So someone sleeping a normal schedule getting their paper at 7 or 8AM is seeing mostly fresh content.",1253433467

You make all the work, the other can only spot the obvious, and makes the sum way less than individual parts.

It was fantastic for the elite groups, but bad for the mediocre ones.<p>They mixed groups with good and mediocre people and it made the mediocre turn good, but the good didn't became elite.<p>So I think this has pros and cons, and is not for everyone.",1253432972

832863,comment,832475,832693,0,0,gruseom,,,"It works both ways. Sometimes I want to throw ideas around with a partner and other times I want to go deep inside an intuitive thought process. The key is to recognize what wants to happen at any given moment, and to have a culture that respects that flow. It really bugs me when people try to impose a predefined process on that. But it also bugs me when people come up with reasons to say co-programming isn't productive, when experience shows that it clearly often is.

832858,comment,832475,832632,0,0,akeefer,,,"I definitely agree . . . it's a fairly standard ""agile"" practice to make sure that product managers/""customers"" work closely with developers, but it's often not done that way.  The bottleneck at my company has historically been around seating; we have an open office plan with clusters of 4-6 desks, but even then you have to make tradeoffs around who sits near who, and we've historically put developers next to developers and product managers next to other product managers so that they could all talk and coordinate with each other.  That tends to mean the product managers are just far enough away from the developers that they don't talk much.<p>For our most recent development cycle (which started about 10 months ago), we finally bit the bullet and split the product team into cross-functional sub-teams we call ""pods"" consisting of (roughly) 5 developers, 3 QA, and 1 product manager.  Having the product manager sit literally next to the developers, instead of 15 or 20 feet away, has made a huge difference in the interaction there and our ability to quickly iterate on features.  Instead of just making assumptions when the product requirements are unclear or don't seem to make sense, we have much more of an ongoing dialog all day about how things should work, meaning we waste a lot less time building the wrong thing.",1253432238

But if you look at the process that actually occurred in this case, you'll find that this is very much not the textbook case of CAF abuse. This property was a real, practical problem for the community. The US Attorney's office used, in effect, a civil suit to resolve the problem after multiple local law enforcement interventions failed. That suit is receiving a full and fair hearing in front of an impartial judge.<p>Let me ask you directly: why do you think it should be illegal for the US Attorney's office to file a civil suit against the owners of a property that appears to be instrumental in the narcotics and vice trade of a whole township? If I slip and fall on your walkway, I can sue you. Why can't the government, here? They aren't threatening to imprison the owners. They're saying, ""hey, owners, your operation of this business is so negligent and creates so many costs to the neighborhood that after multiple interventions with local law enforcement we're finally forced to sue"".",1358636333

Two things I would add:\n-SF (vs say NYC,Boston,Chicago) is a one industry town and is therefore a boom and bust town. When I moved there right after the bubble burst the guy who sold me my car was a former dev. Many of you only know the good times, and it won't be like this forever. That's not to say its a great place and I don't miss it. \n- The cost of housing on the peninsula and to some extent the east bay is almost as bad as SF. When you are reqdy to have a family, at least in NYC you can live in a nice house in Westchester or NJ. Or a really nice modern condo for half the price of NY. You can't get a nice place with a good school district by going further away from SF, it's like prices get even worse the further south you go until you are way past San Jose.",1358636287

If an industry goes down because it can't compete with ""free"", then maybe it should go down because technology makes the business model unprofitable? Big players go down and small ones come to rule the game, it's not like people stop caring about entertainment. But of course this all whining about piracy is exactly about securing people's <i>own</i> position and ability to survive in the competitive market. After all, an industry-wide collapse could very well mean loss of a job(not for a single person, but also for co-workers etc) or at least huge cut in income.<p>In the end it's just everyone playing for themselves.

That's fine, I'm just trying to understand why you comment the way you do.<p>UPDATE: I think I see now what my issue is. Whenever the goverment does something wrong, you tend to do two things:<p>1. You write many, many lines where you point out how great the government is, what a good job they're doing, etc. It's all very ""pro-government"" and mostly, actually, off topic.<p>2. You then, at the end, or frequently in some later comment, claim you disagree (sometimes even in ALL CAPS) with the thing the government actually did that was wrong that everyone else is talking about.<p>So, when people are upset with the government for, say, civil forfeiture, you don't talk about that. Instead, you talk about everything <i>else</i> you can come up with to make the government (or in this case, Ortiz) look good.<p>I guess that's why I see you as ""pro-government"" with your comments.

(Imagine stripes of varying frequency and direction instead of sine waves of various frequencies.)<p>Sharp edges in an image have high frequency components, just like a sharp transition in an audio signal. Filtering the high frequencies will blur the image, while filtering low frequencies will enhance edges.<p>This is very oversimplified, but will hopefully give you a bit of an idea.

They tend to foster used book stores, certain kinds of hobby stores (comic stores, gaming stores, etc), museums and other ""intellectual elite"" things that you often cannot find in other towns of similar size or cannot find at all elsewhere or cannot find the same quality thus people will drive farther to go there.<p>I lived in Manhattan Kansas at one time. It was about 50k population with about 11k students and 5k faculty and staff. It was awesome. It had used book stores, two art stores at the mall (one of which sold the works of local artists so they could make a living), and two ""children's museums"" to give the kids an intellectually enriching alternative to Chuck E Cheese. People who lived in the state capital an hour away (a much larger city) would book birthday parties and the like at the children's museum. We also had a small zoo which was in many ways better than the larger zoo in the capital.<p>A big university attracts people who will spend time and money on intellectual activities.

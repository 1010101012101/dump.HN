The camera measures your pulse by reading the difference in &quot;color&quot; or &quot;density&quot; of your blood reflecting into the camera as your Harry beats.<p>It&#x27;s not medical grade in accuracy but holds up well in comparison with the heart rate testers at the local grocery store or manual pulse counting.<p>My rough estimate is this method is accurate to a few percentage points of a real medical device.<p>For those iOS and Android developers  would it be possible to detect body temperature to accuracy levels of that of a thermometer ( +/- 0.1 degrees ) using this battery method they are using for the weather?<p>It would be nice to check your temperature without the need for external hardware. Though even external hardware could be a great device, checking pulse, pressure, temp, and storing all data for historical analytics. Add in that you could compare that data worldwide and flu estimations may become possible. At least outbreak areas should be able to be narrowed somewhat. There&#x27;s a ton of other data that could be gathered too. Just mapping outbreaks would be interesting to see how seasonal ailments migrate. Even allergies could be mapped.<p>Thoughts?",1376528202

Foreign persons aren&#x27;t allowed around the mission systems aircraft without an escort, and aren&#x27;t supposed to even see the panoramic display in the cockpit. But what do you do when it&#x27;s a night shift and the only flight systems engineer on duty who is officially qualified to perform certain operations is from the UK? You get a piece of foam, cut it to the size and shape of the display, and write &quot;BRIT BLOCKER&quot; on it in sharpie, and use it whenever the Brits are around.<p>Further absurdity kicked in when some of the first jets built specifically for the UK were tested. Those jets had the full avionics systems, of course, which meant that foreigners couldn&#x27;t work on them.

When it comes to embedded systems nothing would beat C in near future especially those systems where safety matters.<p>The lab I am working with explores different ways to code robotic and embedded systems. From MIT&#x27;s SCRATCH to Erlang we have used them all. One of the area that we have been exploring is of using functional programming languages to program embedded systems. (For example we coded a robosoccer using Erlang).<p>Being a Javascript enthusiast I always wanted to be able to write small JS programs that I could use to control hardware. Given that JS has good support for Functional programming languages as well, I wanted to try that as well.<p>There is no doubt that people are expecting too much from Javascript but I do believe this is a very novel attempt that I see a point in supporting. I do not think JS is a language that will find application in say automotive systems but it can certainly be used to program robosoccer in my lab.",1376527407

Company X has a product Y and it&#x27;s selling for price $Z.  But product Y actually costs $A to sell (a single instance to a customer) -- fully loaded -- including cost of marketing, cost of sales, cost of implementation, etc.  When Z < A, you&#x27;re in real trouble as you try to scale.  (This is called &quot;selling dollar bills for 90 cents&quot;... or 50 cents, or 5 cents.)<p>The answer, of course, is to raise price until Z > A.

And, they have done that for decades. Software has the same vectors of improvement and shows a similar growth of form factors. Consumer software, as it is now, is only ~40 years old.

6215382,comment,6215219,6215219,71,0,ngoldbaum,,,"copy/pasted for readability:<p>Hi everyone,
I work for Valve (<a href=""http://www.valvesoftware.com/company/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.valvesoftware.com/company/</a>). We would like to make our digital distribution platform Steam (www.steampowered.com<<a href=""http://www.steampowered.com>"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.steampowered.com></a>) one of the places where you can download Blender. The long-term goal would be to make it easier for people to build their own mods for PC games with Blender and share these mods with other gamers.
So I was wondering if there are any Blender users on this list who are interested in PC games and could see themselves working on an integration between Blender and PC games that offer official modding support such as DOTA 2.<p>Long story:
Valve is a company that is built on modding. The original Half-Life was built on a modified version of the Quake engine. All our major games since then started out as mods which we found cool, hired the people who built them and released them as major game titles. This is true for Counter-Strike, the original Team Fortress, Day of Defeat and DOTA 2 (Portal was not technically a mod but a student project - but you see the pattern).
Similarly, one of the most successful features of our Steam platform is the Steam Workshop (<a href=""http://steamcommunity.com/workshop/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://steamcommunity.com/workshop/</a>), which is an interface for users to share, discover and install mods for their games. Essentially, you can publish your mod there and other gamers can bring your mod into their games with a single mouse click.
This is something that we think would be a cool feature for Blender to tap into.  Like modeling a sword in Blender, pushing a button and having it available to all users of Skyrim. But we bet there are more creative ideas out there than this one.
What we are currently looking at is offering a completely vanilla version of Blender as a free download on Steam that is completely the same as that offered on other websites. We&#x27;d hope that this will get enough of our users exposed to and interested in Blender so they will be inclined to work on Blender plugins that would talk to Steam&#x27;s backend services such as Workshop.
If you think you might be interested in being part of that, we&#x27;d be happy to hear from you!
Best,
Jan-Peter",1376526004

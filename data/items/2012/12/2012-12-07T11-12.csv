That, if we researched the moon with new scientific methods developed since the 70's it would not tell us <i>anything</i> new?<p>Sure, an economic benefits analysis may show out that we don't expect any (direct) breakthroughs coming from moon research that will be worth the money. Fair enough. But saying that it doesn't make sense is overly negative.<p>In the worst case it'd be an exercise in (applied) human space travel and closed life support, which is also far from a solved problem...

The mentality of many in government is scary.<p>The add in all the purchasing rules, inclusion of minority group requirements, cronyism, and more, and its no wonder why many projects are bound to cost more and have so much waste.<p>An example of all that is wrong in US projects at least can be summarized by looking that the rail project in California. They are so hell bent on doing something that anything will do which in the end means nothing gets done except a lot of money is expended.<p>Government has a spending problem in nearly all nations of this world.

4886547,comment,4884565,4885809,1,0,aneth4,,,"That's correct, except most of the companies that have not exited never will (many have already failed,) and it would take quite a few 100M+ exits to significantly skew that average.<p>Those assumptions could be wrong, but I don't think more than, say $1B in exits, can be expected from the existing YC companies, bringing the average YC exit to $4.5M - not much difference. Even an additional $5B in exits would only bring the average to $11.1M. Most of that would probably come from a few startups (think AirBNB), unfairly skewing the average further - we really should be talking about the much lower median.<p>Getting into YC brings the average from pitiful to poor. Note there is not a single 100M+ exit that has occurred from any other accelerator listed.<p>We also have to factor in founder dilution, which is usually massively higher in these big exits, and also that exits are split among the founders. The expected exit for an individual even going through YC is likely sub $1M taking those factors into account.<p>My point is not that startups are a bad choice. I am even an occasional angel investor. This does reinforce the frequently made observation that startups are not a guaranteed, or even likely, road to riches. Startups are for people who like startups.",1354881297

4886544,comment,4885610,4886338,1,0,qxcv,,,"> So in your opinion everybody who drinks in public always makes a mess? I go to the lake with friends and drink often, but we clean up and put it in one of the public bins.<p>I was a bit harsh on drinkers. It is more smokers whom I have a beef with. What I should have said is that I feel as though a consistent approach to regulation of where glassware can and cannot be used is required.<p>> Also one could argue that if the park is publicly owned it should be publicly cleaned.<p>Perhaps that might be possible where you live, but it would never happen in my city. Most people here (including myself, I admit) simply don't have the necessary motivation to pick up broken glass unless it's in a place where they can't afford to ignore it (a playground, for example). I cycle-commute each day, and there has been a broken bottle sitting on one of the roads I use for the better part of a few months. The road in question has relatively little vehicle traffic, but is next to a small University and is part of a major bicycle corridor used by hundreds of cyclists each day. It would be trivially easy for just about any of the people who pass it to try and dispose of it properly, but nobody ever does. Annoyances like broken glass, buckled footpaths, etc. tend to just be ignored until somebody gets hurt. I'm not convinced that it would be possible (at least, not in the short term) to get a large number of residents to voluntarily take responsibility for fixing problems which they did not cause.",1354881265

There are places where that's the best strategy.<p>But as soon as you're trying to do something unique or one-off or under-specified, bureaucracy impedes more than it helps. Which is probably why large bureaucratic organizations often get out-innovated by small organizations with far less resources at their disposal.<p>Bureaucracy is a solution to a coordination problem that I would argue doesn't really exist anymore. Software is, in one sense, bureaucracy codified in mechanical form. It replaces and obsoletes human bureaucracy. The classic bureaucrat essentially applies a rulebook to his input information and passes output information to someone else.

For example, they 'deactivate' applications that aren't being used, because they know they can restart them from SSD very quickly, which in turn frees up physical RAM, which speeds the computer up elsewhere.

It's extremely common for games to render lighting texture maps with HDR render targets. 16 bit-per-channel render targets are often used to accumulate excess light. The excess light gets processed by successful full screen pixel shader passes. These passes generally include blurring and flattening into a normal 8-bit-per-channel texture on the swap chain.<p>Furthermore, multiple render targets have been common since before the release of the Xbox 360. Deferred shading engines come into and out of popularity on what seems like a biyearly basis depending on what visual style is popular in games currently.<p>It seems to me that modern hardware is quite capable of greater color range, but the most demanding applications, games, would rather use that extra video RAM and fill rate for storing and processing surface normals, lighting scalars, material properties, etc. Desktop applications always lag behind games dramatically.

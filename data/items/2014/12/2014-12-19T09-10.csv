It didn&#x27;t hurt, but it was a strange shape: hard, white, conical, with a red dot in the middle.<p>The next few days I woke up with itchy bumps on my skin.  I thought they were mosquito bites.  I became obsessive about keeping the windows closed.<p>Through the next few months it got worse.  Huge swaths of them would appear across my arms and legs.  But when I went to show them to someone, they would be gone!  I discovered that they could come and go within a matter of hours.<p>At its worst, it would look like I was mauled by a tiger.  The mosquito bites would take winding paths down my legs, following veins and arteries in spidering patterns almost like red claw marks.<p>I went to a doctor, and they sent me to an allergy specialist.  They gave me an allergy panel, but only the pure histamine gave the bumpy itchy response.  The diagnosis: chronic idiopathic urticaria.  No cure.  Just hope it stops happening eventually.  Give it two years.<p>Well, it took two years to go away, but it&#x27;s gone now, I think.  It shows up again sometimes though, randomly, especially when I&#x27;m stressed.  The worst part is that it makes it harder to notice when I have other reasons to be itchy, which I&#x27;ve had many: pinworms, lice, jock itch.<p>Fortunately no bed bugs though!

I didn&#x27;t &quot;Get on the 486DX2&quot;, I got on &quot;the computer&quot;.<p>I&#x27;ve had so many questions about my story with people saying &quot;I call bullshit because he wasn&#x27;t able to remember (minor detail X)&quot; etc. It&#x27;s only through absolutely racking my brains to bits and insane amounts of googling, facebook messages to old friends and such that I&#x27;ve managed to answer a few of these. It&#x27;s good to know that my memory is not just deteriorating rapidly as I&#x27;d initially thought.<p>Some things stand out more than others. I was suspected of having ADD for a while, then the diagnosis was shifted to Aspergers Syndrome (something they apparently didn&#x27;t know much about back then, or was not as commonly diagnosed/referred to as it is nowadays), but a potential giveaway for this was that I had an eidetic memory for some things, and a lot of other stuff that should&#x27;ve been important but I didn&#x27;t care about was instantly discarded. I can remember down to a millimetre what few toys and possessions I owned, and what they looked like, yet I can&#x27;t remember what my own BEDROOM looked like because it wasn&#x27;t the bedroom itself, it was what interested me within it. The same went for most of my house, I barely remember what it looks like or what the furniture placement was. I put this down to perhaps some kind of mental block for traumatic memories. The old house appears in my dreams as a very very very large building and often in pitch black darkness so that I cannot really see what it looks like save for an insanely dim and flickering flashlight. I guess the mind has a funny way of dealing with inabilities to recall events.<p>Yet I can recreate in my head in incredible detail the structure of the school I attended as I spent quite a considerable amount of my time every day there, and I found the absolutely enormous building to be very interesting and different compared to the bland 1970s brick and tan buidings of my primary school years (I actually went on to recreate it in 3d from memory recently and was able to source some photos of it from the school themself).<p><a href=""http://i.imgur.com/eXb430f.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://i.imgur.com/eXb430f.jpg</a>
<a href=""http://i.imgur.com/BDpt6wt.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://i.imgur.com/BDpt6wt.jpg</a><p>And yet, I can&#x27;t remember how much RAM my system had, because it wasn&#x27;t of any interest to me. It was just &quot;the computer&quot; to me at the time, not &quot;the 486 DX2&quot;. Any time I would&#x27;ve seen how much memory the system had (I don&#x27;t recall if I even used the MEM command, assuming it existed in that version of DOS) but if I had, it would&#x27;ve been &quot;Oh I have X amount, okay&quot; and then I probably never checked it again.<p>I also don&#x27;t remember what exact games I had installed on the system, as I barely ever played most of them. I remember which ones I&#x27;d played at that point, but I do remember I definitely had Rise of the Triad shareware on there as it served as a key inspiration for writing a &quot;3d&quot; raycaster/FPS style engine. Interesting how selective memory can be, and how it will remember utterly useless details and points of information (or worse, remind you of the moments you did something embarassing or stupid) yet when it comes to crucial or vital events, it can draw a blank on something that was so striking to witness that you would think it would burn the image into your head for an eternity.",1418980946

8771539,comment,8770793,8770793,0,0,bane,,,"I&#x27;m about 20 years in on my career and can maybe provide a few observations:<p>- Outside of <i>very</i> few jobs, this article is absolutely correct. The few jobs that it really matters are ones where they won&#x27;t even look at your resume unless is has &quot;Harvard&quot; under &quot;Education&quot; on the resume for no set of reasons that have anything to do with the quality of the education. I leave it as an exercise to the reader as to if they really want to work in those kinds of places -- note: the burn-out rate on those places is usually around 2 years, then you&#x27;re out in the market with the plebs and a pretentious work history you&#x27;ll have to explain away for the rest of your life.<p>- Very early in your career, maybe the first 2-3 years, if you went to a top-tier private school you might receive a slight pay or position stats buff over your state schooled peers. If you went to a private school that wasn&#x27;t top-tier nobody will recognize it and it&#x27;ll be a waste of your money. Rule of thumb, if the private school you fight your way to get into and pay out the nose to attend isn&#x27;t immediately name recognizable, nobody will care in the slightest early in your career and it may as well have been the local commuter school later on.<p>- This stats buff goes away very fast and <i>hard</i> as your movement up the corporate ladder start to be based on factors other than the school you went to. After your initial 2-3 years, you&#x27;ll be expected to have learned the job and be able to perform at the working level. I&#x27;ve observed that there is almost no correlation between the best performers and the school they went to. If anything there might be a slight bias towards those that went to impersonal state schools since they&#x27;re used to not having their hand held. This is the hard lesson that places like Google are learning. One of the difficult things with being data driven is that when the data shows your state school grads do as well or better than your top-tier grads in the workplace, you have to pay attention. And the data has shown conclusively that it really doesn&#x27;t matter.<p>- By 10 years in, employers look for degree level (M.S. over B.S.) and possible field (relevant like Computer Science vs. irrelevant like Anthropology) and completely don&#x27;t care what school you went to in the slightest. Those that do, 10 years in on a career, are usually places you don&#x27;t want to work long-term.<p>- By 20 years in, you could have gone to the worst cow-poke state school in the country and nobody will care even in the slightest and your peers at that level will have educations from an impossibly diverse collection of schools.<p>- Many of my peers who graduated from a top-tier/private school realize that they&#x27;ll need to return for an M.A./M.S. or an M.B.A. at some point in their career to maintain upward momentum. Since they&#x27;re working at the same time this inevitably means going to the local state school. A comment I&#x27;ve heard over and over again is that state schools often don&#x27;t do as much hand holding and advising (degree counseling) as the privates and they often feel lost in the impersonal grind. Many of them drop out a year in because of this. If you end up here, don&#x27;t drop out, it&#x27;s not that hard, but state schools won&#x27;t treat you like a special snowflake.<p>- However, you can go to the <i>wrong</i> school. The big commercial for profit schools, like University of Phoenix or similar, <i>can</i> be a slight drag on your early career post-school and make it harder to hit career maximums. Companies like to fill up the &quot;Leadership&quot; page on their web site with people who went to well credentialed schools: state and private doesn&#x27;t make a difference, exploitive for-profit does.<p>- All of my peers with huge student debts went to private schools. 20 years in, I have peers <i>still</i> paying $200-500/mo to service their loans. That&#x27;s a car payment. The people who are debt free, and get to take on expensive hobbies, travel a lot, etc. are the ones who went to an in-state State School.<p>- People <i>agonize</i> over what school they&#x27;re going to go to for their undergraduate education, usually over <i>very</i> minor reputation differences. By 5 years into your career it won&#x27;t matter even in the slightest.<p>- The only people I&#x27;ve ever met who introduce themselves as &quot;I&#x27;m so and so and I went to <school>&quot; or say &quot;When I was at <school>&quot; instead of &quot;when I was in college&quot; went to an Ivy. Most people stop saying this pretentious nonsense about 10-15 years in because they&#x27;ll finally clue in on the social signal that it&#x27;s not impressive to anybody.<p>- If you have money to burn, and you want to carry cachet more than 10 years into your work, go to a well known overseas school like Oxford. You&#x27;ll get name recognition, tales of the foreign, etc. However, if you have to explain that &quot;I went to basically the Harvard of <insert country>&quot; you won&#x27;t get the same effect. Americans still think there&#x27;s some secret sauce that well known top-European schools impart on a student.<p>- If you went to school because of the great sportsball team, nobody gives two flying fannies about it when they&#x27;re hiring you. On the things that are important about you as a candidate, it&#x27;s at or near the absolute bottom of the list.<p>- Your in-career social network will be far more meaningful for you than the one you get from school.<p>- Spending the extra money to go to an out-of-state state school is almost always a complete waste of money. Just go to your local state school and use the difference to pay off your loans in a couple years or buy a car or something. It makes absolutely zero difference to your employer and slight reputation differences in programs won&#x27;t make that much difference once you&#x27;re out in the working world.",1418979722

4365480,comment,4360271,4360271,1,0,richardw,,,"I was working as a restaurant manager part time while at uni. One of the other managers thought it great fun to staple the back of my shirt without knowing, so when I got home I had a torn shirt.<p>That weekend, I fired up a 286 someone had given to me, coded up a mock-DOS environment, got the main manager on-side and left it set up for the next morning.  Next day...:<p>Start computer, get coffee. Type ""win"" (for Windows). Get 2000 random ascii characters with an error message. Typing ""dir"" produced an empty C:\ drive called ""F<i></i>* You Francois"". Anything you did pretty much got you ""bad command or file name"". Your manager (who is in on it) is shouting at you to get the computer going because his restaurant is starting up. You're typing out ""F<i></i>* You Francois"" as a password, looking for bits of paper around the office, trying to restart the computer but having the autoexec.bat put you back into it.<p>After about 2 hours, main manager types ""fix"", and the rest of your day continues, but with much added mockery.<p>It wasn't particularly sophisticated, but I truly loved that :) Lessons were learned.<p>We did something similar at school. Mocked up the Turbo Pascal UI with menus and everything, but was a bit...uh, erratic. Unfortunately the teacher knew exactly who it was and came storming into our next class :)",1344589037

Initial benchmarking on EC2 show you can test SRP passwords at a rate of ~180k / sec on c1.xlarge, at $0.66/hr per instance.<p>Particularly with Blizzards strange 'case-insensitive alphanumeric only' policy, anything less than truly random 8+ character passwords are within reach.<p>For 90% of their users, this spells trouble.  If you've seen John the Ripper, you know 'dictionary-targetable' is an increasingly ambiguous term.<p>My main point is that Blizzard is coming out and saying in their press release: ""We use Secure Remote Password protocol (SRP) to protect these passwords, which is designed to make it extremely difficult to extract the actual password""<p>And in their FAQ: ""Cryptographically scrambled versions of passwords for North American players were accessed, protected by Secure Remote Password (SRP) protocol.... The added layer of protection from SRP makes that process computationally very difficult and expensive.""<p>When what they SHOULD be saying is, ""we used industry standard best practices, but even so the majority of the passwords have most likely already been cracked.

4365460,comment,4365059,4365296,2,0,heja2009,,,"While I would consider Newtionian physics to be much more fundamental, I would challenge the notion that it had the most impact. Compare the ~1900 feeling that almost everything had already been invended. Newtonian physics impact to technology was mainly mechanics. Then came thermodynamics which gave us (steam &) combustion engines and more. Nuclear & quantum physics lead to bombs, reactors and finally seminconductors and so on. I would say todays thnological relevance of thermodynamics and quantum physics is at least as high as that of Newtonian physics. Also: most of todays physicists do not look for Bosons, they do things like advancing semiconductor masking technology, liquid crystal physics and the like - i.e. they are not ""fundamental"" but ""applied"" physicists.\nAlso - with respect to the original article - isn't the much faster exponential growth of the resources invested in science since around 1900 mostly an indicator of expected technological returns by society at large? Science is a huge economy success story since about a century ;-) The question then would be how long can we afford to sustain the current exponent?",1344588521

4365436,comment,4365255,4365255,14,0,cromwellian,,," before it started I knew it was going to be another typing rant. I think you continue to present a false dichotomy on typing, as well as missing some of the reasons people desire it.<p>In particular, I like typing as machine readable documentation, that makes IDEs simpler and more accurate in code navigation and refactoring. Dart in particular shows this false dichotomy really well, but having a type system for human and machine readable docs,  making the IDE experience far more pleasant, but which can be turned on or off. Unsound, untyped, programs can still run. Yes, dynamic languages can have nice IDEs too (Smalltalk), but they are harder to engineer.<p>In terms of optimization, typing is a must for many types of hard real time programming. You can bet that the Mars Curiosity rover isn't using a garbage collected dynamic language. Nor are the inner rendering loops of most mobile games or console games. (Lua is another story when it comes to actual game logic)<p>Lots of bold claims have been made for Javascript JITs for example over the years, include a lot of hype about tracing JITs, but the reality is, Javascript still doesn't even come close to native performance, and it's hideously slow on mobile platforms in comparisons, with basic, idiomatic programming (e.g. dictionaries with fields)  having terrible numeric performance. All this has actually served to threaten the Web with a native-takeover because we don't have a fast web language CPU and memory efficient on these devices.<p>I don't think that Tim Sweeney or John Carmack are prematurely optimizing when they decide to write a game engine(rendering) in C++, because experience has taught them that it is highly unlikely they'll be able to optimize a dynamic language implementation later to a satisfactory level.<p>I think many people use a mix of languages depending on the context. I certainly wouldn't write a web service in C++, nor would I write a 3D game in BASIC. I wouldn't use anything but Perl to masage text files, and I'd use R for data analysis. ",1344587877

It would take other scientists centuries to rediscover them and build on top.<p>Many discoveries come about by improving on and combining previous discoveries, so what needs to be improved to speed up science is better access, categorization and distribution of discoveries. And this is where I think a human-level AI would have an advantage over a human. Even if the AI is unable to retain more things in memory than a human it could clone itself and have an army of scientist AIs in charge of analyzing each new discovery and seeing how it might fit in with all other discoveries. Depending how resource-hungry the AI is we might be able have millions of brains working on every potential far-fetched hypothesis to see if it leads anywhere.

4365409,comment,4365255,4365255,18,0,tikhonj,,,"As Yegge mentioned in his post, this is a bit of an oversimplification. As a simple illustration, choosing a statically typed language like Java over Python is certainly a conservative trait. But then choosing Python over Haskell is exactly the same, just with the whole difference translated towards the liberal end of the spectrum.<p>Put another way, it's the political liberals who came up with OSHA (I hope--I'm somewhat ignorant of the actual history :P). A liberal or conservative outlook is not characterized by some particular processes or tools--it's characterized in an entirely <i>relative</i> way. The conservative approach is in choosing the familiar over the novel and in avoiding change. The familiar <i>could</i> be safer--Java vs Python--or it could be <i>less</i> safe--Java vs Haskell. I've talked to some ardent Java adherents, and they have lucid cases for not going over to Python or Ruby or Clojure or what have you. But--critically--these cases are virtually identical to their cases against going over to Haskell or Scala. There are differences in details, of course, but it's a difference in degree rather than kind.<p>Another even more extreme example is TDD. In particular, the arguments people have against adopting TDD are essentially exactly the same as I've seen from TDD supporters against using formal methods. Once again, some details differ, but the core idea seems to remain: some people are inherently wary of change.<p>It's also interesting to note how Yegge categorizes certain concepts in <i>multiple</i> ""buckets"". Either he's just being inconsistent (which is plausible) or he's making a deeper point: it's not about the particular concept, it's about the philosophy behind it. If he wasn't making that point, I've made it for him :).<p>That is, anything called ""something calculus"" is conservative, but lambdas (e.g. lambda calculus) aren't. Type-based functions overloading (like type classes, I guess) is conservative, but Scala implicits are liberal.<p>In my view, the languages that are the most conservative (at least in my part of the world) are Java and Python. Why? Simple: they are the default language for almost everyone I know. You're at an enterprisey company? You're probably using Java. You're at a startup? You're probably using Python. You're using C or Scheme or Haskell or Erlang? You're crazy. (I should note that I don't know very many people in systems or embedded programming, so my view is obviously rather biased.)<p>All this rambling (I certainly see why Yegge always writes <i>long</i> posts) has left me with a fairly concise conclusion. Namely, mapping programmer attitudes to a spectrum vaguely inspired by politics is a reasonable idea. Sure, the reality is that there is no total ordering so a one-dimensional representation is fundamentally lacking. However, it's good enough to give some insight.<p>But I would not map technologies there based on the technologies' innate traits. Rather, I would map them there based on the thinking behind the people who use them. This is similar to how--if you don't know the background--it's hard to guess which political party supports which regulation. Gun control is the opposite of liberal, but it's exclusively heralded by liberals; deregulation seems liberal but, of course, isn't. Yet, on other issues, people on either end of the spectrum behave as expected!<p>This is why I think languages like Java and Python are fairly conservative. Not because they try to offer some sort of safety but because they are safe <i>choices</i>. This is also why I would probably place C# as significantly more ""liberal"" than Java--it may be the most ""conservative"" .NET language, but it is far less afraid of embracing new ideas than Java. So that end is simple: at least for enterprisey companies and startups, it's populated with Python and Java. But what about the other end? I think this is where the languages that most people consider too crazy to use go. Haskell, Scheme, Erlang and so on. Only very brave--very <i>liberal</i>--companies are going to use Haskell or Scheme in actual production. Too many weird features. Even the sentence ""Scheme in production"" just sounds weird.<p>So it's not a matter of wanting handrails (Haskell) or not even wearing a helmet (Scheme); rather, it's a matter of being willing to choose something more advanced over something more understood.",1344587121

Otherwise, it's not and a waste of time and money.<p>Especially, if you think that a college degree provides you a guarantee to get and keep an employee job, or being successful in it, you are plain wrong.<p>The opinion of Paul Graham or Peter Thiel about college make sense when considering the goal they are talking about for which a college degree is indeed a waste of time and money.<p>A college degree is good to become educated in some field, but you are spoon fed and you get all the constrains that come with it.",1344586673

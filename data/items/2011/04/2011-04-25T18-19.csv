Learning entirely new skills is probably far more valuable at kickme444's level.  The situation can probably be framed as an exploration-exploitation tradeoff, in which getting more depth of programming knowledge is exploitation and picking up new skills is exploration.  Though exploration is typically blind; in this case, kickme444 is experiencing direct demand for his new people/product skills.  So I guess my two cents is that he's making the right move.",1303757921
2482456,comment,2481806,2482308,1,0,yummyfajitas,,,"Countries don't need to accumulate USD to participate in the oil trade [1], only liquidity providers do. If you live in China, and want to buy oil to produce widgets sold in Europe, you hold RMB and need to accept payment in EUR. So you trade RMB for USD, buy your oil, later on trade widgets for EUR, and then trade EUR for RMB (if you want dividends) or USD (to reinvest). The person selling the oil is probably going to trade the USD in for Rial's, Pesos or Loonies.<p>(The market maker captures 0.0002 USD in compensation for the adverse selection risk he takes on.)<p>The particular dollars being used for these purchases tend to be reused. They flow from the market maker to China, China to Saudi Arabia, and Saudi Arabia back to the market maker. This facilitates the real trade (oil + french wine in exchange for widgets), but is merely a bookkeeping mechanism.<p>The only person who needs to hold USD is the market maker.  They need to hold enough reserves so that normal variation (e.g., today 5 people buy USD, tomorrow only 3 sell) doesn't deplete their supply. I don't know that much about commodities markets, but this probably is a small fraction of all dollars out there.<p>None of this has anything to do with T-Bills. US bonds have low interest rates because the US government is believed to be highly unlikely to default.<p>[1] Many countries do accumulate dollars for other purposes. For example, they might accumulate a reserve of stable currencies as a hedge against hyperinflation. Or, as in the case of China, market manipulation.",1303757913

2482436,comment,2481806,2482263,8,0,ChuckMcM,,,"I believe the insight the author was after here was not a general comparison of Japan to China, rather that China's ""growth"" has a component to it which is artificial.<p>That artificial growth comes from reporting GDP on building things that nobody uses (like Cities). Conversely, like a large private corporation which doesn't have to reveal costs in any general accounting rules kind of way, China has the ability to create a view of their economy which is 'untrue.'<p>So put another way, the author posits that in a market economy the creation of a new city would be done by actors who were themselves creating more economic output as a result of productivity gains from having city infrastructure. Thus economists see new building as a leading indicator of economic growth. However if you simply spend a billion dollars to build a high rise office tower without any tenants or even a prospect of leasing it out, the 'leading indicator' aspect of that data point is completely wrong. The building will sit there empty, generating no economic growth whatsoever. There are hints that China is manipulating its figures in just that way.<p>The bigger challenge for China is that in the eastern part of the country the standard of living is growing much more rapidly than it is for people living in the western half of the country. The last time that happened Mao Tse Tung used it to his advantage to overthrow the incumbent government.",1303757649

So there is definitely interest.<p>Other than myself I haven't met anyone that can take a product from concept through production so you are going to need a huge contributor pool. Also it's not having the information but understanding the process and cultures your dealing with. As an example a couple months ago someone on here contacted me for an idea: the main components were an LCD and the processor. So I told him to find a manufacturer already using those parts and then design his product using their base system. That way he could get scale pricing without having to purchase huge quantities. With my experience I knew what the key components were for his concept, where to look, and who to call. I don't think you can replicate that information in a guide.<p>Sadly right now I'm too busy to help much.

I know most of you would say why even bother, just go with AWS. For me, the recent AWS outage has really put doubts into my mind about EBS and how persistence they are.<p>Personally, I have been using RackSpace cloud for some time. And I can share some of my experience with Rackspace Cloud, as well as what others have said.<p>If anyone knows of any other than RackSpace, please jump in and I'll update the main post<p>Rackspace Cloud
Rackspace has 2 physical locations in the US - ORD and DFW. Rackspace instances are VMs unless EC2. I know Posterous uses Rackspace Cloud http://www.rackspace.com/cloud/cloud_hosting_products/servers/compare/<p>PROs<p>1. Cheap - It's definitely cheaper than AWS. Since their lowest instance starts at 256MB, you can spin on up around $10/mth for working on less resource intensive tasks or for staging.<p>2. Better performance than AWS. 
http://scripting.com/stories/2011/04/14/rackspaceBeatsEc2ByALot.html<p>3. Rackspace instances are VMs, so you get dedicated resources like cpu, memory and storage unless ECS, you only get cpu and memory and no storage.<p>4. Great support. There's alway someone that I can talk to for support. Web chat, etc and AWS has zero-support by default.<p>5. Basic form of VM imaging so you can back up your instance daily to hourly and recover any failing instance using those images. AWS has no default recovery, you have to DIY although I believe there are many solutions readily available.<p>CONs<p>1. I tried looking up more information about their cloud stack information but couldn't find anything more than this
http://www.rackspace.com/cloud/cloud_hosting_products/servers/technology/<p>2. No matter which location you are at ORD and DFW, it's within one DC. So if that DC goes down, you are down. You can roll out servers at either locations or both, but inter-DC traffic goes over the internet. To change DC or start servers at other location still requires you to talk to a support personel.<p>3. Does not have the other nifty cloud services like SNS, SQS, SES, etc.",1303756510

Twenty ten especially was filled with energy and action; that's what got us there.<p>I've seen one thing consistently, we, as a movement, are getting older, smarter, and closer to our goals. Not unlike starting a startup in high school, you are bound to fail, but after 10 years of failing you learn a thing or two. The timeline for the passage of the bill is not some constant or range. It is a linear function of how smart we work and how much energy we put into it. If I learned one thing, is that Congress has absolutely zero interest in passing the bill, either party. They all just want to get elected again. You work from there.<p>If by ""too late for me,"" you are referring to the age limit in the bill, the Dream Act usually gets introduced without the limit and the 30 year old age limit is sometimes tacked on as a ""compromise"" in the process. Also, the number I keep seeing lately is 35, simply because its taking this long to pass the bill. I want the limit gone, it makes zero sense from any angle. It is only good for marketing the bill to hypocrites who'll never support it anyway, ""look only kids will benefit."" Fucking load of shit, we were kids when this mess started!! Just because you've been in legal limbo for 20 years, doesn't make you less American. Eh... You give a finger you get nothing, you give a hand, you get nothing, you give half your torso, and you still get nothing. That is the dynamic of party relations in the Senate right now. Democrats compromise, Republicans just keep saying ""No"" because that will get them elected. The age limit is a compromise not worth making and we'll make sure the Senators know about it. I see more and more people who are already over the proposed limits, they deserve this more than I.<p>Personally, I'm not ruling out ""going back."" Although, it's not really going back is it, its leaving everything and everyone you know behind to go to a place you barely remember, if at all. I have the same problem, not having done mandatory military service, I'd probably be arriving into a jail cell. That is unless I arrive after a certain age. The country of your origin may have a similar rule, look into it. Coincidentally, this is the strategy of our opposition, they call it ""attrition."" Make our lives so miserable that we leave on our own. Look at the AZ bill. Look at the Georgia bill that will be signed by the governor in a couple of days. We leave, they win. I don't know what they win exactly, you and I are clearly American and have something to contribute to society. But, I don't care about the principle of this thing much, I just want to breathe free for once (ironic isn't it.)<p>What helped me deal with this situation personally, is just not being afraid anymore. That sounds cliche, but something just snapped one night somewhere around the time where my friend was going to be deported (a few days later, Sen. Dick Durbin has personally acted to stop his deportation), and I just said you know what fuck it all. I know I'm worth something as a human being. I know I'm a competent ""product"" guy that loves what he does. If the worst thing that I have to be afraid of is getting shipped out clenching my American diploma, then fuck em. Ship me out and let me live my fucking life already. Or do what you have been doing and pretend that I don't exist. I'll be fine either way, so fuck you. You can see I was angry, not bitter, I think I have it easy compared to others and certainly the rest of the world, just angry. That night I made a pact with myself, fear will never be a factor again. It worked. Somehow accepting the possible consequences and not being afraid of them anymore has helped me get a grip on this situation emotionally. Over the years I've developed a really thick skin, nothing ever surprises me anymore. In addition, overcoming this fear -- I can't even say concretely what I was afraid of, it's just this perpetual state that you are in as an undocumented person -- has given me a ton of confidence. You want to bring me down? It will take you a lifetime; enjoy the ride.<p>So my advice is please do ALL you can to change your status, but if no avenues are available, do what you can to improve your quality of life. Come to some kind of an arrangement with your co-founders and keep going, keep doing what you love, live your life as fully as you possibly can, we are still incredibly fortunate.

Wufoo does about 1.5m in monthly uniques which is about $3.5m/yearly revenue.<p>On revenue comps, if we assume 5x-10x multiples, the purchase price implies a $3 to $7m/yr.<p>Based on the $30 plan being most popular, and 10% of users in the most expensive plan, I'm assuming a blended $52/mo or $624/yr per subscriber. With our $3m to $7m revenue range, that implies 5k to 11k paid users. With a 5% conversion from free to paid, that is about 100k to 200k free users. Which implies a 6%-12% visitor to registered user conversion based on their 1.5m visitors/mo.  Seems like in the range!<p>Finally, for returns, PG and Buchheit invested 100k for 10% (mixergy interview), and YC took 7%. So assuming a 20% option pool, and net of the angels, the 3 founder got $22m or about $1.5m/year.",1303756360

However, if you pay the rental fee every day for a year, it gets more and more expensive than an outright purchase.  The comparison largely depends on the time scale you look at.<p>The main reasons I'm aware of that provisioning dedicated servers take longer is because you have to deal with data center logistics.  Which rack does it go in? Which VLANs does it need to be in? What bandwidth is the customer paying for and how will we route the uplink? If the customer has other machines can we put these new ones in the same rack without overloading the PDU?<p>There's a lot of hidden work that goes into data center management.",1303755378

Even if the Chinese educational system only turns out rote memorizing robots incapable of the kind of creative, breakthrough leaps of discovery the West prides itself on and will never evolve due to cultural momentum and restraints (which I don't buy either but that's a whole nother argument), being economically dominant will enable China to build world-class research facilities and import world-class talent.<p>The US benefited from such a scientific talent immigration trend after WWII.  The European theoretical physics community is benefiting similarly from LHC and the short-sighted cancellation of SSC.  Any area of research that requires massive, long-term, blue-sky funding will be dominated by governments willing and able to provide it, and will attract the best talent from all over the world.<p>The major problems China will face in this instance will be the language barrier and reticence of some scientists to work for a more authoritarian, censoring government.  The former is easily solved, the latter is problematic but not insurmountable - even scientists have their price and plenty would convince themselves to work under such a regime in the exact same way Google did (change it for the better by 'engaging' it), especially when the alternative is a stagnant career and dead-end research due to lack of funding elsewhere.<p>This conceit that many in the US and West have that the quality of our science and research is innate and unimpeachable is both ignorant and complacent.

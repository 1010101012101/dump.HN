Since go uses an ad hoc product type, you always get an error value and the return value, even if they are mutually exclusive most of the time.<p>But multiple return values are there for much more than returned result and error. You conflate that with the specific use of returning result and error, and based on that, you claim that sum types are better. That's a straw man par excellence.",1370192392

I lived there from 2005-2008, and there were a few shopping malls, nothing crazy. Every 1-2 years I've gone back, there has been at least one or two new major shopping malls put up, and that's just in the few places I frequent around the city center.<p>Besides the philosophical question of whether it's a good thing for a city, I just don't understand the economics of it. How do all these places coexist? Where does the demand and up-front money come from? Is there actually real demand at all, or is it just completely manufactured/delusional (build it and they will come!)? When I lived there, people's shopping needs seemed fulfilled, and the population has flatlined since then [1]. I heard tell of some EU grants involved. Overall, it just doesn't seem sustainable from an economic perspective, even in the short-term.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.citypopulation.de/php/poland-zachodniopomorskie.php?cityid=3262011"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.citypopulation.de/php/poland-zachodniopomorskie.p...</a>",1370192258

5809184,comment,5807941,5808799,32,0,venus,,,"> protesting something I call ""Singaporification.""<p>I love how people always cast Singapore as some kind of  horror story cautionary tale. No-one seems to have told the actual people of Singapore, who are perfectly free to leave their nightmarish dystopia at any time, and yet seem perversely inclined to stay. Somehow this obvious, central, crucial fact gets left out of the ""we don't want to turn out like Singapore!"" narrative.<p>I think the real reason people demonise Singapore isn't because it's a bad place to live; it's because it is actually a really good place to live, and this fact causes a certain conflict in the libertarian mind, a fundamental undermining of the whole axiomic structure of their beliefs and no-one wants to face that. So, instead, they try to villify it in vague terms of being some kind of anti-freedom devil state - a North Korea that, by Satan's blessing, works.<p>I'll tell you the really scary thing about Singapore. It's a better place to live than 99.9% of these so-called ""freedom"" countries. I'd live there over any city in America bar maybe NYC, and certainly over Istanbul. The scary thing is that, when you consider the outcome, maybe the Singapore formula is a better form of government, and a lot of people don't even want to contemplate that.",1370192059

5809179,comment,5808151,5808151,5,0,alephnil,,,"Norway have plenty of tech startups. It is just that most of them are in the oil technology and oil services, and very few are in the IT business. In fact, the oil technology business is the second largest industry in Norway after oil production itself, and I think that is the case even when only the part that is exported is counted. Besides that, Norway only import about 15% of the equipment needed for oil production and exploration, while many other oil producing Nations import most equipment.<p>The problem for Norwegian startup founders is that they have to compete with the oil industry as well as said oil service industry for the best people. Since both of these are insanely lucrative, it is hard for web and other IT-related startup to afford the salaries the oil related companies can pay. In Oslo you have less of that kind of industry, but on the other hand, bloated administrations of the government and said oil companies that makes it similary lucrative to get into IT consulting rather than doing startups.<p>The result is that there is little incentive for an engineer to start a web and other IT-related startups in Norway.",1370192041

I believe I found the contract on dice.com, which also helped me find other contracts. I already had experience building software for my parents' company, and had built some of my own sites, including CGI stuff that I had to pay $125/month for a shared account for, back in those days! I didn't realize what my market rate should be on the first contract. I then got recruited away by a startup to help build the first online yellow pages site. HP asked to make a counter-offer but I (foolishly) didn't let them. After some time at the startup (which later turned down an acquisition offer from pre-IPO Yahoo, doh!, and finally basically shut down), I returned to contracting, this time to Schwab. Then I did some freelance, and then returned to help\nthe same group at HP for a short-time. Then contracting at Bank of America. Then a short contract for a web dev shop, and then got into angel investing (Napster), and co-founding startups (social networking pioneer Ryze).<p>Now several startups later, I've returned to a combination of remote contracting and/or part-time co-founder (heard this term yesterday :). Some companies I've helped on a cash basis (hourly/weekly rate). In many cases, it is combination of cash plus equity. I'm just wrapping up a contract where I built out the server and dev-ops infrastructure and code for a new startup, as well as helping w/ analytics, product, etc. (and where I continue to be a senior adviser).<p>My experience has been that the on-site contracting market in the SF Bay Area is quite efficient and dynamic, and networking is not necessarily needed. Although I did a lot of networking in the early days, which has been great in opening up opportunities over the medium/long-term, the networking was not a factor in getting leads for on-site contracting. However, it led to some resume bullet points that may have been helpful in landing some of those contracts (e.g. landing the BofA contract was helped by my experience coding some of the first Java applet ads for Symantec back in the day that was a freelance project that came from networking).",1370192007

5809161,comment,5809012,5809012,19,0,andrewvc,,,"This is a fair point, but it brings to mind another point I didn't really understand till the last couple of years. Learning about how compilers work is just as important. Building a small lisp compiler was a life-changing experience for me in terms of going one level deeper, as much as understanding C was. For those who've never written lisp before, the reason I recommend a lisp compiler is that lisp compilers are the simplest to write, and the most expressive in terms of runtime strategy since lisp syntax mirrors a compiler's IR (intermediate representation). I think this is just as important in todays world because languages like Ruby and Javascript are both directly inspired by lisp. We also live in a world where Clojure is seeing a steady rise, for once a Lisp with large potential for significant commercial adoption.<p>I can highly recommend the book Lisp in Small Pieces, $93 on amazon, and worth every penny. Walking through the building blocks and design decisions of a language changes the way you code. Every language you look at winds up being internally translated into your own IR whether you've written a compiler or not. Understanding the inner workings of a compiler however adds depth.",1370191781

I took one look at K&R and was turned off by the insane amount of low-level work you had to do compared to Java or Python, even to write a simple character counter.<p>I came back to it. I was slow at first, I was confused, but I learned how to write in C. I learned how to control memory myself. I learned how to do my own text handling. I learned how to avoid buffer overflows and segfaults.<p>In many ways, it's like going from a Mercedes-Benz to a Miata.

I'm sure you'd have to save your own taxes, instead of withholding. If you've never done that before, I assure you, it's really hard!<p>The contract rates are higher because they are paying for the: fact that in a few months you have to find a new job, so you're being compensated in advance for that, fact that there won't be benefits, fact that you are going to do a lot more work than a regular employee..<p>So, what's the good thing about contracting: Freedom. At least in the US, a 1099 employee can't be told: when to work, where to work, what to use for tools, etc. In practice, they can still ask you to ""agree"" to these things up front, but compared the level of control a regular employee is encumbered by, it is much less. This is US specific, not sure what the UK law is.<p>You get variety. Some people like the experience of working with lots of people and companies.<p>Finally, I guess the advice piece: you'll only be able to live off contract work if you are absolutely fearless and totally independent. You'll have to interview/find clients a lot.

In hind sight, I shouldn't have taken it). I've been out of work for a total of 6 days in 6 years (took a week to get a contract after a 3 month holiday). I started my first contract within 6 days of landing in the country (nothing prearranged)<p>Freelancing is when you go from short term contract to short term contract, or you quote/bid for work. They can be 2-5 days a week, for maybe a month or less. For that I agree you need to pimp yourself like @jangosteve says, because you are moving so much. You are basically a 1 (wo)man consultancy.<p>I don't do this (except for my ""on the side"" mobile stuff). Too inconsistent.<p>But if you are a back-end dev (or front end, just to a slightly lesser degree) you can stay in the same place for _years_, or until you get bored of it. 3-6 months is a normal minimum, at least in the .net space which I'm in.<p>Unless you are useless. Then you're likely to get turfed out quickly.<p>Where I am at the moment, I've been there for 3 years (nearly). Last place I was there for 2 including some as a full timer. I've done moonlighting (apps, websites) at the same time. One of the guys I work with has been there for 8 years. I'm sure HMRC should have something to say about it, but no one is looking.<p>I'd normally want to move on after 2, just to keep fresh, but I do the same with FT jobs.<p>I'd be very hesitant about taking a FT position anymore. You can be fired with 1 months notice, and you get 4 weeks holiday, and maybe 75% of the wages _with tax removed before you get it_.<p>Contracting, I get no notice (this has only happened once when the customer literally ran out of money), but usually 28 days. I don't get paid if I'm sick, but I keep myself healthy and allow for 2 weeks sick and 6 weeks holiday a year. I have insurance to cover if I get REALLY sick.<p>I usually take closer to 8 weeks holiday a year.

The paperwork overhead with a system like freeagent is TRIVIAL if you have a half decent accountant (cough mine is great cough maslins.co.uk). Make sure you have a bit of a buffer in case you DO have issues getting work or a client pays late (if they pay late consistently, fire their arse)<p>So:\n1.

Most US computing organizations didn't care about controls at all and wanted fixed-size records. European computing organizations wanted a single newline.

As in, during the lifetime of the people being exploited or us. This is going to take generations to solve. And I feel like the solution is partially already beginning. As we shift more and more menial work to being accomplished through technology, fewer and fewer people will be needed for these jobs. Optimizations through software, robotics, and 3d printing will all but eliminate the need for humans in manufacturing and many other industries.<p>However, in our current state, we're seeing the repercussions of this type of shift in western countries: vast unemployment. To me this means we just have way too many people alive now. Clearly that isn't a quickly solvable problem (unless you are a genocidal maniac or something...), and so greatly reducing the birthing rates over coming generations (which hasn't really even been approached yet) is the only solution.<p>A much smaller global population, with largely technologically optimized labor, is the only solution that really would allow most of that population to live comfortable lives in relative luxury.<p>So you can see how I would view any argument about what needs to be done in the short term as moot, as in my mind it would just be a waste of effort",1370190857

Also, don't stop with youtube, offer some Vimeo integration -- alot of early adopters, and generally open-minded people (I'd like to think) post videos there, and even relatively serious ones.<p>To be honest, I think you should even open this up to a pure content distribution network. A lot of the time, people put up trailers for work they're doing on places like Vimeo/Youtube, and if you gave them a way to sell their final product (and collected VERY low fees), that would be amazing -- I don't know that there's anything like that now. But maybe that's more of a future move, if you choose to, focusing on people with successful youtube channels is a good start.<p>[EDIT] - Also, be very careful, because a service like youtube could instantly create an integrated competitor that would make it very hard for you to compete. There IS however, value in being multi-platform, that way, no single platform's integrated competitor could take you out of the picture.<p>I'm no seer, but in the future, I think \ncontent distributors will want to distribute content over as much networks as possible. As youtube is rolling out paid channels from distributors, I think the creators of that content (or any content for that matter) will look to even make more money (obviously) by being involved in more than one distribution platform. I don't work in the financial sector, but more platforms pretty much looks like more income for any content creator.<p>I say that to say this: the more platforms you support, the more attractive your product looks as a general solution to the problem -- ""I put my extra content in one place, and all my viewers can access it, no matter how they view my work""<p>[EDIT 2] - I just took a look at your site (dug through your submissions) -- in my honest opinion, you should build that site out. slap a bootstrap theme on it, and make a proper landing page out of that (though KEEP the super easy upload -- fast examples/usage is awesome, maybe just give people the option of making accounts after you give them the link, if they're going to be doing it often)<p>I see a ton of places this could go, but it all depends on what you want the service to look like -- I'm just spouting stuff out",1370190683

There are two:  one guy with a big rope attached to a safety harness he is wearing, the other guy holding the rope with one hand.

He caulks a few places, with his companion holding onto the rope with his one hand, right above the (unclipped) harness clip.  You can be sure that if the first guy slips, he's a goner, there's no way the second guy is going to catch 150 lbs with his one hand.<p>So yes, factory conditions on average are probably better than the video, but no, this is not an isolated incident.

Continual active cooling would be needed to prevent deterioration and damage to the core, explosives, and other components. The high rate of neutron emission means that predetonation is inevitable, even with a very efficient implosion system. However, even the relatively primitive Fat Man design would have produced a 0.5 kt or so yield with this material. With optimal implosion design yields in the range of at least several kilotons are possible. If fusion boosting is used, then the adverse effects properties of reactor grade plutonium can be completely overcome""<p>Yield restricted to a couple kilotons is generally considered a fizzle. It's big compared to chemical explosives but only about a tenth as big as Hiroshima.

If that client, however honest and well-intentioned, turns out to be financially insecure and fails two weeks after your first invoice goes in, you're probably just another unsecured creditor who may not get much if anything out of them, and you start the cycle again. Or you might have longer periods for your payment terms, particularly with the more lucrative larger clients. Or you might take a couple of months to find your first gig if you don't have much of a track record or network yet. Or...<p>If you don't have enough financial security to survive for a few months with no additional income, you should have no doubt that dropping a regular job to go freelance is a big risk. Of course sometimes risks pay off, and if you do land a well-paid gig quickly then once you've got an invoice or two under your belt you can probably build that missing safety net quickly too. But sometimes risks end in disaster, and if you've got kids to feed or a mortgage to pay or other important financial commitments then you'd be brave/foolish to make the jump without ensuring you have a plan B.",1370189356

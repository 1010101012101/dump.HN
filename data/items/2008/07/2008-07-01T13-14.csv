232920,comment,231236,231236,0,0,ericb,,,"What this leaves out is the elder years. I believe there is evidence that looking back on an achievements like raising a family lead to happier grey years. Additionally, having someone to care for you when your spouse is gone, and having family to be a part of seems pretty likely to increase happiness. I'd be willing to bet that having grandkids makes people happier. (all play, no work!)<p>None of this was covered in the study.",1214920482

232917,comment,232623,232852,0,0,wallflower,,,"> Can you point to any open source project that is actually collectively owned?<p>Collective ownership - maybe more like republican ownership - see the code_swarm videos - only a cluster of people commit.<p>Successful open source projects are led by very strong leaders: (Linux) Torvalds, (Ruby on Rails) DHH, (Gnome/Mono) De Icaza. Eclipse is questionable - it's more like run by a board of directors, with a large (mostly IBM) programmer workforce.<p>> But you don't need compulsory socialization to do that!<p>Agreed. We got past the teamwork learning curve and we pair when we have to get things done fast/fix a problem. We usually don't pair otherwise, unless you count long-running IM conversation threads as pairing.<p>> XP provokes a lot of one-sided emotional reactions from people, some in favor, most against.<p>As for emotional reaction, I still get a heebie-jeebie hokey feeling when someone says ""I'll drive"" [but only in reference to pair programming].<p>As an aside, pair programming does not work in a dom-sub relationship (especially when the sub is passive and doesn't want to code) - the dom will take over the coding.",1214920217

In straight C, errors are a real pain. They just are. In working code, the evils of exceptions don't come up, because you don't get exceptions for the most part. As a practical matter, they're just debugging tools, and not control handlers.",1214920085
232915,comment,232890,232890,0,0,mojuba,,,"<i>Exceptions are a super GOTO. Rather than allowing you to jump anywhere in the position of the procedure, they allow you to teleport up the call stack to any number of handlers.</i><p>Wrong. Exceptions, unlike GOTOs, can't jump straight into a loop or any construct that has a local state. In fact, exceptions never break local states, and that's their beauty.<p>The best proof that exceptions don't break anything is that you can always represent a throw/catch cycle with IF's, RETURN's, possibly also subroutines, but there will be no GOTOs. You will have equivalent functionality, except the code will be a bit bloated and less readable.",1214919810

232911,comment,232861,232861,0,0,bookhuddle,,,"I second the vesting strategy.  Make sure that whatever you set up aligns incentives with performance and the company's interests.  Since this person is still working at another full time job, determine what level of commitment you expect that person to make to your venture (i.e. 10 or 20 hrs/week until a specific date or a funding stage); determine when will he have to commit full time to the business.<p>Consider how much each of you has contributed in initial capital and sweat equity to this point, where in your company's development you guys are at (concept only, prototype, beta version, etc) and how what he'll contribute is worth to you guys.<p>Since there isn't a clear market to easily price your venture, it'll probably come down to an agreement that feels right to you and you can live with.<p>Definitely talk to your lawyer.",1214919684
232910,comment,232890,232890,0,0,kingkongrevenge,,,"Except for the point about exceptions being like GOTO, I fail to see how any of this differs from the complexities of procedurally handling return code errors.  Exceptions give you a better way to distinguish error handling from control flow.<p>I'm not even sure I understand how GOTO is unmitigated evil.  Occasionally it can be the clearest way to break out of a nested loop.  Doesn't the Evil GOTO song and dance come from an ancient era when it played a completely different role in languages?",1214919561

Where I work I see <i>a lot</i> of swallowed exception, which has lead to some evil bugs. I have also encountered some code that's literally impossible to write meaningful test code for because every exception is swallowed and there's no return code.<p>However, I don't think that going back to checking return codes solves anything. Most of the problems I see at work are related more to checked exceptions than using exceptions in general. Thankfully, most of java frameworks I use have moved towards making everything an unchecked exception.",1214918858

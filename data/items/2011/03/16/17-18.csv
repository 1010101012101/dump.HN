The laws of physics are not discovered by running experiments to enumerate every possible combination or permutation of configurations.""</i><p>Wanna bet?  Guess how we know most of what we know about criticality and neutron cross-sections?  People like Louis Slotkin, who spent hundreds of hours poking at piles of radioactive material in the lab, to derive those mathematical models that you're leaning upon.  Critical mass calculations, in particular, are so fiendishly complicated that the entire field of stochastic simulation (i.e. monte carlo methods) were invented to address them.  So tell me again about the ""laws of physics"", and how they're not tested through pemutation.<p><i>""The optimal shape for criticality is a sphere....a wide, shallow puddle at the bottom of the containment chamber is the least dangerous shape.""</i><p>Prove it.  It's pretty amazing how everyone wants to cite ""physics"" to prove that there's no problem with a meltdown (in the face of overwhelming empirical evidence to the contrary), but nobody is doing much more than hand-waving allusions toward their undergrad physics textbook in defense of their assertions.<p>A sphere is definitely a shape where we have good calculations to model critical mass.  Otherwise, we don't really know much that wasn't determined empirically.  We know that criticality depends strongly on density.   We've <i>assumed</i> that the structure of this reactor will prevent that density change from occurring.  We don't actually <i>know</i> what will happen.<p>I can almost understand why a community of nerds is so strongly interested in maintaining the self-delusion that the world is a fully knowable, controllable place, but I don't understand how so many people can ignore so much real-world evidence for so long.  If you're seriously telling yourself that a meltdown isn't a big deal, you need to go back and re-examine what you know about the situation, and why you think you know it.",1300297987

Sending information back in time is a paradox. Period</i><p>Not quite.  You're neglecting quantum mechanics.<p>Very roughly speaking, in quantum field theory, the probability of an event happening is a weighted sum over all the possible ways that it could happen (a path integral), and (again, speaking roughly) the options that seriously violate the various conservation laws tend to have negligible contributions.  Presumably the path integral formulation would still hold up even with closed timelike curves (time travel curves).<p>An inconsistent state, like one where you kill off your own parents, would probably exhibit all sorts of self interference that would make its contribution to the path integral very small, whereas the consistent states would be much better represented, and much more likely to happen.  Weird ""violations"" of physics could quite easily present themselves as the most probable outcomes, especially if the alternative was an inconsistent outcome.<p>A good way to think about this is in terms of waves on a string, or the ""wave"" of an electron in orbit around a nucleus - the only vibration frequencies that ""survive"" are the ones that reinforce themselves, and the rest get cancelled out by interference (in the electron case, because they don't ""match up"" when they meet themselves after an orbit).  If you think of the state of the universe as the electron, and the orbit as a loop through the closed timelike curve, then it's easy enough to imagine quantum mechanics doing all the hard work for us, and making sure that only consistent outcomes are reinforced, while all the other ones are destroyed by interference.",1300297699

This depth may be relative to mean sea-level or the average elevation of the seismic stations which provided arrival-time data for the earthquake location. The choice of reference depth is dependent on the method used to locate the earthquake. Sometimes when depth is poorly constrained by available seismic data, the location program will set the depth at a fixed value. For example, 33 km is often used as a default depth for earthquakes determined to be shallow, but whose depth is not satisfactorily determined by the data, whereas default depths of 5 or 10 km are often used in mid-continental areas and on mid-ocean ridges since earthquakes in these areas are usually shallower than 33 km.""",1300297363

Usually, when we look into these solutions in detail, we find that they require strange sorts of matter to sustain themselves, or that they're unstable.  Hawking proposed that the universe in some way bans any geometry that would allow these solutions.<p>The authors here claim that by adding a fifth dimension that's curled up like a circle, and adding a specific sort of curvature to it (the metric contains a periodic cross term between the usual time dimension and the curled dimension), you can get CTCs that are geodesics (i.e. paths that particles will take with no forces on them), and you don't get weird energy conditions or anything like that.<p>Then they go on about the potential consequences <i>if</i> the universe is actually curved up like this, and so on, but don't offer any particularly compelling reason to believe that it is.<p>So basically, they claim to have shown that it's possible for the universe to be like this, and that no condition we currently know of prohibits it.<p>Meh.  Could be, if we assume that they're right - it's always, of course, possible that there's some other problem with their solution that wouldn't be covered by the usual energy conditions, I'm not sure, I've been out of the GR circuit for a while so I don't know what people currently consider to be the most reasonable set of constraints that the Real World follows.  But even if they're right, there are plenty of solutions to Einstein's equations that <i>could</i> have happened and don't, so there's nothing too revolutionary here, and mentioning a whole lotta shit about branes and the Higgs boson doesn't change that.<p>This is still quite useful theoretical physics to do, mind you, but it's nowhere near as important as the article makes it out to be.",1300297119

2332949,comment,2327282,2329428,0,0,codex,,,"Forgive me, this post is intended to be facetious.<p>My personal view is that the societal desire for and against privacy and human rights always trumps any technological barriers.  Hitler and Stalin, for example, were able to do pretty bad things despite having relatively primitive technology.  Examples date back to the dawn of recorded history.  Even today, I can be tracked using my license plate number, fingerprints, DNA, etc. pretty handily.  Where there is a will, there is a way.  Fortunately, our society does not have the political will to do it--and, in fact, would likely find inappropriate tracking to be revolting.<p>In this respect I think Stallman is way off base.  Fighting to make sure your phone runs OSS does little to ensure that the culture we live in values the right things and has an ideal political structure (representative democracy).  I'd argue it's a dangerous distraction, in fact, because it promulgates the incorrect notion that if only we had open technology, we'd be free from criminals, dictators, and other bad things, and we'd live in a world of ponies and rainbows.  Because this is not true, I fear this effort diverts attention from where it deserves to be.  That said, RMS's scare tactics to help to some degree, by reminding people that our societal values will always need to be projected into the latest wave of technology.  I think this tends to happen naturally and organically, but whatever.<p>Fortunately, the flipside is pretty good: given the right political environment, privacy and technological regulation can coexist peacefully.  This is good because some amount of regulation of the commons is necessary and good, and this extends to new technologies (like the car, or the cell phone).",1300296589

The bill is due once a year, and imagining a company being without the cash for it stretches my imagination to the breaking point.<p>Third, ""being asked now for money they don't have yet"" is the entire reason the company is selling equity in the first place. They can surely budget for an extra 0.015 of an already proportionally tiny amount.<p>Fourth, they aren't taxed on valuations but on, to coin a term, their employees' <i>realized compensation</i>. This may be based on valuation, but justifiably so, since compensation is compensation.<p>Hell, a company with bottomless greed and a deep commitment to nickle & diming could probably find a way write the tax bill into their options contracts.<p>Fifth, the weird part of the law is that it is structured as a payroll tax rather than as an income, capital gains, or wealth tax.<p>Otherwise it appears to be a very honest attempt to fairly tax different forms of compensation in a non-regressive way.",1300296335

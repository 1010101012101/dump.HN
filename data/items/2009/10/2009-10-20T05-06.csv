891861,comment,891841,891841,0,0,kinghajj,,,"My computer science teacher has a saying, ""Mathematicians are always right."" Why is zero even? Well, because it's <i>defined</i> to be even. If you try to bring personal intuition into mathematics, you'll just repeatedly shoot yourself in the foot; there's no use arguing against it.<p>I had a similar problem with accepting that 1/inf = 0; to me, there could always be a smaller number, and therefore would never reach zero. Calculus made me realize I was wrong, and now I don't even bother trying to reason why mathematicians decided these things.<p>EDIT: Man, I knew as I wrote it that someone would get smart-ass with the sentence ""Well, because it's <i>defined</i> to be even,"" but I didn't expect so many. Yes, you're right, zero isn't defined to be even, but zero meets the definition of evenness. Happy?",1256018140

I think that computer users have become progressively <i>more</i> savvy over the years. I think users would certainly welcome an OS that was a small but notable improvement over the fairly good XP. The reason that Vista failed was it was noticeably <i>worse</i> than XP. Not a small improvement, not any improvement. Worse.<p>A notable disfunction among Vista's many disfunctions is the sensation that <i>you are not in charge of the computer</i>. The computer brings up all sort of things in an opaque fashion and this entirely annoying to anyone who expects to use the computer to accomplish a task since you don't know what roadblock will appear in your way.<p>There is a certain school of interface double speak which constantly bleats ""Of course an experienced user might be bother by feature X but this is actually comforting to an average user (who is a combination moron, chump and victim, it seems).""<p>Vista was one place where the majority of computer users gratifyingly refused be this ""average user"".

891843,comment,891353,891748,0,0,Shooter,,,"Sure. Several features didn't work as advertised, or only worked intermittently. They always fixed the issues eventually (and apologized), but we were losing customer calls and faxes in the meantime.  Sometimes the service didn't work at all...outages and transfer issues led me to their customer service, which sucked.  It was infuriating to be paying for advertisements that featured the 800#, only to have the incoming calls/faxes be lost or misdirected.  When you have offers for a home lost in the ether, you want decent customer service.  Unfortunately, their entire customer service staff seemed to be on their forum - monitoring and rapidly deleting any complaints or negative comments.  At one point, they banned one of my employees from their forum because she was trying to resolve an issue.  It drew too much attention to the problem.<p>I believe they've taken in additional funding since I used them (?), so they may have improved.  I've not had problems with any of the (dozens of) other 800# or virtual PBX providers I've ever used though, so I was left with a fairly bad opinion of RingCentral.",1256017228

""Totty, Michael"" <Michael.Totty@wsj.com>
To:
envitar<p>Sir,<p>Thanks for your note. Space limitations prevented me from mentioning Tesla, which indeed gets considerably more miles on a charge than a Volt. As I understand it, it does this by using some sophisticated electronic controls and a huge array of batteries, both of which help account for the Tesla roadster’s steep price tag. The point I should have made more clearly is that, when cost and weight are considered, lithium-ion batteries in production vehicles are going to continue have a much smaller range than comparable gasoline-powered vehicles. Not to suggest that makes them impractical – some 80% of all car trips are less than the Volt’s 40 mile range. But the grail remains something with even a higher power density than lithium ion.<p>You’re also correct about flywheels – they’re useful for a number of critical grid applications, mainly in maintaining power during brief outages. Most of the experts I talked with, though, didn’t include them as a solution for larger storage needs, or to handle storage for variable power sources like wind. Still, there’s a lot of interest in flywheels, and they probably merit a closer look in the reports.<p>I appreciate your writing.<p>Best regards,<p>Michael<p>Michael Totty<p>News editor/Journal Reports<p>The Wall Street Journal",1256014835

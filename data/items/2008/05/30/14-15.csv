However, your blog better be one of the top blogs in the world if you're to make a living off it, so what's the point. Also, it's clear from the comments here that many people (myself included) are turned off by partial feeds, so that will only decrease your chance of being successful.<p>However, if you're trying to build a name for yourself or your company, that is - you're the advertiser (of yourself, your skills, your thoughts), and the ads are the blog posts, then it doesn't really matter where and how people read them, and it makes the most sense to provide whole article feeds.",1212159508

I'm often the type of person who can be surrounded by a huge group of people and still feel incredibly alone.<p>Here is an excerpt from an essay I wrote after returning from a year abroad in China:<p>""The concept of 'foreignerism' is not unfamiliar to me.  Though I have spent the majority of my life as a citizen and resident of the United States of America, I am, in many ways, suspended between two worlds.  Long before I moved to China, I felt like a stranger in a strange land and I often yearned to find a place that I could truly feel at home.  Then shortly after I had adjusted to life in Beijing, I found myself completely at ease.  Looking back now, I have to wonder if I did actually find somewhere that I ""fit in"" or if rather, I finally became comfortable with the fact that I might never quite fit in anywhere.""<p>I can send you (or anybody else) the rest of the essay if you would like. Just email me at m[at]gee.ky.

I think some of the most interesting opportunities are in industries not directly related to software, where creative application of software can make a huge difference.  Octopart is a great example.<p>The reason there are many such opportunities is that very often software people focus their efforts on rehashing the same themes - software for developers, software for ""business"", social software, or software for its own sake.  And the reason behind this is that many developers aren't exposed to the other industries - mechanical, chemical, transportation, hospitality, farming, industrial fishing... the list can go on and on.<p>So, a long-winded way to get to my question:  Can you learn an industry without working in it, to the point where you can spot the gaps that can be filled with software?

It isn't exactly profitable to not care about utilization rate of bodies, but then a small web dev house has to pump out better stuff faster than the other guy (and there is always an ""other guy"").<p>I mean, if your product isn't selling, then you should probably find a new product, right?",1212156024

So people are much more compelled to make friends. After a couple years your circle of friends kind of crystallizes, and those whom you don't know aren't that eager to stretch out of their little circles either.<p>I went through the ""moving to a new place"" experience a few months ago when I moved to Germany for 3 months. It was really odd, as it was the first time in my life when I really had to objectively think about how to make new friends.<p>And the best advice I can give about that is: DON'T go live on your own. At least not for the first few months. Go live with other people, particularly with people who value having a good vibe in the house, and not just living together to share expenses but never looking each other in the face (if you're going to Germany, look for ""kein zweck WG"" ;). You'll end up becoming friends with them, and meeting their friends that come over from time to time.",1212156023

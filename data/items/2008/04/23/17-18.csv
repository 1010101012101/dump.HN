You seem to have at least one other project about which you're passionate, and which you would be pursuing all-out - you seem to be getting all hung up on the guilt involved in abandoning the first one.<p>I say this is a classic example of the ""sunk costs"" fallacy. You're holding onto something bad because you've already put effort into it, instead of doing what's best for you. I say drop it like it's hot, and throw yourself into the new project.<p>You're in a fortunate position, as students - rare is the startup that can afford to realise it's working on the wrong product, back up, and change direction.

Technology, nightlife, and dating seems pretty great in SF. And when you have no obligations, you can take advantage of all of that.<p>Most of the programmers I know are now in their 30s with small children.  We're trying to figure out how to pay a mortgate and preschool costs that easily exceed $1000/month.<p>Salaries are high here, and two income families can swing it.  But I have realized that high costs are toxic to freedom.  Yeah, if you score huge with a startup you'll have enough money be free of the daily grind, but that isn't really in the cards for most of us, even if we take a real crack at it.<p>I know people who have cashed out of the real estate market in SF and moved to Austin, and they absolutely love it.  I think I'd enjoy it there, too.  I think that it's probably easier to gain financial independence and start living on your own terms in other cities.  And these don't have to be crappy lame places - these are really entertaining places to live.  In some ways, I think the cost structure of SF makes it a less entertaining place to be, because people have to make more decisions based on paying the mortgage than doing something creative.<p>But my wife and I have a huge extended family in SF (parents, grandparents, cousins, nieces, nephews, etc...).  I've actually tried to leave, but just I can't do it.  And to me, cost is the only problem - if you have the dough, then for a certain type of person, SF may be the most pleasant place to live in the US.",1208971063

But you can't deny it's a case of something that on the surface seems downright worthless, yet people have done some really creative things with it... like the story written one twitter at a time, and the twitter poems, and the fact that it seems to be a new PR outlet. Anything that people use in ways not envisioned by the creators is bound to go somewhere... whether that place is 'mainstream profitable enterprise' is yet to be seen.",1208970743

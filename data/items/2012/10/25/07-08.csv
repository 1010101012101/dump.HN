Python's MI works in a clear and obvious way, similar[0] to how the Ruby inheritance chain is clear and obvious. MI really doesn't fit Ruby though, and IMHO would look too bolted on.<p>Most of the time the problem is people beating the platform they develop on into submission, instead of embracing it by getting a clear picture of what happens.<p>[0] As <i>_why</i> said[1], python and ruby are damn close: you can easily get something similar to Ruby's modules and inject them dynamically in the inheritance chain: <a href=""https://gist.github.com/3951273"" rel=""nofollow"">https://gist.github.com/3951273</a><p>[1] <a href=""https://github.com/whymirror/unholy"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/whymirror/unholy</a>",1351151883

In userspace, use libatomic-ops.  In kernel space, you've got atomic_t and it works well.<p>static_assert: the kernel has BUILD_BUG_ON.  You can easily roll your own in userspace in a line or two.  It should get added to C at some point, but it's not a huge issue.<p>type inference via ""auto"": C++ only needs this because it adopted the ""stutter"" syntax 30 years ago.  ""Foo foo = new Foo()"" is not something you see in C.<p>nullptr: C++ only needed this because it had function overloading.  Since NULL is actually just a macro for 0, it easily matches functions where it ""shouldn't"".  C doesn't need this hack.  Note that you still have the ""pointer to bool"" conversion path in C++-- have fun with that.  (C doesn't have bools.)<p>lambdas: gcc has supported nested functions in C for a while.  Not too many people use them because honestly, they are not that useful in C, as good as they may be in other languages.<p>regexp: there's a ton of libraries out there for doing regular expressions in C.  PCRE is a well-known one.  Or even just regex.h.  However, if you find yourself using this a lot, it might be a warning that you're using the wrong language for the job.<p>parametric polymorphism: now we're getting closer to the heart of the issue, aren't we?  A lot could be written about this, but let me just say this: the C++/Java type system leans heavily on inheritance, which is an antipattern.  C tends to encourage you to use composition, which is the right way to do things anyway.  You can create vtables of function pointers in C when you really need to, which isn't as often as a lot of Java/C++ programmers have been trained to think.",1351151401

Lately a trend I've come to notice is that more and more companies in their job adverts are asking for, if not insisting on, potential candidates having evidence of public, hacking side-projects.  They want github repos, they want active coding blogs, both of which imply that not only should you be spending 50-60 hours a week working for a flat salary, but you should also spend the remaining time doing nothing but thinking about, hacking in, and writing about software!  It's can't think of another field where, if you don't spend every waking minute practicing your profession, you're not worthy of consideration for employment.

We don't all want exactly the same things.<p>I think the big failure is programmers' inability to bring these desired advances, like what Plan 9 achieved, to a wider audience.  I mean, he says he had this wondwerful environment at Bell Labs, but almost no one outside of Bell Labs gets to experience that pleasure.  Why not?  They open sourced it too late?  I'm not sure I buy that.  It's still better than UNIX, so what's changed?  It's like there's some assumption that people just don't deserve anything better, and there's no point in working towards it.  Except if you're at Bell Labs.<p>We're stuck with old UNIX, with all of its historical cruft.  Like him, I've just learned to cope with it.  (It's funny he's complaining about argv limits (see 2004 Slashdot interview).  That seems to suggest he likes to compose super long argv's.  No?  Maybe he does not like xargs?  I never did.  But then I've seen similarly unexplainable limits in the Plan 9 port to UNIX. Why can't I have a Plan 9 sed command file with a very large number of commands?)<p>We could certainly have better.  Perhaps it's simply a matter of getting behind the right projects, instead of just following the money and being lazy... working at Google and buying MacBook Pros.  That's sort of like giving up.  Complacency.<p>Honestly, ""grep'ing the web"" just doesn't sound all that ""amazing"" to me.  I don't care how many servers they have running, Google is not Bell Labs.",1351150790

Google allowed the tablet OS to ship and run all it's phone apps really badly.  That set a terrible precedent and left people wallowing around in a sea of unoptimized apps (the oft repeated claim that Android has no tablet optimized apps is as much that people can't <i>find</i> them as that they don't exist). I think they would have been much better off drawing a line in the sand and promoting explicitly tablet optimized apps and relegating unoptimized ones to a clear secondary status.<p>By contrast, MS is saying, if you want prime real estate for your app in Win8 then it's going to be Metro and hence tablet optimized by default. As a result I am sure that every major software provider is going to ship metro versions of their apps, if only to get themselves onto that metro UI that every user is forced to see by default and into the store in a priority position.",1351149979

4696672,comment,4694227,4694764,1,0,throwawayhn25,,,"Canada is the second largest country on Earth and one of the most sparsely populated,[1] and Canada has already laid claim to a vast swath of the Arctic that it has neither the will nor the means to settle or defend.[2] For you to lust after a single square inch of another nation's soil is greed of a particularly galling and egregious quality.<p>Canada chose to remain a servile possession of a foreign monarch until 1931 (and in some respects, remains such even to the present day), and one of the consequences of that choice was having the UK manage your foreign affairs and your mother country's desire to maintain good relations with the US resulting in Canada getting the short end of the diplomatic stick.<p>Frankly, I am still bitter about the Oregon Territory boundary dispute[3] and even the very existence of British Columbia, a Canadian ""Polish Corridor"" separating Alaska from the rest of the continental United States. That Americans require passports to drive to and from Alaska--on a highway that was originally constructed by the US Army, no less--is utterly reprehensible. You're delusional if you think Alaskans would ever choose to (or could somehow be coerced to) join your country. Even if you took the queen off your money and out of your Constitution and amended your beloved Charter so it actually protected freedom of speech, private property rights, and other fundamental freedoms Alaskans hold sacred, they would balk at having share their oil wealth through transfer/equalization payments (which don't exist in the US) with the rest of Canada. If anything, it's far more likely that Alberta would secede and join the US, if only to avoid subsidizing the other provinces any longer, or that Quebec would become an independent nation.<p>You and other Canadian nationalists should aim towards trying to keep what you already have--which, in my opinion, is far too much as it is.<p>1: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Countries_by_population_density"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Countries_by_population_density</a><p>2: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canadian_arctic"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canadian_arctic</a><p>3: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oregon_boundary_dispute"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oregon_boundary_dispute</a>",1351149611

See the links in my previous post. In fact not only that it's easy, I haven't yet found any alternative environment where the operation is so powerful. A few days ago I used sam to extract all structs in the Go tree that use a map but not a mutex, or structs that use the first ones and don't have a mutex either. I only cared about a select/find operation, but I could have paired it with a modify operation that could have added the mutex, for example. The scope and power of the language is unmatched.<p>> name completion<p>Personally I think it's worthless (and so do most acme users I know) but it's easy to implement as an external program.

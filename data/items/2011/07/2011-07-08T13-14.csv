I can't even deduce what point is being made beyond <i>X</i> is greater than <i>Y</i>. You can't simply invalidate a problem, because you found a larger (scarier) number on Wikipedia. Have you considered the amount of time spent and km traveled in a car versus time spent in bars and social gathers? I hope not because it's a rabbit trail and a moot point.",1310133568
2742414,comment,2741770,2741770,4,0,mdasen,,,"So, the question I have is: how many of those bands/artists make it?<p>The article mentions an advance of $1M.  I think the $20 per CD rate claimed in this album (1M CDs sold is claimed to be $20M in sales) is a bit high (then again, I haven't bought a CD in a while).  Suffice it to say, I'd lower that to $10-12M gross and maybe $7-8.4M when costs are accounted for. Even with digital distribution, I think the iTMS/Amazon are taking 30% which would lower $12M gross to $8.4M after Apple takes its cut.  Correct me if I'm wrong, but from what I've heard/seen an album costs around $10-12 on iTunes and Apple takes 30% of that.  I can't imagine physical stores (who have the overhead of real-estate and employees) taking less.  I mean, 20% breakage fees are outrageous, but arguing that selling 1M albums equates to $20M gross is also outrageous since CDs don't cost $20 a piece.<p>So, how many of these bands succeed?  If I gave a $1M advance to ten bands, would nine of them sell a million albums or only one of them?  Thinking of it like an investment, that's an important question.  If only one of them sold a million albums (and the rest failed), it would mean that I've put out $10M while the CDs sold grossed $12M (and probably $8.5M after the selling store takes its cut, before any other costs).  In this case, there isn't a lot of money for the successful band to be well rewarded.  Even though they brought in 8x what was invested, there was only a 1 in 10 chance of them succeeding and a lot of that money is going to subsidizing the investment in the failed bands.  However, if 9 out of 10 sell a million records, around $75M is being brought in (after the selling store's cut) while $10M was invested and so there should be plenty of money for the bands/artists to be well-rewarded for their success.<p>I'm not saying that there aren't dirty tricks being used.  I simply don't know how often bands that get these advances do well.  If the risk is that most ventures are very unprofitable, it means that the ventures that do become profitable don't get well-rewarded because of the risk involved.<p>There's also the issue of the amount of money.  In this case, it's $1M.  That isn't a sum that most people can come up with and, as such, commands a premium.  A lot of the larger VC investment comes after a team has shown that it can get a bit of traction.  Places like YC invest early, but it's small amounts.<p>In the end, if you believe in yourself and think there is little risk, it's always best to invest in one's self.  However, it can be hard to stomach the risk if the costs are high and the industry failure rate is also high.  I'm sure that the record companies are making off with loads of money unfairly, but what's absent from the article is a sense of how many bands that get the advance make it and how many fail.  That's a critical piece of information that could turn their whole argument on its head.  And without that information, it's impossible to realistically evaluate fairness.  I'm no fan of record labels.  I think they're an antiquated system in an age where digital recording, editing, and distribution can allow people to create high-quality media.  However, if the article wants to convince me of its merits, it needs to offer some statistics about the success/failure rate of the bands/artists getting the advances.  If the success rate is 90%, they have a good point.  If the success rate is abysmal, it casts some doubt.  I'd say it casts more doubt on the system of offering advances (than offering a defense of record labels) and argues for a more efficient initial production, but that's the hacker ethic in me.",1310133567

5,878,499,562,554 / 365 days / 24 hours = 671,061,594 miles away.<p>Or I could stick a mirror in space 335,530,797 miles away (~ 540,000,000 km) from earth and stare at it.<p>Mars, at the widest distance from Earth, is 401,000,000 km away[2], which is close enough for my purposes (I'm not picky)... so I guess if I stuck a mirror on Mars and looked at the reflection of earth I could see something like 45 minutes in the past.<p>The Moon is almost exactly 1000x closer to the earth than Mars[3], so I wonder if I used it for my mirror array instead if I could just put a station with 500 mirrors on it to accomplish the same thing.<p>Or build something on earth with millions of mirrors in it to accomplish the same thing.<p>I would normally think something like this impossible, but I just watched a docu on the LHC and now I wonder if even at a micro-second scale, if we have tried building something like this and observed two points in space using a computer and seeing if the visual data coming in is micro-seconds apart from each other?<p>For example (assume I have a camera and visual-diff software sufficient for this and that my ""mirrors"" have sufficient magnification capabilities to make this seem like an easy setup), if I pointed one camera at a monitor drawing a unique pattern 2' away from me, then point another camera at a mirror that has bounced the image 10 miles before being displayed... I imagine, like sound, there would be a lag in that image if we bounced it enough times.<p>(DOH)<p>It suddenly dawns on me that using this method to look into the past is effectively the same thing as recording something with a video camera and playing it back later... you are literally capturing the light for review at a later date.<p>So as cool as this idea is, I think I just answered my own question as to why we haven't tried to build a million-mirror-array before... cause I can buy a video camera for $300 instead :)<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.universetoday.com/45047/how-far-does-light-travel-in-a-year/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.universetoday.com/45047/how-far-does-light-travel...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.universetoday.com/14824/distance-from-earth-to-mars/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.universetoday.com/14824/distance-from-earth-to-ma...</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://www.enotes.com/science-fact-finder/space/how-far-moon-from-earth"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.enotes.com/science-fact-finder/space/how-far-moon...</a>",1310133019

Richard does ""name names"" and directly voice an opinion of another person's abilities and a judgement of their actions.<p>One of the comments in this HN thread reads: ""Get off your high horse you fucking moron"". <i>That</i> is abusive. Never mind that this comment is in response to someone I happen to disagree with.<p>On the other hand I did not find the ""cutting off his fingers"" comment abusive.  It comes across an elaborate, possibly overwrought, way of saying ""This guy is making me angry"". It is OK in my book to give people feedback on how their actions are making you feel. The imagery is violent, the tone is not.<p>What I <i>do</i> find abusive is the phrase ""people like you"" which Richard uses in the same comment. So my considered opinion of these comments would be yes, they are somewhat abusive. But I would stop well short of ""bullying"".<p>Richard's attacks have a clear object-level target, which is <i>not</i> a person: he is clearly making legitimate (not necessarily true, but legitimate) claims about the TB development process - that it breaks features that worked, that the concerns of some users are being summarily dismissed, and that there is a pattern of these things happening over and over again.<p>Yes, the tone he uses for saying those things sometimes crosses a line. But on balance, the impression I'm taking away from this dispute is that Richard is being banned not so much for his tone, but more for saying things that are true and that the people wielding the power to censor him are unwilling to hear.<p><i>That</i> aspect of the whole mess, the way the power asymmetry plays out, is what I suspect has people coming out in Richard's defense. People with ban buttons should usually err on the side of tolerance.<p>The success of open source rests on participation, and participation is a two-way street. When you open a bug reporting system, the intended message is ""we care about your concerns"". Marking a bug as ""won't fix"" sends the exact opposite message. That makes it, too, a power not to be used lightly: someone wielding that power indiscriminately can easily turn into what I'd not hesitate to call a ""bully"".<p>At some point these tensions stopped being about mere civility, and started being about the power politics of open source. At least, that's how it looks to this outside observer.",1310131003

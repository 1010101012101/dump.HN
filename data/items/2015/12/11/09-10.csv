Everyone already had chip+pin terminals, and at first it was mostly coffee shops in London, but now many merchants have upgraded to contactless ones. It&#x27;s not just national chains, but local shops too. It&#x27;s much faster paying by contactless in a busy pub than paying cash.<p>It&#x27;s possible there&#x27;s pressure/support from Visa and MasterCard for small, local retailers to accept contactless payments. It&#x27;s part of their advertising that you can buy a newspaper using the system, and most newsagents are local, independent shops.<p>A basic chip+pin (not contactless) terminal is available for £100 (or £3/month), I can&#x27;t find a price for a contactless one.",1449827838

It is very easy to get a working game environment, of most of the most common forms, in 20 or 30 lines of code in MOAI, i.e. Pong, jump&#x27;n&#x27;run, shooter, etc.<p>On top of that, there are already 3rd-party frameworks which implement some sets of standardized &quot;GUI&quot; basics like sliders and buttons and scrolling scenes, and so on.  So its possible to do a common GUI that runs exactly the same on all platforms - i.e. ignore native entirely and boldly forge ones own ecosystem of standards.<p>Which is actually kind of nice, to be honest.<p>So I&#x27;m wondering about the C4 side of things and your plans to embrace/wrap/extend the GUI world.  Will you be a subscriber to the native world - and thus either have to do a lot of native host code (or find some way to make your developer-users responsible for the problem) - or do you think there is a future in non-native/runs-everywhere GUI development beyond that provided &#x27;by the majors&#x27;?<p>I&#x27;m going to put C4 on the lab-bench some time in the next few days, looking forward to checking it out ..",1449827532
10716209,comment,10711737,10712189,0,0,joshsharp,,,"I think it&#x27;s really interesting to see the divide between visualisations and &quot;actionable insights&quot; in the discussion here. I&#x27;m definitely more about the latter, which has been my focus when building Exist[1] — which you could say is an uglier AprilZero/Gyroscope. AprilZero looks like a magical movie interface (and I feel like Anand has said he was inspired by this sort of thing before). In contrast it&#x27;s definitely obvious I&#x27;m not a designer! So while Exist aggregates a lot of the same sort of services, it&#x27;s much more about trying to make it work for you — we track rolling averages for all your data points, find simple insights each day (best/worst steps for x days) and automatically correlate everything against everything else to find interesting relations. Correlation != causation, of course, but seeing things like &quot;Your weight is higher after you check into Little Greek Souvlaki&quot; (a genuine result of mine) feels sort of like magic to me, even though with some thought I probably could&#x27;ve figured that out on my own.<p>Where we still have a way to go is tracking things at a smaller than day-level granularity — I really want to find relations between things that happen around the same time, like checking in to a specific place vs productivity levels, but that level of smarts is still a fair way off I think. Plus the &quot;actionable&quot; part of &quot;actionable insights&quot; is a whole can of worms in terms of computers telling people what to do.<p>All the same, exciting times.<p>[1] <a href=""https://exist.io"" rel=""nofollow"">https://exist.io</a>",1449827503

10716151,comment,10715161,10715970,0,0,pron,,,"> Please notice how far afield you went to find a failure of inductive reasoning<p>Philosophy doesn&#x27;t &quot;find a <i>failure</i>&quot; of inductive reasoning because it doesn&#x27;t care (in this context) about how well things work. It questions whether induction creates <i>knowledge</i>[1] (vs. &quot;mere&quot; utility). You&#x27;re arguing about plumbing with a banker. If all you care about is plumbing, the bank is indeed a bad place to discuss it. It sounds as if you simply have no interest in looking at the world from a perspective other than utility, and the that you take the value of utility as an axiom. Philosophy is simply an exploration of views of reality with axioms different from yours. It is like the study of logics, while you like sticking to a particular logic system, building on top of that one. What you consider to be the end of the chain of questions that interest you, philosophy considers the beginning. That&#x27;s perfectly fine and maybe philosophy isn&#x27;t for you, but you&#x27;ve got no quarrel with it, and so far stated no disagreement with it.<p>[1]: <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epistemology"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epistemology</a>",1449826168

If you write all your own code this way, at least it will be easy to see which interfaces your own types implement, and (with a grep or GoRef) vice versa.<p>Plus you get interface implementation checking, so your error messages actually make sense if the interface or type method signatures unexpectedly change.<p>Again, this is not a real solution to your problem, but it has enough advantages to be worth mentioning.",1449824434

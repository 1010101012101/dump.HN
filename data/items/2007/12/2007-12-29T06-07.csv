93429,comment,93334,93334,0,0,cduan,,,"While I see the value in optimizing a language for these ""language-enhancements"" such as adding new iterators, I would be concerned about a language architect who sacrificed efficiency in other areas as a result. I'd much rather have blazing-fast each() alone over medium-speed each(), map(), fold(), unfold(), collect(), etc.<p>(Sidenote: isn't it a little unfair to compare the collect() implementation, which uses a for-loop, with a recursive unfold() method? Though I don't doubt that the iterative unfold() version would still be relatively slow.)",1198911132

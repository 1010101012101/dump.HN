Assuming I've captured the essence of the problem correctly, you would see a sharp drop in performance when you start to saturate about 20-30 dynos.<p>Given that there's an entire Wikipedia article on the sole basis that the behavior of these mathematical functions are nonintuitive, I think it is pretty fair to give RapGenius a pass at being surprised by the math as well.<p>[0] <a href=""http://rapgenius.com/James-somers-herokus-ugly-secret-lyrics"" rel=""nofollow"">http://rapgenius.com/James-somers-herokus-ugly-secret-lyrics</a>

They add composability which I think has wider implications than many realize at first.<p>Consider that with things like jQuery deferreds I can start a request in one function and pass it around adding handlers in others...something very hard to do with the old CB model. Maybe later on you have some optional action that you only want to occur if a previous action had completed. This sort of thing is easy with deferreds. It makes bundling together disparate actions easier as well as handling series of things as you mention.<p>Having an abstraction layer in there also has a lot of potential that is (somewhat) untapped. There is a lot of possibility for library authors to add excellent error handling or debugging capabilities in there - things that are currently a bit painful with POC (plain 'ol callbacks).<p>I agree generators have strong possibilities in this area- I would note thought that they are not an alternative to promises - the two are orthogonal, and in fact they work quite well together.

Home is the place I associate with relaxation, so it's kind of cruel to expect myself to get work done there. The general public in the library holds me accountable to make it look like I have a purpose to be there.<p>- There are places I'd rather be than the library, like home. This motivates me to get my work done as quickly as possible and move on to other things that are important to me.<p>- We are social creatures, and interacting with others is important to our well-being.

Her analysis of this ""problem"" must apply to women in business, and it's a little presumptive to assume that ""women in business"" means white, wealthy, and ""afraid to ask for more money."" How can she assume to speak for a group without consulting its members? The author of the article says sarcastically that Sandberg should just write a book that includes and pleases everyone including the black working class women. The book, she states, is applicable to women at the top of the workforce and that's useful. In my opinion, that's overly simplistic. The issues that Sandberg is trying to address are not simple, and can't be addressed via the ""women at the top"" without actually distorting the entire analysis. It's like running a study with 18 different confounding variables and ignoring them for simplicity's sake. If you're attempting to make any type of statement or analysis, why don't you allow your analysis to approach the complexity of the real problem?<p>Additionally, the ""problem that has no name,"" in Betty Friedan's historical coinage, means a problem that is inside women. Sandberg apparently implies that these factors; the social, political, and psychological, can be isolated and analyzed as disparate elements. It's ridiculous to assume that societal barriers play a role that's different from the psychological or even political: the entire point is that these forces are subtle and interrelated-- like a birdcage.<p>And to close, Sandberg wants to make women more ambitious, more ""out of the home"" and into the office, less likely to stay at home and ""leave before you leave"" oriented. She's essentially saying ""I want women to be as ambitious and work oriented as their male counterparts so they can see the same benefit."" My argument is that she's essentially using a ""white male"" yardstick to measure female values and achievement, and that in and of itself is oppression. Why the ""manstandard"" of obsession and aggression? Why not throw out that system and create one anew? Because Sheryl, let's be frank here: even if men are in fact asking for more money, and you get some women to do it too, is anyone going to be ""happier?"" Does the extra money really make life 100x more worthwhile? No. Striving for the equal paycheck is a dumb thing to strive for, it's not worth it.

Sometimes they choose research, sometimes they choose game playing, sometimes they choose reading Hacker News :-) but there is generally enough time for folks to do what they want to do.<p>Research is especially easy if you know what you want to research. But it's not a simple matter of ""Hey I'm in research, lets blue sky something!"" People in research have some passion that they are following, like parsers, or graph theory, or AI, or network coherence, or something. Some area where they have lots of questions and no answers.<p>Keep a notebook. One for each topic if you want, they can be the cheap composition ones that go on sale during 'back to school week' or really nice lab notebooks. But they are like pitons and rope to a climber, they anchor where you have been and where you are going. Write the questions you investigating into the first few pages after the index. Start writing down what you know, what you can prove, and what you don't know. Invent experiments or ways to discover the answers to the questions you don't know.<p>I've got a notebook with a couple hundred pages devoted to making carbon nanotubes. I know lots of ways you can't make them and several ways you can. Sometimes you can scrounge equipment for stuff, sometimes you have to invent (did you know that you could use a bottle of propane and a chunk of copper pipe as a way to do vapor deposition of carbon? You can! And if that copper tube rolls off the stand onto your wooden deck when its hot it leaves a big black mark? :-)<p>""Research"" doesn't need a government funded lab, it needs good laboratory technique. Careful note taking, documentation, exposition and analysis. Software research is even easier these days because of how cheap computers have become.<p>In general, having a job doesn't prevent you from asking questions or doing experiments (aka ""research"") but if you're tired after working all day and just don't want to think any more, that is a different problem. Some folks I know get under demanding jobs just so they can do it easily without straining too hard during the 'day.'<p>One of the things I did as a kid that drove my Mom nuts was read every scientist biography I could, I tried to re-create their experiments because anything an adult could build in the 1800's I figured I could build as a kid in the 1900's. But what it really taught me was how these people pursued the questions they had.<p>Bottom line, ""money and free time"" isn't an excuse, its a rationalization.

The professor of one of the largest undergrad classes discussed with us how it is very, very clear that the students' #1 priorities at Harvard are _not_ academics, but rather their extracurriculars. Despite this, they will still curve the class up so that a very large percentage of students get A's (I don't have a number here, but I was told that in his class, the median grade on an exam is curved to a B+, and that is very harsh by Harvard's standards).  At the very least, I think that this small tidbit falls inline with ""The Fall of Academics at Harvard"".<p>Personally, I think one thing that has to change is this perception that many overachieving highschoolers bring with them as they become undergradautes at these universities: that is, that college is a stepping stone to a prestigious, well-paying job. Furthermore, these historically high-achieving students aren't going easily let go of their stellar grade track record. Together, I think it's then easy to miss part of the point of the undergraduate experience all together, and there's an incentive to cheat.<p>Lastly, I wanted to include that I think this is also largely a cultural issue. I agree with others in this thread that there is this mentality of just feeding into these ""prestigious"" jobs (Finance, Consulting, etc.), and I think that greatly contributes towards the degradation of the school's ability to foster an academic environment.",1362287233

And does it last until you die?<p>As the blog post mentions, many countries have been issuing ID numbers to every citizen for decades. So it would be extremely simple to give each citizen a unique domain of the format id_number.ccTLD or similar. But why don't we do it? Because security and privacy.<p>For example, South Korea issues unique 13-digit IDs to citizens and long-time residents. For decades, these ID numbers have been <i>the</i> preferred way to identify people in every public and private setting. They are assigned at birth, unchangeable during a lifetime, and never reused after death, so it's easy to see why they would be ideal for unique identification. But recently, a law was passed that banned most online services from using these ID numbers to identify members, because there have been a number of high-profile breaches where tens of millions of ID numbers were leaked. But it's too late! South Korean ID numbers are a dime a dozen in every black market around the world, and it is estimated that every citizen who has ever signed up for an online service has had their ID number leaked multiple times already. A group of affected individuals recently petitioned to have their ID numbers changed, but were refused. (The SK government only allows your ID to be changed if there is reason to believe that NK is trying to kill you.) The case is currently at the Constitutional Court awaiting a final decision.<p>> <i>We Have to Many IDs ... Nowadays we commonly have a driving licence, passport, tax related number, electoral roll number, a personal domain, email, phone numbers and probably others depending on the country you live in.</i><p>The difference between your national ID number (if your country has one) and your passport number is that the former is a serial number for yourself, whereas the latter is a serial number for the passport. When your passport expires and you get a new one, your new passport has a new serial number, because it's a different physical object. If your passport is stolen, they only blacklist the passport, not your ID number. Since there is a one-to-many relationship between people and passports, it makes sense to store them in two different tables with different primary keys.<p>Your phone number can be easily changed, and this is a good thing because thousands of people are stalked by abusive ex-partners every year. If your phone number were irrevocably tied to your person, it would be a lot more difficult to prevent your ex-husband from finding you. Ditto for e-mail and physical addresses.<p>Even your name is not an immutable identifier. If you used to be john.smith.ccTLD but now you're mary.jones.ccTLD because you changed your sex and your parents disowned you, now you have to notify everyone about the change. In addition, many cultures have complicated rules about changing your name when you get married, and it's not always as straightforward as ""wife assumes husband's last name"". Sometimes you're given a ghetto name that sounds like ""dumbass"" in your second language and you need to change it before you enter a respectable profession. etc. etc.<p>For this and similar reasons, I am <i>prima facie</i> unenthusiastic about any identification code that lasts a lifetime. Unless the code is never meant to be disclosed to third parties, like a GPG private key. But even GPG keys can be revoked at will, and this is a considered a critical security measure.<p>> <i>Putting everything online could quite possibly lead to the greatest security breach of all time.</i><p>That disclaimer was supposed to be at the TOP of your blog post, not at the bottom. When we're talking about identification methods that last a lifetime and are difficult to change, security should come first and foremost.",1362287165

Even if they seem useless. Even if no one else is doing them. Even if people think it's stupid. Even if it doesn't make you money. Because there's something else that's motivating you to explore.<p>You don't have to be smart to try new weird things, but smart people tend to not worry about what other people think and go ahead and try new things.<p>Perhaps your quibble is the order of the statement.

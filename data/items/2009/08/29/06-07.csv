And anyway, I live by a stop sign, and I have never seen a car come to a full stop either.<p>Just out of curiosity, have you ever ridden a bike?  You get a sense of what rules you can and can't ignore.  A stop sign when you are on the non-conflicting side of a T intersection?  Probably safe to slow for, rather than stop, unclip, wait, and clip back in.  A red light at a major intersection?  Might as well wait.<p>Anyway, I am pretty conservative in breaking the rules, but I don't feel at all bad ignoring a stop sign when there is literally no traffic.",1251528781

OTOH, some orientals, specially arabs and chinese will probably bankrupt themselves hosting lavish dinners for others; while not a good idea, it at least buys them some social capital. Whoever takes care of the others is taken care of by all. While to Westerners, if you're out of money you have no recourse but the bank.",1251528659

I don't think I've ever ridden on the north side of the Lakefront Trail without experiencing at least one moment of sheer terror.  A nice ride, but I had to give it up.  People talking on their cell phones, riding on the wrong side of the road, little kids playing on the path, joggers that jump right in front of you (got a new wheelset out of that), sand all over the road surface around blind curves... (and yes, I went down hard because of this).  When it's raining, though, it's a great ride.  A drop of rain and the entire city goes inside, leaving the entire trail for me :)<p>The south side is much better (but a very boring ride), and I have never really felt unsafe on the road.<p>Anyway, I am just waiting for someone to get really hurt... it is bound to happen some day.",1251528522

792886,comment,792598,792835,0,0,c-m,,,"The adult generations have complained of the lack of virtue in their 1-2 successor generations probably for the past few millennia (in European history, going back at least to ancient Greek/Roman times) - enough written evidence has survived the times. What is qualitatively different from the ""usual"" stereotypes with this complaint here is the alleged deficits in face-to-face communication. But I agree with the caveat of lacking evidence.<p>OTOH, among (supposed?) adults, with the widespread use of email and ""digital media"" I have been observing an apparent decline in the quality of written work and correspondence (and I'm not (just) talking about rudeness and lack of etiquette in email), and also a lack of attention to refinement in oral communication, at least in business. But maybe this is just an instance of the stereotyped perception of a general decline in standards of excellence (and aspiration).",1251528422

Just to say it went from 30,000 employees to 1000 in a 7 year span is not the whole picture. Let me provide some perspective.<p>If you look at ALU stock mid 2000, it had at a high of over $80. It currently is at 3.80ish with a huge come back from a low of $1.09.<p>Alcatel and Lucent merged in Dec. of 2006.<p>In 2007, it lost 3.5 billion on about 18B of sales. In 2008 it lost 5B in 2008 on about 17B of sales. It has had about 4B in cash (&equivalents) and is providing itself with runway to get back into the black with asset sales.<p>Since the merger, there have been multiple lay off initiatives to try and stop the bleeding. (Not pansy 5-10% cuts, we're talking about deeper broader strokes)<p>Recently, it has begun to do better but is still rolling deep with legacy products and losses.<p>ALU is fighting for it's life. Facing these conditions, most companies would have severely cut a 'no short term profit' R&D division.<p>The cherry to top off this Article is that ALU is a French company with Lucent and Bell as its American subsidiaries.<p>Edit: Grammar and full disclosure: I am an ALU employee.",1251527455

I had refused to pay an extra $55 for features that should have been there in the first place, but now I have to. Furthermore, the UPDATE ISN'T DOWNLOADABLE (they mail it to you, for $10 to $90 extra, based on how fast you want it).

Unfortunately, a garbage collection cycle forces me to focus on garbage collecting (since I will usually have several <i>important</i> sites open among the trash), breaking my concentration on the research. It ends up being more productive to leave them open for a while, until they reach some threshold where I have to do too much work to find the important open sites among the garbage. That point for me is definitely more than 25 but also less than 100. I assume that it's different for different people.",1251526616

If the kid had the motivation to begin with, the book would be quite enough. (I had the motivation simply because I wanted to show up my elder sister; so the class was a waste for me.)<p>Which directly leads to one of the questions I posed: how could this startup force the target kids to learn, if it's remote? Without a good answer to that, I don't think it's a good idea.<p>(And on a tangent: school can be a good idea, even for motivated students, simply because some things are very difficult to teach yourself out of a book.

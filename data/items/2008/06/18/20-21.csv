But you will anyway, and you will get it wrong, and you will forever be wondering why your MySQL database doesn't scale properly.  Or why adding a bunch of RAM to the box didn't work the way you expected.  Or you'll write dumb ""optimized"" code with local copies of things that could be computed, and fail to understand the benchmarks showing why it doesn't work.<p>As a programmer, you are a user of a tool.  If you want to be an effective user of that tool, you need to have some understanding of how it works.  No, you don't need to be a fully trained ASIC design architect, or semiconductor process engineer, or solid state physicist.  But yes: you should understand how a circuit works, and what the parts of your computer are, and how they interact.<p>And your statement that ""specialists"" can get by without knowing ""a little about a lot"" just confuses me.  Every talented ""specialist"" I've ever known has an encyclopedic knowlege of all sorts of things outside their specialty.

This is a misconception that is easy to exploit in a population that thinks of graduate school as something like undergraduate, law, business, or medical school.<p>Graduate students in engineering are generally <i>producers</i> of wealth for universities.  For example, I recently left a job where I was paid over 100K a year (in addition to benefits and stock) to write code that built mathematical optimization models based on data stored in large RDBMSs.  Now, I don't actually think the pay was especially great considering the skill set (and I got a hefty raise when I left), but I know foreign grad students who were doing essentially the same thing for a research stipend that probably amounted to less than 20K/year, no benefits, stock, nothing (other than the possibility of a PhD after many years of servitude).  If these folks had the right to leave the university without screwing up their visas, they'd probably be making six figures in private industry like me (I left once I got my MS).<p>Sure, yeah, I suppose we should try to keep these folks here when they graduate, but the notion that the US has somehow put itself out to provide a grad education for foreign engineering students is baloney.

89870,comment,89055,89238,0,0,hhm,,,"Actually, I was just trying to be precise. I think market != needs and I was giving some examples... in the best of the cases, all needs are potential markets, but you haven't markets for all needs. And, what is more important and what was my original comment: not all needs generate interesting markets for you (because of tech possibilities, as you said, because of costs, because of logistics, etc).<p>I can think of all kind of needs: a google maps with 2d shading would make it fun for kids (to say something stupid). But they wouldn't pay for it, it would be very expensive to do unless you are google, and it would probably be expensive _even_ if you are google (because the raw data are photos and no 3d info excepting some selected places), etc etc etc. That's not an interesting need if you look from the market perspective... but if you fall in the trap ""anything useful for anybody is worth doing"" you might fall in the trap of creating that kind of worthless project.",1197731720

I had a high school math teacher who gave tests with more questions then anyone could ever answer.  The top score for the class on a 100 point test would often be around 8 and the average around 4. Everyone in the class learned how to deal with situations where you couldn't possibly answer all the questions perfectly.  The high scorers were often people who provided partial solutions to many questions instead of perfect ones to a few.",1197731614

Friend of mine suggested I start a ""secret"" blog on blogspot. I wrote 3-4 super long posts rambling and clearing my head.

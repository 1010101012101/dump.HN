A college education will be cheaper than it is now, and will be available entirely online.  Brick and mortar schools will be so desperate for students that they'll be offering zero-interest loans to get him to come back.<p>Conversely, due to family commitments and other aspects of real life, starting your own business is something that gets monotonically harder every minute until you retire.<p>Do it now, or it probably won't happen.  Believe me, <i>college</i> is what will wait.<p>(Edit: Maybe I was too hasty in saying 'bad advice.'  It's good advice if he actually takes it.

Doubtful, if they did (by a technicality say) then they could sue their clients but they couldn't (<i>a priori</i>) sue MS as MS are acting in good faith in their relationship with the same clients (people using MSIE allowing data tracking). The onus would appear to be on the Google users not to have tracking enabled (if indeed Google's ToS disallow such things).<p>Why not just grep Bing logs ... well clearly they can tell a lot about the relevance to a particular term by seeing how long a user spends on a page after searching for that term and following a link. If the user bounces then it's not likely to be high quality. This sort of info won't be easily gathered from Bing logs if indeed it is possible to get at at all.",1296604523

First, someone could look at it and spend a lot of time trying to figure out what it was doing before realizing what it did. Second, it could cause people to attempt to replace it without realizing the value of it, causing wasted effort. Third, it could cause people to try to improve it, spending time attempting to find a more optimal first guess, or adjusting the bit twiddling nature in some way. Fourth, and worst of all, it could develop a reputation as a bit of ""deep magic"" which shouldn't be touched because nobody knows exactly how it works, so nobody ever re-evaluates whether it's worth keeping. As it stands now it's obsolete code given that modern GPUs will perform the relevant calculation in hardware much faster.<p>Granted, in this specific case a lot of these problems are much diminished (since the company was small, the code and its rationale was well-known by the dev lead, and it's reasonably straightforward to reverse engineer the operation and rationale for the code with some investigation), however this might not be the case somewhere else with some other piece of comparatively magical code.<p>When you write a bit of WTF code that's actually worthwhile imagine that everyone that worked on the code is now dead and researchers are studying it, what information would those researchers want the most?

The site allows people to download music for free in return for sharing it with their friends on Fracebook. The website integrates pretty deeply with Facebook, and since I recently read that about 70% of Facebook's traffic comes from outside of the US (can't find the link), it makes sense that I would be seeing a lot of international traffic. I didn't consider this when I was developing the site so I have a few questions:<p>1. What collation should I have my database set at so that I don't see funky characters when users upload songs with à/ã/ë and other special characters in them? It's currently set to utf8_general_ci.<p>2. What do you think I should do about all of this international music being uploaded? I assumed that there would mostly be american music being uploaded, but I've seen a ton of international music uploaded each day. should I create an international section and/or genre for when the musicians upload music?

In some cases the profit was more than the $9.99 Amazon was charging so Amazon had to pony up $1 or $2 on each sale.<p>I think more recently Amazon has allowed publishers to use an alternative agency model that lets the publishers set their own prices and Amazon takes a fixed percentage cut of the sale. This doesn't cause Amazon to lose money, but now publishers can sell eBooks at nearly the same price as paper books which hurts the Kindle's attractiveness and slows adoption.<p>Regardless, this is an unworkable situation Apple has constructed. Amazon barely makes 30% of the sale price of each book if it even makes that much at all. It can hardly afford to give away its entire fee and then some to Apple.<p>This is either a strong arm attempt to get Amazon to agree to a strategic agreement for a fraction of the revenue or Apple is simply trying to destroy the Amazon Kindle app entirely. Either way Apple wins and Amazon loses. I suppose consumers can come out ahead if the strategic agreement allows in app purchasing of Kindle books for the same price, but it could also be bad if the iOS Kindle app disappears.",1296603455

That article you linked describes how it was arrived at:<p>1. Match monochromatic (narrow wavelength band) light sources of each wavelength with three particular monochromatic lights (called “R”, “G”, “B”), in some cases needing to add some of one of those three to the monochromatic source in order to get the two sides to match – this is a “negative” component. This process results in three (r(λ), g(λ), b(λ)) functions of wavelength.<p>2. Take three linear combinations of those three functions and call them (x(λ), y(λ), z(λ)), such that (a) the y(λ) function is approximately the same as the photopic luminance function as best it could be computed at the time, (b) all three of x, y, and z had only positive values, and (c) integrating each of the three yields the same value, so that an equal-energy stimulus will have the same X, Y, and Z values.<p>The red receptors in the human eye do not really have this kind of spike in response in the lower end of the spectrum.<p>* * *<p>However, “red” the “psychological primary” or “unique hue” does have some violet/blue in it.

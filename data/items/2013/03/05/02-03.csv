5322586,comment,5321603,5321603,4,0,danem,,,"I'm confused as to why people seem to think that only designs featuring large blocks of color and strong accents qualify as ""flat UI"". What is this 'style' a reaction to? Gradients? Drop shadows? What for? Does anyone really think that employing this aesthetic will free them from some perceived constraints imposed by current fashion? Does anyone think that the elimination of drop shadows will free the user to think about computing in more abstract, powerful terms?<p>Look around the web, and it is apparent that ""flat ui"" is already the standard. Indeed, I find it difficult to find many popular sites that makes heavy use of drop shadows and gradients to simulate light. Why is this single aesthetic now being heralded as the way forward while computing has been predominantly ""flat"" for most of its history?<p>I think people tend to forget that exercises in style ( such as this ) don't necessarily equate to design. The choices made in any given design must consider content and audience. Anything else becomes decoration, not design.",1362452340

There is something inherently enjoyable about clicking a button with a bit of depth, even if that depth is subtle. The flat UI perspective often removes that emotional touch. Several prominent designers (@kerem and @craigmod, to name two) have emoted that adding a bit of depth to a button makes clicking it more satisfying. We are in the design business, but that involves making things more than pretty and trendy. Flat design does look beautiful, but there is a growing consensus that in many cases it also removes a bit of soul and energy from a design.",1362452335

Thus the kilogram miles per Calorie -- the efficiency -- for an SUV is 1.33.<p>A peanut butter sandwich is 600 Calories (with bananas and maple syrup on whole wheat, but corn syrup on Wonder bread is similar).  A bicycle plus messenger bag and rider weighs 80kg and gets 10 miles to the peanut butter sandwich. Thus the efficiency of the bicycle is 1.33 kg.mi/C.<p>So far the bicycle and SUV seem exactly equal in efficiency and have equal environmental impact.<p>But that doesn't take into account cost. The peanut butter sandwich costs $5, or $3 if you make it at home. Call it $4. The gallon of gasoline also costs $4. But the gasoline has 50x the energy. The total cost to society is 50x higher to operate the bicycle, taking all process costs into account through the price system.<p>So in fact, biking is terrible for the environment.

Frankly, I think it's good to pair full-time while you (you, personally or your team) are learning it, but not beyond that. The OP tried pairing for a month - not enough time to learn how to do it well, IMO.<p>People pair for all sorts of reasons - as a continuous code review, knowledge sharing, and mentoring; but as the OP described, it comes at a cost - of flexibility, and of innovative design[1]. It takes experience to learn how the cost/benefit of pairing stacks up for any given situation[2].<p>One of these days I'll get around to documenting pairing ant-patterns I've witnessed. For now, here's one:<p>Guerrilla Pairing: Programmer A is in the middle of a task. Programmer B is blocked waiting on something so feels the need to pair, notices Programmer A is unpaired, and jumps in. Programmer A will now spend time bringing Programmer B up to speed, at which time, Programmer B becomes unblocked on her original task and jumps back to that, rendering the disruption in Programmer A's day pointless.<p>[1] Any design that cannot be communicated orally or sketched out in code in under 5 minutes is unlikely to emerge from a pair.<p>[2] Situations including type of work, availability of a pair, etc.",1362451832

Especially if one part of the pair develops outside of work and the other does not. This creates resentment and results in the more skilled developer having to use less elegant solutions to a problem so that the other developer can understand what is happening.<p>Additionally, I feel long term pairing creates tunnel vision and stifles innovation as there is no time to stop pairing and think out a solution. The focus is cranking out features without spending the time that you get working alone to get more creative.<p>The lack of creativity is actually a side effect of the increased productivity. You are definitely more productive working as a pair because there are no breaks. You can't check hackernews, reddit, etc when you have some watching everything you do. I view this as a good thing, but I wouldn't be checking those sites during work time anyway. Sometimes I just need a few minutes to research alternative solutions instead of just going for the first one that the pair comes across.<p>In my view, pairing works best when used in moderation. Adding a new team member? Have them rotate and pair with different team members for the first 4 months. Pairing will get them up to speed with the rest of the team in no time. The new hire will learn the programming culture of the company and experience various team members insights.<p>I think pairing together to work on a feature on an occasional basis is also a great team building strategy. The key is moderation and rotating the pairs so that it doesn't become stale.<p>Having experienced the Pivotal way for a good amount of time, I feel they have taken pairing too far.",1362451673

In my experience a lot of people are like this (programmers, parents, executives, creatives, lawyers, etc) and we all find our own ways to cope. For me it was a realization of my own body and mind (and that I'm normal) and not buying into someone's diagnosis or someone else's coping strategy.<p>One of the most reassuring pieces of advice I had during sleepless nights in high school was from an adult who told me he can't sleep a lot and instead of tossing and turning he seizes the moment and works, since that's what he's thinking about anyway. I'm not saying this is healthy advice, I'm saying that he helped me feel normal by letting me in on his coping strategy. Others will tell you they drink tea, or workout, or avoid sugar or caffeine. They all work--for them--and we should take everyone's advice with a grain of salt because we all have very different minds/bodies/lives. I guess the author here found a coping strategy that happened not to work for her, so thank you for sharing.<p>I'll share my strategy: I take trazodone occasionally as needed to sleep. I let myself get all worked up and be very productive for as long as I think it's healthy for me. Eventually I get on a weird cycle and this corrects it for me. There are all sorts of other things I do but there are so many variables in life, and this is the only one I view as relevant. And who knows, in a few years I might have to try a new strategy.<p>Everyone's weird and bizarre and has problems. We should stop stigmatizing illness, eccentricities, addiction, medication and start realizing that we're all different and have the potential to be healthy if we find what works for us. Also don't always try to find the root cause and be pragmatic more often.<p>Also, I should add that I share these details sort of like people do when they admit they're gay. It's not without risk, but I hope someone reading this is helped. And if you think I'm being overly dramatic, this does not apply to you then, because I'm being way underly dramatic.",1362450200

There was a time when I was developing/running/debugging on a rather large network of in situ oceanographic sensors when I had four monitors arranged in a 2x2 grid.<p>Since then I was forced into working on some small, low-res displays in some cramped/uncomfortable environments.  There's nothing like being afraid of heights and debugging code at the top of a swaying hydraulic scaffolding to make you want lightweight, productive efficiency.<p>I migrated to using yakuake, and now iTerm2 in a quake-like setup, and I do most of my coding in vim.  I set the terminal and vim to the solarized-dark color scheme, and set the background at 80% opacity.  I find this allows me to focus on what I'm doing but still ""peer"" through to see reference material behind the terminal.  Further, because the terminal rolls down from the top with the press of a hot-key, I find that transitions between browsing/etc and writing code are very fluid and the burden of a mental context switch is minimized.  This setup allows me to be incredibly productive on a 13"" rMBP.<p>I recently had the opportunity to switch back to a multimonitor setup.  I found that I spent too much time worrying about how things were tiled to make appropriate use of the real-estate, and began to wonder why I ever craved four monitors.  In the end I just went back to my normal quake-like terminal/vim usage pattern as I feel this helps me focus better, and I really like the feeling of not being tethered to my desk/chair.",1362449803

Tom could tell us. (Tom I really want an in depth post on wingtip!) But to do fast real time search for hundreds of airlines you need more than a fast schedule (time dependent graph) you also need the complex fare rules worked out and programmed. All of that data is available but costs. The last bit is you then need to check availability via wherever you can book the ticket (GDS or direct to airline) and cache it for speed. I think that the fact that Tom links to Vayant's price cacheing api it is an admission that it isn't raw data that's lacking it's a higher level api where fares and availability are already worked out.

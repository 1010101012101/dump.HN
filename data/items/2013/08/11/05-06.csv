The highest caffeinated teas have about 80mg per 8oz, while the lowest caffeinated coffees have at least 80mg per 8oz. Coffee will always be more caffeinated than tea.<p>Second, teas have tons of vitamins, catechins, phenolics and tannins, which your coffee does not. This is like quitting Red Bull and switching to a multi-vitamin that contains small amounts of caffeine.<p>All tea is made from one single plant: Camellia Sinensis. (Yes, one single plant!) The only difference between teas is how they are processed. Here is a flowchart of the different types of tea processing: <a href=""http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/13/Teaprocessing.svg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/13/Teaproces...</a><p>The healthiest tea to drink is &quot;young tea&quot; with partial sun, steamed instead of pan-fried (so Japanese instead of Chinese) and picked by hand, to reduce old pickings, inferior lower leafs and possible introduction of aluminum by machine sorters and fluoride by fermentation. For the most caffeine (and more traditional Chinese medicinal use), get pu-erh. <a href=""http://theteaspot.com/about-tea.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://theteaspot.com/about-tea.html</a><p>If you wanted to quit caffeine using tea, go from pu-erh to black, green, white teas and steep each a little less each time (or re-infuse the leaves for less potency and continued use). You can also drink herbal tea, which isn&#x27;t actually tea at all.",1376200699

6194006,comment,6191350,6192221,9,0,lobster_johnson,,,"It&#x27;s true that it is harder to design a model based on different viewports and so on. However, this does not excuse the ridiculous shortcomings of CSS, especially in this case.<p>CSS doesn&#x27;t really <i>have</i> vertical positioning within arbitrary boxes, which is insane if you think about it. This shortcoming has nothing to do with viewports or fonts or whether it&#x27;s screen or paper. After all, the rule &quot;box B is to be vertically centered within box A&quot; is not dependent on a particular medium such as print or screen. The rule &quot;box A is to be 100 pixels tall&quot; adds medium-specificity, but that&#x27;s different.<p>Rather than providing rich high-level rules to create simple, responsive layouts, CSS makes one jump through hoops to accomplish trivial things like vertical positioning, and gets mired in finicky micro-details and a cumbersome, inflexible layout model. It breaks down quickly; for example, only recently, with the introduction of &quot;box-sizing: border-box&quot;, has it been possible apply percentages to box sizes that have padding. (Before, if you had two boxes with &quot;width: 50%&quot;, they would wrap if you applied padding.)<p>As an aside, I am personally not convinced that the CSS promise of separating presentation from content has paid off. In any serious web app, the DOM <i>is</i> visual, and separating CSS from the DOM makes no sense. It&#x27;s useful as a way to organize code and to share style rules, to be sure, but those benefits don&#x27;t come from content/presentation separation. I wish we had an inverted model  a visually oriented language concerned only with presentation (think SVG, only not limited to vector graphics), with a separate data language concerned exclusively with data.",1376199839

As for complaining that ABAG takes control of housing away from city governments, you seem indifferent to the fact that ABAG is an association <i>of</i> local governments. The various counties around the Bay Area (with whom city governments already had to deal) are entirely within their rights to work together, and frankly it seems a good deal more efficient to coordinate some things through a medium like ABAG than to come up with 9 separate plans that take no account of each other and would result in 9 separate bureaucracies to administrate them and so on.<p>Downtown SF and SJ are already quite dense, and while I&#x27;m in favor of them getting more dense your notion that smaller cities lying along the 280/Caltrain corridor are some sort o rustic havens doesn&#x27;t make sense. As I said earlier, if you really want to get away from it all it would make a lot more sense to go to Half Moon Bay or even Portola Valley, whereas Palo Alto is situated along 3 major transit arteries (101, 280, and Caltrain). I&#x27;m sure you&#x27;ve lived in Palo Alto a while and don&#x27;t like to see it change, but look at a map; all the coast around the Bay is dense and you&#x27;re sitting in between 2 cities with populations of around a million that are only about 45 miles apart. I&#x27;m <i>not</i> particularly sold on the ABAG plan, but I am quite in favor of working together and having a plan instead of just muddling along pretending the various counties around here don&#x27;t impact each other.",1376197310

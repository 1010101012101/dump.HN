Perhaps you didn't read what I said very closely, considering I actually explicitly pointed out that I read it, and found your writing engaging, as well as appreciating what appeared to be brutal honesty about yourself.<p>Sorry if I misunderstood your meaning in several cases.  I think there's quite a bit of ambiguity in how you phrased things.  If you are not able to see where I could come to the conclusions I did, I suspect that either you are being just a smidgen willfully blind about it, or you are just being an asshole.  I reserve judgment, given that I don't know you.",1297061893

This commercial purposely fucks that manipulation up.  It's like a middle finger to the soulless beer commercials that I find tiresome, the ""being told what to like"" mentality.<p>This commercial also has a point, in an Emperor's Clothes sort of way.  People are angry because they don't like feeling like their concern for whales, Tibet, or the cause du jour is insincere even if they aren't doing much to actually contribute.<p>If you're offended, step back and look at why.  Is it because you don't like thinking about how absurd American culture is (in effect if not intent), importing Tibetan food for trendy twenty-somethings to enjoy, turning concern for rainforests into absurd Disneyland-style Rainforest Cafes.  Because that's a _true_ analysis.  If you're upset because a commercial is an _accurate portrayal of life_, then that's not entirely sensible.<p>On the other hand if you're upset because ""They didn't do commercials right, they're supposed to follow a pattern/distort data/just be funny,"" I'm unimpressed with your orthodoxy.<p>The world is absurd.  I like a company that is willing to spend millions of dollars to point that absurdity out using itself as an example.  People aren't going to stop buying groupons because of this ad, and a successful ad campaign wouldn't save them from going bust like Pets.com (as is documented elsewhere).<p>In other words, _this ad meant nothing anyway,_ and it embraces that to actually be pretty funny and insightful.<p>In my opinion.",1297061407

(Plus, this is an author who admits he's lied about his contract numbers in the past.) From my read the facts are damning enough:<p>* He'd gotten a big advance on his previous book but it didn't sell. (Money loser = big red flag #1)<p>* His reputation alone no longer sells a book idea (evidenced by the sudden need for him to write a proposal to sell a book.) (Warning flag.)<p>* His financial judgment is suspect. (""The Forever Portfolio"" delivered to the publisher just as the market starts a giant slide.) (Warning flag.)<p>* His last book was, well... Here's a sentence from the first Amazon review: ""That said, the book is horribly written -- the author has about 20 pages of interesting content interspersed with 200 pages of random digressions, about his love of computer games and the longest words in the English language."" (At the very least, a warning flag.)<p>* His proposal read like it was cribbed from Wikipedia (Big red flag #2.)<p>* He's a real peach to work with, insisting he knows other people's jobs better than they do (after all, he claims he chose the $20 price point for the previous loser, and we know how he treats his agent). (Warning flag.)<p>Now look what happens when that book idea (not the proposal) finally sells -- the publisher insists on bringing in another, trusted writer as co-author.<p>Sorry, but I don't think there's a mystery here that the agent needs to solve.",1297059032

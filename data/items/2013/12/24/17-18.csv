And that&#x27;s fine.

6960343,comment,6957502,6957502,1,0,bakhy,,,"I agree that the distinction needs to be made, although the exact difference between the two, as many of the comments have already stated well, is hard to define. A good post.<p>Nowadays academia is under ever increasing pressure to produce fit-for-work experts, and seen from such a perspective it really can look pointless. I personally strongly disagree with such a view. IMO, it should appear to be pointless! It should broaden your thinking and introduce you to the cutting edge of the field, not just specialize you for a certain line of work. There should be programs which will do only such a specialization, but a full-on CS course is supposed to be more. In the end, how well you will work will depend on a lot more than just the school, but a good school will help.<p>The Law of Leaky Abstractions is, perhaps, a good argument for why it is useful to learn all that theory even though in practice it is rarely needed. Sometimes, you just need to know what is going on behind the scenes.<p>P.S. I always have the feeling that the Dunning-Kruger effect is strongly present in these discussions. The first programmer that I heard claiming that a degree is useless is also the guy who didn&#x27;t know what a DB transaction is for and when he should use it. It&#x27;s not a huge deal, we fixed the bug, taught him, and then he knew. But - not knowing such basics, how could he possibly know what else he is also oblivious about?<p>We need good schools to teach us that we don&#x27;t know shit.",1387907799

Today, the average worker works ~37 hours.<p>Assuming job accessibility (which I have no idea if there&#x27;s a guarantee of or not), and more reasonable home purchasing, I think it&#x27;s not &quot;simply false&quot; that one can live the same way as they did in the 50s on the equivalent working wage, one simply has to make more apt comparisons to see that the goal posts have shifted.<p>The average 1950s family only owned one car, while the average family of today owns more than one (likely, to support the second job).  If each of us bought houses half the size of what we&#x27;re currently buying, and half the cars, we&#x27;d likely be in greater parity with our 1950s brethren.

That is 5.475¢ per day (I&#x27;m assuming a year of 365.242 days; if you do an integral number of days and account for leap years, then it will be a different daily rate in regular years and leap years). If you are doing calculations which pro-rate certain things per day, such as allowing people to transition between different subscription types while applying their existing balance to the new subscription, and you rounded that down to 5¢ per day, then when you multiplied that back out to a year it would only be $18.26 per year, not $20 per year. That&#x27;s a pretty substantial difference.<p>Where you fix your precision depends on how much error you&#x27;re willing to deal with. In the article, he describes how using millicents leads to an error of 165m¢ (.165¢) per year, if you apply the rounded daily rate and multiply by the number of days, which is deemed acceptable for their purposes.

Is this growth inherent in the nature of government or because of some greater social needs, or are there other causes? In Crisis and Leviathan, Robert Higgs shows that the main reason lies in government’s responses to national “crises” (real or imagined), including economic upheavals (e.g., the Great Depression) and especially war (e.g., World Wars I and II, Cold War, etc.). The result is ever increasing government power which endures long after each crisis has passed, impinging on both civil and economic liberties and fostering extensive corporate welfare and pork. As government power grows, writes Higgs, it achieves a form of autonomy, making it ever more difficult to decrease its size and scope, and to resist its further efforts to increase its reach, so long as the citizenry remain uninformed of its true effects. One of the most important books ever written on the nature of government power, Crisis and Leviathan is a potent book whose message becomes more trenchant with every passing day.</i> -- <a href=\"http://www.onpower.org/about.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.onpower.org/about.html</a>",1387906846

Why should I care?<p>I&#x27;m not trying to be a troll.  I&#x27;m trying to understand.  And I don&#x27;t.<p>I&#x27;ve been a professional programmer for 28 years.  I don&#x27;t care about &quot;the one right way&quot; or &quot;ideological purity&quot; or anything like that.  I care about efficiently building programs that work.  (Answers that say that functional programming is in fact the one right way will be dismissed as ideologues or trolls.)<p>I don&#x27;t think that functional programming can be the one right way, because I have spent most of my career in embedded systems.  Those programs tend to be full of states that changed many function calls ago, but are still relevant.  If I understand correctly, that doesn&#x27;t play well with functional programming.<p>But once you don&#x27;t buy that functional programming is the one right way, then you have to ask, &quot;When is it the right tool for the job?  And when is it not?&quot;<p>(And by the way, once you don&#x27;t&#x27; think that functional programming is the one right way, then things like tail recursion and the Y combinator stop looking like elegant solutions to important problems.  They start looking like crocks that you were forced into because you&#x27;re using the wrong tool for the job.)<p>Look, I get that all of computer programming is mathematics.  It&#x27;s all Turing machines, too, but that doesn&#x27;t mean that I want to write programs like I&#x27;m writing on a Turing machine.  I don&#x27;t want to write them like I&#x27;m writing an abstract algebra paper, either - unless there&#x27;s a real benefit.<p>Again, I recognize that this sounds like a troll, but I&#x27;m really not.

Done! Launched! And it works amazingly well.</i><p>Mind you, this is from 2007 and there&#x27;s more to the story -- Sivers learned a lot, as he says, from hiring a Rails guy and from the attempt to use Rails:<p><i>It’s the most beautiful PHP I’ve ever written, all wonderfully MVC and DRY, and and I owe it all to Rails.</i><p>At the end, he describes his 7 reasons why PHP worked out better in his case and they may well make sense in other cases as well -- that is, while some of these reasons reflect his personal tastes (e.g. <i>#6 - I LOVE SQL</i>), some are solid business reasons, like reason #2, which I&#x27;ll quote in its entirety, since it&#x27;s worth keeping such considerations in mind:<p><i>#2 - OUR ENTIRE COMPANY’S STUFF WAS IN PHP: DON’T UNDERESTIMATE INTEGRATION\nBy the old plan (ditching all PHP and doing it all in Rails), there was going to be this One Big Day, where our entire Intranet, Storefront, Members’ Login Area, and dozens of cron shell scripts were ALL going to have to change. 85 employees re-trained. All customers and clients calling up furious that One Big Day, with questions about the new system.<p>Instead, I was able to slowly gut the ugly PHP and replace it with beautiful PHP. Launch in stages. No big re-training.</i><p>I&#x27;ll suggest that, like other writings by Sivers, this is worth reading since the issues he dealt with in migrating to a rewritten system are ones that are not uncommon.<p>(For a list of all his blog posts about entrepreneurship, music (and the business of music), life, etc.:<p><a href=\"http://sivers.org/blog\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://sivers.org/blog</a>  )",1387906208

Some other guy warns him: what are you doing, are you crazy? But he pulls the trigger and nothing happens. The other guy warns him again, stop it man, you&#x27;ll kill yourself. Again, nothing happens. This goes on for a while, until at some point, say the 14th try, the guy blows his brains out.<p>Well, this same thing happened with situations like the recent economic crash.<p>Now, some people view it like the person giving the warning was wrong 13 times, and only right once. They&#x27;ll say, dismisingly, &quot;Well of course he eventually got it right: he always kept to the same warning even when he was wrong. Even a broken watch tells the right time 2 times a day, etc&quot;.<p>But I&#x27;d argue that that person was right ALL ALONG. Even when nothing had yet happened. And that if some other kind of action was chosen as he warned it should be (e.g putting the gun down), the tragedy would have been avoided.",1387905649

And the early benefit washes out pretty quick once you spend more than a couple days on a project.

Many of the people in this line of work are selling low or mid end projects to smallish businesses premised on leveraging functionality built by the large WP community.<p>That said, even though I could do projects in other systems:<p>I am usually working with agencies/consultancies who _want_ WP because,<p>it is super easy to find folks who can work with WP on some level,<p>their clients are familiar with WP,<p>and it is trivial to meet a bunch of marketing or CMS goals with it.<p>So while WP doesn&#x27;t &quot;suck the least&quot; (I know of stuff I like better), it&#x27;s still a good tool for a lot of reasons that have little to do with the code.  For marketing objectives, you&#x27;re going to have a hard time finding something objectively better for the total cost of ownership (there are, of course, better eCommerce, community forum, and application systems).<p>And your position self-selects for a particular kind of client... you&#x27;re probably not seeing the folks who are doing the $10K-100K projects I see, in which the server management isn&#x27;t farmed out to a hosting company.",1387904735

6960127,comment,6959405,6959826,3,0,ispolin,,,"The thing that helped me most when I started learning clojure is to mentally move the parenthesis over to the other side, so<p><pre><code>    (println (max 34 64 15))\n</code></pre>\nbecomes<p><pre><code>    println(max(34,64,15));\n</code></pre>\nand vice-versa.<p>Another thing that helped is realizing that almost all things that require special syntax in other languages look like function calls in clojure. So, for example, to create a new function, you call the defn &quot;function&quot; and pass it parameters for the name of your new function, the expected arguments, and the body of the function.<p>The last thing is remembering that in clojure, the last statement in the body of the function is automatically the return value of the function, so I just imagined that the last statement had a &quot;return&quot; call in front of it.<p>With these 3 rules I could mentally translate 95% of clojure* to c-style code and back.<p>*The other 5% is mostly about macros, which are what give clojure (and other lisps) the power to add new features to the language via libraries, among other cool things. They they&#x27;re powerful and used sparingly though, so you won&#x27;t bump into them too much, and when you do, most will be documented as to how to use them properly.",1387904714

You&#x27;d end up with multiple functions like heartsGameCardValue and euchreGameCardValue but with int cards you need to write the same thing and without a type system to catch errors. If it was truly simpler to reason in terms of int, you could also do a cardIntegerRepresentation function and it would add very little length to the codebase.",1387904705

The incentive for Alice could run deeper than that, maybe only if she has got her friends to join will she be able to see all of Bob&#x27;s pictures or learn about his sexual tastes. There could also be advantages for Alice&#x27;s friends, because Alice introduced them to the site they might get the advantages Alice has for a limited period of time.<p>As soon as you &#x27;gamify&#x27; people will cheat, e.g. in the above example, Alice might create half a dozen accounts, one for each of her various email addresses.\nObviously you would need a method to make this not happen, and, if you solved it, you might have a competitive advantage.

6960118,comment,6959405,6959931,7,0,adrianm,,,"This is so true - what interesting to me is that I have heard this sentiment directly from friends and coworkers before several times. Upon further prodding, it has been the case that their dealings Haskell were minor at best, and are confusing the superficially similar syntax of Haskell with languages they&#x27;re used to, thereby giving them the idea they understand the code they&#x27;re reading. But more often than not they really don&#x27;t understand it - the brain is apparently adept at making us think we understand something we really don&#x27;t based on a superficial, usually structural similarity with an existing knowledge domain we have.<p>I recall interviewing a potential hire who lauded his appreciation and understanding of functional programming - and he really believed it. So I asked him to explain to me what a closure was, and give me some examples of ways you can exploit them in your code, practically. Pretty straightforward question for someone who claims to understand the concepts of functional programming.<p>Of course, I wouldn&#x27;t be bringing this up if he was even remotely successful, but I don&#x27;t think this was a result of his presenting himself in a dishonest manner. I think closures are subtle ideas; much like function application, composition, and other ideas that seem familiar and easy to understand until you are asked to apply them practically. That&#x27;s when the gap between what you think you know and what you actually know is borne for the world to see.",1387904434

8570538,comment,8566982,8566982,0,0,cmapes,,,"I&#x27;m curious how this works with the legal landscape of US regulation.<p>I&#x27;m 99.9% sure the law would consider this equity compensation in exchange for labor performed, since this is being positioned as &quot;getting a share&quot; of the company. The only difference between standard &quot;sweat equity in exchange for labor&quot; agreements and this is that there are &quot;coins&quot; that represent a certain percentage of ownership instead of a standard contractual agreement bearing stock certificates.<p>That opens up a whole can of worms in terms of questions:<p>- Can the project owner further dilute the &quot;coins&quot; of the project, by increasing the total coin count? (Can prior work be diluted, thus lowering earning for prior work?)<p>- What kind of financial reporting requirements to companies have that work through assembly? Sarbanes oxley compliance? How do you know that they&#x27;re reporting accurate earnings and not short-changing developers?<p>- Are these just &quot;amorphous projects with a DBA&quot; aka an informal partnership or are they all required to be corporations or LLC&#x27;s?<p>- How about implicit liability?<p>If someone were to do an amount of work equal to 10-20% of a company&#x27;s ownership equity, and the company did something illegal, wouldn&#x27;t the developer have implicit ownership since he was profit sharing with the company? Would this open the developer to potential liability? (disclaimer: not an attorney, and it&#x27;s been a while since I looked at related laws, but I remember reading some surprising case law that implied this a while back.)<p>- Possibly most importantly: How does this work with the SEC and IRS regulatory landscape?<p>How is this viewed by the SEC? The SEC requires that any exchange of securities be subjected to extreme regulations (you must take your company public to sell shares to public investors). When I raised money for my angel round, I had to seek SEC Rule 506(d) exemption just to provide shares to my initial investor base and to sweat equity to myself and my founder.<p>Most SEC exemption types carry additional reporting requirements for companies that have &quot;non-qualifed&quot; stockholders. This means monthly financial reporting that is SOX compliant by a CPA among other things IIRC. For the record, &quot;qualified investors&quot; have a net worth of $1mm+ or access to internal information that allows them to make knowledgeable investing (or in this case, investment of the developer&#x27;s labor). These developers won&#x27;t qualify simply by developing software for the company, as they need to have access to executive-level information.<p>In addition, SEC exemptions need to be filed by the actual companies in question. Those exemptions have a window of time during which they&#x27;re valid. Different exemptions have different maximum non-qualified investor counts before the company must go public. That may mean that there&#x27;s a maximum amount of different developers that can develop and receive sweat equity on a project before it reaches a ceiling, depending on interpretation of the law.<p>Finally, how does this affect the developer&#x27;s taxable income? If he were to receive these equity shares (whether called &quot;coins&quot; or not), the IRS is going to deem these coins as having some sort of a value, just like stocks do. There&#x27;s a lot of case law here, and typically it&#x27;s going to work out to be (company valuation / ownership percentage = effective income amount). The IRS doesn&#x27;t simply have you pay on dividends received from your equity, it has you pay the value of the equity as income as well, so how about with these coins? The IRS will see this as an asset received for labor, so how will this affect the taxable income of the developer? Do you require the companies on assembly to post a credible, running, monthly valuation by a 3rd party investment bank for taxation purposes? How do you handle the possibility of phantom taxation?<p>I apologize if this seems negative, I think the idea is (potentially) pretty sweet. I just hope you and your founding team talked with some good attorneys before building out this business. As a startup CEO myself, there&#x27;s a lot of basic regulatory issues that I see with it which would have prevented it from passing the initial &quot;idea vetting&quot; process.",1415318016

8570513,comment,8570027,8570027,0,0,lkrubner,,,"I just had an interesting experience interacting with a CTO who writes a blog. (If he is okay with it, I&#x27;ll post his name later.)<p>I was between jobs, and I asked myself, &quot;Where do I want to take my career next?&quot; and I decided that I wanted to move in the direction of Big Data and Analytics. I already knew of an analytics company that was doing cutting edge stuff with Kafka and Storm, so I sent the CTO an email (I had briefly met him once before at a Meetup). He said &quot;Yes, let&#x27;s talk&quot; and we scheduled a talk for 1 week in the future. I had that week mostly free, so I decided to spend that time studying the company. And I was amazed and how much I could learn about the company, because this is pretty much the first company I have ever applied at where the CTO writes long, thoughtful posts on his personal blog.<p>I have worked at WineSpectator.com and Timeout.com and ShermansTravel.com, and even though all of those are publishing firms, none of them have any public information about their technology (this is changing, slightly, in the case of Timeout.com). With each of those companies, I basically went in blind, with no idea of what they were doing.<p>In contrast, the analytics company was transparent: they had released some important software to Github, so I was able to review the code, and read the issues that other developers had raised. They had also started a mailist on Google Groups, so I was able to read over dozens of public conversations regarding the strengths and weaknesses of their technology. And the CTO posts 2 or 3 posts each month, to his personal blog, most of the posts being long and in-depth. I read everything he had written during the last year, and so I was able to get a good sense of why he had made the decisions that he had made (why use Kafka and Storm) and where he&#x27;d like to evolve the company&#x27;s technology stack.<p>Because of all that, I felt like we were able to have a high-quality conversation (via both Skype and email). I didn&#x27;t need to ask stupid beginner questions like &quot;So, uh, what do you guys do?&quot;<p>The argument against blogging is similar to the (now largely discredited) argument that used to be made against open-sourcing one&#x27;s own technology: if you give away the company&#x27;s secrets, then your company has no unique advantages. I can recall, during the 1990s, people would look at you like you were crazy if you suggested you were going to give away part of your technology. But over the last 20 years, the whole tech industry has become much more comfortable with the idea of open-sourcing some of a company&#x27;s technology.<p>Having a public blog is a bit like having a public open-source project: it raises your exposure, and perhaps even facilitates the process whereby others can help you. And the limits of both strategies are the same: I think it is rare for a company to open-source 100% of its technology, and I think it would be rare for a CTO or CEO to share 100% of their thinking on a blog. But sharing part of the technology, or part of one&#x27;s thinking, can clearly have benefits.",1415317597

So it makes sense for it to be built out by the municipalities themselves.<p>Both sentences are debatable. Regarding the first sentence, it&#x27;s possible that the optimal firm count in some communities and especially sparsely populated areas is one (i.e. an actual natural monopoly), but in most communities I would expect it  top be at least two or three, since broadband can be delivered through phone lines and cable television lines (which most communities are wired for). There are obviously other feasible media, like power lines and wireless. Could you explain why you believe that last-mile infrastructure is inevitably a monopoly?<p>Regarding the second sentence, it&#x27;s debatable that government control is a good solution even in situations where the optimal firm count is one. An <i>ideal</i> government solution may be better than the <i>average</i> private solution, but likewise the ideal private solution may be better than the average government solution.

8570486,comment,8569409,8569409,0,0,roymurdock,,,"Advertising in its current form is broken.<p>I was recently in a class where we performed a case study on Google. The professor asked if anyone had ever clicked on an ad. One kid out of 60 had clicked on ad for cheap protein supplements, but hadn&#x27;t bought any. Everyone else scoffed, pointed out their use of AdBlock, and cited their gullible parents as the only people they knew who might ever possibly accidentally click on an ad. Furthermore, the strong majority of our class viewed targeted ads on Facebook and Gmail as extremely creepy and unconvincing.<p>There are two ad models that work in my opinion:<p>1. Native advertising: Ads disguised as useful content. This works for changing people&#x27;s perceptions, especially if its done through official or generally impartial channels, such as news outlets. People think they&#x27;re getting honest information about BP&#x27;s charitable acts and Coke&#x27;s health benefits, but they&#x27;re really being lied to. This doesn&#x27;t generate any direct sales, but it can really influence consumer sentiment on different brands which can have a massive impact on sales indirectly. This method is extremely sneaky and unethical, and that&#x27;s probably why it works.<p>2. Snapchat&#x27;s new model: Opt-in, high quality ads. I liken these ads to movie trailers. They are well-crafted and curated, and you only have to watch them if you want to. This way, people who click on them are already intrigued and have committed to watching the ad, making for a more engaged and curious user base. This method is still being developed but I can see it become big in the next couple of years.",1415317181

I was relatively lucky to land a client a few days after starting to look at a reasonable rate (was a fixed price, at the end of the project >$20/hr)editing a premium one page WordPress theme for a small business in Australia. I then made some simple web advertisements and a simple personal page for a friend of mine.<p>After finishing that first project (a bit later than I wanted, but the client was happy), I went back to those same sites to continue my search for clients. After researching on my own and spending time on these types of websites, I quickly realized that I was not going to get a steady flow of work at reasonable rates.

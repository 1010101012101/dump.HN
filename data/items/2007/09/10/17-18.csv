You have the option (but not the requirement) to encrypt by using rsync in concert with ssh.  <p>Incidentally I do transfer private business data over the network, encrypted, every single day, usually many times per day.<p>[1] <a href=""http://samba.anu.edu.au/rsync/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://samba.anu.edu.au/rsync/</a>",1189447177

Hopefully people will realize that you shouldn't have to pay for ringtones, people will continue not to buy singles when they could buy the real single for $1 from Apple, and the music industry can find a real business model.",1189446183

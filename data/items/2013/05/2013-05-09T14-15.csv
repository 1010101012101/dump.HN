There's lots of goods and services for which this is close enough to reality for the theory to mostly hold, but there's not much reason to think that healthcare is among them (and comparative quality and cost measures among real world healthcare systems don't support the idea that its a market where more ""market forces"" equals more efficiency.)",1368111417

This applies to even things like DHL packages, the government can't tell the DHL delivery guy to hand over a package to them.<p>On the other hand, it's not a privacy violation for the DHL guy to <i>voluntarily</i> turn over material to the government and the government to use that as evidence against you. Think of the stereotypical ""guy at the photo lab"" who notices that someone dropped off child porn to be developed, you (sadly) used to see that in the news yearly, and no one thought anything of that being turned over to the government.<p>In some cases third-party services have privacy protections added by law. E.g. the cellular communications interception thing, it used to be very easy indeed to intercept a cell phone call just by sticking up an antenna. In 1994 the law was changed to make it illegal to intercept those calls in most scenarios, and require search warrants even for that ""public transmission"" of communications (but the law also required cell phone companies to make it possible to wiretap, the ""CALEA"" provisions).<p>Given how strictly regulated banks are I would be very surprised if there are not similar laws providing some semblance of legal protection to the contents of safe deposit boxes, but I'm not sure and don't have time to Google it.",1368111299

Instead of the usual, boring list of requirements, we just want to see if you have the mojo for this. Create a 5 minutes video, with your voice over, in which you explain one of the following platforms:<p>a) Amazon Web Services
b) Microsoft Azure
c) Google Compute Engine
d) Rackspace Cloud<p>We will evaluate your video and if we love it, we will contact you for additional interviews. Good points will be assigned for good pronunciation, high quality, engagement. This video represents half of your hiring process: you better nail it right!<p>At Cloud Academy, we like to trust our employees. You can work from home as much as you please, as long as you stay in touch with your team. You can pick any software, OS or technology that will do the job, as long as we love the results.

Salary for the first three months will be 6,300 US$. Salary for the full-time position depends on how great you are.<p>At the moment, we strongly prefer to hire someone living in the European Union or United States and with work permit to work there.

One must categorize and ""contain"" meaning, trap it in language a moment in order for it to remain meaningful, but paradoxically the external thing that it symbolizes is always changing, so it's always escaping any semantic trap we set for it. This of course has practical (concurrent) implications in software as well as the high-falutin metaphysical stuff Plato was talking about.<p>These days I'm starting to wonder more about how we may not be using state-machines quite as effectively, or as often, as we might -- changing functionality more aggressively as the data changes, in order to move towards a better analogy with the ever-changing ""real world"" that software is trying to model.

Steve mentioned state machines off-hand on the list a while back, and that stayed with me, as someone with a disposition towards Husserl and Bergson and Whitehead and a general Process approach -- that state machines, in the broadest sense, might provide a practical, code-level starting point to focus attention on the ""flow"" of objects, interfaces that adapt to context and communicate that context to one another. This, combined with more focus on a functional approach and reducing state to manage concurrent issues (where the most practical ""ontological"" concerns seem to erupt!), might move a ""philosophy of code"" towards something practical -- if nothing else with a deeper awareness of the general ""incompleteness"" of all languages and their necessary analogical nature. This at least might mitigate ""language wars"" and the search for the ""one best way"" of coding.<p>EDIT: A minor quibble: maybe ""phenomenalist"" isn't the best term to use in close proximity to Husserl. He used the idea of ""phenomenalism"" in contradistinction to ""phenomenology"" -- the former being a kind of reductionist approach to seeing essences as merely the ""contents of consciousness"", and the latter -- which is to say the general Husserlian approach -- sees essences, or ""eidetic objects"" as phenomena that intend towards the external world, at least external to subjectivity.",1368110302

There are symbols and nonsymbols.
    2. Symbols can be equality-compared (eq'd).
    3. Nonsymbols can be observed for behavior (in symbols returned) but not eq'd. 
</code></pre>
The set of symbols is countable and includes:<p><pre><code>    1. Natural numbers.
    2. Unique symbols for arbitrary ""dictionary words"", e.g. _error. 
</code></pre>
Nonsymbols represent mappings that take nonsymbols or symbols and input and return nonsymbols or symbols. That's not well-defined (and it's not even a <i>set</i>) but we are only concerned with those that return symbols (i.e. can be observed) after certain input patterns. For example, A : {_ => A} and B : {_ => B} are both nonterminating but behave identically based on what we can actually observe; it's meaningless to argue about whether they are ""the same"" and since nonsymbols can't be eq'd, also unanswerable.<p><i>Code</i> (as in source) is essentially a process that takes a natural number (viewed as an array of <i>bounded</i> natural numbers) and converts it into something that <i>behaves as</i> a nonsymbol, at least over inputs we care about. Of course, there are many nonsymbols that we can't represent in code, such as one corresponding to the Halting Problem,<p><pre><code>    {$sym => 0, $nsym => 0 if exists k s.t. apply^k($nsym, 0) is a symbol,
     1 otherwise.}
</code></pre>
Maps, vectors, and sets give us tools for describing extremely well-behaved (finite support; returning _error on the not-found case) nonsymbols in code; functions give us a language to describe well-behaved infinite-support nonsymbols.<p>The neat thing about traditional functional programming is that it carries an implicit will to focus on well-behaved nonsymbols. Object-oriented programming hasn't stepped away from the full space of nonsymbolness-- and that's a big part of why it's so damn hard to reason about it.",1368110263

I just got an email from Hackerrank checking in on why I haven't submitted any new code since the transition from InterviewStreet.<p>I do not feel like it is a waste of time or energy, particularly since I use sites with problems as learning tools.  For example, I used InterviewStreet for a few problems while playing with Clojure.  But if I had good opportunities at the day job for hard-core hacking with Clojure, I may never have fished around looking for something like InterviewStreet.<p>I don't care about the contest part but really like the problems from sites like yours.  I do like seeing how many hackers have attempted vs successfully solved a problem.  Can't remember if InterviewStreet did that.  Rosalind (a bioinformatics problem/learning site) has a really nice ""level"" system and I'm guessing you have something similar setup for badges at Hackerrank.<p>I very much like that you offer a variety of programming languages, but I might slightly prefer the Rosalind bioinformatics problems where you submit a solution within a time window rather than actual code to run.  But it's cool since you don't force an ""only python or ruby"" language choice.<p>Hackerrank's FAQ mentions building a community. I would participate much more if I thought the community of same language coders would offer feedback/code review and mentorship.  I'd be willing to also give feedback on an anonymous basis.  For example, say I solved challenge X in Clojure.  I'd probably take time to review another successful solution for challenge X from another participant that also used Clojure - I would hope I could offer constructive feedback or learn how I could have solved the challenge better myself.",1368110089

You call a function to fetch the posts in an object. You then use a pretty bog-standard while loop to loop through that object. You do call a method of said post object to determine whether or not the loop should continue - is that considered bad practise generally?<p>I understand why a lot of people think the WP loop is badly constructed. The start of a typical loop in WP is this:<p><pre><code>    if (have_posts()) : while (have_posts()) : the_post();
</code></pre>
which is essentially shorthand for this:<p><pre><code>    if (have_posts()) {
    	while (have_posts()) {
    		the_post();
    	} 
    }
</code></pre>
I think the cause for some misgivings is that people might not realised that <i>have_posts()</i> is actually doing this:<p><pre><code>    return $wp_query->have_posts();

So you're actually just running a method on the global post object. You'll make similar post objects for custom queries, and interact with them in an identical fashion.",1368109922

I created this web app as a simple tool to automatically build a schedule for a list of selected movies at the festival.  This tool takes the pain out of building a schedule--just select films that are interesting and let the tool do the rest.<p>If you're curious for more details, the scheduling algorithm uses some simple heuristics to generate a schedule since there's an exponential increase in potential schedules as you select more movies. Specifically I pick films that have no conflicts and use a lookup table of movies being shown each hour to more quickly check for conflicts.  There's also some logic to weight the decision of a showtime based on different criteria like if the showtime occurs on weekends, early in the day, late in the day, etc.  The algorithm isn't perfect and specifically doesn't try to schedule two films that only occur at the same time (I'd rather defer to the user to pick films that resolve conflict).<p>And yes, the tool uses a painfully stock Bootstrap CSS.

Workers are in an economy which is still at a historically high unemployment rate that has not been seen since the summer of 1992, and before that 1984.  In a profession with a mass of data of age discrimination over the age of 40, with plenty of able older programmers looking for work.  With interviews where candidates with necessary programming experience and necessary language experience and even necessary API experience are nixed because they're not so familiar with the specific areas of the job required API that people need.  Unemployment is at a historic high, and they want tens of thousands of more open jobs on the market to be whisked away.  Means more unemployment, lower wages, longer hours.<p>There is no argument here, there is nothing to argue about.  It is not like some scientific enquiry where scientists sit around and argue a matter all honest and searching for the truth.  This is a struggle over how the pie is divided up.  The heirs who provide the majority of money to VC funds and the public markets are the ones who created and wrote this legislation.  It is for their benefit and against your benefit.  If one makes ""arguments"" against this in this struggle over money, in this carving up of the pie, it all basically boils down to the statement ""I am, or on the benefiting side of, the billionaires looking to profit off your labor"".  Those opposed are those doing the work like myself.  There's no real arguments, just declarations of which side of the fight you're on.<p>As for maudlin, mawkish comments about the dreams of immigrants and the like - fine, we will keep the H1-B cap where it is, and make a lottery of all people who seek to immigrate, of any skill level, and let more people in that way.  I'm sure immigration will mean more to some poor Guatemalan then some Indian IIT graduate who can live a decent life in India with his CS diploma.

For junior roles, just give the ""Classic 3"" (three references you choose) and be done with it. Don't try to set it up as a consulting contract. You probably won't be dinged on references so there's no point.<p>It's more of an issue for upper-tier roles where reference checks are actually competitive-- i.e. turning up 6's and 7's means you don't get the job because they expect 9+, some of your references have to be supervisors/executives, and more than 3 plus back-channel are involved. That's when you should seriously consider charging. Hiding it in a PDF that no one reads is preferable.<p>Honestly, I'm inclined to give the ""Classic 3"" for free: 3 references that I pick to validate that I'm a capable person. I'm not going to play Internet Badass and claim that I charge for that; that's free. I know, at this stage in my career, that I'll usually get the job given that (if they really need 9.5+ level references and I can only give 9.0; then they weren't that into me to begin with). However, if they start to play ""We need to speak to a supervisor"" with me, then I start to charge because they're making me do above-board consulting work and I'm only willing to do that for free if I get the job.",1368108287

And probably a lot of people too.<p>I don't want to sound snobbish and arguing without helping isn't the way to go in the open source community, but man, all that stuff that has been in development for so long, thought of in dusty university rooms, presented in worn 70's summer dresses...<p>It reminds me of the old tailor couple around the corner. They wont go away and probably have a lot of years to life left. A handful of people still value their skill and love to pay more. But it's an old house that hasn't been painted for a long time. You will only find it in the yellow pages and even then you're having trouble to actually find the shop because it's tiny and the house looks like it's soon to be demolished. The machines they use are old and they are the only ones who actually know how to fix them. If they die the shop is gone for good.<p>The same goes trough my head when I look at Vim's homepage, or Molenaars. They look like someone died or moved on to a life without the internet.<p>They don't make the impression that anything of value can be found. But in some places there is, scrambled across different pages by different people of different generations. Modern technology hammered into old shells. A reminder here that scripts can also be found on git. A wiki hosted on wikia there. GUI builds for Mac here, Windows there, none using any new features of the OS. It still runs, but there isn't really any love put into it.<p>If people talk about Vim plugins I only hear how bad VimScript is. If I install one I get it on github, not the script repository because that's where the skeletons lie. The installer I use (and the only one up-to-date) is made by the cream developers. No clue what I'd even do if they stopped producing them.<p>Vim became the double-edge razor a long time ago. It's cheap, it just works and I can pass it down to my kids. All it needs is some learning. But it's only noteworthy because every other kind of razor produced today sucks in one way or another.",1368108197

It was way more difficult than it had any right to be, not only because of the strange format of WordPress themes (Why would you call a function to start a loop?) but also because WordPress didn't ship with any theme that could serve as a good example.<p>The default theme was, and still is, too bloated for learners to wrap their heads around. It has too many features, too many branches, and too many sub-templates extending the main template, due to the fact that it also needs to serve as a showcase for all of WordPress's features. I resorted to downloading the most minimalistic third-party theme that I could find, cleaned it up some more, and used it as a base for all the themes I've written since then.<p>I'm glad that someone finally made an open-source theme specifically for the purpose of being a rock-solid base for other themes. This is something that should have been done by the core developers 10 years ago. I don't know how much longer we'll have to suffer the sprawling spaghetti monster that WordPress is, but since a lot of us are stuck with it anyway, why not make our lives easier for the time being!<p>P.S.

I would avoid picking up the phone at all costs, and at networking events I would grab coffee and then hide behind my laptop. It wasn't until I started putting myself in an actor's frame of mind that I could get comfortable with it.<p>I should emphasize that I was an actor in college. Specifically, I did improv comedy. So networking should have been easy, but I just psyched myself out or didn't engage  when I had the opportunity.<p>I got over it with methods and practice. I kid you not, I made a script: ""Hi, my name is Sean and I'm a business analyst. What line of work are you in and what brings you to this conference?""<p>Unsurprisingly, that worked really well.<p>I also reverse engineered things that other people did when talking to me. An appropriately timed joke is a great way to break into a conversation, or a question about one of the panel discussions. Simply asking, ""What did you think about X, Y, and Z,"" can open the door for someone to comfortably network. I found that exchanging business cards was really easy after that, and most people would respond to a follow up email if asked to elaborate or share sources.<p>Another trick is to find opportunities to introduce people to one another. Learn what people are hoping to get out of the conference, and if you've spoken to someone with a similar interest or a need, connect those people. That tends to be a great way to ensure they will respond to your follow up.<p>Also, sharing information. This might not be helpful to everyone, but at the time I was doing this work, Turkey seemed esoteric to a number of the foreigners I met, while I've been here for seven years (and thus, I don't really see it as exotic anymore). I would ask comparative questions about a person's sector and how it works back home, and then by making observations about how things work here, I earned a lot of unexpected credibility. At that point, it was much easier to relax and break character at events, and a reply to an email was almost guaranteed.<p>I should note, however, that I never had to sell anything. That is something I wouldn't know how to begin to comment on.",1368108006

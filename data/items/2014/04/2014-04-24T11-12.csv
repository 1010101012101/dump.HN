7639644,comment,7639214,7639397,4,0,HeyImAlex,,,"Yep, it&#x27;s best us case is basically acting as pythons anonymous function (since lambdas suck for everything but the most trivial things).<p>Where in js flask might read app.route(&#x27;/&#x27;, function(){//do something}); python uses a decorator right above a regular function definition. The alternative is to manually add it after it&#x27;s defined (in flask that&#x27;s add_url_rule), but that kind of hides the intent of the function and is more cumbersome as you need to manually pass in the fn name.",1398340761

One of the first reason I like to write a nice command-line tool when I start a project, say foo, is to be able to do `foo --help` to quickly see and remember what the project can do (I have a very bad memory and doing this makes it possible for me to jump back faster to a project, even well documented. I can forget what I was doing in just a few days and so I add a lot of small commands).<p>In short running `foo --help` should be instant and if it loads all its modules to list the different sub-commands and their respective description it is really too slow.<p>A possibility is to cache some information (e.g. generate a text file or a small Python script).",1398340622

However, I think it&#x27;s not quite as simple as he describes (although he may be intentionally simplifying for his audience).<p>It&#x27;s true that financial assets compete with each other for investors. So when the Fed reduces the yield on Treasurys or MBS, the marginal investor will rotate to a riskier asset. This will create a chain reaction that eventually raises equity prices. However, it&#x27;s not the case that earnings yield (Earnings/price or the inverse of P/E) is going to be equivalent to the interest rate on Treasurys (T-bills). Typically the way that investors think about it is earnings yield = Treasury rate + equity risk premium. So at an equity risk premium of 5%, even a Treasury rate of 0% would result in an earnings yield of 5% or P/E of 20, not infinity. This isn&#x27;t too far from the market multiple of the S&P 500 right now. (The historical average ERP over the past century has been 4.2%.) So the market multiple implies that the overall market is not in a bubble, but that doesn&#x27;t eliminate the possibility that some sectors are in a bubble.<p>The Fed&#x27;s influence on the market goes beyond their impact on interest rates. One reason for the sharp rise in markets is that investors are fearful of inflation. Although CPI inflation has remained low, investors would rather hold scarce assets such as equities and real estate than a rapidly diminishing percentage of the money supply (i.e., cash) that results from money &quot;printing&quot;. While money creation is nothing new, and in a sense, unconventional money creation is not that different than conventional easing, the sheer scale of our current monetary policy is unprecedented. This lack of precedent creates a high degree of uncertainty in the ultimate outcome.<p>The final reason for the strength of the markets is a widespread belief that the &quot;Fed put&quot; is back. It is almost universally believed that the Fed has taken on a third, unstated mandate of stable and rising equity markets, by easing and talking the market up when it declines. I don’t know to what extent this is true, but the mere notion has created a hidden source of instability in the market by giving investors unusual confidence. While there is no reason to believe that markets will crash, it&#x27;s also not out of the question.<p>The Fed has announced that it will &quot;taper&quot; QE purchases from $75 billion / month to $55 billion / month. At the current rate of taper, QE purchases could reach zero by the end of the year. One key question for investors is whether this may reverse any of the three dynamics listed above.",1398339683

They can surface an arbitrary amount of extra functionality with a single statement.  For example, ensure a function is only accessible to authenticated users by simply saying something like @requires_authenticated_user. Another example would be to create a logging decorator to wrap a function or a class to create a log of every time the function is accessed @log_function_access. Or to wrap a function to ensure that every access to the properties of that function are pushed through some sort of validation or transformation @validate_set or @transform_get. Decorators allow encapsulation of functions within other functional concepts with almost no code, that&#x27;s the design decision for using them.",1398337706

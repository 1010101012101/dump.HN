Still, I do it because I like it.

In that light, Dota is like most sports, you play because you like it, but you also produce a spectacle to fans in the process.<p>Photography, for me, is similar. I take photos because I like the process and the output, not specifically so other people can see them. There&#x27;s a tradeoff there, but I&#x27;m not sure I could say that playing basketball is useless, for example (although that has more health benefits than Dota).<p>It&#x27;s a hard question.

Here, it boils down to the philosophical/political freedom-vs-safety question, and I strongly incline towards freedom. Go does not.

This video was made one year before today, using a version of nphysics that was at least 5 times slower than the current one.<p>Also, unless the gravity is artificially boosted, things may still look a bit slow because of the scale issue described by aaronetz (in all the demos, most objects are around 1 meter tall, and the camera is far enough to see them all). AFAIK, it is not uncommon on e.g. video games, to artificially increase the gravity so that things look a bit more dynamic.",1410867141

It would be the same if you were measuring your photography skills by one-upping other photographers on a some kind of daily amateur photography tournament.<p>I like to look at things as training skills (see my 10-100-10k model, [0], nicely improved by noahl). If you never played DotA before and sit on it for a dozen hours of so, you&#x27;ll be familiar enough with it to decide whether to continue deliberately training it to get better, just play it casually for fun, or drop it altogether. The first implies that you have a goal, so I&#x27;d classify this as productive (towards that goal, maybe you really want to be on top of a local ladder, or whatever it is in DotA; I don&#x27;t play it). The second means that it&#x27;s just recreation for you, and it&#x27;s fair to classify it as such. We all need to do something for leisure, one man plays football, another plays guitar, yet another plays StarCraft.<p>In other words, I classify things as something I either deliberately want to get better at (thus doing it is productive), or do just for fun without caring about improving the skill (thus this is doing things for fun). Both ways of spending time are good, but it helps to be clear about which is which.<p>[0] - <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=8197334"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=8197334</a>",1410865927

He&#x27;s simply saying the spotlight makes it difficult for him to stay sane (see first and last paragraph) and he doesn&#x27;t want to be pushed into roles he&#x27;s not (e.g. CEO, entrepreneur). He wants to be himself without all the issues that come with fame (see the video he linked).<p><i>> he wants people to like the process of creation.

Rainbow t-shirt included.<p>Not only did I decide it was &quot;OK&quot; to have interests and passion outside of work, I embraced the idea. Recently, I&#x27;ve come around to the other side of the spectrum and have been using my interests to build my professional skills.<p>There&#x27;s a point to the electives traditionally opened up in a scholastic schedule. In my opinion, the whole idea was to provide a space to try new things, to follow new interests, and maybe even fail. As has been noted in at least one book and arguments elsewhere, our society as a whole seems to have fallen into an excellence myth. That you must be passionate and succeed at everything you attempt.<p>I see this as the reflection side of the professional passion movement. &quot;Keep trying, you&#x27;ll get better&quot; sounds too much like a kid&#x27;s jingle.

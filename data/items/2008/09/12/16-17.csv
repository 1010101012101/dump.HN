Windows programmers, Mac/iPhone programmers, server-side programmers, Javascript programmers, enterprise Java programmers, and Linux kernel hackers need to focus on different things.<p>In the absence of details, all we can recommend is basic mental conditioning for programmers.

Statistically/financially, it's a dumb decision to start a startup-- but it doesn't matter.  You can sit down, run the numbers, make pro/con lists-- but it doesn't matter.  You've already lost.  Here's what you can't match:<p>1) The big win.  You can heap stock options on him, but your board will block you from giving a dev more than 1% or so, I presume.<p>2) His baby.  His own company.  A sense of TRUE ownership.<p>3) A clean slate.  New companies/new products are more fun than existing ones for a lot of people.<p>4) Having ANY boss.  Everyone rolls their eyes at even the best boss SOMETIMES.  The irony is that, if he succeeds, he'll be that boss.  But it's a great feeling to NO MATTER what, be able to fix something that organizationally broken if you think it's important.  To be where the buck stops.<p>5) Fame/notoriety.  Some people are motivated by this.  If your startup wins, he'll be an unnamed dev in a winning startup.  If his startup wins, he'll be the guy the led it there.  Either way, it feels WAY cooler to say ""I own my own company"" when someone says, ""so what do you do?"".<p>Doing a startup isn't a sensible CAREER decision...

It's a nice idea to try and give an employee what he's looking for from a startup within your corporate environment, but it's just not possible.  Corporate employees exist to build wealth for someone else.  That's just the reality of the situation.  There are a lot of benefits that come with corporate life, primarily stability, but if he wants freedom, he won't get it working for someone else.  When I was an employee, I had to remind myself that every benefit and incentive was an addicting trap, designed to keep me from leaving.  A steady paycheck will erode an entrepreneur's soul over time, because you come to rely on it and striking out on your own is that much harder.<p>To be clear, I think it's commendable that you're trying to provide a great environment for your employees, but I think the best case scenario here is that you'll work hard to keep him, and you might succeed, but something inside him will die a little and he'll always wonder if he made the right choice.  Why not just let him go give it a shot?  I think it'll cost you more in the long run to fight it than it would to just get a new employee.<p>And I know we don't want to get sidetracked on this, but entrepreneurs do not ""quit their boss"".  They absolutely do quit their jobs because they long for the freedom and rush of creating something on their own, no matter how awesome their boss is.

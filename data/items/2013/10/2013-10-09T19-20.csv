Optimizing documentation to make rediscovering knowledge easier may be more beneficial.<p>If knowledge must be fresh, then either apply the knowledge or share it with someone else. Knowledge can be applied by trying to improve a process instead of merely repeating a process (research and development). Knowledge can be shared in many contexts that give business value (marketing, selling, supporting, documenting, training).",1381348788

I don&#x27;t want to hate on someone&#x27;s efforts, but I am failing to see how this will be of benefit for anyone? I could just be missing something, like the mission or vision, also, FWIW-- I hate NPM. I think it is one of the worst I&#x27;ve used... I stopped using Node on persoanl projects because of it (though it has gotten marginally better since I stopped).<p>If this was to be a shell, I could see it being useful... There are a few similar projects out there.

The Pentium IV tried holding decoded instructions (or traces, rather) in the instruction cache, but it didn&#x27;t work out very well.  The complications induced by lining up the different instruction sizes with the previously specified jump targets and the fact that decoded instructions are much bigger made that approach less successful.<p>Intel Sandy Bridge and later processors do keep a sort of L0 instruction cache full of decoded instructions with all the annotations needed to sort out branching.  It can hold 1.5 K uOps, which is certainly something but not so big that you won&#x27;t be missing it regularly.",1381348724

Think of how many billions of humans existed simultaneously with John von Neumann without being anywhere near his level. If we figure that Neumann was mostly due to a stellar combination of alleles, then that implies he got lucky on a very large number of alleles (imagine a bunch of alleles which can be on or off, and Neumann got all of them &#x27;on&#x27;; then because he was 1 out of 5 billion or whatever, he got log_2 5,000,000,000 = 32. This is not 1 variation, which is easy to select on, or 2, but 32. The current state of the art, using n=100,000 is around 3 SNPs.

6523423,comment,6522973,6522973,39,0,jimrandomh,,,"Yes, this is definitely needed. There are two angles to investigate: checking the cryptography itself for mistakes, assuming good faith; and checking the packages for backdoors, if this is questioned. Given that the TrueCrypt developers are anonymous, both are required. I won&#x27;t get much into the former - but I&#x27;ve thought a bit about the TrueCrypt foundation, and when I looked into it (not in great depth), it looked odd to me, so I gave some thought to where back doors would be located, if there were any.<p>If TrueCrypt is back-doored, the backdoors are likely only present in the binaries offered for download on truecrypt.org, not in the source code, where they would be more easily found. A cross-check of important routines might be informative. A back door would take one of two forms: either it&#x27;d smuggle a copy of the key somewhere, or it&#x27;d lower the key&#x27;s entropy enough to be crackable. The former would be discovered by simple disk-space accounting, so it is probably not the strategy used. Reducing the key entropy would make any volume decryptable if it was first initialized by a backdoored copy of Truecrypt, while retaining compatibility with non-backdoored copies; so likely places are in the key-generation, or in the random number generator that feeds it.<p>Also noteworthy: the download links all work by POSTing to /dl, then being redirected. The Windows download link for me went to <a href=""http://www.truecrypt.org/download/transient/e2ec88b9b7dfb3a8fee9/TrueCrypt%20Setup%207.1a.exe"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.truecrypt.org/download/transient/e2ec88b9b7dfb3a8...</a>, and it&#x27;s not clear what that big hash is doing there - other operating systems use a different URL scheme (without the /transient/10bytes component). Their web server might occasionally give different binaries to people it doesn&#x27;t like. All the downloads are over http, not https (except for signatures); and their site responds to https in a very odd way, responding with a valid certificate but always redirecting to non-https.",1381348335

They could say &quot;this apartment complex has a static mobile phone&quot; and also &quot;this same apartment complex is where the regional director of operations lives&quot;.

6523362,comment,6517553,6518527,1,0,BrianEatWorld,,,"Thats the correct debate, although you are probably better off just reading their books and deciding for yourself. I think that particular debate session got hung up on a lot of minutiae.<p>As for the direction of your project, I think as opposed to solving all the problems at once, you may want to construct things piecemeal, while laying out the factual pros and cons of each political &quot;module&quot;. For example, using Arrow&#x27;s Impossibility Theorem, there is no way to create a perfect voting mechanism, so any voting mechanism you put in place will be a traeoff. At one extreme, is unanimous consent, this guarantees everyone is signing off and thus reasonably happy. However, unanimous consent creates a new problem of the holdout position. To balance, voting systems like majority rules limit the holdout problem, but also introduce consent issues like swings in opinion from mob rule and the tyranny of the majority. On the opposite end of the spectrum, you could create an elected dictator that could decide. This would be a trustee style system and while it would limit the above issues, it would introduce principal agent problems. By building these individual modules, you could allow your system to be adapted to many situations and allow for the actors themselves to police the less desirable behaviors (IE they know to watch out for holdouts before the process begins), which would be listed in the cons. A similar decision process could apply to the bonus systems (should education enter into it?), systems for evaluating relevant info in the debate section (types of source material, reputation voting) and so on.<p>In sum, allow the users to determine how they want to decide and mediate each decision before they enter into the process. A module setup may also help you make more progress on your own and get contributions.",1381347772

So the only two things it needed to do was perform and receive calls, and allow me to manage contacts.<p>It fails miserably on the second one. The only options to import contacts are through Facebook, which I don&#x27;t use, and from a SIM card, which is what I ended up using. Pretty limited, to say the least, but the real kicker is that it has no option to actually <i>export</i> contacts. So if you use it for a while and decide either to wipe the device, or to stop using it, you have no option to retrieve contacts you&#x27;ve since added. I&#x27;ve investigated if it was possible to at least back them up using an ADB shell (it is, supposedly it&#x27;s an sqlite DB), but apparently you need root on the device to do this, which isn&#x27;t possible on the default install. I didn&#x27;t investigate any further when I realized I was actually using Android debug tools at 3 am to get my contacts out of a supposedly consumer ready device.<p>Needless to say any software updates probably aren&#x27;t forthcoming from ZTE, since even the upgrade routine fails with an error on these devices (<a href=""https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/questions/967817"" rel=""nofollow"">https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/questions/967817</a>).<p>Another thing that bugs me is that while Mozilla are distancing themselves, and their branding, from the likes of the Geeksphone Peak+ (<a href=""http://techcrunch.com/2013/07/25/peak-plus"" rel=""nofollow"">http://techcrunch.com/2013/07/25/peak-plus</a>), which as far as I can tell receives timely updates and has a vibrant community, saying it&#x27;s not a Firefox OS phone, they&#x27;re also busy directing people to the manufacturers (ZTE in this case) whenever there is a problem with the officially blessed Firefox OS version running on the first consumer grade FFOS phone.<p>Next time I waste more time trying to get basic functionality working, I&#x27;ll just build my own updated images of FFOS (<a href=""https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Firefox_OS/Developer_phone_guide/ZTE_OPEN"" rel=""nofollow"">https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Firefox_OS/...</a>) and see if things have improved by then.",1381347112

Not &quot;officially off-limits&quot;, mind you, but busy enough that you&#x27;ve got to deal with <i>their</i> assistants merely to get onto their calendar; and doing so may attract attention from their underlings (still at least one level above <i>you</i>), who may try to influence things before your meeting if they&#x27;re aware of your agenda.<p>* Management ego: if the senior management in question has been in their position for quite a while, they may bristle when informed that their master plan has some holes in it.<p>* Management ego, part II: if you&#x27;re relatively new to the company, you may have considerable difficulty getting buy-in from the old guard.<p>* Drowning new management: if senior management has recently undergone a turnover, the new kids in charge may be drinking from the firehose and unable to grasp the enormity of what you&#x27;re saying.  Or, worse, they rely on the input of a longtime company veteran whose &quot;contributions&quot; over the years may have directly caused the problem.<p>* Out of sight, out of mind: problems for <i>you</i> and your peers may be not be seen as a problem for senior management, especially if there is a great disparity in working environments.  Work in a cube on a noisy floor while senior management has large, quiet offices on a different floor (or a different building)?  They might not be sympathetic to complaints about your inability to concentrate.<p>* It&#x27;s all about the Benjamins: ultimately, management is guided by two things.  The first is money; if it&#x27;s rolling in at the same or greater pace than last year, <i>there is no problem</i>.  The second is risk; if you can&#x27;t specify a specific risk to future business...again, there is no problem.  Worse, if somebody can provide a toothless risk mitigation plan that <i>sounds</i> good but does nothing to actually solve <i>your</i> problem, then senior management may still consider the whole thing moot.<p>This is why many folks -- especially the ones who have been around long enough to have burnt by one of the above a few times -- simply advise suffering employees to look elsewhere.<p>It&#x27;s not about apathy, it&#x27;s about preservation of sanity.",1381347001
6523281,comment,6522901,6523178,13,0,gojomo,,,"Increasing your score on an IQ test is one thing; getting the benefits expected from more &quot;intelligence&quot; may be another.<p>In such matters, keep in mind Goodhart&#x27;s Law: &quot;When a measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a good measure.&quot;<p>In the domain of IQ, we might observe a very high correlation between higher-IQ and certain desirable results, like a longer/healthier life, lower rates of victimization, higher incomes, and so forth. And we might have a strong case that the test is, at least at the outset, measuring some sort of &quot;general intelligence&quot;, and that there is a causal link from &quot;general intelligence&quot; to the other correlated beneficial outcomes.<p>But, then you start aiming to increase &quot;general intelligence&quot;, and your only measure is the IQ test, so your target for evaluating all interventions is the IQ score. Now you are quite likely finding interventions that <i>only</i> raise the IQ score, and perhaps skip any &quot;general intelligence&quot; benefits. Even if your IQ score goes up, you might not get the other benefits. Meanwhile, others still researching the correlation/causation questions may see the original correlations start to weaken, or the case that IQ measures &quot;general intelligence&quot; weaken.<p>And in fact the originally-valid ideas are weakening! Motivated action around that target has started to thwart whatever signal it once offered.<p>The problem is universal - in regulation, in education, in investment, in semantics.

6523277,comment,6521885,6521885,3,0,scythe,,,"I find the overall argument to be rather weak. The most relevant problem is that it starts on a premise that might as well be this: &quot;Intelligence is a substance, and a nootropic is a drug that makes the brain produce more of it.&quot;<p>Of course I&#x27;ve intentionally phrased this as to make it seem ludicrous, but throughout the article he talks of &quot;more&quot; or &quot;less&quot; intelligence as though it were a fungible sort of thing. Really, though, intelligence is just a way that human beings interpret each other&#x27;s behavior, related to performance on various tasks (mathematics, etc). There&#x27;s no particular reason to assume that evolution would have optimized for, e.g., skill in mathematical analysis, and therefore there isn&#x27;t any particular reason to assume that even the silliest of low-hanging fruit wouldn&#x27;t have been picked, for instance an elderly and distinguished analyst, such as Paul Erdos, may benefit from taking amphetamine.<p>There are also radical differences in what we measure as &quot;IQ&quot;, which is mostly performance on a battery of strange tasks, and the sort of mental performance that leads to evolutionary success. There are, for example, arguments to the evolutionary sufficiency of ADHD[1], OCD[2].<p>1: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunter_vs._farmer_hypothesis"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunter_vs._farmer_hypothesis</a><p>2: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocd#Causes"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocd#Causes</a><p>More critically, though, is that this represents yet another article on the basis of &quot;I-think-it-oughta&quot; evolutionary reasoning. You think &quot;intellectual low-hanging fruit&quot; ought to be selected for, but you don&#x27;t have empirical evidence. The claim is based almost entirely on hand-waving and citations of Eliezer Yudkowsky, who is not in any case an authoritative source [3], and whose claims have not been in general accepted by contemporary neuroscientists [4].<p>3: <a href=""http://rationallyspeaking.blogspot.se/2010/09/eliezer-yudkowsky-on-bayes-and-science.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://rationallyspeaking.blogspot.se/2010/09/eliezer-yudkow...</a><p>4: notably absent here: en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evolution_of_human_intelligence and here: <a href=""http://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=evolution+intelligence+algernon&btnG=&hl=en&as_sdt=0%2C11"" rel=""nofollow"">http://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=evolution+intelligence+a...</a><p>Meanwhile, experimental evidence is contradicted. For instance, amphetamine <i>is</i> correlated with improvements in IQ, not to the tune of 20 points, more like four[5]. In fact, things as random -- and ostensibly detrimental -- as <i>mescaline</i>[6] can improve certain aspects of mental functioning, albeit at the cost of others. That what are essentially shots in the dark can produce noticeable improvements in certain qualities bodes well for rational drug design, which has been a success in other fields e.g. cisplatin vs. imatinib.<p>5: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amphetamine#Medical"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amphetamine#Medical</a><p>6: <a href=""http://www.medpagetoday.com/Psychiatry/Addictions/2070"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.medpagetoday.com/Psychiatry/Addictions/2070</a><p>Another thing that is important to keep in mind is that the workings of the body can be <i>highly</i> counterintuitive. For instance, one might expect choline supplementation to increase the level of brain acetylcholine. It seems natural, right? But it&#x27;s not true[7]. Furthermore, while piracetam&#x27;s effects are commonly considered to be affected (and side-effects reduced) by choline supplementation[8], it is now generally believed to act primarily as an allosteric modulator on ion channels linked to AMPA-sensitive glutamate receptors[9]. Facile reasoning of the sort &quot;what negative effects might have prevented evolution from doing this&quot; thus cannot, itself, tell us very much.<p>7: <a href=""http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/mrm.1910390619/full"" rel=""nofollow"">http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/mrm.1910390619/fu...</a><p>8: popular claim on longecity et al, e.g.: <a href=""http://www.pillscout.com/2013/06/17/your-piracetam-dosage-is-wrong/#comment-36"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.pillscout.com/2013/06/17/your-piracetam-dosage-is...</a> , <a href=""http://www.bluelight.ru/vb/threads/181563-any-piracetam-users-out-there"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.bluelight.ru/vb/threads/181563-any-piracetam-user...</a><p>9: <a href=""http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/jm901905j"" rel=""nofollow"">http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/jm901905j</a><p>The most immediately difficult claim to me is the advocacy of spaced repetition, when it is not clear why the claims of the article necessarily apply to drugs but not to techniques such as this -- could we not evolve to use it instinctively?<p>For all this, there is a little useful data in the article.

6523225,comment,6521517,6521517,4,0,EGreg,,,"Let&#x27;s be clear here.<p>Anonymity can be maintained even if the pattern of communication is not &quot;normal&quot;. What you need for anonymity is for the parts of the system(s) you interact with to not identify you. This certainly should apply to the nodes you interact with directly, so they should be under your control (e.g. the user-agent software, the computer you use, the facility the computer is located in, etc.) Further out, the system components have to not have a centralized ID of the endpoints. Cellphone networks DO have a centralized hub, namely the cellphone company. The key to anonymity is to make sure that none of the parts of the system can identify you, either because they don&#x27;t require a centralized ID, or because the ID provider / facility / computer you used to access the system is unwilling or unable to identify you.<p>The way that governments and other organizations combat anonymity is by requiring various systems to identify other parts of the system (e.g. cellphones) with unique identifiers before letting them use that system. There are only two ways to defeat this:<p>1) Create a fake user-agent, to impersonate existing identifier(s), or<p>2) Circumvent the requirement to identify oneself.<p>The first one will put individuals you impersonate at risk, but it is likely they&#x27;ll be let go and not subjected to &quot;rubberhose cryptanalysis&quot;. The second one will eventually attract the attention of the governments. If they can set things up in such a way that systems (e.g. Lavabit) that refuse to identify individuals are somehow punished, their license to operate revoked, etc. then this should prove a deterrent to anonymity.<p>In the real world there are plenty of systems in the world who do not care about who is sending the data through the wires (net neutrality is related). Some of them are tunneled over other systems. Tor is an example, Freenet is another. They use primarily legitimate, identified accounts (e.g. someone in their home using an ISP) to transmit this tunneled information, sometimes over a protocol that is indistinguishable from TLS. As long as things like SSL and TLS are allowed, this will be possible.<p>As long as such a system is distributed enough that it doesn&#x27;t have a central way to shut it down, it will be infeasible for governments to intimidate enough operators of the system into shutting it down. These are the ways to have true anonymity. PerfectDark and Freenet are used in countries with oppressive governments.<p>Note that you can have a consistent identity and still be anonymous! This can be great for reputations, e.g. of app developers, app stores, antivirus companies and reviewers of software. I have written a lot more on the subject here:<p><a href=""http://magarshak.com/blog/?p=114"" rel=""nofollow"">http://magarshak.com/blog/?p=114</a><p>What the article describes is that steganography is hard. Acting in the real world while avoiding suspicion of a government with access to many systems (telephone systems, etc.) is hard. Which is probably a good thing. Terrorism is a problem of technology. 300 years ago it was nearly impossible for a few guys to kill thousands -- they&#x27;d be apprehended and stopped first. Today, there is more and more technology that empowers individuals to kill may people. This goes back to the machine-gun debate, but basically as capabilities grow (3d printers printing guns, for instance) so does the surveillance. Sadly the surveillance isn&#x27;t going away, because the technology for both is only increasing.",1381346512

Especially when one considers that high IQ at birth isn&#x27;t eliminated from the gene pool, and marked increases in 1930-normalised IQ between generations doesn&#x27;t appear to markedly disadvantage modern Westerners.<p>Similarly, it seems simpler to accept that the phenotype &quot;potential 140 IQ&quot; is the consequence of specific, rare combinations of certain genes which overall aren&#x27;t correlated with survival, without positing side effects of IQ-linked genes. Ubermensch can&#x27;t be bred because their kids aren&#x27;t clones rather than because they&#x27;re necessarily deficient in other ways.<p>I&#x27;d see the incidence of Tay Sachs disease as a <i>counterexample</i> to the theory that high performance in a specific brain function necessarily has evolutionary tradeoffs. Ashkenazi Jews on average test with higher verbal and mathematical intelligence and lower spatial intelligence than other ethnic groups, which could imply that human brains naturally-selected for optimal function in one area are punished in other areas. Ashkenazi Jews are also more likely to carry the recessive gene for the very rare and very debilitating Tay-Sachs disease. But since 26 out of 27 Ashkenazi Jews don&#x27;t have that recessive gene, which afaik is uncorrelated with IQ amongst Ashkenazi Jews, it suggests the common factor between Askhenazi intelligence and Ashkenazi Tay-Sachs incidence is inbreeding. Reduced average spatial intelligence could, like Tay-Sachs, be the unfortunate effect of a restricted gene pool rather than an &quot;tradeoff&quot; which must inevitably be caused by higher scores in other tests.",1381346253

6523179,comment,6520076,6522551,2,0,saidajigumi,,,"> What are the advantages of using this plugin over using git in the terminal directly?<p>Speaking generally to editor integrations and VCS GUI tools, the prime advantages vs. the CLI tools are:<p>1) Uninterrupted workflow for common tasks. Select files for commit, review the diffs, then commit all without leaving the editor.<p>2) Better visualization and interactive workflow.  Examples include, good intra-line, side-by-side diff.  Being able to `git blame` then trivially explore the associated commits and surrounding history for those commits. Yes, it&#x27;s possible to do all of this from the command line, but it&#x27;s often clunky compared to well-thought out tooling. With some VCS systems and projects, graphical display and navigation of history is helpful for understanding the relative state of branches, tracking down obscure bugs, etc.<p>That said, I&#x27;m not a fan of glossy GUI tools that hide the working model of the underlying VCS.  For the most part, not using the CLI is a great way to never really &quot;get&quot; version control as a powerful workflow tool.  Perforce&#x27;s P4V GUI tool gets credit on this point. The last time I used it, there was a console that showed the command line run and results for every GUI action. This happened to be a nice learning tool, providing relevant, live examples of basic and advanced usage.",1381346104

6523170,comment,6521522,6522926,22,0,lambda,,,"At some point, you need to ask what you mean by 128 bit. When people talk about an 8 bit, 16 bit, 32 bit, or 64 bit processor, they are actually generally conflating two or more things. There&#x27;s the size of general purpose register, the size of the data bus (how much you can load from memory in a single transfer), the size of the address bus (how many lines you have for addressing RAM), and the size of pointers. In many machines, these have been the same, though for example, 8 bit processors frequently had 14 or 16 bit addresses and busses so they could access up to 16 or 64k of memory; but there&#x27;s also, for example, the 68008 with 32 bit registers, a 16 bit address bus, and an 8 bit data bus.<p>So, when people talk about 32 or 64 bits, they generally mean two things: the size of general purpose registers, and the size of addresses.<p>There&#x27;s basically no need for addresses beyond 64 bits, at least for quite some time. With 64 bits, you can address 16,384 petabytes (16 exabytes) in a single process. Since the biggest single machines I can find these days support a maximum of 4 TB of RAM (if you filled it with 32 GB DIMMs that aren&#x27;t yet available), we have a long way to go before you will need more than 64 bits of address space.<p>Furthermore, increasing address size can hurt performance. If your pointers are all 128 bit, they take up twice the space as 64 bit pointers. There have already been plenty of workloads that show a reduction in performance when ported to 64 bit machines, just because the 64 bit pointers fill up so much valuable cache space. In fact, for this reason, Linux even has support for the x32 ABI, which uses an x86-64 processor in 64 bit mode but only uses 32 bit pointers, so they can take advantage of extra registers available to x86-64 without paying the price for the larger pointers. <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X32_ABI"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X32_ABI</a><p>So, there&#x27;s no benefit to 128 bit addresses and lots of potential downside, so it&#x27;s not going to happen for quite some time. How about for data, though?<p>Well, most software doesn&#x27;t really need to work with integers or floating point numbers larger than 64 bits, anyhow. For lots of applications, 64 or even 32 bits is sufficient. Public key crypto can frequently take advantage of large integers, though it generally needs even bigger integers, like 2048 bits, so you generally have to do bignum arithmetic anyhow.<p>Lots of the gains that you get from working with larger types come from working on vectors of smaller types. But for those purposes, chips have had 128 bit registers for quite some time. SSE, introduced in 1999, included 128 bit vector registers, which could be treated as 4 32 bit integers (AltiVec on PowerPC had introduced the same idea a few years earlier; the idea of SIMD has been around in supercomputers for many years). Later extensions like SSE2 expanded their use to allow you to treat them as two 64 bit floats, two 64 bit integers, 8 16 bit shorts, and 16 8-bit bytes.<p>So, for the only use case for which it&#x27;s particularly valuable, working on vectors in aggregate, we&#x27;ve had 128 bit registers for quite some time. We&#x27;ve had 256 bit registers for a couple of years now in the form of AVX. Now this promises to expand those to 512 bits. There&#x27;s no good reason to expand your addresses in the same way; at that point, you&#x27;re just wasting space.",1381346030

The new data is guaranteed to be on the HDD but NOT guaranteed to be written to the non-volatile platter of the HDD. Data is often still in the HDD internal-cache, waiting to be written to the disk platter.<p>The 2nd case (very rare) is when the application attempting sync-I/O opens the HDD in raw mode i.e. opens the block device directly(without any VFS layer in between) with O_SYNC. Now following each disk-write, the AHCI driver issues a CMD_FLUSH to ensure that even the HDD cache is immediately flushed to the platter. As this eliminates any chance for NCQ to kick in, the performance drops by an order of magnitude but data-integrity is ensured.",1381345833

There are some days when I can&#x27;t think of another way to write a <i>fibonacci</i> function (a trivial example... without including obfuscated methods, there are only so many effective ways to implement a function that computes the n-th number of the sequence). On those days I may end up calling to mind a previous solution and simply, &quot;refactor it.&quot;<p>I have conflicting feelings about learning new languages. I do it every now and again but for a craftsperson I don&#x27;t feel that it is the ideal approach. As some monks I&#x27;ve heard say so it is with programming: <i>you can be fluent in many languages but master none</i>. Real mastery requires dedication and focus over time. But that&#x27;s not the whole story, is it?<p>I&#x27;ve met too many developers who will put C on their resume under the assumption that they are capable of writing C programs. More often than not it&#x27;s a bold-faced lie, but when it isn&#x27;t I find they are certainly capable of writing a C program and getting something to compile. However there are very few who understand what sequence points are, that still treat the linker like black magic, and don&#x27;t fully grasp how array and array pointer parameters are changed by the compiler.<p>The point I&#x27;m getting at is that C is generally one of many languages on a programmer&#x27;s resume. And it&#x27;s usually an after-thought. However if you really grill someone on the soup-to-nuts of just one of these languages you can find holes in their knowledge. They learn enough to get something useful done but they don&#x27;t know enough to do truly masterful things with the language. I think about it like being a musician: you can learn enough about an instrument to join a jam but to push the boundaries you need to master one. And mastery is something I find thats consistent, dedicated practice.<p>As to how to measure whether I could have improved more if I had done something else other than master one thing... I think there&#x27;s a lack of bounds there that should be determined by your goals. If your goal is to join a jam and play along then you want to learn as little as possible up front and as much as you can as you go along. I think this is the par for modern programmers these days. But if your goal is to push what&#x27;s possible with a particular instrument then generalizing your knowledge is not nearly as effective as studying music with that instrument alone. Both are valid approaches and it&#x27;s a matter of limiting the scope of possibilities based on what you want to achieve.<p>Though mastery tends towards an asymptotic function reaching, but never achieving, perfection.",1381345811

6523126,comment,6522269,6522919,1,0,nostrademons,,,"That depends a lot on hiring practices.<p>Corporate culture usually starts with the founders and early employees, but is transmitted in two main ways:<p>1. Who they decide to hire.  In general, people tend to hire folks like themselves, and so if you start with an initial core of people with a certain value system, you&#x27;ll end up with a company that reflects this value system.  For example, Google started with a couple Ph.D drop-outs, they hired all their Ph.D friends, who hired their thesis advisors, and so they ended up with a very academic culture.  Facebook started with a college student, who hired some of his college friends, who hired a bunch of young folks fresh out of school, and so they end up with a &quot;move fast and break things&quot; culture.<p>2. Acculturation of newbies.  When a new hire arrives at a place, they instinctively look around for guidance on how to act.  They get it from the people around them - their teammates, their manager, and the people that company holds up as heroes.<p>Either one of those can go wrong.  The first one usually goes wrong in the &quot;A players hire A players; B players hire C players; C players hire dodos&quot; way.  If you start with a core group of confident, energized, intelligent people, they will typically try to hire folks who are equally or more effective, because they view working with top-caliber folks as an opportunity to learn.  Once you start getting some folks who are lazy or insecure in, though, they tend to hire folks who are even lazier and more insecure, because they feel threatened about being upstaged.  That repeats until eventually the whole company is full of non-threatening bozos.<p>The second one goes wrong in periods of rapid expansion.  Here newbies outnumber experienced veterans, and so when they look around for how they should behave, they pick up the culture of their new teammates&#x27; former employers.  It doesn&#x27;t need <i>any</i> bad apples, only the lack of a critical mass of good apples.  This is also why the oldest division at a company often maintains the most of the original culture: oftentimes new divisions are staffed up in a hurry, facing different market realities, and the people in it look toward each other and to the leader of the division to figure out the culture.",1381345393

There are varying levels of sleep. Some better than others. When your body doesn&#x27;t need to go through rem sleep anymore it is sufficiently rested but that doesn&#x27;t mean you feel like a ray of sunshine and immediately jump out of bed. There are other factors which make a person want to stay in bed longer than they should which leads to shitty non-rem sleep. Too much of this makes you feel groggy.",1381345347

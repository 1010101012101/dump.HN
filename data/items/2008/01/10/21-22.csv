96934,comment,96813,96813,0,0,mig,,,"- Get CS3. You would waste more time figuring out how to get the stuff done using free tools. Plus you might not be able to avail use of adobe's help lists/groups.\nYour time is valuable.<p>- Instead of trying to create from scratch, get .swf/.as files for some free/open source flash game and hack your way through. With your strong coding skills, it would be a lot easier to hack through an existing piece of code.",1200002254

96929,comment,96925,96925,0,0,ALee,,,"We launched this product with Politico (our media partner) a couple weeks ago, and we wanted to get YC opinion on it. Think office pools for the presidential primaries and the winners earn Amazon.com gift certificates and a trip to the White House Correspondent's Dinner.<p>This product was not our YC submission because we had already inked the deal before submission.<p>What do you think of the app and the market? Be honest, we want criticism more than anything. We've focused on political games, but found that political consumers are huge news hounds (see huffingtonpost and drudgereport). Should we spin off as  stand-alone site and not be a vendor with other internet media?",1200001472

You can't just upload the files and go on typical shared hosting.",1200001187

96922,comment,96853,96853,0,0,Zak,,,"I just deployed two applications for a client using mod_ruby and eruby. You can just upload rhtml files, and they just work. I may be missing something here, but it seems to me that you <i>can</i> use mod_ruby just like mod_php.<p>Is this the best way to develop most applications? Probably not, but it's good for simple, quick and dirty projects. I'm a big fan of the application continuously running inside the web server as is usually done with Hunchentoot.",1200000993

The research experience of the PhD might help, but it&#x27;s not the solution to all problems.<p>For a more pragmatic point of view, look at where your future professor&#x27;s students are. In a 250+ ranked school, the school name is not going to land you a great job by default. You&#x27;ll need to be working with a good professor. Your summary of the publications of who you are working with doesn&#x27;t seem stellar, but without details on where he publishes I can&#x27;t say much.

How can the third-party site tell if the site is attacking an individual user?  How can the individual user compare the version of the web app they received with the version that the third-party server thinks is appropriate or current?<p>I don&#x27;t mean to dismiss this goal, because I really want infrastructure like this to work and become ubiquitous, I just think it might require a slightly more elaborate architecture with the addition of some kind of client-side component, if you&#x27;re including the original developer in your threat model, and not just someone compromising the servers that host someone&#x27;s copy of jQuery and giving <i>everyone</i> a backdoored copy.",1416970189
8660927,comment,8658283,8659723,0,0,drcomputer,,,"Not defending racism, but how I hypothesize that it happens is as such: People exist in one dynamic where it is accepted and are introduced to another dynamic where it is not tolerated. This leads to a push pull between both dynamics, where the person is constantly questioning which behavior is correct. If the individual thinks about this, and thinks themselves an individual, they may behaviorally react at the constant attempts by others at forcing a definition of behavior or control over the individual.<p>It&#x27;s not really fair because neither dynamic has provably defined a correct way of handling social situations/definitions/behavior, because both behaviors often can be traced back to some kind of &quot;reasonable&quot; adaptation or &quot;successful&quot; adaptation which, when not confronted by an equally successful/reasonable force, can become exaggerated,distorted (not necessarily in a bad way).<p>The problem is some people can explain themselves in a socially acceptable manner, and others can&#x27;t. People with schizophrenia are some of the least likely to be able to verbalize themselves without the fear perception that it will be taken seriously, equally, diligently - if only from traces of memories of prior experience. People with paranoia have difficulty trusting anything, whether it&#x27;s the meaning of a word or the person they are talking to. Their minds operate on a different level that is disconnected (not necessarily in a bad way) from people who regularly socially engage with a reasonable level of social connection. If you can&#x27;t think like a schizophrenic, how can you possibly expect them to be able to communicate themselves in a way that you can empathize with, without them accidentally forcing their own distorted fears onto you?<p>If you had to question every post you made assuming two worlds exist: one in which the post affects you positively and one in which the post affects you negatively, and you can&#x27;t tell the difference between either because the possibilities of how reality can manifest are too numerous (or too obvious) to think about, you would constantly be stuck between deleting half your posts and posting things you aren&#x27;t sure you believe. That&#x27;s enough to make anyone a little crazy, simply because of the resulting ways that influences your thinking.",1416970135

A positive step is that they&#x27;ve been increasingly recognized as serious by people who develop and publish software, so there are significant transparency efforts underway now to try to make it possible to meaningfully tell where software came from, whether it corresponds to published code, and whether it&#x27;s the same thing everybody else is using.<p>(Along with Mike Perry from the Tor Project, I gave a talk about some of these issues at Mozilla recently, which was pretty well-received.  Tor has been very interested in making sure that compromises of their infrastructure won&#x27;t compromise the software their users get, and that the developers can&#x27;t be coerced into giving users backdoored versions; see Perry&#x27;s &quot;Deterministic Builds Part One: Cyberwar and Global Compromise&quot;, for example.)<p>To look at this from another angle, all of these issues are terrible gaps in software security, and terribly exciting opportunities for people to add backdoors (maybe more likely bugdoors), but now we have some tools and ideas that can start to address them!",1416969944

8660918,comment,8659619,8659924,0,0,waps,,,"I find that when it comes to optimizing code with an emphasis on readability, the improvement is rarely only 5%. Plus the improvement is not just the end result&#x27;s performance, but also in writing.<p>I think I don&#x27;t understand this readability thing. I have trouble keeping the structure of large programs in my head. So for me, the number one readability property of a program is it&#x27;s length. The shorter, the quicker I can read it.<p>For other people it seems to be a lot more about code they don&#x27;t understand. List and dict comprehensions are one such thing, especially the iterator-based ones. Using variable capture with in-line functions is another, and God forbid I pass around a function pointer to an inner function, because it often lets me avoid writing an entire pointless class that I have to remember exists. I use functional programming constructs constantly where they make sense, which tends to be a lot of places. Why is all this forbidden ? Is this because people don&#x27;t know what they do/how powerful these constructs can be ? I feel that rewriting a nested list comprehension into a 20 line function does absolutely nothing to clarify matters for me, it makes things worse.",1416969834

The people who lived and died when such ideas/beliefs were not irrational will never know it, same with those who died  thinking it helped them/such things were in their personal interests no matter how &quot;true&quot; such things may have been for x period of time.<p>Maybe if we seek didn&#x27;t limit ourselves to what things can and can&#x27;t be, &quot;receiver of consciousness&quot; wouldn&#x27;t seem so irrational any more than what people now equate to popular science that at some time was equally as irrational but is no longer questioned to the same degree which could be equally as irrational at some point in the future.<p>But yeah, some sr. research scientist phd who studied ap physics and helped build quantum computers and now trying to apply the some methods they learned in a field to psychology/neuroscience where the current &quot;kings of the hill&quot; use surveys and more surveys with the occasional cutting some people/animals open, is probably not going to want to entertain ideas that relate qed systems and qm theories to meditation with meditation instructors not versed in such to any conversational degree, when they have a hard enough time trying to explore such things with neuroscientists they work with who just got some big funding from politicking that in the scheme of things probably wont advance the field any more than next dubious publication that gets plastered over social media and perceived as fact.",1416967279

Authenticate the user against Google if possible, so that it always uses the user's latest password\n2. Enable the user to log in when offline (assuming the user has logged in online at least once)\n3. Enable an SSO experience for Google properties\n4. Allow the user to opt-in to auto-login that still does SSO, but does not cache the user's password<p>We also plan to support alternative authentication systems:<p>1. Give users an SSO experience at OpenID relying parties\n2. Give users an SSO experience at sites for which they've already typed in credentials on a Chromium OS device</i><p>It's a reminder that Google has bitten off a huge chunk here.<p>One other huge example is Gears. I imagine that Google Gears is a central art of the ChromeOS world. But Gears is still really an experiment. Very few people really use it at this stage, certainly they don't rely on it. Very few webapps really have a strong offline mode. Even Google webapps don't have brilliant support yet. You can't even create a new document on Google Docs while offline. What's the workaround? Keep a store of blank document ready.<p>I wonder how much will have come together by the time the first devices launch. The ChromeOS experience at 2012 might be very different to ChromeOS the ChromeOS experience 2010. It seems to me like ChromeOS assumes that problems like SSO, data security, offline webapps, etc. will have been more or less solved pretty soon.",1259110785

960338,comment,960179,960179,0,0,tptacek,,,"Jacques Mattheij seems floored by the idea that you could look at something as obscure as cache timings in a hyperthreading-enabled processor and use it to deduce crypto keys. He's right: it's a clever attack. But if it <i>surprises</i> you, please count it as another reason you should never implement your own crypto.<p>For the past 10 years or so, crypto researchers have been pawing through the x86 microarchitecture (microarchitecture: the part of the processor that isn't directly exposed in the instruction set; best example: cache) looking for side channels. They've found a lot of scary stuff.<p>For instance, every time your processor takes a branch, it's caching the computed branch target; it does that so that it can predict branches, so that when it snorfles instructions into its pipeline, it doesn't have to chuck them when a branch goes the ""wrong"" way. But the branch cache (the BTB) is finite. You can write a process that continuously profiles branch timing to deduce the state of the branch caches, and if that code runs alongside crypto code, it can make predictions about key bits (that's Aciicmez's paper).<p>There's every reason to believe that there are areas of the microarchitecture that aren't documented that have even worse effects.<p>There is actually a practical point to pull out of this (and here I've buried a lede): it is very probably unsafe to run ""secure"" code (SSL credit card processing, etc) on shared hosting of any sort. A motivated attacker can probably get their code running on the same physical hardware, and the odds right now say that attacker can pull key bits out of your processes.",1259110142

960301,comment,959824,959824,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"There are tons of polite openings to negotiation:<p>""Is there room on the price?""<p>""Do you have any offers on this item?""<p>""What's your best price on that?""  One time a mattress salesman responded sarcastically with, ""The one on the tag.""  So, I said, ""Thanks."" and turned to leave.  He called me back immediately with a lower price.  I still left and bought at Costco, instead, since the price was dramatically lower even without negotiation, and I don't like snarky pushy sales people.<p>Another mattress guy once challenged me with, ""Are you going to shop around more once I tell you our best price?"" And my reply to that was, ""Of course."" And he said, ""So why should I tell you our best price now...come back once you've gotten prices from the rest of the stores you're going to talk to, and I'll try to beat it.""  My reply to that, of course, was, ""If you don't give me a price better than what I'm seeing on the tag before I walk out that door, you will never see me again.""  He, too, offered a lower price. The lesson in this is that salesmen tend to understand that the only person who can really say ""yes"" to the deal is the customer, and they've only got one shot at that yes. They do a lot to try to avoid having the customer frame it in those terms, because it's a powerful position to be in. You need one item while they need many sales each day, and you're one possible sale.<p>If those lines are still too confrontational, just say, ""I really like this one, but I'm afraid it's out of my price range..."" and let it hang.  Most people can't stand silence, so if you give it 30 seconds, they'll probably come back with a better price.  Higher end negotiators will know that speaking first when it comes to points of the deal nearly always gets you into trouble, but sales guys at Best Buy almost certainly do not (some sales guys are instinctively really good at grasping human nature, and know this stuff without being told). Car salesmen generally know these things, so you have to be particularly vigilant when dealing with car dealers.<p>A few valuable things I've learned from growing up at flea markets and garage sales (my mom is an antiques and collectibles dealer, and I was her muscle when I lived at home):<p>- No object you're shopping for is precious or unique. Do not get attached to <i>specific</i> items. There are many more just like it or better, in other places, and other times. View it as something you will someday throw away or donate to Goodwill, and you can view it more rationally. That beautiful iPod? In five years it will be trash, and in three you'll probably replace it anyway. In short, always be ready to walk away from any deal.<p>- The deal of a lifetime comes around about once a month. If you're being pressured to buy right away, it probably means buying now is better for the vendor than for you. You should think it over. Reject aggressive time pressure and exploding offers without even thinking about it; if a salesperson insists you buy today to get a specific price, it's likely another store has the item for cheaper and he doesn't want you to price compare. Regardless, you are at a severe disadvantage if you allow the salesperson to set your schedule for buying. You <i>can</i> turn that around, however, with, ""If I can get this for $X, I will buy right now."" Salesguys really believe in ""bird in hand is worth two in the bush"", and will do a lot to get you to hand over your money right now.<p>- Know what you're buying and what you want to pay for it. Knowledge is the most valuable thing you have in a negotiation. Keep as much of the advantage on knowledge as possible to yourself. If you know you can't order online because you need an item <i>right now</i>, never say that to the sales person. As far as they are concerned, you might buy today, or you might buy next month (until you need to use the ""I will buy today at X price"" gambit), or you might not buy at all. Corollary to that, however, is the fact that good sales guys can smell money and a willingness to spend it. They may not take you seriously, if they think you're just being a lookie-loo, and won't give you their best price without the hope of getting your money today. Don't feel bad about the knowledge advantages you have...they have more such advantages on their side. They know the wholesale price, all available offers, whether it will be on sale on the weekend, etc.",1259108993

To make this work, the action of the Map function needs to be immutable with respect to the record; this is intellectually pleasing but incredibly annoying in practice.<p>I haven't really used the Map/Reduce functionality of Mongo yet, but I have poked at it a little. Basically, with MongoDB, you do a one-time transform from one ""collection"" of records to another.

6558660,comment,6556034,6557088,1,0,emillon,,,"I think that the commit history says a lot about the development process and the company culture. First, is that it&#x27;s interesting to see how these companies work internally. Second, it&#x27;s easier to dive into the code by reading the latest commits. You can see what&#x27;s going on and what pieces are changed together. Finally, there is a substantial difference between:<p>- a repository that&#x27;s handled as a first class &quot;source code ledger&quot; (pick one or several of: proper branching/merging, atomic commits, issues referenced in commit messages, etc).<p>- a repository full of &quot;git commit -a -m &#x27;ill fix this bug later, TGIF&#x27;&quot; whose history makes no sense.<p>I don&#x27;t want to open the debate on which one is preferable or not (most people agree that git bisect is handy, but it is open to debate whether it&#x27;s worth the cost).<p>What I&#x27;m wondering is how it looked and why it was rewritten. The most probable reason is that they wanted to make sure that nothing sensitive was exposed (non-redistributable embedded dependencies, information on their infrastructure, ...). But it&#x27;s also possible that this was started as a type-2 repository and they don&#x27;t want to expose this image.<p>I tend to think that every code should be written (and developed) as it was open sourced one day, but as always there&#x27;s a cost trade-off in here.<p>Anyway, thanks for open sourcing this piece of software!",1381913942

The minimal explanation IMHO would be:<p>Every solid has a vibration propation speed, or &quot;speed of sound&quot;. The more compressible, the lower the speed. Slinkies are very compressible.<p>When the slinky is released, the bottom has nothing to hold it up anymore. <i>However</i> (the key part), the affect is delayed by how the &quot;signal&quot; of the lost support can only travel at the (very low) speed of sound in the slinky.<p>If/when the object is a lot stiffer (say, a broomstick), the bottom &quot;learns&quot; of the loss of support a lot faster and you couldn&#x27;t so easily perceive the lag between dropping and the start if the bottom&#x27;s fall. Plus, the % length contraction is a lot smaller for a broomstick than a slinky.<p>If you had supported it only from the bottom, there would likewise be a delay in the signal reaching the top, although the slinky would already be closed and no longer have the compressibility of when it has room to contract further.<p>Even shorter: it&#x27;s all about signal propagation and the slinky permits a really slow speed of it.",1381913004

You no longer have to create and manage multiple distributions or domain names in order to accept POST or PUT requests.</i><p><i>Second, your users can now benefit from accelerated content uploads. After you enable the additional HTTP methods for your application&#x27;s distribution, PUT and POST operations will be sent to the origin (e.g. Amazon S3) via the CloudFront edge location, improving efficiency, reducing latency, and allowing the application to benefit from the monitored, persistent connections that CloudFront maintains from the edge locations to the origin servers.</i><p>So you get to save on having to configure and serve multiple domain names (which isn&#x27;t all that hard), but you have to add logic to your server side code and user exposed uploading UX to check and display to the user if content is finished being uploaded by the user to cloudfront and by cloudfront to the origin/backing store before using/processing/displaying it.",1381910401

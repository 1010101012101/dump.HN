To group them all together is really untrue else &quot;crimes of opportunity&quot; wouldn&#x27;t be a thing.. I&#x27;ve seen cases of some really dumb and obviously unplanned burglaries - including the time my own house was burglarized. I&#x27;ve seen even dumber petty thefts - those that were impulsive, indiscriminate, opportunistic to a T.  Example: a friend of mine had a bottle of Gatorade stolen from her car but the robber left the cash in the (unlocked) glove compartment.",1434650389

Heck, you don&#x27;t even know if s/he is over-teasing, something you call a fact.<p>Your opinion about that teasing should be left in childhood is just that, an opinion, and one that actually contradicts your earlier statement that there is a healthy amount of teasing.<p>I think I understand your point - some people excuse bad behavior with claims that they are &quot;only teasing&quot;.  That&#x27;s valid criticism, but we need to address the specific behavior, though, not a whole method of interaction that can be used in a healthy way in adulthood.<p>If this behavior is the biggest issue two parents have between them then they need to have a discussion.  Contrary to your comments, though, it&#x27;s not clear that the teasing and challenging needs to decrease.  It could be that they do, or they need to be done in a different way, or in an way that doesn&#x27;t make the other parent uncomfortable, or many other solutions.<p>Like most internet discussions, we just don&#x27;t have enough information to be sure.",1434650349

I&#x27;ve got a piece of software that lets me A/B these candidates resumes & profiles side-by-side so I rank-sort them quickly.  And all &quot;interviews&quot; are small-boxed projects that I ACTUALLY PAY FOR THE WORK.<p>See, most interviews are along the lines of:
Q: Are you smart and good looking?
A: Yes!<p>This is why I don&#x27;t really intervew all.  When I take the &quot;best&quot; ranked applicants I give them actual work; small slices from our actual code base.  I provide them a complete, functional dev environment with one restrciton: cannot commit to git.  I can see their work directly, I work with them directly and get real-time data on what it&#x27;s like to work with them, how they handle a project, how they communicate blockages, how they figure out our existing systems.<p>In four to eight hours of work I know who is the right fit for our team.  My cost to find and filter is very very low and rather than waste 2-4 hours per interview for 10 candidates I pay for 16-24 hours of work for 2 or 3 candidates.  The hard costs are the same, it consumes less of my (or my engineers) time and the candidate fit is very good.",1434650318

It&#x27;s 100% the prudent financial move.<p>However there is a bit of a problem with market forces in this regard. No (or little) money down mortgages have become almost the norm. The average homeowner puts <i>significantly</i> less than 20% down. This inflates home prices for several reasons:<p>1) People can buy more expensive homes on less money, allowing land owners to increase prices<p>2) Mortgage rates/plans are now structured to cover for the higher risk quotient (even if you do the usual 20% down you&#x27;re still paying for the idiot who bought a million dollar home with nothing down)<p>3) Potential first time owners are forced to buy less for their money, further inflating that specific market which has huge ripple effects into the more mature sectors (first time home owners are far more likely to sell their current home and now there is additional financial pressure to make a profit, etc. etc.)<p>4) People, wisely or unwisely, exploit these new conditions to &quot;play&quot; the real estate game<p>5) The market becomes less sane the larger/more expensive the home, as the higher prices (even normally) encourage people to put less down<p>And guess what... all of this just makes it harder to put 20% down on a home, further exacerbating the cycle. Especially when you&#x27;re in a bidding war and someone is willing to outbid you because they&#x27;re putting less money down (which is a terrible financial move, but one that happens all too frequently). Bidding wars are low key one of the biggest reasons people go into housing debt, they get caught up in a specific house and aren&#x27;t willing to walk away regardless of how the finances have changed since they first looked.<p>There&#x27;s a lot of economic intertwining here with QE, general interest rates, and the economy at large so I&#x27;m not going to profess to know what&#x27;s really going on here, but the housing market is very close to &quot;utterly f*@#ed&quot; for the middle class with no foreseeable recovery. And that&#x27;s not even getting into the pandora&#x27;s box of how the new exploding rental market is also skewing the market heavily.<p>Quick thought experiment: How many people that are buying at 100k do you think have 20k in the bank? Now how many of those do you think have 20k to drop on a down payment? Now look at what 100k gets you in a modern metro area and cry yourself to sleep.",1434649978

Even if you&#x27;re not really looking right now, why not interview at a few places just to work on your chops?  You could also role-play interviews with friends, family and co-workers.  It may not remove the anxiety, but exposing yourself to the process a little more could really help.<p>I&#x27;ve had some issues with the whiteboard in the past.  After I blew one interview (partially based on my whiteboard performance), I spent a lot of time coding solutions with a pen and paper, working on my penmanship (so that I could read my own writing) and just getting used to solving problems away from a screen.  It really helped me get over a lot of my issues with that particular situation.",1434649784

I respectfully suggest that the valuation of a company is <i>intended</i> to represent the discounted summation of future cashflow, and in a highly competitive marketplace that valuation is <i>intended</i> to reach the summation of those market place participants who estimate the cash flows to be the highest (without presumably deliberately intending a loss to themselves)<p>I cannot see any other way to price it (well lots of ways to estimate future cashflow and even define cashflow) but there is not some agreed amount of discount for risk out there.  Yes people will always want such a discount, and can walk away.  But the discount does not start with a figure and work downwards.  It&#x27;s only a discount in hindsight as it were.<p>Imagine if you will a hotel in NY that has one room, 100 USD per night and is going to be knocked down in 100 days time.  I would only expect to pay a maximum of 10000 USD to buy the hotel.  Any more would be obviously foolish.  Present value plays some part but mostly estimated occupancy drives the expected cashflow.<p>But also if I demanded a discount for the risk that the hotel might not pay back my investment, there is likely to be some other investor who has a different view on the Hotel scene in NY.  Especially for the &quot;ultimate in boutique experiences&quot;.  No one will pay more than 10,000 but how close we come is (should be?) determined entirely by investors estimates.<p>I do not think that the main driver of valuation is that between VCs and the founders.  That is admin work.  The driver of the price paid by a VC is how much other VCs are willing to pay instead.<p>That seems a good thing to me.<p>Thank you for the comments - good to think these through.",1434649375

9740350,comment,9736794,9736794,0,0,j2kun,,,"Explanation for non-PhD&#x27;s (my qualifications: I do some quantum research, and the other day I was at Aaron&#x27;s talk he refers to, and briefly talked to him afterward).<p>The overarching problem is whether we can prove that quantum algorithms are exponentially faster than classical algorithms. We believe it&#x27;s true for things like factoring or discrete log (maybe), but these are conjectural because proving lower bounds for general classical algorithms is really really hard.<p>One the other hand, there are other problem models in which we can prove quantum algorithms are much faster than classical algorithms. These generally take the form of a &quot;black-box query&quot; model. Here is one example: there is a hidden boolean function f(x), and you get the promise that it has one of two properties (which are mutually exclusive). You get to query inputs x and receive outputs f(x), and you want to determine which of the two properties it has. The simplest example of such a problem is determining whether a function is contstant or is 0 on exactly half of the inputs and 1 on the other half. Classically you have to query 2^(n-1) + 1 inputs in the worst case. If you&#x27;re allowed to give queries which are quantum superpositions of some inputs, then you can actually do it with one query. [1]<p>The model studied by Aaronson and Ambainis et al. is a slightly different kind of black box model, but with a similar flavor. You know f and you get query access to the bits of an unknown input x. You want to compute f(x) with as few queries as possible. Clearly you can do it with N queries where x has N bits, but some quantum algorithms can do it in 1 query by making a quantum query. In that model the goal is still to show the biggest gap in the number of needed queries between quantum algorithms and classical algorithms (possibly with randomness). Also people are interested in the difference between classical algorithms with randomness and without randomness, and in addition to proving the biggest quantum/classical gap, Amabainis et al refute a major conjecture about the biggest possible randomized/determinstic classical gap.<p>[1]: <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deutsch%E2%80%93Jozsa_algorithm"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deutsch%E2%80%93Jozsa_algorith...</a>",1434649180

How many times do you need to peek at a bit in the array before you can classify it into the 3/4-true or 3/4-false categories?<p>- If you use a deterministic peeking strategy, you need to check at least 1/2 of the input. If you don&#x27;t, you&#x27;re guaranteed to fail on some inputs.<p>- If you use a randomized peeking strategy, then you can avoid having &quot;bad&quot; inputs and become pretty sure of the answer after only a constant number of randomly sampled peeks. But if you want to be <i>certain</i>, then you&#x27;ll still need to sample at least 1/2 of the input.<p>- If you&#x27;re allowed to use a quantum peeking strategy, then you can solve the problem with certainty with a single superposed peek by applying one iteration of Grover&#x27;s algorithm [1].<p>That&#x27;s an example of a query separation. Quantumly, we can solve a problem with certainty in Θ(1) queries where classically we needed Θ(n) queries.

A variant of the example I gave that is total is a function that classifies inputs as at-least-3/4-true vs less-than-3/4-true.

Is there some other problem, where the total separation is larger? Yes.

They would round out and wax and wane about &#x27;terrorist material&#x27; - content such as the ISIL newsletter (which overall is not &#x27;gross&#x27;, especially compared to some American cinema). But blocked content is broader than that.<p>Facebook is also part of a network of other American Social Media companies that have automated systems to block content posted that match certain patterns and known propaganda efforts by other nations.<p>Recently an anti-TPP website was blocked simultaneously across several communication providers (<a href=""https://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/38pmg8/hey_reddit_someone_is_trying_really_hard_to_erase/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/38pmg8/hey_redd...</a>). This was a mistake as the website name closely matched the name of a Russian Anti-TPP propaganda campaign.<p>The mere existence of the ability to coordinate content blocking across service providers means that a censorship network exists - the question becomes whether it is &#x27;abused&#x27;.<p>It&#x27;s difficult to ascertain abuse, of course, given the Obama Administrations policy with regard to censorship and propaganda and its weakening of the Smith-Mundt Anti-Propaganda Act. The Administration believes that the US government is not responsible for having its influence operations online spill over to affect American people - it is merely prohibited from actively and specifically targeting Americans. That is, the new policy is that it&#x27;s okay - even expected - for Americans to be &#x27;collateral damage&#x27; in censorship and propaganda campaigns.<p>Thinkers like Cass Sunstein are traded high up in the US Government - Sunstein wrote a book on the &#x27;Problem of Free Speech&#x27;. Broadly this influential Washington Legal Scholar believes that speech that is actively harmful or misinformed can and should be &#x27;addressed&#x27; by the state - and he recommends ways in which that can happen.<p>The Snowden documents reveal that (so far as we know non-specific American targeting) the mass surveillance networks are intrinsically tied to influence operation capabilities - outside those capabilities at the GCHQ (which legally are not prevented from targeting Americans) - and who engage quite heavily in psychological influence campaigns.<p>I have personally, repeatedly witnessed Facebook selectively block posts of mine linking Wikileaks material, the Snowden documents (when they were first being published), and leaked drafts of the Trans Pacific Partnership and watched as others complained about having their posts trying to organize protests on May Day blocked similarly.<p>It&#x27;s true also that Facebook has been associated with at least two studies on societal manipulation programs with researchers that are funded by the Department of Defense in the same area. Many people remember the &quot;Emotion Manipulation Study&quot; - fewer the vote influence study. These sorts of programs have been called for in the past 10 years of Defense Document planning and DARPA today, under their SMISC program, study similarly how to shape and track ideas in social media networks like Twitter.<p>I&#x27;m honestly glad that the EFF is finally giving this issue some attention.",1434648771

It costed 1500 levas which were a lot of money back then.<p>Now there was no official software, books, etc. to be found in Bulgaria. There were some really good books though, and 1 or 2 magazines that were putting ONE-LINE basic programms, or HEX codes for the Apple][ or Oric clones (called Pravetz 8D)<p>With a friend of mine (who had the 8D version, e.g. the Oric clone, not Apple) we spent a lot of time entering these codes and then comparing the machines. His &quot;Oric&quot; was pluggable into TV set, had better colors, and used tape. Mine had floppy, more memory, but greenish monitor (no colors), although high-res (Apple ][c had the 580x192 back then).<p>He had timers, interrupts, multiple keys at the same time, I did not had those :)<p>I did my first hack, out of being bored to make the live in the Gemstone Warrior game never end. There was this TSR application (TSR=terminate and stay resident) on the PC (MS-DOS) with which you can save the full memory of your computer. So if you play a game, you would save the memory before you die, then save after you die. You do this several times. Most of the memory would be untouched, so you would be looking where the bytes would decrease (some PC games actually used BIC encoding, e.g. integers kept as strings). But once I&#x27;ve got the idea, I&#x27;ve did some hacks to interrupt the Apple ][ Gemstone Warrior game, write back to the floppy the contents, and then spent days writing code to find the diffs. At the end I had to look at so much assembly, that by accident I&#x27;ve found how to make infinite lifes in the game.<p>So a lot of CALL-151, but never learned 6502 assembly that well. I was amazed when a friend of ours showed us a sprite demo where he could draw the sprites on the edges of the screen (!!!!) and displayed on every pixel on the screen (not aligned on 7). That was bananas! Also his demo did not had any flickering, and all coded in assembly.... I had to stay in BASIC land for a while, eventually made an text-editor that was mimicking the E3 editor found on the PC - with scrolling left-right. It was written in BASIC and took most of the memory, leaving almost nothing for the actual text :) - but hey it was fun.<p>There was this strange person though, he wrote a whole BASIC app - about 15-20kb full of LINE code (HGR, HGR2 modes) drawing Michael Jackson (okay, no Take 2, Paint shop - it was Michael Jackson drawn by code line by line).<p>Year later we started getting tons of &quot;illegal&quot; (as there was nothing else) software and enjoying lots of other games.<p>One day my floppy died. Months earlier my friend with the Oric had bought an external floppy, but it died also, so he found a way to seek from the begining of the head to the end and control it with the shift keys, then he assigned letters to correspond to different seek, and it sounded a bit like piano.<p>I did the same on my floppy when it was no good for anything else, but wasn&#x27;t as cool - no shifts, just rumbling.<p>Ah, sector 11, or was it track 11...

Storing rainwater (underground, with very little evaporation) is much more energy efficient than desalination. Could this alone fix all the problems of water supply even just for cities? Maybe not, but what it can do, it can do very efficiently. Even if it&#x27;s not at all cheap and easy: I didn&#x27;t run the numbers, but I&#x27;m pretty sure that building that kind of distributed storage capacity is much more expensive upfront than building an &quot;equivalent&quot; desalination plant. The difference is that the desalination plant will burn energy forever, while the water storage will use much, much, much less. Even if the historical average were say half the 14 inches quoted in the article, you would &quot;just&quot; need to cover a bigger catchment area.<p>2. We don&#x27;t have infinite resources, and we can only build so much electrical power capacity from solar every year. As long as most of the electrical power generation emits CO2 (and worse), the more electrical power you use for desalination, the more CO2 you&#x27;re going to emit.",1434648618

But aside from the financial aspect, it&#x27;s hard to overstate the extent to which renters get treated like second class citizens.<p>When a housing situation goes south and your only recourse is to uproot and move, you&#x27;re not exactly in an advantageous situation. I had the misfortune of renting from someone who more or less turned out to be a slumlord and whom I had to take to court to get my deposit back from after deciding to leave. The tenant laws were luckily very clear. A landlord needed to prove the condition of the property is what they said it was before and after, which in my case they couldn&#x27;t since the damages they claimed were fabricated. But to my surprise, the judge, when considering the he-said-she-said nature of the dispute, ruled in favor of the landlord &quot;by default&quot;, as she said, even though the law is very clear on where the burden of proof lies. I could have appealed, but by that point I had moved out of state so it wasn&#x27;t worth the hassle.<p>When I eventually did buy a home, the lender required a letter from all of my previous landlords stating that I was a tenant in good standing, even from the slumlord, who I can assure you was not interested in doing me any favors. No amount of discussion with the lender could move them on this point, and it looked as if I was not going to be able to get the house. The situation was saved when, at the 11th hour, I quietly received the needed letter from the slumlord&#x27;s wife, who was apparently more sympathetic.<p>The idea that the absence of personal letter from an indifferent slumlord could prevent me from buying property was insane, and the entire ordeal, including the court judgement, highlights the extent to which property owners are held in higher regard than renters, as the judge said, &quot;by default&quot;.

The point of my excitement for godebug resides in the fact that it&#x27;s an easy to work with, zero complexity added tool to replace most tedious println() debugging sessions. That is, the non-exciting stuff.<p>Not all bugs only happen on production load, architecture, etc. Many times (with DNS servers even more so, I&#x27;d say) bugs are simple state or logic bugs. The Heisenbugs exist. The complex resource-constrained races exist. And I find it fun to track them down, but many bugs are much more mundane, and godebug is a great tool for catching those.<p>Speaking instead about hard to trace production bugs, I think the Go design and library deserve their daily share of praise here, since they solve many of those problems. Take Valgrind (or ASAN). Amazing tools. Completely useless in Go -- the language is memory-safe and will make that kind of bugs both hard to introduce and immediately detectable.<p>And about concurrency, first of all the simple design makes bugs harder to introduce and easier to reason about. But even when they make their way in I find provisions like net/http/pprof and its various profile a pleasure to work with. And finally there&#x27;s obviously the race detector.<p>Still, I can&#x27;t wait to see more tools developed to cover different Go debugging needs.

Client-facing workday goes roughly 9am-6pm. Preparation workday goes from 6pm to anything from midnight (on a good day) to 5am (on a bad day).<p>During the client-facing workday you&#x27;re spending about 1-2 total hours having meetings with clients, usually on conference calls, occasionally in person; the more senior you are, the more personal interaction you have with clients. The remainder of the time is spent reviewing the materials you generated the previous night, talking about what needs to be done, etc -- basically a constant planning / execution workflow around multiple concurrent streams of deliverables.<p>In the evening, managing directors go home around 6pm and vice presidents go home around 8pm. That&#x27;s when you become really &quot;free&quot; to hunker down and start jamming out work. It&#x27;s a lot harder to be productive when your time is hacked into 30-minute chunks the way it is during the client-facing day.<p>It is quite common to have nothing to do for hours at a time, both during the day and evening, while you wait for people to get back to you with further instructions on what to prepare and/or instructions for changing what you&#x27;ve already made. So, a 16-hour workday isn&#x27;t usually a full 16 hours straight. You usually have time to go to the very nice on-site gym, for example.<p>The deliverables you&#x27;re making are usually PowerPoint presentations with a lot of model-driven Excel outputs in them. Occasionally the underlying models are intellectually interesting, but they usually are pretty monotonous to put together....you&#x27;re building something to a clear spec, and the challenge is being 100.000% certain you did it without errors, not figuring out how to do it.<p>To answer the question about whether you&#x27;re productive working such long hours: the time commitment and the stress certainly don&#x27;t foster creativity, happiness, or high productivity, but they really don&#x27;t need you to be doing inspired work. At a junior level they&#x27;re looking for people who can follow defined processes at a high level of throughput with a low error rate, while contributing occasional flashes of original thought -- for example, when you have to build a new model based on a unique client situation. Those situations are actually really exciting (especially when you&#x27;re working on a big problem for a big client) but the flipside of the excitement is the stress around the consequences of fucking it up -- e.g., if the client just got a &quot;bear hug&quot; letter from a competitor expressing interest in a merger and you have to model out whether it makes financial sense.<p>The downside is that it&#x27;s a miserable and unhealthy way to spend a couple of years. The upside is that you ride an incredibly steep learning curve and gain a ton of knowledge on valuation models, the inner workings of various industries, corporate governance, and how to run merger / fundraising / hostile-defense processes.<p>Hope this was helpful.",1434647845

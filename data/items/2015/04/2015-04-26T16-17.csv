The researchers ran ten Facebook advertising campaigns, and when they analyzed the likes resulting from those campaigns, they found that 1,867 of the 2,767 likes—or about 67 percent—appeared to be illegitimate. After being informed of these suspicions, Facebook corroborated much of the team’s work by erasing 1,730 of the likes. Sympathetic researchers from a study run by the online marketing website Search Engine Journal have suggested that targeted Facebook advertisements can yield suspicious likes at a rate above 50 percent. In the fall of 2014, Professor Emiliano De Cristofaro of the University College of London presented research which found that even a page explicitly labeled as fake gained followers—the vast majority presumably bots.<p>> The bot buildup can even affect companies that aren’t advertising with Facebook, but are just passively hoping their pages gain real fans. In 2014, Harvard University’s Facebook fans were most engaged in Dhaka, Bangladesh. (They stated that they did not pay for likes.) A 2012 article in The New York Times suggested that as much as 70 percent of President Obama’s 19 million Twitter followers were fake. (His campaign denied buying followers.) Less prominent pages from across the world—from those belonging to the English metal band Red Seas Fire to international bloggers—have been spontaneously overwhelmed by bots that are attempting to mask their illicit activity by glomming on to real social media profiles.",1430067432

I configured the kernel by hand, checked the USE flags of all packages, looked up what each option was for and recompiled a shitload of things when I made a mistake.

Eventually, I found that it just took up too much of my time to do so.<p>Arch is still a rather flexible system but it hides some of this low level stuff from the user.

9442341,comment,9441465,9441465,0,0,notacoward,,,"There&#x27;s no one answer.  Instead, it&#x27;s a combination of factors that others have touched upon - closeness or influence relative to the decision makers, &quot;force multiplier&quot; effect, good old supply and demand.  Instead of reiterating the point, I&#x27;m just going to get right in the face of the commenters who think it&#x27;s unjust that managers tend to make more.  I&#x27;m just a developer myself, I&#x27;ve never been a manager, but come on, let&#x27;s not be total a-holes about this.<p>(1) It&#x27;s just wrong to measure managers by the same yardstick one would use for individual contributors.  Of course people who perceive themselves as the most technically proficient believe that less technically proficient managers should make less, but there&#x27;s no rational business case for awarding pay on that basis.  What managers do and understand might not be as technical, but that doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;s less important for the bottom line.<p>(2) You&#x27;re probably wrong about the technical-profiency thing anyway.  Sure, managers might not understand your favorite two-year-old technology as well as you do, but it&#x27;s highly likely that they know some other still-relevant technologies better than you and have a better &quot;gut feel&quot; for technology overall.<p>(3) Business sense and general technical judgement are harder to hire for than narrow momentarily-relevant skills.  Also, what managers do is often a lot less fun than what developers do.  Who wants to spend all day every day in meetings or dealing with budget/personnel issues or balancing long-term development with the fire drill of the day?  Thus, even if what managers know were less <i>intrinsically</i> valuable than what developers do, the demand for good managers would still drive up pay.<p>To flip this on its head, think for a moment about what the world would have to be like in order for managers <i>not</i> to make more (in general - I know there are already plentiful exceptions).  Then you <i>would</i> have less technically able managers, making worse decisions, not resolving interpersonal issues, pushing more work onto the team or onto HR.  Whee.  What fun.  Instead of grousing about it, accept it as the way as the world and get on with getting ahead yourself.",1430067022

Why are you put in such a situation, possibly in the role of a whistleblower? Is there something greater that is screaming to be done regardless of how you will personally survive? Don&#x27;t literally think but take some time to listen to something inside of you.

I&#x27;m not a US citizen but if there&#x27;s something done not according to the Federal law I could imagine some Federal authority might be very interested in it.<p>Start looking for a position elsewhere. Consider your job done: don&#x27;t look back. You can do that later when you&#x27;re safe in another job but now is not the time. You can take a &quot;lesser job&quot; because you can explain it away as being fired because of not tolerating unlawful practices. At least you have your feet on solid ground again.<p>Then escalate the matter to your manager&#x27;s boss or his boss. There should be someone in the company (or someone who&#x27;s invested in the company) who&#x27;s interested in unlawful compliance documents.

This claim is nothing special, as in fact almost all tests are eventually done on an aliquot no larger than a few microlitres that is withdrawn from the larger sample. As to speed of results, this would likely be linked to organizational efficiency rather than a technical innovation.<p>Further, there is no way all the tests shown on their website can be done with one 0.5 ml sample, as samples need to be collected into different anti-coagulants for different tests as some anticoagulants interfere with some tests but not other (this is why the doctor usually takes two or three samples into different tubes -- not because s/he needs 30 ml of blood).<p>They may however have improved automation, or a better run or cheaper service, in which case, good for them.",1430066755

Doesn&#x27;t matter who is right or wrong. I have seen this so many times in my 11 years of professional experience that I will say this with conviction.<p>Now, if you are really sure that your manager is preparing to fire you, then :<p>&quot;Do I simply begin looking for other positions&quot;<p>Yes, right away. Keep it only to yourself.<p>&quot;Do I report his increasingly erratic behavior, and waste of firm resources?&quot;<p>Don&#x27;t. At least not yet. It will be a waste of your time and until you are in a strong position (have already found another job etc), you will most likely weaken your position further. Remember, the company will have more interest in keeping the manager and not you. This is not the time to be a whistleblower etc and think about doing the right thing etc. The right thing to do is to look out for yourself by finding another job asap. All the other things can come later if you want.<p>&quot;Do I quit before the period expires?&quot;<p>Find a job if you can within the period and quit then. Do not quit on your own before finding another job.<p>Here is my overall take on this. You need to put yourself in a strong position before doing anything. This means that you have another job lined up. Don&#x27;t worry about being blacklisted because if you do need a reference, you can always use other colleagues and not necessarily your manager. Remember the saying &quot;most people quit their bosses not the company&quot;. And if you can find the new job before getting fired/quitting, then you anyway don&#x27;t have to use current boss/company as reference because no one does that. You also will not have to explain the details of why you are really quitting.<p>Even though you cannot say with certainty, but whenever a manager puts someone on a &quot;30 day review&quot;, it is most likely because they want to get rid of you. Officially, they have to do a bunch of bullshit documentation for HR and legal purposes but your hunch is almost always right.<p>Get out of there if you feel like you are no longer wanted. Do not confront your boss or say anything verbally or in writing. Keep it simple. Find a job, give notice to your current employer/boss in writing which should just say &quot;I am quitting effective xyz date&quot;. Be prepared to be fired right away on the spot after your notice if they were anyway going to get rid of you. SO before sending the notice, make sure you have your desk ready to go just in case. I have seen this many times when someone is walked out of their office right away after giving notice when they were anyway going to be fired.",1430065067

These are the slides for my talk, which includes some of the code examples that we walked through: <a href=""https://chimeracoder.github.io/docker-without-docker/#1"" rel=""nofollow"">https://chimeracoder.github.io/docker-without-docker/#1</a><p>Consider Git. Git exists solely on the filesystem. If you want, you can read git repos by inflating the ZLIB-compressed objects yourself, and create git repos by compressing objects, hashing them, and storing them in right locations the exact same way that Git does.<p>It&#x27;s a lot of work, and the Git toolchain exists so you don&#x27;t have to type insanely long bash one-liners just to read your commit history. But it&#x27;s kind of cool to know that >95% of Git is really just &#x27;syntactic sugar&#x27; around functionality that&#x27;s also provided by other command-line tools[0].<p>I&#x27;ll wave my hands a bit, but in short: containerization uses features implemented at the kernel level, and in fact, until recently, Docker and systemd both built on top of LXC (Docker has switched created their own libcontainer).<p>If you take a running Docker container and dump it, you&#x27;ll get a root filesystem. You could chroot(8) inside this root filesystem, but as we know, containerization is more powerful than chroot. Once you&#x27;ve dumped the container, systemd doesn&#x27;t need to know that it was once a Docker container - it&#x27;ll just look for whatever binary is located at /sbin/init and run that (or run whatever command you tell it to run instead. Just like your actual OS - which is not a coincidence!).<p>One advantage to using systemd instead of the Docker daemon/runtime is that systemd is capable of running itself inside a container, whereas running init systems inside Docker containers is tricky and not recommended[1]. Futhermore, systemd is smart enough to know when it&#x27;s running inside a container and when it&#x27;s not, so the container init system plays nicely with the host init system - things like integrated system logs and networking.<p>Newer versions of systemd actually allow you to <i>pull</i> Docker images from the Docker hub directly, so you can even use systemd to replace `docker pull` as well as `docker run`.<p>[0] There&#x27;s a tiny, tiny portion of Git which is home-grown, but most of the features it builds on (SHA, zlib, diff) are easily replaced by other command-line tools.<p>[1] While it&#x27;s supported, the primary use case of Docker is for running application processes: <a href=""https://github.com/docker/docker/issues/2170"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/docker/docker/issues/2170</a>",1430064207

He references the roundly debunked &quot;Patent Trolls cost X trillion dollars&quot; study and accepts it as fact.<p>2. He calls ED Texas &quot;plaintiff friendly&quot;, which it hasn&#x27;t been for a while (<a href=""http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1597919"" rel=""nofollow"">http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1597919</a>) - these days it&#x27;s popular because of other factors.<p>3.

Which, BTW, had journalism worse than this clip. M-CAM is a laughingstock of the IP licensing world as they appear to have no idea how patents really work.<p>4. The whole &quot;trial lawyers killed patent reform&quot; thing is a red herring if you just stop a second to think about it. As Oliver himself says a few minutes earlier, the whole patent troll business model is <i>avoiding</i> trials by settling for less than the cost of a lawsuit. In fact 97% of patent lawsuits, patent troll or otherwise, settle without trial. Statistically, trial lawyers have very little skin in the game. I don&#x27;t know what really killed this patent reform bill (my guess is the pharma lobby), but I&#x27;m really curious why people decided to blame the trial lawyers.",1430064201

Intel will lag behind a year or two after that. Microsoft will be behind another year or two.<p>So, let&#x27;s say that C++17 does come out in 2017. It will probably be the case that some of the features will be ready to use in GCC and Clang right away, and around 2019 or so they should have full or nearly full support. 2021 for Intel. 2023 for Microsoft.<p>So that gives you a range of answers. Depending on which features and which compiler, you could start using some of them immediately (or even before 2017, many of the features are implemented experimentally in advance), but if you want full support across the range of commonly used compilers, you&#x27;re probably going to be waiting until the early to mid 2020s.",1430064080

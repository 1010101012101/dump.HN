664710,comment,664621,664701,0,0,davidw,,,"Bingo!  I would peg the gold rush as the real beginning of ""the California mentality"".  It's interesting to compare and contrast California with Oregon, where I'm from.  Oregon was settled by boring farmer types who set about creating schools and churches and gave dull names to everything[1].  That mentality is still there... people lead good, and often quiet, happy, modest, productive, lives, but there is nothing like the ""big bet"" startup mentality in the bay area.  Even Portland, which has lots of bright tech folks, and isn't <i>that</i> far away from the bay area (flights are plentiful and relatively short) doesn't strike me as having much of a startup scene.  And where I'm from, in Eugene... it always seemed to me that no one did much of anything outside of protesting for the cause du jour, despite having a reasonably large, and reasonably good university.  Perhaps not in terms of companies/startups, but people are far more ""doers"" here in Padova than there, to say nothing of the bay area.<p>[1] I would love to do research/find articles on surveys of place names.  For instance, the Willamette valley is full of boring biblical/someone's daughter/back home names, but once you get to mining country in southern Oregon, you get more names like ""Jumpoff Joe Creek"" (look for it driving on I-5 north of Grants Pass).  Even the geographical terms change: there are no 'gulches' around Eugene, but plenty in southern Oregon.  I wonder about the significance of that.",1245391080

There is international competition, but unlike Detroit we will import workers, outsource activity, and lower wages if necessary to adapt.",1245391038
664708,comment,663662,664689,0,0,TriinT,,,"The list was supposed to be for ""those who love to learn"". Well, if it's learning one cares about, then anything that is not deep knowledge is suspicious. Truth be told, the OP did not sell his reading list as one for ""those who love to learn"".<p>A book that can be read during a flight cannot be deep. OK, I agree that my choice of words was not the most fortunate, and that ""BS"" and ""junk"" were distasteful... but on the other hand, compared to the monumental works of Feynman and Vladimir Arnold (the kind of books that take years and years to grasp), I can't help thinking that the OP's list pales by comparison. There are books of this time, and there are books of all time. Just like Homer and Marcus Aurelius or Euclid, some great thinkers' words shall be cherished for centuries and centuries to come.<p>As for me, I am a mere mortal. I am not of the caliber required to write such great books, but I would be very happy if I could live long enough to read all the great books I want to read.

And the kind of startups it works for, like Facebook and Twitter, it would work for outside the Valley.<p>It's certainly true that trying to force a startup into the next-big-thing model will generally destroy you.  But the way it destroys you is by failing to get users, and that is not a function of your location.<p>My advice would be simply to use the right model for the kind of startup you have, regardless of where you are.  Make something people want.  If you manage to make something people want so much that it grows explosively, go for it.  But don't assume you will.",1245390830

We would have to go big fast to capture and hold the market before other ""larger"" market players get involved. I've been told two polar opposite things to do by two seasoned entrepreneurs, one says, bootstrap and go a year, the VC's will treat you very well after 50 contracts (should be very easy to get, I have two lined up with only concept and Accenture is interested).  The other says, go west young man, the idea is a market changer and it will go big fast but will needed to be well funded to keep from hitting the cash wall.  That's were I'm torn at the moment.

664683,comment,664621,664679,0,0,rjurney,,,"I don't really disagree with you.  If you have a revolutionary idea in a city like Atlanta, and you are determined to build it without customer contact - you should probably move to Silicon Valley.  As one VC I interviewed in my research, Mike Maples put it, ""Silicon Valley is the place to create 'Thuderlizards,' but you can build a great company anywhere.""<p>Most startups, however, have bad ideas, so keeping them secret doesn't help anyone.  PG has talked about this repeatedly.  Usually your 'Big Idea' turns out to either be total shite, is different enough from what customers want that they won't buy it in its initial form, or the market for your product is not the one you expected.<p>So as a non-attorney, I can't possibly disagree with you.  As an entrepreneur, I know in my GUTS that the key to succeeding here is to get your 'Big Idea' from a customer asking for it.  That doesn't mean you come into the conversation with a blank page - you still start with your initial product vision.  You just iterate until someone is dying to pay you for it.<p>Do it any other way here, and you'll miss most opportunities when the market moves on or someone else with funding does it before you.  The same applies for building a demo without customer contact to get early stage funding - your time is better spent.<p>This is not a place to pursue the kind of idea that you are talking about, unless you can break it down into a minimum viable product people will pay for very quickly.  Fortunately many opportunities are not the kind you describe.",1245388875

But I really like the city, despite its imperfections, and I do hope it can be a base for my own international business one day because if anything Atlanta is very good at being an international hub (UPS, Cocacola, etc.) And with all of these giant companies here in Atlanta, not that I have tried asking, but is it true that there is no cash flow? And why limit yourself to VCs in Atlanta, when I do get more practical about my radical ideas, I plan to email and call as many people as possible, despite their geography.<p>In Israel, where I am from, the local demographic is microscopic. In Israel, almost in exact opposite to the american tradition, successful business men and entrepreneurs are sometimes viewed as frauds/scammers. It's not a good thing to be a business man there like it is here but despite that, look at all the startups, the big tech innovations, the brilliant products that have their roots in Israel because in Israel people don't let their geography, the fact that they are surrounded by enemies limit them.

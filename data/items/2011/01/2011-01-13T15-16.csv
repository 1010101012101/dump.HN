The other guy ran a very successful chain of grocery stores.<p>Now, on one level, selling clothes is just like selling anything else -- groceries, toothpaste, power tools. You have your marketing, your in-store experience, etc. But your grocery store guy will lack the one thing the fashion guy has: namely, an intuitive sense of what makes an otherwise rational consumer spend far too much on some shirt just because it says ""Armani"" on the collar. Your fashion guy knows who his customers are, who they talk to, what they read, and what motivates them to open their wallets. That does not mean the fashion guy will do a better job, but he does have a distinct competitive advantage over the grocery guy.<p>What happens when you don't have a guy like that at the top? Well, Apple nearly tanked after they pushed Steve Jobs out the door in 1986.

However, I've done it for the privacy features of ddg, not because I think google search ""sucks"" more than it used to.<p>Maybe I'm blind. Maybe I don't pay enough attention. Maybe I just use my search engine differently than most (or at least than those who seem to complain a lot lately) but I fail to find a concrete example where google (or ddg for that matter) gives me results that are obviously ""wrong"" (whatever that means).<p>I think we've all learned to speak ""google"". When you query a search engine you don't speak english. You don't ask (or do you?) ""I want articles concerning java on the android platform on the hacker news website"". Instead, you say ""site:news.ycombinator.com android java"". And most of the time I get what I want. Maybe I'm more easily satisfied than most. At any rate, these days it's important to learn this language to effectively use any search engine.<p>In this particular article, the author states that searching for ""iPod Connectivity"" doesn't yield much results that ""actually answer your query"". My question is: as a human being, what kind of results do you expect when you search for ""iphone connectivity""?<p>I'm not playing dumb. Is there one good way to interpret this query? Are you shopping? Are you looking for specs? What kind of connectivity are you looking for anyway?<p>I did the query just now. The third link targets apple.com, the fifth amazon.com. The rest is a bunch of websites doing reviews or selling iphone parts. I can't really judge if those site are legit or not, some do look fishy. But at any rate, why do you say they are ""bad answers""?<p>I do have my gripes with google. Expertexchange used to be a huge pain in the ass, but it's mostly gone these days (probably more thanks to stackoverflow than google, that's for sure). Google has also _never  given me any results on google groups even if it will gladly give me some ad-ridden usenet mirror. I think Google has effectively contributed to destroy usenet that way.<p>It seems people want google to answer queries such as ""What phone should I buy?"" and have google give the <i>right</i> answer in the first link. It seems some people took the church of google a little too literally. The day Google knows how to answer that it will probably follow up by sending a mechanical Schwarzenegger clone back in time to kill bill gates' mother.<p>To sum it up: of course Google may want to fight even more the various adfarms out there, but before you criticize the answer, ask yourself if you've asked the good question.",1294932117

I have always preferred them over Barnes and Noble because they always have a wide selection of technical books.  Unlike B&N which has aisle after aisle of VB, * for Dummies books, and their ilk, Borders is a place where I have discovered great books on niche technical topics.  It will be sad to see them go -- buying a book physically provides  a far greater visceral stultification than buying online.",1294930830

I would prefer we test all drugs on humans as soon as volunteers can be found and the researcher thinks it would be beneficial.<p>I am assuming a volunteer free from political or even financial pressure, doing it out of desire to help. And possessing great and detailed knowledge of the side effects and both the known and potential dangers. I admit this is a bit of a straw man.<p>There are two reasons I want this.<p>1. Political. I am a libertarian and and thus think that if an adult wants to jump off a bridge they should be fully within their right to do that. The same goes if they want to test completely unproven or even fully known to be unsafe drugs.<p>2. Practical. This would speed up research tremendously, it would speed things up by years. We would save more lives.",1294930829

The judgement criterion was the diameter multiplied by the return ratio (how far back up it rebounded).  There was no hard-and-fast definition of a yo-yo.<p>Experimenting with various designs, my buddy and I saw that the biggest challenge was preventing precession, which caused the string to rub against the disks, wasting energy and killing the return ratio.<p>After plying the prof with leading questions about the design requirements, we submitted a yo-yo made with a single disk, cut from a fridge-sized cardboard box.  It had two strings, one running down each side of the disk.  That ended precession nicely.<p>Our entry had both the largest diameter (we had to test it in the stairwell, because the doorframe used to test the other entries wasn't tall enough) and the highest return ratio (in the high-90%).<p>The best part was that, in response to the predictable storm of objections from the other students, the prof turned it into an object lesson.  He made the point that he had never stipulated there had to be one string and two disks, just that there had to be a disk to measure, and a string by which to calculate a return ratio.",1294930812

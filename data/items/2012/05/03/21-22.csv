3925987,story,,,6,6,thesauce25,"Why is there such an emphasis on having a coding founder?",,"Why is there such an emphasis on having a coding founder, especially when applying to incubators? The two most common restrictions I've seen when applying to incubators are:<p>Chances are low if you're applying as a single founder.<p>Chances are low if you're applying as a non-coding founder.<p>I happen to fall into the worst part of that hypothetical Venn diagram. The catch is that the app that I'm working on was selected as a Staff Pick in the Android Market back in January. I'm not saying it's perfect (there's still a ton of work to be done) but it shows that it's possible to have success as a noncoding, single founder.<p>So, why is there such an emphasis on having a coding founder? Since I'm not a coder, I hired a great offshore team to develop the code based on my UI designs, process flows and logic, wireframes, an excel spreadsheet of the algorithms, and database requirements. It's worth noting that I didn't throw piles of money at my team, in fact the first version, the one that was selected as a staff pick, cost me $300 to develop the code. So why is this approach looked down upon by incubators?<p>I implement SAP for a living, and this style of work is done quite often. For example, much of the technical team is offshore while the functional team works onsite. So why are startups penalized for taking this same approach when applying to incubators? I'd argue that the ability to quickly scale your team based on current project scope is a very potent tool, which outweighs the argument that because of the time constraints of an incubator you have to have a code friendly cofounder to churn out code.<p>Just something I've been thinking about, I'm curious to hear what everyone else has to say. Thanks for your time.<p>Just to give reference, the app I built is called Amazing Grocery List, and it's available in the Android Market.",1336081737

3925983,comment,3922490,3925590,1,0,cellularmitosis,,,"Wonderful!  I love the way Zen stories and koans invite so many interpretations.<p>As a casual Zen enthusiast, I have enjoyed two audio books from iTunes, which other newcomers may also enjoy:<p>* Zen Buddhism Stories (Trout Lake Media): This is a reading of many Zen stories similar to the one above about the monk being told to wash his bowl.  Its great for light-heartedly pushing your mind in an unfamiliar direction.  Many of the stories at first lie just outside your understanding, and invite you to ponder them a while longer.  I listened to this audio book several times while driving the Pacific Coast Highway on a Californian road trip, which was a wonderful experience.  Drive, listen, pull over, watch the waves, smell the sea, ponder, repeat.<p>* The Iron Flute: Zen Koans (Nyogen Senzaki): This is a much drier, academic coverage of Zen Koans.  Koans are read and followed by commentary.  Many of these are still very opaque to me (the koans are often a mystery, and the commentary only makes me realize they are even more complex than I had first thought).  More challenging, but still interesting.<p>I've been encouraged by others in my zendo to focus more on practicing Zen (sitting zazen) than reading about Zen, but I must admit, reading about it is great fun :)",1336081709

On the one hand, yes, you probably do not want such a brazen liar leading your company. But on the other hand, we as a society tend to believe in a dangerously inaccurate theory of character. Namely, that people are either inherently moral or they aren't. Liars or truth-tellers. Good or evil.<p>In reality, life isn't so simple. Studies have shown that when people are faced with moral dilemmas, situational factors play a larger role than ""character"". Obviously we all know people who are relatively upstanding. But when it comes down to it, it's not that difficult to put them into a situation where they'll be willing to lie, cheat, or steal. You just need the right combination environmental factors, and they don't even have to be that extreme. It's basic stuff like incentives (which in the CEO world includes million dollar bonuses), chances of getting caught, harshness of punishment, etc.<p>Long-story short, if we really care about improving behavior, we should stop looking for signals of ""trustworthiness"". Instead, we should just assume that everyone is capable of lying, whether they've been caught lying before or not. And we should engineer a system that removes incentives for cheating + makes it more difficult to do so.",1336079080

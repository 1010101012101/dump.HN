You're right that the only thing that ENDS UP mattering is what customers think.  But to use that as an argument against having a co-founder seems strange.<p>Co-founders disagreeing doesn't result in a flip of the coin to see whose opinion they go with.  There's a heartfelt and intelligent discussion.  Logic, experience, and a bit of intuition.  One co-founder might say, ""I know the team over at CompanyX who struggled with the same thing.  They chose Y-- let's see how it worked out for them"".<p>If the OP had a co-founder who was smart about marketing, design, and conversion funnels-- there'd be very few arguments in those areas, but there'd sure as heck be better decisions made being there.<p>In short, I agree with your point but I don't think it applies to this discussion.",1286722727

While I don't remember the articles, we've all seen the ones talking about how demand isn't linear.  Lots of people will try something free that won't try something that costs even a cent.  So, Canonical will pick up the 2 cent tab (the cost of one hour of a Micro instance).  Many will try it.  Heck, if a million people try it, it will cost Canonical $20,000.  That's a lot of exposure for a small amount of money.  Companies are paying way more than 2 cents per click in advertising.  Booting up an instance to try it out is a lot more engagement and investment in the process than an ad click.<p>Canonical is getting smart people to engage with their product for several minutes (if not the whole hour) for a mere 2 cents.  That's one of the best campaigns I've seen and far more effective and cheaper than AdWords for what they're doing.",1286722025

There are significant documented differences between the distributions of intellectual capabilities of genders including the higher variance in IQ for men and men's aptitude skew towards maths and away from language.""<p>Are there?  Cite some for me.  And then explain why they mean there are fewer women in tech but not in other fields.  Higher IQ variance means that there are more super geniuses and more mentally retarded men.  You don't actually need to be a super genius to go into tech.  <i>Maybe</i> to found a startup, though that's also a reach, but certainly not to go be a dev somewhere.  And moreover, why do you assume that those differences are innate?  Maybe they are, but there is also plenty of [uncited] evidence that suggests that many of those differences are learned.<p>I'm not assuming a priori that women are being screwed, but it mystifies me as to why this community tends to assume A) that the tech community is totally immune to societally constructed gender forces that have at some point affected pretty much everything else in the world and B) discrimination is the only bad thing in society that could be keeping women out of tech.<p>""It isn't as if it is a area that has ever been reputed as having a history of institution chauvinism.""<p>…say what now?  Maybe not like law/medicine did, but there's been plenty of chauvinism in tech.<p>""To me, the weight of evidence points more and more towards the differences in distributions of capabilities and preferences between genders playing a significant part in participation rates in tech. However much of an 'Inconvenient Likelihood' this may be for both the tech industry and many women, it shouldn't blind us to evaluating the evidence as objectively as possible.""<p>What evidence?  I'm very happy to evaluate the evidence objectively.  But it seems so far that there's been very little evidence presented either way, and a common response then becomes ""well, I don't see a problem, there must not be one!"", despite the fact that A) this hasn't worked out as an explanation in the past B) there exist several societal factors we could point to that might explain the problem, if we bothered to think about it for two minutes instead of constructing some complicated and totally unfounded explanation based on evolution.<p>Instead of assuming that I'm a crazy and irrational feminist who cannot be convinced by facts, which is not the case, why not respond to the <i>original</i> argument I made, which was that our society conditions women to be afraid, which may explain why they're more risk averse?",1286721421

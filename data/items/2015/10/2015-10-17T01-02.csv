That paper&#x27;s a bit complicated but if you just make the road network with constant voltage drop diodes and resistors instead of constant travel time roads and time-proportional-to-traffic roads respectively, it looks like adding a link actually increases the voltage drop across the overall circuit for a constant current!!",1445047156

10403102,comment,10401950,10402710,0,0,jcranmer,,,"I consider it virtually certain that Pakistani intelligence at some level was specifically hiding bin Laden and probable that the highest levels of government/army either knew or suspected (I personally suspect the latter) that this was the case. Given the instability of the Pakistani state and ISI&#x27;s known prior flirting with extremists, I find it hard to believe that he was sold out by the government. Said information being inadvertently leaked to a low-level, non-ideologically-aligned functionary is possible, but I don&#x27;t know the state of affairs in ISI/Pakistan&#x27;s military well enough to judge its plausibility.<p>As for cooperation: it&#x27;s extremely plausible for anyone who is aware of where bin Laden was hiding to choose to do absolutely nothing (and to try to refrain those who aren&#x27;t aware of that fact to stay the hell away until the dust settles). It&#x27;s reasonable to infer that various people in the military figured out that the US was going after bin Laden sometime during the raid and decided to pretend nothing was going on. Again, given what&#x27;s been known about Pakistan&#x27;s cooperation with terrorists in the past, I&#x27;d be more surprised if the US was open to even limited people in Pakistan about what it was about to do--in a choice between &quot;piss off Pakistan&quot; versus &quot;risk bin Laden getting away,&quot; the former would be my personal vote and probably those of most US politicians.<p>Ultimately, that&#x27;s the problem I have with Hersh&#x27;s version: it assumes that Pakistan suddenly deciding that bedding with terrorists is too risky is a more likely scenario than Pakistan being too incompetent (or merely unwilling) to stand up against the US making the raid it&#x27;s been wanting to make for a decade.",1445047067
10403101,comment,10399688,10400934,0,0,vacri,,,"I had the same problem with puppet (which I ran agentless). One downside to Puppet that Ansible solved for me was no dependency graph. When Puppet breaks, it&#x27;s error messages are sometimes completely uninformative as to why or even where. When Ansible breaks, you know exactly where it broke and usually why.<p>The second downside of Puppet  was that it freaks the hell out and refuse to work if it sees the same command in two different places. If I have two roles and in those roles I&#x27;m installing a single package in the same manner, Puppet throws a wobbly and won&#x27;t run, even if the conf for them is identical. The official answer is &quot;write a module for anything used twice&quot;, but sometimes it&#x27;s just so trivial.<p>In any case, I think Ansible is certainly much better suited to small deployments than (agentless) Puppet.",1445047066

10403093,comment,10399345,10399345,0,0,todd8,,,"After about a month of trying to debug a real-time process control program written in assembler by my boss, I had to resort to desperate measures. The program was about 150 pages long and written in unstructured assembly language. It ran on a minicomputer with the company&#x27;s own operating system. The program controlled a machine full of hydrofluoric acid that etched semiconductor chips on big slices of silicon. It was a real-time program with a few dozen asynchronous parts and couldn&#x27;t be slowed down because of the process machinery that it ran.<p>If it wasn&#x27;t for the other junior programmer assigned to the project, I might have just given up in despair, but the two of us would come in on weekends when the clean room was down and crank up the program and look for problems in its execution.<p>We finally debugged the problems by taking a much larger computer with a fast line printer and used it to do direct memory access to the minicomputer, hex dumping the section of memory containing the bad program&#x27;s data structures as fast as the line printer could print the pages. By calling out to me what was going on with the silicon etch machine I could annotate our core dumps as they printed and we could go back to our desks with the 9 inch thick listing and figure out what was going wrong.<p>Those were the days (1976).",1445046745

One such example is ants, when infected by a type of fungus, will climb high and latch onto a branch by biting hard into it. This is so that the ant will get eaten by birds, which then complete the life cycle of that fungus.<p>There&#x27;s not many well understood systems (the other well-studied one is toxoplasmosis and cats), but one researcher on Experiment, Charissa de Bekker, just released a new paper with findings from her project.<p>The results gave a first clue about the many genes that are involved in this manipulated biting behavior. For instance, that the fungus is likely producing LSD-like compounds and is secreting proteins that could affect serotonin and dopamine levels in the brain, as well as the ant’s ability to communicate through chemosignals with their nest mates. As well, in the paper, they release the entire transcriptome taken from the brains of these ants, giving other scientists a chance to use this as a model system and to begin to target which genes go on to influence behavior.<p>I was just talking to her about it this week, and so this news is very timely and a bit eerie. But very cool.<p><a href=""http://www.biomedcentral.com/content/pdf/s12864-015-1812-x.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.biomedcentral.com/content/pdf/s12864-015-1812-x.p...</a>",1445046721

As such, we need to be careful about resource usage and spikes.<p>Goroutines feel cheap, but if you&#x27;re holding 140k connections, and just 20k of them do something that spins up a goroutine each... you can easily exceed the memory constraint. As such, we had to put goroutine pools in place, careful select statements around them from connections to ensure we didn&#x27;t overwhelm external resources, etc. It was a huge pain. It has been drastically easier to control resource usage with these constraints under python/twisted.<p>YMMV, of course, this is just our experience.

In a commodified market, where all services or products are virtually interchangeable, you either compete on price -- a race to the bottom with ever-declining margins -- or you move upmarket by competing on prestige and perception. Amex&#x27;s prestige hasn&#x27;t fundamentally changed how valuable the card is to hold, but it&#x27;s signed up customers in the first place, and it&#x27;s signed up an affluent segment of customer. (See: the article&#x27;s note about the Amex customer&#x27;s average spend vs. that of other cards.)<p>But brand relies to some degree on information asymmetry. As a consumer, you <i>assume</i> that a prestigious brand is somehow better, and to whatever degree your assumption is based on pure speculation, the stronger you buy into that assumption. These days, information is widely available at a moment&#x27;s lookup. You can compare as never before, across as many scenarios as you like. Interchangeable services, like credit cards, are revealed for what they are. Couple this with the fact that cards are becoming a means to an end, and no longer the physical payment mechanism they once were, and the prestige and mystique of a certain color of plastic fades even faster.<p>These days, the benefits of holding one card over another can be reduced in seconds to a rough mathematical function. How many vendors accept this card? What are the annual fees? What are the interest rates? What is the expected value of the fringe benefits? Amex pioneered the loyalty card (&quot;affinity card,&quot; to use the article&#x27;s parlance) as a means of locking in better fringe benefits. But now everyone&#x27;s got a loyalty card, and partners in the travel and retail sectors have deals with almost everyone.",1445043719

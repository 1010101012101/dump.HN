It started out as something for me, and I'm massaging it into something for everybody.<p>About your botanical garden photos -- I don't expect to compete with flickr for that kind of situation, where several hundred photos are from one event and thus don't really need organizing.  Several hundred photos that could be organized for you by date is the kind of need I address.",1178117649

18707,comment,18706,18706,0,0,immad,,,"Looking into doing some more detailed analytics and I was wondering what methodology people use. <p>I find Google Analytics a bit too limiting and would rather just have the raw data. Was considering just writing to a table, that I clear and analyse overnight (in the appl. controller for the ror's among us), but my business partner is worried that would not scale.<p>Feels like something everyone must come across although I can't find a library for it or a good article on what options the best. Maybe I am overthinking the issue.",1178115781

18704,comment,18654,18654,0,0,Goladus,,,"I don't think Second Life is anywhere near as big as Warcraft, and perhaps not even as big as some other mmogs.  It just got tons of press and positive exposure.  The game seemed to be unusually interesting to journalists, politicians, and other high-profile people.  <p>The most recent estimates I've found put regular users somewhere around 310,000, which does mean it's growing pretty fast but it's also not even in the same league as WoW which had 8.5 million during the same timeframe.  In other words to compare the 6 million figure given by Second Life, it might make more sense to compare box sales.<p><a href=""http://www.informationweek.com/news/showArticle.jhtml?articleID=199203108&subSection=All+Stories"">http://www.informationweek.com/news/showArticle.jhtml?articleID=199203108&subSection=All+Stories</a><p><a href=""http://mmorpgchart.com/"">http://mmorpgchart.com/</a>",1178114963

The owners should pay tax on profits, but why should the corporation itself pay tax?<p>Because a corporation&#x27;s losses cannot harm the owner&#x27;s personal wealth. A corporation therefore should pay taxes in order to cover that particular expense to society.",1410897595

This &quot;embedded systems use microkernels&quot; is easy to paint in such a way that it supports either argument.  Comes down almost to the scottsman falacy.<p>More to the point, if I were to claim that my phone is really running a microkernel, I would be ignoring the majority of the software on my phone.  I mean, yes it is true.  But it is laughable in that the majority of the programming on the device is not in L4.  To a large margin.<p>Consider, you are at this point merely claiming that a state machine in your device is running in a microkernel.  And, to the non-microkernel that runs the majority of the phone, it is but a device.  So, we have a non-microkernel running a microkernel as a standard device.",1410897334
8326728,comment,8324578,8326470,2,0,jude-,,,"Depending on how it&#x27;s implemented, there&#x27;s no real reason why it couldn&#x27;t be done.  For example, I could create SceneGraph_fs, which exposed the scene graph of objects as a directory hierarchy.  The filesystem&#x27;s toplevel directory would be organized with a /scenegraph/ directory for the scenegraph, /lights/ for the light models, and /tmp/ for a scratch space for constructing objects and staging them to be added.  Each node in the scene graph would be represented by a directory under /scenegraph/ which contained one file for each distinct chunk of data the graphics engine would need to know (like a position matrix, an orientation matrix, a mesh model, a texture map, etc., depending on whether or not the directory represented a model or a transformation).<p>For data in /scenegraph/, SceneGraph_fs would accept well-formatted writes to a node&#x27;s files as a means to update the node in the scene--for example, to translate the node, you would write a new matrix to the object&#x27;s positional matrix file (the write() would return EPERM if the matrix was malformatted).  To create or modify an object atomically, you could describe it under /tmp/ in SceneGraph_fs, and rename() it into place.  You could manage lights and lighting data in the same way.<p>Of course, the graphics card interfacing happens in filesystem implementation.  But, the application interacts with the scenegraph as a filesystem, not as an object.",1410897307

8326719,comment,8324475,8326630,4,0,peterwwillis,,,"You mean a single-user host? Mainly just reporting critical issues to the user.<p>Mail is a store-and-forward reliable messaging service that individuals and services can take advantage of. The primary way Ubuntu, RedHat, etc have used it for years is to allow the user to receive notifications of critical incidents in a way that they will see regularly. Things like disk usage reports, hacker attacks, packages upgraded/installed, cron job errors, etc.<p>The problem is everyone stopped using native e-mail clients years ago and now everyone uses webmail. So nobody ever checks their mailbox to find out the problems going on in their own host.<p>--<p>This is different than logging, by the way. Logs are intended to provide an archival record of events that the applications think you might need to know about. They do nothing to report to the user what is going on <i>right now</i>. Ideally you will get both a log <i>and</i> an e-mail when something bad happens, so you can delete the e-mail and keep the log.<p>This could all be solved by a very thin application that pops up when a new message arrives in the mail spool, highlighted in bold if it came from the local host. The user could be notified of critical issues in real time and have a built-in system to manage the reports (export/forward, sort, search, etc).<p>As far as it filling up your disk, mail spools don&#x27;t get rotated, for obvious reasons. The simple compromise would be to either compress or rotate mail spools rather than get rid of them entirely - but that&#x27;s too sensible a compromise for most :-)<p>Right now in one server I work on there are 9,961 messages in root&#x27;s mail spool. You know how many of those message subjects are unique? 10. Do you know what they all have in common? They&#x27;re all cron jobs that had some minor error that could have been corrected by me the first time I saw it. But I never saw it, because I don&#x27;t log in as root, and as they pile up i&#x27;m less interested in digging through them.<p>A smart e-mail client could solve duplicate messages and console alerts. Some process optimization on the part of the distros could fix this whole mess. Removing the mail just buries it.",1410897177

8326708,comment,8325714,8326509,6,0,lstamour,,,"Navigating on Android is vastly different -- it&#x27;s designed so every activity (screen) is uniquely identifiable and can be referenced by other apps, browser URLs, etc. Activities can register which intents they support in AndroidManifest.xml, so it&#x27;s not dynamic, but not heavy-weight either.<p>Sharing from a third-party or launching from inside your own app, it&#x27;s largely the same thing to an activity. As you navigate, it&#x27;s like a web browser, your back button keeps a history of where you&#x27;ve been across apps that will work different than controls within the app to navigate back (Up). You can also pass content between activities, just as you would for sharing or viewing actions.<p>Primarily, navigation to different activities is via Intents: <a href=""http://developer.android.com/guide/components/intents-filters.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://developer.android.com/guide/components/intents-filter...</a> You can explicitly tell it which activity to load (as if using URLs) or you can identify the action (view or share) and mime/type of your text or binary data. <a href=""http://developer.android.com/training/sharing/send.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://developer.android.com/training/sharing/send.html</a><p>Common intents: <a href=""http://developer.android.com/guide/components/intents-common.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://developer.android.com/guide/components/intents-common...</a><p>So &quot;sharing&quot; or interacting between apps, or within your own app, or your app and system apps, is... basically baked in to Android, and far more common than you&#x27;d expect. It&#x27;s like a more powerful version of &quot;Open With&quot; that isn&#x27;t restricted to files saved to disk.<p>I&#x27;m not sure you can send more than one type of data at a time, though it wouldn&#x27;t surprise me if there&#x27;s an Intent/Action for that as well.<p>The counter to this is incredibly long lists of apps to pick from, prompts for which app to view something in (like a URL or media type) and other annoyances that you get with increased flexibility. It&#x27;s pretty cool though. You can even have certain URLs open certain apps as you browse in Chrome, so if your Google search takes you to a blog that links you to Netflix, you could hop directly from the Google app, to the Chrome app, to the Netflix app and it could feel seamless, one screen to the next.",1410896964

Call &#x27;close&#x27; when done. There may be multiple files you need to access to get the particular behavior you want.<p>Object based API - Browse around the docs until you find that particular subsystem&#x27;s API. Read a bunch. Finally instantiate the object you need. Set all of the objects various properties. Call CreateObject(object, options). Wait, go back and create a options object. Set all of the properties on <i>that</i> object as well. Try that until you figure out you needed to call CreateObjectEx instead. Hit your head on the desk for a couple hours until you figure out that you also need to call RunObject, and that one of the parameters on the options object was set wrong.<p>As a programmer, the file-based API is just a layer of indirection to make things easier, and shouldn&#x27;t be considered a limiting factor.<p>Then again, there&#x27;s this article about Event Tracing on Windows, that makes me think it&#x27;s just this iteration of OO-based operating system, and a better designed API would do us all a favor.<p><a href=""http://mollyrocket.com/casey/stream_0029.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://mollyrocket.com/casey/stream_0029.html</a>",1410896274

Copyrights only ensure that a specific embodiment of an idea (e.g. source code) is protected from being redistributed without the author&#x27;s consent. Patents, on the other hand, do provide protection to an inventor for their ideas.<p>Movies and music as discrete, creative works are not patent-able. But novel methods for creating movies and music can certainly be patented. The same is true for software. The code itself isn&#x27;t eligible for patent application, but the ideas behind them are. And I think the author of the linked article disingenuously conflates the two ideas in order to advance their argument.<p>Let&#x27;s say a programmer invents a new method for quickly factoring prime numbers and develops it into a C library and begins selling it. I buy a license to use the library and eventually figure out how it works. Software copyrights prevent me from redistributing the original library, but I can create my own based on that programmer&#x27;s idea and distribute it as my own. However, if that programmer patents their factoring process, then they have protection against my new implementation from undercutting theirs.<p>Patents can provide protection to entities that have invested heavily in researching and developing their ideas by preventing someone else from reaping their benefits. Likewise, they can foster innovation by forcing other entities to solve similar problems in novel ways. But that&#x27;s not really what&#x27;s happening with software patents right now. The system obviously needs to be modernized, but that can&#x27;t happen without an honest debate from both sides.",1410895382

Officers of a company have a fiduciary duty to the corporation, and shareholders have a claim on the profits of the corporation, but no law requires that a corporation devote itself to profit above all else - and for good reason, since otherwise activist shareholders might demand that Apple cease the relatively uncertain business of making pretty computers and offer financial services instead, since finance is the single most profitable sector of the US economy.<p>As a shareholder, you have the right to vote in the election of  directors to the board (let&#x27;s skip over all the differently nuanced varieties of stock or we&#x27;ll be here all day), and <i>that&#x27;s it</i>.

Ford Motor Company</i>, but nowadays most courts look to <i>Shlensky v. Wrigley</i> in which the court held that directors are obliged only to do whatever they consider to be in the best interests of &#x27;the corporation which they serve.&#x27;<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dodge_v._Ford_Motor_Company"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dodge_v._Ford_Motor_Company</a>\n<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shlensky_v_Wrigley"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shlensky_v_Wrigley</a><p>You might like to read further on the topic from Professor Lynn Stout, who is professor of corporate law at Cornell University and has written a whole book on this topic - summarized at the link below, which also includes a link to the content in pdf form.<p><a href=""https://blogs.law.harvard.edu/corpgov/2012/06/26/the-shareholder-value-myth/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://blogs.law.harvard.edu/corpgov/2012/06/26/the-shareho...</a>",1410894337

8326347,comment,8324578,8325793,6,0,tracker1,,,"It&#x27;s funny, I have an easier time getting friends/family on to a usable Linux OS than myself.  I tend to use windows on the desktop (more about cost/value) and OSX for my laptops...  I run Linux for my HTPC, and on servers.<p>I run multiple monitors and multiple drives in my desktop, and generally one of those two things will lead me to pain when it comes to installation, or an upgrade cycle with the OS.  I really don&#x27;t like playing with my desktop for a half a day to get it running again when I&#x27;m trying to get work done.<p>Given, it&#x27;s a lot better today than in years past, I just haven&#x27;t had it in me to go to Linux for a month, only to have an update break something that will take hours to fix.  That just doesn&#x27;t happen as much in OSX or Windows.<p>I kind of wish one desktop platform would come to true prominence in Linux, and I care less about which one, as any one... then that one can get a lot better.  I don&#x27;t even mind gnome 3 or unity so much.  I just want something that will keep working right through a few upgrade cycles... opposed to where I really consider not running updates on my desktop.<p>My last attempt at Linux for a primary OS was about a year and a half ago.  I tend to get the bug to try it out every couple years.  Eventually, I hit a wall a week or few weeks in that I just don&#x27;t have time/patience to deal with.<p>PC-BSD was also a <i>really</i> nice option, but the limited VM options and support for current hardware really killed that for me.  I think BSD fits my mindset better, but Linux has become more ubiquitous.<p>Either way, I would love to see a truly great desktop Linux platform for me.  A power user and programmer who likes to tinker with stuff, but wants something that has an ok ui, that gets regular updates without issue.  Most of the time, when I did update, it was more for something I wanted to play with other than the main OS.",1410894057

""New processors are going to make all these new things possible."" And yet there's still no computer holding a reasonably intelligent conversation with you if you call Dell customer support. Actually, there isn't even a human doing that.",1197921465

90407,comment,90325,90375,0,0,pchristensen,,,"Toolbar rearrangement was a bad example. Try this: I wish like nothing other that Windows Mobile 5 would realize that when I press Text Messages with no new messages, go straight to ""Compose Message"" and rotate the screen to landscape, or if there are new messages, go to the oldest new message.  I've done that for 98% of the times I've opened Text Messages, and I'd imagine most usage of most apps by most users fits into a few similar buckets. <p>Don't underestimate the value of saving every user 5 seconds  each time they use your app.",1197919941

If your audience is mainstream, you need to keep it simple.  I worked at a job/employment site recently which was doing some cool-ass AJAX UI for the consumer part of the site.  The entire product team LOVED it.  Usability tests were a disaster.  Users were confused and frustrated.  The time saved with AJAX was lost when the user had to actually THINK about what to do on the page.<p>""For website usability, the problem is not whether a specific operation takes 1 second or 10 seconds; people typically perform each operation only once or twice. The problem for websites is the 5-10 minutes users lose when they do something wrong because the site is too complicated. (After such an experience, they usually leave -- and you lose the business.) Simplicity is more important than efficiency for done-once actions.""<p>Of course, if your audience is geeky, go nuts! :-)",1197919841

90400,comment,90325,90375,0,0,pchristensen,,,"I'm not saying that's what I would want, but have you ever watched a non-techie use the computer?  Just looked over their shoulder and watched them?  It's horrifying!  I can only watch my wife for about 2 minutes before I start belting out things like ""You don't need to double click links on the web!"" or ""If you double click on an app, you have to give it a couple seconds to load or else you're making the problem worse!""<p>What a smart OS would do was watch you for a while and notice what you do, and then make a decision based on the statistics: let's say 85% of the time, your keys are in the vide poche and you find them immediately, and the other 15% of the time they're somewhere else and it takes you 5 minutes to find them.  Then it would warp them to the right place (the place your actions showed them was right) with a note and an option to ""always do this"".  I shudder to think of MSFT's implementation of this (Clippy), but if a smart company along the lines of Humanized did it, and used statistics instead of some clever algorithm (didn't we just read about Google doing that?), it could be a godsend for average users.",1197919269

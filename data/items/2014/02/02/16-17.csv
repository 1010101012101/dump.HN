For various reasons, I took up teaching (in the UK) but I&#x27;ve decided it&#x27;s not for me.  The hours are ridiculous (I commonly work 60 hours a week if not more), there is constant stress and pressure from management and the situation for teachers looks like it will get worse with all the changes the current government is introducing.<p>I love working with children and I love Maths. I thought teaching was the perfect career for me but I&#x27;m at risk of burning out if I do this for much longer.  I have been looking for other jobs (mostly in finance and software) but lack of experience is hurting my prospects. I have been trying to build an open source portfolio but I simply do not have the time to work on it.  Has anyone else made the jump from teaching to industry and if so, do you have any advice?",1391360373

During development, designers are focused on getting the timing (rhythm) right between challenge (say ennemies or holes) and corresponding rewards (powerups or secret exits). This ultimately plays/tricks how our brains are wired (effort needs reward) in order to engage users and ultimately enjoy the game... and pay again (and again) for the sequels/updates when they need their fix.<p>Imho IAP is an interesting return to the origins of video gaming (and coin-based arcades) and refocuses the industry on getting the core ingredient right, the feedback loop, rather than betting it all on graphics, story, feature-creep... and marketing.<p>Marketing is disproportionally important when you need to convince your game is worth paying upfront, even in a seemingly minimal amount, as mobile gaming is a very &quot;dispensable&quot; expense in the general public.<p>There is no ROI in marketing an IAP game that does not engage enough of its users (enough).\nOn the other hand, marketing heavily an upfront-cost game can draw sales, sometimes thanks to the franchise name as well, despite providing no to little entertainent to most of its users as the feedback loop is just not good enough to engage them.<p>For good or bad, I think IAP is accelerating adoption of data-driven practices for video game design. As an engineer/scientist, this is very interesting.<p>Last but not least, IAP probably helps expand the (mobile) gaming audience to people who would have otherwise either not played game(s) at all or would have downloaded illegally.<p>In the long term, I believe this can only be good for the industry. The bad apples of IAP will be regulated by better consumer protections for the worst &quot;abuses&quot; and more naturally over time by the users themselves as they get more familiar with the model and more &quot;meaningful&quot; IAP titles become available.",1391360345

Yet, with &quot;95% success rate&quot; and &quot;<= 2 compiles&quot; is basically asking your &quot;patent-writing-guru-for-hire&quot; to sacrifice quality for speed in getting the job done.  Make no mistake, the english words used in patent Claims is as serious and deliberate as the writing of any code - a wrong placement of a comma, period, semi-colon, choice of words, or ordering is on the same level as a misplaced bracket, for-loop, choice of data structure, etc...  At some point, they&#x27;ll likely come to bite.<p>Take coding as analogy - anyone can write code that compiles AND then claim he&#x27;s got 95% success rate at compiling - but the question is whether the end result is worth the time, effort, and expense spent.  Just as there is a justification for top coders to be paid upwards of $150k/yr despite the existence of $5k/yr alternatives: QUALITY.<p>If you are a startup with real money poured into true R&D (e.g. where many trials and experiments and dead-ends were required to achieve the innovation) that can then be easily duplicated and you determine that you need solid protection - then investors demand you to get some defensible attribute - patents offer this.  I suggest you simply won&#x27;t get that with someone who claims a 95% success rate in <= 2 iterations.  Impossible.<p>If you still don&#x27;t believe me, then give me your patent number and I&#x27;ll detail you some simple workarounds that competitors can (and will if need be) use to completely avoid your patent - aka workaround.<p>[1] technically, there is no such thing as a software patent",1391359460

During development, designers are focused on getting the timing (rhythm) right between challenge (say ennemies or holes) and corresponding rewards (powerups or secret exits). This ultimately plays/tricks how our brains are wired (effort needs reward) in order to engage users and ultimately enjoy the game... and pay again (and again) for the sequels/updates when they need their fix.<p>Imho IAP is an interesting return to the origins of video gaming (and coin-based arcades) and refocuses the industry on getting the core ingredient right, the feedback loop, rather than betting it all on graphics, story, feature-creep... and marketing.<p>Marketing is important when you need to convince your game is worth paying upfront, even in a seemingly minimal amount, as mobile gaming is a very &quot;dispensable&quot; expense in the general public.<p>There is no ROI in marketing an IAP game that does not engage enough of its users (enough). On the other hand, marketing heavily an upfront-cost game can draw sales, sometimes thanks to the franchise name as well, despite providing no to little entertainent to most of its users as the feedback loop is just not good enough to engage them.<p>For good or bad, I think IAP is accelerating adoption of data-driven practices for video game design. As an engineer/scientist, this is very interesting.<p>Last but not least, IAP probably helps expand the (mobile) gaming audience to people who would have otherwise either not played game(s) at all or would have downloaded illegally.<p>In the long term, I believe this can only be good for the industry.\nThe bad parts of IAP will be regulated by better consumer protections for the worst &quot;abuses&quot; and more naturally over time by the users themselves as they get more familiar with the model and more &quot;meaningful&quot; IAP titles become available.",1391358270

Perhaps that reflects its value but it also reflects the dynamics of the U.S. stock market.<p>In India you might get bought by Wipro but they are the kind of people (for better and for worse) who have their feet on the ground when it comes to valuing things.",1391356928

It has ink level warnings which I can not get around without new cartridge and new ink chips.<p>I found a way to get firmware and how to upload firmware manually. I also disassembled it and found few spots where I could change ARM asm code to jump around ink level checks. But I could not figure out how to put it all back together so printer would use this firmware instead. My naive approach did not work well and I bricked it (not a big deal).<p>I would love to read more about process people used to, for example, build DD-WRT, which I believe is modification of stock firmware.",1391356912

Just think of all of the applications of Neuroscience + X (CS, Philosophy, Psychology, Chemistry, etc.). Sure, there are few (no?) people today that can claim mastery of 10 or 20 fields, but most of the cutting edge research does seem to require expert knowledge of 2 or 3.",1391356815

He got into the system before the big shift to lecturers and adjuncts, and since he has been in the system for a long time there is a long history of salary increases, back when times were good, and never a decrease - the phenomenon of sticky wages in action.<p>Whether his compensation is <i>fair</i> is a different question.  His homepage lists what courses he is teaching but not the number of actual sections.  A lecturer can teach three sections of a full-time four-credit course.  With preparation, grading and contact hours this constitutes a 40-hour workweek.",1391356811

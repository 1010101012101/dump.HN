8591815,comment,8590922,8591665,0,0,sdouglas,,,"Hi aston. As you suggest in your post, the majority of demand for bitcoin borrowing comes from market making traders on bitcoin exchanges. They have a need to borrower for a number of reasons, including going short. You say that currently there are cheaper ways to short, which is true. For example, on Bitfinex the borrowing rate is something like 4% APR. However, the rate is also very volatile and can jump up to 50%+ when demand is high. That&#x27;s one reason why borrowers receive funds from us. Another is that they can use their funds on Coinfloor, which offers access to the GBP/BTC market. Trading of this kind is very popular right now, so I can assure you that these people exist. You and other posters are right to be concerned about Ponzi scheme. What might reassure you and others is reading our full T&Cs - you&#x27;ll see the time and care we have put in to them. They might give an indication of how we do not want to do anything illegal, or even unprofessional. However, there&#x27;s always going to be an element of trust involved and if you&#x27;re too suspicious then you should keep your bitcoin in your own wallet until we&#x27;re able to prove ourselves.",1415735968

For all of us reading this article we assume this jack ripper strain is the bomb, but really it just happens that the grower he got it from grew some good jack the ripper or whatever. I work in the industry, and mostly people will be like, Oh I tried this strain and its no good, but its just because they got it from a mediocre grower and indeed it wasn&#x27;t as good as the real deal. Also, there are hundreds of seed companies selling similar strains under various names and thus one persons og kush isn&#x27;t the same as another.<p>The problem with this is, outside of places like Colorado, Oregon, and Washington, under the guise of medical marijuana its now more important for the specific review of a flower that can be reproduced by the grower.

How can that ever be so, you ask? It turns out that children under 10 are more likely to engage with content presented in Comic Sans than &quot;plain&quot; fonts.<p>Seeing this, I can&#x27;t help but wonder if someone could design a quirky, &quot;fun&quot; font specifically to appeal to children, which incorporates the same ideas used here - perhaps exaggerated even further. Undiagnosed dyslexia is a significant cause of children falling behind at school, so there&#x27;s a lot of potential benefit in getting that design right and then producing learning materials with it.<p>As is, this could even be used as an simple test for dyslexia, by A/B testing quizzes of roughly the same difficulty, presented in different fonts.

The danger lies in becoming such an elite, closed group due to blind moderation and banning even the most innocent members over a perceived slight, that the moderators themselves end up the trolls of what is left of the community.<p>For example, there&#x27;s a certain GNU/Linux distro that is maintained by a core group of devs who have become overtly hostile to any new users of their project, and actively seek to discourage &quot;newbies&quot; from seeking help and getting any benefit out of the project. One would think the toxic atmosphere would have killed the distro off long ago, yet it&#x27;s maintaining popularity and even seeing an uptick in a certain niche community. I certainly don&#x27;t understand how it thrives with such a rotten core; yes, it&#x27;s overall a very well done distro, but even the best product normally can&#x27;t survive that kind of cancer.<p>That&#x27;s not to say that HN would ever end up like that; indeed, from what I&#x27;ve seen they are doing an excellent job overall with maintaining and moderating this community.

Alas, we&#x27;re not Bitcoin billionaires.<p>You&#x27;re right on a number of counts, but I disagree slightly with a couple of your points. For example, our borrowers are not &quot;outside of our control&quot;, because they only borrow on very specific accounts where we have implemented stop-loss logic and where the withdrawal address belongs to us. This functions in a similar way to when you trade through a broker.<p>We have not included terms of service on our website, and this is something we should do. However, we do make sure to share the full T&Cs with lenders and borrowers prior to transacting. Right now these are in the form PDF documents which outline clearly each parties responsibilities. Send me an email if you want to take a look.<p>Point taken about &quot;heading in the direction&quot; of a Ponzi scheme. I know what you mean. We could say, &quot;oh, we&#x27;ve had a bad week, let&#x27;s just repay our existing lenders with our new lenders funds&quot;. It&#x27;s a slippery slope. To avoid this we separate client funds. So for each our of clients we know where their funds are at any given time, and do not just let funds flow from one to the other. Point also taken about trading less. Obviously we want to grow, but not to the detriment of our quality of service.<p>On the point of lawyers and legislation in general, we have consulted a number of lawyers in the UK and US. Generally, the feedback we have received is that Bitcoin is a very grey area, with most governments in a &#x27;wait and see&#x27; mode. However, we want to act as if we were already a regulated financial institution and stay ahead of the curve (one day, if the FCA accepts bitcoin companies into the fold, we will be regulated).",1415734487

I can see this being immediately useful for things like large database servers: instead of re-priming caches on reboots you just have them already warmed up. You can also suddenly have a whole lot more &quot;RAM&quot; at the cost of its speed.<p>I do have a hard time picturing what this will look like if it was as fast as traditional RAM. If I can store everything in RAM, from the OS binaries, to the running processes, it certainly has a kind of elegance to it. Lots of microcontrollers already act this way: all your hardware has an address in a single address space, be at a hardware port, ROM, RAM, NVRAM, etc. However, I wonder how the modern UNIX OS will work with a system like this without block devices at all. I wonder if what it&#x27;d do is actually just use RAM disks, and years from now we&#x27;ll still be doing this the way we do double emulation of the TTY. That&#x27;d be kind of sad since it means we can never get away from the concept of old block devices.<p>On the other hand it&#x27;s damn convenient to be able to just append to a file and not have to worry about reallocating it.

The levels are simply numbing, beyond gratuitous, so a few books on it simply fails to shock. On the other hand, Vernor Vinge&#x27;s &quot;A Deepness in the Sky&quot; featured a much smaller amount of violence (as done by Emergents) it did happen to be realistic and managed to create great amount of empathy (at several points, I was close to simply putting the book down due to the bleak and hopeless situation of some of the characters) with the characters (who -- both humans and aliens -- seemed a lot more alien than culture&#x27;s non-Homo Sapiens Pan-Humans). Of course comparing &quot;hard SF&quot; to Banks is quite a stretch, but the &quot;non-alien aliens&quot; and &quot;hypersadism&quot; aspects subtracted rather than added to Banks.<p>On the other hand, Banks&#x27; manages to do what very few can: the characters are great, multidimensional, and show development; the big ideas are big, and yet story-telling and plot aren&#x27;t sacrificed. There are very few other SF writers who are able to do this (Gene Wolfe, Stan Robinson come to mind).<p>I&#x27;m going to stay out of the discussion of libertarianism (there&#x27;s a corollary to Godwin&#x27;s law: unless a certain German leader -- not Frederich the Great or Angela Merkel -- is mentioned first, any online conversation will ultimately end up becoming a debate about libertarianism), but I&#x27;ll leave these few links out there:<p><a href=""http://reason.com/archives/2013/09/15/the-endless-lives-of-iain-m-banks"" rel=""nofollow"">http://reason.com/archives/2013/09/15/the-endless-lives-of-i...</a> (a positive libertarian review of Banks&#x27; work, which acknowledges Banks&#x27; explicit rejection of libertarianism)<p><a href=""http://a.b.i-b.tripod.com/html/faq_text.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://a.b.i-b.tripod.com/html/faq_text.htm</a> -- see the question about &quot;Top Ten&quot; SF novels according to Banks, the first is quite explicitly libertarian &quot;The Moon is a Harsh Mistress&quot; (there&#x27;s debate as to whether Heinlein himself was a libertarian, but it&#x27;s undeniable that at least some of his works are libertarian fiction; OTOH &quot;Beyond the Horizon&quot; is quite Culture-ish in terms of describing a post-scarcity society).<p>There&#x27;s also &quot;The Dispossesed&quot; amongst those books which describes an non-property owning anarchist society ( I haven&#x27;t read it, although it&#x27;s on my list). For an example of very well written anarcho-capitalist SF, I strongly recommend Vinge&#x27;s The Peace War, The Ungoverned, and Marooned in Realtime. The Ungoverned goes as far as describe private ownership of nuclear weapons, and yet the novels/novellas avoid the &quot;shill political screed&quot; feel some of the other explicitly &quot;libertarian SF&quot; works have.",1415733281

It compiles to JS to work across modern web browsers while smoothing a fair deal for you in the way of optimizations and cross-browser issues. But that&#x27;s saying nothing of the real reason folks choose Dart, or JS or any transcompiler or framework for that matter: the ways in which it may benefit you and your projects, relative to your other choices.<p>In Dart&#x27;s case relative to JS, I think the language is more sane, debugging easier, the core libraries really powerful, the tooling more uniform, and the ecosystem more organized. I like the idea of one language on client and server, and yet the way it&#x27;s done in JS-land with Node feels wilder and less approachable than I liked when I researched it some years back. That&#x27;s just me, and admittedly I don&#x27;t have all that much experience in the world of JS before I dove into Dart.<p>There are some tradeoffs of course, the biggest being that you sort of block yourself off from a world of JS libraries and even community to some extent. There&#x27;s dart:js interop to wrap any JS library, and work being done to make that even easier with js:interop, but I think there&#x27;ll always be some disconnect. Still, it&#x27;s about costs versus benefits, and there are many benefits that I think ultimately outweigh the costs.<p>The point is there are a whole host of reasons to choose Dart, and I think it&#x27;s foolish for any one of those reasons to be because you think it&#x27;ll unseat JS. It won&#x27;t, but there might be merit to it unseating JS in your own workflow.",1415732950

It doesn&#x27;t even do a good job of cleaning my dishes in my dishwasher. I buy Poland Spring by the case, keep it in the refrigerator, and drink that instead. I have nothing against drinking tap water in principle, but my actual tap water leaves a lot to be desired.",1415732481

There are a lot of companies succeeding with ruby or node, but also a lot of companies failing with them. I&#x27;ll bet the strike rate is better for Erlang companies.",1415732473

Also when fast food/day-to-day restaurants give you a cup for water, it&#x27;s tiny and uncovered.<p>I would prefer tap water in all cases. It is never a convenient choice.<p>edit: If you wanted to legislate effectively (rather than in a Bloombergian manner), just require that tap water be a first class citizen at restaurants (same cups, same sizes), and that the purchase of soda/bottled water cannot be involved in a package discount, unless tap water would give you the same discount.",1415732465

Now I agree that having to understand internals might be seen as an engineering failure, however
* internals are pretty quick to cover
* for students learning software development, I thought it would be interesting to see that you can have very few low-level objects that offer powerful high-level actions",1415732422

It <i>is</i> fun. I still played outside, had friends, and lived a childhood. What I got out of it are skills that are in demand, a head start on life, and adult, mature friends who kept me out of trouble and helped me build a fun, happy life for myself.<p>I owe <i>everything</i> to programming. I was a kid from a small town in Alabama and now I&#x27;m a happy software engineer in Los Angeles. I got to go to the first Clojure Conj conference when I was 16, speak at the second at 17, and get an internship that led to a job at around the same time. I met the best friends I could have ever met through it and have had more fun that I could have ever imagined having as a direct result of it.<p>That said, we&#x27;re not entirely at odds. It is important to keep yourself healthy and such and not let it completely take over your life. I just felt it important to provide a different perspective on the matter.",1381201198

He must desire definitely to jump higher than the other men who are in for the same competition. He must let no feeble feelings of mercy (sneaked from the sickening Little Englanders and Pro-Boers) prevent him from trying to do his best. He must remember that a competition in jumping is distinctly competitive, and that, as Darwin has gloriously demonstrated, THE WEAKEST GO TO THE WALL.</i><p>Yeah, that Chesterton, what an anti-capitalist.",1381201056

6512752,comment,6508442,6509122,3,0,lsc,,,"I think I can speak to this.   I was a lot like &#x27;those kids&#x27; -  except that I came of age in 1997, in an earlier bubble.  Note, to this day I don&#x27;t have any college.  Standards were low in 1997, and I got lucky and got a prestigious job during the bubble, and got lucky and got a job after the crash... (and there may have been some brains and hard work in there, too... but there was a lot of luck.)  so I &#x27;made the cut&#x27; as it were, and remained employed.  (My salary didn&#x27;t even drop, though it was flat for a few years.)<p>I&#x27;m sure you also lived through that boom, but it was... more vivid for me.  Imagine;  graduating out of one of the worst high schools in the state.   A hellish experience (by the standards of a middle-class white guy)   and immediately, you are immersed in a world where everyone wants you.     It was... pretty great.<p>Note, I&#x27;m a sysadmin, so I probably hang out with more C types;  systems programmers and embedded programmers, but I&#x27;m not really that much of a programmer myself.   (I mean, I can patch things, and I can sling enough perl to handle many tens of thousands of nodes;  I can read code, and I know C.  I&#x27;m just not /very good/ by the standards of systems people or embedded software folks.)<p>Sysadmins... well, we mostly aspire to be systems programmers or embedded software people.   We really look up to you.   And we generally look down on web developers, and php programmers.   A lot of that is, well, it&#x27;s our job to clean up after the PHP guys.   We&#x27;re the janitors;  the busboys;  the PHP guys are the waiters who actually deal with customers, get tips, and all the credit, but we have to clean up after them, and nobody notices us unless we don&#x27;t do our job right (at which point, everything goes to hell.  We&#x27;re like the bus boy, the janitor, the plumber, the appliance repair tech...   In my capacity as SysAdmin, I actually solved a problem of a toilet that was overflowing in an office above a restaurant.[1])<p>>Moreover, I rather worry about all the people coming up in the bubble, thinking it is bedrock reality.<p>My impression was that yeah, it seemed normal at first, but... it quickly became apparent that it was a bubble, even to a 17 year old kid who barely made it through high school.  It was talked about pretty openly.  At this point, I don&#x27;t have a big corporate job, but my impression (I have a bunch of friends at google, and a few at facebook)  is that this time around folks, especially the younger folks either really believe, or they are pretending to really believe.<p>>I wonder at their job prospects when they are 35, have a family, don&#x27;t have time to go back to school to learn calculus or what have you, and didn&#x27;t &#x27;hit&#x27; and make fuck you money<p>If it is like the last crash?  the top 30% have zero to worry about.  There is plenty of webdev work, and there will be for some time going.   They might not get signing bonuses anymore, but eh, they&#x27;ll be comfortable.    The bottom 50%, yeah, will need to get new jobs elsewhere.   The rest?  they&#x27;ll have problems for a while, but after a few years of retail, they&#x27;ll get back on their feet.<p>(Note, percentiles are judged by employer perception here, not actual skill.)<p>Overall?  I&#x27;d say it&#x27;s a reasonably good bet for a youngster.   Nowhere else can a young person get as much respect.   After the crash?  sure, maybe you will have to do something else, but that&#x27;s okay.  Nothing is forever.<p>[1]Oh man, it&#x27;s one of my favorite stories.  I love it when I find technical solutions to social problems.   Our office was above a Chinese restaurant.   Maybe 30 phone support folks, maybe 5 technical folks.   The bathroom was overused, and poorly maintained.  the toilets regularly overflowed from what I would call reasonable amounts of toilet paper.    Anyhow, if you grabbed a plunger (or hollered for help, so the office manager would grab the plunger)  it was okay.  Not that big of a deal.   But some people would just leave, hoping nobody would notice.<p>The boss wanted to install cameras in the bathroom... or to have a sign-in sheet.   &#x27;Gimme $20&#x27;  I said.    I got a water alarm.  They make &#x27;em for basements.   We put it in, and tested it (mid-day, and the alarm was /loud/)    The toilet never overflowed again.",1381200932

6512748,comment,6512597,6512712,16,0,lemming,,,"Cursive is based off a fork of La Clojure from a long time ago. Since then I&#x27;ve rewritten 80% of the code in Clojure and added a lot of new functionality and fixed a lot of bugs. There&#x27;s lots of new stuff in there, but the main highlights are Paredit-style structural editing and good nREPL integration (for local and remote REPLs). Jan Thom also kindly let me bundle the leiningen plugin so that&#x27;s provided out of the box and I&#x27;ll be making a lot of improvements to that over the next couple of weeks.

You use a laser to spherically compress a 1 mm diameter spherical capsule. The capsule implodes, stagnates, and blows (releasing energy in the explosion). Then you do do it again 0.1 seconds later.<p>NIF uses an &quot;indirect drive&quot; design. Instead of directly illuminating the spherical target with a bunch of lasers, you blast the inner surface of a gold cylinder with the shell at the center of the cylinder. The cylinder gets hot, emits x-rays, which are absorbed by the capsule. The x-ray drive tends to be &quot;smoother&quot; than direct illumination.<p>The big problem with ICF is hydrodynamic stability. It is like trying to squeeze a water balloon with your fingers.

6512658,comment,6510602,6512372,1,0,aric,,,"Indeed. My issue of great concern is that many people are unable to admit nor even understand the nature and negatives of their own actions and beliefs when their morality is forcefully imposed on others. This is not to say there aren&#x27;t subjective positives in a person or group&#x27;s views. This is only to say that there are <i>also</i> negatives.<p>The more one selectively filters and dismisses the negatives of forcefully imposing [what one wants] on others, the more that person becomes conditioned to accept violence. The continued path of this mindset is easily one where imprisonment and economic suppression, and the overall appeasement of violent systems, increasingly becomes a rational response to even <i>trite</i> conduct. Disobedience by those who are different becomes itself vilified. Ends begin to justify means. Force imposed upon nonviolent people that would otherwise be heinous becomes common.<p>In contrast, I find that the more someone begins to examine, to self-assess, the negative nature of his or her own actions, the less willing he or she is to use force to impose those subjective views. It leads to admission and mindfulness. Recognizing the violence [of self] can take one on a path of peace and tolerance [of others], where one begins to seek more progress through culture alone rather than through law.<p>Laws by their nature are oppressive. We&#x27;d agree that there are many variations of systems and laws that we might mutually favor in principle. Though, in fewer words, the more a system lends itself to arbitrary law, the more a system lends itself to tyranny. That&#x27;s because oppression and violence -- in law or in other forms -- in and of itself is no justification. Systems protecting people <i>from</i> violent actions certainly become a resounding cause when they use forms of oppression to protect people from great oppression (e.g. rape, murder, etc.). Though the way systems of justice do it is largely unjustified (to me), in light of the astonishing increase of a prison-military-police industry and the society that brought it into existence. It&#x27;s one of many systems with systemic problems, in dire need of critical change, humanity, compassion, and transparency.",1381199330

The annual budget of NIH is ~$30B and it funds a high fraction of the most advanced biological research worldwide.  The DOE also has a budget $30B and funds (along with this project) many other projects including alternative energies, advanced computing and the Human Genome Project.  NSF is (only!) another $7B, leaving around $33B addition funds for a diverse research portfolio.<p>This kind of expenditure is required to maintain US at or near the highest level of technology research in the world (other countries can compete with us in many ways, such as lower labor costs).  There are things that can only be physically done in a single location in the US and nowhere else in the world- and it will be that way until on of the postdocs goes back to Europe or Asia and replicates the result in their lab.<p>So yes, $100B is a lot of money- and that&#x27;s the kind of investment that often ends up benefiting the US (and other) economy.

Say you go to a fusion laboratory that employs the top ten fusion scientists in the world, with a current budget of a few hundred million dollars, and you say to them &quot;I&#x27;ve got 2 billion here in additional funding for you. You need to spend it in the next few months because I&#x27;m trying to stimulate an economy right here.&quot;<p>Does that hire you forty more world class fusion scientists? <i>Are there</i> forty more world class fusion scientists?<p>Are those scientists going to go &quot;Fantastic! We&#x27;ll just order up three more of these experimental fusion reactor rigs, here are the plans, we&#x27;ll start hiring engineers and buying up electronic components from the local silicon fab down the road driving all that money into economic productivity for you!&quot; - unlikely. They already have one experimental fusion reactor. Three more the same aren&#x27;t going to get them anywhere any faster. They won&#x27;t know what the next one should look like until they&#x27;ve finished getting results out of this one.<p>Maybe they just spend it all on repainting the lab, buying new office furniture, getting in catered lunches - you might see a marginal improvement in fusion research productivity, and certainly there&#x27;s a local economic stimulus which was the idea there, but you&#x27;re not getting the valuable long term capital value of, say, using the money to rebuild a few bridges.<p>Even if it turns out your ten fusion scientists have a ready proposal to build the next generation experimental fusion reactor, plans are drawn up and costed, and all they need is you to hand over that check for two billion, if they then go ahead and order the parts from China, subcontract a bunch of German engineering firms to build the cooling systems, and get the heavy steelwork welded together in Korea, your stimulus effect just disappeared overseas.<p>Of course, if that experimental fusion reactor turns out to be THE ONE that creates viable economic fusion power, maybe that&#x27;s worth the 2 billion. But that&#x27;s not stimulus spending, that&#x27;s gambling on an investment.",1381197678

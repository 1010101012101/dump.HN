When I got started in the old days we had HyperCard which was my tool of choice  you could so real programming on it, or you could do something very simple. Apple killed Hypercard by neglect, but then Microsoft put out Visual Basic. The result? Within a few years they created a monster that would scare away non-programmers. I'm even amazed that tools like Dreamweaver which should make HTML easy for idiots have become these complex beasts.<p>To me the PC represented a revolution of letting the rest of us own a computer -- and taking it out of the hands of the high priests of mainframes. But I'd like to see the next revolution occur where non-geeks can build apps. No they don't have to be complex apps, but even something that's like the old HyperCard would be cool.",1303617147

Basically it uses the gyro to estimate the position during a gps outage and then it can tell the GPS where to look in the sky for satellites. As it is, the gps has to scan the entire sky and it assumes nothing about its position. Even if you just passed under a bridge and only had a monetary outage.

2478190,comment,2475854,2476275,1,0,KevinEldon,,,"I don't think this strategy is unethical; it is really risky... probably so risky that it's naive for the long term.<p>It's not unethical because the buyer in this case can't really buy up all of the supply  and therefore is just looking for arbitrage opportunities or opportunities to exploit weaknesses in a competitors business model.<p>The opportunities, over time, are very limited though:<p>1) You can't actually buy up all of the supply.  If you were able to buy all of the listed supply and then reset the price you'd soon attract other sellers who had previously unlisted supply.<p>2) If there was real demand for an extremely high priced book I'd guess the author or publisher would be releasing a new version to meet the demand.<p>3) Although some printing of books are considered to be collectible, that market is limited.  Generally the value of the book is the information it provides, which means that as the price rises the (perhaps less informative) substitutes become more appealing to buyers.<p>4) If you exploit a competitor's pricing algorithm enough to make them notice, they'll just change their algorithm.  In this case, perhaps they don't sell you the books or they don't respond to your prices.<p>You might be able to make a few bucks on this strategy, maybe a few people could even eke out a living, but it would be risky... they'd earn it.",1303614664

 - Must keep databases in sync across regions. Periodic is acceptable.
 - Not a lot of budget.<p>OK. My first instinct is to say you're still putting all your eggs in one basket, I'd request we evaluate the idea of using a second cloud provider as a backup.<p>I would also suggest that Route 53 is a pretty new DNS provider, can we look at other providers with a proven track record, at least a secondary server.<p>Now if you're going to insist on sticking with Amazon only and being on a shoe string budget, then we'd set up with region servers. I'd hope we can control the refresh time on Route 53, as I'd want to keep the DNS TTL low. We'd be paying for more requests, but we'd have the flexibility to roll over to another region easily.<p>As for keeping data in sync, or periodic backups, that's really dependent on the data requirements and what type of storage is involved and I wouldn't want to get into it.<p>The main thing I would shoot for is, especially on a low budget, keep it as simple as possible. Even if it means rolling over to an instance with 24 hour old data. That's better than nothing in most application cases. You don't want your interim recovery to be complicated. It should be flip a switch (or change a DNS entry) and there you go. Recovery is going to be a pain, count on it and expect it. Especially if you're on a shoe string budget because you're likely depending on overworked sysadmins who you're keeping too busy to manage accurate recovery testing practices.

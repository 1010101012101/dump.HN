There's some dispute about the best place to draw the line between atheist and agnostic, but no one draws it there.<p>""Agnostic"" means either ""doesn't claim to know whether a god or gods exist"" or ""claims that whether a god or gods exist is unknowable"". Or, occasionally and when it's clear from context, ""doesn't claim to know whether some particular other thing is true or not"". (""I'm agnostic about whether there will be human-level AI within fifty years"", for instance.)<p>Someone who believes in a god or gods is not agnostic in any usual sense. (They might be agnostic on particular questions: ""I believe there's some sort of god, but I'm agnostic as to whether it's the one believed in by Christians"" or whatever.)",1293289138

2038972,comment,2038735,2038735,0,0,waqf,,,"I feel he missed a point on why code and not ""assets"" are open-sourced, though I'm also finding that point it hard to articulate:<p>Because assets are relatively separable (as compared to source code), and relatively liquid, in the sense that you can put a $$$ figure to the cost of replacing them.  If you receive code without graphics, you can still represent all the game objects by solid colored squares and try out the game:  then you can price out replacing them with clip art, or custom professional artwork, depending on your goals.  If you receive graphics without code, then for most values of ""you"" you'll just give up because you can't afford the cost, time and cost/time uncertainty of reproducing the entire code base.",1293289105

2038953,comment,2038392,2038916,0,0,moe,,,"<i>I'll take a language with ugly syntax but beautiful semantics over one with ugly semantics any day.</i><p>Sadly the erlang semantics aren't all beautiful either, at least for the things that most people would use it for today.<p>This quote that I picked up on the erlang mailing list was an eye-opener to me (from memory):<p><pre><code>   Erlang wasn't designed to make easy things easy.\n   It was designed to make hard things possible.\n</code></pre>\nThis explains a lot about the erlang mindset. Things like the obscure syntax or the abhorrent string handling are simply not very high on their priority list.<p>For example, strings weren't used much in the telecom projects that erlang was original conceived for - hence they didn't get much love until recently.<p>Similarly the syntax seemed like a good fit for the problems that erlang was looking to solve, because it makes the expression of very complex, concurrent constructs comparably sane.<p>The problem for us ""normals"" is that in our codebases we very rarely need that kind of expressive power (and the associated learning curve). We tend to need it in 2-3 critical spots, the remaining 99% is best solved by a general-purpose language that allows for quick iteration.<p>Introducing the behemoth of erlang to a project only for these 2-3 spots very rarely passes a cost/benefit analysis.<p>That's why we hack shoddy, slow and fragile bandaids in our go-to languages, instead of using erlang.",1293287795

This isn't a new concern: I remember Usenet discussions over <i>ten years</i> ago about the loss of privacy due to the amount of personal data stored in large corporate databases and how easy it was for that data to be stored and transferred. It's increased exponentially since then. Look, 2 months ago I wanted to send a friend a snail-mail letter but I couldn't remember her whole address. A quick hop to Google Street View and I just ""drove"" down her street from my computer 120 miles away until I recognized her house and got the address off the sign.<p>Seriously guys, find another battle to fight: this one was lost a long time ago. <i>Database Nation</i> <a href=""http://oreilly.com/catalog/9781565926530/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://oreilly.com/catalog/9781565926530/</a> was written a decade ago!<p>Oh, and Merry Christmas :-)",1293287733

Free of charge. I'm not an expert, but I'm fairly skilled at marketing and writing, and I intend to apply myself diligently to this. Details -<p>What:<p>-I'll do a press release for you or your company.<p>-I'm going to spend 10-20 hours reading about press releases. I've already read two books on the topic a couple years ago, I learned a little from two PR people I knew, and I'm going to brush up on it again before starting.<p>-I'll spend whatever it takes to make yours look good. I'm thinking 2-3 hours for a release should be enough. In that time, I'll explore your positioning, what makes your company unique, try to figure out some good stories. Then I'll go and research the state of your industry/market/target customerbase and try to come up with some numbers and trends and stats. I'll pass this back and forth with you a couple times, and then you send it out.<p>Why:<p>1. For the hell of it.<p>2. No, really, this is the sort of thing I do instead of watching TV or playing games. I solve problems and hustle and help people make money. I'm pretty good at it, and I get kick out of it.<p>3. I want to learn more about PR. I'm likely to be doing some PR campaigns in 2-3 months, and I want some live fire practice beforehand. I don't have anything really noteworthy to launch right now on my own, so I'm pledging my blade to your cause.<p>4. I do my best work for other people on deadlines. I don't know why, but I hold external deadlines sacred and almost always meet them, whereas I kind of shrug off my internal deadlines far too often. I don't know why, can't explain it. But I do some of my best work when I'm accountable to other people. I think that'll serve as a good kick in the ass, I've been meaning to learn about this for a while.<p>5. The whole HN community has been awesome to me, and I like to give back a little bit when possible.<p>Who should sign on for this:<p>1. Business owner or operator of some kind of noteworthy project.<p>2. You know me and my general capabilities and the kind of work I do.<p>3. Alternatively, you don't know me, but you like my style and think, ""Hey, this guy is kind of crazy, and what the heck, he's offering to do it for free. Worst-case scenario I burn a couple hours and throw his press release in the trash, best-case scenario I make friends/colleagues with this crazy bastard and whatever he cooks up makes some real money.""<p>4. You have $80 to burn to send your release out on the wires. Like, you could set the money on fire and your life wouldn't be worse off. I <i>think</i> we'll be able to get it right, but I'm not making promises here. If you have employees, sign up. If you've ever bought print media, sign up. If you've bought Google Adwords, sign up. If you've never spent money on any kind of marketing/hiring/expansion ever, you probably shouldn't sign up. I mean, you can, but I'm really not making promises here. If you're on a ramen budget, maybe you don't want to burn two weeks of ramen to send a press release out that might not work.<p>I'm thinking I'll do five of these for people?<p>Contact info in my profile, email me.

Since early on I liked music and <i>classical</i> music, I have some CDs of the music to a few of the famous ballets, right, The Nutcracker, Swan Lake, Coppélia.<p>But, right, via YouTube, it was easy, e.g., to watch some of Coppélia, so I did.  It&#x27;s fun!  It&#x27;s a light comedy, with a cute story by Hoffmann (right, as in <i>Tales of Hoffmann</i>), and a LOT of really pretty girls (right, I&#x27;m a human male!) acting really cute!<p>Movies and the OP?  I&#x27;m coming back to that with Coppélia\nas an example!<p>The YouTube performance I watched was from The\nAustralian Ballet.  Well, too soon that performance\nwas <i>taken down</i> on YouTube.  Bummer!  But, if The \nAustralian Ballet had used YouTube just as a\n<i>free sample</i>, then it worked because I bought the DVD.<p>Now the DVD of Coppélia\non my computer is really nice, nicer to watch\nthan via YouTube.  No matter how the work\ngoes on a day, a little Coppélia\nwill make the day a lot better.<p>Why?  Lasers?  Nope!  Instead of lasers,\nwhat&#x27;s good is just the\n<i>art, entertainment, content,</i> and these\ncome across quite nicely via the DVD.\nThe music is terrific; the\nstory is cute; the girls are\nreally pretty.  Drive 50 miles to a 3D, 4K laser\nmovie version at big bucks?  Likely\nnot.<p>Why?  There&#x27;s an old point:  Once long \nago a guy asked a child which he\nliked better, radio dramas or TV\ndramas.  The boy said radio.\nFor why, he said, &quot;The pictures\nare much better on radio.&quot;.  Yup.<p>Sorry laser guys:  Some of the best\n<i>pictures</i> are what the \nviewer forms in their head\nfrom just hints from the\ncontent itself.<p>Sit down, laser guys:  I have a DVD\nof the original 1933 <i>King Kong</i>.  It&#x27;s\njust black and white, but it&#x27;s still fun!\nThe nicest part is the interplay with\nthe Fay Wary character, the poor, pretty,\nsweet, naive girl, the older, powerful,\nassertive, rich movie producer, the\nhard boiled crew of the ship, etc., the\nbeauty and beast theme -- all that comes\nacross very nicely with just that old\n1933 black and white version.<p>My wife understood drama:  So, once she\ntook us to a summer stock play, only\na few actors, a small stage, a small audience,\nand afterward pointed out to me how\nthere is some <i>magic</i> to the theater,\nthat the audience can really <i>get into</i>\nthe story and experience with just the\nhints of such meager <i>production values</i>.\nNot nearly new since such drama\ngoes way back in English literature\nand the ancient Greek theater.<p>Net, the main issue is the <i>content</i>, not\nthe technology.",1405774748

8057361,comment,8031840,8044517,1,0,snitko,,,"I was tempted to reply, because I think you&#x27;ve made some points I can understand, but object to. And some others I believe you simply misunderstood.<p><i>> Well yeah, your victims pay for it.</i><p>That&#x27;s not what I meant. I meant that when a country starts a war, it&#x27;s not politicians who pay for it. Citizens pay for wars with their taxes. Politicians simply sell them a war, while not investing any money of their own. In fact, what happens is, politicians make money, because there are companies who benefit from wars (oil, military equip and tech), so they lobby politicians. If politicians or companies had to pay for wars out of their own profits, there would be no wars.<p><i>> In theory Capitalism distributes the most to those who provide the most, which sounds great.</i><p>That&#x27;s a misunderstanding. A rich person can only spend that much for himself (even then, by buying things, he actually creates jobs). He then has to invest into something he believes to be sustainable. Thus, I see businessmen as ultimate redistributors. They proved on the market they&#x27;re good at handling money, thus they deserve to have more of them. Politicians only proved they can manipulate public opinion and you are entrusting them your own and someone else&#x27;s tax money. I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s a good idea at all.<p><i>> And you think a society that would pass such a vote would be any kinder in a free market</i><p>Yes, because in a free market the redheads would be able to legally invest money of their own to protect themselves from other people, who wish to kill them. With government, since it has the monopoly on protection and laws, no such thing would be possible. In other words, in a completely free market minorities are able to put a price tag on them being discriminated against, while when you have government, they would actually be paying for their own discrimination. Gay people have been paying taxes just like everyone else, yet until some point, it was even illegal to be gay, not even talking about marriage.<p><i>>No, my whole point is that access to services is a form of freedom</i><p>Very well. Even by your definition then, when government takes a portion of my money as tax for the services I don&#x27;t use or disagree with (like wars) it takes away my freedom to use other services I consider good.<p>The crucial distinction is <i>force</i>. Government is force that is abused because it&#x27;s so centralized. Government is telling other people what they can or cannot do, how they can or cannot spend their money and what services they can or cannot use. It doesn&#x27;t matter what you consider freedom to be. With government some may indeed get a little more &quot;freedom&quot;, but always at the expense of someone else and always with people in the government benefiting most from their position. I&#x27;m simply against this redistribution, because it is based on a system that is inherently unfair and broken. No, it cannot be fixed.",1405774431

If someone suggests a URL to the\noriginal source, then changing the URL helps everybody. The same is true\nfor changing bad titles. Regurgitated blogspam with a linkbaiit title is\nalways annoying, and most aggregators fight against it every single day.<p>The third question is tougher to answer, since you&#x27;d need to do a whole\nlot of reading. The two most common things which will cause the rank of\na submission to drop are users flagging the story, and setting off the\nvoting ring detector (i.e. trying to fake up-votes).<p>Sam Altman (hn user: sama, YC S05, and a YC Partner) mentioned the ring\nvoting detector issues here:\n<a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7972941"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7972941</a><p>And somewhere in the comments of our fearless public moderator Daniel\nGackle (hn user: dang) was mentioned the issue about user flags\naffecting the rank of stories.<p>Your fourth question:<p>4.)

Every prepress shop and printing press on the planet has those swatch books so they can communicate spot colors consistently.<p>However, the rise in recent years of cheap 4/C digital presses and ICC profiling has made Pantone systems less indispensable.",1188219518

46963,comment,46701,46913,0,0,euccastro,,,"I agree the reasoning sounds wrong, but the quote sounds about right.  If insuring $10M for one earthquake costs $10M x 1/5 = $2M, insuring for two symultaneous ones should cost something around $10M x 1/5^2 = $400K.<p>Another surprising thing in that example is that the guy says he could get away with quoting $4M? If insuring either factory for $10M (or insuring both for $5M) costs about $2M, I'd suppose that's the upper bound for a cost evaluation, even if you're lazy.",1188218078

I   took one over from my father, because he didn't like it, either, but I am also not happy with it. I find the plastic parts tend to cut into my legs and hurt me, because I sink into the rubber net too deeply. Also the settings are unstable, every now and then the chair collapses and I have to reconfigure it again. <p>OT: does anybody know how I can determine the exact model type of my Aeron chair, as I would like to put it up on ebay?",1188218068

I just thought it was an interesting counterpoint to the usual competition driven startupping atmosphere.<p>What if you would try to create something because of the inspiration by a muse, rather than because of the prospects of making money.",1188217635

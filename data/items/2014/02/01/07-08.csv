Well that&#x27;s the problem with our patent system. With these &#x27;idea&#x27; patents, you simply have to have enough money to pay a patent lawyer to submit the application and it&#x27;s suddenly a patent. Meanwhile, you have not produced a product, maybe you can&#x27;t, maybe you never intended to! Edison would roll over in his grave if he could see the charlatan inventors all over America proclaiming patents of things as silly as this--skipping to specific audio tracks is as intuitive as having bookmarks in a book. I&#x27;m not saying the method itself is not creative or novel--I am really not in a position to judge as patents are inexplicably incomprehensible. (I mean the first diagram on that patent is ridiculous, did they really have to sketch the CPU?)<p>Invention is about the 99% perspiration. If you can&#x27;t produce the product or convince someone else to make it into something useful, you don&#x27;t deserve a patent.",1391241266

7161151,comment,7161134,7161134,1,0,erbdex,,,"&quot;My experience in working on Graphite has reaffirmed a belief of mine that scalability has very little to do with low-level performance but instead is a product of overall design. I have run into many bottlenecks along the way but each time I look for improvements in design rather than speed-ups in performance. I have been asked many times why I wrote Graphite in Python rather than Java or C++, and my response is always that I have yet to come across a true need for the performance that another language could offer. In [Knu74], Donald Knuth famously said that premature optimization is the root of all evil. As long as we assume that our code will continue to evolve in non-trivial ways then all optimization6 is in some sense premature.&quot;",1391240658

It&#x27;s best to pursue small efforts that can have stupidly large and devastating effect on your opponent.<p>China is investing in sophisticated information attacks to steal military and industry capabilities, disable infrastructure and remove a communications advantage from an invader.<p>Their heavy submarine focus threatens to obliterate trade routes and defend their own, causing others to hesitate to attack or suffer economic devastation. And their precision missiles are a described as a pocket of excellence within the army.<p>They can use their missiles to destroy military satellites, taking away advantages like communication and GPS. On the ground, sending missiles directly into concentrated C&C centres like air craft carriers, command posts, etc can turn the enemy into a semi-organised mob. With the enemy taken down a notch or two, suddenly China&#x27;s moderately trained but extremely numerous ground forces can start to look fairly intimidating.<p>They mention horses for surveying as barbaric compared to survey helicopters, but what a great asset horses would be when both sides have used their precision missiles to take out all of the supporting infrastructure. No maintenance or fuel supply line needed, they even double as their own horse manufacturing line.<p>Whether these approaches are enough to defend or attack, who knows, but the strategy is an excellent and efficient one that shouldn&#x27;t be underestimated.

(Like looking at basketball shooting percentages, and wondering why centers don&#x27;t take all the shots given how high their FG%s are.)",1391238433

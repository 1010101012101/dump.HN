345493,comment,345476,345476,0,0,pg,,,"This is fascinating.  It helps explain why the savings rate in the US has gone down so much since the 1980s.  People didn't suddenly become financially irresponsible.  There was <i>demand</i> for debt, because it was the raw material debt-backed securities were made of.  So companies were working much harder to convince consumers to get into it.<p>Incidentally, though no doubt debt-backed securities will be demonized for a while, I suspect they're useful with proper regulation.  Market crashes often turn out to be due to the appearance of some new economic phenomenon that people get over-excited about initially, causing a boom-bust wave, but which in the long term turns out to be good.",1225137462

345490,comment,344801,345245,0,0,silencio,,,"THANK you. I went to a CC because I dropped out of high school a couple years early with my GED (would have gone completely nuts if I didn't), and there was no way I would get accepted to the top tier universities I wanted to go to in that way. I've also taken classes at both 2 and 4 year universities throughout my middle/high school years.<p>All I can say is that there are some awful teachers like the one above saying DOS is Unix and such complete nonsense, but I've also come across some of the most amazing teachers that even my now-in-4-year-universities friends from high school wish they had for some of the classes we share. Yes, the level of education is not the same, but for the general classes, it's not so different, and sometimes can be a unique and nice experience. Plus, you can transfer, and those classes can count towards your degree. Not everyone is in a CC to get a better job, a lot of people end up transferring to such ""top"" universities like UCLA, UC Berkeley, Stanford, USC and the like (is it obvious I live in California? :) )<p>Lastly, none of this is stopping me from supplementing my education on my own. There are some topics that are rarely taught in many places (like, say, Mac/iPhone programming) I'm interested in. I would hope that's the case with anyone and everyone, not just people involved in top universities and Y Combinator :p",1225137343

High traffic/member numbers don't mean much unless you can monetize them, mostly they just cost you.<p>2) selling to a few large companies is often a much easier path than selling to thousands of individuals.<p>3) there are a million services that are provided almost exclusively by very large companies.  Quite often they do a horrible job.  There's a million opportunities there.<p>4) don't count your chickens before they hatch.  Getting a 1/4 million dollar contract in a month, does NOT mean you'll get one every month.<p>5) if you start to make money, get an accountant/tax person.  If you have contracts with fish that bigger than you, get an attorney.<p>6) don't rely on free/cheap stuff from so-and-so's friend.  They could vanish and take your servers with them.",1225135567

If I wanted to be a founder of a startup but not be personally involved with the development myself, how likely is that to work? Does it happen more often than I assume already, or would it be a fairly weird structure?<p>Not asking just from a personal point of view... imagine someone thought of a new startup that has the potential to become absolutely huge, but they aren't able to build it themselves... how big a problem would it be?<p>Looking forward to hearing opinion.<p>edit: By ""non-technical founders"" I'm not talking about people who don't know the difference between two web browsers, but people who are technically savvy just not developers.",1281041928

One alternative hypothesis I have is this:<p>Google is a very able company, but it's core revenue comes from search advertising.<p>A company like Comcast will (sooner or later) be able to easily afford to build its own search engine that is <i>good enough</i>.  Microsoft did this with Bing, and who knows, MS or others could even do a special licensing deal with ISPs.<p>If a search company (Microsoft, or any of the variety of competitors) were able to score a non-neutrality deal with a few major ISPs, Google's bottom line would take a massive hit.<p>So all this talk of Google making videos play faster for everyone using a mobile network is a red herring.  The real issue is that most of Google's revenue comes from US search ads, and most of those ads are served via a small number of ISPs.<p>Fortunately for Google, the scale of running web search data centers has been so massive that there have been significant barriers to entry.<p>But as Microsoft showed, it's possible to build a search engine that is <i>every bit as good as Google</i> for 99% of users from scratch without any secret sauce, relatively quickly.<p>If you want a thought experiment, suppose Microsoft licensed Bing to Comcast at a 50/50 ad revenue split deal and Comcast offered its customers $20/month cheaper pricing to force all search traffic through Bing.  My guess is that  most customers wouldn't care too much, and I think Google realizes this and chose to put lots of energy into net neutrality under the guise of not being evil.",1281041771

(I just made those terms up but they seem to work nicely.)<p>Functionality and aesthetics are connected but I would argue that functional minimalism doesn’t have to lead to aesthetic minimalism.<p>Aesthetic minimalism is a specific look: a specific color palette, a specific set of fonts, a specific use of illustrations and photos, a specific use of geometries and space.<p>Some of those specific properties of aesthetic minimalism may indeed lead to better functionality like less distraction and better readability. Much of the rest of it is mostly fashion. There is a wider range of aesthetics with which your design can work and be functional — I would very much despise living in a world were all everyone ever wants to achieve is a minimalist look.<p>I would also argue that functional minimalism is always a laudable design goal, independent of your aesthetics. At least when your goal is designing something that people are supposed to use and not, say, art. (I should again emphasize that both are obviously connected. You can’t make your aesthetic choices independent of your functional choices, it’s just that there is a wider range of options than just aesthetic minimalism.)",1281041688

How much would institutions pay us for this?<p>From the pdf:<p>""The ABS issuer or the underwriter generally will have a computer model of the waterfall. However, the issuer or underwriter currently has no obligation to share the computer model with actual or potential ABS investors. Because prospective investors in ABS typically do not have access to the ABS issuer’s computer models, under current conditions, an investor must create its own computer program. It does this by taking the priority of payment rules stated in the trust agreement, pooling and servicing agreement, indenture, or other operative document for the ABS and described in the prospectus, converting the English language statement of those provisions into one or more algorithms, and then expressing the algorithms as computer code in a programming language. <i>As a practical matter, it is often not possible to complete these steps before making an investment decision.</i> This is particularly onerous for smaller institutional investors, for whom it may not be feasible to acquire the financial and technological expertise necessary to develop a computer program of the waterfall. Thus, investment decisions with respect to ABS may be made without the benefit of the investor performing its own quantitative valuation analysis. This may encourage undue reliance on the determinations of credit rating agencies. Further, there is the possibility that some investors will program the waterfall erroneously, leading to inaccurate ABS valuations.""",1281041053

1b. Rural America can cheat and bring economic leverage back to rural America by using technology and the internet (this post is an example of that).

   * Learn how to find information they need on google, and use that to be productive.

   * Do case studies on online businesses. Wine Library, Gizmondo, lifehacker, etc, etc.
   * Read the books Crush IT and Rework
   * Brain storm ideas and then get involved in communities/forums about what they think their business will be tangentially related to.  Develop relationships.

Class 3.<p><pre><code>   * Form Partnerships, Give out Shares to Advisors, etc, etc.
   * Write Marketing/Business Plan, Conduct Market Research.
   * Start to build their content based business.

It's almost a if he was making a political decision rather than a legal one.</i><p>The argument presented to the judge was exactly the basis you've pointed out: that the sole purpose of marriage is to encourage procreation and to provide a stable environment in which to raise children.<p>If you'd actually read the ruling, you'd know that the evidence presented for this was flimsy at best; it was not demonstrated that heterosexual parents do a better job of raising children than homosexual parents, and it was freely admitted that marriage licenses are granted to heterosexual couples who are unable or unwilling to procreate. Thus the argument was rejected as legally unproven, and the ban on homosexual marriage was found to have no legally acceptable basis.<p>(and again the parallels with racial bans are striking: it was argued, once upon a time, that interracial couples would produce inferior children and that the government thus had an interest in preventing such couples from marrying. Such arguments were similarly unproven, and ultimately unprovable)",1281040856

He observes that great (or greatly profitable) organizations, like Microsoft, have all set themselves what he calls a Big Hairy Audacious Goal, such as ""A computer on every desk and in every home"".

I've read The Little Lisper. I've read Lisp 1.5 Manual. I've written a Lisp interpreter in C. And so on. I'll use Lisp as long as I am still allowed to do so (I'm a grad student, so no issues yet!).<p>So I love Lisp and I love Clojure for being a new Lisp.<p>JoC talks directly to me. It references works and people I know about, but most of which I do not know enough about. It talks about how amazing Lisp is but tells me even more than I already knew. Much more. It's written as if the authors are saying, ""Yes of course Lisp and Clojure are great, but here are all the reasons WHY."" For example, the section ""nil Pun With Care"" is obviously written for someone who knows the variations on 'nil' found in different Lisps. JoC's style is similar to Rich Hickey's famous presentations (""Yes, nil is different in Clojure... ok, let's just get through this slide, you knew we'd have to at some point..."").<p>JoC really takes Lisp appreciation to the next level.

So a rolling close with convertible notes may not be the best option from investor point of view - no?<p>(With an equity deal, the startup can get an exit until it goes out of business.  With a convertible notes deal, you have a fixed timeframe and you (as an early stage investor) lose out if the exit happens beyond that time period...<p>...So I thought one never did a convertible notes deal unless they knew there was a very very good chance of an exit within the specified time frame... am I missing something?<p>My point is - I don't see rolling closes with convertible notes getting too popular with most angels.)",1281038582

3590726,comment,3585640,3587862,0,0,cobrausn,,,"Discussing an artist whose music you've heard is in no way guaranteed to compensate that artist.  At best, someone, somewhere, will hear the word of mouth and spend some money that goes back in the direction of the artist.  There is no guarantee though - you end up hand-waving in a benefit when it cannot be proven that your piracy helped anything, though it can be proven that you didn't pay for what they are asking you to pay for as, currently, the means of profit is mostly tied to the distribution channels, not the production.  Saying 'they should have done things differently' and then pirating their music is a lot like blaming the victim.<p>Now, hearing their music and then going out and buying a CD / paying for a legal download / picking up some show tickets or t-shirts is a different story, and is the best possible outcome of piracy.  I'm not arguing against these people - these people are cool people, and are trying to affect a change in the system.  If more people did this, show and swag revenue would increase and reduce the dependency on the digital content distribution as a source of income, which might have a very meaningful impact on new artists when they see the example.<p>I'm not really going to address the 'social pariah' argument, because I've never been one nor do I know what it is like to be have friends that would 'shun' for the crime of not pirating music (not committing a crime?).  I will say that using the 'everyone is doing it argument' is not particularly constructive.<p>Games, IMHO, are a completely different animal in many respects, and since the only way to actually compensate the developer (currently) is to pay for the game, then I am actually about as hard-lined on this as it is possible to be - you shouldn't be playing the game if you haven't paid for it.  Steam is a great example of offering services in exchange for content restrictions, and is (IMHO) the reason PC gaming is still alive as anything other than an indie-playground.<p>My personal opinion is that PC games (in particular) are actually headed in the direction of always-on MMO-like behavior that requires an internet connection in order to be part of the game world, and this is by design.  I'm not necessarily talking Ubisoft's reprehensible always-on-even-during-singleplayer DRM, i'm talking about games that will act like MMOs in order to ensure the playerbase needs to be online in order to get most of the game.  Sure, you can play a gimped pirated version, but why would you?  All the good stuff is on their servers, which require authentication.<p>I will point out that despite the ease with which one could pirate a game like Skyrim, it still sold 2.8 million units in November alone.  Mostly, I'm sure, because people want to pay for the game, not because of anti-piracy measures... other than Steam, which I suppose counts as that.<p>So I guess what I am saying is that despite the fact that I will argue for the moral necessity of funding development of digital content by paying for it until such a time as the means of distribution is no longer the primary income source, I am unconvinced that piracy is such a huge problem that it requires anything more than prosecution of the most blatant violators and those that profit from it.",1329238740

But we're talking about digital information here.  You don't remove it from where you get it.  So if your only alternative is (illegal) copying vs abstinence, then I see little reason to restrain yourself.<p>Furthermore, I think it is unethical to forbid the use of, say, The Pirate Bay for copying stuff you couldn't have obtained otherwise.

Annoyingly, the biggest complaint from new parents was ""My kid already did this worksheet! Why are you giving it to him again?""<p>I had to explain that repetition was the most important part. You could explain the science but the parents don't seem to care about that part. The parents often thought that it was de-motivational and belittling to have to do the same work over again, so we often mentioned that revisiting something you've done before and acing it the second time around can actually boost confidence quite a bit (we would sometimes make a point of showing a kid that he might not have done so well with something a few months ago, and now he did it perfectly or nearly perfectly).<p>PS: 99.9999% of tutoring success depended on motivation. I could teach any kid in the world anything if he was motivated, regardless of his or her knowledge when they came to us. There were only two things I figured out about how to get kids motivated that weren't:<p>1. Enthusiasm is contagious. The tutor damn well better be excited about the subject. The environment better be positive, and sometimes that meant telling the parents to back off. Most parents I worked with were Indian/Chinese/strict. Most were extremely good and supportive, but some were really harsh.<p>2. Provable, tangible progress that you can show the kid. This is another reason repetition is so important, it's half of the motivation, even if the kid doesn't outwardly admit it.",1329238221

The Communist Manifesto is not founded in any reality (psychological, political, economic), and as it is applied but fails to bring the promised benefits as it is completely ungrounded in reality, it also encourages the leaders to come to the conclusion that the only reason this can be is that the people aren't trying hard enough. This requires a stronger centralized rule to fix the problem and force the people to comply, but strengthening the centralized rule just causes more problems because centralized rule doesn't work, and it certainly doesn't work with the horrifyingly wrong Communist economic model. This causes yet more centralized power to be amassed and yet more crackdowns, until it crumbles under its own weight.<p>It's utterly predictable, mostly because we've seen so many try to apply it and fail in exactly the same way each time. We're well past the point where we can say the Communist Manifesto directly leads to dictatorial regimes. I will recant this statement when someone manages to apply it without turning into a dictatorial regime, but don't hold your breath for that.",1329237675

China is a not a democracy at all. So comparing the education levels of elected officials isn't really an apples-to-apples comparison.<p>In the US, a person's charisma, ability to relate to and attract the attention of voters, ability to build a political organization and ability to get things done within the political system define your success as a politician. Politicians start local, and build tight social networks as city councilmen, mayors, state legislators, etc. They then use those networks to get into Federal offices.<p>The great exception are candidates that skip the political process and reach high office by spending prestige capital (ie. President/General US Grant) or by spending lots of financial capital (ie. New York City Mayor Bloomberg). Even in these cases, these folks are actually buying access to someone else's political infrastructure.<p>None of this means that the US government does not have scientists working on policy. Scientists do work for the government as political appointees (ie. Secretary Chu of the US Department of Energy), as civil servants (ie. employees of NOAA), as contractors to government (ie. the RAND Corporation), or indirectly via unaffiliated think-tanks (ie.

""magical"". It's like some CEO of a startup giving a deadline to the developer to write Hadoop in 4 hours; pulling the number out of thin air.<p>Compiler => helped syntax errors and types (95%, 5% consist of reflection hackery that might bite).<p>Static code analysis => One level up from syntax errors, focused on common pitfalls and bug patterns<p>One step, two step, three step, doesn't matter, it helps, that's the bottom line.<p>What I refer to ""except that happens as well in dynamic language"" is to the business logics, the app logics, not syntax and whatnot, you _got it wrong_. We all got business logics bugs that can't be caught by anything other than testing the app themselves (QA, automation, whatever).<p>So we agree that dynamic languages requires you to write more testing code because there's no compiler? Gotcha.<p>I never say anywhere that using a static language requires NO testing.<p>What I found is that a bunch of old-timers who wrote Java back in 98-2003 and didn't use more modern Java frameworks and tools but already jumped the band-wagon to Rails or Node.js keep singing the same tune.<p>When I use Rails, then Spring MVC + Spring Data, I noticed that the amount of business logics that I have to write is more or less the same. 10x is again out of thin-air. I admit writing code in Java requires more typing albeit Eclipse helps a lot (and please don't bring the old argument of ""But You need an IDE!"", who cares what I need as long as it helps me to do my job).<p>Picking one example to refute the epidemic that occurs in the ecosystem is probably not a strong argument (Rails is well maintained, I give you that, although it takes Rails up to version 3.x to realize that they need to cool down and stabilize but I give you that, but that doesn't mean the other plugins and libraries are held the same level of quality and commitment with Rails).",1329236294

If you come through positive for the test, what's the probability that you have the disease? Too many people think it's 99% (the converse of the false-positive rate); but in reality it's more like 10%. But you still formed a hypothesis, did a test, and the result came out OK.

Well, it's a very strange interface: a shell script you have to invoke (and hence spawn asynchronously from your C code), and it's not written to be extensible. It's an optional package in many distributions, and nothing we'd be happy to invoke as part of early boot in order to show a welcome message. (In times with sub-second userspace boot times we really don't want to invoke a huge shell script for a triviality like showing the welcome message). The lsb_release tool to us appears to be an attempt of abstracting distribution checks, where standardization of distribution checks is needed. It's simply a badly designed interface. In our opinion, it has its use as an interface to determine the LSB version itself, but not for checking the distribution or version.<p>And I guess distributions are far more reluctant to install a shell script than adding a file to /etc",1329235986

Sometimes for no apparent reason one of his displays doesn't get a signal after waking his laptop from sleep or hibernate, and the only way to resolve it is a reboot.<p>To make a long story short: we could exchange anecdotes all day about the state of 'Just Works' on Linux, but at the end of the day, I think no one with enough experience using various Linux distros and OS X, can honestly and sincerely say Linux is even close to OS X in that aspect.<p>Myself, I've been using Linux since Slackware 4 and have tried about 10 different distro's over time, alongside OS X for the last 5 years or so. Up to this day, I regularly run into problems that need fixing on Linux, particularly after upgrades, or when switching hardware. Whether it's Wifi cards, USB hardware, multi-monitor support, network configuration issues, software that stops working, system library problems: there's always something. OS X on 3 different machines, from OS X 10.4 through 10.7, I've only had one issue that required maintenance once, on a b0rked upgrade. It was pretty nasty, but fortunately OS X has Time Machine and target disk mode, so in no-time I was able to pull off any important data just to be sure, re-install the OS, restore my Time Machine backup, only to find out everything was back to normal, to the point I didn't even need the files I had to pull before the restore.",1329235762

People who got rich and successful outside of the bureaucratic system often become an object of envy by people inside the system, even if they will consciously deny it, which then leads to the perverted notion that the only way to make the world a fair place is to increase the reach of the bureaucracy.<p>Now, America was founded by intellectuals (though not of bureaucratic kind). The thing that distinguishes America from most other countries in the world is that in America one specific type of freedom is respected: ""freedom to rise"". In the old Europe people at the top were often members of aristocracy and it was obvious to everyone that they didn't have to work as hard as everyone else to get where they are. In America, people at the top were often (though I admit not always -- just more often than in Europe) the hardest-working, smartest, and toughest-minded individuals, and it was obvious to everyone that they got there on their own. Bureaucracy, in a way, is a lot like aristocracy (actually it is more like a medieval guild system), since it has its own system of ranks, and you can't easily get from one to the other just through working hard -- it has to be ""bestowed"" on you. Hence why Americans tend to disrespect bureaucracy, and, by the way, that is a very good thing.<p>EDIT: downvoted: time to leave Hacker News.",1329235669

Fingers are huge, relatively speaking, and for touch interfaces to make up for that fact they <i>must</i> get fewer bits out of the resulting input. The mathematics of signal processing require this. A stroke is much less definitive than a keystroke, or a mouse motion with click, etc. Moreover, you have the problem of interfering with output bandwidth as well as if you want to touch anything other than the very bottom of the screen you must obscure the screen with your hand while doing it for seconds at a time. You get less bandwidth both out and in.<p>What obscures this fact from your immediate recognition is that, unsurprisingly, touch interfaces are optimized to work under those circumstances, so you don't really ""feel"" the limitations, but you would if you really tried to push them the way a really good content creation application would.<p>For low-bandwidth applications they're fine, but they will never ever take over everywhere because they have weaknesses that make them unsuitable for high-precision, high-IO tasks.",1329235294

Within a small area you have independent nations with their own laws, currency, elections, etc. This represents less single points of failure IMO.<p>I think the early U.S also had a similar model. State's had their own currencies and regulations, with the right to over-rule federal regulations. Now, the US is essentially one state, one currency, and a giant single point of failure. Now the EU and the US are metastasizing in size/power and crushing anything that poses a threat to their authority.",1329235286

Give me Emacs, R and LaTeX working out of the box and available in easy downloads with no spaces in my paths, and I'm happy. I can understand that others may have different perspectives.<p>That being said, has he tried Emacs? As far as I know with GDB and gcc and flymake, pretty much everything he wants to do is available.",1329235242

You get this harness and can lock yourself into 300 feet long ropes in 30 feet heights and just fly from tree to tree. I'm sure, you can find them also in the US.

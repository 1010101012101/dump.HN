I have built and flown quadcopters the most. My most efficient configuration with high quality motors was very fast at about 50mph and could sustain that speed for 8-12 minutes depending on battery size, making the maximum distance 10 miles. Currently that is extremely far for a quad copter to fly. It could hover for about 18 minutes. The quad weights in at 3 lbs so adding another pound would drastically reduce its range. Cost to build this cheaply; Motors $200, long range tx/rx $350, flight controller w/ gps $70, ESCs $60, frame materials $60, battery $50, remote controller $50, wiring $10, props $60. This drone could be built for around $1k. It should be noted that while quads are more efficient they are also the most limited by payload. Ramping to a hex octo or deca would increase payload and potential battery size, and potentially flight time/distance, however efficiency tends to tick down.",1388845696

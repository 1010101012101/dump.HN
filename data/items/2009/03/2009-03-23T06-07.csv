I mean, your essays date back before YC.<p>So in my mind, advising this group during the acquisition offer, even if there was a chance you would miss out, is showing a true adherence to some kind of ethical/moral code.<p>That's true integrity, in my opinion.",1237791597

Perhaps it'll look better when I get back on my desktop but on this 1024 pixel width netbook it's just a smush of poorly separated text.<p>Anyway, it's not that important, I guess. They have good products and a supportive userbase. They don't need a slick site to sell what they have.. and if you look at the sites of most Fortune 500 companies, they're usually poorly designed so perhaps they're aiming for that club.",1237791399

It's one of the things that is recognisable by your parents, maybe even grandparents. Wouldn't it be simpler, instead of trying to build out @handle usage, to add more control to emails?

Gmail has fantastic filters already, a bit of a pain to set up but they work. Wouldn't an improvement on those be better?",1237790462

528148,comment,528113,528113,0,0,patio11,,,"You don't need ""dynasty wealth"" to manage property.  It is one of the most common small businesses in the United States.  (Fairly low capital requirements by the standards of physically-extant businesses, low expertise requirements, well within the capability of many middle class families.)  It also has <i>significant risk</i> and requires <i>lots of manual labor</i>.  (That is why I don't do it.  You can outsource the manual labor but that ends up outsourcing the positive part of the cash flow, too.)<p>Risks:<p>+ Property prices fall.<p>+ Competitive options for housing in vicinity of your property decline in price, causing rent you can charge to fall.  For example: if you can buy a modest house in Detroit for $10,000 why would any worthwhile prospective renter pay you the $500 a month you need to cover the mortgage and maintenance on the modest home you bought back when Detroit had viable industries in it?<p>+ Can't find a tenant, get to eat mortgage.<p>+ Renters trash house, enjoy $20,000 repair bill.<p>+ Renters stop paying rent.  Enjoy eviction process.<p>+ Your local government decides evil landlords are exploiting poor people to make money, institutes rent control.  Enjoy low rents, impossibility to unload property on another sucker, etc.",1237789271

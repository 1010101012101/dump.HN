Not cynical mockery.<p>And the culture of vapid celebrity that sells magazines/TV/movies doesn't sell tech. Even the Facebook/MySpace masses could hardly care less about gossip of those companies' founders and executives. At best, such gossip is industry 'inside baseball'... and so it should be judged for accuracy and relevance, not snark and salaciousness.",1226652063

I hope Boutin, the one byline most consistently puckish rather than nasty, continues to find other outlets. But overall I'm glad Valleywag is folding; it leaked an unhealthy amount of sewage into the intertubes.",1226651254

Their assignment is to sell Duncan Hines brownie mix, but they spend a lot of their time just rewriting memos. They are clearly smart - one has just graduated from Harvard, the other from Dartmouth - but that doesn't distinguish them from a slew of other new hires at P&G.<p>What does distinguish them from many of the young go-getters the company takes on each year is that neither man is particularly filled with ambition. Neither has any kind of career plan. Every afternoon they play waste-bin basketball with wadded-up memos. One of them later recalls, ""We were voted the two guys probably least likely to succeed.""<p>These two young men are of interest to us now for only one reason: They are Jeffrey Immelt and Steven Ballmer, who before age 50 would become CEOs of two of the world's most valuable corporations, General Electric (GE, Fortune 500) and Microsoft (MSFT, Fortune 500).

I personally get better mileage from building the core architecture/functionality first, and working on the rest, ideally with public feedback on both after a certain stage. I've made significant changes in usability in the past as a result of this. If you end up hard-coding stuff before it gets scrutinized in the forge of actual use, you'll have a harder time making changes down the road.<p>YMMV. It helps if you use a framework or something else that can get you started. Just remember that customizing a framework isn't your core competency.",1226650953

364092,comment,363094,363977,0,0,curiousgeorge,,,"I don't know about English acquisition, but your timeline is way off for Chinese language acquisition, even for younger children brought to China. An aggressive timeline for adults in-country would be about 2 years to conversational fluency, and less for younger kids. This is more or less the pace you see for the faster Korean learners who come to China.<p>I'm happy you've had a good experience in Australia. You should remember that the barriers to learning English and Chinese are fundamentally different. English requires  mastery of about 100 phenomes before reading and writing skills reinforce each other and learning accelerates: the language gets more difficult as you get better. In contrast, the difficulty curve for Chinese is steep when you start but gets much easier as you improve.<p>Working hard is important, but equally important is giving yourself the tools to maximize learning. Someone struggling to get through Dream of the Red Chamber with a traditional dictionary is at a huge disadvantage to someone using the proper tools and resources. Learning a language is like engineering in the sense that one should use the best tools for the job, and then put in the time needed to execute.",1226650333

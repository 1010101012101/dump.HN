Eg. a few of my local sources have missing diacritics. I'd love to contribute that small fix back, but can't.<p>This way you can also allow your readers to notify you of bad/broken links (ok, you can handle that if you're going to get the rss feeds) or anything else that may happen over time, so you don't need to worry about it, just look it up if reported.<p>Also, thank you for not requiring my exact location to be able to suggest (correctly) where I am.

There are async librarys in lots of languages you can use them if you have a problem that suits the async modle but you can use other models to if they are better.<p>The other thing with node is that it is single threaded do do multicore you have to use process witch are slow in communicating. This could work now because we often only use quadcores but in the next years we will have many many more. Is it a solution to start node up for say 16, 80 or 1000 cores?<p>Im not ranting on node I hear it works fine for some stuff but the benchmarks that got everybody so exited in the beginning was not really that practical.<p>If I write a low level it might be fast because it maps to the C stuff good but if I write a big application with lots of layers of JS will it still be fast? (I know that V8 is getting better but it there jet for big server applications?).<p>Hope somebody can talks about this.",1299747534

However, a poor library can certainly drag an OK language down to poor.<p>One of the most complicated decisions in developing any new programming language today must surely be where to draw the line separating standard library facilities from those to be provided externally. Provide too little, and you get a zillion incompatible external implementations popping up (C++ and strings; JavaScript and DOM manipulations). On the other hand, go too far, and you get your entire community relying on mediocre facilities, or worse, multiple competing facilities in your own standard (Java and GUIs; D in general). Likewise, if you have a common repository for additional libraries, you can be too restrictive on contributions and wind up with many basics still not covered (C++ and Boost) or you can be too open and wind up with a whole load of substandard or incomplete junk (Perl and CPAN).",1299747188

This was written in 2002, and the author's tenure at Google was 2000-2001.  That was pre-BigTable, I think it was pre-MapReduce, and it may even have been pre-GFS.  Plus, Google's known for it's NIH syndrome - while there are a fair number of third-party libraries in use <i>now</i>, there weren't really in Google's codebase of 2000, which had just dumped many of the early frameworks they'd used for prototypes.<p>Rather, I think this is more evidence of the old ""Good programmers will be productive in any language.""  The advantage that an expressive programming language like Lisp gives you is that it frees you to think about the problem domain and not worry too much about the details of the machine.  However, if you're skilled enough that you've pushed those details into unconscious muscle memory, they don't matter anyway.  And a language like C++ gives you the <i>option</i> of dropping down to the bare metal if the need arises.<p>There are a fair number of Lispisms in early Google code - MapReduce is the obvious one, and there're others that I'm not at liberty to discuss.  However, they're Lispisms implemented in C++, where the author took the concept and transplanted them into a language that could give the efficiency needed.  This is not a bad strategy - when you understand the concept fully, you're free to tweak it and adapt it exactly as necessary for your problem.<p>Perhaps not coincidentally, many early Googlers were also programming language & compiler guys before Google.  Urs Hoezle (employee #9 and Google's first VP) had previously done StrongTalk (statically-typed SmallTalk), Self (the prototypical prototype-based language and an early inspiration for JavaScript), and the VM that later became Java HotSpot.  Jeff Dean got his Ph.D on the Cecil/Vortex compiler, one of the first optimized implementations of CLOS-like multimethods.  Rob Pike worked on Plan9 at Bell Labs and invented the Limbo programming language as part of it.",1299746908

ALL banner advertising would be affected by this change. All ad servers use cross domain cookie tracking of some kind. If not to track user behaviour, its (for example) to track impressions to make sure that you dont show the same ad to the same user more than a set number of times. That is also a 3rd party cookie.<p>Without that ability it will be hard (impossible?) to rate limit campaigns to users, thus increasing the cost effectiveness to the advertiser and eventually hurting publishers as advertising money is diverted elsewhere.<p>In short, this rule would affect ALL banner adverts on all sites.

If you break down the PISA scores by state, the three lowest performing states are Mississippi, New Mexico, and West Virginia. While Mississippi has a huge black population, New Mexico is only 2% black and West Virginia is only 3%. While New Mexico is 44% hispanic, West Virginia is almost entirely white non-hispanic. One thing these three states have in common, though, is that they are all very poor.<p>There is definitely a correlation between a higher population of blacks and lower test scores. But there is also a strong correlation between higher rates of poverty and lower test scores, and a very large number of hispanics and blacks are poor.<p>Black students in Massachusetts perform much better than black students in Mississippi. Virginia, which is nearly 20% black, is one of the top-performing states, while West Virginia, which is 96% white, is near the bottom.<p>While the US is richer than most of Europe, our income inequality means that we have a much higher poverty rate.

2308556,comment,2307532,2308119,0,0,andresmh,,,"The Khan Academy is not <i>the</i> future of education.  Don't get me wrong, I think they're doing a superb job and I'd encourage people to contribute to their efforts. Khan is obviously a great presenter with a remarkable ability to explain complex concepts using a new medium. However, the future of education is closer to hacker culture than it is about new and better content delivery mechanisms. Let me explain.<p>First, I totally buy the argument that a YouTube video can be a better method of delivering content than a book or even, as Kahn says, a live teacher. However, learning is much more than that. Learning is about imagining, playing, creating, sharing and reflecting (Resnick 2007, PDF: <a href=""http://j.mp/gqnc6f"" rel=""nofollow"">http://j.mp/gqnc6f</a>).<p>To say that learning math is about watching a video and drilling on some problem set, is like saying that learning Python is about doing a tutorial and solving some exercises. <i>Hackers know this well</i>. You don't really learn a programming language until you build some  project, especially a personally meaningful one. Creating something not only helps you learn the language but also its community, culture,  practices, how to ask questions and get feedback on your work.<p>Think about it, would you rather hire a developer that has finished some tutorials or one that has actually hacked some projects? The same logic applies to most other fields. Artists and scientists know this as well: you learn by doing in the social context of a community.<p>Unfortunately, schooling has taken the ""hacking"" away from learning and has focused on improving content delivery, artificial problem-solving and test-taking. Often using technology. I liked when he mentioned that the teachers have more time to mentor students. However, their mentoring is most likely still focused on the artificial and decontextualized approach of traditional schooling.<p>Initiatives like the Khan Academy will probably play a role in the future but to really improve education the system and the approaches should change. One should look at exemplar learning environments like the hacker communities or even the Brazilian Samba schools. Settings that are ""real, socially cohesive and where experts and novices are learning"" (Papert 1980, Google Books: <a href=""http://j.mp/dLNbGG"" rel=""nofollow"">http://j.mp/dLNbGG</a>).<p>In 1971, Ivan Illich outlined an inspirational alternative educational environment where ""the child grows up in a world of things, surrounded by people who serve as models for skills and values. He finds peers who challenge him to argue, to compete, to cooperate, and to understand; and if the child is lucky, he is exposed to confrontation or criticism by an experienced elder who really cares.""<p>Illich said that the four resources learners need are ""things, models, peers, and elders"". In his 1971 vision, Illich said that ""the operation of a peer-matching network would be simple. The user would identify himself by name and address and describe the activity for which he sought a peer. A computer would send him back the names and addresses of all those who had inserted the same description. It is amazing that such a simple utility has never been used on a broad scale for publicly valued activity""(<a href=""http://j.mp/hNUVV8"" rel=""nofollow"">http://j.mp/hNUVV8</a>). Sounds familiar? When I read Illich, I think of HN, StackExchange, and the larger ecology of spaces that hackers have created around social learning. My hope is that these and other similar approaches scale up and get adopted more broadly along with resources like the Khan Academy, OCW and others.",1299745269

1122440,comment,1122361,1122361,0,0,justrudd,,,"I develop on a MacBook Pro with a Apple Cinema Display hooked up to it.  I've tried both VMWare Fusion and Bootcamp.  When in Fusion, the only thing running is Visual Studio.  I turn off everything - Aero, sound, etc.  It runs fine for the most part.  I use a dark color scheme and sometimes scrolling through code shows some lag.  It isn't as pronounced now since I turned off Aero and what not, but does still show up every once and awhile.<p>I also use CodeRush and Refactor! Pro.  It does a lot redrawing of the core Visual Studio environment (highlights, animated arrows, etc.).  Most of them work.  But I have noticed cases where they don't redraw properly when running under Fusion.<p>Now depending on the types of solutions you develop, you might not like Fusion.  I do a mixture of desktop apps and web apps.  The desktop apps work the same on the VM as they do in a non-VM install.  The difficulty is that to get the performance I wanted, I turned off Aero, sound, etc.  So your app isn't really what your clients are seeing.  For web apps, it doesn't really matter.<p>The other thing I've notice is that sometimes WPF doesn't do an initial rendering under a VM.  I have to resize the window just a smidge to get it to draw.  Now this is only showing up in WinForm apps that display a WPF dialog.  So maybe it is the WPF being hosted in a Winform under a VM that is causing it :)<p>Each thing taken alone is negligible to me.  But add them all up, I just started using the Bootcamp partition exclusively.  I get all the ""prettiness"" of Win7, my apps look like what my users will see, etc.<p>The biggest problem I have with Win7 is the apps just aren't as nice.  I think Trillium is bloated compared to Adium.  Pidgin works on Win7, but you can tell it's a GTK app.  On Mac OS X, I used Gabble for Yammer.  Windows doesn't have a native Yammer app except that stupid AIR app.  And on principle I won't install Adobe AIR.<p>1Password is nicer than KeePass, Password Manager, or whatever Win password you use (if you use one).<p>iBank is nice (but not great) on the Mac considering I won't use Quicken and Microsoft Money has been discontinued.",1266029883
1122439,comment,1122409,1122409,0,0,ryanelkins,,,"I found it to be surprisingly accurate for myself. I never took the official quiz but I usually come out as either an INTP or INTJ. It seems that last slot is a close call for me. After reading over both types, INTP is the most accurate. I think it's up to most people to find where they best ""fit"" and that will be more difficult for each ""category"" for lack of a better word if they aren't definitively one way or the other.<p>So knowing that, now what? Well, I've tried using it to understand the general process of how others think and better understand how I myself think. I'm prone to introspection and I do find that many of the attributes of the INTP match my own personality. It gives me a handle on what sorts of things I should watch out for and helps me to recognize why I tend to do better in some areas. I think like any tool it's success will depend largely on how it's used.",1266029860

THIS IS HARD. i don't care what any old salty dog mail admin tells you, it is an arduous process to properly manage the filtering and blocking and unblocking etc of mail. for a small site, getting aol or yahoo to unblock your ip range may be a great feat. for a large site, 90% of your traffic will be spam and getting every legitimate mail is nearly impossible without subjecting your users to tons of crap.<p>the cost in money and time just to host some free webmail yourself is astronomical in comparison to putting up with an ad and a possible privacy violation from a free provider like yahoo or gmail. if you want your mail handled properly, pay a big e-mail provider to host it for you, or spend a lot moree time and money to do the same thing yourself.",1266027853

I might have a robot read every personal email I get to my entire household and I wouldn&#x27;t need to disclose that to every person that sends me email.<p>I can forward all of them to a virtual personal assistant in Mumbai and have them deal with it all, just sending me a daily summary and maybe writing some auto-responses for me, and there&#x27;d be no need for me to disclose that fact to every person that writes me an email.<p>You can do the same thing with physical mail as well...there are services that can receive your mail, scan it, and send me stuff that seems relevant. No need for people to be able to figure out that you&#x27;re doing that.<p>The fact is that I can contract that sort of thing out however I like. It&#x27;s my mail once I receive it. I think it should be required for students to be protected when they have to use an email system when attending a school, so go ahead and get a firm statement from google on that, but the main part of this class action, the people sending email to people with gmail addresses, are barking up the wrong tree.",1395226788
7427804,comment,7427542,7427661,11,0,vidarh,,,"I&#x27;m Norwegian, and I think a lot of people don&#x27;t realise how big of a deal this feeling of security can be. I left university to do a startup. It happened literally over the course of a week: We decided we wanted to start an ISP, wrote a business plan, found an angel investor, rented offices that we moved into (as in, we lived in rooms in the office) and got started.<p>While I was certainly willing to take bigger risks then, with no dependents, <i>at no point</i> did things like healthcare or my ability to get food or shelter enter into my considerations, and the extremely low risks for us involved in potential failure made the decision process for deciding to go for it very different on a personal level from the ones I&#x27;ve been involved in later, in the UK and US.<p>We did live on tiny amounts of money for the following two years - the first year we financed with our student loans, while still notionally studying. But the prospect of the business failing and leaving me destitute and without access to healthcare, for example, were not really <i>possible</i>. My worst case prospect of going on social benefits for a while would in fact quite possibly have <i>raised</i> my living standards above how I was living out of choice to try to get the business off the ground.<p>In retrospect, it&#x27;s a fantastic level of freedom to have to never really have to worry about being put in any truly awful situation. I didn&#x27;t really realise until I moved to the UK - while the healthcare system here measures up well with the Scandinavian systems, most other things are far less generous here (and contrary to what most people think, I don&#x27;t pay all that much less tax than I did in Norway)",1395226748

Seems a bit redundant to me.<p>In some languages, like Common Lisp, nil and false are the same thing. However, it can be useful to separate the &quot;this is a false value&quot; from &quot;this value does not exist&quot;, specially in a dynamically typed language.<p>For example, in Lua you get a &quot;nil&quot; if you access a table field that does not exist and you delete a table field if you store null to it. Before they added a separate boolean type, it was really annoying to work with boolean arrays because storing nil in the array would make it full of holes and would confuse most library functions.",1395226738

Their current prototypes don&#x27;t do that anymore, and they&#x27;re still a year away from launch. Oculus is worried Sony didn&#x27;t solve that. Sony just announced the device will use LCD instead of OLED. Oculus picked OLED for its low persistence which greatly reduces the nausea effect. We&#x27;ll see. Sony&#x27;s device is probably coming out next year, too.<p>And no, I think most VR PS4 games will be made at 720p@60fps. You might see some indie ones at 1080p. PS4&#x27;s hardware is barely enough for VR, but should be sufficient for a decent experience. The worst part about it is that Sony won&#x27;t be able to upgrade it until PS5, while Oculus will move on to 4k displays in a few years, 120Hz, better optics, and so on.",1395226677

Some (if not most) of the problems author describes would be a non-problem should he live in some of the more prosperous EU countries, so strictly speaking they are not linked to author&#x27;s profession.<p>Few hints he gives in the description of the interview process (&quot;you&#x27;ll be asked about algorithms&quot;, &quot;you&#x27;ll be asked why aren&#x27;t you a CTO&quot;, etc) imply that he&#x27;s interviewing for &quot;Just A Programmer&quot; positions -- is this the case? It looks like most of the difficulty in finding a job came from the disconnect between the position the author was applying for and his experience. JAP positions, even if they are advertised as &quot;senior&quot; normally require just the basic coding skills (i.e. you don&#x27;t have to be really smart, mediocre is just fine) and therefore majority of applications will be much younger than the author, thus forcing the HR to ask the questions above.<p>In a broader context of discussion about older developers, what&#x27;s more interesting for me are two things:<p>1. Why there are so few roles being advertised for truly senior developers? There are plenty of complicated commercial software around. For example, Apple works on a novel mobile operating system with its own set of technical challenges, so I would expect kernel specialists to be in demand, but those openings are rarely visible (even at apple.com/jobs).<p>2. What do truly senior engineers employed by major companies do on a daily basis? How mere mortals like us can get closer to their expertise set? I&#x27;m talking about Guido van Rossum at Dropbox, Brian Goetz at Oracle, Michael Stonebraker (though I&#x27;m not sure he hasn&#x27;t moved to academia full-time), etc.",1395226548

But there are lots of mosquitos in Scandinavia.<p>For instance, the health care is a centralised system. Those never work. Doctors don&#x27;t have time/incentive to diagnose problems unless they are obvious (or you&#x27;re related to a politician -- yes, like in Soviet). Many Swedes (how many? No one knows) drag easily cured problems around for years and decades.<p>From my own and friends&#x27; experiences -- simple knee problems that stopped favorite exercise, lack of iron/vitamines that gave depressions, hard to recognize allergies that resulted in tiredness, thyroid problems etc.<p>I am here to tell you Scandinavians that <i>it doesn&#x27;t have to be like that!</i><p>If you go into a health care place in Romania, you are a valued customer they want to make happy. They will screw you over by giving you extra tests, not telling you something (anything) to get you out the door (because they only have minutes with any given client)!<p>You can&#x27;t get that for money in Sweden. If you have health care problems, go to East Europe or something for the next vacation. (A recent article on BBC discussed that Polish doctors were working in Britain, because Polish immigrants were spoiled with the health care and the British system seemed similar to Sweden).<p>Please remember this when you&#x27;re too chronically tired to make enough fuss so the doctors will try to find your problem to get rid of you.<p>(I have experience with the Swedish and partly with the Finnish health care systems, e.g. the Norwegian is a bit different but I don&#x27;t really know enough to have an opinion.)",1395226178
7427769,comment,7427542,7427542,1,0,netcan,,,"foreword: this is not a statement of political or moral judgment. Just musings.<p>Part of the parcel of a dynamic competition based job market is that people get as much as possible of the total that others are willing to pay for their work. At present this means rapidly improving wages for certain categories of tech jobs where employees are scarce.<p>There are lots of ways this can go right or wrong. Here is a middle of the road story:<p>A family member of mine was a programmer in the mid 80s. By the 90s he had moved into management in a big enterprise software company. By mid 00s he was managing very big clients/projects that were billing for big software and thousands of engineering hours.  The last time he had really programmed for a living, it was in COBOL and even then the tech was dated and very specialized.<p>At some point the clients he was working on went onto a different model handled by a different division of the company in a different country. He was offered a relocation, but it did not appeal. He had kids in high school, etc. About 50 years old.<p>He had made good money for years but not rockstar money. He owned a valuable house and had savings and investments so he could last a year or two unemployed. His first next job was at a startup-like thing that petered out. Then a long period trying to make his way freelancing and applying for jobs paying far less than his last. Now he runs a business. I still imagine it&#x27;s far from his peek salary, but it&#x27;s definitely not a bad income by general standards. It can just be tricky adjusting especially if you had to use savings to bridge for a few years.<p>There are all sorts of ways of looking at this. For me the lesson I got from it is that we have a strange assumption: <i>your salary will go up over time and peek near retirement</i>. Realistically one person might earn more in total by the age of 45 than his neighbor earns by 65, even in after tax earnings. I imaging you can find those neighbors in almost any street.<p>The richer neighbor could theoretically retire at 45 at the same retirement income the other would have at 65. On paper it might be easier even though the richer younger neighbor has longer to live of his retirement savings. He also had 20 year to spend out of his lifetime earnings so there would be more in the piggy bank if they lived the same lifestyle. At 45 it&#x27;s a lot easier to supplement your retirement income and medical expenses are lower. Obviously this rarely happens.<p>Wealth is in a very real way relative to standards you consider normal.  Part of that normality standard is an expectation for rising income throughout your life.",1395226152

Maybe the fact that compilers default to optimisations <i>disabled</i> (and generate horribly redundant code), and a lot of binaries that are released seem to get compiled this way, has something to do with it.<p>> It&#x27;s almost as if there is some compiler-writers-protection-racket out there that threatens anyone who doesn&#x27;t bow to the powers of the modern compiler.<p>A lot of it seems to come from the &quot;religious belief in abstraction&quot; that is prevalent among academics; the belief that somehow, a &quot;higher level&quot; solution is always better.<p>> The wonder isn&#x27;t that they generate perfect code (by and large, they don&#x27;t), but that they can optimize as well as they do without introducing bugs left and right.<p>It&#x27;s not so surprising when you consider that compilers are just following patterns/transformations when they generate or optimise code, and these patterns are designed to be very general so they work for all cases, even when they&#x27;re not the most efficient way to do it in some of these cases. When a human is writing the Asm there is (or should be -  otherwise you&#x27;d be better off just using a compiler) a higher level of thought, a different process, one that may be more prone to errors but one that also shows some form of <i>creativity</i> - thinking about the specific application and, understanding that, applying a transformation/pattern that is only applicable in that case to improve the generated code.<p>Size optimisation is also another area where even a novice Asm programmer can very easily beat a compiler due to this general/specific pattern-ness divide. From what I&#x27;ve seen, compilers start with often overly-general code-generating patterns to produce initially unoptimised output, and then attempt to remove unnecessary instructions; while a human would not have this generality - because the human knows more about the specific problem - and the &quot;first-cut&quot; of code he/she writes is already more specific than the compiler&#x27;s.<p>(Not that I&#x27;m against compilers in general - I would very much like them to generate better code, but for that to happen there is likely going to have to be large changes in how they&#x27;re written and how the whole process of compilation is thought of. Trying to make a compiler &quot;think&quot; like a human is a good first step...)",1395224718

There are lots of reasons that people might cheat in classes that they enjoy or that they recognize is useful. I&#x27;ve been lucky enough to have very little cheating in my classes, but it&#x27;s easy enough to imagine.<p>Let&#x27;s say Johnny wants to be a doctor more than anything in the world. He knows that he needs two semesters of Organic Chemistry on his transcript to get in to med school, and that if his grades aren&#x27;t top notch he won&#x27;t be able to compete. Johnny likes his Chem prof (and the grading is fair), but he&#x27;s only managing B-&#x27;s on his exams. He sees his dream fading away. Sure, he could say, &quot;Huh. I guess I&#x27;m not cut out to be a doctor.&quot; But don&#x27;t you think some students out there would consider cheating under those circumstances?<p>Or maybe Johnny consciously chose to go to a college that has a strong culture of giving students a &quot;well-rounded&quot; education (by whatever internal definition) and insists that students take a wide variety of classes from different disciplines. That&#x27;s not Johnny&#x27;s cup of tea: he just wants a computing degree. He could easily have chosen a different school, but he didn&#x27;t. Now he just wants to focus on his CS classes, so when he&#x27;s stuck with a course in English or History he decides to cheat so he doesn&#x27;t have to think about it.

They&#x27;re &#x27;yet another frontend guy&#x27; to, for example, those who write Java servers. Guess what, those writing the Java servers are &#x27;just end-users&#x27; as far as the JVM hackers are concerned. Likewise, the JVM hackers are &#x27;just end-users&#x27; for the OS developers. The OS developers are &#x27;just end-users&#x27; for the hardware guys. The hardware guys are &#x27;just making an interchangable commodity&#x27; as far as the sysadmins are concerned, as they virtualise everything away. And, of course, the frontend devs laugh at the sysadmins for not being programmers.<p>You might think of some Node.js guy as a demi-god, but I&#x27;ve never heard of him since I don&#x27;t particularly care about Node.js. Likewise there were a lot of tributes being paid recently to a Ruby developer who passed away. It&#x27;s touching to see how many people he&#x27;d positively impacted, but again, I&#x27;ve never heard of him because I don&#x27;t particularly care about Ruby.<p>Am I an &#x27;imposter&#x27; since I don&#x27;t care about these things? Not at all. I have a high-level knowledge of what they are, and I even played around with Node.js a bit (unfortunately it was just after 0.4 had broken compatibility with most libraries in NPM!), but I can&#x27;t go too far down those rabbit holes because they&#x27;re not the stacks I use. Likewise, I don&#x27;t expect those who are deeply into Node.js and Ruby to care about, for example, the recent death of John Reynolds, or Robert Harper&#x27;s kidney transplant.<p>Just stick with the rabbit hole you&#x27;ve chosen, as long as you&#x27;re enjoying it; let the work of others guide you down, and if you reach the bottom you&#x27;ll suddenly find yourself to be a &#x27;Real Programmer&#x27; who can help with the digging. Alterntively, if you disagree with or don&#x27;t understand some of the decisions/conventions on the way then you should absolutely start digging in your own direction, even if it doesn&#x27;t go anywhere.<p>PS: Knowing APIs inside-out does not make one a &#x27;Real Programmer&#x27;. My day job is PHP, but I still tend to Google the most basic built-in functions (which, admittedly, is an artefact of PHP&#x27;s poor API). You should instead strive to understand your <i>problem</i> inside-out, from multiple perspectives, then you can pick and choose any API/stack you like and let the docs guide you through the tedious act of plumbing it all together.

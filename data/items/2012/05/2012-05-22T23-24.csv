Don't make assumptions that just because the founders are successful people that the company will be successful either.<p>Evaluate the same things a VC would look at - how does the founding team fit, what is the revenue model, burn rate, marketing strategy, who do they plan on staffing, what kind of investment do they have already, plans for raising another round etc. Don't be shy with these questions - the founders want you to trust them and be a part of the team and you have a right to know the answers.<p>Basically don't base your decision on a gut feeling and some ad hoc criteria, think like an investor before you invest.",1337731095

Right out of the gate, you are hit with the one-two punch of different texture compression formats being supported on different devices combined with a maximum APK size on Google's store. The only standard Android texture format with compression is ETC which doesn't support alpha. So right at square one, if you want to use compressed textures for maximum performance and resolution, you have to release 3 separate APK's with a different supports-OpenGL-texture tag in each manifest. One for DXT, one for PVRTC, and one for ATC. Or dynamically download megabytes of textures after detecting which GPU you are running on.<p>That's a sharp contrast with iOS's unified, simple developer story: all PVRTC without any maximum app size.",1337731038

4010741,comment,4010711,4010711,9,0,NateLawson,,,"This is an excellent proposal for an SSL extension to solve the problem of rogue CAs. It's by Trevor Perrin (a former co-worker and great crypto engineer) and Moxie Marlinspike, from Whisper Systems (now Twitter).<p>The way it works is simple. The admin for a site signs a message that ""pins"" a given public key to the domainname. This message is delivered by an SSL extension or appended to the SSL cert chain (a hack, but requires no protocol changes).<p>The pin message states that the public key won't change for a given period. If it changes, a rogue CA has issued a different cert and you are under attack. The browser will reject the session.<p>The admin can ""break"" the pin early by signing another message, distributed the same way. Then they can re-pin a new cert. This allows certificate mobility, fully under the control of each site admin.<p>This accomplishes the same goal as whole-cert pinning (as practiced in Chrome), but with many advantages. First, when you pin the cert (not public key), you don't allow for CA mobility. So if you keep the same server key but get a new cert, this appears to be an attack. Second, you have to notify Google and wait for them to issue a browser update when you do get a new cert. This is complicated and too costly.<p>Whole-cert pinning is used extremely rarely (not even all top 500 sites) and will never gain widespread adoption.<p>TACK is an extremely simple protocol, and the messages are tiny. It is very well-designed, and the site has working code on Github in addition to the Internet draft.<p>Trevor and Moxie are doing great things, so please do all you can to support them in this. It really is one of the few initiatives in recent times to have a huge impact on your family's actual security, as well as dissidents in countries like Iran.",1337730916

The result: I underperformed on the problem, and got walked out, leaving me feeling like the fool.  My new rule (and this goes for general life too): I call people's bad behavior, but not in a judgmental way, but rather to avoid adding a negative dynamic as a kernel to the relationsihp (e.g., in a meeting, I speak up if someone could interpret something poorly, to clarify it, because otherwise some subset of the people will be passive agressive and fume and suffer a downward spiral, rather than speak up themselves).

The 'other guy' had no relation with him, he simply met a nice girl and wanted to have a good time. The girl was in a relation with him; he should be angry at her!<p>When I enter a restaurant, I see a price on the menu and this is what I intend to pay. When I order the food, this is my agreement with the restaurant: pay what is asked. The server might be angry at me for not giving any tip, but as with the previous example, I have nothing to do with any contract the restaurant owner and the server might have. He accepted to work for a given salary. I might give a little extra if there's a parade for me or something, but not for just doing your job.",1337728075

How can someone simultaneously claim that they understand an algorithm well enough to know when best to apply it (and when to modify it!) and also admit that they can't actually implement it.<p>If you can't muddle through a basic implementation of mergesort 45 minutes, I can't believe that you are actually in a position to know when mergesort is a good or bad option, and certainly not that you are capable of writing a custom version for some domain-specific needs.<p>If someone wants to claim that it's simply not necessary to know mergesort, that's a reasonable stance (though I disagree). But to claim to truly understand it without being able to implement it seems like a bit of a fib.",1337728062

It takes even longer to replace a fired employee, as you either scrap what they were working on or you try to get their replacement to pick up where they left off.<p>More friction in hiring and firing results in more careful hiring practices.

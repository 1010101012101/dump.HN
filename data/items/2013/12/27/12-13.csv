6970444,comment,6970198,6970416,10,0,jamii,,,"I think that a big part of the problem is pervasive access to global state. Given a block of code, it&#x27;s impossible to tell what effect it (or its sub-calls) might have on the global state.<p>A common design pattern in clojure is to have a single massive data-structure that represents all application state, but to take it apart recursively whilst updating so that each function is only passed the pieces of state that are relevant. That way you can look at a function and immediately know what it can and can&#x27;t read/write out of the global state.<p>A nice way of doing this in an imperative language might be to pass bits of the global data structure by reference (ala lenses) so that a given function can only read/write state contained in its arguments. The data is still global in the sense that it is all accessible from the root object and is not encapsulated, but access can be restricted on a per-function basis.",1388149123

Let&#x27;s say they&#x27;re giving away Chromebooks because a) they wish to do good in the world, <i>and</i> b) they&#x27;d like to get more people using Google services, and this seems like a rather effective method of gaining long-term users. Now, ignoring the fact that you can indeed use crouton, enable dev mode, or otherwise &quot;hack the platform&quot; so to speak, where&#x27;s the actual issue in having these kids using Google services? Google&#x27;s offering them <i>free computers.</i> Does we honestly think that a poor kid in India wouldn&#x27;t eagerly give written consent to become a user of Google&#x27;s services, letting Google benefit from that as they do from any similar user, <i>especially</i> when they&#x27;re not being forced in any way whatsoever to continue doing so in the future?<p>I&#x27;m a goddamn middle-class American, I believe I have a reasonable knowledge of what Google will get out of this deal (as they do every day from my heavy usage of their services), and <i>I</i> would accept the free computer. Even at that, poor kids without regular access to the internet aren&#x27;t your average highly tech-literate, open-source-aware HN user, and I really doubt they care about Google&#x27;s relatively responsible* use of collected information in exchange for a rather nice free netbook, even if they <i>were</i> fully aware of its implications.<p>*Sure, I understand this is an arguable definition, but in the larger scheme of things, it seems fair to say that Google doesn&#x27;t have a malicious use of the data in mind.",1388148939

6970416,comment,6970198,6970198,7,0,Udo,,,"The alternating aversion and draw of global state seems cyclical to me, and in many case the distinction is in name only. For example, JavaScript&#x27;s scoping - even in code without &quot;global&quot; variables - is global-like in that the parent context is always inherited by sub-objects. Also, you couldn&#x27;t invoke any of the built-in objects and functions without them being global in some fashion. It&#x27;s in fact one of the reasons why it&#x27;s so much fun to work with function objects. Yet, many JS programmers balk at the notion of globality whenever it&#x27;s expressed explicitly.<p>One of the reasons global state gets a bad rap is because we&#x27;re always trying to minimize side effects, and that&#x27;s a worthy goal. The idea not only makes sure the program&#x27;s components test well individually, it also enables better component re-use (although I&#x27;m still convinced that re-use without refactoring is mostly a myth in practice). However, in striving to ban explicit global state we have developed an astonishing array of cruft and complexity which counteracts the effects we wanted to achieve in the first place.<p>I agree with the article that well-defined and clean global data makes a lot of code easier to handle and it also eliminates unnecessary work, both on the human and the machine side. Of course, this idea breaks down again when the global substrate becomes muddled and structurally broken. At which point we&#x27;ve come full circle.<p>In my opinion a mixed approach is probably advisable for most projects and in fact, that&#x27;s the way we already do things in many cases, even if we&#x27;re forbidden to use the actual phrase &quot;global variables&quot;. Judicious use of both paradigms yields the best results in my opinion. Maybe it&#x27;s time to actually start calling global state by its real name, without expecting to be stigmatized for it.",1388148228

6970391,comment,6966264,6969853,1,0,dschiptsov,,,"OK, I will try to explain. The problem with Java is that it doesn&#x27;t actually fits for mobile development (or any sane development at all) being just a buzzword, a bubble inflated by corporate money.<p>Consider the very basics of system architecture. There is something called ABI, which defines how syscalls are used and implemented. Android uses its own ABI which is a flavor of Linux ABI for ARM architecture (actually it supports different ARM chips and even x86, but it doesn&#x27;t matter).<p>According to these ABIs we perform syscall as it is in a Linux system. So, when we do Math we actually call procedures from libm.so, when we do crypto we call libssl.so (from OpenSSL) etc. It also has its own variant of libc.so and implementation of OpenGL ES, as one could guess, libGL.so.<p>How does Java fits here? Well, according to original concept, it ought to be an isolated VM on top of any OS, which supposed to be run everywhere, and everything must be written (once) in pure Java.<p>Because of that brilliant idea to simply ignore what an OS provides, they have re-implemented everything its own, <i>proper</i> way - famous Strings, Calendar, UTF-32, you name it.<p>So-called reality, however, imposed some necessary corrections, and the kluge called JNI was added. It allows to break the purity and, using ugly and very inefficient mechanisms, dlload and call OS and third-party libraries.<p>What we have in Android is, basically, a bunch of JNI calls to Android Runtime (libart.so, if I got it correctly) which is, not surprisingly, have nothing to do with Java. I am not an expert to tell how the bytecode translator (dx) works, but it doesn&#x27;t really matter.<p>Why do Android has Java at all? The answer is quite simple - because it is such a huge buzzword, such a great scam. It was the way to gain attention of ignorant masses^W^Wmillions of coders. &quot;Wait, Java? Sounds familiar!&quot; (The very same idea to play the Javascript card with WebOS have died, thank god.)<p>So, the developers of complex (read: real-world) apps such as FB have realized that this unnecessary Java layer can&#x27;t be used for anything but hello-words or http-get-post apps, and that it is much easier to avoid Java at all (what&#x27;s the point to have the overhead of all that JNI calls), because, one could see, it is just an unnecessary, artificial layer which doesn&#x27;t fit anywhere (except manager&#x27;s presentations).<p>I probably missed some details, but I am not an Android expert.",1388147401

This may very well induce RSI because &quot;using the arrow keys&quot; is something that we tend to do all the time.<p>I&#x27;m using the key physically at the left of the space bar (I don&#x27;t like talking about the &#x27;name&#x27; of the key because it&#x27;s very keyboard-dependent) as the modifier which allows me to move the cursor. And I move the cursor using modifier+ijkl (for ijkl reproduces the inverted T arrow cluster, not unlike how gamers like to use WASD or ESDF). I do hit the modifier using my left thumb, which is a finger much stronger than the pinky (and, arguably, such a setup is less RSI inducing).<p>Regarding covering the arrow keys and numpad with a mouse platform: many people opt for for a &quot;TKL&quot; (no numpad) or even 60% keyboard (no numpad, no arrow cluster) and typically those 60% keyboards have the benefit of coming with quality switches (also arguably less RSI inducing).<p>If you want to see what others are doing, two great sites are geekhack.org and deskthority.net.<p>FWIW I use a 60% keyboard which has CTRL at the correct place (i.e. where CAPS-LOCK is on keyboards which have a caps-lock): an HHKB Pro 2 (using the amazing Topre switches)... Which doesn&#x27;t even have a CAPS-LOCK key.<p>Note that lately there seem to be a regain in interest in alternate setups and alternate mappings: for example the &quot;SpaceFN&quot; layout uses the space bar as an additional modifier (when it is held down) and ijkl to move the cursor around (once again: ijkl and not vim&#x27;s hjkl and a strong finger, the thumb, to press the modifier).<p>Regarding remapping and &quot;feeling completely lost&quot; on other OSes: if you want to not have to remap your keyboard on Windows / OS X / Linux etc. you may want to buy a keyboard which has a programmable controller: your setup then works the way you want on any computer.",1388146862

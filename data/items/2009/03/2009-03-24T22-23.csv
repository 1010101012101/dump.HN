They're basically the cheapest and best.<p>If it's a personal site or you're on a really strict budget, get RapidSSL. It's a single cert, non chained, cheap enough. A wildcard is $149 a year which will serve most needs well. However, there's one important caveat - mobile phone browsers <i>suck</i> and you will have difficulties with them using a RapidSSL cert. Long and miserable experience there, trust me.<p>If you care about mobile browsers, or your few remaining strands of hair, you need GeoTrust, which bumps the price up. ""TrueBusinessID"" is the one you need, $114 for a single or $499/yr for the wildcard.<p>For both of these, the prices are lower for multiple years, of which you should probably buy as many as you can afford. Refreshing SSL certs is a nasty fiddly process and unless you are on a <i>really</i> low budget it is probably best to eat the upfront cost and buy 5 years out.<p>In answer to your question, why isn't there any other options - well, because they were there first and their cert is everywhere and that's the price they want. Simple as that. Sucks but here we are. At least $499 is less than $995.<p>(I am not affiliated with Servertastic in any way, shape or form other than as a satisfied customer)<p>(edited to correct prices, i'd put the multi year discounts instead of single year prices. sorry!)",1237935368

Its design assumes proficiency with C, however, so, while very practical, it's probably not as good a language for people new to programming.",1237935344

Python (which is great) is the child of many, many Lisp-y ideas, but I don't think people will be using a variant of Python 32 years from now.

It's wonderful to quickly prototype graphics code in Python with full error checking.<p>Also, if you haven't used it yet, check out Py++.  It takes a lot of the pain out of hand-authoring a Boost.Python code file.  I'm using Py++ to automatically generate Boost.Python bindings for the C++ library FCollada.  (FCollada is a library for accessing 3D modeling data exported into the .dae COLLADA format.)<p>Thanks for the tip about Cairo.<p>Also, glVertex3d, 3dv, 3f, etc are part of the standard GL API.  The 'd' suffix indicates 'double', 'f' indicates 'float', 'i' indicates 'int', 's' indicates 'short', and the 'v' suffix indicates that the function accepts a pointer rather than 3 separate components passed by value.  Of course, the glVertex* API has been deprecated because VBOs are far more efficient.<p>Just curious again, why do you use OpenGL for Anybots?  Do you create simulations before building new robot prototypes?",1237935281

Basically, any site that JavaScript or images from from another domain (especially addthis.com, google-analytics.com, gravatar, disqus, intensedebate, adsense, recaptcha, etc.) are breaking, sometimes badly. AFAICT, the only way to keep a site working in IE8 with InPrivate Blocking turned on will be to host <i>everything</i> from the same domain (or a subdomain) as the page.<p>Note that InPrivate Blocking functions independently of InPrivate Browsing; you can keep your local history and cookies functional (InPrivate Browsing Off) while having InPrivate Blocking On. That means it is convenient enough to use all the time (like I am doing) in order to block ads and other annoying widgets. It is also something that is pretty easy to turn on and use accidentally (especially since its effects don't start right away).<p>If you depend on any third-party content on your site, you should definitely make sure your site works in InPrivate Blocking mode before IE8 gets pushed out to millions of people on Windows Update.",1237934890

Basically, we made start.io to act as an attachment to a browser.<p>But some people really do like sharing their links.  Maybe it's just that they're used to sharing all their content online.

The obvious example here is Twitter, which began as a service to publish away messages to the web.  Then people wanted to group their thoughts to channels, then they wanted to message, now they want to network and expand their names and products.

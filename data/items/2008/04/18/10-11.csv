167123,comment,167076,167076,0,0,maryrosecook,,,"I don't get distracted by music at all.<p>If I want to get focused quickly, I listen to some particularly horrible electronica (Winnipeg Is A Frozen Shithole by Venetian Snares is a good example).  If it's three in the morning, I listen to some minimal electronica (Vladislav Delay, B. Fleischmann both good).<p>Otherwise, it's whatever I'm enjoying at the moment (recently: brutal hardcore like Circle Takes The Square, weird indie like Frog Eyes and Sunset Rubdown).<p>Finally, long albums are good because of the longer gaps between ends of songs and ends of records.",1208516024

Its not hard, there are just no helper functions.  So AJAX is AJAX in Django.  He explains that in the article but catchy titles are what people read and remember.  The title should instead be ""Django has no helper functions for AJAX""<p>That I agree with and think should be changed.  Is anyone working on this?",1208514599

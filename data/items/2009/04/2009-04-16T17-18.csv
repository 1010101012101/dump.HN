Who is going to edit video on an iPhone? You might want to cut out a small part of a recording and send that to friend, but I find it hard to call that 'video editting' or label that as an important function.<p>Phones have been able to video call for a while now, but no-one does it, and I guess there's a reason for that.<p>It then continues to say that a) the iPhone needs a more powerful GPU to compete on the gaming market and b) that game houses are interested in the iPhone because of its installed base of 30 million. That doesn't really add up, if you need the more powerful graphics, the previous devices are useless to you, and so you have to start with a base of 0 users. Even worse, because 30 million people already have an iPhone/iPod touch, they are less likely to upgrade to the new version any time soon.<p>It also states that more powerful CPU/GPU is necessary for editing office documents. I don't see how more power is going to help in that aspect. The bottleneck here is a poor interface for editing documents. The limited screen size and poor input method are something you can't fix with more power.<p>That said, I do think that a more powerful iPhone is attractive. It works now, but it would be much nicer if Safari would be more responsive and could hold pages in its cache for longer. Right now looking up something on Google might take more than a minute, with slow Safari start times and slow 3G connectivity.<p>A faster iPhone will become more usable immediately, even without new apps taking advantage of the increased speed.",1239902527

He's well published[2] and has chaired at least one conference on unconventional computing[3]. So that's more than I can say about my career in theoretical computer science. I suspect having unconventional thoughts alone will create some dissonance in related communities. Similar to what Doron Zeilberger gets for his beliefs in Ultrafinitism.<p>I agree that Akl is talking about a very specific circumstance of UTMs. How many thousands of Mathematicians and Computer Scientists have read that paper in the last 60 years and verified it? If there were ever going to be any true challenge to UTMs it had to be obscure and weird like this. That doesn't mean that I believe he's right, but I don't think he's a crackpot just unconventional.<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unconventional_computing"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unconventional_computing</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://research.cs.queensu.ca/Parallel//publications.html#Publications"" rel=""nofollow"">http://research.cs.queensu.ca/Parallel//publications.html#Pu...</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selim_Akl#Conferences"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selim_Akl#Conferences</a>",1239902064

Lambda functions don't do anything, they're just notations. The process of beta reduction is what causes things/computation to happen.

And the Internet keeps getting cheaper. The old argument seen here -- that the Internet will just be a plaything for the rich -- gets less relevant every day.<p>Back in 1995 only geeks knew that the Internet was an amazing social tool.

Gym class <i>is</i> hard to deliver via TCP/IP (alas for our waistlines) as is driver's ed -- but friends, clubs, teams, and art class turn out to be lots of fun online.

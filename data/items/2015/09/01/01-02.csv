The child was exceptionally sleepy, groggy, slipping in and out of awareness. The adult walked back over to the other adults, and the pizza, while holding the child.<p>If you&#x27;ve ever seen how out of it a very tired child can be, you understand that&#x27;s more than enough to explain the sense of out of body + seeing above the table. We&#x27;re talking about a four year old after all, their comprehension of the awake/asleep line in that circumstance would be extremely low.

Private institutions, especially colleges and universities, are exactly where they want to be right now. Parents have an extremely inelastic demand for sending their children to good private schools because signaling is so important in this terrible job market - this allows universities to raise tuition with impunity.

It&#x27;s just  sight-like, in that the same general information about shape, color, arrangement, etc. can be pulled up, with effort. Closing the eyes isn&#x27;t strictly necessary, but helps avoid the distraction of actual sight.<p>It&#x27;s very sensitive to attention/intention: asked to visualize a person, I&#x27;ll mostly imagine the face and general build – not even picking specific clothes – unless that person is very associated with some outfit. But if I think more about some specific prompt – say, &quot;what were they wearing at some recent event&quot;, or &quot;think about their hairline&quot; – I can call up (or pick) reasonable details.<p>I suppose you could say it&#x27;s no more vivid than it needs to be, and with concentration it becomes more vivid/detailed, but never quite like the solidity of a photograph.

10150260,comment,10148792,10150081,0,0,versteegen,,,"Yes. I find that when I imagine a scene there might be a lot of details missing without extra effort to imagine them. If I imagine a beach I might immediately get a detailed convincing image just like watching a video clip, with waves, birds, etc, because beach scenes come to mind very easily. But if I have to visualise some vague memory or novel scene I do get a very vague impression that isn&#x27;t really an image at all. If I ask myself: &quot;what&#x27;s the carpet?&quot;, &quot;what&#x27;s on the walls?&quot;, etc, I can slowly add details until I get a proper image by piecing together memories.<p>On the other hand I am very bad at recognising people or visualising faces! Even if I try to visualise my own face or the faces of my parents or a celebrity like Bill Clinton I get something that&#x27;s very uncanny, distorted and missing details. The part of your brain for recognising faces is signicant in size and very specialised, so it makes good sense that you might be able to visualise faces but not other scenes or vice versa.<p>BTW, I am a VERY visual thinker, I even do algebra in my head by imagining equations floating in space in front of me and moving terms around &quot;physically&quot;. But I&#x27;m not an extrovert. If I can&#x27;t visualise something (e.g. much of abstract algebra) I&#x27;m hopeless at it.",1441072373

If you are new to this and the price feels a little uncomfortable you are probably getting closer to its real value.<p>2. Discounting screams you don&#x27;t know the value of your product/service.  Try not to &quot;discount&quot; your product/service, instead A/B testing is smarter to set some parameters.  Also, I&#x27;d second what taprun says on discounts too in his comment.<p>3.  Set your pricing not based on what the service costs you to operate, develop, maintain etc.  Set your pricing based on the value you provide to the client.<p>4. Don&#x27;t immediately reach change the price when you are starting out.  Evaluate everything equally to price, it may be who you are marketing to, product/market fit etc.  And much of that is far more impactful than just price alone.<p>5. Try to keep you pricing scheme simple.  The easier it is to understand the better.  Ideally I like to see at most 3-4 &quot;levels&quot; of pricing, more than that and users start getting confused what to select and are more likely to bail and not try any of them.<p>6. Experiment with free trials to see if it may help your conversion rate.  I can&#x27;t say it is ideal in all situations nor does it work in all, but it is worth evaluating.",1441071500

Like many paradoxes of the kind, it illustrates the ambiguity of the question and, by extension, the lack of nuance in the way we describe and reason about probabilities (in general, that is; of course one who has learned some probability theory is likely to be able to understand and communicate the difference).<p>Implicit in any answer is a way of valuing the choices made.  In the 1/3 case, it is assumed that being right twice is better than being right once - for example, you get $100 each time you answer correctly.  In the 1/2 case, it&#x27;s assumed that answering the same question correctly twice isn&#x27;t inherently better than answering it correctly once - for example, you have to debate an opponent at each awakening.  You&#x27;re either right or wrong and you don&#x27;t get extra credit for winning the same debate with the same opponent twice.",1441069392

And if it varies across individuals, why is it <i>impossible</i> to vary with one individual over time, or change drastically in a short period of time?  Can the physiology of your body change to (for example) start extracting more calories from food than it normally does?  It doesn&#x27;t seem like that crazy of an idea to me, and if it can do this (as anecdotal evidence suggests), then it makes weight loss strategies much more complicated, and it makes the simple calculations no longer work under all scenarios.<p>This doesn&#x27;t seem like a terribly controversial idea to me.",1441069223

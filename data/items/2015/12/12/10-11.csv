Let&#x27;s say there&#x27;s going to be some kind of &quot;first mover advantage&quot; where the first nation to build an AI that&#x27;s sufficiently smart has the possibility to neuter the attempts being made by other nations.  If there&#x27;s a first mover advantage, we don&#x27;t want a close arms race, because then each team will be incentivized to cut corners in order to be the first mover.  Let&#x27;s say international tensions happen to be high around this time and nations race to put anything in to production in order to be the first.<p>The issue with something like OpenAI is that increasing the common stock of public AI knowledge leaves arms race participants closer to one another, which means a more heated race.<p>And if there&#x27;s no first mover advantage, that&#x27;s basically the scenario where AI was never going to be an issue to begin with.

Not bz2, but bzip, the original one, mostly seen as &quot;version 0.21&quot;?<p>Well, at the time it was released, people were making much the same arguments (with kittens). It compressed so much better than gzip, no reason to use the obsolete gzip format and tools, etc. And some of us jumped on the hype bandwagon and started recompressing our data, only to find out afterwards that bzip2 is now the new thing and the format is not only obsolete, but also patent-encumbered and in general needs to be phased out.<p>From a long-term perspective I&#x27;m fine with gzip. At least I know that I&#x27;ll be able to open my data in 10 years time, which is not the case with bzip-0.21. The jury is still out on &quot;xz&quot;, in my opinion.",1449915678

What I was trying to convey is to give the reader a chance to reevaluate the decision to send parameters that way, rather than trying to accept it as it is. It is hard for experienced people to think that way because they have become accustomed, but most of the time, in programming, we don&#x27;t realize simpler solutions are possible.

If the person is classified under &quot;Software Developers, Applications&quot;, they must be paid at least $98,342 in the San Jose area. My title at my company is &quot;Software Engineer&quot; and they classified me under &quot;Software Developers, Applications&quot; while applying for a visa for me.<p>Unfortunately, the O*NET job title classification system also has other redundant ones like &quot;Computer Programmers&quot; and &quot;Web Developers&quot;. The prevailing wages for those are far lower. For example, in the San Jose area, the minimum wage for H1B &quot;Computer Programmers&quot; is ~$51k, and for &quot;Web Developers&quot; it&#x27;s ~$66k.

As a perfect example, I wouldn&#x27;t recommend putting the decision of launching a nuclear weapon in the hands of some AI system.  Though the AI wouldn&#x27;t be evil in its intention to launch nuclear bombs inadvertently, the inadequacies of its ability to understand when it would be appropriate to launch nuclear bombs would certainly cause a lot of problems the world would need to deal with in the aftermath (if anyone were to survive).",1449915010

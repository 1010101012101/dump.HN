1238384,comment,1238131,1238293,0,0,brettnak,,,"I, too, believe that most technology internships are a total scam.  The usual phrase from a small company is that they want a 'rock star' ( insert your synonym here ) intern.  I'm fairly certain that any 'rock star' intern can replace many hours of labor spent by an FTE.<p>To put it in some perspective, and this is all personal point of view, I believe that a company in three to four months of a full time internship should be able to teach a computer science student ruby, rails to a working knowledge extent, the why's and how's of why rails is the way it is (the ups and downs of MVC, convention over configuration, etc), limited database knowledge, and some basic UI/UX considerations.<p>Deeper knowledge into any of those (especially databases with CAP and the whole sql/nosql argument) would be valuable if there were any time remaining.  And, obviously, the previous paragraph can be replaced by the equivalents in your specific niche.<p>EDIT: spelling",1270280972

1238379,comment,1238195,1238195,0,0,rbranson,,,"I think he undersells the iPad by comparing it to a cameraphone.<p>Due to the fact that good lenses and flash require a certain amount of space, and no amount of technology is going to change that any time soon, cameraphones will NEVER be as good at ANY kind of pictures as even the cheapest point-and-shoots. These are phones FIRST. The camera is just another bullet point in the feature list.<p>A multi-touch tablet with an OS and a bunch of applications designed from the ground up exclusively for a touch-based interface isn't a second class citizen here. The primary purpose of the iPad is for using applications. It is, in some ways, better than a laptop for certain tasks. It comes back from sleep quicker, is more portable, sips the battery slower, and touch interfaces work better for many applications.<p>In fact, when I think all of this is over, it might be a boon for desktops. While it's cute to hack code in the kitchen or at Starbucks, let's face it, you aren't getting as much work done when you're stuck on that tiny screen, using that cramped keyboard, fiddling around with that touchpad. Laptops will continue to be very important, but it might end up being cheaper and work out better for many people just to buy something like a mac mini and a tablet device.<p>In the end, can't we all just agree that we have different needs and that each of us is entitled to have the devices that we choose and afford?",1270280757

I'm gonna make my own Facbeook"". The brothers then claim the code was really meant for them and later win millions just for knowing Zuckerberg.<p>Now, you claim that because Mark talked about Facebook with you and (gasp) went to your website to look at it, that you somehow deserve credit for Facebook even though, as you admit, your own website didn't have any traction.

People seem completely unable to imagine the other side of the table in situations they haven't been in. I did an unpaid internship for the state government at one point for a couple months and learned quite a bit how government works, made some friends, and got to meet some interesting people.<p>Later, I had an unpaid intern come in and work for 3 hours twice a week with me. It evolved into me sitting, working hands on and training him for 2 and a half hours of that time, teaching him all sorts of things, and he'd make some reports during the week about that and some writeups, which I used as the basis of some marketing literature.<p>But if I'm going to be totally honest - it was a fun experience, a good time, he's a great guy, but it was a bad business decision. I'd have produced a lot more in the 6-10 hours per week on my own or working with one of my paid staff or contractors than I did with him. He got a heck of a lot of it. Me? I mean, it was good fun, I learned some things, I don't regret it at all, but in the end the time cost on my side was more than it was worth.<p>An unpaid internship can absolutely be worth a heck of a lot  - I mean, many of us wind up paying thousands for some college courses of dubious value. Getting to spend hands-on time with someone talented, seeing how they do things - that can be a tremendous amount of value if you're in the right organization working with the right person or people.<p>Personally, I probably won't take an unpaid intern again, but there's a lot of people I'd work for free for in some capacity to learn from.",1270278377

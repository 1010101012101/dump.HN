2671340,comment,2670876,2670876,3,0,hugh3,,,"History is a relatively easy subject to teach and learn, <i>once</i> everybody agrees on what bits are important and should be taught. A hundred years ago we had this all figured out --we might have had an excessively narrow perspective on history, but at least we all agreed about it.<p>With the ongoing ""death of God"", as Nietzsche would put it, all the old certainties have been swept away without anything sensible to replace them. So the history syllabus has become a political battleground for partisans of all sorts of folks to play with. If students are forced to spend weeks at a time studying the dude who invented peanut butter or some dispute over bus seating, is it any wonder that the big picture gets lost?<p>As a first step, I would split history into two sections: ""overall chronology"" and ""detailed studies"". In ""overall chronology"" we'd study the basic flow of human history over the last five or seven thousand years, trying not to overly stress any particular event or group of people. Picture a giant wall chart with time along the <i>x</i> axis and all the major human civilizations plotted up and down the <i>y</i>, and then we sit down and learn the dates of key events. Start of the Han dynasty. Fall of Constantinople. Founding of Buenos Aires. Not worrying too much about what they <i>mean</i>, though.<p>In the second, we could pay attention to the details. Individual people, events, what it was like to live at a given time. We could never cover the entire chart at a detailed level, but at least we'd know the details were still there.",1308506392

2671338,comment,2670772,2670849,1,0,Tichy,,,"How did BitCoin pivot, though? Seems to me it has been BitCoin from the start, and seems unlikely to change.<p>Also how is it a scam, if the technology is open? It is exactly clear what BitCoin is and does. Everybody can take the specs and program their own client. Nobody can claim ""BitCoin cures cancer"" or something that.<p>Now if the current exchange rate is justified is another question. Also obviously people holding BitCoins are interested in making it more popular, as that is also related to the exchange rate.<p>I don't think that automatically makes it a scam, though. It is not so different from people invested in Google or Apple (either via stock or via technology usage) are interested in making Google and Apple more popular, as it increases the value of their investment.<p>Then again, perhaps the whole world is just a scam.",1308506354

Historians are never required to write for people other than historians.""<p>In my opinion, this is probably the biggest problem.  History was almost always presented to me as a desiccated list of facts, dates, and sanitized ""causes of events"" that needed to be memorized so you could pass the test and move on.  Few teachers seemed to be able to put any life into the subject, or present the subject as a large single picture instead of tiny disjoint sets of data.<p>I don't know what approach would have worked best to get a younger me more interested in history.  Maybe something in the style of ""The Island at the Center of the World"" would have worked--I do find that readable and interesting now.",1308505968

In that case what's standing between me and signing up is ignorance, and you're leaving that barrier in place.  There's nobody out there so similar to me that it's worth my while to sign up for any web site they use, but there are a lot of people out there with enough taste and intelligence that if they use your service AND I'm interested in the same kind of service, then I'll sign up.",1308505582

Issues such as whether your machine will stop completely at some inconvenient moment to perform a GC when you least expect or desire it.  Issues such as whether your language is in fact caching stuff in hash tables, and so what appears in your code to be linear, isn't.<p>And so on.<p>More and more it seems necessary to resort to experiment and tests to see what happens, rather than being able to determine things for sure and definite via analysis.<p>Exciting times, but slightly disappointing.",1308505086

On any given day, if Google and its algorithms deem you unworthy, your livelihood, income, traffic, etc, could be washed out to sea and there isn't much you can do about it.  We've all allowed Google to have this power.  Oops.<p>I sell on android.  Very soon the new market client is supposed to come out, based on what they said at Google I/O.  On that day, I may never sell another app, but I have no idea what will happen, maybe I'll sell a million, but at least I'm aware that I'm at their mercy.",1308502951

2671202,comment,2670632,2671137,4,0,mjb,,,"Of course it's worth implementing better data structures in Python. There are two ways to make a Python program faster: make the Python program faster, or implement computationally intensive parts in another language (including using a library written in another language). Which of these approaches is 'best' depends heavily on what your goals are. There are many advantages to keeping code in pure Python rather than moving to C - not least issues like portability and maintainability.<p>There are also some Python operations that have a large constant time - operations which are much slower, but still O(1), in Python than they are in lower level languages. In these cases, choosing algorithms which reduce the number of operations of that type can be a bigger win than a simple big-O analysis would suggest and allow pure Python code to compete better with code written in lower-level languages.<p>Better algorithms are the right answer the fast programs more often than faster code. There is room for both, but the ""if the code isn't fast you may as well not bother with a good algorithm"" claim is generally false.",1308502920

I'm going to start high and see how it goes. I can always lower the price later. This has been the most commonly echoed piece of advice that I have received since the posting (both in thread and out.)<p>- Re: the documents.  All of the documents are of public record. (SSN, full account numbers, etc. are all censored by both the debtor's attorney and by the creditor's attorneys.)<p>- re: Calendar consolidation.  One client is currently testing a desktop app that downloads all of his PDFs and organizes them on his local share and also syncs his calendar entries with Exchange.   I plan on allowing syncing with Exchange, Outlook, Google Calendar, and iCal after I see how this test goes.<p>I appreciate your comments. I'd love to hear more about your marketing software idea as well.",1308502890

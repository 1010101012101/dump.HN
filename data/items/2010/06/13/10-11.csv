Here are the specs: \n<a href=""http://www.satimagingcorp.com/satellite-sensors/ikonos.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.satimagingcorp.com/satellite-sensors/ikonos.html</a><p>It has a panchromatic sensor (greyscale) and red, green and blue sensors. Ikonos has a ground speed of 6.8 km per second, so even if the sensors are only a few centimeters apart, the images would need to be recombined at an offset. The offset would be tuned for static ground objects.<p>So I guess the ghosting is due to both the altitude and the speed of the airplane relative to the ground.",1276426779

As a college student who will soon be attempting to get a job (presumably as some sort of software developer, since I'm a CS major), I don't think saying ""you'll find a job if you're good"" really tells me much.  I don't KNOW if I'm good.  I'm confident in my comprehension of Computer Science topics, my ability to learn and find out things I don't know, and my ability to present myself well in an interview.  Will that be enough for an entry level job?",1276426125

1427277,comment,1427172,1427172,0,0,fezzl,,,"First of all, it's nice to see Malaysians other than myself dabbling in entrepreneurship. As a Malaysian, I know what it's like trying to run a start-up locally; the environment is just too non-conducive, for various reasons I'm sure you're familiar with.<p>My advice is to try to dissociate yourself from all the noise out there (all the get-rich-quick seminars, how-to-make-millions-on-the-internet books, work-from-home business ""opportunities"", etc.) and immerse yourself in the real gems of knowledge (e.g. blogs by entrepreneurs, Hacker News, TechCrunch, etc.) to get the right paradigm.<p>Second advice, get new friends. Go to local start-up gatherings and know people. Best of all, get incubated in a local incubator. Unfortunately, if you depend heavily on social validation and you're not self-contained socio-emotionally (i.e. you feel the need to ""hang out"" and ""talk"" to someone all the time just to be functional), which you sound like you are, I think this might be a painful change to make. If you've identified your current friends as a negative influence on your ambitions and personal objectives, you know it's time to discard them.<p>The truth is that your current friends are probably a dime a dozen. If you want fight the negative influence, the only option is to dissociate yourself from them, not to try to ""manage"" it or, worse, to try to change them. Start spending more time with your family instead to fulfill your socio-emotional needs.",1276425916

1427273,comment,1427137,1427137,0,0,ugh,,,"I get the feeling that South Koreans are a lot less keen to be unified than West Germans were before the cold war ended, probably justifiably so.<p>There was at least some exchange between West and East, nothing like the complete isolation of North Korea. East Germans could just turn on their TV and watch some West German television when they wanted to compare systems. (Areas the West German TV signals couldn’t reach were called “Valleys of the Clueless” :) East Germany was also one of the most “progressive” eastern bloc states, supposed to be a showcase for actually existing socialism. And, as far as tyrannies go, one of the milder ones, while Kim Jong-il is all the way up there with Hitler and Stalin.<p>Then there is time: East Germany survived for forty years, North Korea is in its seventh decade. It survived the last twenty years without a cold war keeping it alive (except the one between North and South Korea, I guess).<p>The German unification cost billions and caused many problems. By no means an easy process that’s now, twenty years after it started, by no means completely finished. So I kind of can understand South Koreans who are weary of the prospect of unification. Unification did work out ok. I don’t know whether that would have been the case had East Germany been a lot more like North Korea.",1276425643

I haven't seen any data indicating that Facebook has increased the number of victims of violence.<p>I know it's not popular to think this way but statistically you're far more likely to be victimized by someone you know rather than random person from the internets.

I'd also suggest that teenagers role models in the 20-30 year old age range all act like children (IMHO, see any TV show aimed at teens) and offer little or no inspiration to 'grow up'.<p>The older generation expect little of the younger generation and they live up to that.

Now observe that your topic is 100% bullshit.</i><p>I would like a shot at it. I have been discussing this with a lot of people. The question is:<p><i>""What exactly is reality?""</i><p>Now this may seem bullshit at first. ""Come on reality is what we can see and prove"", ""reality is what is 'true'"", ""I know it is real when I see it"". These are some of the very diverse answers that I get to such a question.<p>My personal take is, that we define something as real when a mass majority starts to believe in it. Everyone has his/her different take on if something is real or not. But for ages every body ""knows"" that something is real when an authority gauges what the masses believe and declares it ""real"". For example 1500 years back every body ""knew"" earth is the centre of the universe, why? Because the church said so. They also knew that earth was flat. why? Because the earth said so. We also ""knew"" that the electron is a particle, why? because some scientists said so or some of the experiments (which were then proven wrong) said so.<p>So tell me, why is it that something is real once and not after some time. So isn't reality a subjective thing? Now this may sound <i>BullShit</i> to you but makes sense to me.",1276424845

My dad grew up in a 3rd world country.  His family would be considered upper-class within their city, and yet they had 10 children crammed into a couple rooms, geckos in their living spaces, and mosquito nets to keep away the malaria.  And they got bombed out of their home by the Americans, and had to move up into the mountains, shit in the river, and use stones to wipe their ass.<p>I included waterbill and trashbill in my utilities estimates; I was basing it off what I paid for utilities when I lived with roommates in California.<p>Person 1, at least, didn't have a landline - he used his cell (still on his parents plan) or IM from work.  Person 1 also did not have zero savings: he managed to save up $20K over 2 years.  Remember, a typical grad student salary is about $20k/year, and he was living off $10K/year.<p>People who make $10-20k/year don't pay much in taxes.  Many don't pay anything.  That's reverse-income-tax land.<p>You have a point with clothes, but over the short term, it can be ignored.  I'm still wearing some of my clothes from high school, 10 years later.  And you certainly have a point about health care, which is the elephant in the room, though that will hopefully get better as Obama's plan phases in.<p>I suspect that Daniel Kanemann's research could be rephrased as ""For a good life, you have to be making more than average.""  It's not coincidence that $60K/year is just slightly more than median household income in the U.S.  I suspect that if he were to run the same experiment in Vanuatu - supposedly the happiest place on earth - he'd find that you need roughly $5K/year for the good life.

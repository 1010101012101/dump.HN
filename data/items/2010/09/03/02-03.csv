I toured and worked from every coworking space I could find in Portland before settling at the one I presently work out of. I'm happy with it, but not thrilled; I've talked to other Portlanders about doing something better.<p>Point being: do your research. Many coworking spaces do ""day passes"", or if you know someone who works from or runs a space, ask if you can work there for a day for free. Everyone has different sensitivities to noise levels, the ergonomics of the work furniture provided, and so forth. Not every space is going to work for everyone.<p>It is a big cost saver, though. Even in a cheap city like Portland, getting decent office space and everything that has to go with it would be a helluva lot more than I pay to work from a coworking space.",1283482598

I had no money but I couldn't imagine another year in the office. When I walked in to quit my job my boss wasn't expecting it (tad different from your scenario) so started to drill down why I was leaving-- for me it amounted to not being able to have freedom of movement and work when I want etc. The office was killing me. We ended up hammering out a remote working arrangement that has served me well and allowed me to get a bunch of other projects off the ground. I wouldn't have predicted this opportunity to come up, so I guess I benefited from a classic case of ""you need to close one door to open others...""

1658472,comment,1655851,1656579,0,0,Jtsummers,,,"So hga has the gist of the history, but here's a bit about the use of dynamic vs lexical scoping.<p>Dynamic scoping allows you to do things like:<p><pre><code>  (setq x 10)\n  (defun foo (y) (+ x y))\n  (foo 3) ;; => 13\n  (let ((x -10))\n    (foo 3)) ;; dynamic => -7, lexical => 13\n</code></pre>\nlexical scoping requires you to either explicitly pass this as a parameter:<p><pre><code>  (defun foo (y &optional (x 10)) (+ x y))\n  (foo 3) ;; => 13\n  (foo 3 -10) ;; => -7\n</code></pre>\nor modify some value that is in the same scope as <i>foo</i> (lets assume they're both in the global scope for instance):<p><pre><code>  (setq x 10)\n  (defun foo (y) (+ x y))\n  (let ((old-x x))\n    (setf x -10)\n    (print (foo 3)) ;; -7\n    (setf x old-x))\n</code></pre>\nThe second one allows us to not change the definition of <i>foo</i>, and the former requires us to be aware that we need to pass this parameter through every function call until <i>foo</i> is reached.<p>On the other hand lexical scoping offers the possibility of closures which dynamic scope does not:<p><pre><code>  (defun bar (x) (lambda (y) (+ x y)))\n</code></pre>\nIn a lexically scoped language we can then do:<p><pre><code>  (funcall (bar 3) 10) ;; => 13\n</code></pre>\nIn a dynamically scoped language if <i>x</i> is not defined the above results in an error, and if it is defined we get something like:<p><pre><code>  (let ((x -10))\n    (funcall (bar 3) 10)) ;; => -7\n</code></pre>\nThose are, of course, just two (simple) examples. All the above example code should work (unless I copied it wrong, next time I'm writing a comment like this in emacs with slime running) in emacs lisp and Common Lisp if you have either or both available to play with. In emacs lisp they demonstrate dynamic scope, and by using <i>setq</i> in CL it will demonstrate lexical scope. If you want to see dynamic scope in CL try running it with <i>defvar</i> instead.<p>Another example, this is to demonstrate that dynamic scope is also influenced by parameter names:<p><pre><code>  (setq x 10)\n  (defun foo (y) (+ x y))\n  (defun bar (x) (foo x))\n  (bar 3) ;; dynamic => 6, lexical => 13\n</code></pre>\nThis demonstrates a (potentially) major issue with dynamic scoping (at least as implemented by emacs lisp), that any free variables in functions can be altered by name collisions in any <i>let</i> or parameter list which may occur before it is reached.<p>Edit:<p>Found a couple discussions which add more than what I covered and better demonstrate the utility of dynamic scoping:<p><a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2979428/uses-for-dynamic-scope"" rel=""nofollow"">http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2979428/uses-for-dynamic-...</a><p><a href=""http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/DynamicBindingVsLexicalBinding"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/DynamicBindingVsLexicalBindin...</a>",1283482347

Throughout the campus every poster, every label on every drawer, was beautifully hand calligraphed. Because I had dropped out and didn't have to take the normal classes, I decided to take a calligraphy class to learn how to do this. I learned about serif and san serif typefaces, about varying the amount of space between different letter combinations, about what makes great typography great. It was beautiful, historical, artistically subtle in a way that science can't capture, and I found it fascinating.<p>None of this had even a hope of any practical application in my life. But ten years later, when we were designing the first Macintosh computer, it all came back to me. And we designed it all into the Mac. It was the first computer with beautiful typography. If I had never dropped in on that single course in college, the Mac would have never had multiple typefaces or proportionally spaced fonts. And since Windows just copied the Mac, its likely that no personal computer would have them. If I had never dropped out, I would have never dropped in on this calligraphy class, and personal computers might not have the wonderful typography that they do. Of course it was impossible to connect the dots looking forward when I was in college. But it was very, very clear looking backwards ten years later.""",1283482334

The author's argument is that something can't come out of nothing. You can't use the laws of nature (like Hawking does) to explain where the universe came from because those are something.  Therefor, the universe must have been created by God.<p>Except that the next obvious question is ""Well then, where did God come from?  God is something, isn't he (she/it), and you just said that something can't come from nothing.""  Ah, but when you define God, you define God as something that didn't have to be created.

I have not worked with Trello but will definitely be checking it out.  These tools are all great but believe it or not, when I need to do something really quickly a Google doc spreadsheet does the job.  We're a small team and need to be focused on getting great product out.  Tools that require a lot of work are time sinks and without proper care and feeding they start to bloat with items that are dragged along week-to-week.  Anyone get ""reminder"" emails with tasks that are open but are no longer relevant or just not closed out?",1345039187

4385947,comment,4384815,4384815,1,0,larrywright,,,"With my team I use two products: Pivotal Tracker and Trello.<p>Pivotal is great for development projects. It talks to Github and Campfire, allows us to visually plan things, and has a great worfklow built in for moving stories through the development process. That said, it's not really well suited for either a) non-development projects such as system upgrades, server builds, research projects, etc or b) a steady stream of one-off fixes and tasks that don't tie back to a larger development effort. Small enhancements, bug fixes, infrastructure work, and the like. I originally tried to squeeze all this into Pivotal but it's sort of a square peg/round hole scenario.<p>Trello, on the other hand, is great for all the other ""stuff"" my team has to do. I can have one board that shows me at a glance what everyone is working on (we put placeholder cards in Trello for projects that are being managed in Pivota - there's usually only one or two at any given time). It's very flexible and adapts well for various types of work. In a pinch, I could replace Pivotal with Trello, but I would lose out on all of the integrations with Github and Campfire, as well as the more structured story card format and the agile workflow. Combining the two gives us the best of both worlds.",1345039165

I think they were spoiled by Microsoft's dedication to backwards compatibility at all costs[1], and thought that surely it would hurt Apple more than Adobe to let PS languish. I think they were so sure of this, in fact, that they made few arrangements for the contingency that Apple might just call their bluff. So when that happened, they had an uphill battle to fight.<p>[1] This story comes to mind: <a href=""http://ceklog.kindel.com/2012/04/18/dont-build-apis/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ceklog.kindel.com/2012/04/18/dont-build-apis/</a>",1345039068

4385804,comment,4385609,4385710,28,0,w0utert,,,"Adobe seems to be pretty much clueless when it comes to Flash if you ask me. They never bothered to make a solid version of the plugin for Linux and OS X until the whole Flash-on-iOS debate started and Flash really didn't need more bad press. Then they tried get Flash on the millions of different hardware configurations on mobile, even though none of the existing Flash content was made for touch, none of the handsets had enough power to run most Flash content well, and all despite all the trouble they had supporting just the 3 major desktop OS-es. All of this effort even though Adobe doesn't make any money on Flash player at all, only on the authoring tools, which everyone could see is a dwindling market now that you can do so much on the web without any plugins.<p>I think their current strategy on the desktop is not so much 'content-protected video' (Flash did that 15 years ago already), but high-end gaming. They have some seriously impressive 3D stuff in the pipeline, which coupled with Air would finally make some good use of Flash as a platform-independent way to create games. But my guess is that it's all too little, too late, and that the market for cross-platform advanced 3D graphics development is pretty small. The really big guys that would make good use of it already have their native engines ported to those OS'es that matter, and the small developers probably don't have the budget to create games that really benefit from the technology.<p>It's weird to see how Adobe seems to screw up so often, because they really make some very good products. The whole 64-bit Adobe CS for OS X debacle comes to mind, it took them about 5 years too long to transition from Carbon to Cocoa, even though it was clear from the very first OS X version that Carbon was going to be replaced and would never have a 64-bit version.",1345036837

However, after spending a year working in the industry, I've learned that it's more ""catchy idea"" than reality.<p>It turns out that the taxi industry is a little different: the fleets have wanted to innovate for years now, but have little idea how. The regulations clearly permit innovation. In cities where taxis aren't run by the municipal government (i.e. ""in cities that aren't New York""), there is healthy competition between taxi providers, in spite of their commoditization (regulated pricing, supply, etc.).<p>IMO, the existing taxi technology players are the ones who are stifling innovation (and/or ""protecting a group of entrenched companies at the expense of consumers""). 2 of the big 3 dispatch technology providers charge <i>hefty</i> fees just to open access to their APIs for new entrants, if they'll even grant you access in the first place. And, due to the long-term, hardware-heavy, dispatch-focused nature of their contracts, they rarely have any incentive to innovate for the passengers; one of them once told me that they have <i>nobody</i> on staff who understands the web or web technologies!<p>Working with the existing dispatch companies, while not a necessary evil (take Hailo or GetTaxi, for example), is the best way to ensure scale and distribution -- the amount of cash consumer-focused players must spend in this industry in the hopes of curbing cab booking behaviours is enormous. Our research showed that, when calling for a pre-arranged cab, 95% of taxi passengers chose their fleet because it was first to mind, or the fleet they always called. In other words: only 5% of consumers chose what TaxiCo to call for any rational reason. Having an existing brand identity, and a number of cars on the street constantly hocking your wares, goes a <i>long</i> way in this industry.<p>But even before Uber came along, a wave of new dispatch companies had started cropping up, most of which are relying on a healthy partner ecosystem in order to make it in the first place. But, since dispatch technology contracts have typically been signed as 10-year license agreements, evolution naturally trends to a slow change: a lot of forward-thinking fleets I've met with renewed their contracts in the last year or two, since they didn't feel the new technology was mature enough yet (and, in most cases/for their needs, rightly so).<p>All this to say: I'm not yet sure what the best way to spark the necessary change is (FWIW: currently leaning towards ""open standards"", but I'm not 100% sure how that would look yet...
); figuring it out will likely be a huge benefit to my company. But I firmly believe, based on facts and experience, that it's not a regulatory issue.<p><i>(edit: formatting)</i>",1345036625

(Which btw, Arch does too - although perhaps not the same people.)<p>The advantages the Linux kernel provide (particularly, cgroups) is such a useful thing it would be stupid not to use it just because it doesn't exist everywhere. So either stick with your current init system, make a similar init system that is compatible with unit files (which are extremely simple), or add the necessary features to the BSD kernel. I'm not seeing a valid complaint here because systemd doesn't affect you unless you want it to.<p>>Arch was built with a different mentality - the one of personal freedom to do what the hell you want with your desktop, not for the benefit of some company. You are free to use or reject any software you don't want.<p>> Well, not any more. Pushing systemd on users breaks that mentality - because the choice is stripped from you. The choice is already there in Arch though - and has been for a while. If you want systemd, you can use it. If you don't want it, don't bother. Moving the other way is not really possible though - because if you build your system around systemd, you can't revert back (without taking the time to rewrite everything that depends on systemd.)<p>There is no ""everything that depends on systemd"" other than the init process itself. You say this choice is stripped from you, but what you want is to force the Arch developers to maintain init scripts. Take responsibility for it yourself - get together with other people who want those init scripts maintained and maintain them. You won't get things you want by just demanding that the world give it to you.<p>> The dependency problem in itself is a complaint against systemd. Should udev users be forced to use systemd for example? Normally we would introduce another layer of abstraction to our code - such that we can share common code between systemd-udev and non-systemd-udev, and have a solution where everyone wins - the systemd users benefit from improvements in systemd integration, whilst everyone benefits from improvements to udev which aren't systemd dependent. This is programming 101.<p>Where are these systemd-dependent parts of udev? They don't exist. There is no need for an abstraction layer to deal with the differences because there are no differences from a user perspective.<p>>What I am against though, is the politics of it. The constant pushing of systemd down everyone's throat like it's a fucking panacea.<p>Really, you're more political than anyone I've seen on the pro-systemd side of things.<p>>One day saying ""don't use if if you don't want,"" and the next blogging ""you're fucking idiots for not using it.""

Our economy would be in tatters without that spending (or maybe we're in tatters now but would be naked otherwise).<p>I'd love to see more of our budget employ people doing useful things (directly employ I mean) ... and space science seems like a good long-term investment.  So I'll cheer for India's success and lament its problems along with you, but I haven't a right to dictate its policy.",1345036062

4385748,comment,4378641,4378641,1,0,eslachance,,,"My first reaction to this was ""No... Really???"" with an obvious ironic tone.<p>The fact of the matter is, we are a product of our environment and we naturally try to pick up our traits, values, expressions and emotions from everything and everyone around us. But since books pull you in so much, it's easier to become influenced by them than, say, a short movie. I didn't need OSU to tell me this.<p>However, one critical point here is that the effect is often temporary. I've also noticed that often, where I will have a sudden boost of inspiration and energy after reading a particularly uplifting book, but this only lasts for days or weeks, depending on the book.<p>And that, my friends, explains why self-help books sell so much.",1345036011

Anyone creating a sexual image of a subject who is 17 or younger is guilty of creating child pornography, no matter what the circumstances are.  I'm sure that if Congress had considered the case of 17-year-olds taking pictures of themselves they would have written the law differently, but they didn't.

They're not very popular, because of the inconvenience of charging - a suitable deployment circuit is inherently very power-hungry. The technology is also <i>extremely</i> expensive, adding between $1000 and $1500 to the cost of an already costly protective garment.<p>A cheaper mechanical system uses a pull-cord like the safety cut-off on a treadmill or jetski, but that's still a $500 add-on and may not be feasible on a bicycle due to the lower mass of the vehicle. This doesn't need charging, but the rider has to remember to connect and disconnect the tether.<p>Ultimately, bicycle helmets are unimportant. They prevent a very small number of head injuries at relatively high inconvenience. The best and most cost-effective improvements to cyclist safety are driver and rider training, which prevents accidents in the first place.",1345035890

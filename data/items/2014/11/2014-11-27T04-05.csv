8666055,comment,8663620,8665853,0,0,vishnugupta,,,"This! You are my hero for putting it so eloquently and clearly in no uncertain terms!<p>I was deeply confused and disturbed, as a growing up child, when I watched the grand old Bheeshma getting riddled with arrows that Arjuna fired from behind Shikhandi in Mahabharata serial. And then there was Krishna egging him on. I tried my best but there was no way I could reconcile with &quot;Pandavas + Krishna&quot; being just with Bheeshma getting killed in such a brutal manner. For those who don&#x27;t know; Bheeshma is a central figure in Mahabharata, who lives through the entire period (more or less) and greatly suffers as a result. In the end he dies a brutal death.<p>When I grew up I did read Bhagawadgeeta, various interpretations of it. It vaguely made sense; that everyone on Kaurava&#x27;s side had accumulated bad karmas so they needed to be punished and so on. But still there was some void, all the justifications advanced for war seemed eerily familiar to that of Iraq war. It was at this point that I started reading Ambedkar&#x27;s literature and all of a sudden lot of things made sense. Be it Karma theory to justify lower casts, violence on minority and a bunch of other atrocities; or the institution of &quot;war is justified IF....&quot;.<p>Now, I just treat Mahabharatha, and Bhagawadgeeta in particular, as one of the most brilliantly devised propaganda tools ever. It has served and continues to serve its purpose of brainwashing generations after generations of Hindu population; and probably a few other religions as well.<p>There&#x27;s a reason Budhism, which originated in India is taught as a footnote in Indian schools. Its philosophy is more or less opposite of Hinduism and is very appealing, logical. If taught right it can have lasting impact on young minds, but no, all you have is Mahabharatha, Ramayana, Bhagawadgeeta and such.<p>Edit: Hidimba -> Shikhandi",1417064287

to be done by the referees. While some (few) mathematicians think that
checking the correctness of the proofs is the main task of the referee, others disagree with this and consider mathematical correctness the problem of the author rather than that of the referee.<p>It later quotes an editor:<p>> There are situations where almost nothing needs be checked (e.g., the
results come from a seminar where the results were checked, or I see
the paper is not too good and then it is useless to check details, or the
author is well-known and it is his concern to submit a correct paper).
There are situations when I insist to check all the procedures (e.g.,
when it concerns good results from a less known author).<p>See how it&#x27;s assumed that the author&#x27;s reputation is used as a proxy for the quality of the paper?<p>It also quotes an opinion piece by Nathanson:<p>> Many great and important theorems don&#x27;t actually have proofs. They
have sketches of proofs, outlines of arguments, hints and intuitions that were obvious to the author (at least, at the time of writing) and that, hopefully, are understood and believed by some part of the mathematical community. But the community itself is tiny. In most fields of mathematics there are few experts. [. . .] In every field, there are `bosses&#x27; who proclaim the correctness or incorrectness of a new result, and its importance or unimportance. Sometimes they disagree, like gang leaders fighting over turf. In any case, there is a web of semi-proved theorems throughout mathematics.<p>and it reports questionnaire results sent to math journal editors asking if they require verification of all of the proof, or only partial verification: &quot;six editors thought that the referee should check all proofs in detail; five thought that the referee should check some proofs in detail&quot;, and one of he six actually commented &quot;but to be reasonable, I am happy when I find a referee doing [the latter].&quot;<p>These comments seem to contradict the statement that &quot;peer review is actually where you verify results&quot;.<p>Also, not all non-math/science papers involve &quot;verification through experimentation.&quot; It&#x27;s hard to verify through experiment a report of the neutrino interactions observed from supernova 1987A.",1417064094

Hinduism is not &#x27;a religion&#x27; if one goes by the notion of a religion in Abarahamic religions. It is worse than trying to map git commands to subversion. Its a very different beast, it is a meta religion (or more accurately a diverse collection of a very large body of thought and introspection, originating from a geographical region and built over time, that visitors clubbed into a single pool because they werent sure what to make of it). It is more like a religion factory pattern for building your own religion that includes questions you should keep visiting in that process, and a more fundamental one, why at all (and when) should one even consider building one. It lays down thought processes, questions that one should consider and critique when one is forming ones own parameterized religion. People get confused whether they are talking about the polymorphic class or the object instance.<p>> a lot of advaita scholars maintain that the original Gita was much smaller<p>Not only that, you may completely ignore everything that is in the Gita and still be a Hindu. As long as your belief system is not in conflict with the Vedic philosophy you have a perfectly legit claim to be one. And this gives you enormous amounts of personal space to form your own set of rules and live by them. I am sure you would know but for the benfit of those unfamiliar with the details, the &#x27;Bhakti&#x27; that the article talks about is very much a post Gita thing, had little to no role in Hinduism prior to it. This &quot;one book&quot; obsession is very much an Abrahamic response to try and map something unfamiliar to something familiar. I find it quite amusing.",1417063768

8666023,comment,8665174,8665995,0,0,jjoonathan,,,"He&#x27;s annoyed that the HDL doesn&#x27;t describe the entirety of a typical FPGA &quot;program&quot;. Some things just can&#x27;t be emulated efficiently by the FPGA fabric (or they are common enough patterns that it would be wasteful to do so) and the workaround that has become the de-facto standard is to include &quot;ASIC chunks&quot; in the middle of all the programmable gates. For instance, you might have a serial output that runs at 10Gbps while the rest of the FPGA runs at 500MHz. To bridge the gap between the slower programmable logic and the fast transceiver you need a shift register. The way you specify this in code is by importing a vendor-specific &quot;library&quot; -- except it&#x27;s not really a HDL library at all, it&#x27;s a black box that the proprietary back-end hooks up to to the &quot;ASIC chunks&quot; at compile time.<p>It&#x27;s like compiling against a binary library, except that the binary isn&#x27;t another piece of software, it&#x27;s an etched pattern on your FPGA&#x27;s wafer. Even if you did have the &quot;source code&quot; it wouldn&#x27;t do you any good unless you have a foundry in your backyard :-)<p>I&#x27;m skeptical of the calls for a higher level of abstraction. How are you going to abstract away the fact that the FPGA has exactly 2 embedded memory controllers that have precisely A, B, and C inputs and X, Y, and Z outputs? Either you come up with a solution that&#x27;s effectively just as ugly as what we have now (because it exposes the FPGA&#x27;s resources explicitly) or you come up with a solution that hides these details and as a result becomes enormously fragile because it&#x27;s easy to accidentally change something that prevents the compiler from inferring which embedded ASIC chunk you meant to use.

The interpretation of the vyas ramayana and the south indian Kamba Ramayanam are different.<p>In general, the ramayana and the mahabharata are two epics, and thereby occupy a singificant mindshare in popular culture - so you can argue that it is pan-Indian. But if we veer away from them and go into other books, the differences are even more stark.<p>I actually love this part of &quot;hinduism&quot; - the fact that there is no &quot;one-true-way&quot; has given rise to a whole bunch of fairly conflicting theology that is really interesting. For example, explaining Advaita non-dualism to a conventional &quot;hindu&quot; is really interesting - because the concepts of the Gita are thrown out of the window (a lot of advaita scholars maintain that the original Gita was much smaller).",1417062956

We were known for being one of the cheapest (if not the cheapest) ISP&#x27;s in New York City.<p>Back then if you wanted a machine on the network, you&#x27;d get a 10MB uplink to a T-3 (which was better speed than a lot of the other low-tiers).  A port fee was $500 a month to be able to transfer 1 gig a month, up to $3000 to transfer 100 gigs a month.  Then you&#x27;d have to lease a machine as well.<p>Nowadays, I can get a 125MB uplink on Linode, with 2000 gigs allowed a month - for $10 a month.  No lease for a machine - the VPS comes with it for free - and is much faster, has more storage, memory etc. than anything I could have gotten for a reasonable price back then.<p>It costs next to nothing to put a product out nowadays.   Google Play and the App Store.  100 million people want to download your app from Google Play?  No worries - it&#x27;s hosted on their infrastructure.<p>Aside from that things like Github are around.  There are open source libraries that do everything, and with foreign function interface you can use libraries from almost any language.  A lot of your coding is done for you.  A lot of what I do is hooking two libraries up together, put a UI on it, and then maybe a little bit of my own code.  Voila, a product.<p>I have no idea why anyone who can code would feel dependent on investors.<p>Get in a hurry to where you, or you and your co-founder(s), are &quot;ramen profitable&quot;, and then devote yourself 100% to building up revenue and getting product/market fit.<p>In high school, I used to have to sneak into the Columbia University engineering library to read the 1978 Bell System Technical Journal articles about how Unix worked.

8665944,comment,8662747,8664150,0,0,crowding,,,"In WA where I am, and I believe in CA, standing on the curb facing the crosswalk != using a crosswalk. Standing around looking like you might use the crosswalk someday doesn&#x27;t mean anything; using the crosswalk (and having right of way) starts only from the moment they step off the sidewalk. The WA code makes this pretty clear; CA uses the specific phrase &quot;withinin a crosswalk&quot; which makes me believe the interpretation is the same there.<p>So waving through someone who&#x27;s not actively crossing is not correctly yielding the right of way. OTOH, drivers should bloody well expect pedestrians to start crossing in front of them when you haven&#x27;t stopped yet (both states say that a pedestrian may not step out if there is inadequate room for the car to react and stop; by the contrapositive a pedestrian may step out in front of a car if there is adequate distance.)",1417061225

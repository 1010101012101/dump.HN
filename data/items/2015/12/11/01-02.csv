I&#x27;m honestly curious, so I hope this doesn&#x27;t come across as a digital call-out of some kind.<p>To elaborate, I feel like a lot of people don&#x27;t pay for news, or written content, because they expect (and can get it) for free. That doesn&#x27;t mean they&#x27;re not good potential widget customers.<p>I&#x27;m curious as to what kind of inferences advertisers make / have made about users based on their specific spending patterns. For example, while I&#x27;m sure that generally speaking someone who pays for service X may be more likely than average to pay for service Y, I would also expect that variance to grow or shrink a lot depending on the specific circumstances.",1449799187

10715028,comment,10712446,10714921,0,0,mccourt,,,"I need a bit of clarification here.  In the list of length 100, each entry in that list is a binomial random variable X~Binom(10, .5).  The variance of each of these binomials is Var(X) = 10(.5)(.5) = 2.5.<p>But I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s the variance you&#x27;re talking about.  Do you mean the sample variance of the list of length 100?  I&#x27;m sure that we can figure that out too (or at least what it should look like) but I want to confirm that&#x27;s the variance you are interested in.  Off the top of my head, I think this sample variance should have a roughly Chi-Square distribution, since Binom(10, .5) is close to normal (sort of).  In the Wikipedia article, it explains how Chi-Square can be expressed a sum of normals squared (<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chi-squared_distribution"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chi-squared_distribution</a>).  I could maybe figure out the actual distribution if you really need it.<p>Then you ask what should the distribution look like?  Is this answered by the answer above, or did you mean something related to the 50 samples in particular?",1449798741

If I were OK with spouting off whatever comes to mind without grounding it to scripture, I&#x27;m putting my thoughts on equal (or even greater) footing than the Bible. I <i>am</i> tempted to be this proud at times, but I aspire to be more humble than that.<p>Why the Bible is true has a few answers:<p>1. It has proven to hold a lot of counter-intuitive truth in my life. When I follow the teaching in the Bible, things go better for my and the people I love. Of course, you don&#x27;t know me, so it&#x27;s probably not a very convincing thing to hear from a stranger on the internet.<p>2. The teachings of the Bible are a very complete and internally consistent, which is a quality you would expect from a Holy Book, but is surprisingly absent from many (most?) life philosophies, in my opinion.<p>3. There is a lot of discussion of the history and archaeology of the Bible by John Piper. He does a very thorough breakdown in a five-part sermon series complete with notes (in case you want to read instead of watch video). <a href=""http://www.desiringgod.org/messages/why-we-believe-the-bible-part-1"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.desiringgod.org/messages/why-we-believe-the-bible...</a><p>----------------<p>> Do you care about the consequences of your opinions...?<p>Of course. Though I&#x27;m having a hard time understanding exactly what your question means. Perhaps you are asking if I think the material world is important? The answer to that specific question is also yes.<p>A scriptural basis for this is the story of the resurrection of Lazarus. In the story, Jesus knew He would raise Lazarus from the dead. But he took time to mourn with the family of Lazarus. If the physical world was unimportant, mourning a physical death wouldn&#x27;t make sense. <a href=""https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%2011"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%2011</a><p>I suppose you could also be asking if I think I&#x27;ll get blowback for my opinions? I consider that likely, actually. But if I let personal concerns take precedence over my loyalty to God, then how much do I really believe that God is real, powerful, and loving? I&#x27;ve been lonely and poor before. I&#x27;d rather go back to that than reject the person who means the most to me.",1449796675

Hence their board.<p>The Washington Post published a very interesting article earlier this month, in which they used email correspondence to reveal that Theranos pitched their system to the military, but there were concerns from a DoD official about it.[1]<p>>An official evaluating Theranos’s signature blood-testing technology for the Department of Defense sounded the alarm in 2012 and launched a formal inquiry with the Food and Drug Administration about the company’s intent to distribute its tests without FDA clearance<p>Holmes contacted General Mattis, who had been promoting Theranos within the military, and he tried to bypass the concerns. In the end, Theranos never demonstrated the system to the military. Mattis joined their board a year later.<p>>According to a Theranos spokeswoman, Mattis and Holmes met in 2011 at a Marine Memorial event. Mattis, busy overseeing the war in Afghanistan as commander of the U.S. Central Command, expressed interest in testing Theranos’s technology in combat areas, according to the e-mails.<p>>“I’ve met with my various folks and we’re kicking this into overdrive,” Mattis wrote to Holmes in June 2012. “I’m convinced that your invention will be a game-changer for us and I want it to be given the opportunity for a demonstration in-theater soonest.”<p>>He urged Holmes to call or e-mail him if she felt they needed to talk.<p>>A month later, frustrated by the military regulatory expert who had contacted the FDA, Holmes took him up on that offer.<p>>“I know how incredibly busy you are but thought it was the right thing to let you know the following,” Holmes wrote.<p>>She noted that a deputy director working for a division of the military that oversees regulatory issues and compliance had launched a formal inquiry to regulators without warning Theranos.<p>>“I would very much appreciate your help in getting this information corrected with the regulatory agencies,” Holmes wrote in the e-mail to Mattis. “Since this misinformation came from within DoD, it will be invaluable if this information is formally corrected by the right people in DoD.”<p>>Within hours, Mattis forwarded the exchange to military officials, asking “how do we overcome this new obstacle.”<p>>“I have tried to get this device tested in theater asap, legally and ethically,” Mattis wrote. “This appears to be relatively straight-forward yet we’re a year into this and not yet deployed.”<p>>The field demonstration Mattis was seeking never took place.<p>[1] <a href=""https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2015/12/02/internal-emails-reveal-concerns-about-theranoss-fda-compliance-date-back-years/?postshare=3491449147304325&tid=ss_tw"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2015/12/02/inter...</a>",1449796657

For example, in Romania, Stephen the Great had a habit of celebrating victories over the Ottomans by building new churches and monasteries [1]. These still form the country&#x27;s landmarks and pilgrimage points today, and Stephen is a celebrated hero.<p>Basically many nations have linked their national identities to resisting waves of the &quot;Musulman&quot;.

About once a week around 2 or 3 AM for a few months. I took pictures documenting all the action and gave them to the police. When the police arrived in time to find the screaming drug addicts outside my window, they were just as you describe: incredibly polite, and ineffective.

Tribalism is one of those built in human behaviors we have that we can&#x27;t get rid of. People have tried with globalism, with cultural marxism, with communism. The pendulum always swings back toward tribalism because genetics is a powerful force. Nations are the people, not the dirt, as is pretty obvious to see after 3 decades of mass immigration.<p>If you want real danger, you should want to curb and reverse the mass immigration we&#x27;re still seeing. History is very clear on this point; if immigration continues unabated, eventually the immigrants will become targets.

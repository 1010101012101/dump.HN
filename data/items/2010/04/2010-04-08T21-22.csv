A VC is sizing you up and wants to know why you didn't finish. You're a different person at 30 than you are at 21, so it shouldn't matter, but you fear admitting the truth will kill the deal; VC's a bit of an Ivy snob.

1251128,comment,1250959,1250959,0,0,pw0ncakes,,,"Tough call, but here's the reality of business: everyone ends up ""lying"", even the people who do their best to be honest (those tend to fall into the overconfidence camp). Some people are just overconfident or have sunny reflections on the past, but everyone lies, and mostly about things of no consequence-- why they left their last job, who they know, their relative rank and responsibility in previous companies.<p>I generally assume that it's okay to lie if it doesn't lead the other person into a decision that will bring them harm, so lies to inflate one's social standing are generally okay, but promises to deliver a product that one cannot I'd consider very unethical, because the other person is going to get burned when it doesn't come through.<p>An obvious example is engaging in ""creative career repair"" with respect to previous job changes. Anyone who has spent 28 minutes in the professional world knows that most people do this and that it's generally innocuous. Everyone has a certain degree of the right to reinvent his or her own history. General rule: it's unethical to claim skills you don't have-- and it's also terrible for you because it means you're likely to fail at your next job; it's fine to upgrade titles, relative performance, terms of leaving, status within the group, and compensation to a reasonable degree (up to the maximum given to someone of your standing and seniority, e.g. claiming top bonus).<p>Also, although I think it could be a tactical mistake, I'd have no problem with someone lying about having more VC interest in a venture than there actually is, in order to get better terms. This ""lie"" makes a good deal more attention-getting, but it's not going to make a bad deal look like a good one, except to a VC who doesn't do his own homework. (The danger is that the VC will scumbag you and, behind your back, call up the VC you said was interested.)",1270763490
1251127,comment,1250595,1250746,0,0,Zev,,,"My understanding of what Adobe was doing is that they're using LLVM to output the necessary ARM binary directly, not going to C/Objective-C and then using the standard tools by Apple to make the binary. It is probably worth noting that Apple doesn't even use LLVM/Clang for the iPhone yet; you still have to use gcc-4.2 to build your app.<p>What I'm curious about is what Adobe is that makes binaries much larger than the size it would be if it was in ObjC. As an example, the binary for Trading Stuff (only picked on because it is free) is 14.1MB. Thats rather ridiculous; I don't think I've ever come across an app written in ObjC for the iPhone that was 1.4MB.<p>And looking at the reviews for Trading Stuff, it doesn't seem like the app performs very well. Of course, that could be due it being written poorly. But, my initial inclination is to think otherwise.",1270763486

It took our team less than half the time to develop our WebOS app as our other native apps, and it's more stable than when they were first released. The downside is mostly performance. WebOS apps are built upon so many layers of abstraction and interpretation, they are significantly slower than native apps on the same hardware.<p>That doesn't matter if everything your app does is trivial and not intensive, but it's pretty limiting.

In this case, I can see it as justified.<p>2 - If it's specifically to target cross-compilers as a business decision, to ensure that iPhone only gets ""exclusives"", then I suppose it's their prerogative. It will probably backfire long-term, as their market share isn't <i>that</i> dominant.

        Two - ZOO - You're vising a zoo and standing buy a monkey cage. You throw a banana at the monkey and monkey throws back a bouquet of ROSES.<p>#3 Arouse in the other person an eager want :
        Three - TREE- You're in front of the Rockefeller Christmas tree. All of a sudden, the tree falls to the ground and there is a WANTED poster with your picture on top of it.<p>#4 Become genuinely interested in other people :
        Four - DOOR - You're walking out of a grand hotel, through their revolving door, when the door gets stuck in a stack of 25% INTEREST bearing treasury notes :)<p>#5 Smile :
        Five - HIVE - You're out hiking and come across this huge cave, with a gigantic bee hive on it, with bees buzzing around it. Out that bee hive, sticks out a big yellow SMILEY face.<p>#6 Remember that a person's name is to that person the sweetest and most important sound in any language :
        Six - SICK- You're sick and are admitted to the hospital. The nurse brings the syringe and it is about 10 feet tall with a 3 feet needle attached to it. Out of the needle a NAME PLATE is dripping out.<p>#7 Be a good listener :
        Seven - HEAVEN - You look up and see something coming down. It's a flight of stairs. Tumbling down the stairs, is a pair of old HEAD PHONES, that are huge.<p>#8 Talk in terms of the other person's interests :
        Eight - GATE - You're about to cross a railway gate. The bells start ringing and the gate comes down on the bonnet with a thud. Attached to the gate is a MICROPHONE.<p>#9 Make the other person feel important - and do it sincerely:

It gets around 200 email per day (that's around 8 emails/hour).<p>- Apart from the usual email, I have few other emails with domains (like support@mydomain.com). I use Google apps for them and I forward all emails that I receive from these domains to the main ordinary Gmail Email.<p>Benefits:<p>- The ordinary email works like a repository for all my emails. By checking it, I check all emails I have.<p>- The domains emails make it easier for me to arrange emails and keep a record of them. For example, I'm using a separate email address for my PayPal account. This keeps a record of all received or sent payments. In the same time, when I get a payment, the email show up on my primary email and then I get notified without the need to check all my in-boxes.<p>Usage:<p>1- When at home (my office), I run Gtalk full time (rarely my friends nudge me). When I get an email, GTalk pops up a box. I quickly read the email title. If it's the usual spam (80% of my emails are useless), I just ignore it, if it's an important one, I pause work and open my mail box.<p>2- When outside doors, I use my mobile to check emails. Doesn't have a regular checking time, but when I feel I want to check I check. If there is an important email, I read it; but most of the time reply when I get back home.<p>3- I sleep like all humans. When I wake up, the first thing I do (before anything) is running my netbook, check emails, reply or read and then archive them all. My inbox is now empty!

Lots of activities you do offline could be considered a waste of time too but, if you enjoy doing it, that's basically what life is for most people. Moderation is probably a much more reasonable way to deal with it.",1270760481

It's not clear how easy that'd be to enforce, though.",1270760423

At this point, the object code is the same (or functionally the same in terms of its syscalls, library calls, and general program flow) as if I had originally written it in C, except that I would have lost the unique developer efficiencies I got from using Scheme in the first place. I'm not saying Scheme is better or should be an officially sanctioned source language for the iPhone SDK. I'm just saying, where the rubber meets the road -- object code linking against libraries and making certain calls -- there is no difference to the computer what the original source was.<p>Seems very silly.",1270760408

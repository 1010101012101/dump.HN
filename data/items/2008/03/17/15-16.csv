Just because you're an ""average"" user you should not be settling on junk, otherwise an argument can be made for buying a 5 year old used PCs for $100 on ebay.<p>For starters, Windows is barely usable on high-DPI screens. Their UIs don't scale, the graphics does not scale, the font rendering is still tuned for 72dpi.<p>Second, Windows users automatically get sacks of junkware pre-installed from ""friends from Dell"". My Lenovo T60p came with a crippled wireless because of trial versions of some ""protective"" software that I had to remove (online forums were full of cries).<p>My friend has cut a finger once by touching an edge of a Dell laptop. It happened 3 years ago and new Inspirons are better. Now he is getting ""A Message from Logitech!"" bubble in the corner of his screen every couple of weeks.<p>And finally, Windows with is antiquated window management is simply no match for Mac as far as productivity is concerned.",1205769358

Their upside comes from investment profits. They take 2% of the fund per year, whether or not the fund makes money. If it doesn't they may have trouble raising an additional fund but that's a different question. Angel groups have a much different structure (e.g. Band of Angels, Angels Forum) where each individual investor contributes a set amount to a particular investment.",1205769271

138959,comment,138508,138700,0,0,nostrademons,,,"The Federal Reserve was created after the panic of 1907, because J.P. Morgan (ironic, isn't it) single handedly stopped the panic by buying out the second-most-bankrupt bank (he let the worst one fail).  He was the only one in the U.S. who could do so; the Federal Government had no mandate to intervene in economic matters.  After the crash, a bunch of congressmen decided it probably wasn't a good idea to have the nation's fiscal health in the hands of one man who was looking out for his own interests above those of the nation, and so they created the Fed to serve as the lender of last resort.<p>A similar situation existed in Europe, where the Rothschilds functioned as the lenders of last resort to the kings and queens of Europe.  Because of their special relationship with the rulers, they made obscene profits through superior access to information and special interest rates.  European central banking is largely a reaction against the concentration of so much power in private hands.<p>A connected elite will <i>always</i> rip off the population at large.  There seems to be no way around it; if you cut off one government organization, some robber baron will just grow into the role.  Nature abhors a vacuum.  It's better to know who the demons are and have some semblance of nominal regulation to keep them honest.<p>BTW, Andrew Jackson and Thomas Paine were demagogues, much like Ron Paul and Pat Buchanan are today.  Their goal is to form a new connected elite by preying off the passions and fears of the population.  Never underestimate the power of stupid people in large groups, and all that.",1205768171

Seasoned investors have seen recessions before, and just switch to investments that provide the best reward.  I think as a credit crunch exists, I think competition for those funds will become slimmer because less people can afford to take the risk of a startup which means it will be easier to get those funds.<p>You may actually see more funds available than normal.

138945,comment,138508,138667,0,0,jdavid,,,"i doubt we would have seen 7-8% unemployment.  the US wines when unemployment reaches 4%.  Typically in recessions large companies lay people off to protect share price and free up cash.  It's just an excuse to shareholders to let go some of the spending.  If companies were to cut spending in a boom time shareholders would speculate that something bad was going to happen.<p>in recessions labor prices return to market value, and entrepreneurs like us can afford to hire talent.<p>the best indicator of an economic down turn is a cut in R&D, and from what I can tell engineering salaries are still increasing right now.<p>I think the thing to do, instead of bailing out homeowners with low interest rates is to provide a free education.  we are in a full blown knowledge economy and EVERYONE will have to make the transition sooner or later.",1205766732

The consensus was that Private Equity firms (or those that invest large sums of money) will get hit much more than VCs, and as a result the bigger the startup the more at risk you are. I also recall that Morten Lund claimed in the panel that a recession might prove to be beneficial (at least as far as Angels are concerned), because according to him, it will separate the great startups from the mediocre ones.<p>In my opinion, a strong recession, might cause valuation to go down, but it shouldn't affect early stage startup too much, because their backers usually look at a long term investment period.",1205766086

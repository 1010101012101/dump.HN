My online EHR through Kaiser is completely unusable, and according to the people who evaluate these things, it's supposed to be one of the best. [1]<p>Last week I was at the doctor twice, and both times the doctors were complaining about their EHR software, once because it takes so long to boot up, and the other time because it takes longer to sort through allergy testing results in digital form than it used to take with paper charts.<p>The problem is, the incentive structure in place forces docs to either adopt what's out there or miss out on big incentives, and eventually get penalized [2]. This creates a twisted incentive structure for software companies where they basically can capitalize on the fact that the docs have to adopt a system. All the software company has to do is put out something that's compliant with gov't standards, even if its totally unusable by doctors. Just take a look at the website of the company touted as a great example of the success of the gov't incentive program in the article: <a href=""http://www.medfx.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.medfx.com/</a> Would this pass muster in the consumer internet space? In enterprise SAAS? Not a chance.<p>So the startups are incentivized to get something out so they can get in on the scheme before the window of opportunity closes, what about the big companies who have been building these systems for years? Well, they make most of their revenue from implementing, training, and maintaining systems, not from licensing software, so their incentives are to sell contracts, not make their software any better, because that ends up hurting their bottom line [3]. All they have to do is maintain relative parity with emerging companies, and get real, real good at sales.<p>It's really a shame, because there is enormous room for real innovation in this space. There is a truly incredible amount valuable data is siloed off in these systems, thats sometimes not even available to the physicians themselves [4] let alone researchers who could use the data. And that, of course, is not mention the potential to help doctors spend less time wrestling with charts, and more time caring for their patients.<p>[1] <a href=""http://thesash.me/who-will-fix-the-ux-of-healthcare-a-3-trillio"" rel=""nofollow"">http://thesash.me/who-will-fix-the-ux-of-healthcare-a-3-tril...</a><p>[2] <a href=""https://www.cms.gov/Regulations-and-Guidance/Legislation/EHRIncentivePrograms/index.html?redirect=/EHRIncentivePrograms/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.cms.gov/Regulations-and-Guidance/Legislation/EHR...</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://thesash.me/who-will-fix-the-ux-of-healthcare-a-3-trillio-44611"" rel=""nofollow"">http://thesash.me/who-will-fix-the-ux-of-healthcare-a-3-tril...</a><p>[4] My dad had to hire a consultant to make updates to his EHR system so that he could run queries for certain things among <i>his own patients</i>",1341283717

Relating back to a common topic here, one of the things that distinguishes between senior engineers and not senior engineers in my experience is the ability to visualize both secondary and tertiary consequences of a particular change to the system. They stop and say ""Ok, we change this, that means ..."" and then walk forward past the change in their mind exploring the ramifications. In order to do that they have to have a broad understanding of the system involved from both a technical and operational perspective. They come back with ""Oh if we do that then we'll get this effect and that would be bad, how can we prevent that from happening?"" and if the answer was ""We can't."" then they spike the feature.<p>One of the most frustrating things for me as an engineer at Sun early on was bouncing some whiz bang idea off Bill Joy only to get one of his one line zinger 'but that breaks X' type replies. Always annoying but often right as he would take what was proposed, extrapolate two, three, or a half dozen steps and then point out the now 'obvious' flaw.",1341283233

This is unfortunate, but it is how basically any language (that I know) save Haskell would do it.<p>So instead of having a return function, you would use something like List.return or Maybe.return or whatever. This is the same way you would solve the problem of read (that is, the opposite of toString): Double.parse, Integer.parse and so on. When you have a polymorphic function, you would pass in the type as appropriate.<p>Clearly, this is not ideal. However, this is basically what the Haskell compiler does for you with typeclasses--loosely speaking, a function polymorphic over a typeclass gets transformed into a function accepting an instance and its normal arguments.<p>In OCaml, you could solve this problem with a functor. So your polymorphic module is parametrized on another module that provides the return and bind functions. I personally like this approach less than Haskell's, but it is more flexible (for better or worse): you can have different modules passed in for the same type. In Haskell, to get different behavior for the same type using typeclasses, you'd have to create a new type with newtype.<p>So in short, it isn't impossible: you just have to do more manually than you do in Haskell.",1341282636

We have actually been in touch with the Virginia ABC since the start to make sure nobody gets in trouble as a result of this site.  The laws are in place because Virginia is afraid of underage drinking, and they believe that drink specials encourage underage kids to drink (of course, they wouldn't be able to get <i>into</i> the bars, but that doesn't seem to concern the legislature).  As long as the drink specials are advertised in a responsible manner, the state doesn't seem to have a problem with it.

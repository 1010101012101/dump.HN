We want to have a theory based on early data (since there <i>will</i> be a policy, whether explicit or not, so better to base it on our best ideas to date), but it&#x27;s early and we don&#x27;t really know what we&#x27;re doing.  Then we get better data and better theories and voila!  New consensus, better theory, better policies (in theory ;-).<p>Maybe advocate more open-mindedness so paradigm shifts don&#x27;t require extinction of the proponents of the previous theory?  Or strive for more policy responsiveness to scientific discoveries (I guess it&#x27;s pretty clear this would be a Good Thing)?<p>I think structurally encouraging policies to be built around actual scientific consensus and data (and to keep up with the field) could go a long way.",1444841935

  >>> # impossible in Python unless using ultra-complex Numpy stride tricks.

  > dim(someMatrix)
  >>> someMatrix.shape
  > head(someMatrix)
  >>> someMatrix.head() # notice consistent function application in R, whereas in Python, mixed attribute / function? So we&#x27;re on OO land and I must know if it&#x27;s an attribute or a function....

  >>> Impossible in python without For loop as lambdas cannot be multi-statement. 

  > native indexing using [] brackets by index number, or index value, or boolean. All vectors.
  >>> pandas loc/iloc/ix mess.

  > ordered lists (python dict) by default, so boolean or index subsection easy even when data is hierarchical, not tabular
  >>> easy bugs due to unordered nature of dicts; must import some different module and then still can&#x27;t vector index it.

And then there&#x27;s CRAN. Just last night someone told me about &quot;nowcasting&quot; which uses &quot;MIDAS regression&quot;. A relatively new technique. Google it for R (full package available), Google it for Python (Matlab comes up ;-).<p>And I&#x27;m not even going to start on graphics. Seaborn and bokeh are valiant efforts, but they&#x27;re still 80% of what ggplot and base graphics can do, especially, at the multidimensional scale. That last 20% is often all the difference between meh and wow. That said, I do appreciate Matplotlib&#x27;s autos rescaling of axes when adding data. Python charts aren&#x27;t as pretty nor capable of complexity (for similar effort), but they&#x27;re arguably more dynamic.<p>Now don&#x27;t get me wrong. The converse list for Python would be much longer, because it&#x27;s more general purpose, and it kills R outside of data science. I wrote 10k loc in R for a semi-production and it was horrible because it does not have the CS tools for managing code complexity, and it really is slow at certain things. R is more focused on iterative, exploratory data science, where it excels.",1444841631

There is no practical experimental set-up that systematically reestablishes all prior knowledge from scratch, so there has to be trust in other scientists and reevaluating that trust must be grinded out the same way we grind out new scientific results: methodically, reproducibly.<p>What is problematic when it comes to humans is how our social structures are organized for doing science. They are hierarchical, resources are controlled centrally, and scientists are forced to compete with each other instead of cooperating with each other. Science is a career. We injure science and scientists by tying up their economic prosperity with their ability to convince the rest of the world that their work is worth anything. This creates a huge incentive to push forward and a huge disincentive to reevaluate past results: Your reputation can be damaged because you might be undermining the legacy of a high status scientist, and if you confirm the past result then you haven&#x27;t done anything new and that reflects poorly on your &#x27;performance&#x27;.<p>Science succeeds in spite of status, institutional monopolies, and hierarchical social organization. It would flourish in a more egalitarian society.<p>Is it intrinsic to humans to be hierarchical and status based? I want to say no. I don&#x27;t think so.

Money now is worth more than money later - and it&#x27;s extremely non-linear, not only with time but it also varies with the amount you have. So any money you don&#x27;t have now corresponds to (literally) exponentially more money you won&#x27;t have in the future, all things being equal. Even a smart person will find this hurdle very difficult, maybe even impossible, to overcome without a large dose of luck.<p>For example, what do you do if your car breaks down? Obviously you get it fixed and then move on with your life.<p>Now, what do you do <i>if you&#x27;re poor</i> and your car breaks down? Assuming we take starving to death off the table, your choices likely boil down to losing your job because you can&#x27;t travel to it or getting a payday loan at an usurious interest rate. Ironically, if you make the conscientious choice then people on internet message boards will call you lazy, whereas if you make the rational choice then people on internet message boards will call you stupid.<p>Whatever you choose will suffice to keep you poor for long enough for your car to break down again - which it will, because at no point would you have had enough money to invest in one that won&#x27;t. Now apply this scenario to absolutely <i>everything</i>, large or small, that you ever have to buy and there is the answer to your question of why the poor haven&#x27;t found a way out of poverty yet: because being poor is <i>much</i> more expensive than not being poor.",1444841241

10387687,comment,10383043,10387091,0,0,pron,,,"One of the basic things to understand in sociology and social psychology is that what people want is often shaped by what they are encouraged to want (and it&#x27;s very easy to make people want something, as verified in psychology experiments). This is why modern feminism doesn&#x27;t concentrate on the &quot;want&quot;. Not because it&#x27;s not important (it&#x27;s very important!), but because it&#x27;s hard to separate cause and effect, especially under an unequal distribution of power. We only look at the result: how power is distributed, and <i>assume</i> that people don&#x27;t &quot;inhernetly&quot; want to have less power than others, as that would mean letting others determine their lives. Of course, this assumption could be wrong, but so far there is no evidence that is the case. Consequently, feminism is not concerned with who &quot;contributes&quot; what to sexism (it is easy to make people want to be subjugated; can they later be said to be contributing to their own subjugation?). Sexism is an objective state of society, not a specific behavior (misogyny is), and when we say that some action is sexist we mean that it contributes to sexism; the action itself can be completely free of any ill intent.",1444841101

Two aspects to the answer.<p>1) Let&#x27;s say the article was about people who fell to their death because there was no fence at the top of the Grand Canyon. Let&#x27;s further suppose that this was a pattern and it has been happening with increasing frequency of late, but it is still rare because the random gusts of wind that push people over the edge are rare, and further that the people falling had no idea that it was a risk posed by touring the Grand Canyon. And then you posted that in fact 294 people fell to their deaths every year but that number includes all the people who were out climbing mountains for sport. That number might be horrific, but the mountain climbers understood the risk and chose to take it. The tourists at the Grand Canyon thought that what they were doing was safe.<p>2) The solution for the one problem likely has nothing to do with the solution for the other. If many of those 294 deaths are because of gang violence or criminal activity, magically removing all guns might reduce that number, but it probably wouldn&#x27;t reduce it much. Someone who is out just to shoot up as many people as possible may well not try to kill anyone if he can&#x27;t get a hold of a gun.

Their women&#x27;s line suffers from overly high prices for what the pieces are (simple stuff that I can buy at Ann Taylor or Loft or Nordstrom or JCrew or Banana Republic depending on my mood and what color I want it in), and the extremely narrow offering of sizes is straight up ridiculous at this point.<p>I&#x27;m not going to drop $150 on any clothing I buy online sight-unseen unless it&#x27;s a brand I already know and trust.

With liquid fuel you can add a little bit of fissionable material as often as you want, so your fuel has barely enough reactivity to keep your plant operating.<p>With solid fuel, the fission products build up over that 18 months. With liquid fuel, three things happen:<p>- Noble gases bubble right out of the fuel to an outgas system. You get a tank of xenon and krypton. You can take that away to secure storage as often as you like.<p>- Some metallic fission products plate onto collectors.<p>- The major fission products we worry about are cesium, strontium, and iodine. In conventional reactors they&#x27;re gases, but in MSRs they bond very strongly into fluoride salts. Optionally we can remove them as we go.<p>So in our imaginary catastrophe there&#x27;s not enough reactivity for a big excursion, there&#x27;s less decay heat than in a conventional reactor, and most of the radioactive stuff is liquid that quickly cools to solid rock. There&#x27;s nothing to drive any kind of explosion, since it&#x27;s all chemically stable and at atmospheric pressure.<p>It&#x27;s worth noting that Fukushima&#x27;s reactor survived a 9.0 earthquake without significant physical damage. It was the loss of electric power that took it out, and that&#x27;s a problem molten salt reactors don&#x27;t have at all.",1444839815

Fortran is a tiny bit more work, still easy enough however.<p>Want multicore or to spread tasks over a cluster?  R has built in functions that do that for you.

In fact I wonder whether he has really experienced a bike for day to day use, because some of the ideas are very strange. It&#x27;s telling that most bikes in the pictures are racing bikes. What&#x27;s the advantage of bikes in apartment buildings? Why not park the bike at the ground floor? It would waste a lot of space in the corridors. Think about what you&#x27;d rather have: 2 meters extra apartment, or 2 meters extra wide corridor.<p>Bikes in shops will not work either. Walking through a shop with a bike seems extremely unwieldy; you would need much larger space between the shelves. A bike in your hand makes it hard to pick up things from the shelves. A bike does not stay upright by itself when you go to pick up something from the shelves, so you have to park it with that thing that I don&#x27;t know the English name of. Even then, if you load the bike with a bag of groceries it usually falls over. When you are walking on one side of your bike it&#x27;s hard to reach over your bike while not falling over. Bike parking space is a non-problem compared to car parking space. No cars whatsoever is unrealistic even in bike utopia. How do you move big and heavy things?

In particular, Europe lags significantly in &quot;on-line&quot; services.<p>Obviously it would solve some problems if this were not the case. However, given that for now it <i>is</i> the case, the price of enforcing a total ban on exporting personal data outside Europe would be closing down vast numbers of on-line European small businesses that aren&#x27;t intentionally doing anything unreasonable or customer-hostile. Clearly this isn&#x27;t going to be accepted readily by anyone involved.<p>A more realistic result when the dust has settled might be yet another disclosure that businesses are required to make prominently when someone buys or signs up for something, in order to be deemed to have explicit consent from the data subject to export the data. This appears at first sight to be a reasonable way to handle the ruling, and in principle I think it&#x27;s hard to argue with requiring a business to disclose fairly what they&#x27;re really doing with personal data. Indeed, I&#x27;ve noticed that in recent years organisations like my insurers have started adding terms that explicitly say they&#x27;re going to export personal data and foreign governments might get access to it, and that if you want to deal with them at all then you have to accept that. (I&#x27;m not sure how I feel about such conditions when having the insurance is mandatory by law, as for example with motor insurance for drivers, and based on my experience so far it looks like literally everyone offering such insurance is now imposing similar conditions.)<p>Then again, for on-line businesses at least, isn&#x27;t that what privacy policies have evolved to deal with? Separate to this case, under the new consumer protection rules, it seems likely that such policies would now be considered to fall under the same general rules about fairness and transparency as the main terms of a consumer contract. Assuming that is true, I&#x27;m not sure there is a huge advantage in cluttering up on-line order/sign-up forms with explicit wording about routine things, while there is certainly a disadvantage in making such forms any more complicated than they need to be. The question then becomes one of reasonable expectations about what a normal customer would consider routine.<p>I suppose that brings us back to approximately where we came in, other than the fact that it&#x27;s now a matter of public record that the US government itself was violating those reasonable expectations and opened Pandora&#x27;s box. Somehow I suspect that if some sort of basic disclosure/consent on sign-up doesn&#x27;t deal with this issue, it will be addressed by adjusting the relevant European-level legislation so that disclosure to allied governments in the interests of national security is a blanket exemption, and enough people won&#x27;t know or care about the implications that this will pass even though privacy advocates would surely oppose it.",1444839301

high end of a <i>consumer grade</i>
mid-tower case, e.g., an AMD
8 core processor, 32 GB of ECC

on a current motherboard 
for less than $150 or so running
Windows Server or maybe, 
initially, just Windows 7 Pro.<p>Keep that on average half busy
24 x 7 for a month, and I will
be able to afford more.<p>If I get, say, two wire rack shelf units
18 x 48 x 72&quot;, fill them with
a good router and mid tower
cases, and keep all that 
on average half busy 24 x 7,
then I will consider
a colocation facility or the
cloud.<p>A few miles from me is
a nicely big, fully serious
colocation facility
that offers dual 10 GbE 
Internet connections, etc.<p>No joke:  One of those shelf
units has room for about 12 
mid tower cases.  Keep two
such shelf units busy, and that
will max out what I&#x27;m willing
to pursue without a lot more
<i>server farm</i> expertise than
I have (or want to get) 
and also make cash not
a problem.<p>So, one hope is that I will be
able to pay some experts, two
or three days at a time, to
hold my hand into more --
reliable electrical power,
HVAC, floor space, cabling, racks, 
servers for the racks, 
internals of the servers for
the racks, e.g., maybe Xeon,
automation for software
installation, system management,
system monitoring,
farm performance analysis,
fail-over, virtual machine 
exploitation, security,
test systems, development
systems, organized 
code repository and testing,
all relevant documentation,
training, recruiting, 
HR, legal, real estate leasing,
janitorial, physical security,
etc.  Or, right, just use
a cloud!<p>But for the high end Xeon 
processors, I&#x27;m looking
ahead.  E.g., a motherboard
with two Xeons with 18 cores each,
all in just one full tower case,
or two for failover, or
three considering testing,
might provide enough 
computing for my startup
all the way to exit so that
I could avoid taking seriously

So rather than delaying, you can address it in a way that makes it clear information needs to go both ways.<p>I read an article from a real estate agent about negotiating, and he had a pretty clever answer to a common question.  He said people would often ask &quot;would your clients take 10% below asking?&quot;.  His answer &quot;make an offer!&quot;  That certainly is one way to find out.<p>It&#x27;s a good answer.  The agent explained that what people are trying to do here is get information for free, without committing to anything themselves, yet the answer accomplishes this not by getting preachy or defensive, but by moving the negotiations toward what the agent wants to see most - an offer.<p>That should be your goal when an employer asks you what salary you&#x27;d accept or what your current salary is (a similar question in disguise).  They&#x27;re essentially asking for information without giving you any in return - they now know what you make, but you have no idea what they typically pay.  You could try to stonewall for a while, but I think it&#x27;s better to have an answer that moves toward an offer.  If they ask what your salary is, you could say something like &quot;I work for a small startup right now, so my guess is that a senior software engineer&#x27;s salary at a big company would be higher - what is typical in your organization?&quot;  That way, you haven&#x27;t said &quot;no, I won&#x27;t tell you&quot;, nor have you said &quot;you have to tell me if I&#x27;ll tell you&quot; so bluntly.  What you&#x27;ve done is posed it in a way that moves them toward putting a number onto an offer, and they will have to acknowledge, through their response, that they were actually fishing for free info to give themselves the upper hand here.<p>Now keep in mind, employers are clever, and odds are they do this a lot more than you do (not always, consultants in particular do negotiations more often than their clients).  But keep in mind the principle behind the response &quot;make me an offer.&quot;  It&#x27;s a way to remind the person you&#x27;re negotiating with that they have information <i>you&#x27;d</i> like just as much as you have information <i>they&#x27;d</i> like, and that to get it, they&#x27;re going to need to take a step forward themselves.<p>One more thing, if you&#x27;re desperate for a job, it&#x27;s much harder to do this.  Ideally, you&#x27;d be in a position where you&#x27;d really like a job (if you&#x27;re indifferent, why are you doing this), but coming form a position of relative strength.

I tend to have a lot of sympathy for the ""programming as a tool"" argument and forget the potential that programming languages ultimately have. Programming languages, just like any language, are a means of communicating ideas. As this becomes easier and more expressive it will revolutionize the field, many times over.<p>I think the real problem is that most languages that are made these days are just minuscule iterations over whats currently available. From that perspective there is little to no value in keeping up with whatever monstrosity some overeager researcher squeezes out of their head. But completely new paradigms, or new ways of doing old things, certain have much value; to the programmer learning it and to advancing the field.",1308365863

But I believe much more intuitive forms of programming languages will eventually be made such that your average intelligent user can accomplish non-trivial computation.<p>Programming languages are the computer analog to natural languages. The real problem is that most of our brains aren't wired for programming languages. If we can bridge that gap, that will completely revolutionize the way people interact with computers.",1308365643
2667799,comment,2667761,2667763,1,0,briggers,,,"In site usability, ecommerce, and conversion in general speed is well established as being very important. Google and others have made speed a core goal because their data shows that speed helps conversion.<p>However, I would suggest that site speed is merely a proxy for usability speed. ie. it's more important for conversion to have a form that is easily comprehended and filled out than it is to have a fast loading page.<p>What I'm working up to is the idea that usability speed might be a useful proxy for a high-conversion design. It's also data that can be measured accurately without bias, and can be generated in lieu of real visitors by throwing a horde of disinterested people from Mechanical Turk at (eg.) your sign-up page with a well-defined goal.",1308365510

OCZ shipped SSDs with pre-release firmware, uses a number of different flash chip vendors, and may not test sufficiently prior to release.<p>I'd say buying a reliable SSD is more difficult than buying a HDD since there are quite a few variables, but there is sufficient information available these days to make an informed choice.<p>Performance is really worth it though! I wish there wasn't such a focus on boot times because I only have to reboot my MacBook Pro for certain OS updates or when it crashes, but high performance random IO makes a huge difference in day to day use. Applications launch almost instantly, I can do a find+grep on nested directories containing thousands of files in a fraction of a second, and compile times are pretty much only limited by CPU speed.",1308365445

Whether Microsoft engages with and helps improve WebGL could be seen as a proxy for whether they will in fact engage with Web Standards in IE 1X.  Or is WebGL so broken that it's impossible to contribute?<p>I'm also surprised since the next battleground for browsers seems to be in mobile and pushing forward a unified and seriously advanced browser strategy could be a serious advantage for MSMobile (whatever the hell it's called now).  Instead, they seem to be re-fighting battles in a war that's already been semi-lost (the PC browser).",1308362558

Back when I was running a small team at MSFT, we were the first serious users of the then-new WPF text rendering APIs that were built on top of the new driver models. So, we hit bugs. The ATI on-site folks were awesome. Usually, they had already found the bugs and had a patch that was going through stability testing. When they didn't know about it, one of them would come by, usually within a couple of hours, and connect up a kernel debugger or whatever else was needed to track down the bug and turn us around a fix. I still prefer AMD video cards to this day based on that experience.",1308362453

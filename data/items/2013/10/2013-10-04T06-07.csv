6494091,comment,6488449,6488449,1,0,willyt,,,"A lot of the discussion on this thread has descended into a slanging match about French regulation and work life balance vs US libertarianism and customer service. This is mostly missing the main point which is that Amazon has an unfair advantage because they are large enough to take advantage of loopholes in EU sales tax law to gain a ~15% price advantage over local businesses selling the same products. France can&#x27;t change the sales tax rate of neighbouring countries so they have introduced a new law which is a hack that tries to cancel out this unfair advantage in other ways, and they must be careful to do this without infringing EU competition law. Hence the targeting of certain business practises of &#x27;internet retailers&#x27;.",1380869981
6494090,comment,6492245,6493739,2,0,waps,,,"Everything in nature happens along exponential growth curves, so those years are meaningless. This means that not much appears to happen for long periods (few 100k years at most though), then suddenly exponential growth changes everything. As soon as the growth factor increases I would expect to see massive, unpredictable changes 5-10 generation lengths later, assuming a growth factor of 2.<p>> why is it unreasonable to expect human activities to provide a similar amount of stabilization, even if greater amounts exceed our grasp?<p>Because of thermodynamics. Given that you start from a system that is not in thermodynamic equilibrium (the earth is not, nor would it be desirable if it was), large sudden changes are par for the course, not an exception.<p>There is disagreement on whether it is even possible to halt the changes. You can certainly make the change turn out differently (does not mean better, just different). Thermodynamics takes it as an assumption that it is not (you cannot stabilize (ie. &quot;cool&quot;) a gas by adding energy, no matter how large the amount, you can only let it expand into a larger area or bring it into contact with something much more stable than it is, and you&#x27;ll destabilize the large thing in the process).<p>The causal problem here (in mathematical terms) is that while it is certainly true that &quot;X&quot; caused change &quot;Y&quot;, and that Y is large, the absence of &quot;X&quot; would have lead to an equally large change &quot;Z&quot;. Take for example the &quot;3-body&quot; phenomenon : Take the solar system. Move one 1kg rock in the asteroid belt (or almost anywhere else) 1 meter in any direction. Wait 10000 years. Look at the effect it had. Counterintuitively, planetary orbits will differ significantly as a result of that tiny movement. It won&#x27;t take long for that rock to affect the paths of rocks near it through gravity. The change will grow, and before you know it it significantly affects the paths of the thousands of huge &quot;temporary comets&quot; that get catapulted out of the asteroid belt on a regular basis. A few of those will come close to a moon, and &quot;slingshot&quot; around them, significantly affecting the orbit of said moon, which will affect the path of the planet it&#x27;s orbiting. Any small difference in orbit will build up over time into the positions and orbits of those planets and before you know it, nothing looks alike anymore.",1380869977

6494068,comment,6493934,6493934,13,0,tikhonj,,,"An especially interesting thing about machine learning algorithms is that even understanding the algorithm itself will often tell you nothing about its biases: the biases often come from the training data. The article talks about this a little bit, but I think it&#x27;s a very important point for programmers in particular. For one, this means that even an open source algorithm, with the best intentions, might have significantly detrimental biases.<p>This also explains why I <i>personally</i> do not find machine learning satisfying. It&#x27;s obviously very useful, and I&#x27;m not making a judgement about the field, but I just find solving a problem with machine learning to often feel empty. You get a solution, sure, but you get no additional insight on the problem itself. And I&#x27;m often far more interested in this insight than in any given problem itself.<p>I certainly find the underlying principles fascinating, but that fascination usually does not translate to whatever field machine learning is used for.

Assuming there was no Netflix, et al., it would just drive more gray market piracy. That isn&#x27;t something content providers want. As it happens, DRM or not, piracy happens. I don&#x27;t see this standard changing that.
You are also assuming that there would be no available content without DRM, but if traditional content providers couldn&#x27;t sell their product to consumers anymore, I think it is more likely that non-traditional content providers, those that agree to distribute content that isn&#x27;t encumbered with DRM restrictions, would become more successful. It is a shift from having content force feed to us by corporations, to a system where independent creators have greater exposure.
I don&#x27;t need their content and I&#x27;m less likely to consume it if they insist on locking it up. I do believe in paying for the content I receive, and I would continue to do so if the stream didn&#x27;t have DRM.",1380869185

This number is impossible to calculate, but investors can estimate it with probabilistic models (a discounted cash flow model, taking into account the probabilities of different scenarios).<p>E.g. a simplification of such a model would be to create some plausible-looking probability histogram for the &quot;fundamental&quot; value of the company in 10 years. Many investors believe there is a significant probability that Tesla will be worth >100 billion in 10-15 years, i.e. one of the world&#x27;s major automakers (perhaps one of the largest) due to a global shift to electric vehicles and its 5-year head start and patent moat. It&#x27;s probably worth noting that multiple major analysts have performed such a DCF analysis and arrived at a number in this ballpark.<p>Under these assumptions, a $200-300 share price isn&#x27;t absurd. I can agree it&#x27;s speculative and extrapolating a lot. But on the other hand a $40 price as some analysts are calling for, is IMHO more absurd since it ignores some very likely growth prospects. If companies were always valued on &quot;fundamental&quot; value, buying growth stocks would be guaranteed to make you a massive, market-beating return.",1380868624

One is where you are still committed to the end goal but some things just have to be done in order to achieve it.

175458,comment,175060,175060,0,0,adityakothadiya,,,"Hi all,
I wrote that article because I'm experiencing few things that I wanted to share. I'm working on starting a startup, handling all marriage and day job responsibilities. I find it very challenging, but I still push myself because it's my character flaw - that I want to start a startup. To make this happen, I'm also looking for building a founding team. For that, I'm talking to few people who shared their interest of starting a startup.<p>Whenever I talk to some young professional, the most common observation I have seen is - almost everyone wants to start a startup, literally almost everyone. But the fact is - they just don't know what it takes to make it work -- the insane hard work at initial stages. They just talk about success stories, but when it comes to put the time and build stuff, they disappear. And that's how I got inspired to share this thought on my blog.<p>I am not saying we should take that advice seriously and stop working on our dreams. That advice was more for those people who ""think"" they want to start a startup, but probably don't understand the reality to make it happen.<p>-Aditya (Adeologue.com)",1209370346

175456,comment,175256,175256,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"So, Mint is probably way undervalued and nearly all of the others are way (way way way! holy crap!) overvalued.  Billions for Habbo and Linden?  Seriously?  400mil for Slide?<p>But, I got a chuckle out of Ning's valuation, given that they raised roughly the same amount about a week ago...so they literally have as much cash on hand as Alley Insider has valued them at.  So, the business is worthless in their eyes.  Interesting.  (I think the valuation of Ning during that round of financing was wildly out of whack, but it's certainly worth something.)",1209369998

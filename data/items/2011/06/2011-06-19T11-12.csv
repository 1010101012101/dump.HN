2670715,comment,2670067,2670067,3,0,AlexeyMK,,,"TL;DR - agreed, I expect the government will eventually force Facebook to open up and support a common federated social networking standard.<p>As spullara explains below, Facebook's monopoly has come because Facebook Connect is an all-round better product.  Publishers get access to easy syndication (""oh, you just joined XYZ? Here are some badges; want to share them on Facebook and let your friends know about us?"") as well as higher-quality users overall (Facebook accounts tend to be real).  Users get a single login from a service they (mostly) trust and easy integration with their social network (""oh, John's using turntable.fm too? Sweet!"").<p>The brilliance of Facebook Connect is the tie-in of syndication with identity.  Logging in with Facebook is a better experience than just registering, for all parties involved.  This is why Facebook Connect works and why MSN Passport failed a decade ago.<p>The monopoly side of things is going to become a problem in the coming years; I for one expect federal intervention in the form of mandating a common federated social networking platform (a la, but not necessarily, via the protocols developed by diaspora).  Federation and decentralization is what happened with phones and with email; if Facebook/social networking-style communication is the next generation, it seems like a reasonable next step.<p>Most users will never tell the difference, at first - Facebook will remain their default client both for login and for reading friends' profiles and news feed.  With time, however, competitors will begin to emerge and offer alternate interfaces for either news feed filtration or for identity, opening up space for innovation in a place once dominated by one or more entrenched players (Firefox vs IE, Gmail vs Hotmail/Yahoo/AOL).  Early adopters will be using social networking tools but will be able to seamlessly interoperate with people still on Facebook.<p>Perhaps I'm naively optimistic, but I'd be excited for a future like that.  For now, though, I'll stick to Facebook Connect - the bigger it gets, the more likely regulation will occur.",1308484765

2670710,comment,2669035,2669035,2,0,jmitcheson,,,"Chris Anderson (Wired editor) in his book ""Free"" had one strategy - to never write any feedback down on paper. By never writing it down, you only remember the things that get repeated by your customers frequently, and you just forget everything else.<p>It's kind of like a high pass filter for feedback, with a very cheap implementation cost ;)<p>Obviously this tip won't suit everyone all of the time so don't flame me. I thought it was an interesting idea though. It's a really good book, btw; some good advice and stories if you are building freemium web apps.",1308484054

I'm very aware of the downsides of managing separate accounts and logins but I refuse to host my whole identity with one company.

2670705,comment,2670078,2670078,2,0,autalpha,,,"True story that happened to me: while trying to look up information for a restaurant reservation, I found some security issue that would redirect user to an obscure host name. I think it was an issue of bad DNS setup with their web hosting provider.  In any case, being the helpful and detail-oriented web guy, I sent their head quarter's team an email with the detail of what's wrong and a solution that should fix it. I got an email from them the next morning, and since I started my email with ""While I was looking up information for a reservation..."" the person arranged the reservation for me.  So I thought that was that.  But after the meal was done, the owner came out and thanked me personally and took care of all our drinks.  And since it was a Brewery/restaurant, the beer tasted a bit sweeter :)<p>I've also sent another email to a small online belt buckle shop to notify them of the insecure way they were setting up Paypal on their site (again, the steps to reproduce the problem and steps to fix it).  The owner emailed me back to thanked me as well as taking care of the order personally.  You know, most people are just happy that you are giving them some help.  Being in the hacking community, I would imagine that everyone is the same here--most of us are (overly) helpful individuals.  It's in our genes. So don't fight it and do the nice thing of sending them the steps to reproduce the problem and ways you can fix it.  If you feel that you should protect your anonymity, do it.  But do notify them :)<p>If one of these days, when I make an obvious security problem, I would hope, that one of us here would shoot me an email so I can fix it immediately.  And I will promise to do the same.",1308483618

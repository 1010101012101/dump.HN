Even if you're a good policeman whose conduct is objectively awesome, when you see someone recording you, you have to wonder, ""Will this guy catch me on camera screwing up, even though the last hundred times I've done everything right?  Will the people who view this recording understand that I'm doing everything right if I do?  Why doesn't this guy trust me?""  And even if you're a good policeman, you know your buddy Bob, well...  he doesn't have as exemplary a record as you do, but you think that on balance he's a good guy.<p>And, I don't know if this is true of the police, but for the teachers at least, they have the unions, their representatives and advocates, spending a LOT of time saying, ""Testing is of the devil.""  They hear it day in and day out, from other teachers, from the unions, from a lot of politicians.<p>Those things matter.  They matter a lot.  If they didn't matter, teachers wouldn't be human.<p>And the fact is, there are downsides to all of those safeguards.  They aren't perfect.  Some of them may need to be reformed.  Some may need to be reformed a lot.<p>But that's all beside the point, which is that teachers have a huge incentive to hate NCLB outside of its merits or faults as a program.",1360709822

Just because you made these two things coincide for you does not mean that they have to.""<p>Assuming, of course, that the volume of homework is sufficiently low to actually leave time or mental energy for anything else.  I am not sure that is something that we can just <i>assume</i>, although I will admit that I did not really bother to find out how long my homework would have taken in middle school.  Really though, the punishment for not turning in homework is handed down <i>regardless of whether or not students spent their time on something with more educational value</i>, and that is what I think is wrong here.  <i>Doing your homework</i> is more important than learning; if doing homework coincides with learning, that's good, but there is no requirement of that or even any consideration of the possibility that the homework might have no educational value.<p>""If you don't need to go to class to learn then go take all the ACT's and SAT's you want and get yourself into college without them and stop whining. Otherwise go to school.""<p>Of course, colleges also demand to see your high school transcript, and top schools will reject students whose high school GPA does not meet a certain threshold, so what you seem to be portraying as a student's choice is not much of a choice at all.  High school grades can have consequences years later; when I was an undergrad, I went to MIT to ask about their graduate program, and they stopped answering my questions as soon as I mentioned what college I was attending.  I had top marks on the SAT and SAT II exams, but without a report card to back that up I was not accepted to a top tier university.  I am by no means alone in this; I met plenty of other people like myself in college, and this sort of story can be heard elsewhere.<p>It is not a matter of whining, it is a problem with the approach we take to education.  Students who ""play the game"" get ahead; learning the material is secondary and on its own it gets students nowhere (on the other handing, forgetting the material at the end of the academic year or gaining the minimal understanding needed to receive a high grade is not punished or discouraged).  Disobedience means closed doors, regardless of whether or not a student has mastered the curriculum they were supposed to be taught.  If this sounds like the rest of life, well, that is exactly the point of school right?

For example, problems currently classed as NP-hard take, in the general case, an amount of time that increases exponentially in the problem size, so past a certain threshold, take too much time even given all the computers on earth.<p>The problem you'd have to solve here is basically the subset sum problem: given a set of transfers in an out of a mixer (let's say you already know which addresses it uses, which is not easy since it can make new ones for free) which subsets of the transfers out have the same totals as which subsets of transfers coming in?  (From that point you identify one in/out set of addresses as belonging to the same person.)<p>That problem likewise takes exponential time to solve in the general case.  And since the mixer chooses the transfers, they can pick it so that it's hard to find solution partitions (i.e. drive it to the part of the problem space where heuristics help the least).<p>Or they could go the opposite approach and add a random, time varying tolerance (i.e. charge a fee that varies between x and y % over time, or promise that you might get up to x% more or y% less than you put in) that makes the problems extremely underdetermined so that there are arbitrarily many constraint-satisfying solutions thus that the aggregate data is uninformative.<p>No, ""Google solves complex problems"" does not prove what you think it does.",1360708574
5210058,comment,5205506,5209786,5,0,wisty,,,"The problem with a fixed M0 is that broad money (credit and debt based on the money) can fluctuate, causing deflation. Deflation makes people delay on investments, which causes a recession, and more deflation. It's a vicious cycle. That's basically how the Great Depression happened.<p>The GFC was a similar crisis, but the Fed was able to quantitatively ease the US out of it. OK, things were still pretty dire, but given how much debt there was (as a result of the debt bubble which had kept the economy going gangbusters for so long) it wasn't as bad as it could have been.<p>Austrians (Ron Paul) say things like ""that's bad - the Fed shouldn't be able to rescue the economy, because that will force the bankers to act like grown-ups"". Unfortunately, it doesn't work that way. The bankers will still take massive risks, and crash the economy every now and then, and the Fed won't be able to help.<p>Of course, there's reasons to be concerned about the US economy. IIRC, real median wages haven't grown much since the 80s. Basically all the growth has been the rich getting richer. But I don't think that's because of inflation, so much as general policies which favor GPD growth over raising median wages. The US is not a country which cares about the poor, and outsourcing has weakened poor Americans' bargaining power. With the rise of China, that might change (Chinese wages are rising quite quickly, which will make US workers more competitive, which will allow them to demand higher wages). Whatever the case, I don't think it's all the fault of inflationary monetary policy.<p>And no, I don't blame robots. If robots were taking all the jobs, they wouldn't be going to China. Maybe they will take all the jobs one day, but currently more robots means cheaper products, which means more jobs. Also, before anyone says ""the jobs will just go to Africa"", they better consider the challenges in building infrastructure there, the fact that Africa is quite diverse (there won't be 200 million peasants all swarming to special economic zones within a decade), and the added demand from all the newly wealthy (or at least, not piss-poor) Chinese.",1360708569

For example picking the color of a UI widget with a continuous slider vs entering the rgb value and reloading.

This seems go pretty clearly against Tesla. When your cell phone tells you ""charging complete"", do you expect the battery to be only 90% full? When your put gas in your car, and the needle is on F, do you expect the tank to be 90% full, or full to (rated) capacity?<p>As for not plugging it in overnight, well, it's not always going to be possible to plug in the vehicle overnight, especially if you're out on a road trip. Sure, it'd be optimal if every owner could plug in their Model S every night, but the world isn't optimal and the Model S has to be robust enough to go a night without being plugged in if it has a hope of being a practical vehicle rather than a $101,000 toy.<p><i>I also understand the author in that he was 'just pretending to be your average Joe' but given that this is a special car that needs to be handled with special care that comparison just doesn't hold up.</i><p>Except that's not what Tesla's marketing claims.

Freelancers go out of business all the time, and they also don't engage in professional practices with any great will. Larger plans -> larger teams -> more professional and more durable as a business. They also tend to evaluate software more carefully and then stick with what they pick because A) they don't get paid to try out infinite software packages, B) they do actually want to get paid and not procrastinate or diddle around pretending to look for the perfect tool, C) getting a whole team off one tool and onto another takes valuable time & energy away from actual work.<p>2.

I don't know if that's true or not, but that is a very high average speed and it will have serious effects on fuel economy.<p>To average 81 MPH in traffic, you are going to need to spend a fair amount of time north of 90 MPH.  If the charging station intervals were based on expected speeds closer to 55-65 MPH, then the idea that the trip could be made at 80+ was questionable from the outset.<p>So, yeah, there's adhering to posted speed limits for best fuel economy, there's driving with the traffic for maximum safety, and then there's full-blown Mad Max mode, which is apparently what you do when you want to make the car you're testing look bad.",1360706895

I'll try to touch all of the ways in which your situation is different and why this has a bearing on the subject at hand:<p>-You have fewer students.  This is a _much_ bigger deal than you make it out to be, especially at higher grade levels.  When you have to give feedback to close to 200 students (over 200 it not unheard of), you can't make it as meaningful as you'd like.  There are things you can do with a couple dozen students that simply does not scale.<p>-You are dealing with an easier subset of children.  If their parents want them to have extra lessons, and are both willing and able to pay for it (or even fill out scholarship forms), then you're not dealing with any of the difficult kids.  Parents who don't care about school beget kids who don't care, and they are orders of magnitude more difficult to work with.<p>-Its clear that you are not aware of how much material these standardized tests expect you to cover in a course.  I'm sure it varies by state, but this is from the perspective of VA testing, which is where I grew up and where I know many teachers.  For just about any tested middle or high school class, they have the material mapped to within 3 or 4 days of the length of the school year.  A couple of unexpected days off and they have to start cutting material that the test expects to be covered.  There's absolutely no time to do the things you're talking about unless you want to blow off the tests - and then you're out of a job.<p>Standardized testing, _in its current form_, is an unmitigated disaster for students' educations.  If you can say otherwise having actually faced the system you are so happy with (or even talked to a few who have), then we have a conversation.",1360706427

The ancient Greeks were quite religious, but were also quite advanced in some fields of philosophy and mathematics. They also (largely) moved war away from their mainland. They actively worked to remove the daily effort of living onto a working class, which consisted largely of non-Greek citizens. This freed up the Greeks (at least a large class of their citizens) to expend energy on what would previously have been considered trivialities or indulgences. See the Roman empire, war on the fringes made the core of the empire safer and advancement of various schools of thought much more feasible. The same story has played out in other locations at other times.<p>Move war and famine away from your core population.

(breathalysers are notorious for being incredibly broad in what the detect (bad false positive rate), and they are required to assume a 2100:1 ratio when estimating blood concentration from the measured breath concentration. In reality, there is a lot (up to +/-800 for some people). There <i>is</i> a good, science-based reason for that ratio involving the partial pressure of EtOH. The reason is valid, it simply ignores the (large) minority of cases where other factors complicate the analysis.<p>You may suggest that it would be easy to use modern techniques to find a better formula that accounts for these variations. That would work... but it has always been possible. You don&#x27;t need anything particularly fancy to add a few corrections. These problems - and how to correct them - have been known for <i>decades</i>, yet breathalysers haven&#x27;t changed. Why? Because an inaccurate tool gives police the leeway to target a much larger set of people (if they want to - selective enforcement is a powerful tool).<p>> Should we only opt for rigorous methods like drawing blood samples?<p>Yes, absolutely, and I (and <i>many</i> defence lawyers and civil right organizations) recommend insisting on a blood test should you ever asked to take a breathalyser because of how inaccurate and manipulatable the breath test is in real-world situations. (disclaimer: this can vary between states; see a local lawyer for proper advice)<p>> at the inevitable cost of some errors and inconvenience<p>A necessary feature of a free society is the assumption of innocence until proven guilty. Law enforcement is <i>deliberately</i> given a harder task, because errors are not simply an <i>inconvenience</i>. Errors risk charging an innocent person with a crime. You would not call being arrested because of a false-positive an <i>inconvenience</i>.<p>> You assume that this system will be used to justify police brutality and that this system will be used by people who think that any black person is a &quot;criminal&quot;.<p>I don&#x27;t need to <i>assume</i> anything. These things are already extremely common today without the need for advanced data processing techniques. If for some reason you doubt these facts, you may want to look up the per-capita incarceration rates by race and compare that to stuff like the drug use rates for the same groups.<p>> In my world I believe in just intentions<p><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Just-world_fallacy"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Just-world_fallacy</a><p>> I have a higher opinion of the people who join the police<p>I prefer to keep my opinions based in reality.<p>While I&#x27;m sure only a minority of police are abusive, the rest are aiding and abetting by not reporting the crimes committed other officers.

I am a domain expert (finance) but I do also have 4 years of CS so consider myself non-idiotic, if not haskell-genius, on programming languages. I adopted Python (before it was popular - it was behind ruby / PHP / perl at the time) because it was pragmatic above all. That last statement is being violated with 3.x, and that is the seed of my concern.<p>Before answering your questions 1 thru 3, some context. It is my strong belief that the authorities are constantly looking at golang and JS as their competitors, in other words, the web world, whereas the real hardcore advantage of Python is in science and numerical computing. As evidence, witness numerous Python books which advise new users to hit the Continuum Analytics or Enthought sites for their full-stack Python installations, even texts which are not about numerics.<p>On your questions:<p>1) I don&#x27;t care about threading. I care about pushing as many compute bits through the Xeon as I can in a given amount of seconds (using Numpy). But as I am a data scientist, I need the REPL. C is out. Why can I still not do this easily? Multiprocessing is there, sure, but it&#x27;s been unch for years, while Cuda, OpenCL etc are far too hard for guy like me whose intellectual bandwidth is occupied with the domain, not the CS. Isn&#x27;t that what Python was supposed to be about? Getting stuff done? Why isn&#x27;t Python vectoring my data through the CPU and GPU yet, 15 years after numeric was first introduced?<p>2) Continuum Analytics is doing an awesome job and I don&#x27;t see why they, or Enthought, couldn&#x27;t take up the mantle, 10gen/Datastax style to use a database analogy. They really know their customers, and the Continuum stack delivers <i>real</i> new value every 6 months, and not only for a scientific audience. More generally, real users in real domains should be driving the project.<p>3) I am less concerned about Python 3 happening as planned, than I am about the focus of the project. Type annotations? This is an intellectual indulgence if it does not increase performance. Asyncio? We&#x27;ve had async libraries for years! Even when I started Python we had async libraries (not as good but they were there). How is async something fantastic and new? It&#x27;s nothing but polishing an existing capability a little bit further. Unicode. fine. But again, web focused. Nobody else cares. Xrange laziness. Okay. Leaves me cold. Print(). No CS benefit, but huge marketing loss as you can&#x27;t go out to newbies anymore and say &quot;hey, check this out... Python hello world?&quot;<p><pre><code>  >>> print &quot;hello world&quot;\n  &quot;hello world&quot;\n</code></pre>\nIt just doesn&#x27;t get any simpler, and yet Python wants to throw out that unique hook for new people who care little about coding but a lot about domain. It&#x27;s zero, genuinely zero, boilerplate, whereas there are a dozen languages where you can do print(&quot;hello world&quot;). Seems trivial, but in print vs print() we have the key difference in philosophy (get-stuff-done-now vs take-me-oh-so-seriously). If you&#x27;re so serious at a computer science level, you&#x27;re not going to do Python.<p>So. What is Python. A serious language? NO. A wonderfully malleable, not too serious, friendly language, into which you can insert some real hardcore stuff (Numpy, ML, website parsing, database transformations, game scripting, image processing....the list is endless) really easily? Yes.<p>Where is Python <i>genuinely</i> way ahead of everyone else? Only on numerical computing.<p>It strikes me that Guido and co are embarrassed by their weekend hack of 1.x and 2.x, when that is precisely what the user base loves about it. Their attempt to make Python serious, is killing Python&#x27;s original spirit. There is nothing wrong with 2.7. Nobody wants Python to morph into Java.<p>So, am I a Luddite wanting 2.7 to live forever? no. What I want is vectorization plus DAG-like workflows. These are the most important pieces of computer science that actually dovetail with real world use cases, today. Yes async is cool, but golang now owns that space. What I&#x27;d really like is for Python to give us a good framework for the Big Data world which is in almost everybody&#x27;s use case now, and that means, Python needs to talk multiprocessor, Python needs to talk GPU, Python needs to talk cluster, and Python should long ago have been addressing this directly. Python needs to &quot;go vectorized&quot;. That should be the project&#x27;s obsession. SIMD, in a word, where the parallel granularity can go from GPU kernels,to CPU, to multi-machine clusters, and DAG-like workflows (with possible recursion) built in. This is not a nice-to-have capability anymore. It is what the next wildly popular mainstream programming language will have, built into the language. The signals from everything we&#x27;re seeing added to 3.x is NOT this. It&#x27;s web-like stuff. That battle is over. JS won.<p>Let&#x27;s not gift the opportunity of huge data to Java (Spark) and Cuda, or a new language that will see the future better than us. It should be Python!<p>There you go.

Cows are not.<p>I&#x27;m also in favor of a single system that solves a bunch of problems than a hodgepodge nightmare. That was the vision behind NLS, the Mother of All Demos, SmallTalk, Plan9 etc. And Doug Engelbart can be found favoring the easy to master but complex at first glance approach <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeSgaJt27PM"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeSgaJt27PM</a> instead of the easy to get started approach of Mac GUIs that won out. The problem arises when the system makes too many weird decisions and people fork it to make their own all encompassing systems. Then it takes forever for crippled versions of these system to be adopted. It doesn&#x27;t help when even the niche audience is divided. Things that can be disagreed on should be minimized.<p>So there is no technical need to throw the complex at first glance syntax at new users these days. You could convert it to a more verbose syntax and back again.<p>Terse syntax looks clean and easy to scan when you use it daily. But what if you don&#x27;t? Then it&#x27;s not self documenting, you have to look up commands to read code. If I don&#x27;t use command line for a few months, I remember the basics like mkdir, ls, cd but I forget the nuances like ls -a and the billion other options. So it becomes a chore of looking things up constantly. Could be fixed with natural language autocomplete for writing code, but not reading. If you considered such use cases, you wouldn&#x27;t be so sure about the terse syntax.<p>So many made up words are also asking too much. They&#x27;ll certainly be worth learning if the system is proven. Haskell has it&#x27;s own way of doing things, does a lot of things well, but seems to make many things difficult in practice. So it remains a niche that very few learn beyond the surface curiosities.

10280465,comment,10271149,10279452,0,0,pron,,,"> In those cases, one possible strategy is to take a detour via auxiliary data types...<p>If you&#x27;re interested in formal proofs, I suggest you read the discussion <i>Should Your Specification Language Be Typed?</i>[1] by Leslie Lamport (Paxos, TLA+) and Lawrence Paulson (ML, Isabelle). It is very balanced and discusses the relative pros and cons of typed and untyped proofs for formal verification (the closest they come to making a specific recommendation is exploring pluggable optional types).<p>> If the computer can&#x27;t do it perfectly, I&#x27;ll do it myself. I have no taste for automated mistakes...<p>You&#x27;re talking about false positives, while a better approach might be to allow false negatives (as Idris does), i.e. a program doesn&#x27;t typecheck without additional proof.<p>Alternatively, if you want the computer to do its work automatically, why stop at a simple type-checker that runs for a few seconds? Why not let the computer run a model checker for a few hours and verify some much more interesting properties? It doesn&#x27;t deductively <i>prove</i> correctness, but it certainly increases confidence much more than testing, and it&#x27;s orders-of-magnitude easier to use than any proof assistant (the authors of the seL4 kernel spent 30 man years proving 7500LOC with a theorem prover!); it&#x27;s probably as easy or easier than coming up with your auxillary types.<p>> What part is hard to accept?<p>That equational reasoning is always more convenient for people than state simulation.<p>> Exactly the ones I happen to need to write correct programs - and prove them so.<p>I do that in Java. Haskell only brings you marginally closer to the correctness of a sorting algorithm than Java does (if at all) anyway. If I need more formal verification, I use a model checker (JPF in the past, now I&#x27;m about to switch to TLA+). It feels more natural for me than using types for proofs. I&#x27;ve found that using a model-checker that works directly on the Java code (like JPF) is not an advantage in terms of total effort over one that uses a separate specification language, especially one that&#x27;s as (relatively) simple as TLA+/+Cal. I haven&#x27;t tried KeY, though (also works on Java code, but uses symbolic execution; gained some publicity recently when it found a bug in a complex sorting algorithm -- in fact, possibly the world&#x27;s most used sorting algorithm).<p>> but I&#x27;m really happy that I don&#x27;t need to care about tuning the behavior of a managed language&#x27;s runtime system... If performance ever becomes that much of a problem, I&#x27;ll just call Rust or C++.<p>That&#x27;s more myth than reality. HotSpot without any tuning whatsoever performs better than pretty much all managed languages. Tuning is required if you need to really come close to C-speeds, and in those cases it still requires far less work than C. But that&#x27;s a whole other discussion.<p>> I find my productivity when using Java even lower than when using C++<p>I can believe that, but I was a C++ programmer for a decade before switching (primarily) to Java -- at first quite reluctantly -- and my productivity soared. However, I wasn&#x27;t talking about anecdotes or personal experience. It is a proven fact that the productivity of the industry at large jumped considerably (estimates are 2x-3x on average) when it switched from C++ to Java.<p>> But «equivalent in raw power» doesn&#x27;t imply «equally convenient to use».<p>Exactly.<p>> Models of computation based on term rewriting happen to be easy to reason about in a compartmentalized, divide-and-conquer manner than Turing machines.<p>True, but no one programs Turing machines. Whether term-rewriting is more convenient than mainstream imperative or imperative-functional (i.e. Clojure, ML, Erlang) requires empirical evidence which is so far sorely lacking.<p>> Most algorithms that interest me are data transformations - some sequential, some parallel, but almost never concurrent.<p>Ah, that explains it. I mostly do concurrent/distributed algorithms (I build concurrent, distributed in-memory databases).<p>> I highly doubt that the tools you mention have anything useful to offer, although I would love to be wrong here.<p>So you&#x27;ll be happy to learn that you are wrong! TLA+ and friends have been used to verify lots and lots of concurrent and distributed algorithms (as well as hardware cache-coherence protocols) like Paxos, Raft,(fixed) Chord, and many, many others.

Then, when you resume sessions from the same machine, you can prove that you have the private part and the server can accept your existing cookies. With this approach, cookies are no longer bearer tokens and stealing cookies becomes worthless.<p>This can be hardened even against local malware running as the same principal as the user doing the browsing if the browser&#x27;s ChannelID implementation generates and stores the private key inside a TPM or HSM.",1443211636

Of course there are various tactics to try and combat this; for example there is a wiki page dedicated to innocuous-looking code that leads to intermittent tests [1].<p>The human reasons centre around the difficulty of getting people to care about spending time fixing a test that fails one time in 1,000 (which is still very noticeable when you are running it hundreds of times a day). Unless the issue is something that fits a known pattern it&#x27;s hard work, difficult to tell if your fix even worked, and not likely to be considered a top priority due to the diffuse, hard to quantify, nature of the benefits.<p>I think the fact that both Google and Mozilla still have significant problems with intermittents despite talented engineering staff and it having been a known problem for years implies that some of the standard thinking about making tests fully deterministic simply doesn&#x27;t apply; for this kind of work you have to embrace — or at least accept — the randomness, and look for ways to get the data you need despite the noise.<p>[1] <a href=""https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/QA/Avoiding_intermittent_oranges"" rel=""nofollow"">https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/QA/Avoiding...</a>",1443211587

As a Scottish fiddler (and composer) and AI enthusiast, this is an intensely interesting project to me. And it's certainly an insane idea with a tiny market and no way to monetize. And that's how it will remain. Scottish fiddling will always be an obscure niche, even within that community there will never be much demand for new music (and there's so many buried gems from the 18th century that this will virtually never change), and any existing demand can be easily fulfilled by the scores of people--including myself--who compose fiddle music the old-fashioned way.<p>Unlike Altair BASIC, this isn't a case of somebody creating a product in a growing industry people don't realize they need yet.

5088593,comment,5088260,5088260,32,0,kami8845,,,"I picked a new machine for my job a couple of days ago, so this is still fresh on my mind. Keep in mind that this is from the perspective of the UK (US is generally MUCH cheaper, oftentimes machines cost 50% of what they do here).<p>---------------<p>First, my criteria for the new machine are:<p>- Portable, screen size between 12"" - 14"", preferably as thin & light as possible<p>- SSD (No weird HDD/SDD hybrids)<p>- Reasonable resolution. 1080p here is overkill, 1366x768 leaves something to be desired<p>- No graphics card, I don't have a use for it, excess power usage & heat, another part that takes up space, adds weight, can break and needs driver support<p>- No optical drive (same reasons)<p>- Battery life 5+ hours<p>- Reliable brand. Good ones are Apple, ASUS, Samsung, Toshiba, Lenovo. Sony maybe but only with expensive models. Acer & HP are immediately disqualified. I really like Dell for some stuff (monitors, towers) but they seem to have a bad reputation for making reliable laptops.<p>- Good value for money. I really dislike over-spending even if it's not my own money<p>- Good Linux support<p>- Solid build quality<p>I don't care that much about performance. Sandy/Ivy Bridge is generally fine for me, and for the stuff that I care about (mainly reading/writing text) raw CPU power doesn't matter that much.<p>This filters things down quite a bit and brings us to the following models:<p>- Macbook Air 2011 (including this as it's a very similar machine to the 2012 but with apparently better Linux support)<p>- Macbook Air 2012<p>- ASUS Zenbook<p>- ASUS Zenbook Prime<p>- Lenovo X1 Carbon<p>- Samsung Series 9 900X3D<p>- Samsung Series 9 900X3C<p>- Lenovo X220<p>- Lenovo X230<p>Another requirement is dual external monitor support. Doing this on a laptop and under Linux turned out to be quite the tricky problem and the issue that probably consumed most of my time spent. For laptops with only 1 display out, there are 2 ways of working around this:<p>1. USB to HDMI adapter. Basically an external graphics card. This requires USB 3.0 for bandwidth reasons (USB 2.0 gives 35 MB/s. 1080p @ 32bpp is 8 MB / frame, meaning single-digit FPS rates at most) which disqualifies the MBA 2011 since it only has USB 2.0. Even with USB 3.0 from most of what I could find, these things are not really supported under Linux and probably best to avoid.<p>2. Matrox DualHead2Go. This is a cool invention that pretends it's a 3840x1080 display to the OS and then splits the signal digitally into 2. Costs about 120 GBP, but with not letting the OS know that it's actually 2 displays, also comes the OS not knowing that it's actually 2 displays: Fullscreen doesn't work properly for a lot of applications. And even though this could be made better through some window manager trickery, that feels like hacks, piled on top of more hacks. I also don't want to carry around this box just to drive 2 external monitors.<p>So, that means all laptops with only 1 display-out are out! (The X1 Carbon actually has a USB 3.0 Port thing with 2 DVI outputs but it seems to depend heavily on drivers (they only support Windows and are ""working on"" Mac support) so I've excluded it) Leaving us with:<p>- ASUS Zenbook<p>- ASUS Zenbook Prime<p>- Samsung Series 9 900X3D<p>- Samsung Series 9 900X3C<p>- Lenovo X220<p>- Lenovo X230<p>I used the Zenbook Prime and Samsung 900X3D in-store and initially liked the Zenbook Prime keyboard more than the Samsung. However more research reveals that ASUS seems to have big quality control issues with these (endless stories about shipping and re-shipping faulty units). This seems to be an especially big problem with the touchpads & SSDs of the original Zenbook. Also in the UK, they only carry one almost maxed-out Zenbook Prime configuration with SSD, which costs about 1500 GBP (linked above). A more sensible (albeit still expensive) configuration is also available, however only from Germany. Going through the order flow, the delivery time from Germany is listed as 3-18 days. Ordering an item like this where lots of people have complained about quality issues from another country seems to be asking for trouble. In addition to that, support under Linux seems to be non-straightforward <a href=""https://help.ubuntu.com/community/AsusZenbookPrime"" rel=""nofollow"">https://help.ubuntu.com/community/AsusZenbookPrime</a>, and I'm not thrilled about 1080p on a 13"" screen.<p>The Samsung Series 9 looked great from everything I could see. It's super light and yet solid. However since it is so thin the keys lacked notably in pitch. It's uncomfortable to type on (and I went multiple times over multiple days). In comparison I enjoyed typing on the Macbook Air much more even though it's similarly thin. The keyboard seems like an afterthought on the laptop. Since typing is really what I care about the most and I've gone through the pains of having a laptop with a keyboard I don't enjoy typing on with the model I'm currently writing this email on, this also seems like a sub-par choice.<p>So the Lenovo X220 / X230 is the last laptop standing! There are 2 choices here (or really 4 with the tablet versions), they are all pretty much twice as thick as any other model, though similar in terms of weight (others 1.1-1.5kg, X220 / X230 1.3-1.7kg depending on configuration). I think the X220 is the better choice here even though technically ""discontinued"". They're both standard voltage CPUs (compared to some of the ULV CPUs on other units) so performance is easily enough for my needs. In addition to that the X220 seems to be the laptop of choice for Ubuntu kernel developers <a href=""http://www.hnsearch.com/search#request/all&q=x220+uds"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.hnsearch.com/search#request/all&q=x220+uds</a> , while I've read about a lot of people having problems with the X230 and the Linux 3.2 kernel (Ubuntu 12.04 and Debian Wheezy). Also with the X230 they've switched from their traditional ThinkPad keyboard design to a chiclet-style keyboard for reasons that are not ultimately known to me, though probably some combination of standardisation (every other major vendor has been using them for years), cost-reduction, ability to add back-light, size reduction and other factors. In terms of typing experience there isn't a lot of data online, with some people saying it's ""good"" on both and others decrying the typing experience on the X230. I think the X220 is slightly preferable, especially considering how much cheaper it is now. The standard X220 goes for 600 GBP and 825 GBP for the tablet version while the X230 goes for 1100 GBP and the tablet version for 1700 GBP. All of these with HDD and thus requiring adding about 200 GBP extra for a SSD. So it seems that the X220 wins in almost all regards. The X230 does have slightly less weight (I think about 100-200g), and faster CPU/GPU performance but those factors are negligible to me. I think I like the tablet version on the X220 more as comes with an IPS screen and I can see myself use the laptop in ""tablet mode"" a lot.<p>--------------<p>In the end I picked the X220 and ordered it off ebay (new). The gist seems to be that unless you want to run a bleeding-edge Linux kernel I would recommend staying away from new (3rd gen Ivy Bridge e.g. i5-3xxx) laptops such as the ASUS Zenbook Prime / Lenovo X230 / Macbook Air 2012 as there's frequently issues w/ them.",1358721879

I feel ashamed I have been ignorant for so long.<p>In summary of what I've learned, it's generally accepted that there are around 200,000 people kept in active concentration camps [1].  There are two types of camps: those for political prisoners (and those related to suspected defectors, because you're guilty by association with the convicted individual) held until they die, and re-education camps for ""minor"" offenses. Regardless of the prisoner classification, both are subject to a similarly deplorable fate.<p>Conditions are eerily reminiscent of concentration camps operated by Nazi Germany and Imperial Japan.<p>This includes: 
1) Constant threat of public execution at the whims of guards. 2) Deplorable conditions including: lack of suitable sleeping areas, lack of general access to toilets except on a twice daily basis. 
3) Malnutrition. Amnesty reports 40% of inmates die due to malnutrition. Highly rationed diet consisting of 100 grams of corn (if you're not being punished) and salt soup. Finding and eating rats raw is generally considered a blessing, but at the risk of punishment by guards.
4) Torturing prisoners is commonplace. Without going into the gory details, suffice it to say, it is horrible. 
5) Human experimentation performed on prisoners a la Dr. Mengele. 
6) Infanticide of babies born in captivity.<p>I remember when I first learned about the Holocaust in school and wondered how in the hell did the world stand by for so long while these atrocities were being committed? Now I understand.<p>When you are, by pure randomness, lucky enough to be living in a part of the world where these horrible acts are distant enough to barely register on the press radar, reading about these things do seem unfathomable, almost fake.<p>Most of what I've heard about North Korea in the past has focused on their bizarre cult of personality and generally bizarre culture. As comical as North Korea is made out to be in much of the internet, there is a serious humanitarian crisis ongoing. Given that the Korean War ended in 1953, the situation has perpetuated for sixty years now.<p>If the statistic of six million Jews murdered during the Holocaust shocks and disgusts you, I shudder to think about what we shall uncover after the North Korean dictatorship falls (if it ever does at this point if the situation continues) and their dark history finally becomes public knowledge. It really makes me feel nauseous to think that we always have to wait until after the atrocities end to learn from them.<p>Is there anything we can do? I'm sure there is, I just don't know what. Ugh.<p>[1] Amnesty International Media Briefing on North Korean Prison Camps <a href=""http://www.amnesty.org/en/library/asset/ASA24/001/2011/en/2671e54f-1cd1-46c1-96f1-6a463efa6f65/asa240012011en.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amnesty.org/en/library/asset/ASA24/001/2011/en/26...</a>",1358721694

Upside:  Pretty much the lightest full-power 13.3"" laptop, 1600x900 screen, a comfortable keyboard, $880.  Downside:  None?  The screen is only pretty good, instead of being a high end, high color gamut screen?  It lacks a Thinkpad keyboard.  It has HDMI instead of DisplayPort.  This is a good general purpose laptop.<p>The Lenovo T430s: The downsides relative to the 13"" Vaio S is that it has a worse quality screen, it's slightly bigger at the same resolution, and has worse GPU, as if that even works on Ubuntu.  The upside is that it has a Thinkpad keyboard and the DVD player can be replaced with a hard drive bay or battery, and it has a mini-DisplayPort port.<p>The 15"" Vaio S:  The lightest 15"" laptop option in your price range, at 4.45 lbs.  You can get a quad core processor (without VT-d support, though, and I'm not sure about staying under $1000), and it has a 1920x1080 IPS screen (with orange tint problems).<p>I'm told the Vaio S's work fine with Ubuntu.  However, you should carefully check forums online to make sure of their hardware support.<p>If you want to consider ultrabooks, the X1 Carbon is worth checking out, but a version with 8 GB of RAM is expensive with marginal benefit compared to, say, the 13"" Vaio S, or the ASUS UX31A for that matter.<p>I'm a fan of Thinkpad keyboards but if I had to own only one computer, it would be the 13"" Vaio S, because of the GPU and better screen, and (to my subjective opinion) better size.  If you don't care about GPU at all, and if you don't care about screen color or viewing angles that much, a T430s is a good bet.

The reason, as far as I am concerned, is simple:  expanding access to knowledge and to education is crucial for maintaining a just legal system in any democratic society.  The better educated the general public is, the better able they are to keep politicians in check, to fix problems like overreaching prosecutors, to reform laws that make no sense, and to ensure that minor crimes do not bring overly harsh punishments.<p>We cannot claim that everyone has equal access to education if academic publications are prohibitively expensive.  At one time, that was a situation that simply could not be changed, because the publishing industry was the best way to disseminate knowledge and we were better off monetizing that system.  In the 1970s, that changed when global computer networks that could connect low-cost personal computers became a reality; today, we can rapidly disseminate textbooks, scientific journals, course notes, and recordings of lectures and discussions at low cost.  Even the poorest schools and libraries in America have computers with Internet access, and could theoretically gain access to what would be the largest library in human history if we took the time to build it.  It is just one piece of the puzzle, of course, but it is an important piece.<p>The only thing holding us back now is, ironically, copyright law -- the very legal system that was originally meant to ensure that knowledge could be spread far and wide has transformed into a system that cripples our ability to spread our knowledge.  Instead of the Internet becoming home to the world's most expansive library, it has become a system for further restricting access to information.  Instead of being able to read whatever published research we want, we are forced to navigate a maze of paywalls.  Textbook publishers are now using their copyrights and the Internet to kill the used book market, and are experimenting with ways to create books that students can only read for a limited time before they must pay again.<p>If JSTOR does indeed provide a necessary service, if they are not just leeches taking advantageous of our anachronistic approach to academic publishing, let them prove it:  end the copyrights on academic publications, and let JSTOR show us how important their search service truly is <i>by charging for access to it</i>.  I have my doubts that a peer-to-peer search service would not be equally useful and much cheaper, but right now there is no way to test that theory.  If you can name something important that academic publishers and companies like JSTOR do with the money they bring in that could not be done equally well or better using today's technology, please do so (note that, at least in the case of scientific articles, the writing, formatting, reviewing, and often even editing are not paid for by the publisher, and so you should not bother naming any of the above).<p>So if you want to fix a problem that affects everyone, perhaps you should be thinking about <i>that</i> problem.",1358721122

The hardest to deal with is always going to be #3 because everyone always is trying to get you to use their whole architecture, even thought most of the time they suck at some or all of what they sell.<p>I think that #3 will also get a lot better with commercial software. The reality is that most of these guys have spent the last 5-10 years buying up competitors who built other systems their customers were interested in as an attempt to get all that business under one contract. Their efforts integrating software from acquisitions has been pathetic, at least in part because they haven't had a services-oriented architecture even though that's what really is called for. So I think this is a major area where we'll see changes in the next 5-10 years.<p>That being said, I think pretty much all off-the-shelf systems suck, but you're better off being able to hold someone else responsible for dev and sustainably meeting requirements and use in-house talent to hack around and problem solve so that users end up getting what they need fast.<p>You also want to chuck systems every few years and get something a lot better without having to pay the upfront costs of a rewrite like you would with a BYO-SIS.<p>And while I think this goes without saying, though these days I've seen districts screw this up, no matter how hosting is taken care of you need to own that data.

That means the Internet is about to get less free very soon there, once their governments put the UN proposals into law. And part of those proposals was the ""sender pays"" thing. Now let's just hope the countries who rejected it this time around won't use these countries as a role model next time.<p>It's very likely Orange was one of the European ISP's lobbying for sender pays at ITU, as well. I don't know why Google would offer to pay them, considering Africa is going to be dominated by Android either way. Nokia's Lumias or RIM's phones are nowhere near the $50 mark Android phones have reached there, and they are going to dominate just like in India and China, where they've also almost killed Nokia and RIM from their leading positions in the past.

You want to fill up a water bottle as quickly as you can? What about emptying it as fast as possible? The second one may be easier to solve, and gives you additional insight into the problem you want to solve.<p>Avoidance: This is more general, but don't look up what you want to find on the internet. Look for something more specific, or don't look it up at all. I forget exactly what it was, but one time I wanted to find something easily online, but I didn't want to get the answer right away (waiting to get an answer invests more of your neurons to the answer). I searched for the harder things first. Also, looking things up will show you the way that other people solved the problem, not the way that you solved the problem. It taints the waters when you look online for something you're trying to be creative about.<p>Compound Interest: The pathways you make between ideas today will be useful tomorrow. The training exercises you subject your brain to today will pay off tomorrow. I like to imagine a river whenever I think about the 'flow' of ideas in my brain. The river is always flowing, but some days it moves more of the bottom of the river. Sometimes, you'll uncover something cool, sometimes not. Rediscovering the bottom constrains you to similar thoughts, just going a little bit deeper. You likely won't get new ideas from the bottom of the river. You need your flow to branch out, to expand and see where it goes. Use some of your brain flow to bifuricate your brain flow and find something new. Maybe it will bring you back to your main river, or maybe you'll find something new.<p>Tipping Points: When thinking of something new, blowing the problem up to infinity, or extremely large (or maximum), or extremely small (or minumum) can put an instant perspective on what needs to happen and whether or not a solution is even possible.<p>Lollapaloozas: The creative slide. I call this mental momentum - when you start having good ideas, you continue having them (until you run out of steam). They may not truly be good, but the more ideas you have in a set amount of time, the more power they having in breaking down the barriers that are preventing your thoughts from going further.",1358719856

Things have greatly changed since then, particularly when it comes to the dissemination of human knowledge.  In today's world, a book can be published at no cost over the Internet.  Scholarly articles, course notes, recordings of course lectures, and all the other methods of communicating knowledge can all be done rapidly, cheaply, and on a global scale using the Internet.<p>""it does not mean that the resulting work ought to belong to the public""<p>As Thomas Jefferson put it, ""The field of knowledge is the common property of mankind.""  The idea that a person's knowledge should be hidden behind paywalls, or that it should collect dust on the bookshelves of a university library, should be considered <i>disgusting</i> in today's world.  Copyright only ever made sense when it came to academic publishing <i>as a way to promote the publishing industry</i>, because at one time the publishing industry was the most effective system for spreading knowledge (ironically, copyright started in England out of an attempt to censor the publishing industry).  The moment we created a better system -- the Internet -- we should have reevaluated the application of copyright to academic publishing, and rewrote the law to promote the use of the Internet over the publishing industry.<p>Instead, what we have today is a bizarre situation:  the publishing industry has more power than ever before under copyright law, and the Internet is being used to further restrict access to knowledge.  Publishers are using copyrights and abusing the Internet as a way to attack the used book market, and even to avoid actually publishing journals (why do we even bother with the publishing industry if they do not actually publish things?).  The moral issue here is not whether or not human knowledge should be shared online, but whether or not the academic publishing industry should even be a player anymore.<p>""crimes against JSTOR and MIT""<p>That the word ""crime"" is even mentioned in the context of what Aaron did is a sign that our legal system has become completely disconnected from serving the interests of society.  The law apparently considers the protection of the revenue stream of an anachronistic publishing industry to be of greater value than improving access to knowledge.  I suppose you might say that people should just pay up or travel to the nearest university library -- and if they cannot afford to pay and cannot afford the travel costs, too bad (after all, if they wanted to be educated, why are they so poor?).<p>Aaron was doing his civic duty by breaking bad laws; more people should follow his example.",1358719260

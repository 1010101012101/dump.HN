They showed that al-Qaida leader Osama bin Laden obtained copies of some of the documents WikiLeaks published before bin Laden was killed by U.S. Navy Seals in 2011.<p>This is a terrifying precedent and opens the door to charge <i>any</i> whistleblower with &quot;adhering to [the United States&#x27;s] Enemies, giving them Aid and Comfort,&quot; and thus treason.

In practice it&#x27;s more like a sort of hybrid, in that even though it&#x27;s garbage collected you have a lot of opportunities to write code that still doesn&#x27;t really use it, without having to &quot;drop down to&quot; C or something.

When I network with people face-to-face, I always get a sense of how they may want to work with me in the future. E.g. Maybe they&#x27;re a designer; I&#x27;m a programmer; we could collaborate on X kind of project.<p>LinkedIn&#x27;s placeholder text makes connections seem generic and less useful.

If the other person, the person who receives the call, puts down the receiver, it doesnt hang up the call, meaning that when I went to find my bank card, the fraudster was still on the other end, waiting for me to pick up the phone and call the bank. As I did this, he first played a dial tone down the line, and then a ring tone, making me think it was a normal call. He will have been sitting next to the first person that called me, no doubt laughing their heads off at how stupid Id been.&quot;<p>Wow, what? This seems pretty crazy.

6125297,comment,6121732,6124282,3,0,jerf,,,"&quot;Why do you say the OSI model is unrealistic?&quot;<p>The layers do not reflect reality. The higher up you go, the less obvious the mapping to the things that really exist gets, and the mapping is getting fuzzier over time (or, phrased another way, the OSI model is not only unrealistic, but <i>increasingly</i> unrealistic).<p>This is as opposed to possible meanings of the phrase, like &quot;impractical&quot;. It is probably theoretically possible to write something that really would have seven clear layers, though I have to hedge; a lot of really high-performance stuff is even <i>fuzzier</i> than the consumer stuff. The recent trend towards userland-level networking at the highest performance end pretty much collapses layer 3 and above into one application. But it would at least ship bytes from here to there, it&#x27;s certainly not an impossible design. It just isn&#x27;t the real one. (And I&#x27;d have grave concerns about its performance at the top end.)<p>I have to admit this is another trend in programming that I just Do Not Get. This bizarre insistence on taking some inappropriate model, then with malice aforethought deliberately squinting at things that manifestly do not fit into the model until your vision is so fuzzy that they do seem to fit together, then yelling at anyone who dares point out you&#x27;ve damn near closed your eyes and probably aren&#x27;t seeing clearly. See also every web framework&#x27;s desperate need to insist that they are MVC, even as the lines that must be drawn between the various components to show where the M, V, and C are wildly and drunkenly veer hither and yon in a terrifically convoluted manner, criss-crossing dozens of components, instead of simply explaining <i>what they actually are</i>. I just don&#x27;t get it. Models aren&#x27;t blueprints, <i>let alone</i> the very definition of virtue. If they don&#x27;t work, <i>dispose of them</i>.",1375156049

Humans are probably not actually processing anywhere near 1.25 mbps of input, and as far as our actual experience, we&#x27;re discarding the vast majority of the information we even take in.<p>Consider, for example, that if you could perfectly predict the exact path of a person&#x27;s fovea as they watched an SD movie, you could aggressively compress everything more than a dozen pixels away from that. A few pixels further, and you wouldn&#x27;t even need to store chroma information at all. Let&#x27;s say you can do that at 100 kbps, and the pixels on the fovea are 1 mbps. That would put your total bitrate at about 105kbps for video. If you don&#x27;t optimize audio at all, that brings the cost down to about $170B/year.<p>And that&#x27;s not even with new psychophysics; it&#x27;s just better input. Sure, playing it back would be hard, but <i>in principle</i>, you could fool a brain into thinking it was experiencing the data firsthand. I think it&#x27;s reasonable to think this is still a <i>massive</i> upper bound. It&#x27;s not unreasonable to think that a lifetime of human sensory experience could be encoded on the order of hundreds of gigabytes, if not less.",1375154787

Yes, releasing this information would be harmful to both the company and the customers.  But the principle is: &quot;there is no safety net&quot;.  And in the long run it will incentivize building higher quality products.<p>e.g. When I golf, I refuse to take mulligans because it keeps me in a state of mind of, &quot;this is my only chance&quot;.

You need to consider not just whether something occurs, but how much impact it has.<p>I don&#x27;t care whether a bank earns a financial gain or a loss. I care how big the gain or loss is. One hundred years of small profits can be wiped out in one bad quarter.<p>I do not believe Taleb is proposing punishing all risk taking. He&#x27;s advocated aggressively taking risks where the downside is known.<p>The problem we face is that many are now in a position to get a limited, positive upside if things go well, but they face no downside. And the potential harm in such situations has no upper bound.<p>Skin in the game ought to be proportional to harm. Many comments mention medicine as a profession that should not have skin in the game.<p>Rubbish. Doctors are very liable if things go wrong. But it depends how wrong.

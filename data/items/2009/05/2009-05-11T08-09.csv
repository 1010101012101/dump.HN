I use Linux on my desk at work because all I need there are terminals and a browser. I bought a MacBook because I need to use Photoshop and Reason on the go whilst still having a posix base (and it was a great deal, too). On my deskat home I have a souped-up PC running Windows 7 and a beefy FreeBSD server, so I can do all of the above. All platforms annoy me regularly, sadly.",1242032267

603197,comment,602307,603167,0,0,silentOpen,,,"It's not the language that is important, it's the programming style(s) the language supports. With Scheme and Java, you get a functional language (and one in which other paradigms can easily be implemented) and an OO-ish language. Pedagogically, I think that's superior to a sorta-functional-and-sorta-OO language and a OO-ish language.<p>I had a different experience in 6.034 than you did, I suppose. I think Scheme suited the class well and offered a nice way to express searches, minimizations, and decision systems. I'm sure you can do everything you can do in Scheme in Python but you could also do it in Java. Functional languages are particularly well-suited to these tasks. I wouldn't necessarily pick Scheme, though. Why not use the most appropriate tool for the job? If students have to learn a new language, OK. If you really do think Python is the best tool, OK.",1242032014

603186,comment,602478,603107,0,0,froo,,,"Well the thing is that is one of the conclusions we came too after having built a prototype. I'm not a skinny guy (nor was my partner), we built the thing for personal use and after several months of use we had found that it was simply too much additional effort that a simple meal plan could accomplish on is own. There were several things we didn't account for in our initial design.<p>1) Battery life on the mobile phone... Keeping your GPS on during waking hours is a big drain in current generation phones<p>2) People sticking to the plan (ours was designed so that you could go ""off plan"" if you felt hungry and it would adapt) ... during early testing if you skipped things, it could go out of whack<p>3) Motivation, we let several people use it, not including ourselves (about 15 all up) and we monitored the use and we found that in almost all cases (except 1) that people just stopped using it after around a month, with it's novelty wearing off after about two weeks. That's when we started to look at how the business models of other Dietary businesses work.<p>Basically, it had little more than novelty value - a simple meal plan and exercise would have achieved the same result.<p>(On a personal note, I found it just as easy to ride my exercise bike while watching TV and eating smaller portions to keep losing weight, I just bought smaller plates and glasses to change my perspective of the amount of food I was eating.)",1242030855

Since I've been doing them, I've alleviated all the back pain which I used to get after training and matches.<p>The only thing I'd say is that the plank exercises may not be the best exercises for people with a reall weak core.

I find that I get by just fine with my $1000 pc laptop running SUSE and Vista. I'd consider it the best laptop available because it does everything I need and cost me helluva lot less than a macbook, with comparable specs.

It's linux without the hassle - a paradise for hackers.<p>If you spend a lot of your life on a laptop, then buying cheap is a bad idea. It's a false economy.
It's funny when people moan that Apple are expensive. All laptops are ridiculously cheap when you consider what they enable you to do. They last 2-3 years, and over that time you could have used one to build an entire company. Might as well buy a good one.",1242029825

Man, you could smell the scent of those 5 1/4"" Nashua floppies as soon as you get out of the elevator!<p>ME TOO, My friends and I would carefully select the games over the week and then we couldn't wait until Saturday to get them. In fact, one day we almost got pickpocketed in the subway, and our concern was not our money or wallet, but protecting our floppies!! pretty hilarious now that I think about it...<p>At some point they published a book to hack the games so you'd get infinite lives. My friends and I figured out the assembly hex code for ""minus one"" (i. e.: one less life) and soon we were able to hack a bunch of games by looking for that byte alone throughout the memory.<p>Also we would hang-out at DDX. I lived my entire life in Vila Mariana (a Sao Paulo neighborhood), and we would just hang-out there with the guy who designed the mega-ram and the msx2 clone boards. The guy was doing pretty hardcore stuff, pure hacking... He would be considered a hero here in the US, but unfortunately in Brazil we don't recognize such talent...<p>There are still various MSX fan-clubs alive all over the world, and there are quite a few open source emulators.

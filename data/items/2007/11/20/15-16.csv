Compilers, interpreters, & language design (which have always been a hobby of mine).<p>I'll also second what everyone else said about learning Lisp, Smalltalk, early windowing systems, UNIX fundamentals, and other forgotten areas of the history of computing.  There're lots of good ideas in there. ",1195573979

It's a concurrent distributed-programming language & runtime based on the join calculus (which if I had to describe it would be ""pattern matching over processes"", a pretty nifty idea in itself).  I looked at it fairly briefly in college and it seemed really interesting, but wasn't mature enough to really do much with.  Given how it's popping up now, that may have changed...",1195573825

I remember seeing a single letter on a breadboard E-ink display years ago, and since then I've wanted a reader with that surface. It seems like everyone that handles one wants it. The ideal is an entire library of books in your back pocket, that 'feels/reads' like a regular book. It is getting closer, but the Kindle does seem like a baby step back from the Sony reader.",1195573351

Or join an open-source project and learn enough about their codebase that you can start helping out people who ask questions.<p>Almost everything that's relaxing in the sense of ""feels like TV"" isn't go to be a good education.  That doesn't mean learning can't be fun, but it means you have to set aside a block of time and let yourself sink into the material instead of glossing over it in 30 minute chunks.<p>I've also found time spent socially interacting with folks over the web - in an ""involving yourself in their life"" sense, not in a ""post on the same message board"" sense - to be very rewarding.  Several online friends have since become RL friends after a couple years of commenting on their LiveJournal and talking to them on AIM.  LiveJournal is great for this, FaceBook not so much, since the culture on FaceBook is very much about taking pre-existing RL friends and interacting with them online.",1195573200

81943,comment,81823,81823,0,0,iamwil,,,"I kinda disagree with some of his points.  <p>1) ""Android apps are written in Java""  \nI haven't delved into the deeper end of things, but I suspect that it will be a matter of time before people start putting other compilers on there.  I mean, Jython and JRuby are implementations of Python and Ruby for use on a JVM.  So given that the phone is as open as it claims to be, it should eventually happen.  I know the Haxe people are talking about porting Haxe onto android.  I'm going to guess it's just a starting point to use Java.<p>As for the middle layers being closed, I don't see it mentioned explicitly in the design overview, and a browser is in the app layer, not the framework layer so you can replace that for sure.<p>2) ""the installable application is dead""\nTo think that a mobile platform is simply a smaller web that you can take with you is a bit misguided, I think.  As an example, currently, no web browser provides GPS data from the user.  There's a plugin for firefox, but that's about it.  So (as an example) until mobile browsers provide geo-location, you'll be limiting yourself to writing applications that confer the advantages of the web, but not of the advantages of a mobile device.  <p>Native applications will still have their place.  Just as TV didn't replace the radio completely, web apps won't completely replace native apps.<p>His other points seem to be better justified, but at this point, no one knows.  Only time will tell.",1195572954

If a user were to crack the cookie and change the user_id to, say, 1 (which is often an admin account), it could be a HUGE security vulnerability.<p>I'm not even sure using a ""really good"" secret password would be a good enough security measure, since the user can do the brute forcing locally.

81931,comment,58025,58025,0,0,MiklosHollender,,,"1. Seems to me Paul partly rediscovered Buddhism: great Buddhist philosophers of the Great Middle Way school use philosophy to demonstrate philosophy does not work. There is a great analysis of it:<p><a href=""http://www.bahai-library.org/personal/jw/other.pubs/nagarjuna/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.bahai-library.org/personal/jw/other.pubs/nagarjun...</a><p>(This is where the Great Middle Way comes from: the middle way between existence and non-existence. We can prove Berkeley wrong just by kicking stone: it would be wrong to assert that that the phenomena don't exist in the casual, everyday sense. However, they don't exist in that sense that if we look deep into it the entity we casually define as a ""stone"" does not actually have a true and lasting essence, or identity.)<p>2. However, I believe philosophy, even though usually it is a bluff, is a necessary evil. How can we talk about politics without philosophy? How can one have any political  opinion without at least having some ideas of what ""good"", esp. ""a good life"" is? (OK you can be an anarcho-capitalist  without it but otherwise basically both Liberalism and Conservativism requires some definition of ""good"".)<p>Miklos Hollender",1195571199
81930,comment,81722,81803,0,0,tjic,,,"I have no moral opposition to contract work - I've been a contractor, and I've hired contractors.<p>There's a trade off.<p>Contractors cost more per unit time than do employees (in the short term), and are usually looking for the next gig.  At a startup, we don't have tons of free cash, but we do have tons of potential.  We'd rather reward someone with a promise of sharing in our success (which we have) than with twice as much cash (which we don't have).<p>As far as working on site versus off site: again, I have no moral objection to this, and I've done it myself.  However, I'm not just hiring engineers to produce lines of code: I'm hiring them for their wide-ranging intelligence, their ability to contribute to the ideas bouncing around the office, and their ability to tell me when my ideas are full of shit.  All of this takes place much more easily in an office.  Finally, while most people who work remotely are professional about it, I have noticed that it becomes easier for someone to disengage, grow tired or frustrated, and mentally ""check out""...and it's harder for me to detect this, and take appropriate action (a word of encouragement, an announcement that we're all bagging work for an hour to go get a burrito on the company's dime, or whatever else).<p>As much as I like the IDEA of remote work, and easily compartmentalized tasks, I have come to believe that humans have evolved to be highly social, and to work best when they are immersed in a social environment.<p>I note that Joel Spolsky has company lunches every day, and considers this important.\n",1195571164

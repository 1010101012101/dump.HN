296460,story,,,4,6,jamongkad,"Ask HN: Know any good Email Servers?",,"My company's web app is currently going through private beta testing. But as time goes by I'm starting to see that email integration is such a MUST for users that it's almost automatic for them to expect that the web app their using will inform them of any actions through their email.<p>I have experience setting up VPS's and such but I have no experience whatsoever setting up a good email server. I guess the best place to start is Google. But HN has been such a valuable repository of information and experience that I would find it idiotic of me to not tap into the collective intelligence here.<p>So my question is do you guys know any good email servers? something a bootstrap startup can afford for the mean time. Thank you!",1220662530

296456,comment,295822,296033,0,0,hugh,,,"Personally I'd take the second deal, but that's just because I don't consider $1 million to really be ""fuck you"" money at all -- it'd buy me a nice house and give me a good head start, but it wouldn't let me retire and spend the rest of my life doing whatever-the-hell-I-want the way $20 million would.<p>His point still stands, of course, if you multiply the numbers by something. Make it a 50% chance of $10 million vs a 20% chance of $200 million, and I'd probably take the first deal.",1220662406

296451,comment,296399,296399,0,0,jfew,,,"Where's the burndown chart (or any task effort estimates at all)?  Where do I maintain my product backlog?  This tool feels more suited to something like XP or generic Agile than pure Scrum to me.<p>But that's the problem with project management tools: everyone's got a different mental model for organizing work and measuring output because nobody strictly follows all the practices of any one methodology to the letter (""Agile is empirical,"" after all).  You adopt the practices that work for you and your team, which means you have to create your own project management tools adapted to that unique workflow (unless you're lucky enough to find the tools that someone else created meet your needs perfectly).<p>Otherwise, you're forced to adapt your workflow to the tools you choose.",1220661970

296448,comment,296440,296440,0,0,brk,,,"There is nothing ""special"" about Web 2.0, other than you likely need something with a decent database option.<p>I'd look at something like Slicehost, or more of a hosted server vs. shared server solution.  Skip EC2 for now, and other things that are a little too progressive.  You need (IMO) a solid stable base first, then look into elasticity when you get some mass.<p>If you want/need a dedicated server, send me an email I can get you setup with something nice.",1220661850

If you sleep 8 hours a night and do nothing else with your life except read blog posts, you still have to read 180 articles per hour - 16 hours a day, 7 days a week.<p>I'm curious about your comprehension.

296430,comment,294918,296281,0,0,asnyder,,,"NOLOH does not translate PHP to JavaScript, certain aspects of NOLOH use JavaScript, but no translation takes place. The 1.8 release of NOLOH will allow for your applications to run with or without JavaScript enabled.<p>The fundamental difference between Cappuccino and NOLOH is that unlike Cappuccino, GWT, Silverlight, Java, Flash, etc, a NOLOH application is not a compiled application living on your local machine, which means you don't download the entire application, rather it's lightweight and on-demand. Because of this you can write things such as Amazon.com in NOLOH, as well as things like 280Slides, all while having a smaller footprint, but maintaining a unified application lifecycle. This also has other benefits such as being able to modify your application while it's running, as seen in the Hello World video. See <a href=""http://www.noloh.com/#/section=features"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.noloh.com/#/section=features</a> for more information.<p>There will be Python and Ruby versions of NOLOH in the near future.<p>I recommend you play around with NOLOH a bit more before making these statements. Please note that I wasn't belittling Cappucinno in any way, I was suggesting that if he was more comfortable with things like PHP, Python, etc, that NOLOH might be a better fit for him, rather than having the equivalent of a thick client application.",1220659782

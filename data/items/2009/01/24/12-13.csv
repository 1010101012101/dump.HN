Actually, the worst for me is ... my mail client (especially since it has my RSS feeds in there).<p>I've gotten into a routine of waking up and spending about half an hour on mail / news and then switching on Freedom.app for 2-3 hours to turn off my networking.  I leave the local intranet connected so that if I really need to find some piece of info I can SSH to another box and use lynx.  This helps me get into the groove most days.<p><a href=""http://www.ibiblio.org/fred/freedom/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ibiblio.org/fred/freedom/</a>",1232801999

448051,comment,447166,448012,0,0,fauigerzigerk,,,"Right, your new rule is, write you own framework/library if necessary, otherwise use what's there. That's much better than your original rule which ruled out any use of frameworks as no frameworks could ever have been created.<p>But Im' still not happy :) I'm sure a lot of popular frameworks were created without any necessity, simply because they were fun to make. Some turned out to have qualities that nobody (including its creator) would have been able to spell out beforehand.",1232801051

448043,comment,446666,446666,0,0,almost,,,"Lots of fun :) Reminds me of the time at a previous job when I had to incorporate distance measurement based on post codes (zipcodes, UK style). There wasn't a whole lot to do for long periods at this job (which is why I left it eventually) so I spent several days making pretty pictures from the postcode data. I was quite amused that the density of codes in London was such that I could see the Thames winding through the middle :)<p>I also spent a while trying to guess polygon data for the post districts from just the point data for each code. I found that quite hard at the time.",1232800661
448041,comment,445959,446001,0,0,wheels,,,"An API would be great for HN since it would allow the community to do all of the sorts of things that it's interested in around rather than on HN.  It'd be the ultimate meta-customization.  :-)<p>Here's how I would break it down:<p><pre><code>  - List of [top / newest] topics\n    - Number of points\n    - Time submitted\n    - Sumitter\n    - Upvote / downvote calls\n    - List of comments\n      - Submitter\n      - Text\n      - Points\n      - Upvote / downvote calls\n  - User\n    - Description\n    - Comments\n    - Points\n</code></pre>\nAnd then let the mashups flourish.  It would seem fitting for HN.  I'd be interested enough that I'd do a patch for such if there were a reasonable chance of it being integrated.  I personally would really dig being able to see who upvoted what since that would let me do the magic that's my specialty and be able to organize top stories personally based on my a users upvoting patterns, but I suspect that might be undesirable for reason of keeping things anonymous.",1232800454

I started with although this might be a controversial question.......because the question is Is HN a waste of time, from that question you might get the idea that I am speaking of HN only.<p>It seems that you have come up with a sentencing formula which is bad in all circumstances. Maybe you should write a research report upon it, it certainly might be interesting. My academic training has taught me though that one should be weary of generalising.<p>I personally do not agree with your line of thinking that if you have an embarrassing question keep it to yourself. There might be many smart people here, but I do not usually refrain myself from asking a dumb question if I feel that it might shed some light regarding some issue.<p>Am I or this post wasting peoples time? I did think a bit about that before I posted it and concluded that if it was a waste of peoples time it would not attract comments or upvotes.<p>Thanks for your comment anyway, an interesting way of saying that the post was a waste of time without actually saying so, and further, an interesting way of wasting other peoples time while saying that my post was a waste of time. :P",1232798881

Sometimes, seemingly randomly, I'll be logged in again after my previous visit didn't have me logged in.  It seems to be cookie related, but I'm not sure how to debug this (especially since none of my other regular sites are experiencing the same issue).",1232798584

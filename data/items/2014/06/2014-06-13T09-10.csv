It immediately resonated with me; it described a principle I had been trying to achieve in some code I was writing recently.  The idea of having changes automatically propagate through your model as a data-flow network is a pretty noticeable contrast to other ways of programming.<p>> He was one of the main proponents of Reactive programming inside Microsoft.<p>Yeah I guess I don&#x27;t have this context.

So, yes, you can do &quot;sum range hugeNumber&quot;, but the compiler will tell you that your program can&#x27;t be run at the correct frequency. (The possible range of the `hugeNumber` variable is known to the compiler, so it can know the maximum size of the list you are asking.)<p>The compiler can find out the range of numbers and the lengths of lists using static analysis, because SolScript is such a &quot;restricted&quot; language. Functional programmers would probably dump all that information into a type system. We call it &quot;dataflow analysis&quot;, but I think the end result is the same.<p>Note that, all of the static analysis is done on the dataflow graph underlying a SolScript program. In the dataflow graph there are no &quot;functions&quot; or &quot;classes&quot;... The static analysis is much simpler because it is done on something more primitive than the language itself.",1402650050

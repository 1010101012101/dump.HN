In the day to day actions of waking, working, and sleeping until the next day we tend to lose sight of the longterm goal. At least I do. I am somewhat reassured my younger sister will live long enough, though I am not sure about my mom. I've had to accept my grandmother won't, as my grandad died in March. This is a good reminder to all of us who think there is an answer.",1227695143

Think Doppler effect.  The NSA will explain this to Obama; and while he might still consult his blackberry from time to time, it won't be present during sensitive meetings (and when you get right down to it, pretty much every non-public meeting at which the president is present qualifies as ""sensitive"").",1227695143

So, I don't see a prima facie reason that there can't be a best overall algorithm for the problems we tend to encounter, since these are an infinitely small subset of all possible problems and likely share common characteristics.<p>In fact, to be a total contrarian, I suspect intelligent design theory can provide such a heuristic for all real world problem domains.

He wants to remain in contact with people outside the 10-12 people surrounding him daily.<p>Some Issues \n""A president's e-mail may be subject to public records laws and can be subpoenaed by Congress and the courts. It may also be a security risk for him to carry a traceable cell phone.""<p>I think one of the main things is definitely security risk. Rest of the issues can be dealt by lawyers ;)<p>I am really interested in hearing opinions about the security implications of owning a cellphone and blackberry in specific. Most likely there would be additional effort/technology that would be needed to make his phone/PDA untraceable. This definitely makes Secret services job much much harder. His security can be compromised quite easily by skilled hackers. At the same time I think in todays age the President should be well equipped with communication devices that enable him to do his job better. \nWhat do you think?",1227694244

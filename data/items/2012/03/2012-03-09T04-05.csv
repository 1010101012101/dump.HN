Just try searching for XML Config Transforms as that's theoretically the clean way of solving this problem. It's only natively supported for certain projects, can be hacked into more via manually editting MSBUILD and CSPROJ files and worst of all, breaks miserably during the Azure deploy as VS simply skips some of MSBUILD files and simply decides to package things from your original source tree as it sees fit. Meaning it completely and utterly fails at the one good thing it can do as it only works in fairly contrived situations.<p>This means I have to manually edit connection strings, debug  settings and more that vary between our local ASP.NET servers, our intranet dev server, our local emulator environment and then debug/prod Azure instances.<p>If I'm mistaken I would be ecstatic to be corrected. Hell, I'd have paid money out of pocket for a macro/conditional solution for this problem when I was working on this project. Also, if it's just too off-topic, please accept my sincere apologies.

The oversized new UI feels like a constrained toy to me, compared to my usual file manager(s).<p>On my desktop I can make icons 16px and easily manage hundreds of files and folders without even scrolling, or switch to a thumbnail view if I need to see larger pictures. The Dropbox web UI, on the other hand, has only one view option that seems ideal for neither documents nor pictures, and it doesn't make any use of horizontal space beyond the hard-coded 960 pixels. So it still feels too much like a website and not enough like a file manager application.<p>But that's not necessarily a bad thing. Large icons and bare-bones interfaces might make it easier for people to perform simple tasks on a small number of items. Besides, not everyone is looking for Finder/Nautilus/Windows Explorer when they open Dropbox on the web. In fact, I guess most people use one of those desktop apps to manage their Dropbox most of the time anyway.",1331267687

If the question we ask ourselves is ""How are we here?"" then the next logical question has to be ""How is the stuff outside of our direct perception here?"" And then ""How is the stuff outside the stuff outside our direct perception here?"" And so on and so forth forever.<p>It's then that I think to myself: <i>Well then the universe must not work on beginnings and ends, human perception is inherently flawed and the universe is incomprehensible.</i><p>Thats a pretty boring answer. So instead lets think about that hypothetical first being to create a simulation of sentient beings. That first being, lets call them Omega, can never be sure that they're Omega.

At some point though the landscape of computing fundamentally changes and the languages have to adapt and generally new ones more well suited for that landscape emerge. If you enjoy staying with the state of the art with computing many times using the latest languages is more complementary. For example their are languages that make parallel programming far more tolerable than some of the older but not old languages such as Java or C#. At some point as parallel becomes more and more important they will gain in popularity. That being said, if that does not interest you, you can always choose to sunset with your current languadge of choice. There will be a period where this is not a lucrative proposition, but as it ages and talent in the technology is lost to attrition, it can be as lucrative if not more than staying with the latest and greatest. For example COBOL developers and mainframe developers are now in high demand, it is not unreasonable to command 200k in either of those fields and they will most likely not be overcrowded as people are not flocking in droves to those technologies. But generally you have to chose one of the two paths, either you stick with what you know and sunset or you become the perpetual learner. I chose the latter because I love following along with where we are heading. But there is no shame in taking the other path. I have many friends that did and they are very happy with their choice.",1331266620

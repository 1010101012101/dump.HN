There are 12 comparations between the <i>Arial</i> and the <i>Dyslexie</i> fonts, but only 2 of then have p<.1 and none of them has p<.05. So it is very difficult to know if the differences between the fonts are real or come from random noise.<p>They made a font that they <i>think</i> is better for people with dyslexia, they tried it, but they found almost no difference. This work is only a master thesis, so perhaps they are planning to continue working on this. But for now it is not a ""cure"" for dyslexia.<p>---<p>I think that the problem is that they didnt do enough ""beta""-testing. (Perhaps they did it, but it is not in the thesis.) With infinity time, money and resources, they should:<p>* Find a small group people with dyslexia.<p>* Do some  A/B testing on them for one year. Compare two fonts with very little difference. For example in one font the dot of the i has the normal size and in the other font the dot is bigger.<p>* Perhaps, from time to time, change the group of people, to be sure that the font is good for ""normal"" people with dyslexia, not only for the trained group that is in the laboratory.<p>* Perhaps, from time to time, try some bigger changes, but measure the improvement.<p>* Find a new bigger group people with dyslexia.<p>* Compare with this people the difference between the original and the final font.",1310479125

2754648,comment,2754256,2754538,2,0,kls,,,"As a dyslexic and with only a little knowledge of Spanish I would say that it is probably true. When I was learning the little bit of Spanish I know it did seem easier to infer the correct word and spelling. In the end that is what a lot of dyslexics learn to do to cope. They infer the word. Many times they get them wrong but with certain fonts it is easier than trying to read it.<p>One thing about this issue that never really gets covered is that with repetition dyslexics can improve their condition. One of the main reasons I read and post it to ensure that I am constantly working to improve my ability to do so. Many times kids become discouraged and end up abandoning written language due to difficulties with their condition. It only serves to worsen their condition. I for example was given a computer at an early age to help with my dyslexia, I was allowed to submit all papers typed and I was excused from handwriting assignments due to being deemed to have a learning disability. This was both a blessing and a curse, it was a blessing because I became exposed to computers but a curse in the fact that to this day I am functionally illiterate when it comes to handwriting. My handwriting looks more akin to sandscript than English. I can read it and understand it, but to someone else it is an entirely different language. Fortunately they have better policies for learning disabilities now days and use a combined approach.<p>On an unrelated note, there are a lot of dyslexics (the ones that don't get discouraged or use their condition as a crutch) that end up in the math and science fields. It has been theorized that these people's ability to see textual items as 3D objects some how aids in their ability to visualize abstract concepts.<p>I know when I do higher level math I do not see numbers. I see objects that are represented by the numbers. I think for many just starting out in higher maths, variables are a difficult concept, but when you see each items as a object it helps one to look at all items in a equation as a variable some just have known values. I think dyslexics grasp this concept earlier because it is inherently how their mind works. Unfortunately many dyslexics never make it that far due to years of failing in academics.",1310477923

The whole experience is just begging to install a nice home theater and since one cannot (legally) watch current movies while they are in theaters.. pirating surely becomes an option.<p>Movie theaters and current movie distribution are a concept from the stone age when people could not afford to view them at home; they are a fossil in terms of modern technology and possibilities.

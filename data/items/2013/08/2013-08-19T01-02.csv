6235173,comment,6233687,6233980,4,0,axman6,,,"Jesus christ, what is wrong with all you people? Somehow, firefighters in america have become the bad guys? They fucked up in an incredibly difficuly situation, and because of it, a young girl is dead. Do you have any idea how traumatic this must be for the officers involved? This policy is not about &quot;if you&#x27;ve got nothing to hide, you&#x27;ve got nothing to worry about&quot;, it&#x27;s about protecting the people who literally risk their lives for the rest of us; protecting them and the families of those affected from public exposure of horrific events such as these. If your daughter was killed in a horrific accident like this, would you want video of the event and her mutilated corpse shown to people around the world? I have a feeling most of you would not. And the same would be said if you had been the person who was responsible for killing them.<p>Clearly one, or several, people fucked up on the ground, and somehow this has turned into a debate about how bureaucrats are trying to protect themselves from &quot;their fuckups&quot;. This had nothing to do with the bureaucrats, it has to do with the men on the ground, and the whole situation is truly horrific for them.<p>I&#x27;m all for police officers wearing cameras (at least in the US where abuses of power seem to be the norm), but I am also vehemently against the idea that emergency service officers should be subjected to the same treatment. Their job is incredibly difficult and dangerous. Sometimes mistakes happen, and sometimes those mistakes are incredibly regretful, but I feel that these officers being forced to fear every action they make will mean they cannot do their job effectively. We do not live in a society where we can expect 100% perfection 100% of the time, form anyone at all. I would rather have firefighters who occasionally screw up, than none at all.<p>The sentiment in these comments has I find deeply disturbing, and completely misdirected, and I feel that many of the commenters here should stop and think about who is most affected by their statements. I&#x27;d hate to be one of the officers involved, and then to see the sort of crap that&#x27;s been said here.",1376877382

They see drugs (along with alcohol and sex and a raft of other things) as something the government should regulate for the betterment of society.

The &quot;public folder&quot; for sharing data on the Windows operating system is accessible via the %ALLUSERSPROFILE% environment variable [0], and has been so since Windows XP.  That means at least 15+ years now.  On OS X, there is /Users/Shared, but I am not sure how old this convention is old enough for me to presume it started with the earliest versions of OS X.  Unix has been way ahead of the game, but in different variations, and if you include/exclude Linux as standardized, you can read the FHS standard regarding where files ought to go.<p>Having said that, this does not mean these folder arrangements detract from your argument.  Windows was not originally designed to be a multi-user/multi-tenant system, and evolved from a one-user turd to a multi-user turd (albeit a shinier, polished, more refined one).  OS X roots in Unix dictate it should be better but it is not.  Outside of Windows, it is largely software developers obvious intentions or programmatic error. In the case of Windows, there later turn around was not honored by developers, some long gone (out of business or not interested), who refused or continue to refuse convention regarding standard, like the All Users Profile.  Windows has a lot of indirection APIs that layer over the OS so people can write to the same registry and file locations they should have not been using for 10+ years, that are in system-file only resource areas or require admin privileges to run and access system features they most certainly do not need.  iTunes, as a different kind of example, regardless of OS, is a trend of a-hole software companies dictating how and where you use data you own.  You can move a iTunes library, but it is annoying and DRM means the benefits are useless anyway.  It is not like you need an exclusive lockfile to play a MP3, you need to buy into their exclusive ecosystem of garbage and put a lockfile on all of your computing choices.  But that is another topic.<p>Point being, only Unix was <i>designed</i> for multi-user tenancy.  I am not saying well, but it was made for by large corportations and research groups to share data.  The others were modified later to do so, and at a cost, as developers out of the game or too disinterested to pivot ignored/ignore these changes.  The end user does not care, so why follow the rules?  I get your point, but I think it is wise to assume this issue is far more socio-political then technical.<p>We are humans, we no likey sharey.<p>[0] <a href=""http://ss64.com/nt/syntax-variables.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ss64.com/nt/syntax-variables.html</a>",1376876095

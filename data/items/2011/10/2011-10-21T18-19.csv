3141153,comment,3140901,3140901,26,0,ubercore,,,"I'm having the opposite reaction. I find myself fighting against iOS most of the time. The browser zooms to odd proportion on most pages, and I really miss the double-tap to zoom for one-handed browsing. Reading a notification, and having no direct path back to where you came from (answering a txt message, for instance) feels really clunky. The lack of widgets feels outdated and dogmatic, rather than useful. Being able to put a contact on my home screen, click once to open ways to communicate and a second time to email/txt/call/facebook is amazingly useful to me, because I generally contact only a few people on a regular basis.<p>And if you expand to include the ecosystem, it's not even close. The iCloud web apps are pathetic compared to Google's offerings.<p>I could go on. And this isn't just bashing, I'm growing to like a lot about iOS, but I think these Android vs iOS stories are mostly link bait. They're a lot more similar than most people will admit, and both have plusses and minuses.<p>EDIT: Ok click to zoom is kinda there, but I like the way it works on Android better. That's just a preference, so I'll strike that from my list of objections.",1319223593

It's hard to overestimate how deeply personal <i>Cars</i> and <i>Cars 2</i> are to John, but it's also hard to overstate how tricky they were to pull off.<p>Sure, you can criticize <i>Cars 2</i> for having a story that didn't hit the bullseye.  Totally fair, by Pixar's own ""story, story, story"" standards.  But don't think the Pixar Brain Trust didn't do so first (as mentioned in the article, things had indeed gone wrong) or that they didn't do heroic acts to make things work.  Ultimately it's an artistic process within a movie studio and you sometimes have to put things into production and trust that you can work out the problems.  Pixar will bend everything out of shape to delay that point but it still happens.  It's the fact that Pixar had done so well rescuing movies from a burning story that makes the rest of us forget that sometimes.<p>Still, where <i>Cars</i> and <i>Cars 2</i> started from and how well the stories they had were executed  I think those things are hard to criticize.  These movies are love letters to the automotive culture that came of age as John did, and they are both put on the screen with a huge amount of artistry, character, cleverness and humor.",1319222800

3141099,comment,3140901,3140901,18,0,Pewpewarrows,,,"For the uninformed, these are two separate issues.<p>The first is that apps are laggy or jittery during scrolling or animations. This is partially due to poor coding from developers, but the main reason for its existence was the lack of hardware acceleration on Android devices. This changed with 3.0 on tablets, and now 4.0 on everything. Developers still have to opt-in with a one-line XML file change, due to compatibility issues. So in essence this has been solved across the board.<p>The second is what a lot of users are now referring to (and was largely masked by the presence of the former problem). And it's that there's a much larger drag distance required to ""initiate"" user interaction on Android than iOS. When I pick up a friend's iPhone, it seems like if a hair on my finger even grazes the screen the UI immediately (and appropriately) reacts. On every Android device that I've ever used, it takes approximately 0.5 to 1.0 centimeters before the UI will begin to react and scroll. This is what people mean when they say that it feels like you're ""pulling"" the UI on Android, while iOS has 1:1 natural interaction.<p>Is it annoying? Yes. But after moderate use I stop noticing it, until I happen to touch an iOS device again. Now that Ice Cream Sandwich has taken care of every other fault with the platform I had, this is really the last item on my list of complaints, having used Android devices for years on a near-daily basis. I don't know if it's a problem with the hardware of the screen sensors themselves or with the levels of abstraction to Java-land, but this should be their top priority for what I can only assume they'll call Jelly Bean.",1319222757

Apple dragged this on for <i>months</i>, and it has been a constant stream of emails and 3-way phone calls. In the end, their Final Solution was this: he had to create a second LLC, add the third party as a ""member"" of this new company, get state documents certifying the existence of this LLC and the membership status of this third party, and a notarized letter from the third party authorizing the transfer.<p>The most recent issue was that Apple kept deleting the transfer request form because the name of his second LLC was too similar to the name of his first (seriously, Apple?).<p>Absolutely none of this is a technical problem; the whole reason he decided to go through this fiasco was to avoid breaking the upgrade path and losing all his reviews and stats (not to mention forcing his customers to lose data).

3140939,comment,3140133,3140466,1,0,nextparadigms,,,"It's a huge improvement and I'm very excited for it. One issue I have with it, though, is that I was hoping they'd make the virtual buttons appear ""on demand"" somehow, so you can take advantage of the ""full"" screen in all situations. But even better, they should've done something like in Meego Harmatan, where you go ""back"" or to the home page by sliding the screen to the side.<p>That could create an issue in games perhaps, if not done right, but they could've probably found a way to do it right. Matias himself says gestures are better than buttons, so he should've tried to get rid of those buttons completely, too. Then you could enjoy the full screen in all situations, and you could use the full ""HD"" resolution. Oh well, maybe they can implement it for Android 5.0 (right, Matias? - if you're reading this).",1319220754

3140932,comment,3137847,3137847,2,0,driverdan,,,"Having lived a previous life as a blackhat, ID thief, and credit card scammer I could write a book (and may someday) about hacks I came up with. Here are a few:<p>I sold fake IDs at college. The real IDs were plastic cards and had multi-spectrum holograms, something you can't easily fake. Combining methods I found on the internet with my own discoveries I created simulated holograms using clear spray paint, lamination pouches, Pearlex pigment powder, Alps thermal printer, and a bad ass laminator. They were good enough to pass most bouncers in-state and was told that one passed a cop.<p>Our college IDs could be used at campus stores, vending machines, etc. The mag stripe just had your school ID encoded on it. If you had a mag stripe encoder (like me) and knew someone's ID you could encode it onto your own ID (or a fake one you printed yourself, like I did). The problem was finding school ID numbers.<p>To communicate with students there was a set of folders outside the main office of each department. Each student had their own folder, sorted in alphabetical order. This was also where you got your grades at the end of the quarter. I realized that your grades had your full student ID number listed (which was also your SSN!). All I had to do was go through the folders and find grades other students hadn't picked up yet to get their ID numbers.<p>Luckily the school stopped printing full numbers on student correspondence not long after that.",1319220723

The notion of humans as super rational utility maximisers was entirely an economic model, and it was that they attacked. It was well known (for over twenty years before their seminal 1974 science paper) that humans were poor at probability and utility judgments.<p>What they did do, was force the economic profession to face up (somewhat) to these issues, and their contribution to loss aversion and prospect theory more generally, is a significant advance.<p>That being said, their dual process models are about as predictive as those of Freud (which is to say, not at all). its currently a really active phase of research, so I suppose I can thank them for making it easier for me to get funding.<p>They also did not invent priming, though they made heavy use of it. Likewise framing effects were well known before them, going back at least to Asch 1951 study of conformity in judgements of line length.<p>To summate, Kahneman is an amazing scientist, but this reporter does not appear to know much about what he is talking about.",1319220331

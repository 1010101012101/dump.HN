Microsoft is a monopolist because they have a serious majority of the market, used completely undocumented features of their OS in their Apps, and particpated in extremely unfair trade practices.<p>Apple is busting an entrenched industry.  This is good.  Its possible that Apple will become the new Microsoft indeed.  But they are so laughably far from this status the PC world article remains equally ridiculous.",1189211566

How does Apple get away with bundling Safari, Mail, iChat, iLife, etc with Mac OS X when that is what Microsoft ran into trouble with in the EU? <p>The only difference I can see is market share. Not that I'm complaining. I like some of those desktop apps.",1189210650

A friend gained access to the Windows LAN Manager passwords and cracked them, getting access to login and passwords of the entire freshman Engineering class. On a separate occasion, he noticed a windows folder share on a server which contained the logs for the Engineering departments student portal. The logs contained every login attempt with the login and password stored in plain text! Not kidding.<p>So he told the department system admins and they basically shrugged him off.. Maybe now they've learned their lesson?",1189209934

And such messaging apps use the user credentials on their own server(s) to keep the users online and reachable.

6464764,comment,6464138,6464138,24,0,pyalot2,,,"Note that you should avoid using this (or anything else with JS) to emulate shortcuts.<p>The reason is because what this usually looks like &quot;oh nice I can define shortcuts people can press&quot;. What it actually means is: &quot;Ohcrap, that shortcut only works for US-US 104 keyboard layouts, and about 80% of people can&#x27;t press that shortcut&quot;.<p>For example: suppose you want a shortcut for shift+/, which is for the US keyboard under the small right finger. But that shortcut can&#x27;t be defined for SG (swiss-german) because there the / is on the numeric bar where 7 is. So if you assume (for whatever reason) that left+right small finger is a convenient shortcut, and left small finger + right index finger top isn&#x27;t, then you&#x27;re totally screwed. Instead, to reach the right small finger low on swiss german, you&#x27;d have to define shift + &quot;-&quot;. Except that if you define that, it&#x27;ll be one of the most uncomfortable keyboard shortcuts imaginable for US users, which find - on the numeric row top --> bottom left small finger + top right small finger = ugh.<p>The truth is that you cannot do reasonable shortcut definition the way that everybody would like to with JS... yet.<p>But wait, can&#x27;t you like, define some reasonable presets and let people choose their own? The answer is no, because you don&#x27;t have a reliable way to translate a keydown/keyup to a unicode char, and the unicode char is related to the modifier keys, not the key cap, so though you can do that shortcut definition, you can&#x27;t show to the user what that shortcut definition actually is, because it&#x27;d be either undefined or completely wrong.<p>I&#x27;ve written at length about this here: <a href=""http://codeflow.org/entries/2013/jan/30/keyboard-events-in-javascript-are-broken/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://codeflow.org/entries/2013/jan/30/keyboard-events-in-j...</a>",1380451468

6464753,comment,6462216,6463412,3,0,waps,,,"Having done some automation with actual robots, I must disagree. Determining what needs doing is a policy problem. Sure there may be variables, but it seems to me essentially you have a priority list, a list of workers and other resources, and essentially a bucket fill algorithm. Further enhancement might be to verify that the store is actually operational during all the different times (e.g. at 6pm, refill the fries before you do the cash register counting, even though the cash register stuff is more important in the end). Add to that that you can make significant mistakes and not have real consequences. In fact you could screw up a few things and still have better overall results than a human planner. And manna like planners are pretty normal in<p>Doesn&#x27;t sound like it&#x27;s a huge problem to me.<p>Having a 3 segment robot arm pick up a salt shaker requires balancing 7 codependent feedback loops, while constantly checking if you&#x27;re hitting anything and requires constant evaluation of forward and inverse kinematics. As if that problem is not bad enough, you have to do it not just fast, but in real-time (as in, you have to calculate all this at ~50hz at least. If a single decision takes 100 msec, you&#x27;ve just damaged or lost the robot). State of the art in robotics is picking up and unboiled egg 10 times without breaking it, and most robots can&#x27;t do it. If you start to use those robots to hand people burgers, expect broken bones at least, casualties at worst.<p>Replacing a burger flipper requires solving not one, but actually most unsolved AI problems. You need voice recognition + understanding. Okay that&#x27;s one. Then you need to understand the meaning in what was actually said. You know, the problem that google&#x27;s 35000 employees from amongst the &quot;world&#x27;s best&quot; don&#x27;t quite know how to solve. I mean, they&#x27;re far ahead of the pack, but nowhere near open-ended conversations with a human, never mind doing so with social grace. If your robot can walk around you need to manage an unsolved 30-dimensional feedback loop problem. State of the art for that problem is pathetic as well[1][2]. If it can&#x27;t walk around you have other problems, and it&#x27;s still at least a 14-dimensional feedback problem (two six-dimensional arms + 2 grippers). There&#x27;s the mechanical problem of creating a robot that stays robust when working with &quot;gooey&quot; stuff like food (it will build up inside the robot, then fail or cause overheating). Then you need to solve all the problems that the &quot;manna&quot; system solves, or there&#x27;s no point having a robot in the first place.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjgkV77gVcs"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vjgkV77gVcs</a> (note the obviously reduced dimensionality that wouldn&#x27;t fly in the real world, and that the robot sees no problem moving through itself. It&#x27;s stability under disturbances is also not at the point that it would keep operating for long periods. Do that in real life and the thing will topple over)\n[2] And before you say Bigdog, note that 4 feet locomotion is a much simpler problem. Bigdog is solving for 8 dimensions, and that&#x27;s state of the art (and it is not sufficiently reliable to operate a single day without assistance). 2 feet locomotion in a human is ~140-dimensional, the minimum you can reduce it to while still having a nice mobile robot is 12-dimensional.",1380451025

Working on code in a large and ever changing team is very difficult, and it seems to benefit from less abstraction, even if it leads to more verbose code. That&#x27;s the whole secret of Java. I&#x27;ve been implementing a small part of my current project in Go and it has similar benefits.<p>That said, when working alone or with one or two others, I feel kind of dumb repeating some things over and over at the same level of abstraction.

  R defaulted(const V& val, const R& default_val) {

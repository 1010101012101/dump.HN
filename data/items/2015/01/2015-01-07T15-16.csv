And the more I consider this question the less &quot;clear cut&quot; the answer is.<p>If the OP walked into the pawnbroker, asked for the laptop, and then literally grabbed it and left (&quot;stole it&quot;) would they get away with it? Now, knee jerk answer is: &quot;no that is shoplifting&quot; but then when you consider they&#x27;d be shoplifting their own property that the pawn broken had illegally to begin with...<p>Legally (or even morally) it isn&#x27;t at all clear cut. In fact I don&#x27;t know how the law would fall in this scenario. The pawn broken almost certainly couldn&#x27;t sue the OP, it would be hard to prosecute it, and possession is 9/10ths of the law.<p>In fact this sounds like a super interesting question to give to a law class to debate.

Whiskey is a very difficult business to get good at.

The reason there are a lot of CAs and some of them are governments is that having rules and policies for what it takes to be a CA is way better than having some random neckbeard at a browser maker deciding he read something in the newspaper yesterday about your country he didn&#x27;t like, so you can&#x27;t be a CA.<p>If you wanted to, you could build a browser that&#x27;s a fork of Firefox/Chrome, and just doesn&#x27;t show the padlock when a CA that you believe is under the thumb of an authoritarian state is the signer. However you would then have to exclude all American and British CA&#x27;s, which would then exclude most SSLd sites, thus making your fork not much different to just deciding to never show any padlock at all and assert that everything is insecure so fuck it, let&#x27;s (not) go shopping.<p>OK ..... back here in reality, real browser makers understand that there are more adversaries than governments, and actually SSL was designed to make online shopping safer, not be a tool of revolution. Judged by the &quot;make shopping safer&quot; standard it does a pretty great job. Judged by the &quot;fight repressive regime and save the world&quot; standard, it still does a surprisingly good job - the NSA doesn&#x27;t seem to like it much at all - but it&#x27;s unrealistic to expect an internet protocol designed in the mid 90s to do that.",1420645955

A DNS request is a DNS request, and aside from a response being too big for UDP and having to switch to TCP, you should get nearly-identical performance.<p>The part, to me, that looks like a real performance issue is potentially having to double the minimum amount of queries to serve a website.  We couldn&#x27;t possibly switch directly to SRV records; there would have to be an overlap of browsers using both SRV and A records for backwards compatibility.<p>If we stick with that invariant, then we can say that the first-load cost of a page not using SRV records doubles in the worst case: websites that only have an A record.  Now we&#x27;re looking for a SRV record, not getting it, and falling back to an A record.  So, now, all of the normal websites who don&#x27;t give a crap about SRV records, won&#x27;t ever use them, pay a performance penalty.  A marginal one, sure. but it&#x27;s there.,<p>So, overall, their claim seems valid, even if low in severity.<p>I&#x27;d love to hear from someone that has the data, but I can count on one hand the number of times where a loss of IP connectivity has happened where I wish I had SRV records for load balancing.  It&#x27;s usually bad DNS records, or slow/bad DNS propagation, or web servers behind my load balancers went down, or a ton of other things.  Your point is still totally valid about being able to more easily load balance across multiple providers, datacenters, what have you... but I&#x27;m not convinced it&#x27;s as much of a problem as you make it out to be.",1420645845

Look at how quickly Google has given up its &#x27;no evil&#x27; mantra, for example, or how Bill Gates had to transform from 1980s geek hero to 1990s hated Bill Gates.

8851043,comment,8844023,8850436,0,0,lmkg,,,"Eh... somewhat.<p>I do think that it&#x27;s meaningful to describe a <i>program</i> as being imperative or declarative or object-oriented or functional or strongly-typed or whatever, and that determination can be separate from the language that the program was written in (up to a point). See also, &quot;writing COBOL in any language.&quot;<p>But just because those descriptions apply to programs, that doesn&#x27;t mean that they are inapplicable to languages. At the least, those languages can be described in terms what types of programs they <i>allow</i> and what types they <i>encourage</i>, and how strongly. What programs they allow is a question mostly of features, but what they encourage is more complicated question that often involves the culture and ecosystem as much as the syntax or standard library.<p>E.g., Haskell encourages functional, strongly-typed programs. It&#x27;s possible to write an imperative, weakly-typed program by using a lot of monads and passing data between modules as serialized strings. But that program is massively cutting against the grain, so to speak, so it&#x27;s still meaningful to describe Haskell as functional and strongly-typed. Common Lisp functions naturally fit together into a functional program, but it&#x27;s nowhere near as difficult or counter-intuitive to write an imperative program, so Common Lisp can lay better claim to being multi-paradigm.<p>I do think that programs are the primary things that are described as imperative or whatever. Languages are better-described by the programs they encourage rather than the features they have. For example, JavaScript and Ruby have all the features common to (dynamically-typed) functional languages (closures, lambdas, functions-as-values, etc), but that&#x27;s not the type of program that is easiest to write in either language. That&#x27;s why most people don&#x27;t describe JavaScript as a functional language, even though there are certainly functional programs written in it.",1420644992

It is <i>racist</i> and <i>wrong</i> to respond that way, but none of us are perfect, and these biases can be hard to suppress.

Other sites let you search on their listings which are acquired through manual import/export processes. Some of these sites also require dealerships to pay them money to be listed on them. MotoMiner has no entry barriers. Its automated processes to monitor/mine the web for vehicle classifieds are free and yield a more comprehensive dataset to search on.<p>Other listing sites will not let the buyer/visitor navigate to the original vehicle classified page on the auto dealership&#x27;s website.  They do this so they can capture the buyers information and resell it to the seller/dealer or make dealers subscribe to their services. This process frustrates both buyers and sellers. MotoMiner&#x27;s visitors are able to search on the data and navigate directly to the original page to which the vehicle was found. The process is more transparent and the buyer can deal directly with the seller.<p>Yes, there are over 100,000 car dealership websites. Some of them are inactive, some redirect, some sellers have multiple websites with the same cars. MotoMiner indexes data from all of them and we run de-dupe & cleaning processes on it.<p>MotoMiner&#x27;s objective is to help buyers find cars more efficiently. MotoMiner also helps the sellers (often car dealerships) by getting them more exposure for free. We index a handful of data points per page (we don&#x27;t scrape the page and reshow it as our own). These indexed data points are used so visitors can search on them and find the vehicle detail page they&#x27;d want to go to.<p>As to how we identify what websites, what pages to index,  how we extract data points... those are trade secrets.<p>Our business model is like other search engines. MotoMiner presents a new and improved way that buyers want to search for cars. We will allow for sellers to be able to promote their vehicles in an unobtrusive way. When you search Google, the first 1-3 results may be an Ad that is pertinent for what you searched on. MotoMiner can do the same. For instance, if you searched on a Ford F-150 near zip code 12345, a local Ford dealership may be paying to promote their vehicles and so their Ford F-150&#x27;s may show up in the first 1-3 results.<p>The &quot;About&quot; page on MotoMiner&#x27;s website may help shed light on what we are all about. <a href=""https://motominer.com/About"" rel=""nofollow"">https://motominer.com/About</a><p>Hope this helps.

The very least the pawnbroker should pay is the cost of whatever they&#x27;re out of pocket for, but really they ought to be facing criminal charges.

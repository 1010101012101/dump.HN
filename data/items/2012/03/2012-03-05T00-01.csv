Insecure by default. Microsoft used to be the laughing stock because the default install was vulnerable to exploits.

3664814,comment,3663727,3664418,2,0,toyg,,,"Exactly. There are some well-paying niches where a ""polyglot programmer"" will be required, e.g. C++/Python, Ruby/Javascript... knowing only part of the required combo will likely not get you the job or curtail your remuneration.<p>A career-minded person could just expand his core competencies in order to nail those niches. Not everyone enjoys hacking LISP in their spare time, but expanding your horizons is the right thing to do if you care about your job prospects. If you write for the embedded market at a low level, pick up something higher in the stack; if you only dabble in high-level languages, try looking under the hood; if you specialize in particular technologies (e.g. C#/.net), look at their complementary stuff (e.g. javascript, powershell, or even Java interop and VC++).<p>Also, ""learning a language"" could just be ""learn a big framework / toolset"". For example, if you know Python, you might want to pick up Django, or a GUI framework like Qt, even if they are outside the boundaries of what you need at work: they tend to have their own programming style and quirks, so they can be key technologies to bring you new opportunities. Java has boatloads of big frameworks, chances are that you don't know all of them. Ruby people tend to live all the time in their Rails ghetto, but there's a world of libraries outside that.

GitHub at least keeps it up most of the time. Who you really should be mad at are the Rails maintainers and the RoR community. I switched from Java to Ruby a few years back, and since day one, everyone using Rails has been slack on security. The reason is that they make things too easy to leave wide open. Don't believe me? Read the Rails official documentation for starting off. It is all about ease of use, not security. If you are new, you have no idea what you've really left open even when you just generate a scaffold as they show you to do. The main thing that Rails security has going for it is that the adoption of Rails is still relatively low, and because a newbie isn't likely to scale their app well, odds are you won't have an extremely popular, extremely performant Rails app that is just asking to be hacked that easily.",1330908425

These are my thoughts on this matter:<p>Yes, it is potentially worth a lot to businesses. But not by itself. Think of all the cool things a company could do with this information - those are the things you should be providing to the company. Otherwise you're limiting yourselves to businesses that both have the vision to see the potential AND have the available resources to implement it into their workflow.<p>If you aim for the marketing potential in identifying connectors/mavens, you should add a layer of services that help businesses to communicate effectively with those individuals, and track how the message spreads through the network.<p>If you aim for the customer service aspect, you should add a layer that helps connect your information with their CRM systems.<p>Or you could find strategic partners in those fields, and enable them to integrate your services in their existing product portfolio.",1330907957

Maybe you can create a private bounty program for them and provide some rules to abide by or even teach them how to do things correctly in an adult world.<p>Suspending their account immediately might actually be a good initial slap on the wrist for a teenager.

<i>/Edit</i><p>I think it would be a good public move for Github to reinstate Egor Homakov's account, @homakov.<p>Its fairly clear from the discussion here https://github.com/rails/rails/issues/5228 that Egor identified an issue and was making the argument that some kind of fix is needed. His intentions seem to be entirely good, and one of his mistakes was identifying himself while raising the issue at hand.<p>The other mistake, if you want to call it that, was to demonstrate the exploit <i>to the Rails community</i> with this commit, https://github.com/rails/rails/issues/5239.<p>The problem here is that since Rails is hosted on Github, many people are assuming this was an <i>attack on Github</i>.<p>It wasn't. If Rails was hosted somewhere else that was vulnerable in the same way, where that is a separate company or a privately-hosted git repo somewhere, the same commit from the future would have been possible. Whether or not those hypothetical hosting services would react in the same way is, of course, hypothetical.<p>But speaking about the real world, right now, its clear that Github is one of the most important companies in the world to programmers of all sorts. Even if a programmer doesn't host their projects on Github directly, there are all kinds of libraries and technologies that <i>do</i> host on Github that the programmer uses.<p>So simply banning Egor's account does absolutely nothing to make Github more secure. Instead, it tarnishes your otherwise excellent reputation and makes you more insecure by discouraging people from discussing security vulnerabilities that may affect your company via the technologies you use. Especially if those core technologies are <i>hosted</i> on your service.<p>And honestly, the public apology thing is getting a bit old. This is all well and good for letting the public know what you're doing to rectify a vulnerability, https://github.com/blog/1068-public-key-security-vulnerability-and-mitigation.

    its hard to believe that now, three years later, instead of one hundred beta testers, the company has over a hundred incredibly talented employees helping us realize that vision. and theyre building amazing things.

    in that time, ive worn a ton of hats: from product to engineering, from funding rounds to roadshows, from recruiting to evangelizing. but, after three years, i feel ive done all i can do and im moving on. dennis and i have been discussing timing for a while, and we decided that now, on this anniversary, it feels right to begin the transition. so this will be my last month working at foursquare. over the course of the next few weeks, im going to be taking a step back as my final projects near their release.

    ive always been here for the company and i always will be. i look quietly around the office every once in a while as the team works (not. creepy. at. all.) and i cant tell you how proud i am of everyone. weve brought together an incredibly special group  one thats going to go down in history  and theyre going to keep making us all proud.

    going forward, im going to continue to be connected to the company: im on the board, ill still be advising, and im obviously going to be the single most vocal user. but the spring is time for things that are new, and i realize that i have a desire to do something new as well. im not sure about my exact next steps, but ill probably get back to what i love most  being an entrepreneur, learning and building new things.

    three years ago, we took an idea and threw it into the world. im going to miss the crazy intensity that is foursquare, but am excited to see where it all goes from here.</code></pre>",1330905609

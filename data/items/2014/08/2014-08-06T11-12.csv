I didn&#x27;t respond to it because I thought the point was particularly debatable (in my mind, just quickly looking at that document was pretty damning to point 3...).<p>Methanol was used before, during and after prohibition, and it continues to be used today. Pretty much any decent reference will be very clear about denaturing ethanol with methanol (Wikipedia takes 5 words to wink at the fact, using &quot;methylated spirits&quot; as a synonym for denatured alcohol. One paragraph later it says &quot;The main additive has traditionally been 10% methanol&quot;).<p>Calling that particular fact &quot;historically dubious&quot; insinuates something about the other claims in the article, but I sort of think that the author (a &quot;professor of science journalism&quot;) went further than &quot;the googles&quot; in their attempts to gather information. I&#x27;m sure they read the medical examiner reports that they claim exist. I&#x27;m sure the reports are real.

And because the orbit forces it to slowly overtake the comet, it needs to slow down periodically to stay at 100km of it.<p>No, not quite. Remember, we&#x27;re talking about a three body problem here so any intuition from two body dynamics doesn&#x27;t really hold.<p>The spacecraft travels 100km closer to the sun than the comet, but that&#x27;s a very small fraction of the total distance. When you factor in the small acceleration from the comet body, we can no longer think of the orbit as being a slightly smaller orbit with a shorter period (and thus overtaking the comet).<p>My best understanding is that the triangular &quot;orbit&quot; is to measure the mass and gravitational properties of the comet in order to orbit as well as scientific goals.",1407326162

What&#x27;s important/exciting should be what we <i>do</i> about it, not how many messengers we have. We really have enough information by now to know what&#x27;s at stake. Meanwhile, if you remember a couple of months back, the NSA sent out an internal memo stating that they simply intend to &quot;winter the storm&quot;, and that seems to be what&#x27;s happening until now (besides a few more or less symbolical proposals from the gov&#x27;t).<p>> [...] it will encourage more whistleblowers.<p>Not convinced either. Again, we already know that deep changes would be needed. Also, whistleblowers, in this case, are obviously ready to die for their cause. There are not many people like that. And the World&#x27;s support for people like Snowden has been completely absent or at least appallingly weak. And then, there&#x27;s the fact that the NSA is currently in a huge lock-down process, which makes me think we won&#x27;t see another Snowden, when this is done.

We already have toy-ether in the testnet, but this is a whole different thing. Believe it or not, there&#x27;s a lot of people building things for ethereum. If you are serious about launching something on top of Ethereum, and like the idea, why not support the final stage of development? This is a crowdfunding campaign. That&#x27;s all.<p>Obviously there&#x27;s a bunch of other people just trying to get some ether for speculation.

8141925,comment,8140874,8140874,6,0,chipsy,,,"My analysis of Ethereum:<p>It&#x27;s economically limited. Ignoring the implementation, we could conservatively say that some interesting web applications are convertible into the &quot;Dapp&quot; form. Right now, these applications are presented as free to the user(free sign-up, free service) and the cost burden lies almost entirely on the service provider, while on Ethereum the user must pay some of the computation cost of their own transactions.<p>Why is this a problem? Surely everyone can have their personal devices mine and produce ether and then the cost of everyday use is hopefully negligible. But even if that were plausible, there&#x27;s enough of a power differential between personal devices and large server farms that the latter is going to have a huge cost advantage. From this advantage market forces will seek ways to leverage out a monopoly within the Ethereum platform - to enable spammers, extract tolls, mine for personal information, or any other conceivable mechanisms of earning a profit by crushing competition. It&#x27;s the position Bitcoin is facing now with the mining pool monopoly. There will be a market and it will have a price, but it won&#x27;t be a huge, global one, not if it&#x27;s an essentially centralized system doing centralized things underneath an inefficient blockchain layer.<p>In summary, currency design is hard. Proof-of-work mining basically favors capital pooling by letting the richest buy their work - although they may add some measure of anonymity, the resulting power dynamics are identical to those of gold. Changing the proof metric to another computationally-focused one only changes the cost basis, not the bottom line. As such I&#x27;m very sour on proof-of-work today as a decentralization tool. I would consider proof-of-stake or other metrics to be in a fundamentally different category, although they also need answers for the distribution problem.",1407324273

To get a customer that equation needs to yield a higher value than the next best thing. To win in a a market completely, you need to tick all three boxes. Better, cheaper, faster.<p>Uber focused on high quality early on, the limo market. They beat limos for price and convenience (the competition sucked) and matched the quality.  More expensive than taxis, but better quality (nicer car). As the network grew, &quot;convenience&quot; went up, fast pickup times. They expanded downmarket (lower price & quality) with uberXand to take on Taxis.<p>I think this ridesharing/carpooling, if it works well might find an unserved niche somewhere between Taxis and  public transport.<p>A next step might be something close to public transport. Basically minibuses running something similar to shuttles between hotels and airports. Most cities have these. They are possible because hotels can coordinate. That&#x27;s why they are more common between the hotel and the airport than the other way around. There are probably lots of other use cases that are just missing the coordination.",1407323182

For one it&#x27;s still pretty much vaporware, little has been released and there&#x27;s a ton of hype that puts style over substance. For example you&#x27;ll hear &#x27;turing complete&#x27; used 500 times in any piece about Ethereum, but speaking to core developers it turns out that this isn&#x27;t really significant at all.<p>Besides this there have been some doubts about the development and governance of Ethereum. Let&#x27;s be clear. Bitcoin is mostly developed by developers funded by the foundation which has a total budget of about $1.5m a year for 2013 and has been doing this for half a decade. Ethereum has already raised as much money as the BF spends in a decade on development, legal, lobbying, evangelism etc. In short, they&#x27;ve got way more money than they need.<p>And then there have been some complaints about how the team handled things, e.g. an investment round they tried to do earlier but failed. And how there&#x27;s no real reason to need such a large amount of expensive ethers for actual development purposes, particularly not a long time before actual development start.<p>Don&#x27;t get me wrong, not trying to hate on the team. But I can&#x27;t find a good reason why people buy ethers like they do. They&#x27;re supposed to be for development, not as an investment, and we really don&#x27;t need so many of them. It&#x27;s the equivalent of Google selling developer Google Glasses for $10k a piece, and regular joes buy 10 of em &#x27;just to hold as an investment, who knows it might take off.&#x27; It&#x27;s ridiculous. Only then it was a pre-order, and there&#x27;d be no way to start developing for it, the team behind it is talented but unproven, and in a classic hype scheme the price goes UP over time, not down, despite it being already overpriced and sold as an investment instead of as a dev-resource.",1407323043

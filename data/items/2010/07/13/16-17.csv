And I'm sure that a specific example was thought of.<p>To give one of several likely causes, CPU pipelines have grown much longer.  As a result it is more important to avoid stalls these days.  Naive code compiled with a modern compiler knows about the importance of this.  For instance the compiler will know it can avoid a stall in certain cases by making sure that a read from memory that happens soon after a write obeys something called store to load forwarding restrictions.  Doing that can mean extra code which would be slower on an old computer, but it is faster than a modern one.",1279040242

Large high-performance C-style projects are always struggling with the tension between the indirection that architects want to keep the system clean and the hardwired directness that the profiler says the system needs to be fast. ObjC didn't introduce this dilemma; function pointers did. It's so well known in C++ code that the MIT Click Modular Router even got distributed with a tool that automated de-virtualizing method calls.<p>In both C++ and ObjC, when dispatch gets scary, you write C code. The difference is that C++ pummels you about the head and shoulders for even considering writing straight C with naked pointers, while ObjC could care less.<p>I would rather avoid ObjC. I would rather build a large system out of any high-level language, from Scala to Ruby to Python to Lisp, and use an FFI to drop into C code. But I'd spend the rest of my career in ObjC without so much as a Bourne shell script to fall back on than I would willingly start another project in C++.",1279040071

Writing an initializer takes 3 lines of boilerplate, every time, plus the header declaration:<p><pre><code>  if ((self = [super init]) == nil)\n    return nil;\n\n  return self;\n</code></pre>\nThe language is obtuse, ridiculously verbose, frustrating to use, and downright paleolithic compared to modern deployed languages.

Lets say you have a Facebook game with a Valentine's Day promotion and you want to see whether people who sent their bonnie lass a cow to show their affection are better or worse customers two months later.

But once that wears off you are left with Objective-C, a vestigial language that isn't suited for a majority of application development.<p>Here are some reasons I think Objective-C needs to be retired:<p>- Header Files: These are archaic and require you to repeat code unnecessarily. Compiler's shouldn't require humans to do something that computers are better at.<p>- No Automatic Garbage Collection: In ObjC 2.0 we have this, but not on the iPhone. Unless you are making a high performance game, there is no reason the phone can't handle Automatic GC.<p>- No NSDictionary/NSArray literals: [[NSDictionary alloc] initWithObjectsAndKeys:@""value"", @""key"", @""value2"", @""key2"", nil]; // Enough said<p>- No regex: You kind of get regex's in 3.2+, but they are very limited and require around 3-4 lines of setup to get anything done.<p>- Xcode: You are pretty much required to use Xcode and I don't like Xcode. Even if you use the ""xcodebuild"" CLI, you still have to create the project through Xcode.<p>- Closures: I guess we will be able to use these soon, but it is going to take awhile for all the API's to get updated to accommodate them.<p>- No dynamic variables: It's handy to be able to shove data into objects sometimes. It's a hack, but as long as you treat it as such you can save a lot of needless code. (You can do this via the ObjC runtime, but it's messy)<p>- Unit Testing: It barely exists and is difficult to use.<p>- No namespacing: ObjC handles namespaces by prefixing class names.

SF was driving me insane.<p>But then I moved back to NYC from San Francisco and realized that art, music and literature is dying out everywhere in the USA. In New York, there's a lot more stuff like ping-pong clubs and designer boutiques and bike paths... but there certainly aren't as many interesting art, literary or music things happening as there were in the 1990s.<p>San Francisco was never really an artistic or intellectual center, it's always just been kind of a weird place.<p>I might be the only person on this forum who moved to SF to go skateboarding, rather than start a tech startup.<p>If you move to SF hoping it will be a cultural mecca you will be disappointed. But if you go with the flow, you might find something you like.I don't like burning man, either. But there's other stuff to do. I have never been happier than when I was skating or riding my bike around the city, or just goofing off. Why do you think there are so many bums there? Why do you think the beats moved there? It's a great city in which to ""bum around."" It's kind of bad for almost anything else. I view my time spent there as an extended vacation.",1279036920

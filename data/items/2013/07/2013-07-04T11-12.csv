Along with a further shift in how people communicate towards easily moniterable technology, that is the crux of the matter.<p>It was one thing to have secret societies intent on capturing everything in the 60s, when technology limited the scope of the operation. It&#x27;s another thing when that intention is not readjusted to the societal and technical realities of 50 years later.<p>That&#x27;s why it seems like such a sudden, surprising change in policy to some who haven&#x27;t kept up with the technical possibilities for surveillance, while others realize it&#x27;s been a slow change going on for decades now.<p>And of course, for the past decades some of us have been trying to point out the technical possibilities to everyone who would listen, only to get told that just because it&#x27;s possible doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;s being done -- we&#x27;re not surprised by Snowden&#x27;s leaks, but certainly vindicated.",1372938956

Therefore the Nazi&#x27;s are on topic. The problem with saying &quot;There is a big difference between the US government and Nazis&quot; is that when we think of the Nazis we think of everything that they did at the end of their reign, after they had a death grip on Germany. But the history of the Nazi Party doesn&#x27;t begin in the late 30s. The groundwork began before 1920.<p>Indeed, World War II is one of the most focused upon subjects in the study of history because it is a very important subject. If we knee-jerkedly banish all discussion of the Nazis until we are dealing with a government that is in fact like the Nazi party of the late 30s, then it&#x27;s far too late. I don&#x27;t think that anybody is saying that government spying on everyone is akin to the worst actions of the Nazis, but it is the sort of consolidation of power that could, in part lead to similar authoritarian regimes in the future.<p>On the other hand, I&#x27;m not signing onto the &quot;sheeple&quot; comment. I&#x27;m just pointing out that discussion of the Nazis should not be off limits for this topic in general.<p>[edited for clarity, and added the caveat at the end.]",1372938663

Taking both user groups into consideration and weighing them equally assumes that they have the same bearing on the usage of your product. Once it reaches mass market, the tinkerers (occasionally referred to as the early adopters or evangelists) are no longer the largest nor the most profitable segment of your user-base.<p>Therefore, you can theoretically afford to disregard them--however, in practice, this has implications that can prove disastrous. For instance, they could seek out an alternative and start the disruptive cycle all over again, increasing its appeal and reducing yours, which propagates and ultimately ruins your perception, though this can probably be avoided.",1372938565

That&#x27;s not the same as the entire organization or even its leadership holding that position.</i><p>I agree that this is not something to be outraged about, but it is something to be watchful of and to be called out - government agencies should not refer to peaceful or even violent protesters as terrorists, and our laws should not distinguish between terrorists and other suspects in terms of the rights we give them. In this particular case I agree we need more evidence to say anything meaningful, but there are plenty of examples of misuse of powers given to our states to deal with terrorists for other purposes.<p><i>Context matters a lot, and so do primary sources. This sort of political free-association that you seem to enjoy quickly ends up in conspiracy-theory territory because it&#x27;s not falsifiable. </i><p>That is mostly my objection to the use of the label terrorist - the meaning of the term has been stretched to encompass so many acts (from giving money, to riots, to bombing a market), and the judgement calls required to choose between freedom-fighter and terrorist are so subjective, that use of the term limits the horizons of any debate to a narrow exchange of slogans. It is similar to the epithet traitor when applied to Edward Snowden. It&#x27;s simply a way to shut down debate without further thought, and classify others as in a group you could never parley with or understand.<p>What&#x27;s interesting about both the Snowden case and terrorism when it comes to the US is that in both cases the government sees some acts as good, and others as bad a priori, when in character they are exactly the same. This administration leaks classified secrets all the time, but those are good leaks, whereas Snowden&#x27;s leaks to journalists are bad leaks. Obama stood in the former jail cell of a terrorist at the weekend and contemplated freedom and the terrorist&#x27;s struggle to end Apartheid.<p>These issues are complex and shouldn&#x27;t be reduced to sound-bites or slogans, and the label of terrorist is particularly dangerous in the west at present as it has been used to justify ignoring our laws on human rights, privacy, and justice for whole swathes of people. As soon as you are associated (even a few degrees removed) from activity deemed terrorist, your rights no longer exist. That&#x27;s extremely dangerous.",1372937421

After graduation it didn&#x27;t change much, except I started to earn money.<p>The only way I aware about to change the situation is just find something interesting and dedicate yourself to it. Just forget about people around for a while, concentrate only on a few (close family members), after some time people come to you because you become more knowledgeable and have deeper view of the world then ordinary people.",1372935872

5990067,comment,5989368,5989869,1,0,Metatron,,,"Of course there&#x27;s a moral grey zone when selling a used car. We&#x27;re talking about the people who craft something being snubbed for the profit of a private individual. When someone buys a used car that means a new car isn&#x27;t sold. The car industry and any industry that has used sales, has to then push up the price of new products to counter the loss of sales from the used market, punishing customers. This is BAD, no matter what way you look at it.<p>Money is meant to be a mechanism that enables the trading of labour. I put in X effort, I am recompensed with Y money. I can then use Y money myself to by things that I want. To then resell something I&#x27;ve worked for and legitimately purchased is me making money out of nothing, or rather from the labour a game developer has put in. That right there is the moral greyzone. You have a gut feeling that you should have the right to resell any of your possessions, and perhaps you&#x27;re right, but you have to accept the damage you do to an industry, and to the other purchasers of products and services like yourself, that is done when you perpetuate a second-hand market.<p>To say you have a right to resell, and the added inference that &#x27;more money for myself is good&#x27; that comes along with that is a very narrow-minded and one-sided argument. If you think about the larger picture and the consequences of your actions then this all becomes a very different proposition. But as the owner of a used games marketplace I don&#x27;t expect you to see the selfless side.",1372935717

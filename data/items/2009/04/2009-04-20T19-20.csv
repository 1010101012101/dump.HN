My first project was one I worked on since I was 16 and sold it when I was 24. Granted, it wasn't a startup but a software product, it was to me a combination of high school, college and graduate school. When I sold it and signed the ridiculous non-compete papers, I had NOTHING else to work on. Even the much taunted liberal arts PhDs get to keep their titles; I kept nothing. (sure, I was happy to sell it by then, because I was burned out, but it might have been better to delay the negotiations until I was in a better emotional and financial state and was optimistic about the future.)<p>I know this is tangential to the topic at hand, but had to air my grievances to warn someone else who might be tying their startups with their personal identities.",1240257347

Fears that 'I'll be left behind if I don't take xxxxx because everyone else is' are overblown, and balanced by fears of 'I'm only productive because I take cocaine, maybe I actually suck' or whatever.<p>I've always liked recreational drugs, and a little boost at a critical moment can enhance work; but since one's body quickly develops a tolerance it's not compatible with any long-term work consumption (as many have found to their cost). Many (most?) articles about drugs posit some kind of linear relationship between the input and output, whereas the reality is nonlinear dynamic system with a complex feedback loop.<p>Thus, I love a big mug of coffee every morning, but it's not so much that it makes me super-productive as I get a bit slow and crabby on the days when I skip my coffee. It doesn't give me any edge over a non-coffee drinker. On the other hand I don't get a caffeine hangover or crash, which would be a risk with a more potent drug if I took it regularly.<p>Anyway...the article assumes there's only one kind of enhancement. A good scientist or engineer is just as likely to have a brekthrough idea while decompressing on the weekend with a beer or a fattie, as when sitting at their work station. Same reason many people get their best ideas while walking, soaking in the tub, or whatever.",1240256902

Personally, I've heard none.<p>Now, I'm not going to sit here and tell you that I still work 20 hours a day, because I don't. Last summer I was close, though. I stopped sacrificing my health at the beginning of this year when I began going to the gym every day again and stopped smoking a pack a day. Now that spring is upon us, I'm even beginning to remember a time when ""woman"" was a word in my vernacular.<p>The reason you see these types of articles and the reason you will continue to is because for those of us who have no other jobs, our startups are our lives. I could work for Big Co. and go home at the end of the day not at all worrying about whether or not they will be there tomorrow. The company would pay me X to perform Y and that would be exactly what I'd perform (if I wanted a promotion, maybe Y+1).<p>At TicketStumbler, I am not merely a cog. If I don't write code for that new feature or fix that bug or setup that new server, <i>nobody else is going to</i>.  This means that not only do I constantly have <i>a lot</i> to do, but it all has pretty much the same priority: <i>done yesterday</i>. And if I decide to take a few days off instead of doing one of those things? I get the pleasure of feeling guilty about it the entire time.<p>So it basically boils down to: at an early-stage startup you have the pleasure of controlling your destiny and being your own boss; for those of us who cannot stomach traditional employment, we feel as if we actually have a <i>soul</i>. The downside? Well, you live in a constant and unrelenting state of stress and obligation. The effects of that state differ from person to person, but alienations/estrangement from family and friends and unwillingness to prioritize anything other than the company are common ones.",1240256178

You already had that knowledge and just didn't apply it, for one reason or another.<p>You <i>know</i> when something is cool in your chosen field(s). If you're a geek, that means when you first encountered a modem, IP, Linux or Google, depending on your age. As Pirsig - or rather, his muse - says in 'Zen & the art of motorcycle maintenance': Quality is what you like. Everyone has in-depth knowledge of <i>something</i>, even stupid people; so when the 'woah, <i>cool</i>' reaction takes place it's just a matter of relating it back to your area of knowledge and the significance thereof (obviously, if your specialty is knitting, carbon-fiber knitting needles probably won't make the front page...but then, there are a lot of knitters out there....what do I know?).<p>You can, and do, sense the potential easily. It's the 10% inspiration. The reason most people, myself included, don't capitalize on things like this is because they are unable or unwilling to commit the money or time. Kinda like romance, you know pretty fast whether you'd like to sleep with someone, but committing to seeing them daily requires a decision, and many of us are nervous of risking the money or time involved; indeed, nervous in proportion to our ability to be carried away on a wave on enthusiasm. In this case, I recommend setting a limit of time and/or money to invest, and a cutoff date by which you'll give up if it turns out to suck.<p>Yes, amateur programmers will soon run up against the limits of their knowledge; a few will go pro, others will give up. But the most important outcome will be from non-programmers and non-designers coming up with paradigm-busting ideas, which will look like crap at first but turn out to be important later.",1240254606

571197,comment,571075,571102,0,0,tdavis,,,"I would argue the exact opposite. Because the amount of information you can transmit is so limited, it makes it far easier <i>not</i> to think twice. Think about it: writing a blog post is, for most people, an activity which requires a good deal of thought, revision, and editing. And why shouldn't it -- you can write and include anything you want.<p>Compare that to Twitter: how long does it take to think of 140 characters to spew into a tiny box? Not very long. And since it is so easy, it can be done 20 times per day! And since there are so many ""posts"", you don't really have to care about the <i>quality</i> of those posts individually. You can see this on a lot of blogs, too -- once-poignant bloggers set out to write a post per day and suddenly it becomes obvious they are grasping for topics, jumping sharks, and simply putting stuff out there that is of low quality.<p>There are two ends to the writing spectrum, and on either end are the essayists and the, uh, twitter-ists. The essayists don't release very often, but when they do it is close to a foregone conclusion that the material will be worth reading. The twitterists release a dozen times per day and while they will occasionally, perhaps merely by statistical probability, release something worth reading, it is close to a foregone conclusion that the material will <i>not</i> be worth reading.<p>Now we get to the ""masses"" part, and why Twitter will take off. Answer this question:<p>The majority of people are: (a) essayists, (b) twitterists<p>The answer is quite obvious. Tweeting requires neither skill nor forethought which are things that most people either do not possess or do not exercise very often.",1240254380

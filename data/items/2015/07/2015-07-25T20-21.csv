(Aside: holy steaming pile of crap, Twitter search really sucks.)<p>YC is generally looking for really solid teams -- people that know eachother well, get along well, have a history together, hopefully have been through difficult times together. Because a startup can be extraordinarily difficult and the odds of a home-run success will fall quite a lot if cofounders can&#x27;t weather the challenges.<p>If you happen to be the rare true one-man-team, then by all means, apply anyway. (Or, apply even if you&#x27;re not sure if you are; what do you have to lose?)<p>But ... maybe YC isn&#x27;t the right thing for you anyway. There are a lot of different ways to start and run a business, and the startup model has some distinct disadvantages, not least of which is that it&#x27;s difficult to spend much time away from the startup up until it has grown to its full size. Do you really want to spend the next, say, 10 years of your life dealing almost exclusively with growing a business? Because I get the sense that that&#x27;s what investors are looking for.<p>Contrast this with a regular plain ol&#x27; lifestyle business. You gather a small amount of capital together, put together an early prototype product, find your customers, get the business to start making ends meet, pay off debt, and then go visit a beach somewhere in the world and have a beer and stare at the waves and think about how to grow the business a little bit more so that you can afford to stay at a nicer beach.",1437857777

9948965,comment,9947146,9947476,0,0,chestnut-tree,,,"I was talking in general about Open Source and design not about Plasma. But since you ask, here are some small things I noticed in the video<p>- Mismatched visual styles: when you tap the phone icon, you get a bar of three icons. Two are simple line icons (History and Contacts), the third is a detailed picture of a keyboard to denote keypad. A minor thing and easily fixed.<p>- Interface inconsistencies: I noticed that a large red X is used for closing a screen (which I like over the sometimes unclear Back button behaviour you get in Android).  But at 3:16 in the video the Wallpaper screen has a &#x27;close&#x27; button (with X) and below that in the tab bar is the larger red X for closing too. So you have two close functions on the same screen. You see the same duplication on the date and Time screen at 3:41. By the way, I think the way Windows Phone lets you change date and time is much nicer. It&#x27;s a similar spinner approach to Plasma but less cluttered. Here&#x27;s a video of it in action: <a href=""https://youtu.be/kIsWgCX7qtE?t=54s"" rel=""nofollow"">https://youtu.be/kIsWgCX7qtE?t=54s</a><p>Also, the commands &#x27;close&#x27;, &#x27;cancel&#x27; and &#x27;delete&#x27; all tend to use the same X icon in many UIs so if there is no label for X, then it&#x27;s meaning (and behaviour) should be consistent across the OS.<p>- Weather app: there is a &#x27;hamburger&#x27; menu on the left and another slimmer hamburger menu on the right. They feel too similar visually. Presumably, the right-hand menu is equivalent to the overflow menu you find on Android. But are two menus needed here? Could they not all sit in one menu?<p>Obviously, this is a beta and these are relatively minor points. I can see some influence from Android, which is fine - there&#x27;s no doubt that Google, Microsoft and Apple all study and are influenced by each others work. I just hope the OS stands up well as a unique UI rather than just a clone of bits from other OSes.<p>Overall, it looks quite polished for a version 1.0 and I hope the project succeeds. I would love to see an open source project take the lead in design/UX over existing projects.",1437857634

Multiple threads per core to make use of the dual vector units introduced in Haswell<p>2. SIMD-like thinking to remap tasks into the 8-way and soon to be 16-way vector units<p>3. Running multiple threads across multiple cores<p>4. Micromanaging the L1 cache and treating the AVX/SSE registers as L0 cache<p>Where the CPU prevails is for fundamentally serial algorithms that cannot be mapped into a SIMD implementation.

His writing is incoherent though.

PP is intended to deal with uncertainty and risk in cases where the absence of evidence and the incompleteness of scientific knowledge carries profound implications and in the presence of risks of &quot;black swans&quot;, unforeseen and unforeseable events of extreme consequence. We formalize PP, placing it within the statistical and probabilistic structure of ruin problems, in which a system is at risk of total failure, and in place of risk we use a formal fragility based approach. We make a central distinction between 1) thin and fat tails, 2) Local and systemic risks and place PP in the joint Fat Tails and systemic cases. We discuss the implications for GMOs (compared to Nuclear energy) and show that GMOs represent a public risk of global harm (while harm from nuclear energy is comparatively limited and better characterized). PP should be used to prescribe severe limits on GMOs.<p>Leaves little doubt.

Then you prove some things about the model. Finally, you claim that the things you&#x27;ve proved about the model are also true about the real world. It doesn&#x27;t matter how rigorous the mathematical steps in the middle are, the strength of this kind of argument is determined by the first step: how strong is the analogy between the mathematical system and real life?<p>In physics, we can build models where the analogy is very strong: when we try out new situations in both the model and in real life, we get the same answer in both. In (macro-)economics, we typically do something weaker, where we start with a set of models determined by intuition, and then choose the one that gives results most similar to real life in the situations we&#x27;ve already seen. Prediction of future events is really difficult.<p>It seems like the approach in Taleb&#x27;s paper is even weaker. We choose a model based on pure analogy, explicitly disclaim the usefulness of evidence (&quot;While evidentiary approaches are often considered to reflect
adherence to the scientific method in its purest form, it is apparent that these approaches do not apply to ruin problems&quot;), and then attack anyone who says that we&#x27;ve done something other than prove a mathematical theorem about the real world.<p>It&#x27;s too bad, because underneath all of the &quot;mathiness&quot; is one of the strongest arguments against GMOs that I&#x27;ve heard (and I say that as a GMO-eater).

    A: We do not know, we are not lawyers so we are not qualified to answer this. Also we have never read patents to implement any part of FFmpeg, so even if we were qualified we could not answer it as we do not know what is patented. Furthermore the sheer number of software patents makes it impossible to read them all so no one (lawyer or not) could answer such a question with a definite no, those who do lie. What we do know is that various standards FFmpeg supports contain vague hints that any conforming implementation might be subject to some patent rights in some jurisdictions

To quote Colin Powell, former US Secretary of State regarding the possible invasion of Iraq:

I would argue that I have a duty of care to those children and their parents that is AT LEAST equal to my duty of care towards my own children.<p>A better analogy might be that of a school. Maybe the kids don&#x27;t want to be there, maybe their parents don&#x27;t want them in that school either, but once the children are there with the teachers &#x27;in loco parentis&#x27;, surely it is unacceptable for teachers in that school to take actions that make it safer for the teachers by making it less safe for the children?

It&#x27;s been several years since I&#x27;ve looked at it but you could find the documentation and XML schema files online from the IRS that companies like Intuit and others use to transmit their e-filings.<p>From what I recall the XML corresponded one to one with the paper forms. If you think about how the paper forms work it&#x27;s pretty straight forward. You go top to bottom entering data and making calculations. Sometimes there are rules (if this line is less than X, goto Y) that you would have to write somehow.<p>As to how they store it I can only speculate. I imagine they&#x27;re stored as blobs by return/form. I doubt they would be stored in some denormalized form as it seems unnecessary and difficult. They don&#x27;t need to query across all people&#x27;s returns at once. They&#x27;re probably batch processed return by return.",1437854781

9948798,comment,9946527,9948366,0,0,pron,,,"FYI, I had taken &quot;every opportunity to danger-danger-dragons-be-there&quot; Scala — on record — years before I even dreamed of the database company that would one day have an open-source project which would end up competing with Akka (I&#x27;m talking 2009/10, while Quasar was first conceived in mid 2013).<p>It was after leading an attempt to adopt Scala at a large organization, which failed because of what I saw as Scala&#x27;s bait-and-switch marketing: it presented itself as &quot;a better Java&quot; while it really was (and is) a strict-Haskell-with-OOP-and-macros-and-more. We needed a car and got a helicopter. While some would consider a helicopter superior to a car, I think everyone would agree it imposes a completely different set of tradeoffs. So yeah, for a good while I was telling people, listen, it&#x27;s a helicopter, so make sure a helicopter is what you want (the Scala community’s response was, what is this FUD? Can’t you see it&#x27;s got wheels?! You can drive it on the ground if you want; you don’t <i>have</i> to take off! To which I responded, but you still can’t take it to a car garage for maintenance, to which their response was, you’re a stupid biased troll!). I don&#x27;t remember when was the last time I participated in a Scala thread, but that community doesn’t forget. So if I&#x27;m damned if I don&#x27;t, I might as well do:<p>Spark is a good example for a project that would have been better off using Kotlin. They wouldn&#x27;t have missed any Scala features, would have had better build times, better IDE support and better Java interop (of course, Kotlin wasn’t mature enough to even be considered when that project started). In fact, using Kotlin would have saved them writing 95% of that style-guide[1], which reads like instructions on how to drive a helicopter on the ground without accidentally taking off (Perhaps ironically, that style guide drew derision from the Scala community, who said, you&#x27;re in a helicopter for fuck&#x27;s sake! Why won&#x27;t you take off?!)<p>[1]: No implicits, no multiple argument lists, no Try, no infix notation, no non-math operators, no recursion, no being-fancy-with-monads, no Scala concurrent collections, no Scala collections, no for loops. They don&#x27;t mention dynamics and structural types, but I think it goes without saying that they&#x27;re off-limits, too.",1437854496

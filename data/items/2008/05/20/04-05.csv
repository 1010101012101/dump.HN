194742,comment,194334,194490,0,0,Prrometheus,,,"Atlanta has some very nice places. Little Five Points, Virginia Highlands, and West End all have lots of character. I had a friend who was a trapeze hobbyist stay at a cheap and huge repurposed warehouse (I wouldn't quite say ""refurbished"") on the west side. She had her trapeze rope strung up in a cavernous main room with brick walls decorated with her friends' art. She had bitchin' parties at which she would get a little drunk and perform (not the smartest idea, but entertaining).<p>Sure, you have to drive places in Atlanta. We just had more people crash at our place after going out, or we would crash at theirs. The music scene is healthy, if you care about that sort of thing. People are friendly. And I paid $340/month in rent in 2005 (that is not a typo).<p>The food is great. I have yet to experience anything quite like it outside of New York, and NY can't match the prices. The Vortex serves the best burgers this side of the grave, and Highland Bakery has a shrimp and grits with a spicy cheddar sauce that cannot be described in any earthly tongue.<p>Add in a very international flavor, 2 of the 10 gayest counties in America (Sorry to stereotype, but any city without a gay population probably sucks. They sense backwards boring closed-minded people and stay away.), and you have one cool city.<p>I can't speak for Atlanta's start-up scene, but gawd, what a city. I hear Austin is better, but Atlanta is like a mini-Austin from what I can tell.",1211259437

I'm sure there's something semi-rare or different that you're interested in that isn't quite main-stream.<p>If it's the second, then that depends entirely on the market.",1211259309

I mean, I've ordered shoes there 4 times, and I've probably got a record of something like 6 returns total and 2 shoes purchased. They had to eat a ton on that.<p>I don't really see their ratio being high enough. I'm rooting for them, but I really feel like any day their prices are going to go up to MSRP and they're going straight out of business.<p>And I'd love to know what % of people take them up on the $1k.",1211258856

Ethics and morality are human constructs and inefficient ones at that. The question isn't ""Did I succeed at X by cheating/being unethical?"" its ""Did I succeed at X?""

Surely then no one is going to lend them any money.<p>I don't think other countries aren't asking for debts to be repaid. Then it's just the creditor of the banks which are asking for their money. Presumably the savers want to take their money out. So it's a run on all the banks of the country. But since they already nationalized the banks, surely they just have to print more currency. The currency takes a hit and it feels like Russia in the 80s, but it's probably still better than other outcomes.",1223463515

In general, you can't publicly solicit the sale of securities on the internet without having to deal with the SEC. If you want to talk you can email me at thomaspaine at gmail dot com.",1223463395

326460,comment,325775,325775,0,0,yters,,,"I think it is necessary in some cases to work extraordinarily hard, or perhaps even over a long period of time.  But that in itself shouldn't really be a criteria for anything, IMHO, b/c it can lead to tunnel vision.  At the very least, I keep seeing this mistake in my own approach to things.<p>Another thing I've noticed is that it also matters how much I like whatever it is I'm working on.  If I like it a lot, I will naturally remember thing about it well, have better insight, and learn more about it.  However, I may also be less productive because of this, i.e. going off on tangents.",1223461326

First he flatters the boy because that's such a genius question (really? things collide all the time - it's sort of an obvious question). Then he says that his grad school buddy once calculated that if you enter a particular orbit near enough to two colliding black holes, YOU TRAVEL BACKWARDS IN TIME!!!1111one<p>I swear, if a religious fanatic talked this way, people would laugh at him. But when you get enough ""science boosters"" together with people that have Scientific Authority, they can say all sorts of crazy shit and it's OK because Your Intuition Is Wrong.  (You can't see the emperor's clothes because your fashion intuition is just wrong, so shut your stupid classicist, Newtonian mouth.)<p>My local theater, the Paramount, is bringing Brian Greene to talk about his ""mysterious universe"" and all that string theory crap.  It's like.. this stuff is basically fringe theoretical... I'm almost loathe to call it physics, because it's just mathematical masturbation.  And most working physicists shake their heads at it, and even prominent theorists like Lee Smolin have come out and outright called it a sham.  But Dr. Greene and collaborators still get to go around the pop science circuit, making fantastical Nova specials about 11 dimensional nonsense, and basically corrupting the scientific sensibilities of the public.<p>My dad is an exceptionally bright physicist, and he is actively working to debunk most of modern cosmology.  He's not the only one; folks like Halton Arp (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halton_Arp"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halton_Arp</a>), who are skilled scientists in their own right, have been trying to call out the emperor's clothes for a long time.  There's actually a hilarious introduction in one of Halton Arp's books where he traces ~70 years of groupthink and group delusion in astrophysics, where overnight, some crazy ass theories fell out of favor as new ones suddenly took root, and everyone sort of didn't talk about the fact that what they believed the previous year was completely insane.  You could almost see a Monty Python sketch of this stuff, but sadly it's real. (Most of this theoretical churn was centered around the early work of Hubble, and people trying to figure just what the hell quasars are.)<p>Don't misunderstand me - it's fine and necessary to be wrong.  It's just not fine to waste the public's (already limited) science attention span on stuff that is just pure conjecture. And it's doubly bad to poison the minds of generations of future scientists with all this nonsense.  Cosmology is basically unhinged and it will eat itself.<p>I'll change my mind when they bring me a working warp nacelle. Until then, I'll be in my bunk... working to make lots of money in software, so I can personally fund fundamental physics research into magnetism.",1338436606

Because Google links back to the source of the data; these companies (mostly) do not.<p>While I accept that Craigslist has solid network effects going for it that make it hard to compete even with better UI, I don't think you get to go whining to the tech press about the fact that there are natural barriers to entry in your market.

You trade off between certainty and time by setting the initial confidence values.<p>For instance, if you're testing A, B, and C; you can start off with success/total values of 1/1 for each or 100/100 (for extreme values). If you start off with 1/1, a single hit or a single miss will swing the algorithm quickly and heavily in that particular direction; e.g. 1 miss for C results in 1/2, and brings its success rate down from 100% to 50% immediately, giving instant precedence to A and B. Whereas if you used 100/100 to start, a single miss for C would only bring it down to 100/101, letting the algorithm take much longer to ""settle,"" but with far more confidence.<p>The trick is in picking a number that suites your needs, e.g. for expensive traffic sources (AdWords) pick smaller numbers to minimize the cost of the experiment and for cheaper, more often sources use larger numbers because you can afford the extra time to be sure.",1338434396

The normal open sourcing process takes about 3-7 days.  If he really wanted certainty about releasing it as open source, he could have gone through that process and been done with it.<p>The process he is talking about is the process of Google granting ownership of various IP rights that google would normally own, to the employee.
For various reasons (ethics, patents, copyright, etc) this is more complicated, and takes longer.  Google is one of the few large companies that even lets you do this, AFAIK.
The humorous part of all this is that the page describing the process, states quite clearly it will take about 2 months to make a decision.  So it's not like the 2 month wait was unexpected, either, and phrasing it like he does implies that there was some amount of uncertainty in the time period where he was being strung along, which is simply not the case.",1338434059

For whatever reason I'm a little tired of too pretty sites related to JavaScript or other client side development. I think the reason for this is because I get the impression that the contributors emphasize trivial features and care more about artificial things, like a really opinionated interface but not a lot of innovation in performance.<p>It's like the bike shed concept. Anyone can paint a bike shed, but it takes real  skill and hard work to build a decent one. It's great to have a nice coat of paint, but the accomplishment wasn't picking the color. That's how I feel about ember.js's website, and the website for all these other client side things with fancy buttons, large web fonts and gratuitous use of space.

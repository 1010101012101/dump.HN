Because cabbies almost never get repeat customers, and because cabs are selected based on location not reputation or quality, cabbies have no incentive to provide good, safe service.

Great if you need to quickly make a change here or there<p>I don't think this is really a problem. Although dynamic typing vs strong typing advantages/disadvantages are a whole 'nother argument, the reason you might choose (say) Python over Clojure for a web app is the ecosystem (libraries, frameworks, deployment), performance (is this a concern for your design?), the syntax (do you like it?) and tools support (IDE's, etc.).<p>> Obviously you can bring all functionality that the web demands to Go. A jit compiler might help, maybe some loose typing, a few other widgets ... and then, guess what? You turned Go into PHP.<p>You could say the same about Ruby or Python.

The reason we accept higher prices is to avoid the catastrophic costs that could result if there was no regulation forcing taxis to maintain their vehicles, carry insurance, accept all passengers, etc.  Licensing forces a minimum level of insurance on taxi providers to guarantee that injured passengers are properly cared for in the event of an accident involving the taxi provider.

The passenger may not have any opportunity to investigate the taxi provider ahead of time, or to choose their taxi (i.e.,at  airports or hotels), so regulation is placed on taxi providers for the protection of passengers.<p>Car service: picks up a passenger by virtue of a prior arrangement.

I also recognize you may have the better reading of the article than me.<p>But I think there is a form of driving that is important in conversations generally.<p>If you ask me ""what is it?""  That's an invitation for me to drive you around a bit within certain limits.  How I choose to answer that is a form of driving.  If you ask me who needs it, I get to give you a brief tour of the market, the problems and what we are solving.<p>In essence there is a difference to reacting to questions and seeing the questions as an invitation to act.  I guess what I am getting at is that if the focus is on impressing the other individual that leads to reacting.  If the focus is on showing you something cool, that leads to the action I am talking about.",1341889369

There were many accidents involving unlicensed drivers of unmaintained cabs.  The medallion system was introduced to improve the safety of taxis by imposing minimum capital requirements, i.e., the cost of purchasing/renewing the medallion, and ongoing compliance requirements (insurance, vehicle maintainence, etc.).<p>Uber has not negated the underlying justification for the medallion system.  All it has done is to take all of the risks that taxi companies normally accept and push it on to the drivers and passengers.  Uber's disruptive edge is essentially its exploitation of its customers/service providers.<p>When your business is based around exploiting the financial naivete of others, you have to know that you will only enjoy that advantage for a limited window.",1341889254

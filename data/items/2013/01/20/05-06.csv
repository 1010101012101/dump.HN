5086157,comment,5084401,5085473,6,0,dchichkov,,,">> And in the meantime there has been very little commentary over the major (not only, but major) cause of this (untreated depression), presumably because that doesn't play into the agenda. Likewise there is little discussion on ways to amend CFAA to make it better-aligned with what we intuitively feel would be appropriate (because in the hacktivist mold the only good change would be to repeal CFAA entirely). Feel free to say I'm seeing it wrong, but I don't think I am.<p>Actually it has been discussed. As per his father:<p>""""""\nBob Swartz also dismissed the notion that his son had a depressive personality.<p>""He had never been diagnosed as having depression; he was never on medication for having depression,"" Swartz said.<p>Aaron Swartz's mother had been hospitalized in December 2011 after having a bowel obstruction and going into septic shock, Bob Swartz said. She spent several weeks in a coma, four months in intensive care, and two more months in the hospital.<p>""So the notion, the narrative that people are going to say -- is that hes somebody who just has depression -- is just wrong. Youd be depressed too if you were under a 13-count federal indictment and you go see your mother, whos in a coma.""",1358661466

It's not done too hard (and I can't find an example of it now).  I've seen other ""first party"" examples of upsell where you are going for one product and add another product from the same vendor.<p>I've also seen lots of horrible malware, trash, etc.  That's almost always what you see with PPI.<p>I think PPI is like banner ads were pre-Google.  What we need is the ""AdSense of PPI"" to deliver really contextually relevant/well targeted PPI to users.  The problem is I suspect this is really hard -- offering a $1-2 payout to put a crappy toolbar is nearly the optimum for any mass market piece of software.  But, if you had more targeted software (say, an awesome reverse engineering tool), there would probably be related tools you could promote at the same time which would be win/win.<p>The irony is you're more likely to see this as a third-party service, since individual volumes on tools with niche userbases are really low, unless a publisher has a bunch of complementary products in-house.  There's nothing specific enough for a Java JRE downloader to win out over a shitty toolbar.  There isn't enough volume for a decompiler to pay someone in-house to go out and negotiate a deal with a fuzzer or something, so you either do nothing, or run shitty toolbars, or hope for a company who could provide really targeted PPI for smaller niche publishers.<p>I'm not saying InstallMonetizer is that now or ever, but if someone did that, I'd be really happy with them.  It may or may not be a good business model, though.",1358661278

I sort my socks by pulling one out of the pile and visually scanning all the single socks i have laid out separately on the floor.  If there's a match, i pair them and put the pair in the drawer.  If there is no match, I lay the sock on the floor by itself.  In computational terms, this is incredibly inefficient, but in practical terms the visual scan where i iterate over all the single socks laid out on the floor is quicker than the pick-a-sock-from-the-pile operation, so typical algorithm analysis is really quite useless.",1358660779

His evidence may be flawed though. He bases his argument on the number of North Koreans who return. They might be spies, have families held hostage, are unable to adjust, face discrimination from South Koreans, or simply have thought that life would be as glamorous as a South Korean soap opera. Perhaps a few North Korean operatives are posing as defectors, tracking down real defectors, and making threats - I doubt the average defector would want to go the the authorities. Plus, I bet many defectors had an above-average life in North Korea, as they had the resources to escape. If they were promised a promotion at home, they might think it's better than cleaning toilets in South Korea (facing possible violence from North Korean operatives). I'm just guessing, but so is everyone else.<p>As for what the average North Korean <i>actually</i> thinks, it's hardly relevant. They <i>act</i> like they believe the fascist propaganda.",1358659479

However all I can remember doing on these computers were playing games - AOL Kids, Math Blaster, JumpStart and Zoombinis.<p>I didn't start programming until I was 13 (out of my own curiosity) and I wasn't offered any sort of programming classes by my junior year in high school.<p>My point is I think for most of us who grew up in the era of graphical interfaces, computers have always been glorified xboxes. When GUIs were introduced and we had options like Math Blaster I don't think many of us actually considered that we could write our own games. In elementary school I think the bar may be a little too high (not to say it can't be done). That said, it didn't matter to us that the machines were directly programmable. We didn't have the resources to create our own MathBlaster and I don't think any of us would have patience to wrestle with gcc.<p>I think Codify is a much better tool for teaching programming than a plain text file would be.

And for all that the TM ""programming language"" isn't that efficient, certainly almost anything you can describe in a reasonable English paragraph is, say, well less than 100 states in a TM. For all of Graham's Number's stonking size, in algorithmic terms, it still isn't that complicated.<p>Generally speaking, human attempts to create Big Numbers by fancy recursively-applied algorithms are still quite simple to put into a TM. This is why it's an interesting point that we don't even understand what exactly a BB(5) solution is doing; a mere five states and the human mind is already lost, lost, lost. I think of Busy Beaver as showing in its own way just how thoroughly we have <i>not</i> mastered math, and never will master more than a tiny little island that happens to be relatively easy to follow, because BB shows us that we don't have to swim out into the great sea of ""all math"" very far at all for there to be monsters.",1358658432

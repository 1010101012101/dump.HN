Well, not completely defeated as I got it &quot;working,&quot; but I couldn&#x27;t claim to truly understand the configuration.<p>Asterisk&#x27;s configuration system isn&#x27;t the worst thing I&#x27;ve seen, but it reminds me of Sendmail, which (if you don&#x27;t know) is not a polite thing to say.<p>Of course now there are probably glossy Asterisk distros you can run in a VM and configure via WUI.  But I&#x27;m obstinate enough that I want to understand the text config.<p>There is also FreePBX, but I know nothing about it.<p>Even further off topic, I&#x27;d recommend the Obihai boxes as a cheap way to get started.  No affiliation, I just have an OBi110.  It&#x27;s about as easy to configure as Asterisk itself.  (Why is all this VoIP kit horrible to set up?)  However, Obi has a through-the-web quick configuration that will hook it up to Google Voice with no other hardware/software.

People who write about the future should not miss the mark so completely. The characters are still writing letters by hand and spending days travelling around a single continent.<p>2. It is hilariously sexist. The intellectual elite are simply assumed to be male and as they may not marry, women are privileged if they are able to take them as lovers for a short time. This is the only time women are mentioned in the book.<p>3. The main character takes the I-Ching seriously. He&#x27;s supposed to be a genius, and yet he believes in horoscopes.<p>4.

Your email address is currently your core online identity and it would take a major shift to change that. That alone fortifies email&#x27;s position psychologically.<p>I see four main uses for email: 1) communication within a business, 2) communication between businesses, 3) social communication between individuals, and 4) communication between businesses and individuals. Groupware solutions/messaging/etc have tried to replace email for #1 for some time but email is still needed alongside it for communication with the outside world (#2, #4) and because a lot of enterprise software relies on email for their workflows. Social networks have made huge inroads in replacing email for individual to individual communications but their adoption is still not yet universal. I&#x27;ve also personally seen many people default to email after using a social network as an address book-- maybe email is just a more personal method since there is a stronger sense of owning the messages? Or maybe it&#x27;s easier to check email than keep up to date on several social networks. Finally, as an individual interacting with a business (legit marketing, but also order confirmations, other notifications, etc.) email still is preferred since it is so universal and won&#x27;t require leaning on another business for them to conduct their own business.<p>I&#x27;d be interested to know if others have a similar taxonomy or if they are aware of better, non-email solutions that can simultaneously cover more of those use cases.",1427441545

I was working as hard as i could, trying to figure everything out, and having several massive programs that we were working on it made it extremely hard.\nAnd as you, all the developer were each person for him self.

9275056,comment,9274047,9275013,0,0,Animats,,,"My point is that it&#x27;s possible to extend the Rust model to check this at compile time. The borrow checker has to understand backpointers.  The owned object cannot outlive the owner, so a simple backpointer is safe in that sense. But ownership can change, and when it does, the backpointer must also change.<p>The Rust ownership model can almost do this now. A move-type assignment to the forward pointer which causes a change in ownership would have to do a mutable borrow on the backpointer to get exclusive use, then change the backpointer to the new owner.  That prevents a change to the backpointer while it&#x27;s being used for something.  The borrow checker would have to understand that those two pointers are tied together by an invariant.  There would need to be syntax for back references, understood by initialization as well as moves.<p>It&#x27;s such a common case that it&#x27;s worth the special handling. It would let you do trees and doubly-linked lists without reference counts.<p>The Rust ownership model is very powerful.  I was fooling around with something like this a decade ago as an improvement to  C++, but all I expected to get out of it was the elimination of reference count updates when you passed an object to a function without giving the function permission to delete or keep the object. Rust pushes that model much harder, and it works.  It can be pushed even further to make more common use cases compile-time checkable.  This would cover more common idioms from C++.<p>Another possible extension is lifetimes on objects allocated with &quot;new&quot;.  If you need to add something to a tree, you want the new objects to have the same lifetime as the tree.  If you could specify a lifetime in &quot;new&quot;, resulting in an object being allocated in an outer scope, that would cover the idiom where you call some &quot;add to data structure&quot; function and it creates objects to be added to the data structure. Currently in Rust, you have to create new objects from within the scope that owns the data structure, then call some function to install them in the data structure.<p>The idea of creating an object in an outer scope seems strange, but when you create a closure, you&#x27;re doing just that.",1427440433

9275042,comment,9272275,9272721,0,0,mjn,,,"Fwiw some of the later logic-programming work coming out of Prolog has produced languages with Prolog-like syntax but without statement order being significant, and guaranteed termination. This paradigm, Answer Set Programming (ASP), is also based on solvers, so has some relationship to SMT, but feels more like Prolog to program, e.g. it has negation-as-failure. My favorite implementation is from the University of Potsdam [1].<p>Imo it&#x27;s a much nicer modeling language, especially for incremental formalization, in part because of implementing a nonmonotonic rather than classical logic. It also has a nice generative-programming style where you can define generative spaces via &quot;choice rules&quot;, where the solver is explicitly given a free choice for some variables, subject to constraints, and returns a satisfying artifact/model. That allows using it to construct constrained generative systems (e.g. generative music [2], level generation [3]). But Z3 far outperforms ASP solvers on problems where variables range over large domains (like &quot;32-bit integer&quot;) because of the MT part of SMT. There&#x27;s some experimental work on trying to combine the approaches, using Z3 (or another SMT solver) as the solver backend for a logic-programming system [4], but I don&#x27;t know how usable it is.<p>[1] <a href=""http://potassco.sourceforge.net/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://potassco.sourceforge.net/</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://arxiv.org/abs/1006.4948"" rel=""nofollow"">http://arxiv.org/abs/1006.4948</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://pcgbook.com/wp-content/uploads/chapter08.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://pcgbook.com/wp-content/uploads/chapter08.pdf</a><p>[4] <a href=""http://peace.eas.asu.edu/joolee/papers/aspmt-system-jelia.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://peace.eas.asu.edu/joolee/papers/aspmt-system-jelia.pd...</a>",1427439957

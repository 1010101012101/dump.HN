Another option could be a script that goes through all your plans (such as calendar events) and deletes or corrupts those ones mentioning physical activity. On another note, perhaps a script could be made that, whenever you start up something productive like an IDE, the script closes it and opens up a time-wasting webpage or game in its place.

A common practice after that was not only rape by military, but they put dogs to rape woman. They took their fingers off and put them in cells full of shit so they had to avoid the infections. Put them in really small spaces until they were lost.<p>This were process made by days, they didn&#x27;t get into shock status, they were destroyed as human beings.

GTA 5 cost $137 million to develop and, due to the comparative scopes, it can be estimated that Star Citizen would cost more.<p>People are unbelievably ignorant about how much a AAA title costs to produce.

The scope of the game is accelerating in the face of decelerating sponsorship.<p>Where has the money gone? Probably to the features that he has promised - sadly, not enough to any one single feature. $94 million simply isn&#x27;t enough.

10532783,comment,10526443,10526443,0,0,padobson,,,"Interaction design is a craft, and gaming is the subcategory of interaction design that most often ventures into the world of art. But the thing that most constrains the artform is this &quot;little brother&quot; mindset. Instead of waiting for society to understand and comprehend the medium, those who craft video games work to make their medium more like film or novels or music or other &quot;high&quot; artforms.<p>So I get a little twitchy when a gaming website does a story about a franchise like StarCraft and features the writing as the game changing aspect of it. StarCraft is not great because it&#x27;s a sci-fi game. Warcraft is not great because it has ogres. Super Mario Brothers is not great because it has a chubby Italian plumber.<p>Interaction design often requires some metaphor - some analogy to inspire your first interaction with the system. The plumber, the ogre, the Zealot. But once you push that first button, and the system responds, the analogy is no longer the inspiration for delight, for frustration, for joy or pain. The interaction itself becomes the driving factor. And the most perfectly crafted interactions can inspire the full range of emotions without relying on a coherent plot, orchestrated sound, or ten minutes of FMV.<p>And StarCraft is one of the greatest examples of this. I don&#x27;t care what a Zealot&#x27;s motivation is, I only care about how much ground he can cover before the Hydra destroys him. My pulse is rising because the HP of my units is falling and my army is shrinking faster than my opponent&#x27;s, not because I feel bad that the Zealots didn&#x27;t procure the glory their race yearns after.<p>If gaming is ever going to take its proper place in the pantheon of higher artforms, it needs to stop acting like something it&#x27;s not. Video games aren&#x27;t movies, and they never will be. I hope the video games industry figures this out someday.",1447074424

One weekend, we decided to drive up to LA from San Diego.<p>We drove as close as we could to the Hollywood sign, and got to a cul de sac where we saw a few cars parked, and a few families hiking down a hill from the sign.<p>We parked, and walked up the hill, noticing a sign that said it was illegal to hike to the sign. We questioned whether it was a good idea to ignore the sign, but seeing as whole families were ignoring it, we thought it would be fine.<p>We hiked for a few minutes, and then saw a security guard pull up in a car near our cars. I wasn&#x27;t sure how legally I was parked, so we went back to avoid a ticket.<p>The guard ignores all the families, and targets us, asking us what we were doing hiking up there. We said we just wanted a picture, and he yelled at us about the sign. We said we didn&#x27;t see it, and he called us idiots. He asked to see our IDs, at which point, my friend started talking back, saying no way. Being that we were Canadian, and on work visas, I didn&#x27;t want to push my luck, being a minority too. I knew that if this guard called the cops, I&#x27;d be in a bit more trouble, and I thought I&#x27;d be in jeopardy of getting shipped back to Canada. It didn&#x27;t help that the friend mouthing back wasn&#x27;t a minority; I don&#x27;t think he realized how scared we are in general of cops.<p>My friend kept mouthing off, saying that the guard had no right to talk to us like that, and we were going to leave. At this point, the guard says he&#x27;s calling the cops, and that we have to deal with them.<p>At this point, I jumped in, asked the guard to calm down, and that I&#x27;ll talk to him privately. He told me to tell my friend to watch his tone, and I pleaded with him to let us go, since I really didn&#x27;t want to deal with the cops over something minor on account of us not being American. He copied down my info from my license, gave us a warning, and let us go.<p>Now, I did know my &quot;rights&quot;, and I knew he had no grounds to detain us. But I didn&#x27;t know those signs were fake, so I really thought we might be in trouble. Also, I didn&#x27;t know if those rights applied to us as non-Americans. My friends said I was an idiot for giving my ID, and I agreed, but I just wanted to get out of there. I was 22 at the time too, so I probably was a bit more naive.<p>Reading this article brought back this memory, and now makes me realize how we were bamboozled. Live and learn I suppose.",1447074246

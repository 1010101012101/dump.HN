4835994,comment,4833218,4835237,8,0,jacquesm,,,"> The infamous microkernel debate?<p>Yes.<p>> Did the experience from writing your own OS solidify that belief?<p>Absolutely. Micro-kernels have many advantages other than a slight overhead due to message passing (and a large chunk o that overhead can be overcome by using the paging mechanism in a clever way). They're easier to secure, much easier to stabilize, support such luxuries as on the fly upgrades without powering down with grace and allow you to develop drivers in userland greatly simplifying debugging and testing as well as allowing you to do hard real-time (and by extension soft real time) much easier than you could ever do it using a macro kernel.<p>I've built some pretty large systems using QnX in the 80's and 90's that I would have a real problem with re-implementing even today on todays hardware without the benefits brought by a micro kernel with network transparent message passing. If you haven't used a setup like that then it is probably hard to see the advantages, it goes way beyond some theoretical debate.<p>In practice two systems side-by-side, one running QnX, one running Linux will have the QnX system come out way ahead in terms of responsiveness for interactive tasks and things like latency and real world throughput.<p>We'll never know what the world would have looked like if Linus hadn't been as pig headed during that whole debate. Likely we wouldn't be stuck with a re-write of a 30 year old kernel.<p>The bit where Linux got it right and Tanenbaum got it wrong was that GPL'ing an OS was a <i>much</i> better move than to do a deal with Prentice Hall (who published the minix source). And minix wasn't the most elegant micro kernel either, which may have skewed Linus' perception of what it was that Tanenbaum was getting at.<p>My guess is if he would have used QnX instead of having looked at minix that he would have readily agreed with Tanenbaum, but we'll never know about that and Linux is here to stay for a long time.<p>If you haven't used QnX give it a shot and see how it works for you, you might be pleasantly surprised.",1353999121

From that standpoint drones are preferable --they offer an asymmetrical aspect to the war, so it might seen it as unfair, but that's beside the point as IEDs are seen as unfair as well.  With UAVs Fewer friendlies die, and fewer civilians on the enemy side die due to the more precise aspect of the engagement.  Even with the misses, drone engagement results in fewer casualties for both sides.<p>Look at it this way, if the US had had drones during the VN conflict, the US would not have incurred 50,000 casualties and the VC would not have suffered ~2,000,000 casualties.

4835971,comment,4833218,4835893,2,0,derefr,,,"> If the goal is to write a small RTOS on a small but nicely-featured microcontroller, then the C books and the uC/OS book might be a good shove in the right direction. Things start getting complicated if you need to write such things as a full USB stack, PCIe subsystem, graphics drivers, etc.<p>I've always wondered if there could be created some way to skip this step in [research] OS prototyping, by creating a shared library (exokernel?) of just drivers, while leaving the ""design decisions"" of the OS (system calls, memory management, scheduling, filesystems, &c.--you know, the things people get into OS development to play with) to the developer.<p>People already sort of do this by targeting an emulator like VirtualBox to begin with--by doing so, you only (initially) need one driver for each feature you want to add, and the emulator takes care of portability. But this approach can't be scaled up to a hypervisor (Xen) or KVM, because those expect their guest operating systems to also have relevant drivers for (at least some of) the hardware.<p>I'm wondering at this point if you could, say, fork Linux to strip it down to ""just the drivers"" to start such a project (possibly even continuing to merge in driver-related commits from upstream) or if this would be a meaningless proposition--how reliant are various drivers of an OS on OS kernel-level daemons that themselves rely on the particular implementation of OS process management, OS IPC, etc.? Could you code for the Linux driver-base without your project growing strongly isomorphic structures such as init, acpid, etc.?<p>Because, if you could--if the driver-base could just rely on a clean, standardized, exported C API from the rest of the kernel, then perhaps (and this is the starry-eyed dream of mine) we could move ""hardware support development"" to a separate project from ""kernel development"", and projects like HURD and Plan9 could ""get off the ground"" in terms of driver support.",1353998570

4835962,comment,4835376,4835694,9,0,ChuckMcM,,,"Gondolas, like elevated monorails and trains, have an unfortunate failure mode which is 'stopped and trapped' so in the event the system has to stop, everyone is 'trapped'. Back in pre-historic times when Disney ran their 'people mover' (which finessed the load/unload option quite well with the moving platform, one load/unload every 10 seconds) they talked about systems with excess cable such that in an emergency the gondolas could all lower to the ground. But that is impractical in longer runs (the wire buffer needs to be too long) and has its own issue if it lowers the gondolas in a non-emergency situation.<p>The best things they have going for them are that you can easily re-use existing right of way, and the per-mile implementation costs can be lower than conventional light rail or subways.<p>My favorite system that was spec'd but never built was the Chicago PRT (Personal Rapid Transit) which had four person 'cars' on a track that worked like elevators.

The problem is that the average highschooler is struggling immensely to get to that basic baseline at the time of graduation.  Additionally with the very real budget and over-capacity problems, when new core curriculum is proposed the first predicament is what is going to have to get axed in its place.  Somebody is going to have to pick something to say goodbye to that is actually truly core learning.  Yes Im sure we all have our favorites of what we think is non-essential core curriclulum but in reality our opinions don't count and to be a realist they probably shouldn't - only the opinions of the district, administrators, teachers and parents count in any real way.

I'll stop here.<p>Of course, the equivalent knowledge can be obtained by trial-and-error, which would take longer and might result in costly errors and imperfect design.  The greater danger here is that a sole developer, without the feedback and interaction of even a small group of capable and experienced programmers could simply burn a lot of time repeating the mistakes made by those who have already trenched that territory.<p>If the goal is to write a small RTOS on a small but nicely-featured microcontroller, then the C books and the uC/OS book might be a good shove in the right direction.  Things start getting complicated if you need to write such things as a full USB stack, PCIe subsystem, graphics drivers, etc.",1353996427

Then, they will have a basis to make informed decisions for their future fields of study and work.<p>Teaching CS in high school doesn't mean everyone needs to be a software engineer.

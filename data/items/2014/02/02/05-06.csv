Last week, I was drawn by Microsoft&#x27;s attention to detail, UI, and UX, and have already started migrating from OS X 10.9 to Windows 8.1. (I&#x27;m typing this in IE11 right now on my rMBP actually, and I think I prefer it to Chrome.) The ideas and presentations in his article don&#x27;t settle well with me. They feel like a huge step backwards in usability and design. I admit Windows 8.1 isn&#x27;t perfect, but I don&#x27;t think his changes fix any real problems that I have with it, and they certainly create some new ones.<p>That said, I am excited to see how MS is going to make the desktop environment more unified and consistent in the future, which I&#x27;m sure they&#x27;re working on.",1391320669

Of course the Smile payout is a fraction of what the affiliate percentage pays. I was thinking about just having a page of with maybe the current top 50 items (five rows of ten) for the week in Amazon&#x27;s sales rank - as cards with thumbnail and name/price/rating. Then I&#x27;d rotate through charities each week based on visitor input, verify the week&#x27;s haul for them and cut a check to the charity. An alternative to the top 50 items would be to incorporate items related to LifeHacker&#x27;s &quot;best times to buy&quot; lists.

There&#x27;s not going to be one universal way for humans to interact with a computer, period. Sometimes touch will be used, sometimes keyboards & mice, sometimes voice, sometimes other methods of control. It&#x27;s vastly more valuable to figure out how to seamlessly transition between different modes of use/control and to maximize the utility of each mode than to try to engineer some grand compromise design that can be used in all modes but takes advantage of none of them very well.<p>Moreover, Microsoft needs to learn a very hard lesson here. If you want to change things you need to transition. UI reboots are like system rewrites, they carry a lot of the same risks, if you commit to the new system before it&#x27;s mature without giving people the option of using the old system you&#x27;ll often times end up with rejection instead of acceptance. Microsoft has developed a bad habit lately of ramming new ways of doing things down users throats without any time to get used to the changes.

If you mean package management is inherently broken because different software may depend on different versions of libraries then that sounds like an issue you&#x27;d have with the software developer. I know that in itself could be a gripe with Linux software, but show me one regular computer user who has ever experienced broken package dependencies. The vast, VAST majority of regular Ubuntu user software is installed through the Software Center and the only times I&#x27;ve ever gotten broken dependencies were when I was specifically trying to install an older version of something.<p><pre><code>    I do not use anything Apple but if I recall correctly OS X uses\n    self-contained .app bundles i.e. the apps usually include all \n    their dependencies except those present on a particular OS X version \n    by default.\n</code></pre>\nOSX has .dmg files for installing applications. Debian&#x27;s .deb packages are the exact same thing. Bundling all dependencies can be done in Linux the same way -- again the app developer can statically link to libraries.<p>The fact of the matter is that Linux is NOT a usability nightmare and it&#x27;s dishonest to say that.

In some cases, the scammers may only put through a small charge of several dollars, so it won&#x27;t arouse suspicion.<p>Calls typically originate from outside the United States. One woman told BBB her caller ID indicated the call originated in Antigua or Barbuda (area code 268). Other consumers across the country report calls from the Dominican Republic (809), Jamaica (876), British Virgin Islands (284) and Grenada (473).<p>The practice of third parties placing unauthorized charges on wireless accounts is called &quot;cramming.&quot; The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) and Federal Communications Commission (FCC) have reviewed thousands of complaints about the practice, and expect the problem to grow.<p>Better Business Bureau recommends if you don&#x27;t recognize an out-of-state telephone number on your caller ID, ignore it and if you do answer, do not call back.

7164914,comment,7161926,7163975,17,0,lispsil,,,"I witnessed this in highschool. The first school I went to was extremely authoritarian and was grade 8-12. Fights and bullies a common occurrence. I didn&#x27;t have a problem dealing with them but other kids had a brutal time, pushed down the stairs breaking their jaws, fights everyday, kids waiting around the field after dark to catch you crossing it by yourself for a brutal beating, one kid had his hair lit on fire in chem 11 class, police would shake the students down for drugs and weapons almost every week.<p>I got kicked out for redboxing the school payphone and for reciting the lyrics to Nazi school and saluting my detention room minders, which is some old 80s song on the KBD comps <a href=""http://youtu.be/QJ5kuA_66u8"" rel=""nofollow"">http://youtu.be/QJ5kuA_66u8</a><p>I was sent by my country&#x27;s ministry of education to a school of &#x27;criminal youth&#x27; with 1200 students and no rules that was 10-12 grade. Not one fight. Many of the kids were serious gangsters involved in operating drug lines or fresh out of juvie hall. With no rules to rebel against everybody hung out including geeky neckbeards with Christian Audiger wearing Gs. They told us it was up to us to pass or fail, they weren&#x27;t responsible and we could do anything we wanted including not showing up. Meanwhile my friends would lament of the stifling rules and regulations back in my old school that saw endemic violence and brutality. The more you try to control people the worse they become it seems.<p>My first week at the new school I acted like I was still in an institution by booting my books down the halls, and generally being a complete goof. Nobody paid attention to me and my antics didn&#x27;t move me up the social ladder. There&#x27;s no reason to rebel against a place without any rules that tells you your own actions will decide if you sink or swim. No nannies phoning home to your parents saying you didn&#x27;t show up, no detention, no late slips, no punishment for disrupting a class either. We would talk to each other in the middle of a lecture and the teacher didn&#x27;t go on a massive power trip trying to punish and humiliate us in front of all the other students. We were just told that if we didn&#x27;t listen or respect the teachers we&#x27;d fail in life, so we listened.<p>Compare that to my last school when in grade 8 I was dragged into a Socials 12 class because the instructor thought I made a racist comment in the hallways when it was some other older kids who did while passing by. He basically encouraged the other Grade 12 students to &#x27;teach me a lesson&#x27; through violence and would harass me on a regular basis because of this. I reacted like any other kid, become a total nightmare student and get kicked out.",1391317245

I would revisit your problem and see if you can't get memcached to fit before you decide to reinvent the wheel.<p>If you're set on MySQL, assuming you are on Linux (or a similar platform) you should consider perhaps using BDB or MyISAM for your storage engine and just keeping the data on a ram disk. This will give you wicked fast reads.",1203424215

This is very specific and there are a lot of things that I never learnt at school or in programming books. How to manage memory, what is a heap, manage the stack, define memory sections, bootloader, RTOS... do you know a good book that cover these kind of things?",1203424015

You should refuse to learn a new set of keybindings because the set you already know is the set that well over 90% of the world and 90% of the world's desktop applications use.  (I have not used this CUA mode of Emacs that other commenters mention.)",1203423275

The programming reddit is still a better place for hacker/coding links (and comments) IMO, just avoid the other reddits. =)",1203422798
118847,comment,117949,118347,0,0,marvin,,,"It doesn't have to be entirely based on past performance - you could do some statistical analysis on the number of funds, which funds are associated with individual investors, fund returns and find whether the distribution of returns overlaps with the distribution that says ""the best funds were just lucky"".<p>What I am interested in knowing is whether the best investors are able to beat the market over time. And there is a lot of anecdotal evidence that suggests this, for example (a rather extreme one, though) the best hedge funds which have generated an annualized 30% return over more than 15 years. With especially high returns when the rest of the world is tanking. Although this is an edge case, this kind of track record doesn't exactly scream ""lucky"".",1203422506

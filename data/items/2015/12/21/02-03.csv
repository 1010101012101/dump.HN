That was before git or other sane source control and I basically inserted a semi-obfuscated piece of code in the source repository, which gave our team an advantage in the game (the game was to crack and find a weakness in a protocol, but the whole machine was a target/battlefield). The clever part was first rooting the server via suid vulnerability.<p>I won the contest, but while doing it I thought, yeah, this shit will never work in the real world.

Marvel got an all brand new universe after destroying Earth-616 and the Ultimate universe to make Secret Wars, and then after Secret Wars they changed things up in the comic books. Star Wars they basically rewrote Episode 4 A New Hope as Episode 7 The Force Awakens by changing the character names and roles. All of this is focused on the young that didn&#x27;t watch or read the original materials. Disney is youth focused, so us older people in our childhood we had things different in Marvel and Star Wars, and under Disney they have been recycled and changed for a global market now instead of just the USA, etc.<p>There was a time when the Disney Channel was stealing ideas from Nickelodeon for shows with teens/tweens. But now owning Marvel and Star Wars they can make shows based on those characters on their own channel without having to steal ideas from others.",1450666688

I&#x27;d get comments like &quot;wouldn&#x27;t it be better if you made this (only used once and very trivial) line of code a separate function?&quot; &quot;could you use more classes?&quot; (for a <100LoC script-ish thing that had almost no duplicated code nor much in the way of loops.) It&#x27;s almost as if they can&#x27;t get their heads around how <i>simple</i> something can be, so it somehow feels very wrong to them.<p>Then there&#x27;s the extremist &quot;premature optimisation is evil&quot; attitude, which I think is completely misguided because more code and complexity is bad not only in terms of computer time but also programmer time --- it takes more time for programmers to design, write, read, and debug more complex code.",1450666613

I&#x27;ll be rooting for you!<p>Let me try to poke a hole or two in it for you. Not to discourage you, of course, but just to try and get you to think of some of the harder, less technical problems you may run into.<p>First, there&#x27;s a fine line between a HAL and a full-fledged operating system, so be careful there! It&#x27;s also hard to justify adding overhead or third party code to a system in many cases, especially if you&#x27;re manufacturing for six sigma. You want every system to be in your complete control, because it turns out that making reliable products is _hard_.<p>I also don&#x27;t see something like a universally-used HAL becoming mainstream anytime soon; for almost all production purposes (I don&#x27;t know the number, of course, but perhaps on the order of 99%) a 50kHz chip with a 30-year old design is _exactly_ what you want. In most cases, you want to use a tried-and-true workhorse that you can get for $0.012 each, and not have to use a $2 chip that&#x27;s powerful enough to run the HAL.<p>BUT a universal HAL could be great for hobbyists. Port your code easily from arduino to a powerful RISC to some other platform. That&#x27;d be great :)<p>BEST of luck!!",1450666451

As long as you believe that ads actually work and influence people then you are imposing a cost on your users.<p>There are websites which are actually free to end users. They don&#x27;t serve ads, they might have a donation page, and largely exist because the operator simply wants to publish something. Most of the &#x27;old web&#x27; embodies these qualities.<p>The assumption that the only way for websites to make money is via ads or paywalls is completely pervasive and it&#x27;s simply not true. These two options are the most naive monetization strategies. My favorite counterexample is the Welcome to Nightvale Podcast. Their podcast is gratis and without ads. They make money through donations, selling swag, their book, and by performing live shows -- all which sell out extremely fast because I&#x27;ve been trying to get tickets recently.<p>The Internet is quite expensive because of ads.",1450666419

And that &quot;somewhere&quot; is far closer to the origin than points out in some arbitrarily distant tail.<p>Now obviously if you want to make stronger claims about a specific origin, you&#x27;ll need to specify a particular probability distribution, and justify why that&#x27;s the right one. I agree that a non-asymptotic Occams razor is an additional assumption.<p>But you also get pretty far with the asymptotic theory. Consider a theory of &quot;green&quot; as compared to a theory of &quot;bleen&quot; (namely that green turns to blue after some time T). You have a prior with some probability that only green exists (say 50%), and also a 50% chance that green turns to blue after some time T. But now you have a continuous distribution over T.<p>Now suppose you want to make a prediction - e.g., H = &quot;the grass will be green, not blue, at t=50&quot;. When you compute a posterior, you reject all values of T < 0 (supposing the present time is 0). Also, all values of T > 50 actually yield the same prediction as &quot;only green exists&quot;. So the only way you can get a prediction of blue at time 50 is if 0 < T < 50. Of course, the more time you spend gathering data, the further into the tail you move and the less likely it is that your posterior will predict blue. I.e., Bayesian stats even with very few assumptions gets sensible results eventually.<p>I do in fact hold the view that Bayesian probability is a consistent theory of the scientific method, and also of how humans should update their beliefs when new evidence is gathered.<p>(Minor nit: your continuous asymptotic form isn&#x27;t slightly wrong for this purpose, f(x) need not approach zero. Counterexample: f(x) = 1 for x \in [1, 1+2^{-1}], [2, 2+2^{-2}], etc, f(x) = 0 elsewhere. That integrates out to 1/2 + 1/4 + ... = 1, but lim_{x -> \infty} f(x) doesn&#x27;t exist.)<p>[I&#x27;m also a bit surprised you are being so heavily downvoted.

10769284,comment,10765148,10765148,0,0,machuidel,,,"Have been using the ReST philosophy (or pattern?) for almost 15 years without any issues. ReST itself does not define the use of a specific technology and is not a standard by itself, it is pretty abstract. Using the URI and HTTP standards are just a way to apply it. Other technologies can be used as well, like SMTP / MIME or something developed yourself as soon as the ReST constraints can be applied. Adding the ReST constraints is what brings the advantages. It is really flexible and allows for easy composition of &quot;layers&quot; through &quot;connectors&quot;. A caching proxy is an example of a &quot;connector&quot;. If ReST could be compared to something in programming it is very similar to &quot;monads&quot; as used in functional programming.<p>Recursion can be done by the use of nested &quot;resource identifiers&quot; (SSI or ESI for example) inside the returned &quot;representation&quot;. A &quot;connector&quot; may then decide to do another request to replace the &quot;identifier&quot;. If the &quot;connector&quot; uses caching it may not even need to do another sub-request. I use this to do something like what Facebook&#x27;s Relay does. As the full state is always being sent along with every request it is very easy to scale because the servers, wherever they are, always have enough context to be able to work with it. A server may even ignore what it does not understand for the next layer to handle it called &quot;partial understanding&quot; which is supported by XML for example. Unfortunately when using JSON most of these advantages are lost. That is why I prefer a less verbose &quot;XML Infoset&quot; similar to JSON while still keeping all the advantages.",1450665829

If the language helped me guarantee that this was never NULL, that would be one thing, but it doesn&#x27;t, and the compiler has decided, for reasons I don&#x27;t understand, to remove one of the only mechanisms I currently have to detect, log, and mitigate.<p>References are a similar thing: it would be one thing if dereferencing a NULL pointer caused my program to crash, so clearly the NULL checks on the address of a reference are not useful. But it doesn&#x27;t work like that. Dereferencing a NULL pointer returns a NULL reference that doesn&#x27;t cause a crash until the pointer is <i>used</i>. This is actually kind of similar to weakly-linked symbols, where a declared function can have its address be NULL. This is a feature of linkers and the compiler and puts people in a regime where it sometimes makes a lot of sense to compare the address of an expression with NULL.<p>But somehow, this one is special; so special that even though the compiler knew what I wanted so clearly it felt the need to spit out a paragraph of nonsense at me to tell me that I should remove this check, and that it really didn&#x27;t want this check in my code in the first place, if I was stupid enough to leave it in my code it was going to delete it for me. I just... I don&#x27;t understand how that is even remotely reasonable behavior. If it was a side effect of the optimizer and there was no way to surmise what I wanted, then that would be one thing: but the compiler is detecting my code, and demanding that either I remove it myself or it will take control?

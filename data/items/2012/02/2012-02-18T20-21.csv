Looking back, would you have taken an offer right out of high school to work full time for a year doing software development?<p>Let me give a little background - I've been working part time for this company for a year. I like the work, I'm good at it, and they like me. This week they'll be making me an offer for one year full time.<p>This does make a conflict, however, as I have the tuition to UCF (University of Central Florida) completely covered with scholarships which I would lose if I took the 1 year deferment.<p>Also, what salary do you highly intelligent folks think would be acceptable for a software developer  with one year experience right out of high school (assuming I get no benefits).<p>Thanks for the input.",1329598796

Let's say a town of 100 farmers need a dam built and there is a net benefit even if only 50 contribute to building the dam. Now there is a huge incentive for the farmers to play chicken with each other to see who will pay up first. The ""free riders"" that don't pay for the dam will have extra money to buy more land or other resources to take better advantage of the new dam's benefits.<p>In this case it is fair for the town government to pay for the dam with taxes.

You can have unboxed ""value-types"" (const structs, essentially) in dynamic languages. In fact, you could even differentiate between a ""boxed"" ref type and a value type at runtime, because refs don't  need all 64 bits of the pointer. So a ref is a 64 bit pointer with the first bit set to, say, 0, and a value (struct) type always begins with a 64 bit pointer to it's type information, only it's tagged with MSB of 1. Since you can't extend concrete types, you can easily store value types inline in an array, and just have the type-info pointer (which must be the same for all elements, b/c there is no inheritance) at the beginning of the array. And if your structs are aligned OK, you could easily pass them to C by skipping the type-info pointer both in the single value case and in the array case.",1329597582

not just where it ends but also where it begins. This lets you do neat things (consider a filter kernel with range [-s,+s]^n instead of [1,2s]^n) and the extra complexity it adds can be hidden when not needed using for-statements or higher order functions.<p>Nobody uses it because the implementation is not very efficient and Haskellers have a chip on their shoulder about performance. It subtracts the origin and computes strides on every index, but you could easily avoid this by storing the subtracted base pointer and strides with the array. Of course when you go to implement it you'll see light on 0-based indexing :)",1329596987

They're basically white board equipped conference rooms with tables and chairs.  You walk through there, and see all sorts of groups of people meeting in those rooms, talking animatedly.  It's kind of fun to imagine what they're meeting about, I've seen evidence of startups, community groups, etc. based on what's on the board.  The rooms are pretty sound-proofed, so you don't hear them as you're perusing the books.  There's also quiet study rooms where you can do your business if you want to be absolutely quiet.  A lot of space was devoted to a cafe area, which is nice for doing coffee-shop-style laptop work (except they won't kick you out).<p>Santa Monica is the position of being an economically well-off city (and thus able to afford such a lavish library) with a significant homeless/poor population, which is very well represented in the library.  For areas in the midst of complete economic blight, I doubt there's as many niceties opening up--which is sad.<p>As is the point of the article, in the midst of all this Information Age online-this and online-that, there's a sad lack of civic-mindedness.  How does the community as a whole uplift the people within it who are not doing as well?  I doubt most of the higher-end property-tax payers in Santa Monica actually go to the library--and it is clearly servicing the people paying the least (or nothing) for it.  Sadly, most of the rhetoric I see on the public policy level is, ""I was in line at Albertson's and saw someone buying a steak with their food stamps!!!  And a bottle of wine!  How dare they?

3607609,comment,3604981,3604981,1,0,adrian201,,,"1. I think the on-boarding process to an app is probably more crucial the app itself. This is purely anecdotal, but as an early adopter whenever I go through the trouble of downloading an app which greets me with Create An Account, I'm almost always immediately turned off. In some cases I've just excited the app and hit un-install. The last thing I need is another account, with a service I may not use for more than 15mins.<p>I think the best process is to give users a feel for your product without an account being necessary. Maybe it's just in READ mode with the ability to WRITE enabled upon signup. Or just simply ask for an email address which is then used as a unique identifier for your account. Oink did this awhile back.<p>2. I think the Facebook hate is miss-placed. Do you really hate Facebook (provider of a tool) or those who spam you via Facebook (users of the tool)? If you're so worried about Facebook tracking you offsite, why have an account at all? They're in the business of collecting, optimizing, and monetizing the social graph. If their platform has more 'cons' than 'pros' I think you should ditch it and keep your tin foil hat on. I myself use it, with my tin foil hat on, but don't go through the hoops to block it as some of you are doing.",1329595875

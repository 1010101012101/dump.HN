82439,comment,81976,82251,0,0,jdavid,,,"yeah, there are a few problems for us with their service,<p>1. we live in America and because our politicians suck so much, our currency is falling (go home ownership, at the cost of our currency, frickn idiots) and its hard to track what we are really spending on a service that bills in pounds.<p>2. they are expensive, and in some cases about 2x what ec2 is.<p>3. they do not have an image deployment system like amazon, nor do they have an s3 solution.<p>all and all, i think that once we move to linux, with mono we will be better off, as we can run RoR, PHP, C#, and Java all side by side on a scalable server platform.",1195652687

82435,comment,82175,82175,0,0,edw519,,,"""I love the Internet, online communication and Facebook because these technologies allow me to do what I do best: multitask.""<p>OK, let's get this straight once and for all...<p>THERE IS NO SUCH THING AS MULTI-TASKING.<p>Even when you think you are, you aren't.  You're just switching really fast.  Probably too fast to do any one thing well.  Which makes the following statement all the more ridiculous:<p>""I want devices like BlackBerrys, Palm Pilots and the like, to allow me to stay focused on work at all times.""<p>Does anyone even remember what ""focused"" means any more?<p>Just do one thing, the most important thing until it's not the most important thing any more.  Then do THAT most important thing.  Don't need much technology for that.  Just a little discipline.<p>Now stop reading this and go do that.",1195651829

82432,story,,,1,1,uuilly,YC-Local?,,"There seems to be a yearning on yc for people to find e/o or just talk to people near them. Why not have local channels for meetups etc? Could be in the form of sub-forums or you could submit a link as local and only those who subscribe to a region in their prefs would see it. Not very creative but I've only slept an hour. Let's hear you ideas. I know the demand is there. ",1195650182

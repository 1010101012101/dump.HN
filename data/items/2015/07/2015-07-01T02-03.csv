This is based on the current best science has to offer in making things cheap.<p>The 100x multiple is to the cost of normal computation. Normal, unsecured, visible to your hosting provider, etc, computation. Companies already pay huge amounts for securing computation so a pure mathematical way to do it that&#x27;s only 100 times the base cost of the CPU time is actually a huge savings to many.<p>You don&#x27;t have to run your whole webserver this way, just the payment processing pieces...<p>2) What will happen is pure guessing because it depends on the hidden motives of others via market (and other) dynamics.<p>But the options are <i>roughly</i>,<p>A) The bitcoin blockchain remains at today&#x27;s general capacity. In this case the price per blockchain/byte will increase and people will use side-chains and &quot;link&quot; them back in as they feel appropriate. You will have the option of downloading sidechains you care about.<p>B) The bitcoin users decide on one of the proposals to increase the blockchain capacity dramatically - and all of these offer some form of prunability so you don&#x27;t need to hold the GBs of stuff you don&#x27;t care about in order to strongly verify the things you do care about (like the balance of someone who&#x27;s paying you)...<p>C) Some other currency which solves these things really is the &quot;one&quot;.<p>But these questions didn&#x27;t need asking. They&#x27;re needlessly critical - as if technologies should (or even could) all be invented at greater than 100% ROI just out of thin air, and as if market dynamics wouldn&#x27;t handle things anyway. If this solution is too expensive, nobody will use it. There are no externalities involved here, nobody is getting a free lunch; they&#x27;ll only pay for it if it helps them overall.",1435719101

Having an algorithmically designed logo tie the room together -- crystallize a company&#x27;s business and culture, and provide a memorable rallying point -- that&#x27;s the hard part. Computer-generated design is like a ghostly thread of expression of the design sensibilities of the writers of the software from which it emerges.<p>Consider the hidden arrow in the &quot;Ex&quot; of FedEx, when they rebranded from &quot;Federal Express&quot;; the rational propeller of BMW; even something as simple as the Burger King logo being sandwiched in a hamburger bun. Granted, logo design is just one small corner of design in general, but algorithmically generated logos do indeed result in a herd of swooshes, globes, and rings orbiting bold text (notwithstanding the similar designs of many humans who fail to recruit sufficient creativity or inspiration).

Also, some of my favorite artists that I routinely listen to on Spotify have gaps in their catalogues (Tipper).<p>Say what you will about Spotify, but their native iOS app is really top-notch. I keep finding little details that make my user experience so much more delightful. For example, I recently learned that you could swipe left and right on the &quot;now playing&quot; bar on the bottom to move between songs. It feels really organic and I wish other players would adopt it. I also just found out that you can swipe right on songs to queue them up for playback, and now I use it all the time. Dunno WTF happened with their desktop client, though.<p>Oh, and now that I&#x27;ve learned that you can (secretly) search Spotify by genre (&#x27;genre:&quot;progressive metal&quot;&#x27;) and see the top tracks, my life (and music discovery) have been much improved.

This seems to me like publishing programs - some of them thousands of lines long - and expecting them to be essentially bug-free without ever running them.<p>I think that the important distinction is &#x27;peer-reviewed&#x27;.  A random programme published, even by a very good programmer, is indeed likely to have errors; but I think that one can have more confidence in a peer-reviewed programme (which is essentially why we trust open source over closed source, after all).<p>Of course there are distinctions:  software is automatically tested when used, whereas mathematics is not automatically tested when read, so that one might reasonably have more confidence in software purely on the basis of its longevity than one does in mathematics; but, on the other hand, although individual pieces of reasoning can be extremely arcane, &#x27;flow control&#x27; in mathematical reasoning tends to be much more elementary than in software, so that one is unlikely to uncover the mathematical analogue of an infrequently visited branch in a code path going untested despite heavy use of the software.",1435717136

A psych ward is essentially a jail; not an unfashionably appointed hotel as the author suggests.  The worst part is looking out the window and realizing you can&#x27;t leave.  I could bear the three schizophrenic cases who collectively screamed, danced and twitched catatonically.  The borderline girl would shout that her father raped her and that she was in there because of a vengeful social worker.  One girl tried to hang herself in the bathroom with strung together kotex. None of this was remotely bothersome in comparison to not having my freedom.<p>Immediately after leaving the hospital I stopped taking my medication (Seroquel - for sleep, 200mg [this is off-label and 4 times the dose for insomnia], Prozac 20mg).  It was causing me unbearable side effects.  Despite being unmedicated and untreated, I was stable for 6 years until after moving up north.  I became depressed again and was put on Zoloft.  Zoloft triggered a prolonged hypomanic episode which doctors tried to treat with multiple medications over 4 months.  It was a terrible time.<p>Ultimately I told all the psychiatrists and doctors to shove off.  I started using light (and darkness) therapy, because after examining my history all of my depressive episodes were in the winter.  I never had any sort of disruptive manic episodes outside of the Zoloft incident.  I also started exercising 4 times a week, which has largely protected me from any sort of depression in the winter (along with the lightbox).<p>Psychiatry is closer to witchcraft than medical practice.  It&#x27;s a bumbling attempt to treat an organ we have yet to understand.  I feel deeply sorry for anyone who has gone through the type of unnecessary suffering I experienced.  There really needs to be stricter regulations and oversight of the practice, because it&#x27;s in a shameful state.",1435716862

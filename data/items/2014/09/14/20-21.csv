Distilled water is by itself neutral, but as you note, CO2 and other gases will dissolve in it, forming weak acids.<p>That happens when rain falls, but will also occur in the lab when distilled water is exposed to air.  In that case, pH will be variably slightly less than 7.0.  That&#x27;s the reason calibration of pH meters relies on carefully prepared buffer solutions which are much less affected by airborne gases.<p>Neutrality of distilled water could be improved by boiling it to drive off atmospheric CO2, and storing it in full, sealed containers.  If its pH were measured without exposure to air, it would be 7.0, or very close to it.",1410728383

8316202,comment,8316125,8316125,1,0,mindcrime,,,"Well said... a very poignant and moving article.  It really resonates with me, as I&#x27;m feeling a bit depressed right this moment.  The &quot;numb feeling&quot; thing is SO true.  Being depressed isn&#x27;t being sad, it&#x27;s just feeling empty, numb, disconnected.<p>The sad thing is, we haven&#x27;t even failed.  In fact, in some regards things are going really well.  We have a great opportunity to demo our products this week at the CED Tech Venture Conference, and we have some other cool stuff coming up[1]. But...  like TFA says, it&#x27;s the weight of your expectations that crush you.  And while we have some good stuff going on, we&#x27;re not where we want to be, and the road forward looks pretty bleak sometimes.  And for me personally, being on the older&#x27;ish side (41), the pressure seems amplified, since I feel like I&#x27;m running out of time to achieve things I want to achieve.<p>Lately, I think the hardest part is how I&#x27;ve been starting to doubt myself. I&#x27;ve always been pretty confident and optimistic, but something lately has me starting to look around and go &quot;Am I really good enough to do this?&quot; and &quot;why should I believe I can make this happen?&quot;, stuff like that.<p>I attribute most of it to overwork and burnout.  Working full-time, plus slaving away on the startup by night and weekend, working 100+ hour weeks over and over and over and over and over again...  and having the pressure of getting ready for this demo thing, and these upcoming talks, etc., it just wears you a bit thin.<p>I think if I make it to the end of October, I&#x27;ll be able to ease off a bit in Nov and Dec., and recover a bit.  Maybe take a brief vacation to let the batteries recharge, and then get back at it.<p>[1]: <a href=""http://fogbeam.blogspot.com/2014/09/come-meet-fogbeam-labs.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://fogbeam.blogspot.com/2014/09/come-meet-fogbeam-labs.h...</a>",1410727888

8316195,comment,8315616,8315616,2,0,computerjunkie,,,"I tried using Bootstrap and other CSS frameworks and (as mentioned in the comments) I felt like I was fighting the frameworks to get it to do what I wanted to do.<p>The problem with CSS frameworks is that they are invasive when it comes to writing semantic HTML. As someone who is working on developing semantic HTML and improving the skill, its annoying when you use a CSS framework which it encourages you to perform inline styling.<p>Layout should be <i>separated</i> from content.<p>Bootstrap and others is are great for making something quick and dirty. Semantic UI[1] is onto something decent but the issue of inline styling irritates me. Its good that Picnic is taking an approach to use better naming conventions for classes. I think this is a preference thing but I find writing <i>button-one</i> better than writing <i>btn-1</i>. I think its readable, can be understood quickly , easy to pick up if you have been away from development for a while, looks maintainable even for novice developers.<p>Shorthand has never been my thing, it just adds more complexity and nuisance by wasting time digging into someones documentation to understand whats going on. I would rather spend an extra two seconds writing out a full name rather than using shorthand knowing that its going to make my life easier in the future.<p>Great work, I&#x27;ll definitely play with this when I get time.<p>1. <a href=""http://semantic-ui.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://semantic-ui.com/</a>",1410727764

8316193,comment,8316073,8316111,2,0,greenyoda,,,"Not all developers are as good at reading other people&#x27;s code as you are. Some developers who are good at writing code from scratch are not very good at reading existing code (even code that&#x27;s not messy) - reading code is a completely different skill than writing code and requires a lot of patience and concentration. Many developers will just throw up their hands and claim the existing code must be thrown away and rewritten from scratch.<p>So, the answer to the question &quot;How hard is it for a qualified developer to take up an existing project with messy code?&quot; is:\n&quot;it depends&quot;. It depends a lot on the developer&#x27;s skill at understanding and refactoring code. It depends on how messy the code base actually is. It depends on whether the original application had any unit tests. It depends on the complexity of the application. It depends on how well you can explain to the developer what the original version of the code was actually supposed to do.",1410727676

That means that Li+ concentration of 0.17 mg/L is ~1/160 of a minimal therapeutic dose.<p>As a drug Li carbonate comes in 300 and 450 mg doses.  Dosing is determined by monitoring the blood level of Li since only a narrow range of levels represent optimal therapeutic effect, and above that range toxicity can develop.<p>There is no &quot;standard&quot; dose of Li.  It&#x27;s necessary to start at lowest dose and increase gradually while monitoring the blood level.  While 900-1200 mg/day is common, there are many individuals who need lower or higher dosage to have measured Li levels fall within acceptable limits.<p>Occasionally 300 mg/day is sufficient to get a good level, so that&#x27;s the reason I used it for estimating the ratio of the natural vs. medicinal Li intake.",1410727507

8316124,comment,8315860,8315860,3,0,gbelote,,,"To give you an embarrassing personal anecdote: In my first startup I wanted to do customer development. The lean startup was a fresh and growingly popular idea, and we devoted more time and energy talking to potential customers than turning our proof-of-concept prototype into an MVP. It looked smart on paper. Unfortunately that didn&#x27;t go so well and my conclusion was that we were doing customer development wrong. So we tried to do customer development &quot;better&quot; instead of pivot.<p>I was so mentally set in my idea that I consistently gravitated to the next-simplest explanation when I encountered sad evidence. And even though I believed I was being smart and understood customer development, I was following a checklist of things I thought I was supposed to do and was confused when we stagnated. I pretty much was asking to learn my lesson the hard way. :)<p>It seems very plausible that new products and services can be built to help founders be more effective at customer development. However one major obstacle if you outsource customer development too much will be dodging bullets as the messenger.<p>If I had used a CD service I&#x27;d probably assume the person was doing it wrong. They don&#x27;t get my product, they are bad at sales, they aren&#x27;t finding the right customers, etc. And then I&#x27;d wonder why I was throwing away my money (out of my personal pocket) for a service that wasn&#x27;t &quot;working&quot;. Unless you&#x27;re a customer development superhero there might even be a little truth in all those things – it&#x27;s going to take you a while to orient to the company&#x27;s vision and market.<p>Another issue is that you&#x27;ll probably see adverse selection from your clients. Folks who are good at customer development or stumble into promising early traction probably aren&#x27;t going to hire a consultant for that stuff. So you&#x27;re going to get people who either have an aversion to talking to customers and/or have hit a wall finding customers. And it&#x27;s quite possible that the stuff you&#x27;ll try is very similar to the stuff they tried and failed. So most of your clients might be biased towards failed startups, which may create a lot of churn and make it harder to gain inbound leads.",1410725981

It has a couple of &quot;rules&quot; you can change out that will fix the exponential problem for some cases, only to introduce new problematic cases elsewhere. However the reality is that it demonstrates polynomial-like performance on almost all problems of interest, and that is why it is so widely used.<p>Later, interior point methods arose that can be faster sometimes (and are polynomial time complexity), but they didn&#x27;t kill the simplex method. This is partly due to one key property of the simplex method: at optimality, you can change the linear program in many different small ways and start the algorithm again from where you left off (sometimes you need the dual simplex method, a sibling method). You&#x27;ll return to feasible optimality in usually only a few iterations. This is what powers the branch-and-bound approach to integer programming, which is the really useful application of LP these days. Interior point methods don&#x27;t really have good warm starts to this day, certainly not good enough for branch-and-bound.<p>I&#x27;ve met several professors who kinda don&#x27;t like the simplex method because (they say) it is not a beautiful algorithm from a theory perspective, but I think its wonderful.<p>Oh, and PSA: very difficult to implement correctly!

PROTO would then build further on the first two, further refining all the improvements made along the way, to provide a template for building commercially viable fusion power stations.<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DEMO"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DEMO</a>",1410725277

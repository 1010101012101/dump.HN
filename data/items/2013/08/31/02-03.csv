We found that the same farmer shows diminished cognitive performance before harvest, when poor, as compared with after harvest, when rich. This cannot be explained by differences in time available, nutrition, or work effort...Instead, it appears that poverty itself reduces cognitive capacity.&quot;<p><a href=""http://www.sciencemag.org/content/341/6149/976.abstract"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.sciencemag.org/content/341/6149/976.abstract</a><p>Buying or not buying a soda seems like a plausible example arithmetically, but in practice any personal budget that does not include a few small luxuries is not a personal budget that anyone is going to follow. If it&#x27;s not a soda it&#x27;s going to be a magazine or something else eventually.<p>Anyway, even if we concede arguendo that those now presently in poverty got there by being stupid and drinking soda they couldn&#x27;t afford or not finding cheaper lodgings etc., if we somehow removed bad decision makers from the population it wouldn&#x27;t mean an end to poverty. It would just mean good decision makers would find themselves in poverty. That&#x27;s because we need at least 5% unemployment to keep inflation at bay, with some number above that underemployed and some number below that dropping out of the workforce entirely. While those states could theoretically be transitory for everyone, in practice they&#x27;re going to be sticky for a large number. So even in a population of 100% good decision makers you&#x27;re still going to have some poverty just so the central banks don&#x27;t run up against NAIRU.<p>And then, if this paper is correct, those new poor are also going to start having a hard time with congnitive tasks.",1377917631

6305507,comment,6302203,6302203,2,0,todd8,,,"Jeff Atwood writes that his new CODE keyboard is &quot;the first truly great mechanical keyboard&quot;.  Xah Lee takes issue with this in his review of the CODE keyboard, and in my opinion Xah makes some good points.  First, comparable  mechanical keyboards are already available at a lower price point.  (For example, I own the CM STORM QUICKFIRE mentioned in Xah Lee&#x27;s review; it&#x27;s available from Amazon for less than half the price of the CODE keyboard.  It has Cherry Blue switches.)  The CODE keyboard looks like a solid keyboard, but is it worth paying double for essentially the same features?  The Cherry Clear switches of the CODE keyboard are hard to find, but do they justify the price for a keyboard that otherwise seems \nrather ordinary.  The second point that Xah makes is that the CODE keyboard doesn&#x27;t have a design that addresses many of the historical deficits in standard keyboards.<p>The CODE keyboard has a traditional layout.  I agree with Xah here that the CODE isn&#x27;t an improvement over traditional designs and falls short of the more innovative attempts to improve keyboards.  I&#x27;ve been programming for over 45 years, and I&#x27;m disappointed that most keyboards, like the CODE, aren&#x27;t much better than one&#x27;s I used decades ago.<p>I&#x27;m surprised by the comments that dismiss Xah as a troll.  It&#x27;s true that Xah (particularly in some of his older blog postings) can be provocative, but I don&#x27;t consider his review trolling.  Look at the keyboard link at the top of Xah&#x27;s review: <a href=""http://xahlee.info/kbd/keyboarding.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://xahlee.info/kbd/keyboarding.html</a>.  It leads to a page of well over a hundred links to Xah&#x27;s blogs on keyboards!  Page after page of his thoughts on keyboards, his experiences with keyboards, instructions on how to remap keys, pictures of obscure keyboards, how to configure emacs keys, how to learn Dvorak, how to improve one&#x27;s typing, the frequency of keys used when programming.  It just goes on and on.  If you are interested in keyboards it&#x27;s fascinating, even if some of it is based on personal opinion. I don&#x27;t know anyone that has written as much on keyboards as Xah.  If you think he is a troll, at least check out the research and thought he has put into the subject--it might change your mind.<p>The CODE keyboard looks like it will have good construction and be backed by a good company;  the standard layout will make it easy to learn to use.  I&#x27;ve looked at keyboards from WASD and considered buying one of their keyboards because they look like they are well made.  However, to me, there are shortcomings with any traditional design.<p>The Cherry Clear switches may have too heavy a feel for me.  I&#x27;ve never used them but it concerns me that they aren&#x27;t very popular.<p>The spacebar is too long.  A split-space bar is better (if one side can be remapped) because it allows the backspace key to be hit by one thumb and the space with the other.<p>The important modifier keys are more difficult to use when they are under the [Z/X] and the [,/.] positions.  Some keyboards position Alt or Command keys so they can be pressed with the thumbs while typing without moving the hands off the home row.  On the CODE keyboard only the Control modifier (remapped to the Caps Lock position) can be pressed easily without awkward hand movements.<p>There are no extra keys; there isn&#x27;t even a MENU key if it is remapped to a FUNC key so that multimedia keys are available.<p>For a keyboard being sold to coders, the ESC key is too far away. I have tried alternatives to ESC when using vim (chords, etc.), but weird customizations require extra software or configuration and are never around on coworkers keyboards.<p>Matrix key arrangements, where keys for each finger are directly above one another instead of being arranged on diagonals, really do help my coding. Some keyboards with matrix layouts are the Ergodox, the Truly Ergonomic Computer Keyboard (TECK), the TypeMatrix, the Kinesis Advantage, and the Maltron. I don&#x27;t really type any faster on these layouts, but I&#x27;m much more accurate in touch-typing the symbols and numbers that come up frequently while programming.<p>While reading Xah Lee&#x27;s blog I learned about the TECK.  It is now my favorite keyboard, it has solid construction, uses Cherry Brown switches and seems to provide the right balance of ergonomics and ease of learning. (It works perfectly on my Mac.) It&#x27;s great for an Emacs user. The only problem I have is that it takes a brief period to switch between it and my laptop keyboard.",1377917091

The first is the psychological evidence that sending men with guns to drag children away from a family where they are safe and loved is <i>hugely</i> damaging. So much so that it is highly unlikely to be worth it, even if you think homeschooling is bad.<p>The second is the evidence that home-schooled students do not underperform other children by any measurable standards, and are frequently found to outperform. This includes both academics and general success/happiness later in life. They are also no more likely to engage in anti-social behaviors. Which begs the question: what is the state&#x27;s compelling interest, if there is zero evidence for damage to the children or to society at large?<p>Obviously it&#x27;s not really about protecting children.

One notices that there was that other German couple, whose name eludes me, who cited religious motives for homeschooling.  That is never a good sign.  I&#x27;m a practicing Catholic, and if a German gives that reason for homeschooling they are using the Lord&#x27;s name in vain.<p>Public opinion in Germany (and in France) is that society has a duty to provide some oversight, and that that is provided by schools.  By the way, public education in Germany is generally decent.<p>All these arguments aside, there is also the child&#x27;s right to a decent education, and the parents have no right at all to deprive the child of that.",1377915867

How does a decision to allow or not allow same-sex marriage play into that?  Usually the &quot;it&#x27;s a human right&quot; crowd skips over that first question, which is my reason for discussing it.  But not believing that it is a globally applicable human right does not necessarily determine the issue in a specific culture such as our own.<p>The same exists for due process rights.  The due process right exists to ensure that government can&#x27;t arbitrarily screw with your life because they don&#x27;t like you.  They can&#x27;t throw you in jail, take your stuff, or the like.  The question is how much putting you on a no fly list affects rights which are functionally necessary in our society.  For this I think you have to look at the most intrusive implications, not the least.  My point is that same-sex marriage is a very different situation where the normal retirement plan is to retire with one&#x27;s children than in a society such as ours (I am an American though I am in Indonesia, so &quot;ours&quot; refers to American) where we expect pensions to be the primary support for the elderly.<p>In other words, &quot;you can&#x27;t fly from Bozeman to Sea-Tac&quot; is not a real problem.  It might take a day longer, but you can take a bus.  &quot;You can&#x27;t fly from Honolulu to San Francisco&quot; has very different implications.  A no-fly list can&#x27;t be effective if it distinguishes between these, and quite frankly after 9/11 a the latter flight is more problematic than the former.  We know that there is a right to travel internationally and between the States.  There are States that a no-fly list makes inaccessible to travellers directly, so therefore it violates that basic right which is a necessity regarding our system of federalism.  Moreover, because some states are rendered inaccessible to those on no-fly lists, this also violates the basic equality of the states.<p>So I think there are a lot of issues here, but I tend to want to see more to &quot;it&#x27;s a right&quot; than &quot;because I think that would be a good idea.&quot;  I think rights must be functional, because otherwise they are mere articles of faith.",1377914925

So a model that allows you to defer conflict merges, and to do the merge on any peer, keeps the database doing what it does best, and gives maximum flexibility to the application.<p>For instance on a customer record you might have three sales folks all qualify a lead as a 4, one adds a fax number, one adds an email address, and one adds the same fax but a different email, and a note about the best time to call. If the database forced the application to merge on encountering each update, there&#x27;d never be a chance to set all three versions side by side and make an informed comparison. Instead it would be luck that A and B merge, and then the result merges with C. Or some other order.<p>Where it gets really useful is if you have different actors that have ownership of the merge on different fields. So for instance you could partially resolve the conflict by merging some fields automatically but present a human with the full set of options for a bigger octopus merge on, say, the notes field.",1377914905

6305387,comment,6304771,6304771,3,0,7Figures2Commas,,,"While there are certainly companies that will not give bonus points for having once pursued an entrepreneurial path, I don&#x27;t think entrepreneurship in and of itself is generally as problematic as it&#x27;s made out to be here.<p>Constructive criticism: I think the author&#x27;s difficulties are probably more about his overall positioning than his history of entrepreneurial pursuits. For better or worse, positioning can mean the difference between getting lots of job offers and getting none.<p>The first thing I noticed in looking at the author&#x27;s LinkedIn profile, which is the first result when you Google his name, is that it tells me more about what he&#x27;s done than what he has actually accomplished. That&#x27;s not helpful because prospective employers don&#x27;t just want to know where you&#x27;ve worked, they want to know what you&#x27;ve achieved. If I were the author, I would rewrite my job descriptions to focus on the tangible benefits realized by my contributions. Right now, I can&#x27;t figure out what value the author has created for his companies/clients/employers because it&#x27;s simply not described.<p>Also, certain red flags simply aren&#x27;t likely to be overlooked. Examples of these red flags include:<p>1. <i>No</i> full-time roles.<p>2. A history of job hopping (i.e. most/lots of stints under 18-24 months)<p>3. Jobs with overlapping dates.<p>4. Unexplained gaps in employment history.<p>5. No discernible career &quot;path&quot; (i.e. being all over the place in terms of what you&#x27;ve done).<p>6. Lots of moving around (geographically).<p>7. Bizarre job titles.<p>8. Job title progression that is inconsistent with a traditional development path (i.e. a jump from an entry-level job title to a senior-level job title in less than a year is likely going to be questioned).<p>9. Public musings in which you paint yourself as financially strained, burnt out, confused, etc.<p>Obviously, you can not and should not lie about your work history, so when these sorts of red flags exist, there might not be an easy way to deal with them. But I don&#x27;t get the impression that the author has really looked at his CV and made an effort to argue compellingly that he brings a lot to the table. So blaming his entrepreneurial past for his failure to find a job is, in my opinion, misguided.<p>Finally, the author can&#x27;t expect a good outcome if he&#x27;s not where the jobs he&#x27;s interested in are. If, say, I was interested in meeting the author for lunch next week to discuss a job opening, I would be unable to do so because he&#x27;s in Thailand.

6305385,comment,6302276,6304470,4,0,Jongseong,,,"The simple description you&#x27;ll find in most linguistic descriptions of Japanese is that the Japanese r is what is called an alveolar tap and written as [] in the International Phonetic Alphabet, which is also the Spanish r in <i>pero</i> (not the trilled r in <i>perro</i>). The reality is more complicated because Japanese only has one liquid phoneme. The fact that there is no separate l sound in Japanese means that there is a bigger phonetic space that the r sound can occupy. What ends up happening is that the Japanese r can be lateralized, that is, part of the airstream is through the sides of the tongue rather than through the middle of the mouth. A lateralized tap which results in this case is written as []. This ends up sounding like l, which is technically known as a lateral approximant because the airstream is only through the sides of the tongue.<p>The more complete description of the Japanese r is that it is a tapped alveolar consonant that can range between a completely central [] and the lateralized [], with different degrees of lateralization. All will be interpreted as the Japanese r, and speakers tend to use [] after vowels, with lateralization likely to creep in if the r comes at the beginning of an utterance or after an n.<p>I&#x27;m a native speaker of Korean by the way, and while at the abstract phonemic level we also have a single l/r sound represented as  in the Korean alphabet, we do distinguish [] and [l] between vowels.  <i>ari</i> uses the tap [] and  <i>alli</i> uses [l] because that&#x27;s how double  is pronounced. It&#x27;s a similar distribution to the tapped and trilled r&#x27;s in Spanish, where trilled r&#x27;s between vowels can be analyzed as double r&#x27;s.",1377914755

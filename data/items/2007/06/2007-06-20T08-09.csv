I don't recall seeing this too often.<p>Would they have survived a presentation-ware duel with Google or would they have suffered a fate similar to Kiko's?<p>I can't remember when I first heard about Zenter but it seems like I've been anticipating its release for a while. We generally hear that it's good to release early and update often so I'm interested in the story behind all of this.<p>Would it have been better for them to hold out and build a user base so they could be acquired for more money?",1182328627

29469,comment,29098,29233,0,0,davidw,,,"I respectfully disagree. Consider that:<p>- People are risk averse.<p>- Most hackers make pretty good money at 'real jobs'.<p>- Startups are definitely a risky proposition.  As someone else commented, ""A startup founder with a successful startup is already a rare exception."".<p>- So when you're in the thick of it, and there isn't a lot of money, and you don't know if it's going to go anywhere, that reality is going to wipe out any talk of ""we might be rich"", compared with the alternative of ""making pretty good money and living comfortably"".<p>The ""this is what makes me happy, how can we both make it work""  is the approach that has best worked for me.  My wife likes coming home and finding that I'm so much happier than when I was working for a moron, even if there's no money in it (yet).",1182327507

I'd equate this with google not paying attention to ordering of results! Creating a threaded comment system <i>without</i> the ordering is so mind numbingly easy and digg decided to take the easy path without paying attention to the details that count.<p>I was tempted to post this where the creators of digg can see it, but I don't really want them to realize their error:)",1182327472

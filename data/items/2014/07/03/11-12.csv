It seems that cro-magnon man were likely an early sub-species or tribe which settled across northern Africa, as far out as the Azores, and along what&#x27;s now the Spanish-France border region.  All of which now show similar linguistic roots.

My case isn&#x27;t typical, I live on a boat in Europe. She has panels which could push 5-6kWh/day on average in summer (they don&#x27;t because our batteries are full long before that), but only 1kWh/day in december. We need 2-3kWh/day to be comfortable. So, we need more than what PV panels provides exactly when we also need to heat the boat, so a cost-effective CHP solution would be great.<p>Also, I&#x27;d like this to run on wood pellets, or diesel fuel: replacing the electrical grid with the natural gaz one is a bad idea, especielly considering that the expected yield of non-conventional extraction methods is continuously and rapidly adjusted down.",1404388681

The notion that the internet would be somehow better if clueless people weren&#x27;t able to use it is ridiculous. Arguably the fact that AOL (and others) lowered the intellectual barriers to entry by taking an exceptionally complicated system and making it easy to understand was just a forerunner to today&#x27;s UX revolution - taking complex, and consequently expensive, products and services and making them trivially easy to use is the USP of many, many start-ups.

That is, on a cost-of-electricity basis it&#x27;s a wash.<p>Mind:  gas delivery networks likely would crumble (hopefully not literally) under the increased demand.<p>Depending on system costs, this could be viable as a back-up power generation option (blackouts, etc.), where electrical service might fail but the gas supply would still work.<p>Capturing and making use of waste heat could indeed be useful.  I see the possibility of full grid independence as very slim, and not particularly compelling (with distributed small, renewable, and intermittent generation, the grid is a useful way to move surpluses and deficits around).  Though being somewhat immune to major grid disruptions is a possibility.<p>I&#x27;d also keep an eye on natural gas trends.  Supplies aren&#x27;t endless, though the US EIA&#x27;s estimates suggest a reference resource case of increasing extraction through 2040 at least, the less optimistic low resource case suggesting a peak by 2030.  With fracked <i>oil</i> extraction very  likely to peak before 2020, a transfer of fuel and energy uses onto natural gas will change market dynamics considerably.

This got me thinking what makes it difficult.<p>It&#x27;s probably not difficult in the same way running a marathon is. It&#x27;s not the sort of thing you could treat with willpower and discipline alone. What makes it difficult is how <i>convinced</i> you are you shouldn&#x27;t change your mind. You think your current opinions are correct. But besides yourself being mistaken without realizing it, you are also convinced other people -- the ones trying to help change your mind -- are mistaken too. You don&#x27;t even entertain a contradictory thought. You are being relentless but with only the bad parts.<p>If you wanted to change your mind then, how would you do it?<p>How would you collide your misconceptions with those of others and come away a better person? And how can you do that as systematically as you train for a marathon?<p>The surprising thing is it feels like something that requires loose shamelessness than strict discipline. You have to admit, as often as possible, that you don&#x27;t have the answers. A weak willpower appears to get you further here since you don&#x27;t fight each counterargument to what you thought you knew.<p>What do <i>you</i>, personally, do right now to change your mind? Have you discovered tricks that help? Do some tricks work better than others?<p>Is there a process to the madness?<p>[1] - https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7895364",1404387490

So dividing 10 kW by 30% will give you the rough energy input.  Casting that in therms/hr. (usual natural gas billing unit in the US is therms), it&#x27;s about 1.14.  Residential price is on the order of around $0.80 - $1.50/therm, so you&#x27;re looking at about $25/day for 10 kW of continuous power.  Which isn&#x27;t far from what you&#x27;d be paying for electricity:  $21 - 29 at $0.09 - $0.12 per kWh.<p>In terms of volume, 1 ft^3 is about 1025 btu, a therm is 10,000 btu, so you&#x27;re looking at 97.5, let&#x27;s call it 100 ft^3 of natural gas consumption per day.<p>As for running a Stirling engine on solar energy, or another heat source, yes, you could do that.  Again, you need 33 kW of input power, which means a 33m^3 collecter surface -- that&#x27;s 5.8m on a side, or 19 feet.<p>Because the Stirling&#x27;s hot end is a point, you&#x27;d need tracking systems or a working fluid to deliver heat to it from your mirrors.<p>Incidentally, you can answer a lot of these questions using GNU units, written by Adrian Mariano.  The great thing about it is conversion between different units and relationships, e.g., energy per hour per unit area.

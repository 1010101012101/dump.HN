You may have inferred causation where there is merely correlation: I find it all too likely that the impulses that drive one to take up meditation are the same ones that drive one to consider 'life'... and suffer the consequences of those considerations.

2126597,comment,2125115,2125115,0,0,initself,,,"I meditate in the tradition of Vipassana meditation as taught by S.N. Goenka: <a href=""http://www.dhamma.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.dhamma.org/</a><p>One can take a 10 day course at many centers around the world to learn the technique from qualified teachers in its purity.<p>I knew about Vipassana for a long time but I did not attend a 10 day course until I was completely at rock bottom suffering from depression.  Once I learned the technique, experiencing reality as-it-is for the first time in my life, it changed me fundamentally from the inside out.  It was there that I found out that the results of my poor actions in this lifetime (and possibly others) were stored within my physical body and that I could remove them via observing them objectively without reacting to the sensations that came up via this observation.  Having that direct realization meant that I could never go back to the ignorance of not being aware of how the law of karma has direct results upon one's experience of life.  After the course had finished, I continued practicing Vipassana morning and evening for one hour each sitting for many months/years and continue to experience profound benefits.<p>I am much less angry and much more calm, much more adept at handling life's inevitable challenges.  When I do find myself reacting strongly to certain situations, I am able to witness my reactions objectively and thereby reduce their negative effects swiftly.  Emotions disturbances that used to persist for weeks are now gone in minutes.<p>I am happy and grounded in the knowledge that I have within my possession a technique to control my mind.  That is a very liberating knowledge and worth pursuing for one's self!",1295589438

This means that you'll probably not be able to run your Azure application in AppHarbor without modifications. This is not due to special requirements for AppHarbor, but because Azure requires special code. On the other hand, you are able to create a template ASP.NET MVC application and push it directly.<p>Another thing is that we will never provide the full range of Microsoft solutions. Microsoft already does that. Our edge is that we can offer more than just Microsoft products, and as we're running in EC2, there's a whole range of providers offering additional value as well.\nFor instance, we're going to support memcached, because it's industry standard. Microsoft will support Velocity, because that's what they make. I think this is a substantial and important difference.<p>To sum it up, we're going to support file storage, message queues and what you need to build a scalable web application.

2126586,comment,2125587,2126356,0,0,adrianwaj,,,"Doing a search will have the top results being pages that friends, or friends of friends have linked to, or retweeted.<p>In the results window you'll see what they said about it. You'll then have the opportunity to contact those people (if they've got that setting on) - and in time, you'll get new friend recommendations based on what you're searching and clicking: so social search leads to search-based matchmaking. It could also lead to interest groups, especially location-based interest groups from a bunch of people in similar social circles, thereby leading to meetups.<p>You could also put out requests for help, and those requests for help will be distributed to the right friends (by way of what they've been searching for lately), so they can respond.<p>FB can feed their timelines into Bing (or their own search engine) so Bing can go grab content in realtime as it's linked, rather than take the shotgun approach spidering. And then FB would harness that system.<p>So basically social search gives a better picture on an individual's interests, and how recent, or how long that interest has been to a person. This where Google really needs to catchup: they should really see themselves as a tiny startup against massive FB. They should see their users as individuals amongst a group of friends, rather than as silos with intentions. They should hire FB engineers, look to their own ranks for FB power users, maybe even find some people who Zuckerberg has pissed off to help.",1295588925

Why does the iPhone screen read ""Lewis Direct""?<p>The text links at the top (""Home"", ""Social"", ""Website"", ""Mobile"") aren't spaced far enough apart for me to parse them as different links. Coupled with the ""Web Social Mobile Monetize"" text in the header graphic they create an overwhelming impression of jargon which dissuades me from wanting to read the actual text. You could probably link to most of those pages from a single ""about us"" page and keep the main page cleaner and your signup funnel more focused.<p>Nobody reads these days, so I think having such a mass of text is a bad idea front and center. The stronger bits of the page are further down. Unfortunately, everything below the green bar rolls offscreen on my 13 inch Macbook, so the immediate impression is simply of a lot of text in a fairly unreadable color scheme. The strongest explanation you have is (""Web + Blog + Social"") imho, although you might want to double-check that the wording resonates with your target market -- people might be very clear that they want a website rather than a blog and calling your system a blog might put them off.<p>Most powerful inducement to checking out the CMS would probably be seeing it in action.

Google is a search arbitrageur: they have a large source of searches which they can acquire cheaply, a large number of pages with content which is not quite responsive to user needs, and advertisers who are willing to pay for targeted traffic.

I just have a clear sight of everything happening, the solution to problems are always obvious. This is a great feeling and this is why i enjoy and i encourage you to meditate.\nWhat to do is simple, there is plenty of meditation you can find on the web. Just find one you like and do it. Do it a lot like for 2 years and master it. Once you master it, it will be natural for you to get this state of mind, this lucidity, even when you are not meditating.",1295586515

It swings both ways - for every ""amoral"" customer you get claiming a warranty replacement, you'll have another ""moral"" customer getting short shrift from Apple (or company X) in terms of legitimate warranties not being honoured in a timely fashion or not following up on promises. When it actually comes to needing support, a lot of people find that Apple's slick sell doesn't flow into support - you take your chances and sometimes it really sucks.<p>""$500-$1100 SSD upgrade""<p>That's quite a tarry brush you're carrying there.

Regardless, you're intentionally picking the worst possible case to make your point.<p>What about this situation: The bottom end mac pro comes with a 250GB drive (and you can't get a 500GB one). Upgrading to a 500GB drive costs less than $100 for the parts if you buy your own drive ($89 near me). Or 750GB/1TB for $115/$185? That's a decent upgrade for you computer, and it's not ridiculously expensive like you make out.<p>I don't have a problem with countermeasures like water sensors, but to defend them by saying things like ""what's the problem with buying a special screwdriver since anyone who's going to do so is going to install the most expensive SSD they can possibly find!"" is just straight out apologism.",1295586506

Google will hold the remaining 20% for 60 days to cover refunds before sending the rest.</i><p>This is a pretty significant piece of the news. With groupon famous for its slow payment terms, 3 day terms may look very attractive. Cash flow management is a big portion of running many small/local businesses and with most of their vendor terms from 7-30 days the 30+ day delivery from groupon can turn a big success into a big problem. This sounds like a great sales differentiator for them.<p>Even if google doesn't get significant traction out of the gate, if this forces groupon to abandon their aggressive floats it could have a real effect on how good their financials look leading up to an IPO.<p>Imagine if Google was willing to take a significantly lower revenue share on the deals to gain market share. A big reason everyone is so breathless about the business model is how crazy the margins are. If google was willing to throw a significant amount of the $6B offer price at a promotional pricing structure they could seriously slow down the rate that the competition expanded markets.",1295586155

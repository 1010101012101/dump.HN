So when you choose your desired vocation before university you may be more likely to apply your excellent skillset to teaching rather than something else, as that's what you want to do and are suited for, and you'll probably earn close to everyone else anyway.<p>In some other countries, you may try to get in to law/medicine/business first, and use teaching as a fallback as it is much lower paid. The net result is that teaching can be seen as a second choice profession and not valued as highly socially. Saying ""I'm a teacher"" at the barbeque sends a signal that you maybe didn't do so well at school as you wanted, and got your second choice at uni.<p>I know of a couple of data points where this is true in Aus (and also where it is not), but I don't know if it is really widespread.

Yes, it is misleading, but such is the way of language growth: when transferring concepts from one language to another, sometimes meaning is permanently mutated or lost.<p>Consider French ""journée"" and English ""journey"". The English word is a direct loanword from French, but in French it means ""day"" or ""a day's work"" and in English it means ""a set amount of travelling"". The etymology is fairly natural, but the English word only captures a fragment of the French meaning.<p>I think the analogy applies to monads as well: the word denotes/connotes something significantly different in Haskell than in mathematics. It's just the way it is.

Do you understand first-class functions (lambdas)? If you've got those concepts down, you can understand monads.<p>Monads are the name for a particular member of a forth level on that three-level stack of abstractions (call them type classes, as that's what Haskell calls them (though I'm fudging a little here)); a type class is a particular shape for a generic type, in the same way that any given generic type is a particular shape for a class, and a class is a particular shape for an instance.<p>So when people talk about Option/Maybe being a monad, they mean Option/Maybe is a generic type (i.e. a type constructor) which has a certain shape - i.e. has a particular set of methods / functions defined on it.<p>That's the abstraction level of monads out of the way. The next thing to understand is the particular operations required. Monads are like containers for values, but rather than operating on the values directly (e.g. y = f(x)), you instead pass the monad the function you'd like <i>it</i> to apply to the value (e.g. y = x.bind(f)), and it returns you a monad which is logically the wrapper that function applied to its contents.<p>Because the application of the function to the value inside the monad is delegated to the monad itself, it gets to decide what to do with it. In the case of Option/Maybe, it'll only apply the function if the contents aren't empty. In the case of IO, it'll logically buffer up a list of imperative I/O operations which will be logically returned as a result of the main function; and that list of imperative instructions will then be imperatively executed, after the nice and pure Haskell program has finished its unpolluted existence. (That's how it happens logically (assuming there are no cheats available in the language), but not necessarily actually.)",1293597063

The discipline of mathematics has a lot of prestige, especially in the programming community. By making use of mathematical concepts and vocabulary, Haskell has acquired a reputation as being particularly elegant and sharing in the conceptual beauty of very abstract mathematics. I struggle to understand category theory, and I struggle to understand Haskell, and I always assumed that my difficulty in precisely mapping concepts like monads between the two were because I just wasn't smart enough. (That is almost certainly the case regardless!) If thinking about the formal definition of monads isn't helpful when learning Haskell programming, is the use of mathematical terminology misleading?",1293597013

Whilst in North America it is almost literally still used for its original meaning as a Holy-day - with vacation denoting the chiefly British usage of holiday.<p>So why, in the US when Holiday is virtually still a contraction of Holy day are they not simply using the days name, when they use every other holidays name including other days of religious origin.<p>I believe the death/martyrdom and ressurection of Christ on Easter weekend is likely to be a more offensive holiday to bring up in the presence of Jews than his birth.

It does this while <i>not</i> actually securing end-user DNS queries, which themselves (his point, not mine) <i>aren't</i> what users need secured.<p>* Prior attempts to secure the Internet with crypto protocols have failed in predictable ways, ranging from TCPcrypt's ""try to encrypt without authenticating"" to DNSSEC's ""try to authenticate without encrypting"" to everything's ""try to secure the Internet with stuff that takes a million lines of code just to express the crypto in"" to ""standardize protocols with crypto mechanisms that real cryptographers have declared off limits over a decade earlier"".<p>* Your conception of the speed of public-key crypto is warped by how slow SSL is; 256 bit elliptic curve crypto, which hasn't degraded in security for almost 25 years, is so fast that you can rekey 10 million sessions every 10 minutes on standard PC hardware.<p>* That being the case, there's no excuse not to bake fast modern crypto into HTTP so that it's simply always there; Bernstein has created a TCP-friendly alternate transport protocol that does exactly this.<p>* It's a bad idea to have individual trusted roots, whether they're SSL CA's or DNS roots.

When people get in positions that are ostensibly powerful, they more often than not cherish their position of power, and things that seem to trivialize that power, like hands-off delegation or allowing real flexibility, are not seen as pleasing, even if they produce better results in the long run. In many cases, even if you have someone in control of a certain group who is not threatened by proper management, his boss or his boss's boss will find such a style of governance ridiculous and think that the good manager is slacking off all day because he's not nitpicking or ordering around his employees, because the boss or the boss's boss is one of the people described earlier.<p>I once worked for a great manager who was canned after eight months because his boss couldn't understand non-egocentric management techniques.<p>Management consultants don't sell this advice because management consultants don't make money by producing good managers, they make money by making their clients happy and getting referrals, and advice like 3 and 4 does not please very many ""powerful"" people.",1293595322

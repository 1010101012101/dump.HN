10286229,comment,10284299,10284299,0,0,mbubb,,,"I recently migrated jira/ Confluence / Stash / Hipchat from the cloud versions to self hosted for a company going through the IPO process.<p>So we went from the Crowd based setup to LDAP / postgresql backed versions of the products. The big surprise for me is how divergent the products are. User setup and the cross application links are so different. The underlying postgres schemas are different. So the migrations were fundimentally different. (In hipchat&#x27;s case it is understandable as the self hosted version of the softwre was new and somewhat beta)<p>It reminded me of how back in the 90s I heard that Microsoft kept the developers of different products in the Office suite apart.<p>Thus when you go to link the applications together you get weird redundancies and it all doesnt work as it should. Partly that is because the licensing is so separate. Atlassian support was pretty good in that they worked with us on it and also they provided unofficial scripts to help withthe process. They also recommended using Crowd to manage users which to my mind only added a layer of complexity - you should be able to add users directly from LDAP.<p>I ended up enjoying the migration project because I got to work with postgres which is great software.<p>Atlassian is bloated and in my opinion they havent worked on cross application connectivity enough. It should be seamless.<p>My company (at the time) ended up hiring a fulltime person to manage the complexity (ie an Atlassian admin) plus a few consultants to get the workflow stuff down.<p>It is good when you have jira and confluence running well - but it takes a lot of time and money to get to that point.",1443355148

On a tangential note, it would help if the names for mathematical terms were in English, rather than some weird amalgamation of Greek, Latin, French and German. In my language, all n-gons are called n-anguloids. So you have threeanguloid, fouranguloid, fiveanguloid, &quot;a proper N-anguloid&quot;, etc... And we use the normal names for numbers, rather than Greek ones. And a rectangle is &quot;right-angle-oid&quot; (granted, that&#x27;s the name in English too, if you squint a bit and know what phonetic shifts to look for and your German is good). Square is quadrat, though. Then again, it&#x27;s still an everyday word, even if we borrowed it from Greek millennia ago. And the word for &quot;perimeter&quot; also means &quot;a walk around&quot; and &quot;a lap&quot;. You literally tell people &quot;the length of the lap of a rightanguloid is the sum of the four sides&quot;, which is kind of obvious if you imagine walking the perimeter.

Every attempt at a discussion has always ended up without her actually trying to listen and heaping on (berating) criticism that is either coming from her own shortcomings/fears (and she&#x27;s a very fearful person) or she&#x27;ll interrupt me and heap on criticism based on what she thinks I&#x27;m going to say. At least that&#x27;s how it&#x27;s been since I was too big for her to continue to beat me.<p>There hasn&#x27;t been a shred of concern for my own interests and goals and in my 30s I don&#x27;t expect that to change from her. She&#x27;s been trying to break up my older brother&#x27;s marriage for near 20 years (after successfully driving his previous partner away and a few of mine). She wasn&#x27;t invited to my brother&#x27;s wedding and if I ever meet someone that I care about again, she will not get to meet them. Ever.<p>If I were more cynical, I would say that every time our goals aren&#x27;t lock-step with her goals for us, she makes a concerted effort for us to fail, but I imagine that she really thinks she has the best of intentions. She is just crazy.<p>So sure, love your family, but that doesn&#x27;t mean your family is good for you. If your family isn&#x27;t good for you, limit their ability to do damage in your life.

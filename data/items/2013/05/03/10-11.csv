5649642,comment,5647384,5647384,5,0,epo,,,"I find all the whining of all these armchair security experts a bit wearing. No one outside of Linode and the alleged hacker knows exactly why and how Linode was hacked so quit speculating, you are simply making things up. ""Ooh, this is a bad thing, I bet Linode did this bad thing"". For example people are suggesting that 2FA is useless if outsiders had free run of Linode's infrastructure, and so it would be. BUT, is there any evidence whatsoever that this was the case? If not then STFU and stop spreading lies. 2FA is useless against a nuclear strike, what exactly is the point of saying so? Anyone can fantasise disasters.<p>To get some positive content out of this thread. Is there a VM provider with a provably better security record than Linode?<p>If you are going to stay with Linode then 2FA seems like a no brainer. So, is there a simple way to get the 2FA iDevice systems (Google, Duo) to work on multiple devices, say to allow an iPad or an iPhone to be used interchangeably?",1367578672

5649619,comment,5648805,5648805,1,0,Kequc,,,"It seems like these trivial inconveniences could largely be avoided in non trivial broader ways. For example what is the need for having so many javascript and css assets when in Rails we are meant to use the asset pipeline by default? In this case it seems like it would make the most sense to utilize the asset pipeline, more so than most applications. Merge all those together, serving up 80 separate assets is insane. Isn't it?<p>I don't understand mapping the keyboard shortcut in Vim to reloading all browsers. Does that reload all tabs in all open browsers? What if I have a paused youtube video, or am saving my place in a large article that I am scrolled most of the way down the page. Doesn't that all take longer to fix than just going to the browser and hitting the keyboard shortcut in the browser? Since you're going to the browser anyway or else the reloading would have been meaningless?<p>The most obvious time sink that I can see from this article is that the tests are poorly optimised. But that isn't a trivial inconvenience. Having to wait 3 minutes, twice, every time you make a change in the code is a significant inconvenience. That should give plenty of time to do things such as reload a page. Designed properly tests are not meant to depend on one another just to run. Use minitest, use fixtures and fabricators. Test individual classes, test controllers, avoid full stack tests unless there is something that can't be tested about it at a lower level.<p>As others have said also Vim is a powerful tool but there isn't really very much it can do that a modern graphical text editor like Sublime Text 2 cannot... I'm sorry I am just having trouble making this article resonate with me. Is it something wrong with me or am I right?",1367577822

And the development to push low paid jobs back to the customer themselves does indeed happen, but it happens regardless.<p>Countries like Norway does not have massive unemployment by international standard, despite one of the flattest salary curves in the world.<p>>  If a business now has to pay someone, say, $10 an hour instead of $7, they will be able to get people with more experience / skill for that price, making it harder for people to get entry-level jobs in the first place.<p>This assumes the more qualified people <i>want</i> those jobs, even at $10 instead of $7.<p>If I could get a job as a cleaner for what I make as a software developer, I'd still pick the (much less physically demanding, and less soul destroying) job as a software developer.<p>If salary was even the main determinant for why people pick the jobs they do, then we'd practically have no nurses or teachers, for example - both jobs that require disproportionally long education for the often very low salaries they command.<p>Or even law.<p>In the UK, the average salary for solicitors (who require 3 or 4 years for a degree <i>plus</i> the Legal Practice Course of one year <i>plus</i> two years of practice before you become qualified) is <i>lower</i> than the national average salary.<p>You can make far more in many professions that don't require even a degree. In fact, there are people in retail and fast food jobs that make more than many UK solicitors, yet work normal hours where many solicitors work hours that are illegal in most European countries.<p>But most of the positions that are in the territory that would be affected by minimum wage restrictions tends to be positions primarily attracting the totally unqualified that are generally positions that are extremely unattractive for qualified workers and remain so for most even if the salary was better.<p>How many people do you come across that actively want to make a career for themselves working themselves up the ladder in McDonalds? Yet making manager at a McDonalds in the UK can net you 45k GBP/year or more - far above the average UK salary. Economically, a large proportion of UK solicitors, teachers, nurses and many others would be better off working at McDonalds. Yet we don't see a massive flight of highly qualified people to McDonalds or similar.",1367576194

The process is open, anybody can participate.   You don't need secret knowledge or connections to do these deals; all you need is a worthy pitch or money to come to the table.<p>You can get good terms.   That`s the point.   It`s much more difficult for investors to squeeze you; it`s also much more difficult for you to pull off a coup like the one Bill Gates did on IBM.<p>I think you`re reading the article wrong.  Not surprising given the title and our forum.   Obviously hacker news sympathizes with the entrpreneurs.<p>The title implies that the investors have won and the entrepreneurs have lost.<p>In fact, it makes a quite convincing argument that Wall Street & the traditional investment class are among the losers.  It`s saying that the big winners are Google/Facebook/Apple/Microsoft, et cetera.  They made 10's of billions.<p>The era of making 10's of billions is over.  The rest of us are part of the ""new middle class"".  But it seems that the ""new middle class"" consists of those who are either pulling in salaries over $150K working for the winners or those who make millions through aqui-hires, fairly priced venture deals or bootstrapped ""lifestyle"" companies.   Sounds good to me.<p>Another thing that sounds good to me is the decline of the ""entrepreneur as scoundrel"".   Bill Gates made 50 billion by exploiting information asymmetry.

8077385,comment,8074875,8075692,3,0,yellowapple,,,"Having read the various slides on why libressl is deemed necessary, it makes quite a bit of sense.  A large chunk of OpenSSL&#x27;s API has no business existing in the first place, let alone in a public scope, because said chunk consists mostly of redundant and half-baked implementations of things that exist in the operating system and/or external libraries.<p>OpenSSL took a rather strange approach of &quot;hey, $some_obscure_operating_system doesn&#x27;t provide $some_critical_system_function, so let&#x27;s implement it ourselves and <i>activate it for every single platform that OpenSSL is used on regardless of whether or not there&#x27;s an existing equivalent</i>&quot;.  In many cases, these sorts of shenanigans are the source of various bugs or - just as horribly - the reason why so many bugs had been undetectable via stricter memory access requirements and debugging techniques (the latter being what&#x27;s referred to when the phrase &quot;exploit mitigation countermeasure&quot; is used in the context of OpenSSL).<p>Ted could probably be a bit more helpful by providing a link to the &quot;fucking stupid[ity]&quot; that is OpenSSL&#x27;s bass-ackwards API, but most of this is already explained in prior announcements about libressl&#x27;s improvements/development and such, so it&#x27;s understandable why he didn&#x27;t feel the need to provide links for context.",1406156248

Britain already had variable length area codes and numbers, so it wasn&#x27;t as disruptive.  (I was very amused to find one place where the area code was longer than the number!)<p>The US & Canada had far more companies, plus NANPA 3/7 format being hard coded <i>everywhere</i> - forms, computer programs etc.  Trying to implement changes to phone number length will make y2k efforts look trivial.<p>Heck when places started requiring the dialling of area codes because &quot;local&quot; areas especially big cities had more than one, was disruptive enough.  That started happening in the mid-nineties.<p>Given the choice between huge disruption, or termination fees being the same and the costs of connecting between the phone company and the person making/receiving the calls being their business, the latter isn&#x27;t an unreasonable choice.

Most people are pretty good at recalling the major items they worked on in a day -- and if they can&#x27;t, they can usually reconstruct what happened by examining e-mail history, commit logs, work product, etc. It&#x27;s a lot harder to recall how many <i>hours</i> you spent on something though. Based on personal experience at least, if I&#x27;m not actively using a timer or using some kind of software that records what I&#x27;m doing in real time, my personal recollection tends to be way off. Even when I am using a timer, I often run into issues like forgetting to turn off the timer when I take a gym or coffee break.<p>There&#x27;s also all sorts of performance anxiety when it comes to hourly tracking. Not all hours are equal. I&#x27;m personally way more productive in the morning than I am right after lunch. But as far as invoicing goes, an hour&#x27;s an hour. So I can either feel guilty about billing two hours for something that should have taken only one or I can write an hour off, which introduces even more overhead. With daily or weekly billing, a lot of that gets smoothed out.",1406155279

8077313,comment,8065608,8073105,1,0,roel_v,,,"Well yes, that code points aren&#x27;t enough as your first example demonstrates, is part of my point.<p>Where I&#x27;m coming from is this: about a week ago I thought the same as you do. Since then I&#x27;ve researched on how to move a big MBCS codebase (Visual Studio speak for &#x27;std::string = array of char&#x27;s, mostly) to Unicode (i.e. Microsoft-speak for &#x27;use UTF-16 encoding for strings internally, and call all the UTF-16 API&#x27;s, rather than the char-based ones which expect 8-bit strings encoded in the current code page&#x27;). (I&#x27;m just explaining because I don&#x27;t know if you have experience with how Visual C++ and Windows handle these things).<p>My conclusion is that the people at utf8everywhere.org propose the least wrong approach, which is to use std::string for everything in C++, and assume that the encoding is utf-8.<p>What is the relationship to this discussion - well, when you do the above, std::string::length() doesn&#x27;t return the number of &#x27;characters&#x27; any more, just the size in bytes. So does iteration - it iterates over bytes.<p>Why do I think this is not as big a problem as I though it was a week ago: the circumstances where you need to iterate over &#x27;characters&#x27; (note that &#x27;character&#x27; doesn&#x27;t really mean anything; what you need in your examples isn&#x27;t iterating over code points, it&#x27;s iterating over grapheme clusters) are few and far between.<p>Neither of your examples will be fixed when the string would let you iterate over code points. What you need instead, is a way to ask your rendering engine (albeit in this case, the console): &#x27;when you render this sequence of bytes, how wide will the result be&#x27;. (in the units of your output device, be it a fixed-width output device like a console, or a variable-width one when rendering in a GUI.)<p>On the other hand, when working with strings, what you do often need is the size in bytes: for allocating buffers, for letting others know the &#x27;size&#x27; of the string (which they need to know, at the least, in bytes), etc.<p>So:\n- you always need to know the &#x27;size&#x27; in bytes, and that has a fixed meaning.\n- you very seldom need to know the &#x27;size&#x27; in code points, or iterate over it. For the cases where you do, you can use an external library. (of course it would be convenient if that functionality was baked in, but where do you draw the line? code-point level access <i>is</i> very rare)\n- you sometimes need to know the &#x27;size&#x27; in grapheme clusters, but there is no fixed definition of &#x27;size&#x27; in that context; it&#x27;s something that depends on your output device. No string class or type can account for that. At best you can say &#x27;I want to know the amount of units if this string were rendered in a fixed-width font&#x27;, which is sensible, but not only very complex but also asking (imo) too much of a string representation that is to be used in <i>today&#x27;s</i> programming languages and library ecosystems.<p>So while I feel your pain, I think what you&#x27;re asking is not realistic nor even very useful today. At some point in time, 10 or 20 years down the road where full &#x27;unicode&#x27; support of all software everywhere is the default, maybe yes.<p>(as an aside, when reading up about this the last week, I looked at e.g. the Swift string API - <a href=""https://developer.apple.com/library/prerelease/ios/documentation/Swift/Conceptual/Swift_Programming_Language/StringsAndCharacters.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https://developer.apple.com/library/prerelease/ios/documenta...</a> - and felt a bit jealous. So this is probably a first start towards the bright future I mentioned above, but it still has some weirdnesses nobody used to &#x27;char = 1 byte, only 7-bit ASCII allowed&#x27; strings would expect.)",1406155038

8077210,comment,8074654,8074654,2,0,xenadu02,,,"Seems like iOS 8 should offer a settings screen to allow you to revoke sync keys and/or see a list of computers you&#x27;ve trusted in the past. Perhaps it should default to deleting the keys if you haven&#x27;t sync&#x27;d with a specific computer in some timeout period (30 days?).<p>A few of the services should be locked down a bit further regardless of anything else.<p>I also don&#x27;t see this as a valid bypass of encrypted files - you need the device to be on and have its passcode entered. That&#x27;s a far cry from taking a cold device, booting it, then connecting with a stolen sync key. Besides the fact that we&#x27;ve known you were unsafe if the device was unlocked for some time - some police even carry Faraday bags and portable chargers to keep them accessible probably for this very reason.",1406153224

If nobody clicks on the ad, then that advertising is useless.  Maybe they just want to put their brand into the viewer&#x27;s head rather than have the viewer click on the ad.

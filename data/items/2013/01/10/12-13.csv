5036628,comment,5030803,5036027,5,0,pavelludiq,,,"Are you trolling? First off, learning C well enough to understand opengl documentation will take you much less time that understanding opengl it self(since you'll only need to read and not write C). You have a problem, people gave you a solution, having separate cl docs for opengl that have THE SAME contents, but using lisp function names instead of C ones(as it was explained, it is simple function to transform one into the other in your head). What the hell do you want?<p>PS I forgot why I stopped commenting on HN threads about lisp. If you read the old usenet, this kind of discussion has been plaguing lisp since day one. People complain, and when given the solution, they just start bitching about something else, avoiding the solution. There are no docs, now the docs are in C, what else? As I've become part of the lisp community, I learned the proper way to fix this, If I encounter deficiency in the lisp ecosystem, I deal with it if I can, and If I can't I politely ask the author/maintainer if they have time to work on the issue. If they don't have the time, I simply accept reality, and move on with my problems. Bitching on HN solves nothing. Honestly, why lisp? Why do people have this supreme need to express their dissatisfaction with a language, with libraries developed by humans in their spare time away from their lives, for free. Be fucking happy, and help out if you care about lisp, otherwise, just shut up!",1357822762
5036627,comment,5036119,5036477,2,0,sirclueless,,,"If a tree falls in the forest...<p>""the money never left the account"" is not really the way to think of this. The bank does not move around piles of cash when you withdraw money, or keep some gold set aside in a vault for your use. ""The account"" is the amount of money that the bank attributes to you when it is drawn upon.<p>Basically, I think you are mixing up cause and effect. The log of debits and credits <i>is</i> the account. The balance is some derived number that represents all of the cleared transactions in the account. It is useful because it determines policy around your account (how much interest to give, how much to let you withdraw from an ATM), but it's not the fundamental building block of banking.",1357822698

Now adding a tag in git is equivalent to publishing a versioned library! Magic!<p>Few things in software are worse than magic. I guess I'm advocating a little friction here, just for the sake of safety; it works better if people take make an easy but explicit choice that some builds are for others to use and some builds are not. Again I guess that's a matter of community norms.<p>>I find the software complex and difficult to use. All I want to do is use my own jar with my own project, and I have to wade through an unintuitive, difficult to use, edge-case ridden web app that I have to maintain myself?<p>Like with hosting or version control or anything, you will probably want to host your own sooner or later, but you can start off by using someone else's. And FWIW I have an opposite view on the UI, though without concrete examples there's probably no point talking further.<p>>Maven - if I understand this correctly and I would not be surprised if there was some arcana which prevents me from doing so - expects each version to immutable. So when SNAPSHOTs change, I end up deleting my .m2 directory to figure it out.<p>I don't know what you were doing wrong, but that's not a normal problem. When you build something that depends on a snapshot maven will by default refetch it if it hasn't for a certain time; if you use -U it will always refetch it, if you're using offline mode it will always use your local copy.<p>>But even if this were somehow good, why would people use maven for Ruby? They're different languages, ecosystems, etc. It doesn't even make any sense.<p>Maven is very flexible and plugin-based, and a lot of things e.g. the repository, the release process, various plugins could work the same. Obviously it would only work if a whole language ecosystem adopted it, it's probably too late for Ruby.",1357820578

I've researched and thought a great deal about why these problems occur and the root cause of them is invariably humanity itself.<p>We look at how much food the human race produces and see that there is absolutely no reason why anyone should starve, yet many people do. We have plenty of water yet people die of dehydration. Why is this? Our technology is clearly advanced enough that these problems should not exist. Should we keep working to improve our technology?<p>My argument is that we should drop what we're doing, take a step back and think about how we got into this mess - that we stop working and consider where we're going and how we are getting there. Why, in a huge corporation, are there some employees earning minimum wage and barely making enough to survive while someone working the exact same hours has two houses and three cars? Why are there people living on the streets in what are apparently first world countries? Why is the inequality gap growing instead of decreasing? Shouldn't all this work be improving the situation?<p>My contention is that we cannot work ourselves out of this problem. We need to sit down, think and talk. We need to empathise with each other and share. I believe that the solution to the problems that plague people will find their remedy on the social level. That is, information, and access to that information, is the key to resolving them, not working hard to keep the streets clean or developing the newest iPhone or building new houses. Don't get me wrong, those things are important too, but we have the capability to automate a lot of them yet we have not done so. Why are robots not roaming the streets and keeping them spotless? Why are people working for pennies in factories to make our smartphones?<p>I believe that answering these questions and doing something about them will go a lot further than turning up to a 9-5 every day. It's all very good having an engine that can produce a thousand horsepower but if the steering wheel is not used to aim the car in the right direction, it will crash.

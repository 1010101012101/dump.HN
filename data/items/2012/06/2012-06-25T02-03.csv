If we have to continue to define interfaces for our lambdas then we might as well continue to use anonymous classes and remove the final restriction (that's completely backward compatible).  The final restriction wasn't required in the original design of anonymous classes before the community freaked out over memory allocation of primitives.  The reason closures are a pain in Java is having to meet the static typing declarations using interfaces for our anonymous classes.  The whole point to this was to create a compact syntax for declaring methods that take lamdas as parameters without resorting to interfaces.<p>I also wish that default mechanism could be extended to existing classes as well so we could add methods to classes because the real question is what are the API changes to collection, File, etc with respect to the addition of lambdas.  The places where Java has fallen short in the past is the API (Collection.join? Collection.map, Collection.reduce, new File( String... paths), etc).",1340592627

Pretty straightfoward, if you see it in practice.<p>As far as control-flow goes, things are kind of very oposite. FP languages tend to use pattern matching (that is, switch statements / the observer pattern) on transparent types to do branching while OO languages settled to use message passing over opaque types. These two approaches are very much opposites - pattern matching makes it easy to add new functions and harder to add new ""cases"" and also forces types to be transparent. OO dispatching on the other hand, makes it easy to add new cases (classes) but makes it harder to add new methods. The objects are also opaque and encapsulated. (For more on this, search for the ""expression problem"")<p>As far as polymorphism goes, things tend to be pretty different. OO languages focus on subtyping, writing code that works seamlessly with a class and its subclasses. This is good for always being able to add new subclasses without breaking old code.<p>FP languages, on the other hand, tend to focus more on parameric polymorphism (generics, that is, writing code that doesn't care what types its manipulating) and Haskell handles ad-hoc polymorphism with type classes. Type classes are kind of like OO interfaces, but they allow type classes to be created after the types that ""implement"" them but do not allow you to turn previously monomorphic code into polymorphic code (so its kind of the opposite of OO in this sense).<p>----<p>Finally, if you are willing to go really academic on this, you can check out things like Cardeli's ""A theory of Objects"". Computer scientists inevitably end up translating everything back into the functional calculi they are confortable with and this leads to formal FP-to-OO translations, if that is what you are looking for. Just to warn you though, it turns out that some things like support for inheritance and dynamic dispatching can seriously complicate the final models.",1340590658

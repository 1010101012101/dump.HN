Also, in colder countries / states, the equation doesn't look as rosy. In winter, you use the heat generated by the combustion engine. Hence, efficiency goes way up.<p>Without knowing any numbers, I would assume, that at the moment, an additional, fossil fuel based, heating system would do the best job for an electric car.

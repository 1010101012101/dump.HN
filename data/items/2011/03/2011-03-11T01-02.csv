The idea is compelling: most web developers just need a highlighting-capable text editor with online connectivity. Many of us work directly on staging servers, so in theory if there was a capable web-based editor around, you could work from pretty much any computer without having to install something. You could log into your web-based editor and all your bookmarks, SSH certs, everything would be there.<p>Now, Cloud9 is - from what I understand - the commercial version of this concept.

I don't mean to sound like I am complaining, as this is my first post, but I want to help you improve the site. (I am no expert on viral sites, but I assume the better the site the more likely it will go viral.)<p>There are two things I see possibly going wrong:
1. www.3pics.me should redirect to 3pics.me. I know most techies think this fairly common knowledge, and it is quickly becoming so, but I still have family who think you have to tack www on front of all websites you go to. So my basic thought is if Joe Average can't find the site, it will severely limit your audience.<p>2. You are using just a cookie to remember if someone has already voted. This is a problem. A small script such as the following could quickly inflate the results.<p>for i in $( seq 10 ); do wget --no-cookie --post-data='upload%5Bid%5D=34'  3pics.me/1; done<p>(I tested it to check to see if my suspicion was correct, I only ran with 10 requests with one second intervals between each request to minimize any possible damage.  upload[id] =34 has 10 extra votes.

I doubt very much that there are many people who do either for the money directly earned through ad or book sales.<p>Now, I agree that  this model doesn't work for, say, big-budget action movies and for many (maybe, as you say, most[1]) other media types.<p>But, these people working for ""free"" have always been  a big part of the press;  I don't think that writing has ever paid particularly well, except for a few at the very top.<p>Edit: 
There is a corporate equivalent to this that <i>dominates</i> the trade magazine industry.     Corporations write something very much like a press release advertising their new product, and send it off to a writer for the magazine, who publishes it, perhaps with a few changes, as if it were a story.    Hell, speaking of high-budget action flicks, BMW did something similar a while back;  they released a series of short action films[2]  that featured their vehicles.    Being something of a fan of action films myself, I rather enjoyed them, even though they were obviously commercials.<p>[1] Thinking more on what ""more media"" is, I'm starting to come around to your position.   Now, I certainly spend /more time/ consuming media like blog posts or technical books where the author was primarily remunerated in terms of an increased reputation compared to media produced for the money.<p>However, even if you say I spend 100 hours reading tech books or blog posts for every 1 hour I spend watching big-budget action flicks, that one hour of action movie probably took more human hours to produce than the 100 hours of tech book or blog post.    Of course, if you measure the   the cost of production divided by the number of people watching it, then it's possible that the flashy action movie was actually cheaper to produce than the tech book, I mean, per human hour spent watching the thing.<p>[2]<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hire"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hire</a>",1299808111

There is a strong correlation between continuing education and continuing competence.<p>A lot of young developers re-create the wheel, they don't know they are because they haven't been around the block that many times but they are. Then along comes an older developer who has to use their code/api/design and recognizes it for what it is, another wheel designed by someone who didn't realize this was old hat. How someone responds to this situation (which occurs again and again) seems to be key.<p>You can note the particular vagaries of this particular implementation of the wheel concept and work with it to get done what you want to get done, you can throw it out and replace it with a more up to date implementation of a wheel, or you can get disgusted at how little this developer knew when they tried to do this particular implementation of wheelness. I got to meet the guy who invented the insertion sort this way, not. (well he thought he had invented it)<p>Seeing wheel re-implementations gets old fast, trust me.<p>So if you let it get to you, you lose your sense of wonder. That thing where every new technique you saw was thought provoking and, well, new. It gets replaced with ""gee IBM did it that way in the 60's and it didn't work for them either.""  If you let it get under your skin you will burn out and become one of those developers that just stops looking at new stuff because you know you will have seen it all before and it will be wrong for the same reasons the other six versions were wrong. And you will miss out on the stuff that really is new, and your currency in the art will degrade.<p>How many developers under 30 do you know who can tell you the second order effects of their new network protocol? How many even care? How many have found themselves intersecting the same bad design decisions that were bad back in the last century and are still bad today?<p>And finally, technologists are often like classmates from college, at first nobody you know is married then it seems like everyone you know is, or no one has kids and then suddenly everyone is busy with their kids. Your social circle ages like you do, if you know a lot of really great developers when you are 25 I can guarantee you that you will know several when you are 45.",1299807282

Rails provided a great framework to get something up and running. It provides MVC and interacts with a database. After familiarising myself with Rails I started using Sinatra (which doesn't offer any MVC or support you get from Rails) and then ultimately started coding just in Ruby. I don't think there's any issue with the learning curve for Rails because it provides the support where you need it.

3328445,comment,3327085,3327286,1,0,exDM69,,,">> FXAA and other similar techniques are only relevant when dealing with deferred rendering only. Detecting edges on the depth buffer may sound as the solution until you realize that two planes at right angles has an edge between that can alias. The change there is in the normal and not the Z.<p>Why do you say that FXAA is only relevant to deferred rendering?<p>If you have a deferred rendering setup, you'll have the depth buffer and the normal buffer (a floating point texture with normal vectors) available. These can be used to do edge detection for silhouette edges and non-silhouette sharp edges.<p>I don't know the details of modern anti aliasing techniques, but I'd guess that you can get the best edge detection using a combination of the color, depth and normal buffer. Whether you want to do this for anti aliasing is a different issue, a simple RGB edge detect may yield better results.<p>>> Also modern graphics cards do not give programmatic access to the z-buffer as the z-buffer format is often proprietary. Deferred shading based renderers often duplicate the z-value also into a texture.<p>This doesn't make any sense. The depth buffer may be internally stored in a compressed proprietary format, but it's still available to the programmer as a regular buffer or texture.<p>You have plenty of ways to access the depth buffer for reading. The depth buffer can be rendered into a texture (either as floating point or regular 24 bit integer), which can be read back in a shader. You can do regular lookups where you get back the depth value or a shadow lookup with percentage closer filtering.<p>The depth values can also be read back from the buffers (using glReadPixels in OpenGL) to be analyzed on the CPU (not feasible for anything realtime) or saved to disk or whatever.",1323337417

Have you gone back to a update a Rails project that is 3 years old or more?  I have, and it's significantly more hassle in general than going back and updating a PHP project that is 10 years old.<p>Personally I think this is a small price to pay for a framework that stays up to date and still releases forward-thinking features on a regular basis (Rails modularization in 3.0 and the asset pipeline in 3.1 are amazing features that an emphasis on backwards compatibility could have made more difficult), but let's acknowledge that it is not an unmitigated win in all aspects.",1323336966

But once you're past that, it's not so great. What you care more about is the usability of the thing once you know it. There are plenty of cases where learnability and usability are in conflict. Letting learnability win is a short-term relief.<p>If you on the other hand optimize for usability, for making things simple and easy to use for someone who understands the basics, you'll often end up with something that has great learnability as well. Maybe not as much as could be achieved as if that was your only goal, but plenty still.<p>The other aspect is whether you as a framework designer are designing something for yourself and your peers or if you're trying to dumb things down on behalf of beginners. In other words, designing for what you think beginners might find easy in their learning phase. That's really hard to do. Most technology I've seen designed in such a master/apprentice fashion sucks.<p>Finally, when you're comparing complexity, it's generally more helpful to look at the complexity involved with completing an entire task. Comparing complexity of ""hello world"" tells you little about what the complexity is going to be like developing a complete, modern web application from database migrations to XSS/CRSF protection.<p>That's where learnability and usability are again in conflict. Yes, it's harder to learn a framework that has answers for things like ""how do I migrate a database once I have data I care about"", or whatever feature you want to focus on, but once you hit that problem, you'll be glad that it's there and find the solution less complex than stringing something together from tons of separate parts yourself.<p>All that being said, I think Sinatra is wonderful. So what if it's not a fit for building a whole Basecamp or Github? It's great for teaching someone the basics of how HTTP works and it's great for smaller surface apps or for smaller, isolated parts of bigger apps.",1323336944

I believe protocol would in fact give him formal control if he did, despite his confusion. Robert appears to have been communicating his control correctly but Bonin appears to have been providing input during this time. We'll never know if he didn't realize he was providing input or if he didn't realize someone else was trying to control the plane.",1323334879

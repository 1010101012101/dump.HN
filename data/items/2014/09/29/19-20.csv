For example, Toronto (or Vancouver) as a market has a much higher percentage of Asian owned real estate than Canada as a whole.<p>This laser focus on one specific area for investment raises the value of real estate in that area to out of reach for most of its native residents.

If Tor detects that your exit and your site share an IP address, it will automatically extend the normally 3-hop circuit to your node, and the traffic will exit the Tor network on your machine rather than an arbitrary node (which could be malicious).<p>For what it&#x27;s worth, DuckDuckGo has done this for the past 4 years[0].<p>I think StartPage is still the default for the Tor browser bundle, but I&#x27;m not sure if they have an exit enclave as well.<p>[0] <a href=""http://www.gabrielweinberg.com/blog/2010/08/duckduckgo-now-operates-a-tor-exit-enclave.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.gabrielweinberg.com/blog/2010/08/duckduckgo-now-o...</a>",1412020644

Or rather: what people wish it was saying. Frequentist methods give you &quot;if page A performs the same as page B then then the likelihood of observing something at least as extreme as this measurement is less than X%&quot;. In practice we never want to know this information. What people actually want to know is &quot;given this measurement, the probability of page A being better than page B is X%&quot;, so they interpret whatever number comes out of the frequentist method like that...wishful thinking.<p>Just give them 2 posterior distributions of the conversion rate of page A and page B. It may look more daunting than a single number at first, but it&#x27;s much easier to interpret than that single number that comes out of hypothesis testing, and, you know, it&#x27;s the information they actually need to make a decision whether to pick page A or page B.",1412020627

When they do hire new staff it is usually someone who has been doing that Java at banks or for the government, for 5-8 years and it just continues.

By &quot;from the ground up&quot;, I don&#x27;t mean a complete rewrite, but at least a complete re-thinking of what an OS should be in modern times. Like when FAT wasn&#x27;t good enough anymore, let&#x27;s switch to NTFS and get rid of DOS at the same time. What exactly that looks like, I don&#x27;t know. I&#x27;m not a designer and I don&#x27;t work on OS development, so I&#x27;m not an expert. I can tell you the features I would like in my OS, and maybe you could extrapolate what I mean from there?<p>I would like it to be responsive, so it best uses the capabilities of the hardware you give it. Windows 8 started, but didn&#x27;t get quite there. Ubuntu has a nice idea for plugging your phone into a monitor and getting a full Ubuntu install. If I&#x27;m tapping, don&#x27;t make me double tap just because I would normally double click. Recognize that it&#x27;s a tap and not a click. And don&#x27;t give me options my device can&#x27;t handle. Don&#x27;t show me a desktop on a 7&quot; tablet. Don&#x27;t default to full-screen apps on a 4k display. And if my monitor is big enough that it could be four regular sized monitors, tile my windows automatically. It&#x27;s not that hard to do.<p>I&#x27;m tired of starting something on my PC and trying to figure out how to continue on a tablet or a phone, or even just another PC. This could either depend on application developers to support or be baked well enough into the OS that applications don&#x27;t even know it&#x27;s happening, but everything should be available to me everywhere. Again, Windows 8 has a nice start with Onedrive, but I still have to manually save things there. Why not replicate my drives so I can access any file from any where without even thinking about it? Make it completely invisible what is local storage and what is cloud storage, and with that, cache things on my hard drive for if the network goes down. If I don&#x27;t have a connection, everything should be there. If I do have a connection again, everything that happened without a connection should automatically show up on my phone and tablet too. Make Onedrive/Dropbox automatic and invisible.<p>That&#x27;s actually an annoyance I have with Github, too. Why do I need to manually commit my changes? When I hit ctrl+s, it should just go straight to version control. If I need to revert later, well, that&#x27;s why I&#x27;m using version control, right?<p>I don&#x27;t want to have to boot. I don&#x27;t want to have to shut down (or wait 10 minutes while it shuts down). I don&#x27;t want to have to install updates, nor do I want to have to reboot for those updates. Chrome is the best model here. Just push updates in the background and either apply them immediately or wait until the system is idle and apply them.<p>I don&#x27;t want to think about anti-virus. Actually this is the one thing Windows 8 got perfectly. I&#x27;ve never thought about putting an AV on my system. It&#x27;s just there.<p>I don&#x27;t want to run out of power. Windows Phone is a great reference system. If power is getting low, start disabling features that drain the battery. I can handle checking email manually if it means I get another hour of battery life. My eyes will adjust to a dimmer display for a little while. Facebook can wait. If power is low, disable the things that I have turned on but am not using.<p>Now, I know a lot of these features would be very controversial to the HN crowd (since Windows 8 is very controversial). But that&#x27;s fine. Anyone who threatened to switch to OSX or Linux because of Windows 8 is free to do so. I want a desktop OS with the simplicity of an iPad, but the problem with the iPad is that it&#x27;s simple, but not magic. Make it magic. I don&#x27;t want to micromanage my computer. That&#x27;s why we invented computers in the first place.",1412020363

The faculty salaries are not nearly as concerning as NYU handing out cash outside of compensation packages, and allegations of nepotism.<p>She specifically cites one individual who was given use of a university-owned apartment despite not being affiliated with the university except familial connections - he was neither staff nor student. She also cites other individuals who were given loans by the university to purchase personal property, which were never repaid and in fact written off very soon after. She goes on to cite other examples of school administrators using NYU&#x27;s funds as their private bank account.<p>Extreme compensation packages is one thing (and arguably necessary), but corruption and nepotism is a whole &#x27;nother ball game.<p>In any case, the main thrust of the author&#x27;s argument aside, her complaint about the professor salaries isn&#x27;t the salaries, but rather the intent of the institution. Why does NYU have to compete with MIT and Harvard? The author laments the loss of an institution whose primary mission was the education of its citizenry, not competing for the wealthiest students from around the world.<p>The author argues that NYU was not, and did not need to become, a &quot;world class&quot; institution, and that despite attracting world-class faculty talent from around the world it is failing at the mission of educating New Yorkers, both in its focus on international prestige at the expense of quality education, and in its poor finances compared to other high-end institutions that passes the financial cost of this glory-seeking directly onto students in ever-increasing sums.",1412020089

After an earlier discussion about Aubrey de Grey here on Hacker News, I spent an afternoon at a university library looking up publications by him, about him, and about his hypotheses about human aging. Basically, there are a lot of people who think his mitochondrial free-radical hypothesis about aging has already been demonstrated to be wrong.[1] His biography article page on Wikipedia is an interesting example of a page about a living person that is mostly edited by fans, as it has been full of statements over the years that cannot be verified by any published source, contrary to Wikipedia policy for articles about living persons. I would not count on de Grey&#x27;s program, which is hardly ever published about in any journal except the journal he owns and edits, to produce the big gains in longevity that he predicts.<p>On the other hand, incremental progress by thousands of more careful researchers has already led to major gains in healthy lifespan. Girls born since 2000 in the developed world are more likely than not to reach the age of 100 (not 1,000, as de Grey is mentioned as saying in the article submitted here), with boys likely to enjoy lifespans almost as long. The article &quot;The Biodemography of Human Ageing&quot; by James Vaupel,[2] originally published in the journal Nature in 2010, is a good current reference on the subject. Vaupel is one of the leading scholars on the demography of aging and how to adjust for time trends in life expectancy. His striking finding is &quot;Humans are living longer than ever before. In fact, newborn children in high-income countries can expect to live to more than 100 years. Starting in the mid-1800s, human longevity has increased dramatically and life expectancy is increasing by an average of six hours a day.&quot;[3]<p>An article in a series on Slate, &quot;Why Are You Not Dead Yet? Life expectancy doubled in past 150 years.

There was a prophetic (if early) contest at Sun to &#x27;imagine the future&#x27; and the winner got a SPARCStation. As a networking guy I tried to imagine what was going to change when the &#x27;big yellow hose&#x27; (which is what 10MB Ethernet looked like at the time) came right into your living room. And one of the things that changed was that you could work at &#x27;home&#x27; like you did at work, which at the time was most of the stuff on a beefy server with lots of CPU + storage and just the X windows on the local machine. (this worked fine with a lot less than 10MB of bandwidth of course, but it was conceptually a &#x27;return to mainframes&#x27; pitch)<p>The economics are pretty sweet, given the marginal cost of one additional subscriber to a cloud &#x27;hosted&#x27; environment. Google Drive / Drop box gets the storage requirement out of the way. Company X, acquires/operates a small server farm connected with a generic 10G pipe to the &#x27;web&#x27; (this is an off the self config at places like Switch in Las Vegas). Sign up a bunch of subscribers where you have a &#x27;free&#x27; tier to sop up excess compute and a paid tier for folks who care enough about response times to pay for them.<p>The dependency on the network has always been troubling, but once the network is like house &#x27;power&#x27;. so many things one does depend on the house having power available, making it a requirement becomes less and less onerous. Combined with things that make traveling with data annoying (like cross border inspections) and I can see this as the future of application level computing for a lot of things.<p>Interesting that terminals are the future once again.",1412019645

Yes, you could maybe get paid more if there was a union restricting labor supply, which is how they work, but it would really suck to have union seniority rules or have union say in who works where. It limits freedom for both employers and employees once the important items like job safety have been addressed.

8384741,comment,8384641,8384641,3,0,jonnyy,,,"My understanding of unions has been that they work through the restriction of the supply of their labor. I haven&#x27;t thought about it for very long, but it seems to me that the union&#x27;s success is contingent on its being able to prevent other companies from hiring developers unless they hire only union-certified employees. I am doubtful this can happen.<p>I think that a semi-successful union would hamper the success of smaller companies by demanding that they hire only certified, highly-paid engineers. These engineers can only work a certain number of hours, use certain languages, etc. (Assuming such conditions can be enforced in the first place, with so many available employers in the market).<p>These conditions seem to me difficult for many organizations to accommodate. Thus, my thinking is that a semi-successful union would trigger software boot camps like App Academy to attempt to &quot;break&quot; the union by increasing available supply. The union would then fail. Collusion between Apple, Google, and other companies to hold down salaries only succeeds if there is no &quot;spoiler&quot;.

It echoed many of the thoughts I&#x27;ve had over the past ten years of teaching programming off and on, and many of the frustrations I&#x27;ve had with existing online learn-to-code tools. (I actually wrote one such tool back in 2007, an interactive learn-to-code webapp called the AppJet Learn to Program Guide.)<p>In my experience, puzzling through problems with quick iteration and support from a mentor is the most effective way to learn programming. Especially in the early stages, as Christina identifies, the hardest task is simply articulating an algorithm in English:<p>> For all the hemming about programming languages, the hardest part for these students was solving puzzles in English, not Java. Often, they’d skip to the Java, glossing over their logic. This didn’t work, but “forget Java for a moment; what are you trying to do in English?” and “How would you explain what you’re trying to do to a 5 year-old?” were the two questions most likely to unstick them. Once they explained the logic – “go through all the letters. If you find an A, swap it with the prior letter” – the Java came easily.<p>Nearly all online tools I&#x27;ve tried come up short in this regard, because of the major stumbling block that is building an accurate mental model (an &quot;intuition&quot;) for how computers run your program. None of these tools tell you how to correct your mental model, because none of them really identify your mental model in the first place. For this, a human teacher is very useful!<p>Tools like the one Christina is building -- tools that allow for quick iteration and quick communication between learner and teacher -- are critical in that they let teachers focus on the hard part, on developing that intuition.<p>Christina, I fully support your effort to create tools that help humans teach other humans how to program!",1412019095

Our strongest insight into subjective preference is revealed preference.  Without action, preference is not revealed, and where preference is revealed by action, we can only know that one preference is higher than another -- ordinal.  We cannot determine that one preference is, say, 10x higher than another.  These are the limitations of utility analysis for a single person.<p>Diminishing marginal utility holds for a single person, and it ought to hold for interpersonal comparisons <i>ceteris paribus</i>, but of course <i>ceteris paribus</i> is a logical impossibility for interpersonal comparison given subjective preference.  To hold <i>ceteris paribus</i> for two people is to assert they are the same person, and we&#x27;re back to diminishing marginal utility for a single person.<p>Our only guide to interpersonal utility comparison is intuition, which is easily confounded.

Here&#x27;s my attempt to pick it apart.<p><pre><code>    template<std::size_t count , typename STRING>\n    struct build_string_impl;\n</code></pre>\nI think the above is a template that resolves to a forward declaration of a struct type called build_string_impl. It says, give me a size and a type STRING, and I give you a struct type.<p><pre><code>    template<std::size_t count , char... Cs>\n    struct build_string_impl<count,string<Cs...>>\n    {\n        using result = typename build_string_impl<count-1,string<c+count,Cs...>>::result;\n    };\n</code></pre>\nI think the above is a partial specialization of the above forward declaration. In this specialization, the typename STRING is not a string, but instead a variadic char-thingy. So the &#x27;typename STRING&#x27; is misleading. This partial specialization creates a struct type that contains a member type &#x27;result&#x27; that aliases the &#x27;result&#x27; type member of a recursive template instantiation.<p><pre><code>    template<char... Cs>\n    struct build_string_impl<0,string<Cs...>>\n    {\n    \tusing result = string<c,Cs...>;\n    };\n</code></pre>\nThis is a partial specialization that represents the base case. It declares a template that creates a struct type build_string_impl that contains a member type &#x27;result&#x27; that aliases the &#x27;result&#x27; of a string type.<p>Where I get lost is here:<p><pre><code>    build_string_impl<count-1,string<c+count,Cs...>>\n</code></pre>\nThis attempts to instantiate the build_string_impl template with a size_t and a string.

In the 80s I wrote an operating system for 6809, but I did have access to an ICE.  I, and I&#x27;m sure many others, wanted to write something for that new 386 SX the second it came out.  I thought Linus Torvalds had access to a 386 emulator at university, but I can&#x27;t find a reference.  I did find this, which describes how he debugged without one:<p>(from <a href=""http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~awb/linux.history.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~awb/linux.history.html</a>)<p>(he would have hated the machines I use these days, they take 6 minutes to boot)<p>&quot;The worst part is starting off: after you have even a minimal system you can use printf etc, but moving to protected mode on a 386 isn&#x27;t fun, especially if you at first don&#x27;t know the architecture very well.  It&#x27;s\ndistressingly easy to reboot the system at this stage: if the 386 notices something is wrong, it shuts down and reboots - you don&#x27;t even get a chance to see what&#x27;s wrong.<p>Printf() isn&#x27;t very useful - a reboot also clears the screen, and anyway, you have to have access to video-mem, which might fail if your segments are incorrect etc.  Don&#x27;t even think about debuggers: no debugger I know of can follow a 386 into protected mode.  A 386 emulator\nmight do the job, or some heavy hardware, but that isn&#x27;t usually feasible.<p>What I used was a simple killing-loop: I put in statements like<p>die:\n        jmp die<p>at strategic places.  If it locked up, you were ok, if it rebooted, you knew at least it happened before the die-loop.  Alternatively, you might use the sound io ports for some sound-clues, but as I had no experience with PC hardware, I didn&#x27;t even use that.  I&#x27;m not saying this is the only way: I didn&#x27;t start off to write a kernel, I just wanted to explore the 386 task-switching primitives etc, and that&#x27;s how I started off (in about April-91).<p>After you have a minimal system up and can use the screen for output, it gets a bit easier, but that&#x27;s when you have to enable interrupts. Bang, instant reboot, and back to the old way. All in all, it took about 2 months for me to get all the 386 things pretty well sorted out so that I no longer had to count on avoiding rebooting at once, and having the basic things set up (paging, timer-interrupt and a simple task-switcher to test out the segments etc).&quot;",1412018409

Even the Blit in the video was a smart terminal (&quot;you can run programs on it&quot;). The way Plan 9 works is<p>> send data to a user&#x27;s computer and let local applications worry about dealing with the data.<p>It was apparently different in the 90&#x27;s (&quot;terminal was a computer but we didn&#x27;t compute on it&quot;) but nowadays in Plan 9 you do nearly everything on the terminal. For different reasons: the WM, the browsers, the editors run on the terminal for responsiveness; image and music decoders run on the terminal because they need a higher bandwidth to the screen/speakers than to the fs (jpegs, mp3s, etc are compressed); plumber and factotum run on your terminal so that you get exactly one instance of them per session, and that they die as soon as you end your session.<p>The central boxes are only really used for FS/backup, auth, cron, maybe mail servers or whatever.<p>So nearly everything runs on the terminal, but it&#x27;s a Plan 9 terminal so it&#x27;s still just a matter of plug it in, turn it on, set up netbooting (once).<p>> it&#x27;s very obviously worse OUTSIDE of those institutions.<p>What I was going to say before I decided that it was too much of a tangent was: and Plan 9 NOT being a proper distributed OS could be a plus: it&#x27;s possible to use recover(4) or lapfs(4) and bring the laptop outside the network. No-one actually does that, and lapfs isn&#x27;t even a real Plan 9 program in C. but it&#x27;s still made feasible by the fact that your editor and so on is not on the far side of a connection and isn&#x27;t going to go anywhere. unlike on e.g. an Amoeba terminal, which really is just a window manager, no editors locally, no browsers or viewers.<p>I dunno about using &quot;backup&quot; to describe the Plan 9 file server, but that&#x27;s even more unrelated to my original comment.",1412017980

The graph in the original announcement ( <a href=""http://devblogs.nvidia.com/parallelforall/accelerate-machine-learning-cudnn-deep-neural-network-library/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://devblogs.nvidia.com/parallelforall/accelerate-machine...</a> ) shows a 11x speed-up for using Caffe on the GPU versus CPU, and a 14x speed-up for using Caffe + cuDNN (again compared to CPU).<p>Then again these figures are also kind of meaningless, as the specifics of the experiments were not specified. There are a lot of parameters that affect the performance of different implementations in various ways: the number of input feature maps, the number of filters, filter width/height, input width/height. The FFT-approach tends to do well for large filter sizes and lots of input feature maps, for example.<p>I&#x27;ve played around with cudnn a bit using Theano. The Theano bindings are a work in progress, but so far they&#x27;ve already wrapped the convolution. Compared to conv_gemm (Theano&#x27;s version of Caffe&#x27;s GEMM convolution approach), it seems to be sometimes faster, sometimes slower. Soumith Chintala maintains a GitHub repository with benchmarks of various convolution implementations: <a href=""https://github.com/soumith/convnet-benchmarks"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/soumith/convnet-benchmarks</a>\nHis results aren&#x27;t that spectacular either.<p>In my own experiments cuDNN did pretty well for very small filter sizes (i.e. 3x3), often beating even the memory-hungry FFT approach). This is great because the top two scoring entries in the 2014 ImageNet competition made use of lots of convolutional layers with small filters.<p>Of course the main benefit of cuDNN is that it will become faster over time, and that it will always be adapted to the latest NVIDIA GPUs without requiring code changes (provided that they keep maintaining it).",1412017633

An inexpensive alternative to hiring a social media manager and instead of a ministry constantly scouring the internet for engaging content, Turbo does it for them with hired professional writers that constantly create original, godly content to be posted. All of Turbo’s content is exclusive, meaning that users can expect to see no other church or ministry in their area with the same Facebook content. With many different content types, or as Turbo calls them -- channels, the Church as a whole no longer has to be out of the ongoing conversations on social media. Turbo is the tool that is making the Church relevant again in the sphere of social media that is influencing the world daily. I believe your readers would find it interesting to know that this app is available to them.<p>Potential users can visit www.helps2.com/turbo to be the first to snag the content they desire in their area code.

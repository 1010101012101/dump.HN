It was up to me to decide if I was interested enough to try my own hand at it, and there was no fallout if I decided after starting that I wasn't interested after all.<p>As a result, we've grown up to be independent thinkers.

The government has already shown, many times, its willingness and ability to shut down sites, unilaterally, by simply telling ICANN to redirect where a domain points. SOPA is merely a formalization of that power. I surmise that the best way to let a congressman know that you are serious about this issue is to put a bullet in the head of the congressman sitting next to him. If you aren't willing to go that far to protect your freedom, then you are just as full of hot air as the OWS crowd. I don't expect upvotes on this comment, but I am certain that all of the downvotes will come from cowards, the uniformed, idealists, or agents of the government. DNS is broken, and needs either extreme violence to protect its existing fragility, or an awesome technical improvement that will pry the government's grubby fingers off of it for good. Take your pick as to the best route, but wishing for logic and common sense at these hearings is pointless.<p>EDIT: I should point out the following, for those who think that there really is no need to worry. ""Risk of Jail for Ordinary Users: It becomes a felony with a potential 5 year sentence to stream a copyrighted work that would cost more than $2,500 to license, even if you are a totally noncommercial user, e.g. singing a pop song on Facebook."" - <a href=""http://americancensorship.org"" rel=""nofollow"">http://americancensorship.org</a> A felony is a felony is a felony. Once you are guilty of one, your life changes significantly. It all comes down to which law you are willing to break. Just a couple of decades ago, murder and treason were pretty much the only serious crimes. Now, manipulate certain bits in a particular way, and it's treated as almost the same thing.

I see a ton of professional, established web design firms still designing sites like its 1997.<p>My takeaway from this was to really just remember that the rules have their place but it's a mistake to follow them just because they've become accepted. The web has changed so much in the past 3 years alone that we need to reevaluate the rules and each time we design a site ask ourselves if we're doing this because it's the rule or because it makes sense in terms of design and usability.<p>I'm still seeing a ton of people preach about using the keyword meta tag and preaching about divitis and semantic markup. Those ideas are all well and good but things are different now. I know those aren't exactly design related issues but the point is that some people are being fed outdated info.<p>There are a lot more opportunities to break the rules And actually be rewarded these days. So you're content is more like a section than an article. Okay, well that's debatable. Too many divs? Well it could be or maybe there's no other way and it's not hurting future modifications or rendering or load times. So be it.<p>The point is that we can't be blindly following these rules. Obviously we really need to know and understand the rules first. But once you know the rules you can then break them when it makes sense. I read the post such that the author was basically saying ""think about if the rule you're about to implement makes sense. If you found another way that works do it. We're all pros and we can handle it"". Amateurs should stick to the rules until they get their bearings but the rest of us should remember that it's not 1997 anymore and sometimes those rules don't apply to the situation.<p>I'm not disagreeing with you, just had a different take on the message in the post.",1321468706

3244324,comment,3244229,3244229,26,0,jashkenas,,,"Nice post. I'd like to briefly respond to the bit about the difference between Spine, which generates pseudo-GUIDs for models created on the client, later overwriting them if the server responds with a real id; and Backbone, which has a ""cid"" (client ID) for every model regardless of the canonical server ID.<p>The reason why Backbone provides a persistent client id for the duration of every application session is so that if you need to reference model ids in your generated HTML, you <i>always</i> have something to hang your hat on. If I have '<article data-cid=""c530"">' ... I can always look up that article, regardless of if the Ajax request to create it on the server has finished or not. With Spine's approach: '<article data-id=""D6FD9261-A603-43F7-A1B2-5879E8C7926B"">' ... I'm not sure if that id is a real one, or if it's temporary, and can't be used to communicate with the server.<p>Optimistically (asynchronously, in Alex's terms) doing client-side model logic is tricky enough in the first place, without having to worry about creating an association based off a model's temporary id. I think that having a clear line between a client-only ID and the model's canonical ID is a nice distinction to have.",1321467850

These things aren't mutually exclusive by any means. All good education is self-education, and a good school is one that operates with this principle in mind: The teachers and the environment should <i>amplify</i> your self-educational tendencies, not thwart them.<p>Mind you, you'll never find a <i>whole</i> school, of any size, that works that well. (Especially in high school, and especially these days, when my understanding is that school is more regimented than ever.) You have to find the special corners.<p>You should take classes that help you. One rule is simply to study any subject that has a good teacher, no matter what it is: Ask around, find the teachers that are any good, and learn from <i>them</i>. Another rule, which I suggest often around here, is to take classes that incorporate resources that you won't find on your own. Guitars are easy to find on your own. Entire student symphony orchestras or choirs are harder to find, and fully-equipped semiconductor wafer fabs are the hardest of all to assemble in your garage, unless you're Bill Gates.",1321467467

Plenty of kids choose to take the upper level (from a high school perspective) classes, and have no trouble understanding recursion, pointers, or any of the traditional hangups, but it's a much smaller number who would ever consider working on a project that wasn't assigned by a teacher.  For everyone else, even among these incredibly bright students, programming is seen as the work you have to sludge through in order to guarantee a cushy $120k job.<p>For this small percentage of self-motivated students, the free time proposed in the original post would be a godsend, used more productively than any sort of schoolwork.  For most everyone else, however, regardless of intelligence, CS education, or resources available, this time would be thrown away to TV or video games, with a net productivity less than an hour spent doing the most menial busywork under the dullest of teachers.  I think many of us on Hacker News, surrounded by peers who are the sort of people that start businesses, tend to forget that while students might spend lectures wishing they were elsewhere, that elsewhere is rarely 80x24.<p>Admittedly, I don't have a solution.  Increased STEM funding helps, no doubt, but not in the exponential way many of us envision.

(You get fork() and POSIX-style shared memory with IPC or a queue or RPC or whatever, and you like it.)<p>It's probably true for access to POSIX and other standards. (I can't remember the article here several months ago about how to write fast network code, but it's essentially ""Embrace what Unix and Unix-like systems give you."" It's not the article about the Varnish architecture.)<p>It's almost definitely true for module repositories, where it's not enough to track dependencies and mirror downloadable code bundles.

I'm only taking a few classes in college now, yet I find myself spending every free moment in the school's library because I feel free to learn on my own terms now.<p>So I guess to clarify, what I meant in my first comment was that school sucking helped me learn the one of most important skills around: self education.<p>In the past few years I've become interested in several subjects that I wouldn't have enjoyed in a classroom setting. My recent interests have been philosophy (specifically Stoic and Epicurean), tea, Javascript and Node.js, Redis and MongoDB, Japanese art and aesthetics, investing/finance, Guitar, and classical music.<p>I hated learning Visual Basic, for example, because my teacher was aweful.

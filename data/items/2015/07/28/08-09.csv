I know the Bitcoin hash calculations are used to secure the transactions, but if there was some way of either re-purposing these calculations or adding some additional ones, then that could unleash a massive amount of computing power.

Given a two year development time we have to predict where the cool kids will be by the time our basic site/web app is funded and ready for the big time. For a complex web app two front end techs seem to lead mind share at the moment, Angular and Ember. (Yes, I realise that React is great, too, but this does not offer enough for our needs).<p>We are convinced that Node.js is the backend we want to use. It is fast and multi threaded. Both Angular and Ember will work well with this.<p>Both seem to have their fanboys who swear that one is the best.<p>Frankly, the technical argument between the two is moot - both will do our job well.<p>Two years ago, it seemed that Angular was leading, then last year Ember, but recently Angular seems to have the community weight behind (see http://eviltrout.com/2013/06/15/ember-vs-angular.html).<p>I would love to hear thoughts or stats that will support one or the other (or both). I am sure both will be around in two years. But will one start to take a lead over the other? Will one have a limited number of (expensive) developers? Will one start to lose new tech support? The technical advantages of each does play a part, but other factors often influence longer term success of a platform:- developer adoption rates, support, enterprise adoption rates and so on.<p>So the decision is not about which will be technically better. It is which will be &#x27;cool&#x27; in the community in two years time... which will have the critical number of developers.. which will considered as a &#x27;good&#x27; tech in two years time by investors and so on.<p>Any thoughts to help make this decision between Angular and Ember would be most welcome.",1438073243

In typical internet fashion, we&#x27;re mostly exposed to extreme and exaggerated viewpoints that are not above distorting a few things in order to get their message across - and this article is no exception.<p>Just to grab one strategy used in these articles (again, on both ends of the opinion spectrum): comparing apples to oranges. In this case, it&#x27;s the neuronal firing rate. The biological brain uses firing rate to encode values, but that&#x27;s rarely used in silico outside biochemical research because we have a better way of encoding values in computers.<p>One side (in my opinion, reasonably) asserts that this is an implementation detail where it makes sense to model a functional equivalent instead of strictly emulating nature. This view has gained credence from the fact that ANNs do work in practice, and even more importantly, several different ANN algorithms seem to be fit for the job. A lot of people believe this bodes well for the &quot;functional equivalence&quot; paradigm, not only as it pertains to AI, but also as it relates to the likelihood of intelligent life elsewhere in the universe.<p>The other side asserts that implementation details such as the neuronal firing rate are absolutely crucial and cannot be deviated from without invalidating the whole endeavor. They believe (and I&#x27;m trying to represent this view as fairly as I can here) that these are essential architectural details which must be preserved in order to preserve overall function. And since it&#x27;s not feasible to go this route in large-scale AI, the conclusion must be that AGI is impossible. A lot of influential people believe this, including Daniel Dennett if I recall correctly.<p>The article is very close to the latter opinion, but it goes one step further in riding the firing rate example by not even acknowledging the underlying assumption and jumping straight to attacking the feasibility of replicating the mechanism.",1438071480

As of today, it can be argued that many countries&#x27; nuclear power programs were a financial mistake.<p>Financial mistake or not, not being dependent on Petrol for your electricity production is a huge win. It solves many other (political) problems.",1442282314

This is a major practical impediment to nuclear - you won&#x27;t get costs getting driven down (for better or worse), because people see the risk as completely taboo.<p>It&#x27;s like people worrying about tall buildings, because of 9/11.

One person writes an article pointing out some flaws in a technology, then people comment saying how X is actually not a flaw, and how Y is also quite a major flaw.

Anything with megayear halflifes is effectively not radioactive.<p>There&#x27;s a lot of great answers. None of them are politically feasible because instead of thinking of it as an engineering problem, people think of it with the Sealed Evil In A Can memeset [1] and treat it like it is eternally a baleful evil demon that smites everyone that so much as thinks about it for too long, by magic.<p>It is, literally, a small problem, as in, literally, we&#x27;re not really talking about very much stuff volumetrically.<p>It&#x27;s only a problem because paradoxically people treat it with such fear that it stays a problem, because we&#x27;re so fearful that nobody is even allowed to try to solve the problem because to our fearful brains it would basically be poking the baleful evil spirit with a stick. If it were just legal to stick it in glass bricks and stack them up somewhere, as has been studied, we could be done thinking about it, but instead we have to leave it in a more dangerous form. It is frankly difficult for me not to see this as a problem that people in charge make sure to deliberately make sure stays unsolved because it suits them, not because I&#x27;m really prone to conspiracy theories but simply because while not necessarily &quot;trivial&quot;, it&#x27;s just not that hard of a problem.

10218583,comment,10217944,10217944,0,0,j2kun,,,"> Axiom 5 (which requires that there exist continuous reversible transformations between pure states) rules out classical probability theory. If Axiom 5 (or even just the word &quot;continuous&quot; from Axiom 5) is dropped then we obtain classical probability theory instead.<p>I actually recently read this paper and wondered the following question: what experiment supports the need for axiom 5, distinguishing quantum mechanics from classical probability theory? This came up because I always hear about &quot;2-norm preserving unitary operators&quot; as the only reasonable theory for quantum computing, which is of course different from classical probability. Is it just Occam&#x27;s razor that to achieve the same results in experiments one would need to impose some large number of new states to a particle?<p>Most of my understanding comes from a light reading of Nielsen-Chuang and Aaronson&#x27;s stuff. (A minor tangent: a theorem from computer science informs me that complex numbers aren&#x27;t needed if you&#x27;re willing to get a &quot;good enough approximation&quot; and polynomial blowup, but this paper argues complex numbers <i>are</i> necessary, even for finite/countable state spaces; I want to read the paper a bit closer to figure out where this discrepancy is).<p>This culminated in the following physics stackexchange question, which was probably not worded in the best way for the physics community[1]. I still don&#x27;t really understand any of the answers. Maybe someone on HN can elucidate it for me :)<p>[1]: <a href=""http://physics.stackexchange.com/questions/205742/what-experiment-supports-the-axiom-that-quantum-operations-are-reversible"" rel=""nofollow"">http://physics.stackexchange.com/questions/205742/what-exper...</a>",1442281960

If you complete 90% of a wind farm installation, you get 90% of the power out.  Completing 90% of a nuclear reactor gets you no power at all, and unexpected cost overruns can add up to billions of dollars.  When a reactor shuts down for repairs, they sometimes take decades to complete.  As of today, it can be argued that many countries&#x27; nuclear power programs were a financial mistake.<p>Then, once in a while, you find out that the original cost-benefit analysis was wrong.  After the Fukushima accident left $200 billion of real estate uninhabitable, nuclear power plants across the world have revised their risk models, and now are spending more money for safety upgrades.<p>Finally, emerging technologies like wind and solar are showing immense promise, but predicting their future cost is equally difficult.  All the best minds can only put together a very educated guess.<p>Yes, if we had started focusing on nuclear power 40 years ago -- and if we had done it carefully and properly the first time -- it would have been the right decision.<p>But we got it wrong, and the today risks of getting it wrong again are bigger than ever.",1442280813

10218419,comment,10213857,10215965,0,0,crimsonalucard,,,"Buddy, abstractions aren&#x27;t magic built on top of thin air. Abstractions can be built upon abstraction and can be built upon other abstractions but when you follow the supply chain all the way down to the logical conclusion you will hit a physical road block grounded in reality. Eventually there will be an abstraction that must be built on top of a concrete primitive.<p>What is this primitive thing at the end of the chain? Energy and material. Think about it. Your poet, in order to have the luxury of writing poetry instead of foraging for food must have physical requirements to assist in his writing of poetry. He must eat food, he must have shelter and materials to support his endeavor. When you give money away for poetry you are giving money away for concrete things. You are paying for his food, you are paying for his shelter, you are paying for his leisure time to allow him to practice his poetry. Food comes from plants, plants can only grow with sunlight... aka energy. Eventually the chain must end at a physical primitive.<p>Lets talk about a hypothetical island economy with a population of two people. Let&#x27;s say these two idiots are poets. You cannot have an economy of two poets where both poets pay each other to recite poetry. The poets will eventually die of starvation. It&#x27;s a mutually recursive abstraction that never ends and is unsustainable; An abstract infinite loop with no primitive at the root. TO fix: put a farmer on the island and have the farmer give food to the two poets in exchange for a recitation. Boom, there&#x27;s a real economy. An economy of pure abstraction only exists in your imagination and even your imagination needs food for sustenance.<p>So when we talk about economics, when we talk about programming, we are not talking about magical abstractions built upon nothing. We are talking about reality. An economy will always be bounded by the physical limitations of the world because abstractions are built on top of the physical world itself, the two are one and the same thing.<p>Ironically the primitive in economics is the exact same primitive in the programming universe: Energy and material are the same thing as Procedure and State. The philosophical implications are profound. Even crazier is when you follow the chain in the programming universe you will find out that both state and procedure are abstractions on the same thing: Silicon and electricity. What is silicon and electricity? Material and energy. Yes that&#x27;s right, not only is economics bounded by reality, but so is the world of programming, so is the concept of abstractions.",1442279177

Why is everything that we see natural, explained solely by the laws of physics?<p>It only takes one small faction within one advanced civilization to launch the self-replicating probes that will convert all matter in a galaxy into someone&#x27;s paradise, be that computronium or habitats or whatever. Most likely computronium, given the economics that drive expansion. Even the stars will be dismantled once it is economically viable to use their matter in another way.<p>The point here is that this engineering won&#x27;t look natural, even in its early stages, and it won&#x27;t look natural from a very, very long way away. Yet everything we see looks natural, out to the nearest 100,000 galaxies, a simply preposterous span of stars and planets to argue that no small factions capable of doing this have arisen. Yet do we see the evidence of their existence? We do not.<p><a href=""https://www.exratione.com/2015/05/the-cosmological-noocene/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.exratione.com/2015/05/the-cosmological-noocene/</a><p>Here is a sketch of the future, without any specific dates assigned to its milestones. The human mind is reverse engineered. It is run in software. A million variants and improvements are constructed. Molecular nanotechnology is established and becomes a mature industry, available to everyone. Anything and everything can be built efficiently given the raw materials and a spec. From an economic perspective those who thrive are those who make the most efficient use of the matter that they own, and those who gain control over the most matter: quality versus quantity shift back and forth in the degree of advantage as the ability to accurately and rapidly manipulate large masses of matter at the atomic level and lower grows. Matter is most economically efficient when incorporated as the workings of an intelligent entity. The end state here is a continuum of thinking matter, and there are countless arrangements by which matter might be made aware. Our evolved biology is among the least intricate and least capable of these possibilities. At the most efficient we might envisage space- and matter-efficient computational processors plus the necessary workings for support: communication, energy, repair, and so forth. The higher the fraction of that mix that can be devoted to data processing and transfer, the more economically effective the entities who use that system as a substrate.<p>Evolved intelligences are not rational actors in search of growth above all other goals. We have parks and entertainment industries, for example. There is no reason why constructed intelligences should be any different, but equally they have one important quality: they can change themselves and their progeny in defined ways to achieve defined outcomes in mental state. The alterations and experiments that provide economic advantages will prosper. Entities who choose to incorporate an urge to growth will become the majority. At some point the value of an asteroid, a moon, a planetary crust, or a star in its natural state falls below the value of the same matter dismantled and used as raw materials for computational processing. After that it is just a matter of time before this solar system, a wilderness at present, and a collection of parks in ages ahead, is transitioned into a more efficient arrangement of matter in which near every portion of the whole is intelligent. This change will propagate outward to other stellar systems, without end, driven by simple economic considerations. A sea of cultures of a complexity and scope beyond our imaginings, and our world today the tiniest mote of a seed, that could be emulated by the smallest discrete material unit of computational processing in that future substrate.<p>So it is less a matter of manifest destiny that we will convert our entire future light cone into intelligence, and more a matter of economic inevitability, the destination at the end of the random walk of choice simply because some classes of choice will be made more frequently than others. The outcome of human action writ large. All of this, however, indicates that there is something very important that we at present do not understand about the nature of reality. Nothing in our present situation as a species appears to be exceptional: stars are everywhere in vast numbers, planets also, and complex organic molecules are seen wherever we have the ability to observe them. Thus intelligence should arise elsewhere. The age of the universe is very long in comparison to the time taken for our spontaneous generation, yet we see no evidence that any other intelligence has come before us. This is often expressed as the Fermi Paradox, but is perhaps best thought of as the Wilderness Paradox, which is to ask why everything we observe, out to the very limits of the visible universe, is apparently natural and unaltered. Where are the signs of what we know is possible and inevitable for an intelligent evolved species, the conversion of matter to more efficient forms on a vast scale?<p>The only solid solution to the Fermi Paradox that does not require some new and presently missing piece of scientific understanding is the Simulation Argument: that we are in a box and walled off from the real world, whatever that might be, created by some demiurge for purposes guessable but ultimately unknowable through any action on our part. Prosaically that demiurge might be a descendant of a past humanity similar to ours, an entity that is running one of countless ancestor simulations for scientific reasons. Far less prosaic options are also possible, in which the demiurge is simulating from first principles a radically different cosmology from its own and thus its nature and motivations are inscrutable. These possibilities of the Simulation Argument are dissatisfying to explore, however, for all the same reasons as the brain in a jar thought experiment is a dead end. Best to assume it is not true, as it if is there is nothing useful you can do about it, individually or collectively. Pascal&#x27;s wager turned inside-out.<p>It is more interesting to speculate on what it is that we don&#x27;t understand at present about the nature of reality. There are numerous candidates, and most present thinking is directed towards those related to enforcing our rarity, often expressed as the Great Filter, one or more enormously unlikely steps that lie between the origin of a barren world scattered with a few organic compounds and the destination of an intelligent species engaged in repurposing of raw materials on a vast scale. All proposed Great Filters are very speculative; there is a great deal of room to argue about odds when you only have one example to work with, or events of the distant past must be reconstructed from theory, or future development of the species considered in detail rather than at a very high level, all which makes coming to any sort of rigorous conclusion next to impossible. All that is practical to achieve is to build the shape of the argument that would be sufficient if the actual numbers and proposed events in fact exist in reality. Given this uncertainty, any proposed Great Filter becomes an ever less satisfying answer the further we look outward and the more galaxies we see without any sign of massive engineering. It only serves to argue for our uniqueness, which is implausible given what we presently know and the isotropic nature of all other observed aspects of the natural universe across vast spans of distance and time.<p>Per our present understanding of physics and intelligent economic activity, we will turn every part of that great span into our descendants if not diverted or stopped by some outside influence, stars and all. The cosmological noocene, an ocean of intelligence. That the natural universe remains present to be used by us indicates that something is awry, however, that some vital and important understanding is missing, and as a species we are still just making the first fumbling explorations of the bounds of the possible with regards to what it is that we don&#x27;t know.",1442278996

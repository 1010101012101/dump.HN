3010475,comment,3010345,3010345,3,0,tabbyjabby,,,"We're working on integrating Redis into our stack, but we use  it mostly as a caching layer. As with any NoSQL datastore, your data will have to be structured far differently than if you were using a relational database. The nice thing about Redis is that it's a lot more effective than a simple key-value store for representing the data structures that exist in your application. If you're willing to put the time into learning this paradigm of data persistence the logical interaction with your data won't be a problem.<p>Redis does have a number of shortcomings. Firstly, it doesn't provide a very sophisticated transactions system. You get multi blocks, and the ability to watch keys (which is like a check and set), but you don't get true transactions. For example, there's no rollback mechanism, and commands will still be executed in a multi block if one of them fails.<p>Secondly, Redis by default does not provide strong guarantees of durability. It writes a snapshot to disk of your data periodically, so if something happens to the server that causes the program to shut down unexpectedly, you'll lose a lot of data. Redis can be configured to provide stronger guarantees of durability, but at the expense of speed.<p>Thirdly, there is currently no sharding mechanism built into Redis. They're working on Redis Cluster, which will allow your data to be spread across multiple servers, but it won't come out for sometime. You can build your own distribution system into your application however. You can read up on consistent hashing algorithms to help you with ideas for that.<p>Fourthly, everything is in memory at all times. That's pretty expensive, though Redis is quite efficient with memory usage.<p>Redis is really fast, which is awesome, but we still use MySQL as our primary datastore. We have a write-through/read-through caching layer, and if the transaction ever fails in part, we just rollback the MySQL transaction and invalidate the key in Redis, because we can trust that MySQL's records are more authoritative.",1316361460

What tempts programmers to become managers are companies with old-fashioned corporate structure, where the only way to advance in salary and prestige is to go into management.</i><p>I have to disagree with that. I've met many people, especially in larger enterprises, who started in development but then became more abstract over time. They weren't bad people, in fact, they were excellent at their job.<p>Programming to me has never been something that has to be continually pursued in order to stay fluent or able, but merely something that reflects your more basic skills and talents.<p>It's like playing a musical instrument. Almost anyone can learn playing the guitar, but it takes a special talent to excel at it. For the guitar this requires hearing, sense of rhythm, and others; for programming, this is analytical thinking, systematic thinking, and more. Some people will try to program but never be really good at it. I studied with people like that. It's not their fault, their skills are just in another area. Some others are great at it. Once they learned, it doesn't matter if they don't develop anything for 3 years; after their break, they look at a piece of code / framework / technology, understand what it does, and continue programming.<p>And the traits that make you a good programmer help you in other fields, even management. Yes, large corporations have structures, but we need structure to manage them. And we need managers. And a manager who was a distinguished developer will be much better suited for leading a team of developers -- even if he doesn't program any longer. This is a valid career path, and an interesting one at that.<p>My general opinion is that if you want to stay a programmer, find yourself a role where you can do that. If not, don't bother pursuing programming at all costs. It won't lead you in the right direction.",1316361034

Completely unhelpful, although not entirely unexpected.<p>If you want to learn a language with a strong developer community and is well suited to building web applications, either Ruby or Python would be good.

Did you try advertising this on iPhone Dev Sdk forums?<p>To be quite frank - I won't put any of my sources there until there is anything there already (not enough time to take chances with unknown sites).<p>Another thing - I think what prevents most of the developers from sharing their sources is insecurity about the quality of their source code. They think: ""cool, but I'd have to do SO MUCh work to make the source readable..""\nIf you could somehow make the site more friendly for less than perfect sources (for example - allow the developers to mark their sources quality, so someone with poorer quality code will just upload it and mark as poor quality, instead of waiting god-knows-how-long to clean up the code).\nI personally wouldn't mind buying poor quality code, but - as I said - plenty of developers will be ashamed to sell it.<p>Finally, a little bit of business advice - I suggest you focus on just one platform (iOS!:). The thing is - you NEED the critical mass for this site to work. If you focus all your strength on just one platform, you'll get to the point where you have a critical mass so much sooner. Handling PR/community building for just one platform is a full time job.<p>Also: read up about usability, because your site is lacking. The ""buy"" button is barely visible for example. Also - one of the main traffic sources for a site like yours will be (as much as I hate to admit it) SEO. Your site is so unoptimized - you could at least have more friendly URLs.\nPlus - avoid a syndrom of ""empty links"". You should minimize the amount of times user clicks a link and gets an empty page.\nRight now for example, you have a hundred categories on the right bar. Almost each one of them leads to an empty page - drop the categories until they are really necessary for navigation.<p>The site design is ugly as hell, but I think that's actually a good thing - don't bring in the designer before you have the business up and running... It's much harder to make serious changes to the site once the pro design is there.<p>Having said all that, I think there is a need for a site like this. Good luck!",1316359142

In spoken English we can use a wide variety of tones to indicate things like sarcasm or strong disagreement when asking a question. Translating this into written English isn't totally straightforward, but one common way of signalling these things is to use scare quotes[2]. In this way writing ""Why do you say its usually like that"" and ""Why do you say its 'usually' like that?"" have the same literal meaning but the later has a belligerent or sarcastic subtext. In general, if you don't want to come off as disagreeable you should never put quotes just around single words like usually, and especially not words or phrases that weren't actually used in the conversation like ""off die"" when questioning them.\n[2] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scare_quotes"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scare_quotes</a>",1316358767

Until this decision, the two pending applications for membership from outside geographical Europe, Israel's and Turkey's, had been stalled for quite a while. Now that Israel is in, there is a question of, what about Turkey? But that one is tied up in EU expansion politics; Turkey is also an EU membership candidate, and anti-Turkish-membership politicians don't want it admitted to other European organizations like CERN, for fear of strengthening the Turkey-is-European view.<p>There is also a longer-term question of what CERN (or perhaps other ""European"" institutions) should cover geographically. Why are they ""European"", and what does that mean? Could Egypt join, for example? One might say it's less ""culturally European"" than Israel, but its scientific community is quite western-oriented, and it already participates in some CERN projects on a case-by-case basis.",1316358745

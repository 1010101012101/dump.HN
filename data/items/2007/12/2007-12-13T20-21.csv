89299,comment,89200,89249,0,0,downer,,,"Ah, but interrupting business for personal <i>looks bad</i>; and the thing about (possibly most) women is they <i>want</i> you to have something that's more important than them.  If you drop everything for them they won't respect you.<p>So he did the right thing from both perspectives.  Which is probably why he's rich and has a (presumably) hot wife.<p>(I know that sounds politically incorrect, but alas, reality often is.   To be fair, it probably works both ways: a man won't respect a woman who drops everything for <i>him</i>, either.)",1197579112

89297,comment,89163,89204,0,0,michaelneale,,,"After spending some time with it, I personally can't find a way to make OO and functional mix in a nice way. I know some people say OO can be functional (in the sense that objects don't mutate) but that just looks aweful to me. Fortunately you can avoid the use of a lot of objects in scala anyway, so its not too much of a problem in practice.",1197578833
89296,comment,89055,89278,0,0,fauigerzigerk,,,"The prepaid card is a good idea. And I wonder whether it is always necessary to authorise individual payments. For something like newspaper articles, payments could be pooled and transferred en bloc via some kind clearing mechanism that doesn't require me to have an account with every magazine or website I read. The seller wouldn't even know who was paying and the clearing institution wouldn't know what exactly is being paid for. <p>The reason why nobody does it that way is probably that it's difficult to garantee settlement and the credit risk involved. But do we really need such a garantee in cases where no physical goods are delivered? Maybe it's enough if it works in 90 % of all cases. That's more than the rate of legally acquired software licenses today.",1197578822

89291,comment,89159,89185,0,0,boucher,,,"This approach is too simplistic to be useful in nearly any environment.  On top of that, its basically the exact opposite of what undo is/has always been.  <p>The ""correct"" way to do undo, is to perform an event, and keep a list of inverse events.  As you pop those off the undo stack, you can simply execute them.  <p>As you mentioned, this may be slightly more complicated in a multi-user environment -- but in this example, it would absolutely be the right way to go.  Plus, this is so easy to get working in javascript, where you can actually push functions to the stack, and then execute them when you pop them off...",1197577779

- WebCore-based (Safari, OmniWeb, Shiira)

- Gecko-based 1.9+ (Firefox 3 beta)<p>It is not supported by:
- Internet Explorer
- Firefox 2 (Current stable version)
- NetFront (PS3 browser)<p>So yes, technically IE is not the only browser that doesn't support it, but they are the only browser which has said that CSS compliance is not a priority for them.",1197577567

89287,comment,89168,89168,0,0,uuilly,,,"I played hockey for 22 years.  The beautiful thing about it is that fighting is the great equalizer.  There are unwritten rules that you must follow to avoid getting stomped by a toothless caveman.  For example, if you shadow their star player, you will get dropped.  If you are a 2000 lb goalie, you will get drawn into a fight and at least thrown out and at worst hurt.  Allowing a little fighting makes the game better b/c the rules don't have to be so explicit.  One goon willing to drop his gloves is a more effective way of toning down the dirty side-play than 10 more refs.",1197577450
89286,comment,89167,89167,0,0,johnrob,,,"A lot of people criticize facebook using the ""fad"" concept.  However, I find that hard to digest because of the investment we've all made in facebook.  We've got our friends in it, and we rely on it to stay abreast of what they are doing.  It has significant mindshare.  It is becoming an internet within the internet, if you factor in the percentage of time spent on facebook vs total time online.
Sure, this could all change.  Similar arguments have been made about eBay's hold on auctions, but nothing has dented their majority share yet.
My point is, UNLESS something big happens, facebook is going to be a major player.  If you argue for a downturn, you have to explain what this big thing is and why it will happen.  The burden of proof is on that side of the debate.",1197577317

89284,comment,88247,88247,0,0,dazzawazza,,,"I've deployed FreeBSD and OpenBSD as both front facing and back end systems. My only complaint has been lack of SMP support (to be fixed with FreeBSD7.0 at least, I'm not sure about OpenBSD). <p>People often complain about Ports but you soon get used to it and I've found the port maintainers to be helpful on the odd occasion when there has been a problem.<p>Although hardware support can be said to be weak, when choosing servers there aren't a lot of chip sets out there so things are mostly covered. Certainly when deploying to HP or Dell boxes I have had no problems. It only takes a few minutes to check h/w compatibility lists. Chosing the correct servers for any job requires careful research anyway.<p>The most annoying thing is explaining to people that although it's open, it's not Linux and yes it is production ready.",1197576938

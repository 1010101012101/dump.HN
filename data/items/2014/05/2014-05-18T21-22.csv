7764587,comment,7761313,7761618,1,0,mike_hearn,,,"Hi, I&#x27;m the author. Thanks for your interest! If you&#x27;d like to follow the project, you can sign up for email updates on vinumeris.com (they will be quite rare so don&#x27;t worry about being spammed).<p>Once launched, I plan to host a curated collection of projects for upgrades to Bitcoin and related software. In fact Lighthouse is partly software I&#x27;m writing for my own company, because that&#x27;s how I would like to make money - by implementing open source upgrades and raising the funds to pay for it through per-project assurance contracts.<p>As mentioned in the other replies, obviously a decentralised solution can&#x27;t have any central curation built in, but people are free to run their own curated collections of projects if they like. Often though, it won&#x27;t be necessary, because the creator of the project already has a good reputation and the reputation of an aggregator is inconsequential.<p>In other cases, the entire notion of curation may be irrelevant. Consider micro assurance contracts like someone who wants to rent out a house with a pool and organise a big party with friends there, but only if enough friends commit to going for the party to be fun. This would not be allowed on Kickstarter, but Lighthouse lets you do it by simply attaching the contract file to the announcement email. Replies can have the pledges attached (you can drag the pledges right out of the app into an email compose window). So this is the kind of ultra light weight contract that might be possible in future, when you have a totally decentralised solution.",1400450360

Instead I could imagine something more fine grained, a system where site owners could tag specific content within their site as coming from specific users.<p>Content tagged like this is neither endorsed nor disavowed, instead responsibility is pushed to the user who wrote the content. In other words site owners would be able to say something like this to search engines: &quot;this content is created by user X, don&#x27;t blame me if it&#x27;s spammy!&quot;.<p>Smart search engines could use this more fine-grained content ownership information in their search algorithms. That means they wouldn&#x27;t need to throw out <i>all</i> user contributed information on the internet just to protect the internet from spam.<p>There are a few challenges, of course. :)<p>* How to identify users? (Anonymously?)\n* How to have users endorse content on different sites?\n* How to work out which users are trustworthy?\n* Building a PageRank algorithm that incorporates fine-grained trust information.<p>But it&#x27;s fun to think about technical solutions.",1400450339
7764585,comment,7761486,7761486,4,0,colin_mccabe,,,"This article is a good overview-- one of the most informed I&#x27;ve seen from the HPC side of the world.<p>I don&#x27;t think &quot;HDFS is very slow and very obtuse&quot; is true, though.  If you use HDFS for what it was intended for-- reading large files that are mostly local-- it does pretty well.  MapReduce and Impala explicitly support this paradigm by looking at where files are and scheduling computation there.  If your workload has a ton of metadata operations, this can become a bottleneck, but that is not unique to HDFS.  For example, if you use &quot;ls&quot; with the wrong options on Lustre, things can get quite slow due to the large number of metadata operations generated:  <a href=""https://wikis.nyu.edu/display/NYUHPC/Lustre+FAQ"" rel=""nofollow"">https://wikis.nyu.edu/display/NYUHPC/Lustre+FAQ</a><p>Lustre is a cool filesystem in many ways, and has been battle-hardened for HPC.  However, I think Lustre is relatively unlikely to gain ground in Hadoop due to the complexity of administering and upgrading its in-kernel server.  Ceph might have a chance, though-- we&#x27;ll see.<p>The article also doesn&#x27;t discuss a lot of the areas in which Hadoop is way ahead.  Hadoop handles faults in individual nodes, rather than just assuming we will use gold-plated hardware with infalliable RAID.  Node failures happen, and HDFS and Hadoop can recover-- even from NameNode failures, these days.  Google&#x27;s Spanner paper points the way towards having strong consistency without sacrificing (as much) availability.<p>I agree that cramming traditional HPC problems into the Map-Reduce framework is not really a great idea.  Instead, it would be better to use something like Spark (which, to his credit, Lockwood mentions).  Spark is getting a huge amount of attention right now, and I think it&#x27;s going to resolve some of these issues.",1400450312

7764566,comment,7763720,7763908,5,0,dojomouse,,,"There are a couple of differences between this and Hyperloop.<p>1. The hyperloop white paper proposed air bearings as the levitation mechanism, rather than maglev. This could be swapped out without much change to the overall concept (and, in my opinion, should be if it&#x27;s ever built - maglev gives much more generous tolerances and ease of control).<p>2. The hyperloop anticipated a low vacuum; around 1/1000 atmospheres. While that sounds like not much air, it&#x27;s still quite a lot when you want to go around the speed of sound, especially if you want to do so in a tube; pressure builds up in front of the vehicle and causes huge drag. The hyperloop addressed this with an integrated compressor stage in the front of the vehicle; basically sucking in air to avoid the drag. This used quite a bit of power, required cooling, etc... and the resulting drag was still significant to the point that regular medium power &#x27;boosters&#x27; would be required along the track to keep the train at a reasonable speed. It also meant the speed was still limited, despite the partial vacuum, to around 1000kph (aircraft speeds).\nIf you want to get away without the compressor you need a much higher vacuum - I don&#x27;t know exactly where the equation changes but the number usually thrown around is about 1/100,000 atmospheres to 1/1,000,000 atmospheres. This is basically hard vacuum. If you can achieve it then it means no compressor, no significant onboard power source, and no meaningful limit to the top speed (you could go 2000 - 3000 km/h easy if you could make the track straight enough). The bad part is that, all else being equal, it&#x27;s roughly 100 times harder to make a vacuum of 1/100,000 atm than a vacuum of 1/1000 atm.\nSo... if you&#x27;re really confident you can build extremely well sealed tubes then you should go for the hard vacuum approach. If you&#x27;re confident you <i>can&#x27;t</i>, you should go for the low vacuum compressor approach. If you&#x27;re not sure, you should build a prototype :-)<p>The limitations regarding straight lines and the safety issues are roughly identical for the two concepts. The hyperloop is arguably less safe due to having a big spinning compressor right in front of you and a large onboard power source, high pressure steam storage etc.",1400449918

7764458,comment,7762413,7762413,2,0,blue11,,,"This was probably the best critique of Crossfit that I&#x27;ve read so far.  Personally, I&#x27;ve been doing Crossfit for 2+ years and I&#x27;ve got a lot out of it.  In fact, I have been in the best shape of my life because of it.  At the same time I&#x27;ve always had issues with some things.  For one, the nutrition principles that they advocate, basically the Paleo diet, is quite questionable in my opinion (although not really harmful , since it&#x27;s basically a low carbm, high protein diet).  And, yes, there are lot of practices that predispose to injuries.  In fact, I&#x27;m currently recovering from an injury that I am pretty sure I got at CF, although it wasn&#x27;t the type of injury that you can pinpoint to a particular moment.  Even though I believe that it was mostly my fault, because of bad form, and because of underestimating the damage for months and making it worse, at the same time it is true that the CF environment is such that it increases the chance of people injuring themselves.<p>However, this and other articles criticizing CF don&#x27;t really understand the appeal of CF to most of the people that go there.  The criticism is usually coming from serious athletes (and I use the word broadly to include professional athletes, semi-professional, and people that have always been just good at sports).  Guess what, most people are not athletes, they do not have the knowledge or the motivation to come up with a proper training program and execute it on their own, and they are easily discouraged when sports do not come naturally easy to them.  Most people are like me, they want to show up 3 times a week, do whatever workout has been prepared for them, and have an instructor advise them on what their doing.  There is not much out there that comes close to CF.  There are two big strengths of CF:  Variety and Accessibility.  Variety: CF is an all around training program, which might be bad for professional athletes, but it&#x27;s great for people who just want to be fit.  Where else would you go if you wanted to &quot;properly&quot; train on your own?  Regular gyms like 24-hour Fitness don&#x27;t have some of equipment like climbing ropes, GHD sit ups, pull-up bars (they might have one for the whole gym), and they have limited areas for doing things like barbell squats.  (There was recent story about a popular gym eliminating the squat frame because it was &quot;intimidating&quot;.)  Accessibility: CF welcomes _everyone_. The complaint that the WOD is one-size-fits-all is not quite valid.  Any exercise can be scaled down appropriately for each member.  That means reducing the weight, reducing the reps, exercise substitution (e.g, doing inclined push-ups for beginners, or doing 3 pull-ups & 3 dips instead of 1 muscle-up, etc.), reducing the workout length and so on.  That&#x27;s how everyone gets to do the WOD.  This is a big deal when you are a beginner!  Even if you can&#x27;t do a hand-stand or a musle-up, there are other things you can do and actually make progress.  An finally one other thing: price.  Yes, CF membership is expensive, but it is also several times cheaper than a personal trainer, and if you go to classes that are 5-12 people you basically have a trainer when you need one.<p>I&#x27;ve tried different things before, but nothing was as easy to follow or as effective as CF.  Right now I&#x27;m kind of worried about going back to CF after I recover, as I realize that the chance of getting another serious injury is significant.  But at the same time I don&#x27;t see anything else that has all the benefits.  I&#x27;d be kind of curious to hear if other people have found alternatives.  Most of the suggestions so far are a long of the lines what a motivated athlete would do, but they don&#x27;t work for people who just want to exercise casually for 5 hours a week and get a balanced workout.",1400447660

Get yourself put on a big, important project, and execute successfully on it.  How do you get yourself on a big important project?  Make yourself an expert within a department in one area, so that when that project is looking for people, they really need to have you.  For me that area was Javascript, although I also picked up a lot about all aspects of the search stack from working on a bunch of projects (this is the &quot;success begets success&quot; phenomena: if you&#x27;re an expert in one area, you can leverage that to get your pick of projects, which you can use to become an expert in more areas).

It doesn't mean the dictionary should be changed to accommodate that usage, right? I believe at least one American English dictionary now accepts nauseous as a synonym for nauseated.

2137160,comment,2136744,2137110,0,0,cletus,,,"> I'd suggest to keep working in the U.S. and invest in housing back in Australia.<p>As it happens I do own a house in Australia that is rented out but when you're paid in one currency and your costs are in another you open yourself up to exchange rate risk. So I'm way of overweighting myself in AUD liabilities. It's not a currency I'd be betting against in the next 10 years. Likewise, the USD looks like it'll only get weaker in the short to medium term. Pretty much every government here has a budget in deficit and you may find local and possibly even state governments defaulting in years to come.<p>The US governments (at every level) seem to have made the same mistake as many individuals: when times are good they simply increase spending to match or exceed revenue. When revenues drop they're in a bad position. The US has this huge Sword of Damacles hanging over its head in the form of Social Security. It's ultimately unsustainable in its present form. Everyone knows it. Nobody wants to do anything about it.<p>At least in Australia we've been moving towards funding our own retirements for decades. We're not there yet but we're a damn sight better off.<p>As for buying houses near the beach, not in any capital city I know about (except maybe Brisbane now). Certainly not Perth or Sydney. In Perth you'd have to go 50km+ north of the city to get anything remotely close to the beach for under $500k.<p>And the idea that property near the beach ""will never go down"" is exactly the kind of thinking that led to the subprime meltdown.<p>As for the Australian tax system, mine was't a criticism, merely an observation. Frankly I think any system that encourages people to create homes for others to rent as doing a public good. After all, when someone rents, somebody else by definition has to own that house.<p>One other difference worth pointing out between the US and Australia is that in Australia interest rates are typically variable. They move mostly in lockstep with the official (Reserve Bank) cash rate. You do get fixed mortgages but they're rarely for more than 5 years.<p>In the US, mortgages seem to be fixed for the 30 year life of the loan. This actually makes buying in the short to medium term attractive in the US as interest rates can only really go up. 4% fixed for 30 years is a hell of a deal.",1295909935

2137078,comment,2136744,2136744,0,0,Daisy,,,"Hi everyone,<p>Thanks for your feedback & questions. Just wanted to chime in and hopefully clarify the methodology that goes into Trulia's Rent vs. Buy Index. To make an apples-to-apples comparison, we only looked at the median list price and annualized median rent for two bedroom apartments, condos and townhouses in the 50 largest U.S. cities based on population. As such, this index does not look at single family homes.<p>To calculate the actual ratio, we divide the median list price by the annualized median rent. Here's a sample Price-to-Rent Ratio Calculation:\n---Median List Price: $140,201.37\n---Median Rent: $1,871.65\n---Price-to-rent ratio: $140,201.37 ÷ ($1,871.65 x 12) = 6<p>To interpret this ratio:\n----Price-to-Rent Ratio of 1-15: It is much less expensive to own than to rent a home in this city.\n----Price-to-Rent Ratio of 16-20: It is more expensive to own a home in this city. The total costs of ownership of a home in this city are greater than the costs of renting, but it might still make financial sense depending on the situation.\n----Price-to-Rent Ratio of 21+: The total costs of owning a home in this city are much greater than the costs of renting.<p>By using 15 as our baseline for the interpretation key as opposed to 12 (which would only account for a year's worth of rent), we are able to account for the additional costs such as property tax and homeowners insurance.<p>Of course, we understand that the decision to buy or to rent is a deeply personal decision based on ones unique financial situation. The Rent vs. Buy Index was designed to be a guide to help folks gauge whether it's more affordable to buy or to rent a home in one of the 50 largest cities.<p>Feel free to contact us with any additional questions. We love the lively conversation and appreciate everyone's comments.<p>Cheers!\nDaisy Kong\nPR Manager, Trulia\npr@trulia.com",1295908597

2137069,comment,2136744,2136744,0,0,cletus,,,"I'm from Australia but now live in NYC and I've been debating the question about whether to buy or rent. It's amusing to me to see a big red circle on this graphic for NYC. I can understand why.<p>NYC is a special case in many ways. For one thing, from a purely financial perspective, your best bet is to find a rent stabilized apartment that is well under market value and then invest your money elsewhere, possibly on buying a property you don't live in in NYC!<p>In Australia, buying property is a big thing. I'd imagine that in OECD rankings for home ownership, Australia ranks reasonably highly. Interestingly, the Guardian (in the UK) years ago did a study that showed that economic growth in Europe was inversely proportional to the rates of home ownership (meaning the countries with the highest rates of home ownership--eg Spain--had the worst performing economies and vice versa).<p>This makes a certain amount of sense: home ownership creates a less flexible labour market.<p>Anyway, in Australia, it's common to not only buy the property you live in but also investment properties. Investment properties are tax advantageous (in that the mortgage interest is a tax deduction) but you pay capital gains tax when you sell (but a good investment strategy will have you never selling; you just free up the equity to buy something else). The home you own is the reverse: mortgage interest is <i>not</i> tax deductible but your principal place of residence is capital gains tax free when you sell.<p>Now the thing about real estate is that it's a hedge against inflation. For example, 10 years ago you could buy a 3 bedroom house (built in the 70s) 10 miles from the city centre in Perth for <$100k. 5 years later? $350k <i>minimum</i>. There was a structural change in the economy that hasn't since reversed and doesn't look like ever reversing. Part of this was the increase in land cost but part of it is the increase in building cost (where once you could build a house for $80k, now anything less than $150-200k is unrealistic).<p>So if you'd rented in that time you would've missed out on that huge jump. Thing about real estate growth is that it is never smooth. It'll go through periods of high growth and others of stagnant prices if not negative price growth. So it's a long term investment (typically 7+ years).<p>But the real estate market in Australia is highly speculative.<p>I say that because I've also lived in Switzerland, which has an almost planned economy. The tax system stamps out property speculation, arguing that it is in the common good to have affordable housing. This is an opinion that I think has merit. To give you an example, if you sell a property within 2 years of buying it, the capital gains tax is 100% (iirc), meaning the entire gain is taxed.<p>Anyway, back to NYC. NYC has a lot going for it from a real estate perspective. It's a center for jobs but also land is a finite resource here. Manhattan isn't getting any bigger. Most industrial areas have already been converted to residential (or, more accurately, mixed residential/commercial). Manhattan is mostly gentrified now.<p>Betting on a limited resource is typically a good plan but the difference between renting and buying is huge here. Like a 1BR that might cost $2000 to rent will probably cost >$500K to buy and have significant ($300-600/month) maintenance fees to boot.<p>I really don't understand what motivates investors for that kind of return. So something will change in the future but will prices come down (or just stagnate for years) or will rents go up? If it's the former, rent. If it's the latter, buy.<p>So I'm really torn on whether I should position myself to buy in the future or simply resign myself to renting. At this stage I'll probably rent just because I may move around with my employer (Google) but I must admit: the prospect of owning an apartment in Manhattan <i>is</i> appealling.",1295908454

I actually have an old blackberry, and will likely get an android whenever that gives up the ghost. I have a handful of games that I play on it (none of them very good) when waiting for a train, or similar smaller diversions.<p>I have used them, and I work around people who use them and play games. I am aware that the list was not great, a similarly thrown together list of the ""best"" NDS games would be better.<p>I would love to see a current top 25 with the actual best iOS games. I would like to see how many of those are exclusives (which nixes plants vs zombies and angry birds). And yeah, ""good"" and ""great"" are subjective, but the crowd of people buying ""the oregon trail"" are most likely buying it because they played it in 3rd grade and its a nostalgia trip, not because of its ""gameplay"", and I would wager most of those install just get a few runs until people realize how dull and tedious it is.<p>Now, all that being said, I do have a DS, Wii, PS3 and 360, a haphazard steam collection. On top of that I am at level 21 on kongregate, so I have played a _lot_ of casual and flash based games, and I still play them. The wii gets the least amount of play of any of those (basically just a dedicated netflix streamer at this point). My points are not to come across as a nintendo fanboy (though thats not an unfair thing to say), but as a gaming platform, the DS offers quite a lot that is not obvious. It is a dedicated gaming platform, and people who are looking for that will still want it even _if_ they already have an ipod. It will be the only place where you can get mario, and pokemon, zelda, and layton, and phoenix wright, for a long while.<p>The online stores for the various consoles (and steam) are packed with games for under $5, that doesn't stop people from lining up at midnight to plunk down $60 for the next call of duty.<p>The reason? The games are _that_ much better, and the people who care and play those games know the difference.<p>> I now I've sat there and played Angry Birds for an hour.\nMe too. Angry birds is decent (have it for ps3 -- bug screen w00+!), with a lot of levels (i'm about 65% through the levels, though not trying to get 3 stars). Its still a really basic game, the production values are low and is decidedly ""casual"".<p>That, and it seems that it is your example for a good game, and seems to have taken the throne from plants vs zombies. Cool, so as a gamer, if I want a portable system, what do I get after that?<p>It literally took me a couple _years_ to get through the whole phoenix wright series (5 games). Thats playing regularly, but not daily, and many sessions of more than an hour. This is for a largely text/dialogue based game with point-and-click adventure elements. There were other things I played as well, and there are a lot of options after that.<p>Maybe my opinions show that I don't have a complete understanding of ""mobile gaming"", but you seem to not really understand ""gaming"" in general. And I am <i>not</i> even a hardcore gamer.<p>>> ... with a better attitude towards their customers\n> I think your bias is showing here.<p>Here is a real simple example:\nWhen the wii came out there were some problems: the straps were too weak, and the gyro at the tip of the wii-mote was fragile. Nintendo came out, acknowledged it, fixed it with future production and sent out free replacements and cases for all their current models without question.<p>Apple released a new iPhone with a known reception problem, Jobs said ""just don't hold it that way"". Eventually, they grudgingly offered a refund on a case, never admitting there was a problem and blaming the users.<p>Or maybe look at the huge amount of fan remakes, hacks, fan-art, and dedications to nintendo and their cultural impact. Then consider that apple was suing its fans for using the term 'podcast', when the term itself is in reverence to the ipod itself.<p>Not to mention that they supported and would service replace ALL of their hardware until ~2007 (with the wii virtual console, they finally EOL'd support for the NES/SNES).<p>Anecdotally, when I was in high school they replaced a 10 year old controller with a brand new one for free when I took it in for repair. Also, I don't know any 10 year olds, and I don't know anyone who owns an iPod touch (but quite a few with iPhones). I know lots of people with DS's, even the ones that aren't serious gamers. I have one friend that has two, just to play mario kart, and the second so a friend can play along.<p>> True but, in the phone market as one example, I'd rather be Apple than, say, Nokia or RIM.<p>I agree, and I'd rather be Nintendo than THQ or Sega.<p>An install base of 135 million is nothing to sneeze at, and people have been second guessing and trying to bury nintendo for 25 years, ever since they reinvented the console and proved there was a market there in the early 80s.<p>Apple will have its share of success, but nintendo knows how to make and sell games better than _anyone_, and they know how to do it while widening its audience and making a profit on every piece of hardware sold.<p>In the end, I'm really just pointing out that Apple is entering a market where they have been traditionally weak (games), with a competitor that is traditionally very strong, with a long track record of success, and a phenomenally large install base, yet the prevailing HN attitude is that they should be shaking in their boots.<p>Games make the system, not processing power, or hardware specs, or ""retina vision"", or whatever else. This has been proven time and time again. iOS has a few fun casual games that are popular, but they are in a race to the bottom with prices that for the most part have not pulled in support for major studios or flagship games. That is not to say that they never will, but the mobile market as it is is decidedly casual and geared toward small studios.",1295907476

I think several of your feedback points are things that we need to clarify to users, because we feel like there is definitely a significant value proposition to users. For example:<p>-Managing multiple registries at multiple stores is a pain. Automatic sync helps alleviate that headache.<p>-We allow people to add any item on the web or with a barcode. Now you can register for a random item at a random store without having to set up a whole registry there (if they even offer the option).<p>-We do price comparisons on each product. Other players just aggregate your registries, but don't detect that you might have the same exact mixer at Target and Bed Bath & Beyond. This way, we can show guests where the mixer is the cheapest -- you don't care where it comes from.<p>As far as making money, we use affiliate links for any product at stores with affiliate programs. Fortunately, Amazon tends to be cheapest for most products and has a good affiliate program.<p>Thanks again for the feedback.",1295906424

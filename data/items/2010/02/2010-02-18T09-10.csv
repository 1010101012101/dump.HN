I used KALI for the IPX over TCP/IP emulation to play online through my 14.4 modem.<p>Anyways, I had gotten really good at playing the game online, thanks to Schlonglor's guides along with lots of practice.<p>One day I had just finished playing a game, and beat the other person.  I started chatting when them, when they told me that they were pretty new to Warcraft II.  I asked how they got into it, and she told me, her brother was the Schlonglor!  At first I was floored.  I couldn't believe it.  We talked for quite awhile, and then shes tells me that her brother is there.  She then asked if I would like to play against him.  Of course I accepted!<p>My hands were literally shaking at the thought of playing against one of Warcraft II idols.  We start playing, and I work faster and harder that I've ever played in a game.<p>I instantly could tell this guy was him, because the way he played was exactly like all the screenshots I had memorized of his games. (Wayyyy before YouTube, so there were no videos.)<p>The game progressed, and long(ish) story short, he made some heavy attacks on me, killed my base, and assume he had won.  Moments later, my real army and real base that I was hiding moved in, and crushed him.<p>He was asking me.. ""How did you do that??"" ""Where did that all come from??""  I had the most s$%t-eating grin on my face.  I was so proud that I had beat him.<p>He then tells me that he hasn't play for the last few weeks, and was out of practice.  I didn't care.. I had still just beaten the Schlonglor!!<p>Him and I proceeded to chat it up for awhile.  He congratulated me on the win, we parted ways, and I never heard from him again.<p>Soon after I put down the game, figuring there was no way to really beat that experience.<p>Good memories.. Thanks for bringing them up Alex :)",1266485919

1133792,comment,1129797,1132185,0,0,ErrantX,,,"> When accusing someone of a crime that serious you tread with care. There is no 'undo' button on that operation.<p>Agreed. Im of the opinion we can only deal with the facts of the case; and we have very few of those. Random scenario: he refused to answer questions (for example on the advice of a lawyer) or provide an alibi (I know I am making that up - but things can slant this either way).<p>> after all, simply monitoring them would give you hard proof<p>There are strong arguments against that. Firstly, of course, cost. Secondly the privacy argument (could you imagine the fuss if it turned out the police were monitoring potential suspects secretly? :P).<p>> In the current system you might as well be guilty, even when you are not.<p>Agreed. I think this is a general problem with the society as well as the system. Im not sure why this investigation was not confidential - most are. Indeed most of those accused and cleared of CP offences are not generally affected (according to the references I have read at least; which are solid, but I admit not my first hand knowledge).<p>> I can sneak large numbers of files on to your computer<p>Ofc. Those sort of cases are difficult. We do get cases which come in where a girl has accused an older male of abuse and looking at child porn where the officer has noted they think she may be maliciously lying. The problem is how do you prove things like that - the best way is to grab his machine and have a look for solid physical evidence then go from there.<p>I dont think you could accuse someone anonymously quite like you suggest and have them arrested straight away.<p>In this case the CC payment is tangible. In retrospect your probably right and they should have taken more care in investigating his alibi (if he gave it) before pushing the case one. But again we have no information on the sequence of events and who did what - so ultimately all of this is speculation :)",1266485596

Nice :-) And love the clean simplicity - it's like the google of timezone converters. :-)<p>- But it wasn't obvious that it would autocomplete - nice to have <i>a</i> drop-down even before typing, just to show the user. Or maybe just a couple of e.gs. (like google calendar's ""breakfast at tiffany's"").<p>- Also not obvious that you can change both times (I mean, it <i>should</i> work that way, but software <i>never</i> does, apart from languages - and I think that it wouldn't even occur to ordinary folk that it might).<p>Might be worth doing some user-testing (where you watch them, like ""Step 2. Validate"" in <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1132980"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1132980</a>).<p>You can probably get some adwords revenue.

This is partially our fault; people are just expected to grab a computer and automatically understand things, and as a group software developers really should start things off with an introduction.<p>However, in my experience, most people are not willing to learn about their computers if you give them the chance. They're entirely apathetic about the whole deal. They don't care about anything, they just want to get Facebook and Farmville and be done with it. From this perspective, the iPad is _too_ open, and should come with a pre-programmed list of allowed domains to prevent phishing or other scams.",1266483714

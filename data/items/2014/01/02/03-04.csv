6998108,comment,6997796,6998046,2,0,mjn,,,"> It is always the way with military projects. Well, not quite always.<p>There were a few generations of military projects that, while very expensive and subject to many of the same distributed-construction politics, did seem to turn out well in the end. More recent ones (meaning the last 10-20 years) seem not to be doing as well. The F-16 program, for example, was led by the U.S. but pulled in several NATO allies from Europe as part of the program, and as part of that deal the construction was also split up between the partners. But all the partners were generally happy with the end result, and the F-16 is well regarded. Something vaguely similar was tried with the Joint Strike Fighter, but that one doesn&#x27;t seem to be going as well, and a lot of the non-U.S. partners are now starting to regret having signed up for it. I don&#x27;t know enough to explain why the F-16 process worked, though.",1388634950

In that regard LCS is not a change.<p>We quite openly referred to our FFGs (the most capable warship LCS is to replace) as &quot;missile/torpedo sponges&quot; to protect the &quot;high value units&quot; the FFG was to escort. The other types of missions LCS is supposed to take on are handled today by even less capable craft (e.g. the MCMs doing minesweeping for us today could be sunk by any random nation&#x27;s coast guard).<p>But even ignoring &#x27;tin can&#x27; destroyers/frigates in the guided missile age, Naval strategy since the time of Alfred Mahan has been for combat to be between major fleet vessels on either side with smaller ships simply playing a harassing or auxiliary role.<p>The idea is that if you can destroy <i>their</i> big decks, then their remaining little decks couldn&#x27;t appreciably resist your remaining big decks anyways. The experience of WWII actually served to mostly bear this theory out (in the context of fleet-on-fleet engagements) except that the carrier became the most destructive ship afloat, not the battleship.<p>So it makes sense that LCS is not expected to be survivable. I think a lot of the confusion might come from the idea that people hear so much about LCS that they expect it&#x27;s some kind of very powerful upcoming warship, which is not the case at all. It&#x27;s nothing more than a modern frigate, which is about the smallest kind of surface ship that has any right to be called a &quot;real warship&quot; at all.",1388633703

The program for the &#x27;LTS&#x27; ships is split between Lockheed Martin and General Dynamics, Austal are partnered up with General Dynamics building a very different design of ship to what the other guys at Lockheed Martin are doing.<p>This particular ship was supposed to cost $220 million dollars, it is now costing more than $700 million. That is a lot of money. The program as a whole is costing something like $80 billion, that really is a lot of money.<p>What I find amusing is that a contract for $300 million has been awarded for some company to create the training materials for the LTS ships. That is one very expensive operators manual.<p>Incidentally the Lockheed Martin LCS ships crack when going at speed, well, that has been the problem so far. So you have half the fleet corroding and the other half just cracking.

Austal USA, Independence‘s Alabama-based builder, calls it “galvanic corrosion.” Civilian scientists know it as “electrolysis.” It’s what occurs when “two dissimilar metals, after being in electrical contact with one another, corrode at different rates,” Austal explained in a statement.</i><p>First, it&#x27;s strange to distinguish what the &quot;civilian&quot; term is, because there isn&#x27;t any military/civilian terminology difference here that I know of. The standard civilian term for this kind of corrosion is also &quot;galvanic corrosion&quot;. It&#x27;s a common issue in water pipes, when there are joints between different kinds of metals (commonly steel pipes with copper joints).<p>Secondly, electrolysis isn&#x27;t the same thing as galvanic corrosion. Galvanic corrosion requires only the dissimilar metals in contact, immersed in an electrolyte (the situation here). Electrolysis is a more general process, but in the context of corrosion, it refers to corrosion driven by an external current, usually some kind of stray electrical contact.

DoerHub is designed to help people do more together - to enable serendipity and power meaningful projects <a href""http://www.doerhub.co"" rel""nofollo"">http://www.doerhub.com</a> and <a href""http://www.doerhub.com/for/doerhu"" rel""nofollo"">http://www.doerhub.com/for/doerhub</a> .<p>I&#x27;ve had more ups and downs than I can count - several potential cofounders who didn&#x27;t work out, moving solo to the Bay area, trying to survive school in parallel because it is tremendously helpful to the business, etc.<p>At the end of the day, I see this as a my masterpiece - every peace of it is built with love and I am testing the impact of each new component as I go to make sure I&#x27;m heading in the right direction. I start a new piece of functionality every day and don&#x27;t go to bed until it&#x27;s done. When I hit a wall with coding, I do biz dev or something else. Resting from one to do the other. I catch myself thinking about DoerHub even when I am supposed to rest - and solving problems in my head during the most mundane everyday tasks. I have a long roadmap and the peaces are falling like dominos when I focus (first release, boosting conversion on homepage, boosting internal engagement, adding a viral feature, seeing numbers go up or applying scenario B when they don&#x27;t, boosting performance, adding another needed component, etc). It feels like a long game I am conquering one level at a time.<p>I have met many smart people who had the skills to help, but at the end of the day, it comes down to persistence and commitment - your ability to bite down on something and not let go. So many talented people are stuck doing things just to get by, to get a bigger pay check, to get rich. Unless you love what you are doing, the people who are using your work will not feel the love in it either so it becomes a doomed endeavour. That is why I push forward relentlessly, even as a solo founder, I love what I am doing and the users can see that.<p>I need a co-founder and when someone comes along who wants to join me and has the skills I simply ask that they build one of the next pieces on the roadmap independently. You can&#x27;t be a co-founder unless you are capable of carrying a piece of the business forward on your own. If they take too long or give up midway, we&#x27;ve saved each other a lot of time and can remain friends. In the mean time, I just keep on trucking. Crafting DoerHub with love and watching users benefit from my work daily. I will be doing this for years to come, and somewhere along the way I will find someone who wants to do it with me and is just as stubborn. Probably one of DoerHub&#x27;s users (which is why I only promote the site within groups of amazing doers).",1388632280

Charges made go against the bank account directly (and any line of credit which may be attached thereto).<p>You can use it in either debit or credit mode. In debit mode, you swipe and input your PIN, and the charge request, including the encrypted PIN, goes over the <i>debit</i> network to your bank, which debits your account in real time more or less. In <i>credit</i> mode, you merely swipe and sign, and the charge goes over the credit network, reaching your bank somewhat later. In neither case is it really a credit card, unless you have and use an attached line of credit. Most check cards don&#x27;t have lines of credit.<p>Some years ago, my bank switched their ATM cards to check cards. When I got my new card and saw the Visa logo and read the brochure, I called the bank and asked if the card could be used to make payments without entering the PIN.

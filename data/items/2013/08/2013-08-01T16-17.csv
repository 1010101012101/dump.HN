6141681,comment,6139606,6141447,4,0,Homunculiheaded,,,"History has shown that given power people abuse it, the set up of mass, warrantless, surveillance is itself evidence of this, a feared consequence of the Patriot Act.  It is a completely rational fear that given increasing powers government will increasingly abuse them.  Also there has been nothing in recent policy that at all demonstrates that the federal government will ever relinquish power once given it. The more power that the government takes without challenge or checks and balances,  the more it can easily take in the future. It&#x27;s a positive feedback system.<p>&quot;Terrorism&quot; on the other hand does not scale, especially with an adversary so technologically limited oceans away from US borders. Terrorism isn&#x27;t even meant to scale, it&#x27;s entire purpose to create a maximal psychological impact because the adversary does not have the resources to achieve any significant damage through force. Even if you look at Isreal&#x27;s total deaths and injuries from terrorist attacks you&#x27;ll see that the numbers are small [0,1]. Also, unlike increasing government powers, there is no evidence that terrorists acts on US soil are increasing.<p>[0] <a href=""http://www.johnstonsarchive.net/terrorism/terrisraelsum.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.johnstonsarchive.net/terrorism/terrisraelsum.html</a>

No nuance is necessary but there are no nuances to perceive in this system.<p>This is, of course, why the system is not suitable for general implementation. It will be quickly and immediately co-opted by those who <i>can</i> perceive nuance where others see only black/white, who will eventually bring the whole edifice crashing back down again.",1375376326

You may need to acquire supplies and transport yourself to a pickup site, but they typically provide food and tools.<p>This does three things: It gets you out of the office and away from your email. (When doing what I call an &quot;away trip&quot; -- yes, nerdy -- I have either put my smart phone&#x27;s SIM card into a dumb phone or given everyone a separate phone number to reach me at a prepaid cell phone. I leave the phone off the majority of the time, and instruct them to leave a voicemail and I will call them back when I get around to it.) It gets you away from the cycle of HN, Reddit, and other news sites. And last, it gives you something tangible that you can look back and say that you built.<p>Trips I&#x27;ve done have included building mountain bike trails, gathering a large group of friends from a small HN-like forum to help clean out a forum member&#x27;s estranged mother&#x27;s house.

Eight people sorted and moved enough stuff out to fill 40 cu. yd. dumpster per day, and fixed enough of the plumbing issues to prevent further damage to the house.

Apparently, it&#x27;s not easy enough.</i><p>The substantive criticism I saw here was the one about versioning packages, which I think has led to some of the awkward choices. If you&#x27;re collaborating and using packages from github etc (as go get encourages you to do), it isn&#x27;t possible to document which version you&#x27;re using so that go get will fetch one version till you decide to upgrade everyone. You have to freeze the dependencies somehow by hand (which is mostly what has led the author beyond the pale).<p>If this is seen as not a problem Go wants to solve, perhaps it should be documented up front, as it&#x27;s something which comes up again and again when people start using Go coming from languages with an established package ecosystem. Almost every other language I can think of versions libraries explicitly, so Go is quite unusual in this regard. For example under &#x27;Remote packages&#x27; in that page you link, there is no mention of versions at all.",1375375515

FBI, Internal Task Force, MIB, it really doesn&#x27;t matter that much.<p>3) Were they merely concerned with Pressure cookers, backpacks, and quinoa.  That is all just conjecture and really not relevant to the story.<p>The REAL issue here is that government agents appeared on her doorstep and asked to come in, for no apparent reason.  Then they asked a bunch of questions that made her feel as if she was a suspicious character.  This all causes an atmosphere of fear, similar to what special police units in other countries have done.<p>This is about the fact that she doesn&#x27;t know WHY they came by.  Sure she&#x27;s speculating to make herself feel better, who wouldn&#x27;t but what&#x27;s more important is that there is someone watching you out there and determining if a person is suspicious or not and we (US citizens) have NO control over that.  Matter of fact we don&#x27;t even know what it is all about.<p>Did she make this story up.  Sure, in part.

Where&#x27;s the 3D rendering of Relativity that makes E=MC2 perfectly comprehensible for the masses? Or is that defeatist?<p>Neither is the problem with representation. We&#x27;ve had 3D visualization for years -- spaghetti flying at you in perfectly rendered HD 3D is still spaghetti.<p>The problem is not with the technology, but in the subjective perception of complex domains, and the real world fact that codebases tend to be more unclear than not, acquire massive amounts of technical debt, and even the cleanest codebases, in pure Uncle Bob and GOF-approved architectural clarity, present a cognitive domain that requires a lot of specialization to understand.<p>It&#x27;s like saying -- what if the problem with understanding French is that we need better visual representations of French? Cool -- that might help the French and other Francophiles, but it doesn&#x27;t remove the conceptual barrier and basic training required to understand the underlying language.<p>Likewise, if I presented you with a perfect 3D model (whatever that means) of my pub/sub solution built with a Reactor Pattern that messages N number of clients and takes asynchronous events from N number of other clients and persists the results of processing those messages in a sorting algorithm to a key-sorted Hash inside a NoSQL store -- you&#x27;d still have to have the conceptual vocabulary and experience to have any idea what was going on.<p>In other words, the issue is not an extrinsic problem that needs innovation, but a subjective problem of conceptualization that floats independent of language and implementation.<p>I love Steve Jobs&#x27; attitude and take inspiration from it -- he put user experience and elegance over the needs of programmers. But let&#x27;s stay with Jobs for a minute. Because he was focused on user-centric experiences, the tools he left developers were serviceable but mostly afterthoughts. It was up to coders to service tools, not the other way around. XCode is not widely admired as an IDE, Objective-C is a good language but has its warts, and in general Jobs himself didn&#x27;t see the biggest challenge as technical or code-centric, his innovations were mainly a finely-tuned intuition for the difference between elegant and simplistic, combined with a will, attention to detail and leadership drive to make those intuitions reality. He simplified touch interfaces, and left coders mostly to their own challenges, and I think he was right on with those priorities. In that, he totally &quot;shared my attitude&quot;.<p>I <i>do</i> have an open mind, or I wouldn&#x27;t still be coding and pushing myself to learn decades after scribbling out my first lines of BASIC on a TRS-80. But I also have enough experience with many, many codebases and have spent years learning techniques for simplifying and expressing complex domain problems. And the class of visual representation of those domains, of which NoFlo is just one more iteration, has very limited utility in that regard.<p>Is it possible that a better visual vocabulary for code will come along?

I have a good amount of experience analyzing data models and use cases to determine API structure, architecture, and recommended implementation. I know the ins and outs of REST vs RPC, JSON vs XML, and hypermedia vs traditional. I&#x27;ve implemented APIs using Rails, Node.js, and Java platforms. Bottom line - if you need an API developed, I can take you through the process from start to finish.<p>Single-Page JS App Development -  I&#x27;ve led development on multiple single-page JavaScript apps in both desktop and mobile environments. I have significant JavaScript experience and have build full applications using Backbone.js and Ember.js. Recently I&#x27;ve been working with Balanced Payments to build a web interface for their payments platform using Ember.js. The whole project is open source - check it out! <a href=""https://github.com/balanced/balanced-dashboard"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/balanced/balanced-dashboard</a><p>Mobile App Development - I&#x27;ve deployed multiple apps across iOS and Android platforms for phones and tablets. I&#x27;m experienced in both native (iOS, Android) and mobile cross-platform HTML (Sencha Touch, JQuery Mobile) development.<p>Traditional Web Development - While I&#x27;ve spent most of my time lately working on APIs and API-driven apps, I also have ten years of experience doing traditional server-side web development.

We know that the searches were made WITHIN the same week. This factor could possibly give us stronger signals for a profile-match.<p>Now what if we couple that with &#x27;international travel&#x27;(e.g. how often a passport was used in a system for out-of-country travel)? The profile match would become higher due to the husbands business trips.<p>And I don&#x27;t know where these people live, but location could also be a factor as well (e.g. the closer you live to a major city the greater your risk potential factor).<p>Now the cross-section for these factors would have such precision that doing a dragnet on this profile-match set would be feasible.

Youll get to work on challenging technical problems alongside a small but driven group of developers, and play a key role in shaping both the product and team culture.<p>IFTTTs mission is to help people to create connections between the services and devices they use every day. Weve built a system that enables users to set up simple if this, then that-style recipes, which allow activity from one web service to trigger activity in another. The current system supports over 60 unique services and runs nearly a hundred million recipe-handling tasks per day, and we plan to dramatically expand on our flexibility and scalability. Under the hood, this translates to building a platform that can talk to and move data between virtually any API you can think of, all in realtime and at massive scale.<p>We&#x27;re well funded, and we work hard to do right by our employees. New hires at IFTTT enjoy competitive salary and equity, full benefits, sane work schedules, and a flexible vacation policy. Much more than that, we offer interesting, deep projects and an amazing team experience.

What it requires is a separate rendering layer that isn&#x27;t subject to any GC pauses (or a game-like rendering loop that&#x27;s always on time). The managed code manipulates the declarative level of the animations, and the low level handles the frame-by-frame details.</i><p>I don&#x27;t think this is true. It&#x27;s considerably more than rendering--it&#x27;s reactivity. You need to handle audio streaming without pause, be able to process <i>and dispatch</i> input events seamlessly as well (I don&#x27;t even know how you&#x27;d do this), so on and so forth. You&#x27;ll essentially need to pull <i>everything</i> except actor logic out of the Java layer. Even some of that will be latency-constrained.<p>If anything, I think Unity is on the right path here: embed a sufficiently optimized virtual machine inside an engine that does all the hard work. But Unity still suffers from serious perf issues with nontrivial scenes. Like I said in another reply to you, object pooling is still heavily used in Unity because of the costs of object creation and destruction.<p><i>> On relatively small heap sizes (under a GB) GC on recent PC hardware usually fits into the equivalent of a single frame -- under 30 milliseconds. Concurrent collectors would rarely need anything more than that, and wouldn&#x27;t stop the world in any case.</i><p>Sure, but that&#x27;s too slow. The human eye can easily, <i>easily</i>, detect a dropped frame. Concurrent collectors (you mean Azul and friends?) are a possibility but we&#x27;d need a portable one that&#x27;s freely licensed. If you&#x27;ve got one in your back pocket...gimme. =)<p><i>> The question here is, can you build a stable high performance rendering system on the JVM? If not, what would you have to change to be able to do that?</i><p>This is a tricky question. My instant reaction--&quot;you can&#x27;t&quot;--feels right for the current state of the JVM. I do think something like Azul or another fully concurrent collector helps. But even then the JVM just has its limitations. Like, you&#x27;re going to blow up your cache iterating a list of whatever your &quot;GLbuffer&quot; analogues are, unless you decompose all your objects. In most games way more of your code ends up being engine code than game logic code and so you&#x27;re kind of hosing the main reason to use the JVM: a mostly-clean object-based system.<p>At that point, I&#x27;d just write C++ and embed a scripting language. (Recurring theme!)<p><i>> And JMonkeyEngine shows you can do a lot with what&#x27;s there right now.</i><p>JMonkeyEngine is actually a major reason why I&#x27;m not using the JVM--if they can&#x27;t get it good enough, I sure won&#x27;t, right? IMO, you don&#x27;t <i>get</i> enough from using the JVM (unless that&#x27;s all you know, which&#x27;d just be sort of a shame) to make up for its limited platform reach and its perf issues. What you can do with it, right now, relative to just sucking it up  and writing some C++ (and I do mean &quot;sucking it up&quot;, I hate writing C++), just isn&#x27;t enough.",1375373398

I&#x27;m trying to dispel the notion that as long as &quot;only&quot; a few thousand people are dying annually, then the rational response is to treat terrorism with no more seriousness than anything else that kills a few thousand people each year, such as ladders.<p>My point is that treating it as any other spree or serial killing is rational - we already have mechanisms to deal with these kinds of events, including laws about the use of &quot;weapons of mass destruction&quot;, etc.<p>The whole point of terrorism is to provoke a reaction outside of that normal process and get people to react to the terror... causing an allergy-style overreaction from the populace, much like we saw from 9/11 in the US.<p>So the rational response IS to simply go &quot;ho-hum&quot; and treat it as just another criminal act. Taking the cowardly path of &quot;something scared me, spite it with full power phasers!&quot; is what the terrorists wants, and is ultimately self-defeating.<p>Comparing it to more dangerous things - things that are statistically more likely to kill you - is a way to fight against our animalistic panic to smash! kill! destroy! the thing causing fear, and demonstrate that it is just fear we&#x27;re responding to, rather than a rational danger.<p>tl;dr: Spending the privacy and civil rights we have on stopping the fear caused by terrorism is the height of cowardice and irrationality.",1375372986

Aircloak is a young and well-funded startup working on privacy preserving data processing and analytics. We are a spinout from the German Max-Planck Institute for Software System research institute, where we also currently have our offices.<p>Our technology allows us to process highly private streams of data and only ever make fully anonymous data available to our customers. One of the features that make our system unique is that no one, including operators, customers, and ourselves, ever has access to the sensitive raw data. This property holds true even after we update the software running on the machines processing the sensitive data!<p>You should:<p><pre><code>    - be intelligent
    - have a good sense of humour
    - be an amazing programmer
    - wish to change the world
</code></pre>
Our system spans many machines and services, with major components written in Erlang and Java, in addition to components written in C, C# and ruby. Knowledge of functional programming is a plus. Experience with web development is not going to hurt either.<p>We are:<p><pre><code>    - recent University of Cambridge graduates 
    - one director at the Max-Planck Institute
</code></pre>
The work environment is highly international and diverse, and we would like to keep it that way. We are looking to hire two more full time engineers. You can either work on site with us in our offices in Kaiserslautern, Germany, or, for the right candidate, remote. We offer good and stable salary, generous equity and great facilities.<p>We hope to hear from you. Please email us at jobs@aircloak.com if you have any questions!

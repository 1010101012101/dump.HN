7440210,comment,7435720,7436005,1,0,einhverfr,,,"> One of the traditional business strategies built on the GPL, which RMS does not greatly like, but is quite possible to do, is the dual-licensed GPL/proprietary approach. People who are willing to GPL their own software may incorporate your code under the GPL&#x27;s terms. Other people who prefer more traditional commercial terms can, alternately, purchase a commercial license.<p>You can&#x27;t effectively dual license software unless the public license has restrictions that don&#x27;t serve your target market.  The more restrictive the license, the more it favors dual licensing.  This is actually my biggest concern with the GPL.<p>> And in practice, it seems the most common alternative to the AGPL in this setting is to just keep your code fully proprietary, so competitors can&#x27;t build on it.<p>Efficito (of which I am a co-founder) offers hosting for a web-app based on open source software.  We have few specific enhancements that don&#x27;t make it upstream but those are really specific to our hosting offers (i.e. they don&#x27;t provide customer-facing functionality, but provide functionality to us as hosting provider).  Almost all of our work gets contributed back.  The software is licensed under the GPL v2+, and the community is (I think rightly) hostile towards upgrading to the GPL v3.<p>I don&#x27;t like the AGPL.  I think that once you start encumbering services, then you have added a series of restrictions which really are even unheard of in the proprietary software world.  Yes, it is pragmatic, but this is the way real freedom is lost, by insisting that practice serve some notion of freedom rather than the other way around.",1395367143

7440203,comment,7427032,7438957,1,0,s1m0n,,,"Here&#x27;s a link [1] which tests LMDB on a Rackspace server with 16 vCPUs. To make the test fairer to ShardHashFile then the LMDB data file is stored in /dev/shm so that the disk does not get in the way of the test. The test first inserts 70 million keys (tried but failed to insert 100 million keys; how to do that?) using 16 processes (one for each CPU), then it reads the 70 million keys again using the 16 processes, then it updates 2% of the keys while reading the other 98% of the keys again, again using the 16 processes.<p>Read performance without any writing does seem excellent at 6.x million reads per second across the 16 processes. However, insert speed is very slow at only 0.1 million inserts per second. But then LMBD does not claim to be fast at writing. Unfortunately the mix 2% update, 98% read brings the read performance down from 6.x million ops per second to only 0.7 million ops per second. So LMDB seems like an excellent solution if one hardly ever wants to insert.<p>I would also be very happy if anybody can find ways to optimize the test since I could not find a tutorial on programming with the LMDB API. For example, is it necessary to always use a txn when putting and getting? I also couldn&#x27;t figure out how to insert 100 million keys because in order to make the map size big enough then mdb_env_set_mapsize() always complained when giving it super large values. Is this a limitation of LMDB or how else to increase the map size so that 100 million keys (or more) can be mapped? And as a side question: Inserting the keys is so slow: Is there a faster way to initially insert all the keys in order to speed up the performance test?<p>I was also surprised at how big the LMDB data.mdb file gets with 70 million keys & values. The keys & values are 4 byte + 4 byte, so 8 bytes each. However, the data.mdb file ended up as 1.8GB which works out to about 27.6 bytes per key,value pair... which does not seem that good compared to a hash table, or?<p>[1] <a href=""https://gist.github.com/simonhf/9677776"" rel=""nofollow"">https://gist.github.com/simonhf/9677776</a>",1395367023

A fear of TLS --- which is reasonable --- is an insufficient reason to expose yourself to the risks of a custom crypto protocol.<p>You&#x27;ll save yourself time and heartache if you just use SSL. Once every few years, someone will find a flaw in TLS, and once every few times that happens, that flaw will be relevant to your application. But on those rare occasions, you&#x27;ll also have some of the smartest crypto implementors on the planet rushing to come up with the best fix, which is something you will never have with a custom protocol.<p>It is worth remembering here that the overwhelming majority of TLS security issues are relevant primarily to browsers, and rely on the BEAST exploit model, where attackers have extensive and fine-grained control over what plaintexts victims generate, due to Javascript.<p>If certificate processing code scares you --- also reasonable! --- and you&#x27;re building a client/server backend system, do what enterprise software does: slurp the whole certificate into your code, fingerprint it with a hash, and verify it in a whitelist.

What about the people who want to crank out some simplistic, but nifty apps which could drive further use of the iPhone, but they can't build them, because they (for some reason) can't afford a Mac. (But they have lots of available time. I'm thinking unemployed geeks, college students, etcetera)",1221818230
309113,comment,308884,309065,0,0,13ren,,,"There's a long tech history of companies making record profits just before they go out of business.<p>It happens when they hone their product during the adolescence of a disruptive innovation. Microsoft is staring down the twin barrels of linux and SaaS. Its products have pretty much maxed out their potential (read: they've run out of runway), but are neither free nor services. It's a different game. [<i>edit</i> also, wine works amazingly well]<p>Meanwhile, Apple heads the disruptive innovation of iPods. They'll need another disruption soon though. Tech demands it.",1221818227

There may be some more insight in that thread for you.<p>From the responses I got I have decided to continue with my project, infact, I am going to be leaving my job in a few weeks to concentrate on it full time.<p>The world (and the internet) is a vast place, there is more than enough room for healthy competition in most fields. The way I ended up looking at it is that the worst case scenario would be that you don't sell many copies (if your competitors can sell it, so can you), but will have gained so much more experience in trying. Even if it doesnt make it big and just gets a small amount of sales, it is better than nothing. If it under performs and I have to go back to work, any sales that continue to come in will supplement my income.<p>If you enjoy the project you are doing and think you can improve on even just 1 part of your competitors solution its worth sticking with it. You can also watch your competitors and learn how they work, let them do the experimenting for you, see how they are spending their marketing budget etc.",1221816078

I don't know anything about the person that did it or why.  History gets to decide the import of people's actions.<p>I think that increases in behaviors where people work outside social norms (this includes people that strap bombs to their bodies) are indicators of stress in the social fabric.  Labeling actions as stupid, or terrorist, and such are useful but miss the bigger picture sometimes.",1221814812

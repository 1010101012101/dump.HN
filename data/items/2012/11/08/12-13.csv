The eco system is entirely different:<p>- you can use java and therefore java libraries(yes you could do the same in jruby, but nvm)\n- bundles/gems are an order of magnitude better than classical java dependency hell.\n- need something in rails? add a gem. need something in grails? search throw the outdated plugins, search for missing documentation(just take a look at stackoverflow). in general -> write it yourself or pay a consultant to do it.\n- have a question? fight with incomplete documentation.<p>on top of that grails is just a stack on top of the spring mvc.<p>what about play? i like play more than I like grails tbh, because it doesn't want to be the rails of java. yes people compare it to one another, but that's just the familiarity effect.<p>now, where's the computationally intensive stuff? nowhere to be found. it's a web api. where's the computationally intensive stuff in twitter? I don't know, but chances are theres a native extension for that nowadays.<p>There actually was a time when you simply could not build a scalable system in ruby without too many hoops, but that's no longer the case.

4757557,comment,4755470,4756677,2,0,wamatt,,,"The GP's post doesn't feel mean <i>to me</i> personally, it just seems overly subjective and I struggle to find any new conceptual information. However, what is interesting (not a value judgement), is that a visceral and emotional laden post, is voted to the top of HN. I think that says something about the collective emotional state of the current readership.<p>My interest however, is in concepts. One of the most fundamental ones, when providing social commentary, is that people are <i>different</i>, but usually not <i>unique</i>, along a preference axis. The data therefore is <i>clumpy</i>. People fall into clusters of preference, driven by genetic and environmental predispositions.<p>So what is the point of arguing about which clump is better than another? I will keep beating this drum until, people realize the significance, to the point at which it becomes standard in social science studies and general discourse about society.<p>To some, (eg the GP), Dustin's level of optimization meaningless. That's perfectly fine. Furthermore for the GP (and many others), their ultimate meaning is derived from their relationships with other <i>people</i>. That's also ok. Mine doesn't, and there are many others in my cluster too. (albeit smaller numbers). Neither is better.<p>I started a path of minimalist and aesthetic obsessiveness as Dustin describes, since my earliest childhood memories. I was way more extreme in this regard than anyone I knew. I was a very weird kid, and my friends ridiculed my need for the best and my ridiculous research binges (weeks or even months at a time), to satisfy these goals. Even so, I still believe it played a part in making me successful.<p>While those traits still lurk within, I've come to realize over the years through self analysis and introspection, that trying to maximize all things, (especially physical objects), at some point <i>is</i> irrational. Why? Because it becomes more about the pleasure of maximization, than about seeking a bigger goal, if one looks deeply and honestly within. Maximizing for the sake of maximizing. It's very easy to post-rationalize and fall into that trap, if you are type of person with a natural predisposition.<p>So it doesn't matter which way you are approaching the subjective truth about a cluster of preference that works for you. Dustin is growing to appreciate it more, I'm growing to appreciate it less. Others will never appreciate it at all, since they don't find it useful or it's not matched to the way they operate. Others might have different cognitive skills altogether. For example, my best friend can multitask and add large numbers, I can't do either but am good at reading body language and my own internal states. We are both of similar IQ, but have very different intelligences.<p>In case you suspect I'm advocating anyone position is more enlightened, I'm not. I think that's a magic word, and don't want any part of it.<p>For a being that is capable of decision making, there are strategies and outcomes.<p>The most rational goal of any sentience (biological or not), is maximizing the utility function defined by self preservation.<p>Fortunately, it gives me <i>pleasure</i> to think about existence in these terms, and to act in accordance to this self-derived framework for about most of my day (about 2/3's by estimation). I don't advocate it for anyone else, or actually believe I could possibly <i>know</i> what anyone else <i>should</i> do.<p>I suspect this will not resonate with many, simply because my own cluster of preferences, and the combination presented here, may not be representative. That's fine too, I'm like the GP, just being myself.",1352378112

Dual displays took exactly 2 minutes to setup - all driven by GUI. It even has the audacity to offer me separate wallpapers for each display without actually going through any kludges. Depending on which desktop I right-click and choose ""Desktop settings"", it allows me to set background etc. for that display.<p>5. I can choose the sort order and grouping of the applications on the taskbar - I like them unsorted (i.e. the order in which they were launched) and ungrouped (until there are too many and need to be grouped) - all this was configurable in ""Task Manager settings"".<p>6.

It makes sense to buy things that doesn't break down when you are going on a long trip. But the amount of effort Dustin seems to have put in to select them, and advocating others to, doesn't seem to be worth the benefit.<p>Take flatware for example - I think that level of attention to detail for something like that is not called for. How much can you scale it? Minimalist or not, we buy a lot of things in life - how much time can we spend for each and every one of them?<p>The entire post seems to paint the idea that you have to be a connoisseur of everything in life. It is fine if you are an audiophile and spend a lot of time to find the best earphones out there. People have a couple of things in life they care deeply about. But I wouldn't extend that to everything in life as Dustin advocates. Not everybody has the time or means to do that. And even if there is, the cost IMO is just not worth it.",1352376389

There are many scenarios in which data can be accessed read-only such as ACL misconfiguration, poorly secured backups, 0-day attacks which allow stealing cryptographic keys, overly verbose exception messages, etc.<p>An adversary who makes a single copy of your database could impersonate any user, and go unnoticed for potentially a huge period of time unless you have good intrusion protection. A targeted attack might steal just a single token, and could last a few seconds only, but then have unauthorised access indefinitely via the token.<p>EDIT: Incidentally this is why only the <i>hash</i> of the token should be stored in the database, just like storing passwords. Also the token should expire.",1352376323

I recently got an offer for a position in quantitative investment research, in a company that does HFT and algo-trading in general.<p>The pros are that this seems like an interesting job, with very intelligent people which deal with cutting-edge research problems. Also, I've come to understand that in general compensation is better when compared with other tech jobs. Lastly, my programming capabilities are quite weak actually, and I'm happy to have a place that definitely wants me in. I support a family and securing a lucrative job months ahead of graduation is meaningful to me.<p>The major problem I have is the common perception of algo-trading and HFT as ""amoral"", detrimental to the world economy, and so on. I've even got this sense from a few discussions here, though it always seemed like a vague aversion more than a well argued position.<p>I was wondering what do people around here think about this issue?",1352376230

Then you need to determine whether the potential <i>cost savings</i> of switching languages are worth it for you. If things start falling over when you scale, it's an architecture problem, not a language problem.<p>Why do I say that? Because in Twitters case, handling tweets is a ""trivial"" problem to parallelise, and the potential savings of switching language will be a rounding error in terms of scaling their system compared to getting the architecture right.<p>(To scale Twitter: Make trees. Split the following list into suitably wide trees, and your problem has now been reduced to an efficient hierarchical data store + efficiently routing messages.

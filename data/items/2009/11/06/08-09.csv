I don't own a startup, have never done user interface testing and am generally unqualified to talk about how to design these things.<p>However, I'm not bad at statistics and logic, and I'm sorry, but the logic here is pretty bad.<p>The author is comparing a user (edit: really user behavior on a feature/icon that no one gets) to a <i>fair</i> coin.  The conclusion he comes to...?  They are not the same!  Not exactly a lot of insight.<p>A much more fair comparison, in the example given, is comparing the user to a <i>heavily biased</i> coin.  In this case, a coin that (almost) always comes up heads.  With this coin, the convergence is <i>much</i> faster.<p>The (almost) fair coin is a better comparison to a feature that (almost) half of your users do/don't get.<p>So, if you try with 30 users, 14 like something and 16 don't, you need more data!  But, if you try with 30 users, and 29 like it and 1 doesn't, you can stopy.",1257497914

The point of a ""difference table"" is that when you take enough levels of differences (if you like you can think of these as analogous in some way to derivatives, insofar as each step of grabbing differences reduces the order of a polynomial sequence by one power, but it's not really necessary), you eventually get down to a constant, from which you can work backwards to figure out what the patterns in higher-up differences are.",1257497411

925692,comment,925539,925539,0,0,btilly,,,"Penrose contributed a lot and I don't want to minimize that.  However when he stepped outside of his own domain he makes some serious basic mistakes that make him ignorable.<p>As an example in <i>The Emperor's New Mind</i> he makes a number of claims about consequences of Gödel's theorem for human thought that were flat out wrong.  I remember reading criticism of it from a logician in the mid-90s, and Penrose's response.  While I'm no logician, I know enough about it to know that the logician was right and Penrose was wrong.  Human thinking is known to accept inconsistencies and so you can't apply Gödel's theorem to derive any interesting conclusions.<p>When he moves from logic to physics he is even more out of his depth.  Given his verifiable mistakes in logic, I am comfortable in concluding that his startling assertions about physics are far more likely to arise from further mistakes of his than from his having found serious reasons to question the foundations of modern physics.",1257496658

5303833,comment,5303633,5303760,2,0,3pt14159,,,"I like the idea of provably random, but I think I would change it in a subtle way: I would pull the least relevant digits from a list of stocks (or currencies), sum them, then hash them. The key would be to do this after the bets are placed. Since any amount of jitter on the least significant digit for any of the stocks completely changes the outcome, and since there are already <i>massive</i> third parties interested in the exact nature of these numbers, you would have a very random, very provable flip. You wouldn't need a changing seed because the bets would come in and then everyone would wait a second or two and then the result would be provably fair.<p>The problem with your provably random method is that it is still possible for the house to get a slight edge. Since the server seed is random, you could regenerate it hundreds of thousands of times so that the house has a slight edge for the first two or three flips (assuming there are lots of people playing on the same deck, it gets <i>wayyyy</i> easier if it is one deck per person). You don't need that much of an edge to dominate your competition. An edge of 2 or 3% doubles your revenue; which would 4x or 6x your profit, since margins are usually thin for gambling sites.",1362139174

That's why I've tried to show the performance to be gained by letting the DB become integrated with the app. This is a result of the DB having just the right kind of knowledge about the relationships among domain objects to allow it to parallelize business logic.<p>> But if I understand the trade offs here, only a single application can run in-process with the db. Also the db is not protected from crashing when the app crashes.<p>Well, if the application and DB are one, so what? Note that we're only talking about OLTP DBs here. I don't see much of a reason for analytics DBs to be unified with the app. How often do you need more than one app working with the same OLTP data?<p>However, if you absolutely must, there is no reason why the in-process DB shouldn't store its data in shared memory, thus allowing other DB instances to access the information. There are ways to ensure that if one app crashes the memory is left in a consistent state.",1362139123

You don't have to do I all - just enough that it is obvious to ISPs it's a worthwhile map of the country.  Also once ISPs are interested use tracert to get maps of the networks more detail.

As you say the western emperor felt about 400, but the Eastern lasted to 1453. Even not taking the east into consideration, the Papacy was seen as a continuation of the empire, and it was the Pope who crowned Charlemagne emperor about 800AD. Circa one hundred years later, the Holy Roman Empire was formed claiming ""traslatio imperii"" (that is, that there was a legitimate line of succession since the last west emperor), and it lasted until the XIX century.",1362137055

So, you ask the question: ""Could Romans build a computer, if plans were magically given to them?. Then, you have to say, if they had plans they understood, then if they had plans using a certain technology, then if they had zero, and if they had an understanding of x, then y, then z, and on it goes. In then end, it becomes pretty clear the answer is no because of the sheer number of caveats we have to add to make the original premise work.<p>The whole thing seems to be a bit of an idolisation of an ancient civilisation. Its like we want them to have had mystical powers. Like how some people want to connect ancient Egyptians and Mayans to aliens. This is the fantasy of forgotten super knowledge.<p>Or, consider this: do we seriously that we could build something that we designed and built 2000 years from now? Something that could reasonably include or be based on alien technology and knowledge.<p>A connected tangent type thought, and I have no idea where it goes; but how come Romans were so clever, but current tribes around the world, sort of, aren't? How does that work? Is it a resource thing? Environment thing? Seems a bit odd to me that even now we have societies who are actually behind a society 2000 years old.",1362136177

A 50x speed up with optimised routines(memory optimized, branch reduced, using SIMD etc) multiplied by 8 cores gives you a total of 400 times speed up.  This is what I've seen in real life code I've made.  Also, if you offload to some other processor (GPU or dedicated hardware) then of course you can get even faster (again depending on the hardware and problem).<p>So pypy speed ups aren't very good in comparison to the best you can achieve using other techniques... but you can mostly use the same tricks in pypy as you can in CPython to get those results there too :)",1362135922

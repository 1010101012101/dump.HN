75357,comment,75323,75323,0,0,rms,,,"OK, I really don't understand the point. Can you explain to me several different user cases for your site? How many people out there do you think will want to use your sleep.fm?<p>Why does an alarm clock have to be a social networking site? This seems to be a rather utilitarian thing that works perfectly fine via the multiple alarm clocks I already own. All of my friends would use a service like this to mess with me, if I gave them privileges to wake me up. I wouldn't be able to resist the temptation to abuse it if the roles were reversed.",1193982928

75353,comment,75158,75227,0,0,danteembermage,,,"To give another data point, before reading your comment I tried ""50"" plasma"" on Bountii and the best I got was 999 (<a href=""http://www.bountii.com/search.php?item=50%22+plasma&submit.x=33&submit.y=13&sort=price_asc&results=9&min_price=1000&max_price=7000&start=0"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.bountii.com/search.php?item=50%22+plasma&subm...</a>)<p>I did the same search on froogle\n<a href=""http://www.google.com/products?q=50%22+plasma&btnG=Search+Products&scoring=p&price1=700.00&price2=1,000.00&sa=N&lnk=next&start=60"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.google.com/products?q=50%22+plasma&btnG=Searc...</a>\nand found this:\n<a href=""http://www.jepago.com/store/view-item.php?p=834.6&src=F31&sku=PDP5016H-R"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.jepago.com/store/view-item.php?p=834.6&src=F3...</a>\nand thought ""Well, 834 sure beats 999"" I did see the hefty shipping charge but I didn't see the zip code option until you mentioned it. It seems obvious enough once you see it but I think the results are too eye grabbing to get everyone noticing it by accident.<p>Overall I think Bountii had much better results once I got past all the mounts and brackets and stands. Relative to froogle bountii does a much better job of sticking to results that actually matter (froogle had a nice price for a plasma in Yorkshire and for one that didn't turn on). <p>My experience was I clicked on the 1000-7000 filter and got nine clean results and great prices from reliable vendors (at least in the sense that newegg >> jepago?) but i just wasn't sure that i wasn't missing out on a TV at 930 without doing some more less pleasant digging. I did figure out pretty quickly I could do a price highest to lowest search on < 1000 and make sure it was just false positives below but maybe there's a way to make that a little more intuitive.<p>I think it's really important to get the users clear on the shipping taxes thing so here's my proposed solution. On the front page immediately to the left of the search box put a two item checkbox labeled ""with shipping"" and ""without shipping"" with ""without shipping"" pre-checked. Then everyone knows 1. the prices don't include shipping 2. the prices could include shipping if you want. If the user clicks the ""with shipping box"" it expands to be the zip code text box. This way 1 and 2 get done but it still only takes typing+enter to get to the results if you don't want shipping. It avoids asking for the zipcode on the front page which might come off as creepy unless you know what it's for.<p>",1193982681

75350,comment,75310,75310,0,0,mynameishere,,,"For many years, weight lifters thought that by increasing the number of repetitions, they could increase their strength. Eventually, they found out this wasn't true. What's needed is a very few reps and a great amount of weight. The same is likely true with intellectual pursuits. Better to struggle with Bach's inventions 30 minutes a day than to play ""Smoke on the water"" for 10 years.",1193982071
75349,comment,75323,75323,0,0,ryanspahn,,,"Great thank you so much for your feedback.  It's a big help!<p>Here is a full summary...<p>Sleep.FM - The Social Alarm Clock is an alarm clock social network, where upon the alarm time passing on the site(mobile versions soon) you are awakened by your alarm messages(audio files or voice-mail) received from your friends on the network.<p>It is themed around the human conditions of resting and waking where user environments are bedrooms. Users interact with one another by entering each others bedrooms to leave one another gifts(with or without comments), emails and or alarm messages.<p><i></i> The back button issue.. does that happen on the splash page or when you click, ""Already a member?  Click here,"" which takes you to another page?<p>\nThanks!\n",1193981977

I don't want to wake up to getting rickrolled, and I don't want to <i>not</i> get woken up because somebody chose John Cage's 4:33 as my alarm message.",1193981856

But if I did want to sign up, why do you need my website? Which website? My business website? Personal website? Blog? Flickr? The chamber of commerce for my city of residence? (Same goes for ""name"" is this my real name, first name, last name, or a user/nick name?)<p>Why does the input look right justified? That feels awkward. <p>The thick black border around the brown box changes its thickness on the bottom left side.<p>You've got a lot of work to do to get your front page together. I will be interested to see how you progress, and to learn what your site/company is about.",1193981067

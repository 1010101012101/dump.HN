How do you trust the applications that `brew cask` installs?<p>What is preventing `brew cask install firefox` from installing something malicious? When I download an application manually, I trust the site I&#x27;m on by virtue of being there and being savvy enough to know it&#x27;s a legitimate site.

However what it ignores is the price of housing the newly urbanized can afford. Eventually it will have to settle to the economic value they add in the global marketplace.

So that leaves two possibilities<p>1.\tEvery newly urbanized Chinese person moving from the country side will generate the economic potential of a Chicago or London person. So another 200 million investment bankers I suppose.<p>2.\tThe property values of these ghost cities will dramatically deflate to measure up to the economic value added by the newly urbanized. Which means the value of these massive properties needs to written down by the banks.<p>Most people making the urbanization argument assume that option 1 will invariably occur.

After all, you still have to have filler words like &quot;to&quot;, &quot;a&quot;, &quot;the&quot;, &quot;have&quot;, etc - he could be saturating the spots where he can put uniques.<p>So this could substantially underrepresent vocabularies.  There are only so many unique words you can put in a sentence.  As an extreme, if we looked at the first hundred words of every rapper, we would not find a hundred unique words in any of them: (due to repeats of grammatically common words) even though, clearly, all rappers have a vocabulary over a hundred.<p>I wonder if this is a fatal flaw?  How can we estimate where the distortion stops?  (For example, if someone uses 1000 words in their first 35,000, intuitively this seems to imply to me that&#x27;s most of their stock.

7695342,comment,7695180,7695180,1,0,kseistrup,,,"Sooner or later this will break.  I used this method for years.  However, the latest versions of Dropbox (around 2.6.7) screwed the whole thing up: since Dropbox doesn&#x27;t support symlinks, it frequently “thinks” that the permissions of the symlinks is the permissions that the linked-to files should have.  And since symlinks often look like “lrwxrwxrwx” it will chmod the original files 0777, i.e. user, group AND world writable, which is probably not what you want.<p>E.g., I had symlinked my webserver&#x27;s directories into Dropbox, only to find out that all the files had their permissions changed to “-rwxrwxrwx”.<p>Your mileage may vary, but be sure you know what you&#x27;re doing.  Dropbox is unreliable with symlinks.",1399230326

I have been thinking about that and it seems like there are a number of solutions that would allow you to read the text from a photo, vivino.com is an example of an app that does this very well with wine labels. I wonder if you could take a high quality photo of the receipt and the app would add the contents of the receipt to the db based on this? I know its not going to be seamless and may take a bit of manual work at the beginning. Partnering with a grocery store or multiple when the solution picks up traction could also simplify things significantly.",1399230214

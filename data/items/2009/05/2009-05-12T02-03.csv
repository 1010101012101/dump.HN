- The signup screen showed two forms, and showed the error form when I filled and submitted via the top form.
- The slider hid all tweets and wouldn't show them regardless of position of tweets and the category navigation<p>A couple thoughts:
- This may work better as a client versus a stand-alone site.
- It would be nice to know when it starts filtering, and when you are training it. A simple ""Great, now we can help you find more of what you like"" or ""We have filtered your tweets for you"" would be great.",1242097002

It is, at base, little different than all the other sci-fi depictions of housewives in space and Colossal-sized vacuum tube intelligences.<p>It's a common bias to overestimate technological and societal change in the short term, and underestimate them in the long term. Think of those McCarthy-era AI guys promising GAI in a decade: I bet you $100 that their vision for the next 4 decades was surprisingly conservative and unimaginative. The same men who imagined GAI in their lifetimes were most likely the same men who could not imagine the full societal implications of civil rights legislation.<p>I should expect the world in 500 years to be as unimaginable, complex, and alien as the world now is to someone from the 16th century.

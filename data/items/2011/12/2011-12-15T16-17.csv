That already happens now, and if there are no egos but only machines involved Im guessing its even easier.<p>I do agree that manufacturers have to have skin in the game, but that doesnt necessarily have to happen through liability (though thats certainly a possibility). I would imagine that there will, for example, be very tight and thorough certification of any new autonomous car.<p>This is in any way a very interesting topic to think about and I think that all the legal hurdles are very solvable once the technology is solid.<p>(By the way, I only added the remark about the German system because its the only one I know. I was under the impression that there are similar systems in place elsewhere, Im just not sure about that.)",1323968399

I openly declared the amout of each currency on me and they insisted that I give all my USD and CHY.

In fact it's common to make laws against things everybody does simply because it has become a rampant problem.<p>See, the problem is that it is not okay to bring a video camera into a theater, record a movie, and then give it out for free or profit. It doesn't matter if you believe copyright is silly or archaic, it's still law. I hate the laws currently being proposed that basically censor the web but the honest truth is that free distribution of paid content really does hurt the creator. The people who make the things that are worth the time to pirate need to be compensated and if they aren't getting paid then they either stop creating or make doing things the legal way a huge pain in the ass for both pirates and normal users.<p>Remember how you had to activate Windows XP back in the day? That was a huge pain in the ass for people who bought the software legally but was put in place because Microsoft had such a big piracy problem. I think we're actually creating this problem for ourselves and Shifting the blame and responsibility.

I'm not surprised this has happened but we should be asking what is the bigger problem. Is it people pirating and distributing copyrighted materials or is it us, the downloading public, that should be punished for not being able to resist the lure of pirates.<p>I personally feel that if all of us as users realized that we're handing them excuses to censor the web on a silver platter we would quit downloading copyright materials. There is such a fine line between sharing and piracy that it's hard to decide which side any person falls on. Now, a person who records a movie in a theater and puts it online is guilty. No doubt about it. But what about the person who buys a CD, rips it to his computer, then wants to share it with some friends? If he sends a few copies to friends via email or other non public way, is he doing wrong? I'd argue no. But that's what makes this whole thing so scary. On the one hand there's a clear case we are the reason these laws happen. Our inability to resist the lure of free, pirated media. But then we also cannot restrict our right to share our own property with some people.<p>So I'm wondering, when does it stop being sharing and turn into privacy. Never is not the answer. Whether you support or think it shouldn't exist, the fact is that copyright laws have been in effect for a long time. So considering that, where does the line get drawn?",1323966828

Linux can literally be customized at any level and even the most basic components, such as the filesystem or cron scheduler, can be swapped out with alternatives.<p>Generally, the biggest difference between distros is that some come largely pre setup with all necessities taken care of out of the box with an easy install, such as Ubuntu, whereas others allow users to configure their operating system to the smallest detail and only provide the tools to help them do so, such as Gentoo. Generally the latter distros require more savy users and will require them to familiarize themselves with the more mundane differences between distros.<p>I think the most defining characteristic of each distro is usually the package manager or equivalent system. Also, the amount and quality of packages available for distro. Most major distros have their own and each determines a lot about the distro. Debian is known for apt-get for example (which Ubuntu borrowed) which is held in high regard for being relatively easy to use. Gentoo, however, uses portage, which is slow because it usually downloads packages as source and compiles them before installation, but provides a ridiculous amount of flexibility in configuring a system, right down to specifying the compiler flags packaged will use. Both of the these have large repositories of packages for users to browse and select from. Slackware, by contrast, has no package management system to speak of, but does have packages which you can download and install separately.",1323966098

But MS would never force such consequential upgrades on those customers; that's part of why MS owned and still owns the ""enterprise"" market (decreasingly lucrative though it may be).<p>On the other hand, I doubt that consumer adoption driving sites to drop support for IE6 will have any substantial impact on what megacorps decide to deploy.<p>One of the things that really blew my mind this year was a large ($40MM) software development project I became familiar with (a worldwide internal system for a multinational corporation) that concluded -- in 2011 -- and required MSIE 6. MSIE 6! Doesn't even run on MSIE 7, much less any modern browser.<p>While I personally think that's insane -- if you are that specific (not to mention antiquated) with your browser requirements, why don't you just code a native app? -- I've also never developed software with a team larger than five, and certainly don't know the nitty-gritty details about spreading the work over a dozen countries and hundreds of developers, the vast majority being low-cost Chinese and Indian coders. So I'm not judging (or at least I'm trying not to).<p>But my point is that Big Corporate just wants their freaky ""web-based"" apps to run predictably for the projected 6-year deployment timeframe and does not give one flying fuck about whether their staff can access the new hip and way-superior version of <ANY OTHER WEB APP ON EARTH>. Unless said had real business value to large enterprise, but then, if it did... it would probably support MSIE6.<p>So while this news is welcome, it's still unlikely that the computing capabilities of the typical large-company locked-down employee PC are going to become awesome, or even good. Even MSIE8, while way better than 6, still isn't something you jump for joy having to develop for.<p>This matters less and less, though, as the percentage of people who have a way more capable browser in in their pocket increases. So I think that it is starting to make a lot more sense to give up on corporate machines and dead-end legacy browsers, and instead spend that effort on scaling your app's interface to smaller form factors.<p>(Disclaimer: that's what I <i>think</i>, but not what I actually do. I work on web-based software for medium-sized businesses, so I don't have to worry much about what browser users happen to have. In this context, you can have requirements, and I tend to just say, 'In order to decrease development costs, the system requires the Google Chrome browser. But don't worry: it's free, secure, cross-platform, and has become the dominant web technology standard.' That last part is a bit of customer-reassurance hyperbole, but so far, no problems. (And of course the same code typically works fine on Safari if there's an iOS requirement.))",1323965244

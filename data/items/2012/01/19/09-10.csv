Or rather not being a 'passionate' coder is a bad thing?

3483831,comment,3478850,3479127,2,0,kittxkat,,,"> (Fun fact: Availability was what ""drove"" me into piracy in the first place. There was a TV-show which had aired about a year earlier, which I had missed then but wanted to see. I tried every legal way to obtain it that I could think of, because I believed piracy was wrong at the time, but it was simply not for sale. In the end, I ended up with my first torrent downloading.)<p>This is also the very reason that that drove me (and thousands of others too, I'm sure) to piracy and the one reason why I still do it. Even if I really wanted to support that TV show, sometimes it's just not possible (Case in point: The comedy show ""The Class"", it's simply <i></i>nowhere<i></i> available on DVD or similar, yet all episodes are on The Bay. How am I supposed to not torrent that stuff if I wanted to watch it?).",1326967021

But the text doesn't clearly specify how to resolve conflicts between treaties and the Constitution itself. It's a bit of an open question since the U.S. has tended not to enter into treaties that present it square-on, but the Supreme Court seems willing to enforce some restrictions on what exactly a treaty can do. If there's a <i>direct</i> conflict, the Constitution supersedes treaties under <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reid_v._Covert"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reid_v._Covert</a>, but in more gray-area cases the courts seem to give more leeway to treaties than normal laws, due to some vague mixture of the supremacy clause and general principles of deference to / non-interference with the ""political branches"" on foreign policy.",1326966860
3483823,comment,3483549,3483716,14,0,gchpaco,,,"There's been a lot of wink-wink nudge-nudge over the years to the effect that Fujifilm was subsidized by the Japanese government; to what extent this was the favorable tax deals Kodak also got and to what extent it was real was and is hard to assess, but it is certainly the case that Fuji was not burdened by the antitrust pressure that led Kodak to divest itself of its camera-making arm in the middle of the 20th century.  There's a lot of claims to the effect that Fuji piggybacked on the pioneering Kodak research work, and this is very difficult to refute, but if they did they at least equaled Kodak in quality.  When people talk about ""cheaper film"" it was, but not that much cheaper and at least the equal in quality, sometimes better; I found Fuji's consumer films to be far preferable to that turd Kodak called Gold 400.<p>No one in the industry was really prepared for the nose dive film sales took; essentially only die-hards like me still buy it.  Film was and is to some degree still capable of more resolution, more dynamic range, better color fidelity and less prone to weird errors in the way that a Bayer sensor does (almost every Bayer ever sold to consumers had a detail destroying filter attached to it because the alternative is horrific Moire effects), but the speed of editing digital caused it to take off like a rocket.  I suppose the lesson to be learned there is that Kodak spent a century making the very best film it possibly could (for the professional lines, anyway) when it turns out the market is perfectly happy with a 4 MP digital with a mediocre lens and chromatic abberation out the arse if it cuts the feedback loop down from days to seconds.<p>I have mixed feelings about Kodak in general--they had a tendency to make bizarre decisions that led the few film enthusiasts remaining to believe that it was simply a matter of time before everything got the shaft and they would have to switch to something else anyway.  They also made a lot of really bad digital cameras, which was strange considering the superb reputation their press lenses and the Retina had back in the day.  Fujifilm never divested itself of its cameramaking arm and continues to make some of the best lenses in the business to this day, and I think that has been a very important strength for them.",1326966847

In much the same vein as the ""marriage is only between a man and woman"" variety.<p>The English verb ""to steal"" is certainly capable of meaning ""to take without the right"" regardless of whether physical property is involved.  Not to mention the myriad of common idioms, like ""So-and-so stole my idea.""  What else are people trying to express by its use in this case?<p>It's clear that the issue here is their legal right to exclusive distribution and transmission (or ""state granted monopoly"", if you prefer) of their work, not whether or not they ""still have a copy"".  It can be disagreed with, but they have it and others distributing their work without permission diminishes it.<p>Not saying I disagree with you that it's the wrong way to go about things, but, I think if one is being honest, the argument over the use of word is telling on both sides and that some people are clearly trying to demonize those who use the word, in the same way that they feel they are being demonized by its use against them.",1326966336

In fact, if they can make about 1/3 to 1/2 of their salary <i>without</i> having to work at a job, that's already considered a victory, although of course people don't stop there.<p>And that's kind of the point... once you've built a business that successfully and reliably provides 1/2 your previous salary without working for someone else (i.e. building a product or productised service, not a plain service/freelancing), you can probably increase that to 1x, 2x, etc... whereas before, there's a hard glass ceiling above you.<p>Obviously that equation is less appealing if you're already well off financially - hence your distate of the business idea you came up with.<p>Which is fine - one of my friends who applies this method has in fact done exactly the same thing - built a small business, figured out how it would be profitable, then decided that it wasn't the kind of business he cared about building, and so shut it down and looked at another idea.<p>Product-market fit and idea-founder fit are equally important - at least when you have the room/comfort to make those decisions!",1326966252

The mind is much more than <i>symoblic processsing</i>:  it attaches meaning to information, creates relations between itself and the world, (amongst many other things). These phenomena are not information processes and cannot be achieved by Linear Regression (to characterize Machine Learning accurately enough).<p>It is important to point out that any scientific explanation of consciousness is going to be unsatisfyingly reductionistic. Science significantly reduces experience to a ""substance model"" where everything can be modeled as substances in motion ... and thus the mathematical edifice which results is completely devoid of the vast majority of information which one acquires: the sound of the cannonball as it his the grass, its colour, significance, etc.<p>The vast majority of our experience which we may hope to explain is discounted (necessarily so) in order to be scientific (predict what our next experiences will be like).<p>There will be an increasing number of ""explanations"" of various aspects of mental functioning based on the structure of the brain, I doubt any of these will provide anything more compelling than what we have currently.<p>There are ""brute certainties"" (brute facts) which are undoubtable and <i>the starting point</i> for <i>all</i> investigation, scientific or otherwise. This brute fact is experience, or more accurately, the world of signficance, relations, awareness, etc. in which the self as well as everything else is embeded within.<p>Explanation proceeds as generalization, taking one aspect of Experience and generalizing to some general property of Experience: pens fall, all objects fall, all objects in gravitational fields fall.<p>There is nothing we can appeal to in accounting for Experience itself: there is nothing else available. Explanation has to end somewhere, and that is the final - and only tenable - reply to the question of our conscious experience.",1326966071

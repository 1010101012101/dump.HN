First, the price has to be a good value.  I don't want to pay a lot for something that will last a short time.  I wear cloths until i can't.  Second, there has to be at least one employee there that is willing to help me find something.  I can't pick cloths out, I need a guy/girl willing to say ""this is not a good shirt for you"".  and the 3rd is the universal, the cloths need to be close to my style, which I would describe as business casual.  I'm probably going to start with the essential, but i might sample the ""luxury"" level first.  If it proves fruitful, perhaps i'll stay with it.",1360771162

5213691,comment,5213020,5213458,3,0,jerf,,,"No, I stand by my original point. For modest savings in energy costs, generally eaten up by greater up-front purchase costs anyhow, you have real range issues, issues with cold, issues with having to worry about accessory usage, and difficulty in rapidly refilling the energy tank.<p>You imply in another of your replies that you appear to think it requires a 200 mile commute to have to worry about a 200 mile range. But that's not true. I live in Michigan. I have about a 30 mile commute, mostly highway. (Comments about how I should avoid that may be forwarded to /dev/null. I have my reasons and I've made my choice.) Tesla claims a 265 mile range. No problem, right? Well... dock some miles for that being a best-case marketing number, where I live in the real world. I need a round-trip, and can't count on being able to plug-in during the day. (Yes, that's easy <i>now</i> while plug-in stations are basically a gimmick. If electric cars take off, those stations will go poof. As it is they're nearly full up, and you know, one station is basically one car-day, not like a gas pump that serves dozens of cars per day.) Dock a significant percentage of the miles for the fact that yes, some days I have to go to work in 5 degree F weather. Dock some more miles for that fact that sometimes, not often, but often enough to plan on, my highway journey gets stuck for an hour in the aforementioned 5 degree weather, and I <i>need</i> to run the heater (or sometimes the AC on the other side). I'm forgetful, and I'd like to be able to go a <i>day</i> without plugging my car back in.<p>Suddenly the ""265 mile"" range doesn't seem so great anymore. It's at most barely adequate, with serious concerns of running out of juice on the highway at least once a year. By comparison, my average daily commute runs about a gallon and a half of gas. An electric car costs me much more than a non-electric and has a pay-back window in the multiple decades, <i>ignoring</i> battery replacement costs. No sale.<p>Of course, in an advocacy context it's easy to poo-poo all those concerns, or claim I'm overreacting. (For instance, ""Be less forgetful."" Yes, thank you, I've <i>tried</i> that. It works better to face the truth than try to simply deny it.) It won't matter, though, because I don't drive in an advocacy context, I drive in the real world, where ""I get stuck in 5 degree weather"" is not merely an abstract internet argument, but something that could be a real problem for me. Whereupon I will somehow stumble onto the local recharging station, only to discover that I'm 90th in line behind all the other people having the same problem because it simply isn't possible to recharge people as quickly as they can pump gas.<p>Put another order of magnitude on the battery efficiency, just for the sake of argument, and there's no problem anymore. Put a factor of 4 on there and I'm probably comfortable enough to consider it, though I'd still like a payback window of less than decades. As much as you might like to collapse my point to this, I'm not <i>against</i> electric cars, I would actually love to drive one that lived up to the hype. But as it stands <i>right now</i>, electric cars are just <i>adequate</i> for some of the less demanding use cases, and that's something that needs to be dealt with honestly, not by browbeating people into trying to pretend otherwise. It won't work; electric cars have to work in the real world, not people's heads.",1360771087

This is well beyond getting you to your office of course, but 160 miles is well within reach for many busy suburban people (read: kids).<p>This and the fact that apparently there's substantial power loss if you leave it overnight without plugging it in (say, you're staying at a hotel on a trip), and the dramatic range loss in cold weather (which much of the US is subject to), and you've got a vehicle that doesn't give people the level of reliability/confidence they want.<p>Not to mention, the car is more than just what gets you from home to work - much of the US lives in extremely large metro areas, particularly in the northeast where the NYT reporter was based. I have <i>many</i> coworkers here who drive hundreds of miles to see family on weekends, for holidays, etc. You have family scattered all the way across the northeast from Boston to NYC to DC to PA, and beyond.

Because I was speaking of active one - as in, you directly exchange your time for money.<p>Can't comment on your plan wrt template selling, but it seems you might start earning money faster if you get right to freelancing; though it's up to you, of course.<p>Speaking of timeline - in my opinion, it might be more optimal to target real-life tasks and not some deadlines: that is, instead of saying ""I'll spend 3 months learning JS and then will start creating templates"" you might just do the tutorial, maybe make a couple small projects to get comfortable a bit. Then pick some task - like a template, or just browse freelance sites, pick a job you like and use it as a target - start doing it and then see whether your skills are up to it or not. If not, learn more until you get there.<p>And speaking of money - from what I saw on elance, $10/hr is about minimum for Python/JS, that'll get you people who can barely speak English. Around $15 is not impossible for a person with a bit of experience, and from then on... well, that's a whole different story here, about marketing, client network, connections, self-promotion etc etc. Though, again, for the first couple of jobs there your main goal should be not getting high rates, but actually winning these jobs and creating some reputation.<p>So to sum it up - why exclude yourself from development freelancing for 6+ months?

After watching several characters get killed in the span of thirty seconds, keep in mind we had never really seen this before, they then top it off with killing one of the most beloved characters in the series.<p>I was a kid at the time. I was shocked. I cried. About a fictional cartoon robot. I didn't feel that way again until that jerk Whedon killed Wash.<p>The result was that since the reaction to all this was rather severe, kids were devastated, that they actually changed the storyline in the GI Joe animated movie they were producing at the time. Duke was supposed to be killed in that movie but changed it so that he actually survived instead. Of course, they show that he survived by just adding in a background voice at the end of the movie saying that Duke was going to be okay! If you watch the scene where he is injured, with the idea he wasn't supposed to survive, you can tell by the way the scene was animated that he clearly dies right then and there.<p>On a side note, most of the time none of the GI Joes would be killed in the comic book, just faceless Cobra soldiers. But I remember one comic where a few of the Cobra soldiers commit mass murder by shooting up several of the Joes that were being held prisoner in a pit.

The issue here is that there has always been a problem.  Academic output should always have been available to anyone who wanted it _at a fair price_.  Until electronic documents became so ubiquitous you could tollerate the constraints of publisher ownership because they helped overcome real problems of communication and physical distribution.  The question is haven't we now reached the point where these problems have gone away?",1360767843

Google and machine learning brings a whole new capability of interpreting unstructured, seemingly unrelated data, that may consist of a lot of noise, but also contains insights that were otherwise impossible to get through the traditional research and data collecting process.",1360767724

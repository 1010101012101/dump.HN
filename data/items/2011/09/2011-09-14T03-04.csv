2994836,comment,2993181,2993538,1,0,ChrisNorstrom,,,"Oh my Science yes! That's why I quit Digg long ago and same with Reddit. That ""democratic"" free-for-all shit got old real quick. I won't hide it, Digg and Reddit upset me because my content never got upvoted or paid attention to.<p>I submitted a link on a article about a ""morning after"" pill for Aids that actually works and is already available, it's been available for a long time, if you have been exposed to the aids virus you can take it within 24-48 hours and it won't allow the virus to attach to your cells or something like that, it was created for people working in sanitation, in case they get pricked. It's pretty toxic but it works. It was called the Aids prevention pill you've never heard of.<p>NO ONE cared. Not on Reddit, not on Digg. And when I compared it to the articles that did make the front page it seemed like my contribution would be just what Digg/Reddit wanted.<p>With Reddit, I hated how good stories get overlooked yet kittens and pictures of ""my girlfriend made this for me"" and ""nailed it"" and ""found kittens what should I do"", ""here's a picture my autistic nephew made"" and all that other shit makes it.<p>I looked at what Reddit wanted and I submitted appropriate content. My submitions were ignored, yet other people's submitions of the same category and quality were upvoted. Wtf?<p>With Digg, the problem was if you weren't part of some circle of elite friends, or didn't submit your article at the right time of the day it didn't get upvoted. Again, it's shit like this that really drove me away. Reddit just pissed me off by going from a 'sacredly intellectual' site to '4chan for educated people', complete with kittens and politics and memes in a year or two.<p>Hacker news, although I've heard it has changed, seems to have avoided the lobotomy. 2 out of 2 of my submitions made it to the front page. It worked the way I expected it to work. Hacker news is a place for startup news, tech news, entrepreneurship, show and tell. So I submitted content that matched and it got upvoted to the front page. I feel like I contributed and helped the community, and I don't feel abandoned or pushed away like I did with Reddit.<p>My only annoyance with Hacker News is how it works. I'll visit the home page and see some amazingly interesting links, 4 hours later I'll refresh the page and many of those links are gone, 1 or 2 of them have moved back 2-4 pages... wtf? So if I'm not on 24/7 I'll miss out on content?<p>So that's how I feel about social news sites. I'm either confused as to how they work or annoyed by the communities that make them up.<p>I personally want something more static. I know constant incoming news is great for traffic but it's terrible for our productivity and brains. I'd like to try out a site that updates once a day at midnight or twice a day at most instead of constantly updating. And the community votes on what links will be posted tomorrow, once that list of links is finalized, they are posted, and they don't change order or dissapear. Each Page on the site, is exactly one day, if I click 2 pages back then I'm going exactly 2 days back, that way I can keep track of all the links I've gone through easily. That's what I'd like to see, I'm not sure if it would work out as well as I theorize it would, but it would be a nice experiment.",1315972785

If you really get big in the US, you can try to go to other markets and you could name the company a chinese name and market it in china as a separate division.  Most likely more would need to be changed than the name.<p>Look at the way Netflix has grown for example.

Please don't take this the wrong way, but intermittent chronic diseases (such as auto-immune disorders like Crohn's and U.C.) might as well be designed to take advantage of the broadly recognized weaknesses of the human mind:<p><pre><code>    - the perception of pattern where none exists
    - a preference for causal narratives involving benevolent and malevolent agents
    - a preference for simple certainty over complex uncertainty
    - broadly, a sense that you are in control
</code></pre>
I am not saying anything about the two of you as individuals or as patients, or about the content of your posts here. But the standard of evidence and reasoning that I have encountered elsewhere trying to get a grasp on U.C. is ... not high.

2994750,comment,2993650,2994657,3,0,steve8918,,,"I probably wasn't clear with my original statement.  I said the stock market used to be a ""predictive market of future earnings"".  What I meant more precisely was that the stock market used to be a market where people would make prediction about future earnings about companies.  If you thought a company was doing well, you would buy and hold it, a la Warren Buffett.  Some people traded order flow and other things, but the vast majority traded it as if it was a proxy for future earnings growth.<p>Over the years, that has changed.  Once the internet hit and day traders became more common, it became more and more about buying stocks that will go up and selling stocks that will go down.  I think people forget that even during the 90s, commissions for buying and selling stock were in the hundreds of dollars, not $8.95 like today.  It was expensive for retail investors to buy and sell stock.<p>The time period for holding stocks has decreased sharply since then, where a few years ago rebate traders would buy and sell stock to just get the rebate from the exchanges, and now to where HFT eat the lunch of those same manual rebate traders.<p>The vast majority of trading done on the markets today is not done based on the quality of the company or the quality of the earnings, but based on how the stock will trade.  Sure, there's still institutional trading, and I'm sure plenty of quant models make use of things like earnings growth, etc.  And yes, things like news and fundamentals do cause prices to go up and down.  But the <i>vast majority</i> of daily trading, 75% of volume, is done by trading entities that don't care about fundamentals, and only care about miniscule movements in the stock price.  This is why I use volume as evidence, because it demonstrates that most trading done isn't done because of the predictive nature of the stock market for future earnings, but because of the extremely short term predictive nature of the stock price itself.<p>That's why I said that it's less about predicting future earnings grow and more about making nickels every 10 ms.  C trading 500MM shares a day is like people rolling dice every millisecond in the alley way and exchanging money upon every roll.  The other example that I was searching for but couldn't recall was when GM went bankrupt and the stock was still trading over $1.  This was purely trading activity even though the ""future earnings"" of the stock was 0.<p>It's become a casino where probability theory dominate and less about ""I drink Coke so I should buy KO"".<p>BTW, I'm not saying this is good or bad.  I just believe this is how the markets are.  The same thing happened when daytraders entered the markets during the dotcom boom.  I do believe gaming the system, trying to ""break"" the markets with quote stuffing, etc, is wrong, but fundamentally I believe that the nature of the markets have changed, and anyone who wants to get involved in it should understand the nature of the change.  Anyone who thinks that they should keep their money in mutual funds and let the mutual fund companies sip 2-5% every year for doing worse than the markets, and then also exposing yourself to market crashes every 7-10 years, I believe, are fools.",1315970517

Without suffering from not having version control, no one will care.  Now, I'm not saying that we should only focus on what people think they need as students, but if there is a way to force them to understand the value of something, all the better.",1259571591

It gets me every time and is a big reason why I wouldn't purchase a Droid, as pathetic as that reason may be.",1259571281

It can be traded and bartered for with other scientists to gain access to grants, co-author status, experiments, different data and a host of other favours.  Simply giving it away can put you in a real financial or academic disadvantage.",1259570513

It's not ideal, but for code you can't monetize, open sourcing it is a fine idea.",1259570422
967541,comment,966716,966802,0,0,ewjordan,,,"<i>Automated trading by itself is of course feasible for almost anyone determined enough.</i><p>...as well as a healthy bankroll to start with.  If you can't maintain at least $25,000 in your trading account, you can't day-trade anything but currencies, so you can't really bootstrap from nothing.  And if you don't have a <i>lot</i> more money than that to play with, you're never going to make enough to replace a salary.  Even if you're actually able to beat the market.<p>Which brings me to: don't underestimate the market.  That doesn't mean it's efficient, but it's very difficult to beat it by a large margin or without considerable risk.  A 51/49 edge can be very good if you can get enough trades that offer those odds (forgive my putting it in those terms, I know it's not completely accurate), but that's still going to mean that you can have huge swings either way, even over a large number of trades.<p>And please, please, PLEASE don't assume that because something worked on historical data it will necessarily work in the live market.  There are so many ways to arrive at faulty conclusions here, not the least of which is bad data or analysis (no, your vanilla backprop network is not predicting daily S&P 500 returns, even if it looks like it when you compare it to the training data...), so even if you've got a rock solid strategy that you're sure will continue to work, make sure you could actually make the trades before you get too excited.  Don't assume highs, lows, or opens mean anything, pretty much ever, because weird trades that you couldn't have made sometimes show up in those.  If you can, deal with bid/ask data (tick by tick, ideally) instead, and make sure the things you want to trade are actually there long enough to get them given your latency.<p>Needless to say, use a decent broker that charges low fees and lets you have programmatic access to their trading platform.  Most fail on both counts, so beware.",1259570229

Blackberry gets it, Apple gets it, Microsoft didn't get it until too late.<p>Seriously, how we use phones hasn't change much in a hundred years. The damn thing should be bulletproof at this point. In a smartphone the dialer should be absolutely simple and absolutely work 100%. And the markets don't think like you or I do. They'll put up with something for so long, but if your competitor gets it and you don't you become branded as a failure. It's very hard to recover from that. Ask GM.",1259569302

Harder in this sense would just refer to the work required to iterate until it becomes good.<p>So all ideas you just ""come up"" with will all effectively be of uncertain value.",1259569176

The likely results from his offensive tactics is hatred and opposition against science and more religious fanatics - simply because most people are religious and attacking their beliefs won't make them less religious.<p>And really, even if he breaks religion and removes it, then we will still have skin colors, nationalities and different cultures - - things that will still split people up in tribes and things that will still cause wars.

I have only had to force quit a couple of times, and usually when I was exiting the app anyways.  My only complaint is the keyboard and sometimes the phone comes out of sleep (setting a lock pattern prevents this) and dials people that I didn't want them to.  Other than that, the phone has been great.  Fast as I would expect, and plenty of apps to keep me busy.",1259568813

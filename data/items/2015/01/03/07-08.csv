8830209,comment,8830040,8830040,0,0,jrapdx3,,,"Interestingly, the article points to &quot;medical marijuana&quot; as the big hurdle to overcome if regulation of recreational cannabis use can succeed.  Naturally it leads to questions about exactly what ailments is marijuana known to be a remedy for?<p>A quick review of the cannabis literature shows potential therapeutic utility for cannabis-derived compounds, particularly in conditions like depression, psychosis and anxiety. So far, it&#x27;s all &quot;promising&quot; and no conclusions have emerged.<p>IOW, definite indications are not established.  Risks of adverse effects are not delineated but must be known in order to prescribe responsibly.  In addition, lack of product standardization makes safe use murky.<p>Living here in Oregon where medical marijuana has been available for a long time, the therapeutic boundaries appear practically nonexistent.  It means with very little effort just about anyone can get the &quot;card&quot;.  Indeed, most users need not bother since it&#x27;s easily available and laws are seldom enforced.<p>Of course, &quot;decriminalization&quot; was the reason the recent Oregon ballot measure passed with a wide majority. A good idea, but it calls into question the merit of enshrining cannabis as a &quot;drug&quot; when its credentials as a therapeutic agent are still in doubt.<p>I&#x27;d advocate phasing out &quot;medical marijuana&quot;, and those who believe it is effective can easily purchase it from licensed outlets, just like any other user.  That&#x27;s not different than many drugs sold without prescription, like analgesics, gastric acid-reducers, etc.<p>BTW, many OTC drugs are not particularly cheap, but because they are OTC insurance won&#x27;t cover the costs.  Exactly parallel to buying marijuana retail even if some people might argue it&#x27;s for a medicinal use.",1420271780

I had considered including crlibm too during my work but decided against it because it would be a lot more work.<p>Also, crlibm functions are provably correctly rounded only for univariate transcendentals (thanks to the worst case paper I cited in the blog).  There is no such proof available for bivariate functions, which is why computing at an arbitrary very large precision (the way glibc does) is the only way to increase the likelihood of correctly rounded results.  IIRC crlibm does not even try for bivariates.<p>I believe some documentation on the crlibm website cites benchmark numbers where IIRC glibc performs better (although not by much) in the fast paths of most functions they mention but gets hit really badly in the slow path.  Slow path inputs are usually quite rare, but if your application/benchmark hits them regularly enough (especially sice the slow path is a factor of 1000 times worse) then you&#x27;ll obviously conclude that the performance sucks and that crlibm is better.",1420270368

Just consider my favorite &#x27;love to hate&#x27; Emacs Lisp example: <a href=""http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/DestructiveOperations"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/DestructiveOperations</a> Check out the bit where using &#x27;sort&#x27; incorrectly can self-modify the function. Anyhow, maybe Clojure is &quot;just&quot; another LISP, perhaps, but it is really nice due to many small improvements making a big difference.",1420269084

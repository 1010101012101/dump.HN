The Roman empire wasn&#x27;t exactly the friendliest place to live if you were an outsider. Therefore a big part of the belief system is the value of the individual. IIRC, Christianity was one of the first belief systems to suggest that all people _were_ actually people: up until then, &quot;people&quot; was just part of whichever clan you were in. Other folks were sub-human.<p>So the real question in regards to both abortion and embryo hacking is how much value we place on other humans -- humans of a different color, humans that are babies, humans that disagree with us. Do we treat them as we would want to be treated? Or are they basically disposable?<p>I&#x27;m not a religious person, and the theology gets very complicated, but it&#x27;s not simply a matter of &quot;religion says this must be bad, so I will reject all science and progress!&quot; Folks on both sides of this discussion tend to over-simplify the positions of the others. Didn&#x27;t believe you were doing that, but I felt the discussion could use a little more clarification.",1429783133

Overtime that maturity meant changes going out were mostly feature based and we could afford to lag those things out. You&#x27;re right though, certain things require rebuilding everything but we try to approach that pragmatically. On the platform team we&#x27;d have ownership of say 20-30 services so over a period of a week we can push those through a staging and load test environment then to production. We have 4 or 5 other teams that do the same. There are tools to ensure we can keep track of which libraries are in production and if anything is out dated.<p>Like I mentioned before. There are definitely tradeoffs to microservices and they don&#x27;t make sense for every use case but  if you look at the companies that adopted this architecture pattern you&#x27;ll see the common journey they all went on.

Answer for me is .. it can&#x27;t.</i><p>I can&#x27;t tell you how, but I can tell you that they do. A friend of mine went to the psychiatrist with a case of social anxiety and after the second or third drug they tried, the problem disappeared. Poof. Like that. With all the somatic effects he had.<p>So whatever he got in the end, eventually worked. But this is how it works with psychiatric mediation - people have a lot of different responses to drugs and doctors can&#x27;t predict them in advance, so initially the therapy is mostly matching drug to patient.",1429780096

The reason we are talking about border controls is because yes most come from Mexico. The typical person who is here illegally is Mexican, over 60% are from Mexico. <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illegal_immigration_to_the_United_States#Present-day_countries_of_origin"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illegal_immigration_to_the_Unit...</a> Add in central America and around 75% of people coming illegally are from southern border. \nI can understand their motivation. What I can&#x27;t stand is trying to present BS.<p>When they author is trying to obscure facts one must wonder what other stats he is omitting or only half presenting.<p>As for taxes. Yes taxes suck. They also fund a ton of things that make American #1 in many areas. Should Americans abroad pay as much as American at home, of course not. But they clearly should still pay. You have a great passport and can come back to a country that has a wealth of opportunities that are not available in most other places and in some cases no where else. Why should you get to pay nothing while the rest of Americans maintain the great country for you to come back when you please? Maybe we should make it cheaper for people to renounce their citizenship, they are not needed.<p>Note: I should have made two post splitting comment on the immigration stats and taxes in to two posts to see the up/down vote difference based on the issues.",1429779955

Arguably there should be some doubt about whether your research will lead to something important else you can&#x27;t be doing anything novel. There is nonsense in <i>any</i> endeavour and that is why there are layers of ethics committees, reviews and audits within animal research that limits wanton nonsense. The price of any endeavour is that there will be waste — humans cannot help it — it is unfortunate that the waste is at the expense of animal life.<p>The first article you link to is about the abuse of frequentist statistics, it is not a piece of nonsense primary research (1182327). The article is correct and an interesting read, but not in support of poor use of animal experiments. The second article (8124111) is about clinical research, not pre-clinical animal research although the arguments raised in the article are applicable to pre-clinical research. It is very difficult to find and expose nonsense research!",1429779915

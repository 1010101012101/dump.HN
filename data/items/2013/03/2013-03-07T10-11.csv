Anything that is slightly inconvenient for one specific workflow is a ""misfeature"", ignoring entirely that many people like it that way. A site designer cannot please everyone.<p>Most non-hackers do not even notice this stuff. Go find a normal person and ask them to list the sites they visit and whether or not they auto-focus the search box. They do not notice. We are the weird ones.<p>If it annoys you, change it. You have the power. Most of the time what you want can be accomplished with a simple extension, <i>no coding required</i>.<p>If not, you can write your own extension, or write a script for an extension, or ""use"" browsers like uzbl and luakit, or write your own browser. Then you can put your solution on the web, so other people can benefit.",1362653947

I believe it actually encompasses a vast majority of people who are currently earning the minimum wage. Note that I'm willing to change my beliefs if my reasoning has led me astray :)<p>The key assumption you've made that I disagree with is this: ""why would the worker keep working for that employer for $X/hour in the first place?"". It seems to me that this assumption boils down to an underlying assumption that the labor market is an efficient market.<p>In another comment elsewhere in this thread sergiosgc makes a statement that I think is relevant here: ""You wrongly assume the job market is a perfect market. It's not; there are barriers to entry, barriers to exit and lots of asymmetric negotiation positions.""<p>My argument (and I Am Not An Economist) is that the COST of labor and the VALUE of labor (from the employer's perspective) are not necessarily equal.<p>A quick hyperbolic example of a labor-rich job market that demonstrates this difference:
* Your labor market has 1,000,000 people
* You are offering the only job in the labor market. For every hour the lone employee works the job will generate $500 of additional revenue for your company.
* There is no minimum wage, and your goal is to minimize your costs while maximizing your revenue.<p>What is the price you pay your employees under these conditions? It's not $500/hour. It's probably only room and board.
If we introduce a minimum-wage of $5/hour, what is the price you pay now?
If we raise the minimum-wage to $10/hour, what is the price you pay now?
If we raise the minimum-wage to $100/hour?
$1,000/hour?<p>I admit that this was an extraordinarily hyperbolic example, but I think the current U.S. job market is a less-extreme example of this.<p>1) Based on anecdotal evidence (that I'm too lazy to look up current estimates of the number of people not participating in the U.S. workforce), the current job market around the country currently favors employers. Many people are fervently searching for jobs which drives down the PRICE of labor. This doesn't change the VALUE of any particular job for the employer.<p>2) The median U.S. income is down over the last several years (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Household_income_in_the_United_States"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Household_income_in_the_United_...</a>), while U.S. corporate profits are hitting record highs (<a href=""https://www.bea.gov/newsreleases/national/gdp/gdpnewsrelease.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.bea.gov/newsreleases/national/gdp/gdpnewsrelease...</a>).

</code></pre>
I am not sure you ""know"" javascript. If you are saying that there is an Angular version of javascript then you are terribly mistaken. Angular is probably one of the only mainstream framework that stays true to javascript. All other frameworks ( Backbone, Ember etc.. ) are the ones that actually mould javascript into an OOP language. I would say that Angular uses the prototype chain ( you know javascript is a prototypical language right? )  the best. The whole scope object inherits prototypicaly while in all other frameworks we create an illusion of OOP. Someone correct me if I am wrong here.<p>Just for clarity, I believe that when you write Angular code you are writing the purest form of javascript. Because thats what you are writing there. Just plain javascript. There is no constructs imposed by the framework at all. This is probably why most people think ""Angular's javascript"" is not javascript. They have been always fed layers on top of javascript because ""javascript is somehow not optimal, not right"" and it has to be ""changed"" and ""corrected"" . OOP is shoved down the throat. This is probably gone on to the extent that when someone actually writes in pure javascript it starts looking like a foreign language !!",1362651249

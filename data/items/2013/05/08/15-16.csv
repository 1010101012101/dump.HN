The Googlers next door use Russian materials from Moscow, also not written in English.<p>It's hard to do better than Singaporean materials, which are in English and modified (not in a bad way) for the US market, which you can find at SingaporeMath.com. Their Primary Mathematics series is superb. I use the Standards Edition, which is said to track the California State Math Standards. That sounds ominous, but actually the state standards are excellent. The districts essentially ignore them by using a ridiculous ""reform"" curriculum that, being ""a mile wide and an inch deep,"" will always include a checkmark every year for any topic you can think of, thereby covering anything mentioned in the state standards (superficially and in random order).<p>Note that for these Asian curricula, you REALLY need to know how to teach the math. The textbooks only provide visual aids and example problems, not the tutorial text (paragraphs of explanation) typical in US books. If you go for Singapore Math, you should get the Home Instructors Guide (at least for a few levels), which teaches you how to teach it.<p>And DON'T start a kid at too high a level.

5674929,comment,5673544,5674395,7,0,beatgammit,,,"When you're targeting Linux, it's easier in the long-run to just use Linux. The base system isn't the same between the two because Mac OS X uses BSD versions of important things like SED, grep, etc. There are subtle differences that most Mac OS X users I've met don't know and can lead to weird problems like ""why doesn't X work; it works fine on my mac!!"".<p>If everyone's on Linux, the dev and productions systems are more similar, so less scripting issues can arise. I personally use Arch, other coworkers use Mint or Ubuntu, and only one developer uses Mac OS X (others switched because of above problems; he couldn't switch because of EFI problems). Even devs new to Linux (from Windows) love Mint, and all is well and good in the world. Servers run Debian or Ubuntu, so I test my changes in a VM because Arch has noticeably newer software in the repos, but that's because I can't stand Debian as a desktop system (package manager too slow).<p>Also, the Mac OS X user uses his Mac like a Linux box. He only ever touches his trackpad to use non-keyboard friendly apps (uses Vimium for Chromium, tmux/vim for terminal/editing, etc). Our devs not familiar with the keyboard generally use Sublime on Linux, which is a fantastic editor as GUI editors go.<p>The trackpad drivers aren't that bad, but may require some configuration in the xorg conf (I got multitouch working, but disabled it because I find it annoying).<p>We don't standardize on a single dev platform because each developer is different. The developer understands that using Linux is going to be easier in the long-run, but he/she must understand that his/her choice of OS must not negatively impact productivity. We've had a few developers try starting on Windows, but we'd refuse to support any dev environment besides Ubuntu Linux, and when they ran into problems, they switched to Mint/Ubuntu.<p>I've never seen a developer be more productive on Mac OS X than Linux. In fact, those gesture usually end up slowing him/her down from what should be easy using the keyboard (and all that switching from trackpad to keyboard is <i>not</i> productive).",1368028555

No matter how good or bad his points, that behavior is discouraged.<p>On whether I am too emotionally invested, if my points had been imbued with excessive emotion, that would have been one thing.  But they were not.  My big point was, ""This potentially addresses a real problem in trying to reach abused children, and we should collect data on whether it actually works.""  I believe that to be a fairly neutral point.<p>Once we have data, we can revisit this with information of the form, ""We had 5 complaints and 2 children called our hotline because of a sign that was seen fairly regularly by an estimated 1000 children.""  At that point we can try to find a balance between people who had a mildly unpleasant conversation with their children, and children who no longer have absolutely horrible things happening to them.<p>But until we have that data, we can't productively have those conversations.  Clearly abuse is orders of magnitude worse than being confronted with an unpleasant and possibly confusing sign.  Clearly more normal children are going to be confronting that sign than are going to see abuse stopped.  How do these opposing interest balance?  Nobody can tell because we don't know what portion of people who see the sign are disturbed by it, and we don't know how many abused children will actually respond to it.<p>So we should run the experiment and collect data.",1368027282

There was a bug in the DB cache used by our security service (I think caused by a broken clone() implementation that shallow-copied when it should have deep-copied, but this was a while ago now) that meant that if permissions for two different clients were requested in quick succession, both would end up with the intersection of their permissions - which were then cached in the main application (I guess there must have been some logic like the API always triggered a refetch to ensure it returned the canonical value, whereas for the rest of the application performance was more important?). In theory it could've been happening already, but I guess we never had two clients loading the same webpage close enough to the same time (and they would have to both have had the local cache expire - plus almost all of our live clients had very similar permissions, whereas we had some ""test"" clients with no permissions at all), whereas of course my script just called as fast as possible.<p>It was fairly easy to track down the bug once we passed the initial disbelief stage, and I don't think many clients noticed.

Three or four years in, they added a new, very expensive object to the game (a ""Pyreal Scarab"" for anyone who cares). It cost a lot, so the idea was that people wouldn't be (at that point in the economy) buying many.<p>Now, in Asheron's Call, the world is <i>huge</i>. There are hundreds, if not thousands of vendors. And three of these vendors were set to sell their goods in stacks of up to 1000. Unfortunately, Cost of Pyreal Scrab * 1000 > 2^31, which wrapped. I can't remember if you either just got the goods for free (which you then sold back for huge profit), or if you actually got paid to take these things. Either way, overnight, the economy was destroyed. The entire game state had to be reset from backups; a dreaded <i>rollback</i>. Worse, the developer took a few days to do this.<p>Trust me, out of all the customers whose data you <i>don't</i> want to muss with, it's hardcore MMORPG players.

America's legal system has become so broad that anyone can be arrested, and the obvious result of that has been that America has the largest prison population of any country in the world by an order of magnitude.<p>Law enforcement is not about catching <i>all</i> criminals, nor is it about preventing <i>all</i> crimes.  The power we give to law enforcement must be balanced with the need to preserve a free society.  The more power the police are given, the easier it is to enforce oppressive laws, and by extension to create oppressive laws in the first place.  We limit the use of police power with complicated procedures and requirements for that very reason.<p>It is also the case that expanded law enforcement powers tend to disproportionately impact certain minorities due to the disproportionate attention given to those communities by the police.  As things are <i>now</i>, there are black communities in America where a quarter of the men are in prison or have been imprisoned.  It is a near-certainty that if the FBI's proposal becomes law, the new wiretapping power will be disproportionately applied to already-oppressed minorities.<p>""I understand that the situation is different in authoritarian countries.""<p>The sad truth is that right now, nobody can truly know that they have never committed a felony.  As an example, large numbers of Virginians naively believed that living with their boyfriend/girlfriend was perfectly legal; yet until a few weeks ago, it was a crime:<p><a href=""http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/02/03/virginia-weird-laws-sodomy-cohabitation_n_2609265.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/02/03/virginia-weird-laws...</a><p>It is by the selective application of these surprise laws that the US government is able to achieve an effect similar to that of a authoritarian government.

What do we call people who are good at some of the other disciplines?<p>I've spent bits of my career working with fairly large data sets at one time or another, and providing discovery, insight and analytic tools into that data, but very little of it seems to have anything remotely to do with what the job descriptions for ""Data Scientist"" are asking for.<p>Consider this, building a very large graph of the internet, then using various models on that graph to find unique and actionable insights: such as finding routing bottlenecks for a video delivery service, involves lots of data, lots of scientific like exploration, yet isn't a ""data scientist"" job by the job reqs.<p>How about this, building a text parser that can finely categorize and make recommendations for a research organization based on millions of grant proposals, all categorized into various ""mission silos"" that research organization is built around. Not a ""data scientist"" job.<p>Analyze multi-lingual news stories to build a real-time alert system for conflict analysts. Not a ""data scientist"" job.<p>Building a tool that can scan multi-spectral aerial imagery and automatically extrapolate man-made structures from natural, catalog all of the different vehicle makes and models, and generate a predictive model of commuting patterns, or make recommendations for housing development based on perceived socio-economic conditions? Not a data-scientist job.<p>Collecting information on who propositions who from a dating web site, normalizing the data for population and writing a report on the findings? <i>That's</i> a ""data scientist's"" job.<p>It's not that that kind of work isn't valuable, only that there are so many other kinds of things that involve what might intuitively be called ""data science"" that calling just the one discipline ""data science"" is doing a disservice to what should be an amazing discipline -- part Computer Scientist, Part Analyst.",1368025614

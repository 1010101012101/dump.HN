7616646,comment,7615228,7615562,1,0,richardfontana,,,"I&#x27;ve been using a double-edge safety razor for almost two years now, after having used cartridge razors for many years, since my mid-teens. On average, I would say, I get closer shaves. The improvement is not as dramatic as I had initially hoped. I have not attempted to measure the savings but I suspect they are significant following the main outlay of the razor itself. Blades are incredibly cheap, compared to cartridges (and I&#x27;d say that for me the optimal replacement durations are about the same). Glycerin shaving soap units last a <i>long</i> time, relative to a unit of shaving cream or shaving gel. The activity of shaving (including the use of a badger-hair shaving brush) has become less of a chore and at least marginally closer to an enjoyable ritual. While I still use cartridge razors when traveling (unless I am certain I am going to check baggage), I bring my shaving soap and shaving brush with me to have part of the experience.<p>I recommend any cartridge-razor shavers (or users of electric shavers, if anyone still uses those suboptimal devices) give safety razors a try.",1397998719

For encryption to provide real security, you need to solve key distribution, which for all practical purposes is unsolved.<p>And no, when you claim that HTTPS has &quot;not many optional layers in between&quot; that mostly suggests that you just treat it as a black box rather than that there is no complexity there. The simplicity is in the user interface only, and that is arguably broken because it does not actually reliably reflect actual security.<p>Really, once again, you mostly make the impression that you don&#x27;t really understand the problems with email and just think that it&#x27;s broken because it&#x27;s old. Anyone with that attitude is likely to just repeat all the same mistakes that we&#x27;ve been through with email, and in the end not solve any of the actual problems.",1397998693

They have a search engine which is powerful and Google probably can invest more money to do code search and data search quickly.<p>What irritates me is that we have a broken system.

Most of your counter-arguments are based on critiques of redirecting profits, which in our case is not what&#x27;s going on. That said, you are right that generally companies shouldn&#x27;t pay dividends if they have something better to do with the cash.<p>However, I&#x27;d make the argument that paying above market for top talent is about the best thing a startup can do to increase its likelihood for continued success.<p>So why did we choose revenue growth instead of profits as the basis for the bonus plan? Profits are easily gamed and frankly rare in startups and would not make for an appropriate metric to base bonuses on for an early-stage company.<p>I am not sure I follow your points about metrics, transparency, valuations, etc. Those seem like concerns unrelated to the structure for giving employees exposure to our financial upside.<p>Our #1 metric is revenue growth. That&#x27;s what we want our team focused on. Not vanity metrics, not profits even. That&#x27;s a management concern. Our bonus plans cover multi-year terms, and they motivate one to do the right thing in the long-term vs short term. There are no issues with gaming the bonus program; moving $1 of revenue forward/backwards by a few months has no effect. Making an extra $1 now at the expense of $2 next year is not rewarded. &quot;Top management&quot; still has to approve overall direction and operational processes, so it&#x27;s not like anyone even has the opportunity to game revenue numbers at the expense of operating margin. Besides that, we hire good people and if you can&#x27;t trust<p>I will say that for some types of models (eg Twitter) this wouldn&#x27;t work as it&#x27;s a free-as-in-beer product until they can start doing advertising.

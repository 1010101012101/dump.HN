Some great ideas are easy to pitch, others are not.  No correlation.<p>- There is a direct correlation between a mediocre idea and ease in pitching it.

Personally speaking, CouchDB is better than a lot of the companies that they have funded, and it's truly innovative.<p>If Steve Jobs didn't have Woz, he would be a used-car salesman right now.  Woz essentially invented the PC.  He could find a thousand people like Jobs in any MBA program.  Sure marketing is important, but it's frosting on the technology cake.

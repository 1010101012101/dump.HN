2805489,comment,2802281,2802807,1,0,bradleyland,,,"I think you're contemplating the attack vectors from the wrong direction. We're not necessarily talking machines with open ports on internet facing IP addresses. Think about it from the other direction.<p>The root of the problem lies at the feet of a few factors:<p>A) HTTP is a relatively ""trusted"" protocol, which means you should be very, very careful about running local services over HTTP (on any port) that can do bad things™ to your computer.<p>B) <a href=""http://localhost:3000/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://localhost:3000/</a> isn't difficult to guess. If you know someone is a Rails developer, there is a good chance that embedding requests to that URL will hit a Rails dev environment at some point, and that's where this thing is going to end up running.<p>C) Eval, in general, is just about the right length of rope to hang yourself with. Use sparingly and with great respect for its ability to completely hose you. Passing anything sent as HTTP params to eval is just asking for it.<p>Knowing the above, consider an example like Patrick (patio11) outlines above.<p>Let's say this takes off and people start using it. This means that some percentage of Rails devs have this running. To attack their machines, I need only to trick their machine in to making a request to '<a href=""http://localhost:3000/malicious-string-here"" rel=""nofollow"">http://localhost:3000/malicious-string-here</a>.<p>How might I accomplish that? I like Patrick's suggestion of an img tag src attribute. There are plenty of forums that treat img tags as safe, or provide some means of embedding images with arbitrary src attributes.<p>So let's say I head over to railsnewbforum.com and embed the malicious image in my sig. Then I start happily posting useful information in every thread on the board. Assuming this webconsole takes off, how long until a vulnerable dev hits a page with my malicious signature code and gets pwnd?<p>Can this be made safe? Probably to some degree, but then it would involve many of the security measures involved with using the Rails console over an ssh session or something similar.<p>IMO, it's not worth the risk.",1311641723
2805487,comment,2804231,2804231,1,0,ShabbyDoo,,,"There's so much wrong with this article.  First of all, two ideas are artificially intertwined: (1) paying for an app server and (2) using an app server.  JBoss is open source just like Tomcat.  You can pay RedHat for JBoss support, and you can pay SpringSource (and, for that matter, others) for Tomcat support.  Given how expensive Weblogic and Websphere are coupled with how incredibly good JBoss is, you would be hard-pressed to justify writing checks to IBM or Oracle.  If you want support, use JBoss and write a check for 1/10 as much.  Their support actually kicks ass.<p>""Use Spring, and you don’t need an EJB-compliant container.""<p>Huh?  Does JdbcTemplate now count as a suitable replacement for a transacted ORM?  Perhaps the author is referring to Spring's wrappers around other ORMs like Hibernate?<p>"" Manageability is super important, but all I want to know is: 1) Is the server up; 2) is my end-user performance acceptable; 3) has my fault-tolerant architecture kicked-in to solve either problem?""<p>The open source version of tomcat his shitty management features.  If you want even reasonable manageability, you'll have to pay for SpringSource's TC server or something similar.<p>""has my fault-tolerant architecture kicked-in""<p>What fault-tolerant architecture?  Tomcat's clustered session replication?<p>""I highly recommend elastic caching platforms (ECP) since it is a technology that is independent of the application server and super-fast. ""<p>You know who makes a really good open source one?  JBoss :)  And, it's transactional!  But, you need a transaction manager if you want to do 2PC with your DB.  And, guess what doesn't come with a TM?  That's right, Tomcat.<p>""I question even the need for a container. Seriously, why can’t Java web applications just run on the operating system like the containerless Microsoft .NET applications? ""<p>[Note that I don't know a darned thing about .NET, so I'm speculating a bit]  Ummmm...in this case, isn't Windows acting as the container?  So, if I create a Linux distro with Java/JBoss included, does this satisfy his need?<p>""The next generation is elastic application platforms (EAP) that are containerless.""<p>What's up with this obsession about ""containerless"" platforms?  Isn't this like saying, ""I want a platform, but I don't want it to be a platform""?  The whole idea of a platform/container/framework is that someone else handles a bunch of cross-cutting concerns for you so that you can concentrate on the business-y aspects of your app.  Servlets are much more convenient than binding to a socket and serving up HTTP by processing incoming byte streams.  Furthermore, how can any of these in-the-cloud offerings be containerless?",1311641710

2805484,comment,2805113,2805392,10,0,joshcrews,,,"I recommend to devs to take this a little bit farther.  If a dev is willing to work overtime ""if we have immediate deadlines"", management will increase the frequency and urgency of deadlines.<p>Rather commit to working overtime if the company/team will miss a deadline that you committed to for a reason that you are responsible for.  That closes temptation to create deadlines that you never committed to.<p>An example:  \nManager: Dev, we need you to stay extra because we've got to get Facebook Connect integrated by tomorrow!<p>Dev: I wish we'd talked about if that was a reasonable expectation given the other development priorities we have for this week.  Next time we have a feature with a deadline, ask me in advance and I can tell you the earliest date I can guarantee it can be finished by.<p>Then be reasonable, with a good buffer, about future deadline commitments.  If you make a commitment, keep it.  If you have a deadline commitment, and a new ""urgent"" request comes in, you can then ask the manager if they'd rather you delay the new request to honor the first deadline, or if they'd like to push back the deadline of the original request.<p>Using this I never worked evenings or weekends when I was an employee",1311641663

An alternatively the legal argument is that software is mathematics and mathematics is not legally patentable.<p>And the economic argument is that these monopolies are used by established players to stifle innovation, for example the history of flight in Europe and the US, where the Wright brothers patents killed innovation.<p>I think it is a really hard issue, because I don't think it can be determined well with any system of governance that we have.

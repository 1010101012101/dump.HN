To me the problems with C++ templates arise from their verbosity (Go&#x27;s type system is rigid, but defining types is easy and encouraged and the compiler does inference for variable declarations), their abuse (let&#x27;s keep it to simple type insertion), and the nasty errors / debugging (Go&#x27;s type system rigidity should also help here).<p>Just being able to do very light type insertion and the transparent code generation to go along with it would go a long way.",1418738354

8757098,comment,8756772,8756834,0,0,ultramancool,,,"There are of course simple ways around that sort of issue. You can create a 2 VM system:<p>- proxy VM - 2 NICs, one public, one internal to VMs only, runs Tor, exposes only Tor SOCKS5 port to internal network, firewalls everything else<p>- main VM - 1 NIC, internal only, connects only to other VM on Tor SOCKS5 port. Preventing any application from being able to connect. This VM needs to be somewhat locked down from the host at minimum though, no VM file sharing, probably best to avoid other VM services too.<p>The only way to break this scheme would be to exploit the Tor proxy port itself to break into the proxy VM from the main VM or to break out of the VM itself. Likely harder than a large codebase like Firefox/Java/Flash. Of course, remember to snapshot and restore once you&#x27;re configured to avoid any risk of persistent malware.",1418738248

I&#x27;ve employed quite a few people over the years, had some good times, some bad.  You know : The basic entrepreneurial story.  I started programming with 6502 machine code, C, C++, Perl, and more recently Python, Scala and GPUs.   Will likely start something to do with deep-learning/NLP in the New Year.  HN feels like home.  That&#x27;s why I&#x27;m here.<p>As to the content of my comment : It was intentionally low.

8756908,comment,8755610,8756813,0,0,jasonisalive,,,"Hunting is a traditional activity among Pakeha farmers and farming communities in Aotearoa. These people came from lower and middle class British communities, and enthusiastically began hunting in Aotearoa because in Britain it was traditionally an upper-class-only privilege. As such it is and has always been primarily been a leisure activity. Nowadays Pakeha culture is strongest in rural areas so the hunting continues and is part of a grid of activities (rugby, agricultural shows, many varieties of sport, other farming-centric activities) which strengthen in-group bonds.<p>Maori hunted extensively for subsistence, primarily bird and fish species, but this was more trapping and gathering (rope traps for birds, gathering bivalves). In recent times their culture has become more urban-based, relatively young and lower SES, and I think they are more involved and interested these days in urban family/community ties, Marae activities, travel and international youth culture. Maori groups promote the traditional ecology of the islands, and promote the authenticity of traditional Maori food-gathering, but especially given the scarcity of native birdlife, don&#x27;t actually hunt birds anymore (as far as I&#x27;m aware - though shell-gathering is popular).<p>The university-liberal segment of Pakeha culture that is pro-Maori is generally pretty pacifist and urban, so they don&#x27;t participate in rural-centric activities like hunting.<p>I think Maori people in Aotearoa taking up white-style hunting would be like native tribes in America turning into massive baseball lovers.",1418735164
8756907,comment,8754775,8756457,0,0,jzwinck,,,"In an old-school helcopter you have, say, one main rotor with a vertical shaft, and one tail rotor with a horizontal shaft.  Each of them has complex control mechanisms implemented in hardware: the main rotor has swash plates, and so does the tail rotor (or it has variable speed).  The pilot controls the system in a direct and even crude way: a side stick adjusts blade pitch, sometimes via a simple cable linkage.  Throttle is kept quite stable much of the time.<p>In this newfangled bird, we use some combination of GPS sensors, an input which is presumably a touchscreen (with all the associated latency, plus wireless), and a speed controller which has to adjust multiple times per revolution of the rotors.

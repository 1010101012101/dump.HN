7083289,comment,7083151,7083151,34,0,eshvk,,,">  New York is pretty impressed by a billion dollars even if you merely inherited it. In Silicon Valley no one would care except a few real estate agents.<p>The only defining common factor of all the VC shops in the bay area is money. Sure a lot of them made that money in tech but it is money that lets them have power.<p>Also some anecdotal impressions:<p>I lived in SF for two years. I think the constant humdrum of tech (specifically a strange breed of big data + machine learning + web tech) is making the place intolerably insular. When I first moved there, I thought the opinionated twenty something year olds who think that their youth and opinions mean that they matter were cute. Now, it is just fucking insufferable. Building a company shouldn&#x27;t be purely about getting sold, acqui-hired or building products that no one outside your iphone addled tech circle will use.<p>I think there is utility in moving out of the bay area to build real products. I recently moved to NYC. The tech scene feels refreshingly small, surprisingly under-dog like, I am reminded of Austin. Most tech folks I meet here are mellow, there is also a large overlap with incredibly smart ex-finance people who are humble and sociable.<p>Everything also doesn&#x27;t seem to be focused on shipping your shitty product and tweeting about it, there is focus on building something that is not primarily focused on acqui-hired or VC-driven.<p>Also, more importantly, NYC is superior to San Francisco as a place for your social life. The men:women ratio is way more balanced, you are constantly reminded that your &quot;coding skills&quot; are not all that define you. When I first came to interview here, I had serious misgivings about the place (the climate is miserable), yet I think the thing that made me decide to move here was a conversation I over-heard in a coffee shop between two girls. It was about Python. The snake, not the language.",1390102741

Why?<p>In America, everything is about individualism. People are supposed to be different from each other. Everybody may not have a job, but people understand it as &#x27;The American Dream&#x27;, just one of the ways in which people dream of being more different by being successful. As a result, not everybody has money to live, but this is understood as a necessary sacrifice. American individualism means that people love guns and are okay with each other having guns. Often times this means that people will live apart from each other in the country in large mansions and in seeming happiness. People also live together in large interesting cities, like New York or San Francisco, but when they do so, they make a point to appear different from each other. How have they achieved this?<p>To understand the American way, you must understand a few concepts that are deeply rooted into the culture.<p>< Cowboy role model ><p>The Cowboy adhered to a way of life, ethics, rules, and a code that spread to all branches of society, and even today affects the way the American thinks.<p>- The Horse offered the Cowboy a sense of independence and self-sufficiency.<p>- The Frontier taught them to be ruthless and self-motivated.<p>- The Town taught them diversity and how to interact with many different kinds of people, including bartenders, sherrifs, outlaws, townspeople, and other cowboys.<p>- Justice, and honor are central. Toughness, manliness, concealed emotion, independence, and resourcefulness are important key values.<p>Though the cowboy no longer exists, this way of viewing life is ever-present in society. Students quit school early to seek independent projects they call &#x27;Entrepreneurs&#x27;. Workers within a company see each other as opposing cowboys. The American is independent, performance-oriented, and mercenary at work. He/She tries to improve themselves every day and to move from company to company, just as the cowboy galloped across different terrains in their time.",1390102145

It would be simple to add password as well. The problem is, if your machine is still powered on, they can patch into the PCI bus and dump your RAM using DMA[2]. Most disk encryption stores the master key in RAM, so if they can dump your RAM they can decrypt your harddrive. GAME OVER!<p>You really want something that cuts power to your laptop so all state is lost. It&#x27;s not hard to build such a thing:<p>1. Setup your laptop to use full disk encryption,<p>2. remove the battery from your laptop,<p>3. pull the power cord to &quot;instantly log out&quot;.<p>One could even attach a string from the power cord to the door so that the laptop loses power if the door is opened. Cold-boot attacks[3], where they remove your RAM before it loses state, could be a concern, but they would have to disassemble your laptop very very quickly (within 30 seconds, perhaps longer if they just threw the laptop into a tub of liquid nitrogen). A counter measure would be to epoxy your laptop together to prevent quick disassembly (or use a macbook air those things are impossible to take apart quickly and the RAM is soldered in place).<p>It should be standard operating procedure to randomly overwrite all non-OS data stored RAM when a user logs out.

As Wintamute said in another thread, large projects have a lot of needs, and streaming isn&#x27;t enough for all (most?) of them. Gulp&#x27;s creators were pretty adamant about not supporting other use cases when this came up on Twitter. [1]<p>Another issue with Gulp is that it&#x27;s highly concurrent. Although that seems like a nice idea for speed, I suspect it will lead to a lot of hard-to-write and hard-to-debug edge cases. I&#x27;ve already heard reports of people getting strange behavior from their Gulpfiles [2].<p>At this point, I&#x27;d take a &quot;wait and see&quot; approach with Gulp unless you like playing with build tools or if you really need its focus on speed. If you&#x27;re looking for a good build tool for that lets you &quot;just run JavaScript,&quot; I&#x27;d check out Jake [3] instead. And of course, Grunt [4] is the current leader for JS builds, thanks to its immense plugin library.<p>If you&#x27;re interested in a more in-depth review of Gulp, I have one here: [5]<p>[1] The Twitter thread: <a href=""https://twitter.com/funkytek/status/423762923421302784"" rel=""nofollow"">https://twitter.com/funkytek/status/423762923421302784</a><p>[2] Somebody runs into strange behavior from Gulp: <a href=""http://www.reddit.com/r/javascript/comments/1v4tez/bottom_line_right_now_gulp_is_too_focused_on_its/cep25ac"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.reddit.com/r/javascript/comments/1v4tez/bottom_li...</a><p>[3] Jake: <a href=""https://github.com/mde/jake"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/mde/jake</a><p>[4] Grunt: <a href=""http://gruntjs.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://gruntjs.com/</a><p>[5] My Gulp review: <a href=""http://www.letscodejavascript.com/v3/comments/lab/1#comment-1197581116"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.letscodejavascript.com/v3/comments/lab/1#comment-...</a>",1390100630
7083219,comment,7083151,7083151,45,0,_delirium,,,"Living for a few years in the Bay Area, I didn&#x27;t really end up with the same impression, though that could be my fault. My biggest impression was that the Bay Area <i>wants</i> to be extremely wealthy, but feels slightly inadequate about it. There was a constant palpable rivalry with both NYC and Southern California, a rivalry that was mostly one-directional. And on the Peninsula, in particular, there was a strangely obvious class structure. In particular the startup scene around Stanford was super-weird. I didn&#x27;t know the Googlers (wrong years), but the kids I knew ranged from &quot;comfortably upper-middle-class&quot; to &quot;extremely wealthy&quot;. Mostly my peers were their employees, not in the founder social group; the founder social group had a remarkable ability to raise &quot;friends & family&quot; money despite having no product (the most recent raised $750,000 from a company in China owned by an uncle, to develop mobile games).  The demographics are so unbalanced that Stanford actually will give an automatic full-ride scholarship to any accepted student whose family makes under $100,000/yr, since not many admitted students qualify for it anyway.<p>Overall I don&#x27;t really miss it, though I did like eating VC food and drinking VC beer at the ubiquitous lavish parties. But the culture might be even weirder than NYC, in terms of what it promotes.",1390100595

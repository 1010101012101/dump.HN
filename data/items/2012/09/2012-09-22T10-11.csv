There are no broken antennas, and MobileMe didn't crash. Sounds like a company just released a brand new product and there are some small bugs to work out. Which it what I would expect, from any company. We all know Samsung has bugs, MS Windows 8 has bugs, Nokia 920 has bugs. When I got a Galaxy S, 2 years ago, I received an OTA update v2.2.2, it bricked my phone. It bricked a lot of peoples phones. They stopped doing OTAs after that. Then the GPS didn't work. That was sort of accepted as a flaw in the GS v2.2.2. I had to root my phone and run a third party hack to get it to work. The mp3 player had a button to view music by album but tapping it would crash the player. That wasn't fixed until much later, v2.3.4, 9months after google released it. Had to use my brothers PC, install software on PC to install sw update on phone. Ridiculous. Virtually no updates to touchwiz UI. Garbage! Calls were always dropped constantly. Then I got a GS2. It would crash... all the time. I had to reboot nearly everyday. That is sort of expected with the GS2. Calls were dropped all the time. Text messages wound't come through on Google Voice. The control buttons on the headphones worked erratically but mostly not at all. TouchWiz is a disaster. Battery life was maybe 8 hours of standby. I had to charge to phone two times a day. The phone IS TOO FUCKING BIG! Trying to use the phone one handed, the thumb muscle would touch the screen before the tip of the thumb causing unintentional taps. These are 'real' user issues. What droidfans aren't saying is that Android is rough, and they like to fiddle with it, they like to mod it and install patches, and break it and reinstall it, and fuck with it some more. This is why there is no waiting lines for Samsung products. The 'sheeple' like expensive shit that works. I mean works as in 'doesn't crash everyday', not 'boo hoo, the bridge in my maps looks funny [frown-face], this is awful I think I will go shoot myself!1!!'<p>I understand people are having a problem with maps but most of the blogs are complete hyperbole right now, and the maps are working great for me in NYC. Public transit was never very helpful by google maps because ""public transit is underground!"" Welcome to the big city. Thus no network connectivity. No one is having ""real"" problems with the new iPhone. This is all BS for the purpose of getting visitors to a shitty blog. No Apple has not lost its way. iPhone 5 is amazing says nearly all reports. iOS 6 is great. There are some bugs. The total package is what I would expect from Apple, past or present.",1348310623

4557562,comment,4556572,4556572,9,0,tokenadult,,,"I have been on online networks of one kind or another since 1992. I am 100 percent behind the idea that people using their real names (the rule of some networks I have been on) promotes better online community and people taking more responsibility for their personal behavior in the community. That said, I do have some friends who have long established pseudonyms that have most of the good effects of real names, because those friends still try to build up reputation for those pseudonyms. (You'll have to be the judge of how well I'm doing here building up the reputation of ""tokenadult,"" a screen name I brought here from two other online communities where pseudonyms rather than real names are mandatory but changing names is difficult so that reputation still accumulates for each name.)<p>That said, I refuse to ""out"" my niece's dog, who has a Facebook profile. It's important to have amusing counterexamples out there so that people don't invest too much trust in Facebook. In the last week or so a Hacker News participant (I don't know his real name [smile]) suggested that Facebook could monetize by being an online payments platform. For consumer-to-business transactions, I don't trust Facebook as a payment platform because its engineers have the attitude ""Don't be afraid to break things,"" which just doesn't appeal to me for a network that handles my financial data. For user-to-user transactions, I also don't trust Facebook because I don't trust the users unless I know them in person--my Facebook community is enjoyable because it really consists of people whose real identity I know, and who know me. If I want to do business with strangers, I occasionally do that through Amazon Marketplace, but that is because Amazon has built up its own reputation for standing behind transactions there.<p>AFTER EDIT: Several comments in this thread are along the lines of<p><i>It's not hard to imagine a near future, if not a present, in which a person's identity is entirely evaluated, shaped, and determined by a monolith such as facebook.</i><p>But most people in the world still are largely stuck with the reputations distorted for them, before they can develop their reputations for themselves, by their family or their classmates in some small community. Facebook is LESS of a ""monolith,"" because it is made up of hundreds of millions of users, than any small town anywhere. A lot of people find it liberating to find online communities based on shared intellectual interests (Hacker News works for this too, of course) rather than just being stuck with their current group of in-person acquaintances.",1348310218

4557532,comment,4556838,4557470,8,0,chubot,,,"OK, but you're making an observation without a solution... that kind of thing is pretty much irrelevant to people like Paul Graham and CEOs of startups, who have to make decisions about what things to do.  You can call people immoral from the sidelines but it will have zero effect.<p>My opinion is that corporations are essentially ""amoral"" -- not immoral.  Morality simply doesn't enter into any substantive decision.  Google's founders often invoke the self-interest argument: ""people don't have to trust us to be moral, because if we acted against our users, they would leave us, and we wouldn't make any money"".  This is what I call an amoral argument -- with no negative connotation to ""amoral"".  PG almost invoked a version of this in footnote 8.<p>You might think that being amoral is equivalent to being immoral, but morality isn't as well-formed a concept as people think it is.  Namely, the most common use of the concept of immorality is to label ""stuff I don't like"".  I mean, what's wrong with millions of people playing Zynga games all day?  Would people be curing cancer if they weren't playing Zynga games?<p>Another issue is that a person isn't moral or immoral; it's well known that the same person will act moral or immoral according to their environment.  Paul Graham even said that about HN (in terms of trollish behavior).  (See <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundamental_attribution_error"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundamental_attribution_error</a>)<p>In the case of Wall St, there's no possibility of it ""considering its own morality"".  No amount of goading or convincing will make an ounce of difference.  The only way I can think of is for voters to make it clear to elected officials that they won't tolerate the status quo, but so far that hasn't happened.  Even after the 2009 crash.<p>(And btw I didn't make any assertion about morality in my original message, other than to say ""I somewhat agree"" about Zynga, so not sure what you are disagreeing with.)",1348308561

There's a reason why Zynga games' growth aren't sustainable and they need to rely on the novelty of games to grow.<p>I'm sure even Blizzard and Steam teams are very focused on growth as a metric. It's just that unlike Zynga, they believe that creating fun mechanics in their games and improving on them through patches make for a great way to move their needle. Therein lies the difference. I guess the focus shouldn't just be growth at all cost, but sustainable growth.",1348308269

The other games you mention are also good examples of starups in high-growth terms.

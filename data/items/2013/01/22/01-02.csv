This is not a conference-level problem; it is a problem that starts <i>much earlier in life</i> and which will only be fixed <i>by solving it earlier in life</i>.  Go to middle schools and figure out why girls who were doing well in math and science in elementary school suddenly lost interest in those subjects, and once you have worked your way from there to having more diversity in technical professions, we can talk about whatever diversity problems are left at conferences.",1358819998
5095067,comment,5094680,5095025,2,0,marquis,,,"I recently attended 2 birthday parties for young kids, one on a weekday and one on a Saturday afternoon. The first, was mostly mothers, immediate family and their kids. For the second, the couple went <i>out of their way</i> to make sure that men could come to the birthday party. They send out adult invites encouraging alcohol beverages to be brought, and called all their women friends and asked them firmly to bring their boyfriends. I brought mine, who was begrudgingly included because of his perception it would be full of kids and women but he ended up having a wonderful time talking to other men (as well as hanging out with kids and their toys and of course some classic kids party food). Is this discrimination on the couple's part to try and reach past a culture of birthday parties full of just mothers and their kids?",1358819960
5095066,comment,5094127,5094127,3,0,sveiss,,,"Email delivery over SMTP works on a store-and-forward model: when you send an email, it first goes to your outgoing mail server, which then connects to a mail server at the destination domain and sends the message to it. The mail server at the destination then has the responsibility of sending the mail on to the receiving user (perhaps it gets routed through a spam filter, then to a storage server to wait until the receiving user opens their mail client).<p>Because the source mail server forwards the message on, it loses control of it -- the most it could do is send a ""please delete this message I sent you and forget I sent it"" message to the mail server at the destination domain. The destination mail server wouldn't be obliged to act on it -- it could have forgotten where it forwarded the original mail on to, or it could instead decide to send a 'Hey! Look what somebody doesn't what you to read!' message in big flashing letters to the original recipient.<p>AOL and corporate mail systems can implement this because they control the destination mail servers, as well as the sending mail server. On the wider Internet, you'd need to replace SMTP with a protocol whereby the message is stored near to the sender, rather than near the recipient, until the destination user reads it. There are some good arguments in favor of a system like this (it could make spammers bear more of the cost of sending their spam, for instance), but uprooting a fundamental protocol and replacing it with something else isn't an easy task to do on a network as big as the Internet.",1358819958

5095064,comment,5094680,5095012,2,0,fatbird,,,"In this (and other similar) case(s), we can conclude that there's no difference between male and female speakers, since the gender ratio resulting from blind judging matches the submission pool.  In other words, there's no essential gender difference in technology, there's just a demographic artifact of sexism.<p>So if the larger demographic continues to mirror that artifact, that's not an argument for reproducing that artificial split in the conference.  Indeed, taking care to mix the submissions pool to reflect the larger gender split does nothing but perpetuate an artificial and historical and culturally driven imbalance, when we can clearly see that no essential difference between the sexes exists.  It's not discriminatory to balance out a contingent happenstance that doesn't accurately reflect essential differences.<p>A bit shorter: There's nothing discriminatory about the removal of undeserved advantage.",1358819941

A lot did change for the better between 1992 and 1996.  I think sealing is a big example of that.

5095049,comment,5092711,5094769,8,0,niggler,,,"If you paid attention to the Murdoch issue you'd actually realize each of your facts parallel a facet of the phone hacking scandal:<p>A) Your purported argument about scale really suggests that YC may have more investments than they can reasonably manage, but that doesn't absolve them from blame.  This is <i>EXACTLY</i> the same argument Rupert Murdoch made (We have so many newspapers that we couldn't possibly be aware of hacking at one paper)<p>B) Your sixth fact is<p><pre><code>    6. ...even though they aren't in YC for IM, YC has no real influence or control over IM or even the team.\n</code></pre>\nThere are actually two parts here, and I'd like to hone into the first for a moment:  ""even though they aren't in YC for IM"".  It seems <i>VERY</i> odd that PG would allow companies to pivot <i>without first</i> having an office hour or discussion with partners on the matter, and if what you are saying is true then there are deep procedural issues.  Murdoch tried to make the same argument regarding autonomy of the individual units under News Corp.<p>C) Your second and third fact focus on partners and alumni.  They have additional senior staff, so how was this allowed to happen?  If the partners and alumni did share the same mores as PG purports to hold now, and if at least one partner or alumnus dealt with IM, then there's an internal inconsistency (akin to blaming rebekah brooks for what is really a cultural issue)<p>D) Your fourth fact tries to argue that this is a single bad apple.  It's the first instance being reported.  Of course it's an <i>isolated</i> incident insofar as no other company attempted the same effort, which is exactly what James Murdoch claimed regarding News of the World.<p>E) "" Immediately after it being brought to his attention, PG followed up with the owners and they made some changes as a result...""<p>The problem is that the underlying problem wasn't resolved.  PG decided to point to the TOS, which doesn't address the nature of the business model.  This is akin to James pointing to ATT's terms of service and security model.<p>I'm pretty sure that for whatever ""fact"" you wish to throw there's an analogue, and until there's some sort of real ""accountability"" I don't see how you could have such unwavering support.<p>My expectation is simple: if YC wants to invest in those types of firms, that's their prerogative and they should own their decision.   Don't try to pull some cognitive dissonance.  Just say that you are comfortable with investing in the malware model, and this entire discussion would be moot.  The only reason my reply makes sense is because PG and YC claim to aspire to something higher.  If we all drop that assumption, then the original issue is really irrelevant.<p>And with regards to your last comment: "" YC explicitly looks for people doing things that might seem questionable at first."", I think you misunderstand what 'questionable' means there.  Questionable there means ""i doubt it could succeed"", not ""shady business practices"".",1358819784

A thousand times this.<p>Most people who know me consider me a rational guy. I'm the type that reads LessWrong, understands cognitive biases and knows who Kahneman & Tversky are.<p>But I find myself with a deep...dislike of Apple. I fully admit that their products are superb.

As someone who loves money, I respect a company that rose from the ashes to having 100+ billion dollars in the bank.<p>But the notion that some guy deep in the bowels of Cupertino knows what I want more than I do makes me recoil violently. I think it's the libertarian in me. I have an inherent distrust of, and contempt for institutions, particularly when they want to decide what's 'right' for me.

Things get socially very awkward and uncomfortable for everybody when you have a school where almost all students live on campus and socialize primarily with fellow students, and the male/female distribution is severely unbalanced, and so getting more women was a priority.<p>Gender was not considered when deciding on an applicant, but they made quite an effort to get more qualified women to apply, and to get those who did and were offered admission to choose Caltech.<p>This isn't the fastest way to balance the population (when I was there, 10 years later, they were only up to 15-20% women, and are up to around 40% now), but it allowed them to keep their high standards.",1358819256

You can have a trading company with just a trader. You can have a tech company with just a program.

At an animation company everyone is support staff for the animators. etc...<p>That's reflected in your position at the company.<p>Now for the ""it depends"" part. If it doesn't bother you to be support staff because the stuff you do you enjoy or because being part of the team of someone making that kind of entertainment is enough reward then fine.<p>There's also always exceptions. For example there are programmers who have advanced the state of the art of CG while at those companies (the hair in Monsters Ink, The water in The Perfect Storm, the crowds in Lord of the Rings) etc.. so if you fancy yourself someone who can advance that state of the art you might find that appealing.

Its not any specific information I have read, its just a collective pressure that weakens those regimes and those who support them.<p>Take Burma as an example - the leadership got sick of the failed state, the abysmal economy, the boycott against regime sons and daughters - an absolutely brillant plan whereby countries simply dont accept sons, daughters, and other family members of dictatorships; this hits where it hurts, on a personal level, when you might the the king in your country with $Bns stolen from the people in a bank account but your daughter cant go to school in Australia or fly to Paris.

Logic, reason, and anything else no longer works for you, you can't think straight anymore and any thought just hurts you like a hot knife slicing into your brain. Every bad moment in your life plays out in your head, and each one just kills you inside a bit. You cannot even remember the good moments, you cannot recall that you have friends and family members who love you. You feel like nobody cares about you and everyone hates you and wants you to die.<p>I really don't know how I got out of it, except my attempts failed because I didn't do massive things like gunshot to the head or whatever, I did things that could be undone like overdose, etc. It was the only control I had at the time to survive, pick my way to die, and pick one that others can undo when they find me.<p>I got so sick working, that I developed schizoaffective disorder from the stress, and workplace bullies who abused me daily.

Sure they could release TextEdit for iOS but that does not solve the real problem or address the problems of portability of data between iOS apps.

It's like an erupting storm. It starts with something small -- some tiny failure which a normal person might say ""okay, no biggie, I can deal with that."" My problem was the multiplication. We have associative memories, and I as a depressed person immediately associated this failure with other recent failures, which associated with others, and others, until there was a deluge of connections. It feels like a literal suffocation by failure -- I mean it becomes hard to breathe and there is often an ache across my chest.<p>There was often a growing sense of paranoia -- that <i>they would all find out</i>. What they would all find out was not terribly clear, but it was something as simple as ""I am useless"" or ""I'll never live up to any of their expectations."" (If you've never suffered from depression you might even wonder <i>why this is a bad thing</i> -- but that sort of metanarrative doesn't happen when you're depressed because it's just <i>obviously</i> bad, it's rejection, and rejection is <i>painful</i> emotionally, and there is no reflection.)<p>And so each thing triggers other things, until I am just left with this deep feeling that I have failed as a human, like everyone else has this thing going for them and I simply do not, and my only normalcy comes from the lucky fact that most of them are not paying any attention to me, which is also sad in its own way.<p>I live a much less stressful life now, and that helps. I try not to commit myself to any futures -- I tell people that I don't make <i>plans</i> per se but only <i>resolves</i>, so that I am sure of the direction that I'm sailing, but not what I will find. That helps with avoiding that seed of failure from which the storm starts.<p>As for the storm itself, I've found that deep breathing does more good than you'd expect, because if you're focused on your breathing then you're not associating those thoughts so much; the thoughts still swim around your head but they don't breed new ones so much, and you can kind of quietly nod at them without indulging them. This gives me a better sense of the objects around me, which actually seem to totally disappear as I disappear into myself.<p>But sometimes, I will confess, I feel duty-bound to be honest to my younger self. And so sometimes when those seeds start, even these days when I can cope, I do just let them expand and expand until I cry myself to sleep. I feel oddly at home there, as if this is some permanent part of myself which I'm oddly glad I haven't lost. But because this is now a choice, and it's voluntary, I no longer feel suicidal during these periods -- just awful.",1358816407

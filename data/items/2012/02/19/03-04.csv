Higher education has been cut hundreds of millions of dollars.<p>The article then goes on to claim that higher education serve poor people ""<i>at best, tend to do this indirectly, if at all.</i>"" The next sentence says ""<i>Most university students and professors are already middle class or higher.</i>"" If not all university students are middle class or higher then it is benefitting lower class students.  Why say ""<i>if at all</i>"" when the next sentence implies that some poor people are helped?  Does the author want professors to be poor?  Of course most professors are middle class or higher.  I expect all of them to be.<p>Then there is this statement: ""<i>The primary purpose of universities, granting credentials, is by definition exclusionary.</i>""  This sentence, together with the sentence before it, suggests the author thinks this is a bad thing.  Some students fail out of engineering.  This is a good thing because not everyone is cut out for this type of work.<p>Libraries should be open for everyone.  Universities should not grant degrees to everyone.  The functions of libraries and universities are disparate.  It's fine to think one is more important than the other.

The monopolistic nature of this system is nicely illustrated by the ""diploma mills"" that allow people to get hired for the job requiring a diploma without completing the education program, perform their jobs successfully for considerable amount of time and then when/if discovered ""cheating"" get fired - without actually failing to do their job at any point, just because they don't have the degree. Granted this is logical from the employers point of view as the legal liability is huge but that's the result of the system.<p>>I think it's ironic that the OP used a computer and the internet to publish his propagandist rant; an action that would've been impossible without all the academic research into computing and networking systems in the last few decades.

And we're looking for more than just a few nicely written anecdotes.<p><i>Universities, while sometimes performing valuable research, are constantly wasting huge sums of money. Much of this money comes from loading up 17-to-21-year-olds with crippling student loans.</i><p>Universities are constantly wasting huge sums of money? How and where? I'd like to see some citations please. And why is the student loan system a criticism of the university rather than the financial aid system currently practiced in the US. Awfully muddled thinking here.<p><i>Libraries are famously impartial and nonjudgmental, and have no agenda other than to provide equitable access to information to anyone who desires it. Most university departments are rife with ideology and are hostile to conflicting views.</i><p>I'm going to ignore this bit which sounds suspiciously like right-wing propaganda.<p><i>Libraries are open and free to everyone. What they do only improves peoples prospects. The primary purpose of universities, granting credentials, is by definition exclusionary. They improve the prospects of a few at the expense of others, by fostering an environment where people are expected to have degrees before they can do anything of value, and erecting unnecessary barriers to individual prosperity.</i><p>This is a laughably poor argument. Who says people are expected to have degrees before they can do anything of value? Many of the most important innovators of our times do <i>not</i> have college degrees. And certainly nobody is erecting an unnecessary barrier to ""individual prosperity"".<p>If society or more specifically big business values college degrees, this isn't an indictment of the university itself and the solution certainly isn't to reduce funding so that fewer degrees are given out. Also, it's not a zero-sum game. Granting certifications to a few doesn't improve their prospects <i>at the expense</i> of others.<p>I think it's ironic that the OP used a computer and the internet to publish his propagandist rant; an action that would've been impossible without all the academic research into computing and networking systems in the last few decades. I'd argue that the economic fallout of that research alone has more than paid back whatever money the US government has invested in universities.",1329622077

I'd love to hear about them, but have never actually seen a system like that. Even if there was though, before you go yanking money out of the system, you should actually try to replace it. And that will take time and money, and you will have to convince great scientists to make the switch, in spite of the fact that they will probably have less money, less resources, and spend more time doing something other than interesting research in order to build said system. That's all <i>really</i> hard.<p>Recently a lot of academics have been pushing for open journals, even going so far as to boycott closed ones. Even this is fairly controversial. :(<p><pre><code>  > Sure, but the university system isn't sold that way.

I don't believe I've ever met a professor who thought that all, or even most research, is life-changing, or even very interesting. I just don't buy that you heard that from a reliable source.<p><pre><code>  > Universities have special privileges when it comes to fostering immigration.\n  > If America had world-class research centers with the same privileges,\n  > people would still love to come here and they'd be able to do so.\n</code></pre>\nIt's not only about privilege: schools are known by foreigners as a system that allows them to get to the US. In order for this transition to be effective, you'd have to supplant the educational system, then get everyone to know about your alternative system.<p>And besides that, the institutions that do the hiring are incredibly biased towards American schools. I work for a reasonably prestigious lab, and the people in charge are (charitably put) deeply suspicious of research from Chinese and Indian schools. When given a choice, they will hire a PhD from an American school almost always. Exceptions include University College at London, Oxford, Cambridge, Utrecht, etc., but it is a vanishingly small list, and even they I would say are much less likely to be hired.<p><pre><code>  > As you point out, universities aren't very good at this.

Science is still pretty much a communal affair, and the mere availability of knowledge does not make science happen. You need a robust social framework to evolve it.

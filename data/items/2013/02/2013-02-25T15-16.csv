Hence skyrocketing obesity.<p>Eating a low-carb diet and easing off grains (particularly ""white"" grains) and sugars will help you lose weight. From the article I linked above: ""On the very low-carbohydrate diet, Dr. Ludwigs subjects expended 300 more calories a day than they did on the low-fat diet and 150 calories more than on the low-glycemic-index diet. As Dr. Ludwig explained, when the subjects were eating low-fat diets, theyd have to add an hour of moderate-intensity physical activity each day to expend as much energy as they would effortlessly on the very-low-carb diet. And this while consuming the same amount of calories.""<p>I can also speak from personal experience: I went gluten-free after being diagnosed with gluten intolerance in 2009. In three weeks, I effortlessly shed 12 pounds--12 pounds that had refused to come off previously no matter how much exercise I was doing or how religiously I tracked my caloric intake. I wasn't doing gluten-free to lose weight; I got dragged into it by a diagnosis, so this was a wholly unexpected yet awesome side benefit.<p>I've since noticed that if I slide back into eating too many carbs and sugars (even gluten-free ones), I start to gain weight again, and I feel groggy and disoriented. As a side effect of this diet^Wlifestyle change, I've also completely been able to drop caffeine consumption--something I never expected. Put simply, I didn't feel like I had been hit by a train when I woke up. Caffeine and energy drink consumption has spiked right along with ""low-fat"", high-carb diets.

5279493,comment,5278949,5278949,19,0,nirvana,,,"TL;DR: Here's the thing: All engineering is ""working remotely"" because being ""remote"" is simply a matter of isolation. This is why even people in the same room use headphones, IM, etc.  Everything that's not working remotely (eg: isolation) is ""meetings"" and the overhead of distractions.  The only advantage of having engineers in the same office is a lower cost of meetings. The disadvantage is it makes engineering harder.<p>--<p>This decision shows me that Meyer doesn't respect or understand engineering culture.  She's bought into the management BS ""accidental collaboration"" rationalization for industrial age butts-in-seats ideology.<p>Engineering culture comes, to a great degree, from the way you treat engineers and the process of engineering.<p>Treating engineers like cubicle bunnies who just can't wait to get interrupted by their Pointy Haired Boss is not conducive to building a good engineering culture.<p>In fact, requiring people to be in the office shows an anti-engineering mentality, because engineering, an effort of the mind, requires situations that are best for the mind.<p>Two key things enable good engineering: Collaboration (which requires communication) and coherent thought (which requires silence or peace or the isolation from interruption necessary to do it.)<p>This means that even if every engineer is in the same room, they're going to start ""working remotely"" by isolating each other via the use of headphones, and a preference for non-interruptive working (Eg: send email, or an IM rather than walk over and tap the engineer on the shoulder.)<p>It's true that in an office getting together in a conference room to has something out is easier and more convenient, but the tradeoff is that even with all the isolation people try to put into effect interruption creep is a real thing- eg: meetings, etc.<p>Working remotely prevents these interruptions at the slight cost of a higher level of effort needed to have a ""meeting"" (using a virtual whiteboard or just a phone call or whatever.)<p>So, if you spend most of your time in meetings, then you need everyone together.<p>If you value engineering and spend most of your time engineering, then whether people are together or apart physically, they are all isolating each other and effectively ""Working remotely"".<p>IM, Email and other collaboration tools that allow engineer isolation work as well whether the engineer is in the office or across the country.<p>Plus, lets not forget the minimum 2 hours of lost productivity that comes form requiring people to go to an office- either the commute (and the resulting need to get into work)-or the long lunches at those free cafeterias, and the endless cycle of distractions that are accepted non-work in offices.  A ""15 minute coffee break"" at the office really has a 20-40 minute work interruption, because it often involves other people, while that same break working remotely can easily be exactly 15 minutes, and likely will be shorter because 10 minutes is enough to get the same level of relaxation from the day.<p>Almost everything in an office is designed to distract you from engineering, and the cost of this overhead is significant.",1361807581

If you throw a coin, and the coin is flying in the air, what is the probability that it lands heads? By your reasoning, the motion is already in place, and it's either going to land heads or it isn't. With a high speed camera and some physics we might even be able to predict which side it will fall. Even if we go back to a little before you threw the coin, the electrons in your brain are already in place and it's already determined which way you'll throw the coin. Would it be invalid to say that there is a 50% chance that it will land heads? So even when we are talking about the future, we use probability to quantify our belief. Or perhaps more accurately, we use it to quantify our lack of knowledge: in this case our lack of knowledge about how exactly the coin will move. Since we are already using probability not just for ""fundamental randomness"" but for quantifying lack of knowledge about the future, what's so special about the future vs the past? It makes total sense to apply the same reasoning to the past, even if we are talking about a specific instance.",1361807552

If they admit pain in the area you are targeting, ask them what they are currently doing (your biggest competitor may be that they aren't doing anything).  Then subtly try to talk them out of the problem being a pain.  If you can't talk them out of it, it is indeed a pain point they want solved.<p>Once you have 30 look at your interview summaries, determine if you have validated or invalidated the assumption.

    for (/* stuff */) {
      // swap x and y on each iteration
      int t = x;
      x = y;
      y = t;
      // do stuff with x and y
    }
  }
</code></pre>
This is a situation where the code does a swap, and the register allocator can't optimize it away (without unrolling the loop). But we can use the XOR swap trick to swap x and y in place, without using a third register, which may make another register available which can live across loop iterations.<p><pre><code>  x ^= y
  y ^= x
  x ^= y

and we're done. No third register needed.<p>Of course, this is a really low-level trick useful in certain register allocation algorithms, not something that normal users should write in a high-level language.",1361807011

If you don't, then you do.<p>That's pretty condescending. If I don't share your view then I don't understand the situation?<p>I do prefer working from home but I perfectly understand the disadvantages, and I understand the advantages of working in an office. That doesn't mean that they weigh out to the same preference for me as they do for you.<p>> Firstly, working from an office doesn't not exclude a flexible work schedule.<p>You can have a flexible work schedule while working in an office, but that does undermine the major reason companies usually want people to work in an office; being accessible. If you're not there while other people are there you might as well not be there at all. In fact, if you are remote but working the same hours as your coworkers, you are <i>more</i> accessible than someone who is working in the same building but at different times.<p>> As far as not being bothered, this can certainly be true. This is actually part of the reason why I often wear headphones. Noise-cancelling headphones do a pretty good job of filtering out a lot of noise but just the act of wearing headphones I tend to find acts as a psychological barrier from others bothering you.<p>Again, if you're going to make yourself more isolated and inaccessible, why work in an office to begin with? You're citing reasons you should be working from home rather than reasons why working at an office is advantageous.<p>> The other issue, and this particularly applies to large companies, is one of culture. Culture like team cohesion is orders of magnitude easier to spread when physically colocated. For a company the size of Google (my employer), IMHO this is far more important than any individual perceived benefits about permanent remote work.<p>There are plenty of companies who work in person that either have toxic or no real culture. OTOH, there are plenty of companies that work remotely that have a great culture. You can do plenty while working remotely to spread culture; it's either there in everything the company does or it's missing.<p>There's nothing special about working from an office w/regards to culture, especially when personnel are working random hours and wearing headphones to isolate themselves.<p>> Also, I disagree with the position that this ""punishes"" good employees.<p>Well, you're wrong, and this goes far beyond working remotely or not. If you hire somebody with a given benefit -- whether that's the opportunity to work remotely, free cafeteria, health care, paid overtime, etc. -- and then you take that benefit away, that's punishing your employees. There's no two bits about it. Whether you personally would take advantage of that benefit or not does not matter. It is punishing the people who <i>did</i> take advantage of it, and that's simple fact.",1361806269

5279328,comment,5278039,5278039,26,0,tokenadult,,,"Wow. That was well worth a read, at whatever reading speed gives you full comprehension. The author did a good job of reading the previous scientific literature on the subject, and relating important issues to one another. He examined both historical claims (supposed world records of reading speed) and scientific claims (statements about how people read in general).<p>I read quite a few books about speed-reading when I was a university student in the early 1970s, putting the techniques to the test while taking courses in linguistics, foreign languages, history of technology, and Japanese literature in English translation. There are a number of good books about how to improve reading skills, with various levels of credulity about ""speed-reading"" claims. After my own research and experience, I have to agree with the paragraphs in the article submitted here based on more recent research:<p>""Ronald Carver, author of the 1990 book <i>The Causes of High and Low Reading Achievement,</i> is one researcher who has done extensive testing of readers and reading speed, and thoroughly examined the various speed reading techniques and the actual improvement likely to be gained. One notable test he did pitted four groups of the fastest readers he could find against each other. The groups consisted of champion speed readers, fast college readers, successful professionals whose jobs required a lot of reading, and students who had scored highest on speed reading tests. Carver found that of his superstars, none could read faster than 600 words per minute with more than 75% retention of information.<p>""Keith Rayner is a professor at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst and has studied this for a long time too. In fact, one of his papers is titled 'Eye movements in reading and information processing: 20 years of research,' and he published that in 1993. Rayner has found that 95% of college level readers test between 200 and 400 words per minute, with the average right around 300. Very few people can read faster than 400 words per minute, and any gain would likely come with an unacceptable loss of comprehension.""<p>I figure that my comfortable, steady reading speed in materials on a wide variety of subjects at an upper-division undergraduate to graduate school level is about 500 words per minute, with good comprehension. I plainly don't need ""tl;dr"" summaries of articles submitted to HN as often as many HN participants ask for those. (To be sure, many HN participants read English as a second language, and we should admire people who come here to participate in a second language, something very few Americans could do in a non-English-language online community.) I definitely read more slowly and with less comprehension on the first pass in Chinese or in German, my two strongest languages for second-language reading, but I have read whole books in both of those languages for fun or for research. I have diminishing ability to read other languages that are mentioned in my user profile here.<p>tl;dr: Don't worry about fancy eye movements too much, and don't worry about subvocalization too much. Just read steadily and think about what you are reading while you are reading it for best memory of what you read and best comprehension of what the author was trying to say. Building up your vocabulary--by more reading, of course--is the best way to build up your reading speed.<p>AFTER EDIT: The claim in another subthread here is specifically WRONG that Chinese constitutes any kind of proof about subvocalization. I'm not committing to a position on whether or not subvocalization, as defined by throat muscle movements, always occurs in reading, but I know from the books <i>Visible Speech</i> by John DeFrancis (a scholar of Chinese)<p><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Visible-Speech-Asian-Interactions-Comparisons/dp/0824812077"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Visible-Speech-Asian-Interactions-Comp...</a><p>and <i>Reading in the Brain: The Science and Evolution of a Human Invention</i> by Stanislas Dehaene (a neuroscientist who does brain imaging studies)<p><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Reading-Brain-Science-Evolution-Invention/dp/B003H4RAOU/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Reading-Brain-Science-Evolution-Invent...</a><p>and from my own study of four different Sinitic modern languages (Mandarin, Cantonese, Taiwanese, and Hakka) that all writing systems, properly so called, are systems for writing out speech. Writing is based on speech everywhere in the world and the Chinese writing system is full of clues that most written characters are based on the SOUND of spoken morphemes.<p>How you might write the conversation<p>""Does he know how to speak Mandarin?<p>""No, he doesn't.""<p><p><p>in Modern Standard Chinese characters contrasts with how you would write<p>""Does he know how to speak Cantonese?<p>""No, he doesn't.""<p><p><p>in the Chinese characters used to write Cantonese. As will readily appear even to readers who don't know Chinese characters, many more words than ""Mandarin"" and ""Cantonese"" differ between those sentences in Chinese characters.",1361805823

EasyMotion and Surround.vim are the only two real attempts I know of. EasyMotion gets by on marks while surround.vim is baroque.<p>* There's little/no context awareness built into the syntax highlighting/grammar files. Textmate's scope stuff is really the best feature of the editor. If the vim maintainers/community could decide on syntax groupings and a query system was added it'd be doable but I'm not really expecting it.<p>* There's limited context awareness built into the mapping system. ST's system is quite nice here.<p>* No support for multiple cursors. The support that's built into ST is fairly primitive compared to the multicusor whitepapers from MIT (I believe around 2000) which did generic editing stuff.<p>* No repl. This goes against the philosophy of the editor but having a repl is really convenient when doing lisps. Foreplay is sufficient but doesn't fill me with joy.<p>* I've wanted to set up what I call 'regions' in the file where one part of the file is a computed version of another. The obvious use case is xml tags where editing one tag name in the pair updates the other but I think it could be generic. I had more use cases when I was thinking about it but they're not coming to mind at the moment.<p>I think there is potential for interesting display/visualization stuff for the HTML based editors and integration into the runtime like Smalltalk environments. I'd also like to see some sort of AST manipulation server pop up and to provide IDE-like services in a cross-editor manner. Finally, I spent time with LEO in the early 2000s and while I hated the editing, the text node organization was interesting and I haven't seen a similar attempt elsewhere.<p>Don't get me wrong, there ARE new things in Vim that are unique/cool like conceal and I can do fun/weird stuff with UltiSnips which I haven't been able to do with other snippet systems.

The losers of the war were the anti-fascist resistance, who were crushed all over the world. Either they were massacred like in Greece or South Korea, or just crushed like in Italy and France. That's the winners and losers. That tells you partly what the war was about.<p>Now let's take the Cold War: Who's cheering and who's depressed? Let's take the East first. The people who are cheering are the former Communist Party bureaucracy who are now the capitalist entrepreneurs, rich beyond their wildest dreams, linked to Western capital, as in the traditional Third World model, and the new Mafia. They won the Cold War. The people of East Europe obviously lost the Cold War; they did succeed in overthrowing Soviet tyranny, which is a gain, but beyond that they've lost - they're in miserable shape and declining further. If you move to the West, who won and who lost? Well, the investors in General Motors certainly won. They now have this new Third World open again to exploitation - and they can use it against their own working classes. On the other hand, the workers in General Motors certainly didn't win, they lost. They lost the Cold War, because now there's another way to exploit them and oppress them and they're suffering from it.</i><p>-- Forum with John Pilger and Harold Pinter in Islington, London, May 1994",1361805290

Hiring someone who's likely to leave in 6 months is counter productive for a large company, and puzzles is one way to keep you away.<p>You'd have to ask someone who was at Facebooks and Googles in their early days and see if the hiring was based on puzzles. I suspect in those times a lot of decisions were made in much similar ways to how you'd want to do it now.

Let me tell you in no uncertain terms that Yahoo was the worst company I worked for.<p>I had very little work to do.  Period.  End of statement.  I spent most of my time doing practically nothing except playing ping pong and foosball and getting paid for it.  A lot of my coworkers and a lot of Yahoos were in the same boat.  Needless to say, that once the Microsoft acquisition failed and the layoffs started happening, most of us were out of there.<p>On top of that, there was very much a prima donna attitude around Yahoo, with a great deal of self-entitlement.  I remember a couple of threads on devel-random complaining about the lack of ping pong balls, and how that insulted us as Yahoos since it meant that management didn't trust us.  Oh the humanity of not providing everyone with $2 worth of ping pong balls!<p>Yahoo was filled with lazy workers, and an extremely fat layer of lazy management.  I vaguely remember Rasmus running a script that calculated around 70 employees per VP.  As well, the internal politics at Yahoo was astounding.  One of my friends worked on an iPhone app on his own free time, and when he tried to get approval, it was held up for months because people were arguing over things like color schemes, and which group should own the app.  It was pathetic.<p>I like what Marisa Mayer is doing.  I think by getting rid of some privileges like remote working, it is enforcing a discipline that hasn't been at Yahoo, at least during the years that I was there.  Showing up to work is a small price to pay for being paid a great wage and having the opportunity to work for what will hopefully become a first class company again.  People need to show up and work and interact with their peers, instead of hiding at home and people not knowing wtf is going on with them.  Sure, some people will quit, but quite bluntly, anyone worth their salt would have already left Yahoo by now.  Anyone who is happy working in the environment that was Yahoo over the past 5 years is not an A player by any stretch, so it's safe to assume that you can afford to lose them.",1361804920

Relearning to See is in big part about relearning to skip, like animals do, when they constantly move their eyes and heads to scan the environment or an object. And speedreading was at odds with this, because it emphasized you should fix your vision on some center point in the page and allow your peripheral vision to gobble up the surrounding text, and you need not even do it sequentially, you should get to the point where you ""understand"" the image of the page as a whole.

I also don't have any knowledge about any of this other than what I come across on the internet. My current company doesn't have a set WFH policy, it varies by department and sometimes seems hypocritical when you realize that there are overseas contractors. This is my disclaimer.<p>I disagree with this post. From everything that I understand from what I've read it seems like one of the major issues at Yahoo is a culture thing. This doesn't seem so much like a trust thing to me. It comes across to me as a way to rebuild an identity by changing the environment and you can't control the environment when people don't come in to the office.<p>It does seem to me like there is potential to lose some good employees up front, for sure. I don't assume this decision is a short term move. Whenever management makes a decision that is more restrictive, or against popular opinion, there is always out lash. Then it dies down. New people start and it's the only thing they know so it's not a big deal.<p>The people are going to be the ones who change the company, and to change their mindsets, and reinvigorate them it seems like a culture change would be a good thing in the long run. The current policy clearly isn't working, how bad could this really be?<p>I love the idea of working from home, being independent and working autonomously, but it has its place. It's situational at best and this might be the perfect example of a place where it's not currently working. This by no means is saying that it doesn't work for 37 Signals. It seems to work fantastically for them and for many of the customers who use their software. I loved Rework, and I'm definitely looking forward to Remote.<p>Not everything is black and white.",1361804693

The days I go into the office for meetings are the days I get nothing real done.<p>It seems like you've drawn a particular conclusion from this, but I think you are missing an entirely different one. If you ""don't get anything done"" every time you come in to the office, that would suggest there is something more important than your individual ""getting things done"" that doesn't get addressed when you aren't in the office. When you are there, taking advantage of the opportunity to address this exceeds the value of what I'm sure most people would describe as your primary job function.<p>> Here and in all the remote-working threads people come along to say it doesn't work and that you need to sit together to be a team. Well, I guess these are inexperienced people who haven't worked out how to do it effectively is all.<p>I would agree with this. Obviously remote working can work. That isn't to say that there aren't trade offs. There absolutely are. Like all trade offs, the exchange is a bargain for some contexts and an unacceptable price for others.",1361804638

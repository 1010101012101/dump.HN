They are advertised as get wasted as much as possible cause its cool.

I like listening to poster presentations given by USA-ians. Or very introductory talks about upcoming research projects.<p>However, once these talks are longer than, say, 15 minutes, I often feel that it is too exaggerated, too much focused on selling rather than trying to convey a deeper understanding of their research. I don't feel taken seriously as a listener; I feel as if the whole talk becomes an argument of authority. Then again, it is mostly a feeling and, when talking to the presenters afterwards, they are nice and knowledgeable and uncertain and all that. It seems more of a cultural difference really. In that respect I prefer listening to English (Great-Brittanish to count in those from Ireland, Sctoland) speakers. As a European, I feel I better connect with their stories than with those of USA-ians.<p>Still, presenting in English is hard for most of us who don't speak that language fluently. Speaking in public is hard in itself, but trying to convey your message in a tongue that isn't your own is frustratingly difficult. Personally I lack a basic English vocabulary as I learned the language later in life focusing on scientific and professional literature. I often find myself able to string more difficult words into a reasonable English sentence, whereas I am unable to explain it in plain words. Especially when talking or making conversation.

3801637,comment,3799487,3801567,2,0,wisty,,,"Yes, fortran is actually faster than C for some things. OK, C++ with the right templates, or a later C standard can theoretically do what Fortran does (remind me again - pass by reference, no recursion, and bounded arrays rather than pointers?). And Intel tends to be faster than gcc.<p>There's no way you can make broad statements (like ""nothing will beat C"" or ""fortran is actually faster than C for numerical stuff"") without having a few exceptions. Actually, Pypy is faster than C, in <i>extremely</i> specific circumstances (i.e. ones which were set up by the Pypy people to show off, see ""PyPy faster than C on a carefully crafted example"" ... thought they point out there are things you could do in C to make it win).<p>The most bang for you buck in JITs is for dynamic languages, because while stuff like type inference can exponentially explode, you'll only really have 1 type in many cases (i.e. a float), and the JIT can pick that up. And getting Python within an order of magnitude of C would be a massive win.",1333609958

The problem with blacklists is it's inevitable that bad sites will slip through the cracks.<p>DNS solves the UI problem: the inability of humans to easily remember IP addresses.<p>As I mentioned in another comment, DNS isn't the problem, it's the allocation of domain names. If squatters and spammers couldn't register domains so easily and cheaply it wouldn't be a problem.",1209257824

174571,comment,174101,174563,0,0,plinkplonk,,,"""I've heard that India is not really low cost anymore.""<p>This is not completely true. If you are trying to outsource to <i>companies</i>, sure it is getting more expensive all the time. They have to pay legions of useless managers / ""process control"" (think ISO 9000) people from the money the programmers earn.<p><i>If you have interesting work</i>, you can get good programmers at 25-50 $/hr. You could get  work done on a  fixed fee basis as well (which is what I would reccomend). 10 - 20 k$ would get you a <i>lot</i> of code (assuming you found good people in the first place).<p>A lot of people would like to work from home on decent projects vs being at the mercy of the outsourcing companies where you have little control over what technology/projects you work on. The sheer size of the country's outsourcing industry obscures the fact that there are a lot of good programmers who would want to work on more flexible terms, <i>especially</i> for startups. In that sense, India is still very much unexplored territory.",1209256882

I was hoping we could talk, so drop me a email if you are interested. Email's in my profile.<p>Oh! And thanks for posting this question.

174559,comment,174522,174522,0,0,raju,,,"Interesting article. I share the author's sentiments to a large extent. I was born in India, but moved to Nigeria when I was 4 months old as my dad worked there. After having spent 15 years there, I moved back to India, for a total of 7 years, and have already spent more time in the US than in India.<p>I have no family in the US, and occasionally do think of my family back in India and wonder if I am doing the right thing. I don't think of it as a ""price"" per se, since I don't regret coming to the US, but having led a such a ""nomadic"" existence for so long takes its toll. You leave behind social ties, the comfort of your surroundings, friends...<p>And you start a whole new life everytime you move. Further, I think it changes you as a person. I have noticed that as I  have gotten older (and consequently the more times I have moved :D) I have chosen to live a slightly more ""hermit"" existence. My group of friends has grown smaller and smaller, and I don't mind it so much. Maybe because in the back of my head I fear that its pointless.<p>I apologize if I went totally off track, but somehow, this article resonated with me (at some level)",1209255115

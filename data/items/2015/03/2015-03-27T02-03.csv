Be specific.<p>Virtual all arable land is already cultivated and grazable pasture is cowburnt now with population 7B. The notion that it&#x27;s not a problem to scale up because we can just keep chopping down rainforests for lumber, soy and palm oil plantations etc is sickening. No, agriculture doesn&#x27;t need wilderness, but the inhabitants of earth do.<p>> I&#x27;ll repeat what I said to the other guy: you first.<p>I have << 2.1 children; I&#x27;ve done my part.<p>> In fact, virtually every advanced society is either population-neutral or actually losing people.<p>So what? The rest of the world is churning out babies and are more than eager to move. Overpopulation is a global problem. Arithmetic again. Mathematically and physically of course population growth will end at some point. But it&#x27;s the major driver of all the major social, environmental, and political problems facing nations and the earth today, and it&#x27;s the easiest one to do something about.<p>Do you think that population growth just slowed down by magic? In developed countries, family planning is universally accessible. In developing countries where overpopulation is most acute, countries with well-run organized population programs like Thailand, Iran, and China have been extremely successful at managing population growth and have reaped the benefits.",1427425041

In Manhattan, I would love to be able to ride a citibike crosstown in mid town.  Both stations are full in the middle of the day.  If I take a bike out of the dock on the east side, I should get a credit, and I should pay money when I dock it at a busy station on the west side.

Learn how to make things. Start now, and never stop. Learn how to use technology to the fullest, both software and hardware. Learn how to write, speak and communicate ideas as effectively as possible. Learn how to hack people and understand how social structures work. Take that seriously. Most importantly, don&#x27;t let anyone change who you are. Choose a path and follow it doggedly.&quot;<p>Ironically, some of the best advice I&#x27;ve seen came from a book: &quot;Who you will be in five years is determined by who you meet today and what you read today&quot; [0]. But a 14 year old doesn&#x27;t need to read a whole book to gain that particular pearl of wisdom, or many of the others. I read a lot now, several of the books mentioned on this thread and many others. But that&#x27;s because I&#x27;m old, and it&#x27;s too late for me.

It looks to me like you&#x27;re trying to tell everyone that they have a moral duty to design systems in particular ways. That&#x27;s well and good, another design principle for all of us to observe. But you also write that you got a patent on an idea or method of how to actually implement that design principle. It makes it seem like you&#x27;ve got a profit motive for prescribing the design principle: you&#x27;ve got a patent on the way to implement that principle.

Making the mice feel attracted to cat urine is actually not that farfetched when you stop to think about it and notice that its just a matter of &quot;flipping a bit&quot; somewhere in the wiring.

It turns out that B-trees <i>are</i> on the optimal read/write tradeoff curve, but they are in a very bad corner.<p>B-trees cost O(log_B N) to read or write.<p>Fractal trees cost O(log_B N) to read, and O((log_B N)/sqrt(N)) to write (for the case where epsilon=2).<p>The hidden constants inside the big-Oh are small; they seem to be less than 2 in practice.  In fact, in the benchmarks that I&#x27;ve seen, the constants are in favor of the fractal tree.  I suspect that this is because the block size in practical B-trees is too small, so the seek time is large compared to the transfer time on magnetic disk.  Furthermore small block sizes hurt compression,  small block sizes make the tree deeper.  Furthermore, dynamic B-trees (ones that can be written) typically fill their blocks only about 3/4 full on average, making the effective block size even smaller.   In most dynamic B-trees, the block size is 4KB or 16KB.  In a few it&#x27;s 32KB or even 64KB.  For read-only databases I&#x27;ve seen people use 1MB blocks for B-trees.  In the fractal tree, the effective block size is 4MB, and I suspect that&#x27;s where we&#x27;re winning on the constants.<p>So for a constant slowdown in read performance (a quite small constant slowdown, or possibly a small speedup) you can get dramatic speedups on write performance.<p>LSM trees are not on the optimal tradeoff curve.  They suffer worse read perforamance that B-trees or Fractal trees, and their write performance is theoretically comparable to that of fractal trees.<p>So there&#x27;s an error in that drawing, but the drawing is conceptual anyway, since there&#x27;s no scale.  The point of the drawing is that fractal trees dominate LSM trees, and for about the same cost as a B-tree on reads, you can get much better write performance.  So the drawing is correct in spirit.<p>It makes no sense to build an LSM tree out of fractal trees. The resulting data structure would still be slower than a fractal tree.  It&#x27;s also unlikely to be faster than a B-tree-based LSM, since the B-trees used in LSM trees are static, not dynamic.  You never have to insert into one of those B-trees, which means you can apply a bunch of tricks, such as using huge blocks. That probably shifts the constant inside the big-Oh back in favor of the B-tree for read operations, which are the only B-tree operations inside an LSM.<p>I don&#x27;t think Tokutek is conflating the theoretical performance with the practical performance.  Both the theoretical and practical performance appear to be better than the alternatives. In practice fractal trees appear to be slightly faster than B-trees at reads (assuming that the B-tree is actually a writeable data structure) in real workloads, and much faster at writes.  In theory, the asymptotic read performance is the same, and the asymptotic write performance is much better for Fractal Trees.<p>It&#x27;s true that the LSM implementations could all be bad, leading to the wrong conclusion when doing benchmarking.  I&#x27;d find that surprising because the fractal tree seems to be better than any of the many LSM implementations in practice, and I&#x27;d hope that at least one of them would get it right.  And the practical performance matches what the theory says it should, so it&#x27;s not surprising that the fractal trees are faster.<p>I&#x27;m not sure why you object to comparing the data structures.  We can compare them both theoretically using big-Oh notation.  We can also do an analysis for specific database sizes and memory sizes of how the data structures compare, assuming a good implementation.  That&#x27;s what my paper tried to do.  We could also compare the implementations, which  my paper didn&#x27;t do, but which others have done.  For example, Tim Callaghan has done a lot of benchmarking which seems to be done right.",1427421746

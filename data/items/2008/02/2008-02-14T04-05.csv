I wish I slept more actually - I really sometimes do feel like I am brain damaging myself.

During that time the group tries to identify all the people that need to be in the planning meetings.<p>I actually worked in a place that developed software this way. The smallest of projects would take over 8 months. Large projects would take close to 5 years.<p>Any project that took over 1 year was likely to get canceled. The budget would usually look different the following year, the business priorities would shift or the technology stack would be obsolete.<p>I was in meetings over 90% of the time.

Suppose A and B were meeting and each was supposed to mimic the other within a finite duration T. Since there must be a deal, somebody needs to initiate the action, triggering all subsequent mimicry. I suppose the starter could be arbitrary. Assume very perfect mimicry... what would result?<p>Perhaps it would be some kind of ""purified,"" or ""meta"" form of salespersonhood; then, both would notice the intense recursion in each other, yet try to keep a straight face. The deal goes through as planned; everything seems pretty, but both are exhausted beyond belief.<p>Just an interpretation out of my own amusement.",1202963699

Arguably, Microsoft wastes the most potential because many millions of instances of Microsoft software repeatedly waste a few minutes of people's lives.<p>The difference is that Microsoft is able to externalise almost all risk and accountability. The same principles of ""defect management"" are applied to aerospace hardware and Microsoft software. The only difference is the acceptable threshold for bugs. For the space shuttle, bugs are minimised until the budget is exhausted. For Microsoft, bugs are minimised until it costs less to to say ""Oh, heck. Just ship it.""",1202962667

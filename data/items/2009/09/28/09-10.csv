848136,comment,847627,848011,0,0,dagw,,,"Assuming the people faking these sort of numbers aren't complete morons they'll know that this sort of naive statistical test is the first thing people will try.  Thus they'll probably run their simulation and then manually poke a few of the numbers to make sure that this sort of test fails.<p>Also If they're slightly smarter still they'll realize that the chance of getting a question right or wrong is not independent.  You're chance of someone getting questions 5-10 right is probably quite closely correlated to whether or not they got questions 1-4 right.<p>Anyway my basic point is that assuming the person in charge of writing a simulation didn't sleep through all of statistics 101 it is quite trivial to write a simple simulation that won't be detected by simple statistical analysis.",1254131792

How an individual actually ends up being able to perform and actually performs is accidental to a high degree. The overall societal effect of this mass of arbitrary performers is a very complex phenomenon. To really study that we should look to the field of systems theory.

9518610,comment,9516824,9516963,0,0,pbsd,,,"This technique is quite old, actually, and has historically been used to compress RSA keys. It is perfectly safe, provided you don&#x27;t have access to the original modulus (the intuition here is that if p is chosen uniformly at random, then next_prime(n/p) will also be (almost) uniformly distributed). Other techniques exist that permit to embed information about d or p inside the modulus (e.g. [7]), but those don&#x27;t apply in this case.<p>The first appearance of this technique was in [1, §2.1]. Later, Vanstone and Zucherato reinvented and also tried to patent it [2, 3]. Lenstra also joined in [4]. Bernstein and Coppersmith suggested a method, based on lattice reduction, that reduces RSA keys to up to 1/3 of their size [5]. Joye [6] describes a method achieving this without <i>explicitly</i> using lattice reduction.<p>[1] <a href=""http://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007%2F3-540-46877-3_42"" rel=""nofollow"">http://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007%2F3-540-46877-3_42</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF00190758"" rel=""nofollow"">http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF00190758</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://patents.justia.com/patent/6134325"" rel=""nofollow"">http://patents.justia.com/patent/6134325</a><p>[4] <a href=""http://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007%2F3-540-49649-1_1"" rel=""nofollow"">http://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007%2F3-540-49649-1_1</a><p>[5] <a href=""http://cr.yp.to/sigs/key.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://cr.yp.to/sigs/key.html</a><p>[6] <a href=""http://joye.site88.net/papers/Joy08rsacompr.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://joye.site88.net/papers/Joy08rsacompr.pdf</a><p>[7] <a href=""https://eprint.iacr.org/2002/183"" rel=""nofollow"">https://eprint.iacr.org/2002/183</a>",1431226774

9518599,comment,9516217,9518120,0,0,FullyFunctional,,,"Reduceron, which I try to maintain, is written in York Lava.  It has a module for writing sequential logic (called Recipe) and while it makes sequential logic way easier, I have been working on an alternative for a while.<p>I completely agree that the sequential parts of a design <i>is</i> the challenging (= bug prone) part and IMO this is the area where an EDSL like Lava can really shine.<p>If you have worked in ASIC designs that you are almost certainly used to not work with Verilog directly, but with an ad-hoc macro language.  I&#x27;ve seen them all, but most commonly Perl is used.  It is especially for circuits that we desperately need better tools and abstractions.<p>When designing with Lava you aren&#x27;t describing a circuit, but a the method to create that circuit.  That makes it relatively trivial to completely parametrize it or statically check properties of the circuit.<p>As an example, if done right (Recipe isn&#x27;t), adding a pipeline stage can be a matter of adding a single line.  Compare that to what it takes in say Verilog.<p>This style of ASIC development is simply incomparable to the primitive Verilog-style, but there&#x27;s not enough experience in the industry to understand it [yet].<p>Now, Clash isn&#x27;t (IIUC) an EDSL like Lava so without knowing more about it, I fear it looses much of the point.<p>EDIT: formatting",1431226466

[0]<p>Quick math...<p>&quot;In 2013, 153 early-stage funds in the US raised US$9.4 billion&quot; Going with the mean (even though median is better) suggests the average fund is ~$60 million.  Let&#x27;s say that a firm runs 2 concurrently.  2013 was a boom year, so let&#x27;s say the last fund was $40.  So it&#x27;s 100mm under management.  They keep 2% of funds under management, and get 20% carry.  Let&#x27;s say that the funds appreciate 10% a year (we&#x27;re talking mean - it may actually be lower).  That means 2% of 100m = $2mm in management fees and 20% of 20% of 10% of 100m = $2mm in carry.  (I&#x27;m ignoring compounding, but let&#x27;s let that slide)  The firm has $4mm to pay rent, fancy trips, business dinners and nice salaries.  If the firm invests the $100mm in 20 deals, perhaps it needs 5 partners (4 boards per partner?) and 5 associates.  Let&#x27;s call the fixed overhead a half million dollars?  That leaves $3.5 million - perhaps each partner takes home $500K and each associate $200K?  Or $600K per partner and $100K per associate?<p>My informal intuition is that the top partners do much better, while most folks do a little worse.  We&#x27;re also in a boom time now because great investments are being harvested, and lots of money is entering the sector.  Net - they&#x27;re doing good in both carry and management fees.<p>This may sound a lot, but generally the private equity folks earn more.<p>[0] <a href=""http://www.forbes.com/profile/john-doerr/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.forbes.com/profile/john-doerr/</a>\n[1] <a href=""http://www.ey.com/Publication/vwLUAssets/EY-venture-capital-insights-2013-year-end/$FILE/EY-venture-capital-insights-2013-year-end.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.ey.com/Publication/vwLUAssets/EY-venture-capital-...</a>",1431226062

I like to play a game of &quot;connections&quot; (a la James Burke) and learn about things by unfolding knowledge.<p>Take something familiar like amazon.com.<p>- It&#x27;s an on-line department store<p>- department stores were designed to consolidate various shopping venues under one roof<p>- Sears was an early department store<p>- they launched their stores to cater to working classes and farmers outside of city centers and in concert with their catalog business<p>- their catalogs were common in rural general stores<p>- general stores used them to expand the merchandise they could offer to rural customers<p>- rural customers frequented general stores to pick up items they couldn&#x27;t manufacture on their farms<p>- they came into the town where the general stores were to sell the stuff they grew on their farms<p>- towns sprung up along major navigation routes: roads, rail, rivers and canals<p>- before roads and rail, there were rivers and canals<p>- rivers are hard to reliably use to move commodities from rural areas to market<p>- canals offered a more controlled environment to move commodities to market<p>- once canals were established goods could easily move both ways<p>- this made it more convenient to live in rural areas<p>- early canals were fed by gravity, tapping into nearby rivers for water, this operated the locks and gates<p>- an investor and promoter of canals was George Washington<p>- George Washington, other than being a General and President was a businessman<p>- Among his business ventures he invested in farming, whisky, canals, tobacco, horse breeding, weaving (a diversified portfolio)<p>- one of his investments was the C&O canal<p>- the C&O canal reached Harpers Ferry in 1833 and connected it with Washington D.C.<p>- Harpers Ferry was named after Quaker Colonist Robert Harper and the ferry service he established<p>- It&#x27;s at the confluence of the Potomac and and Shenandoah rivers<p>- Before the industrial revolution and steam power, it was used as a military manufacturing center and the rivers powered manufacturing equipment used to carve wood and metal into guns<p>- Equipment used to manufacture weapons were standardized and the invention of interchangeable parts was pioneered there by Captain John Hall between 1820 and 1840 establishing patterns used later in the industrial revolution and gives us today everything from Cars to iPhones<p>Each one of these things can be chased off into different directions and the game of Connections can continue. Along the way you can learn about mechanical engineering, hydrolic power, logistics, commercial models, and so on as the web of connections grows out and grows more complex.<p>Suddenly you&#x27;ll start to fill in knowledge gaps in other areas, frontier life, colonization, labor saving devices, information transmission, etc. You&#x27;ll start to understand motivations and first principals behind the modern world. The &quot;why?&quot; behind things. Before too long you&#x27;ll be able to make seamless connections up-down and across time. The whole of human history will start to take on a vividness it doesn&#x27;t from just reading a linear textbook.<p>Even better, at particularly interesting stopping points, you can probably go visit those places and see those things yourself and continue to unfold knowledge and ideas.<p>Imagine my surprise when I saw how much of ancient Rome was built out of brick and not marble, and the implications that arise from an industry built around supplying brick to the ancient empire and not quarrying marble! Or seeing Roman concrete in the Pantheon and then climbing the Duomo in Florence and seeing Brunelleschi overcoming a thousand years of ignorance and figuring out how to build a dome again -- and then climbing other domes and seeing Brunelleschi&#x27;s idea repeated over and over again for centuries. Or seeing the Mosque of Muhammad Ali in Cairo, built from Pyramid stone and adorned with a French clock, and then going to Paris and seeing the Luxor Obelisk at the Place de la Condorde in Paris and thinking through the problem of that exchange in detail (it was like a brain explosion for me). Or walking the restored fortifications at Rhodes and understanding how difficult the approach by the Ottomans was, and then seeing Malta right after and learning about the Knights of Saint John. Or seeing Hadrian&#x27;s Arch in Athens, Hadrian&#x27;s Wall in the U.K, Castel Sant&#x27;Angelo in Rome and so many statues of Hadrian that you realize you can recognize him by sight, 2,000 years after his death, from across the room in Washington D.C. Or visiting Dasan&#x27;s grave in South Korea, and then seeing the fortifications at Hwaseong Fortress and then realizing he was Catholic and reading about Christianity in Korea and finding out it started in China!<p>The world is a mindblowing place full of problems that so many smart people throughout history have tried all kinds of interesting ways to solve. I find I&#x27;m often inspired and in awe at what those who have come before us have solved, in far more primitive times and without any of the means we have available to us today. It puts in perspective things we still struggle with today, and connects me to people and their thoughts from thousands of years ago.

Code reviews are usually between peers so you shouldn&#x27;t be afraid to seek out clarification where possible. You shouldn&#x27;t be making edits to code that goes in production without clearly understanding why.<p>The other thing that wasn&#x27;t mentioned, that I think is important, is to not act as a blocker for code reviews unless its absolutely necessary. Lots of engineers take on the attitude that they&#x27;re going to &quot;gate&quot; code they don&#x27;t agree with by with holding their +1 and bogging down the review with questions and all sorts of runarounds till its what they want. this is a bad attitude to have, even when you&#x27;re dealing with Junior engineers.<p>I&#x27;m generally going to +1 something unless I fundamentally disagree with it or think its going to break things in production. What I do, though, is leave lots of comments with questions/suggestions and mention it in the +1 with (see comments).<p>This builds trust on teams, and stops things getting personal, especially with people who aren&#x27;t very good at dealing with criticism, even in something as banal as a CR. On a team that works well together, teammates will see those comments, think about them and make thoughtful responses, especially once they understand that you&#x27;re not trying to get in their way. Giving the +1 gives them the freedom to consider your suggestions without being irritated that their PR is being blocked. They feel like they&#x27;re in control not you.<p>In rare exceptions, someone will brush off my questions and merge ... which means that next time, I get to be tougher on the review and specifically ask for responses before the code can be merged, because they&#x27;ve degraded the implicit team trust.

1673657,story,,,1,0,praecipula,"Cost of artisanal development",,"I had an interesting discussion with a co-worker about food the other day, and it sparked a train of thought:<p>If you were opening a restaurant (and actually care about food - let's leave fast food out of this one), you essentially have two segments of the market to target: there's the mass-market, who just need lunch during the workday, or who just need a dinner and don't want to cook, and there's the artisanal non-chain approach where enjoying the food is the attraction. It's an event.<p>The train of thought went like this: I love to cook, and when I do, I do it for the enjoyment of preparing and eating the food. There's not a lot of satisfaction in just fulfilling my daily calorie requirements. This is just the way I work. If you take the time to cook, why not do it right? Now, in my career, I want to do the same with software, but there _is no_ artisanal market for software. Open source is a way for people to enjoy other peoples' work, but there's no market for consumers of open source software itself (consulting aside). Every job I've had working for someone else is much more like the just-make-some-mac'n'cheez variety, where there's no satisfaction in it - because consumers of software don't really care about software (the code itself, mind you) in the way that they care about food. If it works, it's good enough.<p>Now, the question is this: much of the struggle in a budding company is to hit product-market fit, right? A startup product is an ever-changing product, where things are born and die on a daily basis. So how does one manage to balance a good quality product with having to hustle your product?",1283983014

1673650,comment,1671772,1672516,0,0,agentultra,,,"Thank you for the honest reply. I was hoping someone who uses these techniques in their hiring process would explain what they find so useful about it.<p>I've hired many programmers before myself and I've never used such a rigorous process. I'm just curious why it has become so popular, There's got to be a reason, right?<p><i>You have just self-identified your bad attitude. If you think this is ""draconian and insulting"", just wait until your knee deep in digital shit with customers barking at you all day long.</i><p>Actually my bad attitude has left me with a list of references from customers and managers who'd be happy to tell you that they've been satisfied with my work. Some of them are my best evangelists.<p>What I find insulting is ignorance. In my original comment I mention that it's the rigidity with which the process is enforced which is insulting. I think it's ignorant of the interviewer to not bother reading a candidates' source code when they offer it (the same for their website, etc). You validate that by saying that it doesn't matter what code a candidate has written prior to the interview. That is exactly the ignorance I have a problem with.<p>I suspect that if the goal of this process is to understand what a person's attitude, knowledge, skills and such are really like then reading their source code and blog posts would be the first step in getting to know them.<p><i>I don't care what you've done before, your state of mind, or even if your code ever runs or compiles. If you're any good at all, I'll find out. If you're a poser, I'll find that out, too. And if you don't want to play along, then either you're a poser avoiding exposure or a prima donna who is saving me a lot of suffering down the road.</i><p>I find that reading someone's commit history in a project can be very illuminating. The logs alone can give you a sense of their commitment to a project, what kind of work they prefer, and even a cursory glance at their skill level (are they fixing small bugs, introducing bugs, reverting a lot?). If you have time to sit down and read a few patches you can certainly see how well they follow coding conventions, whether they understand control and data structures, and perhaps even algorithms if that's what you're looking for. You can learn a lot from the code a person writes.<p>What I was having a hard time understanding is what kind of things can white-board (or pencil and paper) problems tell you. After reading your other comments, I think I have an idea. You want to know if they can talk freely about time vs space constraints, optimization, basic control structures, and data structures. You want to know if they know the fundamentals. I can appreciate that.<p>What I still don't understand about your process is how the candidates' previous code contributions and experiences do not matter. Can you not get the answers you seek from reading their code? If it wasn't just Joe Programmer but Larry Wall or Peter Norvig, would that change your opinion?<p>I just don't think it's a universally applicable tool, but I find many companies that seem to think it is the <i>only</i> way to screen candidates. I think that some flexibility is necessary because you're dealing with human beings. The hiring process isn't an exact science IMO. Just like Agile isn't the ONE TRUE WAY to develop software I don't think you'll find a single process that will find you the best employees.",1283982810

In fact, I think it could easily be argued that in the absence of additional data, it would actually constitute a reason <i>not</i> to trust the programmer's competence.<p>While I fully agree that trade offs like yours do occur in our profession, their mere existence is no argument against my initial non-trust of 37signals' competence: you need to actually demonstrate that this problem <i>is</i> one of those cases, and I think that would be difficult to do.<p>The problem of associating entities in a way that their associations can be modified easily and consistently (i.e., normalization) is effectively a solved problem.

You can't tell how many calories are in a food by looking at it.  You CAN tell how large a waistband is with a ruler.  Legislating on this would make things <i>very</i> difficult on both clothing manufacturers and clothing purchasers.  And it's only misleading to people who don't own a ruler, which I think is a fair burden to place on the consumer.",1283980810

1673524,comment,1671869,1673188,0,0,korch,,,"<i>The Net interprets censorship as damage and routes around it.</i><p>Incidentally, many of the communities on these under the radar, non-Craigslist sites are now bracing for the equivalent of the <i>Eternal September</i>, like when AOL opened up access to Usenet and an ocean of newbies destroyed the careful equilibrium of a community which the general public mostly didn't know even existed. I worked for one of the bigger sites(in the top 5), and let me tell you, the amount of traffic they all get, the number of users and the number of women posting would absolutely shock folks. <i>The entire online prostitution industry is much, much bigger than everyone realizes.</i> It's just all under the radar, and for good reason!<p>Craigslist has always been the AOL of the industry, as the lowest hanging fruit, with the most blatant crime, spam, cops and worst behaved prostitutes. But at the same time, their traffic amounts were a high multiple of everyone else combined. All the AGs have accomplished is to redirect hundreds of thousands of posts and millions of hits elsewhere on the Internet. :P<p>The AGs surely must be grand-standing, or else I am vastly underestimating their intelligence and understanding of how the Internet works. They surely know damned well they stand no chance of going after the dozens upon dozens of other sites out there, wrangling each one through the courts, and shutting each down one by one. All it will take is one legal fuck up in one case against one site that gets thrown out or won to set the precedent, then the flood gates open and we're all back to where we started: the general public has a fundamental base level of protected free speech online, and online prostitution continues as it always has.<p>Also, the AGs have just made the jobs of the cops infinitely harder to go after prostitution. This is actually a law enforcement disaster—when you can't stop all the crime, the next best hope is that you can at least have an evidence trail for the worst crimes that you must go after. It's a triage system, as applied to law enforcement. Now the cops don't even have that. Before, with CL being the hub, the cops make one phone call and get IPs, credit cards, and post history—it was a nearly automated process that would shock most people how easy it was. Now, as the user base fractures amongst sites all over the world, the cops are going to have a much harder, less user-friendly way of getting any investigative information. So when some criminal fool posts on some board that they have a basement full of 12 year old Eastern European girls chained to the wall, or whatever extravagent crime you want to imagine, the cops won't be able to hit the ground running after one phone call. It could take weeks just to locate where the poster originated. 
Nice job AGs!<p>Not to mention that when women can't easily post online, their next best alternative is to work as <i>street walkers</i>, and that is a public safety disaster. You could even argue that in the past decade Craigslist has <i>helped</i> society by moving prostitution off the streets and onto the web.<p>Besides, many of the big sites are not even hosted nor incorporated in the US and are quite untouchable.<p>Basically it all boils down to this:<p><i>AGs: it's an election year, we need to drum up PR, sex & prostitution moves our political base, so it cannot possibly backfire, it's illegal, it has all moved to the Internet, so let's stop the Internet!</i><p><i>Internet: lol wut?!</i>",1283980488

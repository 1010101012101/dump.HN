192675,comment,192654,192654,0,0,Alex3917,,,"I think part of the problem for me is having gone through public school. When you're 13, sneaking out of the lunch room to read Slashdot in the library is literally the most productive thing you could be doing during that time period. Even in high school I would have learned more by reading Reddit, had it existed, than by doing most of the homework I was assigned. The basic issue is that when you're in school you're basically forcibly prevented from doing anything productive, so the best possible outcome is to try to learn something. But at that age, when you're still young and don't know that much, you can actually learn more from surfing the web than from anything that goes on in the classroom. (School did so much to suck the joy out of reading that reading was simply out of the question for a good five year chunk of my life.)<p>I think the real issue is learning to realize when A) you now have the freedom to do productive things, so surfing the web is no longer a good use of your time and B) you've outgrown a given discourse group and hanging out with a certain crowd is no longer a productive use of your time. But for some reason internalizing these things is a really difficult thing to do.",1211039985

I'd like to be able to get at the websites I own and the core documentation at least. I feel like you could co-opt some of these child-safe browsing tools to only let you on to the sites that were necessary for work. Maybe this could be the next step for rescuetime--only let me on to sites that I said were productive.",1211039680

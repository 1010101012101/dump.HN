I call it ""reading a movie"" and it works best for: fiction, computer stuff, and to a lesser extend where I already have some knowledge.  It also works when I'm not tired.  When I start 'reading words' (your wife's inner narrator), I have to give up and stop for a while.  When reading new and difficult stuff I'll usually read each chunk[1] twice, once for the words and once for the picture. This seems to be the best.  I do notice that I have an above average reading retention in my peer group, but at a conceptual level. I am absolutely terrible at quoting, since the ideas are transferred, not words.<p>Does the your experience match mine?<p>[1] The groupings can be a couple sentences or a couple of paragraphs per chunk, depending on how unfamiliar I am with the topic.",1249948740

Technically I guess the client app issues a request for user input which is served by the X server. To extend that model the X server issues a sub-request to the user who fulfils that request. To me this seems to twist the terminology to the point where the user is just another service available to the program.

754317,comment,753879,754200,0,0,pasbesoin,,,"I need to look further, but so far it appears to me that when one chooses in a browser to view the certificate chain of a secure page, where that secure page references secure content from/using third party domains/certificates, only the certificate chain of the top level page is displayed.  The other certificate chains involved are essentially hidden unless one views the page source or runs a traffic sniffer.  Is that correct?<p>If so, I'd prefer an option to see all the certificate chains involved in loading a page's content.  Maybe most users won't care, but some will, and it would keep those details from remaining hidden or difficult/time consuming to access.<p>Somewhat related to this, I continue to be somewhat frustrated at the amount of dialog navigation that is required to view certificate chains in some browsers (e.g. Firefox 3 made the chain viewing dialog deeper nested within a hierarchy of dialog navigation).<p>My perspective is that, even when users don't fully understand an item, they are good at noticing changes -- we're wired to do so.  If the chain is easily accessed, and users are taught to give it a glance, they are likely to notice if/when it changes, particularly for regularly visited sites.  They may not know exactly what is going on, but it would likely be enough to inject caution and a google (twitter, whatever) for answers.",1249947496

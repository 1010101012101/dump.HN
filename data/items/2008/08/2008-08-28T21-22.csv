But it is also hard to recruit people to grow your company -- especially businesspeople -- in a bubble economy where every company with a domain name is going public with billion-dollar valuations. So ArsDigita tried to come up with a plan to go public, and that inevitably involved VCs, because back then investment banks didn't bother talking to privately funded companies, because the fix was in: Why bother working with actual, profitable companies when you can make more money by scratching a VC's back? It's not like the market was paying attention to fundamentals at the time.<p>The moral of this story is that bubbles suck. They're completely disorienting: The market value of everything is screwed up, and you're surrounded by irrational people. I do not miss those days at all.",1219960689

289528,comment,289520,289520,0,0,cperciva,,,"Aside from the problem discussed in the article of squishing people by accelerating them at hundreds of g, there's a more fundamental problem with a ""launch X into orbit by shooting it very fast"" approach: Trajectory.  An object in freefall (which your ballistics are once they leave your gun / catapult / linear accelerator / etc) with a bounded trajectory (i.e., doesn't escape Earth's gravity entirely) travels in an elliptical path.  If one point on that path is on the earth's surface... well, there's 3 more points on the earth's surface, too.<p>In order to reach orbit, you MUST add angular momentum.  And until we have a space elevator, that means rockets.",1219960597

289501,comment,289412,289493,0,0,tstegart,,,"They don't control the apps, but they control their networks. Your theory only works if money can be made even when these fancy applications are being used. If a carrier loses money when people start using these apps (for example, maybe a VIOP app) on their smartphones, there is no incentive to be competitive. They'll just get rid of you as a customer, and no other carrier will want you or your smartphone on their network. So getting rid of you would actually be an advantage.<p>Now, common public perception is that carriers actually make a ton of money and that they could allow these apps and still make money (I think this is true, actually). But that doesn't mean that carrier concerns won't play into the equation. In all seriousness, Steve Jobs didn't make up those categories Apple wouldn't allow in the App Store out of thin air, they are all carrier concerns.<p>So why would a carrier want to allow massive amounts of Android phones using massive amounts of data, not paying for big voice plans and slowing down their network? I think a better reality is that either the carriers will block your fancy app on their network, or they'll charge you extra for all the data and whatnot those fancy apps will use. So yes, you can develop a more open app, but using it is another matter.",1219958319

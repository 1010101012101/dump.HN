Some European film critics held this view until recently.<p>I recall one of Finland's former leading critics, a man who used to teach cinema history in the country's leading film school, listing his favorite films of all time in 1996, when the art form turned 100. His list included a single color film, and he made special note of that: ""This film demonstrates that it's possible to create a film where color is not a distraction but an essential element.""",1272620845

What he's doing while his car is parked will vary, but he is expected to pay the same amount at the meter per unit time regardless of how worthwhile being parked there is to him at any point in time. In the same way, an employee is paid for seat time. The service he provides to his employer may vary depending on what the employer has him doing, but he expects the same remuneration regardless.<p>I suspect by your confusion, you see the same misunderstanding as I do. The relationship chain does not stop with his employer; instead it recurses out one or more levels from there until it reaches a customer paying for the product. <i>This</i> is where the value of the work is realized, when you find the person who will purchase the good or service on behalf of <i>themselves</i>, rather than on behalf of someone else further up the chain. More often that not, this last person in the chain will end up paying based on something other than time. If this customer refuses to pay more than employer is paying for your time, you are not productive enough, regardless of what sort of sense of entitlement to employment you think your diligence and hard work provide for you. You cost more than you produce; thanks for playing.<p>If you generate enough value for the actual customer that your employer is happy with the cut they get, then it absolutely should not matter how many hours you put in to generate that value.<p>It really comes down to a question of which is more important in being an employee: the value you produce for your employers customers; or how well you demonstrate your willingness to work hard, be a team player, demonstrate a strong work ethic, be diligent and obedient to the chain of command, or any of a myraid other things that <i>might</i> increase the value you produce to your customers, but are not the same thing <i>as</i> producing value to your customers.<p>The market is brutal; it couldn't care less how pious and moral you are.",1272619322

Does this mean Apple and Microsoft know, or believe, that Flash will soon support VP8?",1272618576

Now permutate this machine-generated ""social"" information with all the tools springing up to analyze tweets and derive all kinds of useful crowd-sourced insights. It all becomes that much more diluted with less and less information actually created by a live, thinking human being. This might be the start of a trend - tools which tweet automatically based on incoming tweets, creating that feared endless loop which you <i>cannot</i> detect because you only control one participant.

In those cases, the original products often get shut down a few months before the rebranded version is released.

To be blunt, while Win7 has made many strides towards being a better touch OS it is no where near where it needs to be yet for someone to use it without a mouse and keyboard. There is just too much heavy lifting left to do.<p>I see this less as ""we where never intending to do this,"" and more ""we have something infinitely better, in house, which is actually built from the ground up for touch controls.

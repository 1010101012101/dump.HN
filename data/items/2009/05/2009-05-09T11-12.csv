Of course, not everyone I worked for was an idiot, but enough of them poisoned my daily life that I thought I would do better without them. I did.<p>Now I start companies to ""do stuff that matters"" and all the ideas I have had just don't seem to fit into a regular company. I find it easier to create something new and attract investors than to find the right company to support me doing what needs to get done.",1241870335

They probably just want it shut down because they don't want to invest the time and energy to determine whether or not the app is more beneficial than not.<p>However, I have found that it is quite easy to convince a university administration to listen to your concerns when you engage them positively.   I would ask to schedule a meeting with the Chancellor (or someone who would have the power to overturn the decision) and give a positive, optimistic presentation on how the service could reduce the load on the registration system and how you would be willing to work with them to ensure that it will have minimal impact on the service.   You might be surprised how seriously they will take your proposal.",1241870200

I'm not entirely happy with either part of this, although it's more the fault of the back end and all its legacy c++ issues.  I'd consider switching to nginx on the front end if I could be sure it wasn't going to interfere with our e-mail setup.<p>Personal server: thttpd.  It could log cgi scripts better.  Otherwise I'm happy with it.<p>Laptops: thttpd, sending all requests for localhost to a cgi script.  If I could persuade it to log cgi errors, it would be perfect.",1241867205

The purpose of the copyright was to ultimately create a richer culture, and to do that they needed artists to create works of art, but once they do that, the period of time for which they own the copyright should be optimized for ""minimization"" not maximization, so the society at large can benefit from them.<p>Copyiright was designed to ultimately help the society.

I was planning on rewriting it or cutting it up and then appending it as a reply to each of the responses I got but I don't want to spam out this board and I don't want to go over everything again. Also sorry for responding so much later. I both love and hate getting into internet arguments. It always makes me anxious and stuff.. Anyway..<p>So your main concern is that I said that an unreasonable person would be someone who takes personal experience as evidence. My answer to that is two fold. First I have already said that the types of claims you and your wife are referring to do merit the same status as out of body experiences. That those claims are not testable and that I don't really know how it relates to evidence. So there you go. I do know that the brain is very malliable and that the way the brain experiences things are not exactly clear cut to us at this point. <a href=""http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2011/09/wiring_the_brain"" rel=""nofollow"">http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2011/09/wiring_the_brain</a> So while I wouldn't take things that you might have experienced to be evidence for God I don't think that you or people like you are unreasonable. Your type of experience however is not what I was talking about when I first broght this up. I'm talking about the people who hear the house settling and they think it is Ghosts. (I wasn't talking about you when I said this or later when I was giving an example of a falsifiable theory.) Or the presidental canidate who thinks the hurricane is a message to politicians. I was talking about how absurd it is to think that there is a majority group of Christians out there who want to rationally talk about their beliefs and in any way have them challenged. That point and your other point that groups that do terrible things are not Christians are the two main things that I disagree with you. Christians that do terrible things are still Christians just like atheists who do terrible things are still atheists too. In fact, alien worshippers could also be considered atheist. I use the term atheist to mean skeptical freethinker. I think you use the term Christian to mean true Christian. That there is actually additional criteria that you are applying to the term that wasn't there before. Otherwise, what, we would have to rewrite every single history book about every single unenlightened group? Christians are generally a wonderful group of people, especially those that actually know a thing or two about the Bible. I'm not and would never say the opposite. I just think that the crazies also fall under the same banner.<p>@Dove<p>""I don't know"" is a perfectly good and, best of all, honest answer to some of the questions we have today. I'm almost certian you are of the belief that we can't understand God fully right? So I don't see why not knowing something is such a terrible thing. I am of the opinion that the evidence will lead you away from sources that claim to know about the unknowable especially when those sources need to rely on threats of eternal punishment. I imagine that terrible business might influence some thinkers like Pascal but if you stick to the evidence, the story will be different. As far as atheistic belief relying on vain things and Christians beliefing things despite riticule: the last I heard is that the statistic is like 93% of people believe in God. Is it also the case that atheists are still the most hated group in America? Either way, peer pressure doesn't work that way. If you want pride you will find it on any side of any argument, just as you will find smarmy repugnent a-holes, and complete idiots. I'm sorry that you seem to have had many bad encounters. All I can say is that it seems like it is easy to become embittered on the internet by all of the rampent inflamatory crap on here. Sorry.",1316015765

Sure, iteration means making quick <i>tactical</i> decisions and conclusions, but business is about <i>strategy</i> and that often moves on the scale of months (even in lean startup land).

2996695,comment,2995671,2995671,3,0,Chris_Newton,,,"I think some of this debate is slightly missing a key point: tables are for showing precise data, but graphics are for showing <i>patterns</i>. If you're expecting your viewer to read accurate values off a chart, you're probably using the wrong tool for the job. If you're trying to use the same chart type to show different kinds of pattern in the same underlying data, you're probably having a ""when all you have is a hammer, everything looks like a nail"" problem.<p>I do agree that pie charts are overused and there is often a better alternative, but do stacked sausage charts really do much better when it comes to showing differences between roughly similar values? Here's an example:<p><a href=""http://imgur.com/zGuwg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://imgur.com/zGuwg</a><p>Sure, it's obvious which red bars are longest on the left-hand side, because <i>they have a common edge</i>. But in that case, it's not really the length of the bars that the viewer is comparing, it's the position of the right-hand end, just like a simple bar chart.<p>As soon as you stack thing up, so you're trying to compare sections that don't align at either end such as the green or orange bars here, it is still difficult to see which ones are longer. Something more drastic, such as reversing the order of the bars completely, throws off any comparison, as with the second and fifth lines.<p>I don't see how a series of sausage charts like this is much better than a series of pie charts if your goal is to allow your viewer to compare the sizes of each category across the series. You need to get the key values onto the same scale to do that effectively, and I would expect a better choice to be something like a multi-bar chart (with the same zero level for each bar, either grouping all categories for each point in the series or isolating each category in a chart of its own) or perhaps some sort of overlapping line chart if the gradients are interesting.",1316015508

2996681,comment,2994029,2994029,1,0,elehack,,,"I've been watching AeroFS for a few months now, and it is a fascinating product that almost meets my needs.  Just a few things keep me from using it, some of which I can't quite put my finger on enough to turn in to real feature requests on UserVoice.<p>- It crashes sometimes. I think it does this less frequently now, but its favorite time to crash is when I suspend & resume my laptop.<p>- Synchronization is a difficult problem to solve, and users need to have confidence that the software Does It Right.  Somehow Dropbox achieves this, and I can't put my finger on how; I think part of it is the fact that conflicting files are duplicated and clearly marked.  I haven't had conflicting syncs yet with AeroFS, so I'm not sure how it handles them, but I also haven't seen documentation on what happens.  It's a combination of an algorithmic problem, which you presumably have solved, and a UI problem to demonstrate to the user that their data is safe and correct.<p>- It doesn't yet support ignores. There's a feature request for this, and I've upvoted it, so hopefully it's just a matter of time. When I'm syncing a source directory, I don't want the built files synced. Yes, there's version control, but it's really convenient to sync portions of my Eclipse workspace so I can transparently work on the same changes on both my laptop and workstation.<p>- I don't know how it works.  There are two pieces of this that are interesting to me: the network topology and the crypto design.  One of AeroFS's selling points is that your data is never shipped to the centralized cloud unless you explicitly use AeroFS cloud storage.  However, as a privacy-conscious user, I would like to know exactly where my data is going, when, and how it is protected.  Some data seems to be going to AeroFS's servers for coordination; what all data is?  File lists, or just peer locations & names of libraries?  A diagram what network connections are used and where data is shipped would help users such as myself understand where our data go and what the risk points are.  Hopefully this can be documented without jeopardizing your special sauce/value-add.  For the crypto side, it would be useful to know exactly what crypto algorithms are in use, where, and in what configurations.  Some providers claim Great Crypto, and then they're using Blowfish.  You've got some of this - your Features page discusses the use of the 2048-bit RSA keys.  But how is the ""secure channel"" established?  How are the RSA keys secured against theft (e.g. the Dropbox steal-the-auth-DB hack)?  The crypto documentation could be overlaid on the network infrastructure documentation.  In short - why should I believe the security claims?  With things like this, I think extensive transparency is the best way to engender trust with your users, particularly when your competition is criticized for transparency-related issues (e.g. the encryption ""misunderstanding"" with Dropbox).<p>I think AeroFS has a lot of promise, and I want you guys to succeed. We need some good, secure, strongly-privacy-preserving competition in the cloud file sync space.",1316015380

Certainly a crucial part of absorbing information is paying attention in the first place. Or understanding what we're seeing. On both of those counts, pie charts do a pretty quick and easy job for many hypothetical audiences.<p>Some of the graphs and charts offered up in this article as alternatives to pie charts would, quite frankly, confuse the heck out of a lot of audiences. And if your audience doesn't understand what it's seeing, it's not going to absorb the information. Furthermore, if it has to be <i>told</i> what it's seeing, then it's already in an unreceptive psychological state.<p>I would not advocate lying to an audience, or grossly misrepresenting data. But I certainly would keep two things in mind: 1) the data-sophistication of my audience, and 2) the attention span of my audience. A pie chart may not be terribly precise in its representation of data, but it's clearly, quickly, and almost universally recognized.<p>Perhaps there's also room for a compromise in any given presentation: a data overview slide, with simple pie charts and other ""30,000-foot"" graphs, followed by a more detailed breakdown of key measurements in more precise terms.

If I apply the Pomodoro method and set a fixed time for the break to start, I found that for me it's actually quite easy to get back onto the problem after the short break.<p>What I think makes the difference is that forcing the break, although annoying at first, makes you take the break when things are going well, resulting in eagerness to continue solving the problem after the break.   While, if you take a break when you feel you need one,  things are probably already stuck and it's harder to start up again.<p>I do agree with getting away from the computer for a proper break every few hours, but isn't that quite natural already?

In production I use an intermediary step where all of my templates are actually re-processed back into raw javascript strings and served inside my minified/compressed/cached js file. I use a central access point that knows to grab the templates from a javascript object namespace instead of the innerHTML of an id when not in DEBUG mode. So while it still technically uses javascript strings at the end of the day, that's not how I develop them. For the average developer that's just looking to get easier maintenance over javascript templates, script tags with ids is the way to go.<p>""Simple"" str1 + data + str2 might fly for a trivial one to two page website, but quickly devolves into an unmaintainable mess of spaghetti code as project sizes increase. I don't know of any modern programmer that would ever advocate for string concatenation over string interpolation via sprintf/templating/etc. I should also hope you're not trying to parse the strings yourself manually, regex'ing variables into it.

I've switched to Netbeans in the past (and back because of concerns at work--our build process hates Netbeans) and have been using IntelliJ for the last three months. Since switching to IntelliJ, I've never been happier when working in Java (would still prefer Visual Studio to any of this, though).<p>IMO, anyway, Eclipse's problem is that it doesn't feel like an IDE. It feels like a framework for making IDEs, and Java's sort of bolted in. The user experience is not good, and worse when using non-Java language. A lot of this can be chalked up to Eclipse being a very early example of this sort of IDE framework design, but there are a lot of warts that have just never been fixed.<p>It's just not a comfortable environment. Honestly it feels like the developers of the Java ecosystem atop Eclipse went ""eh, close enough"" at one point and it's stayed there for half a decade. It doesn't feel like anyone spent time looking at how users actually write code, but rather went off how <i>they</i> wrote code and extrapolated it to their userbase.",1316012791

Suppose you want the same lengthy template to be available across several pages which share the same JavaScript. Then it makes a lot more sense to put the template in the JS and serve it once than to put it in the DOM and serve it repeatedly. Also, with the DOM approach, you have to insert data into the template using regex rather than simple str1 + data + str2.<p>If syntax highlighting is really your major concern, write a simple script that compiles your .html to .coffee (sandwiched with """""").

Not just to the author, but some of the other comments here. Eclipse is probably one of the most sophisticated software development platforms out there.<p>Have you used the debugger (emulator or physical device)? How about the integration of DDMS into eclipse? FindBugs? HotSwaping? One IDE for python, php, java ... etc? Code profiling? The list is basically endless.<p>It is second nature to me, but its confusing how someone coming from xcode could rail against eclipse. Sure, I like using vim sometimes, but compare adding a plugin to eclipse to adding a plugin to vim. Compare the debug capabilities of eclipse to nearly every other debugger I've ever worked with. You can do instruction step by step debugging on a physical device! It integrates with your scm and you project management.<p>I really think Eclipse gets a bad rap from people who haven't used it since 2004 and base their entire analysis on what their experience was then. But to come to a modern version of Eclipse and compare it to XCode and find eclipse lacking ... i find that suspicious.<p>Edit: Full disclosure ...

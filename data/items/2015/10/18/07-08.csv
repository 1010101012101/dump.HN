That only works if the NIC can checksum the TCP packet content and update the header.<p>If the network card can do TCP segmentation offload, the kernel does not have to repeat this operation for each 1500 bytes packets, it can fetch a large amount of data from disk, and the NIC will split the data in smaller packets by itself.",1445154883

10407530,story,,,1,0,chasb,"Aptible is hiring senior site reliability engineers",,"Aptible is looking for a site reliability engineer to help build and run our platforms. Your job will include keeping our internal services running, improving our monitoring and incident response, running and automating service migrations and scaling, and feeding everything you learn on the front lines back into the development of our platform.<p>We&#x27;re a small team building a platform and a suite of compliance tools for digital health. Our platform is built around Docker on AWS. Our customers push source code and a Dockerfile to a git repo and our platform takes it from there: building, deploying, and running their image.<p>If you&#x27;re an SRE who&#x27;s looking to work on a smaller, ops-focused development team with a lot more impact and ownership, this is the job for you. If you&#x27;re not an SRE, you may also be a good fit for this position if you&#x27;ve enjoyed ops or sysadmin work in the past but want to write more automation code with modern tools like Chef and Docker on AWS. You&#x27;re probably also a good fit if you&#x27;re a developer who enjoys doing ops work and want to make the transition to shorter-term, higher-impact automation projects.<p>ABOUT US:<p>Aptible’s mission is to help our customers work safely with the most meaningful, sensitive data in highly regulated industries. To do this, we build devops tools that streamline information security compliance for web and mobile applications. We currently focus primarily in healthcare, on HIPAA compliance.<p>Our philosophy is that good engineering products and practices are the best competitive advantage for teams working in regulated technology. We build tools and provide services that help our customers gain those advantages. We serve all kinds of customers, from small dev teams to large business units of established companies.<p>We are backed by the best investors in tech, including Y Combinator (S14), Rock Health, Maverick and Lux Capital.<p>YOU ARE A GOOD FIT IF:<p>- You have extensive experience with AWS<p>- You are excited to work with Docker<p>- You have a professional background related to designing backend software systems<p>- You communicate well and work effectively with others<p>- You are comfortable with high degrees of freedom and responsibility<p>WHY WORK WITH US?<p>- <i>Engineering First:</i> Aptible is a tech company from the ground up. It’s founded by engineers, the team is predominantly engineers, and our users are all engineers. Your coworkers and customers will be some of the best in the world at what they do.<p>- <i>Independence & Trust:</i> Over time, you will be expected to function independently with minimal process overhead for significant portions of your work. This reinforces a high degree of mutual trust within our team.<p>- <i>Our Business Model:</i> We make money by charging our customers a monthly fee for software and services. This allows us to make decisions for the long term. We aren’t the type of startup where we give away everything for free in hopes that once we collect 100 PB of data we can build an AI to replace your doctor or sell pharma ads.<p>- <i>Our Customers:</i> We help the best companies in digital health solve their hardest engineering and regulatory problems. We involve them in our product development process and have a weekly support rotation in which the whole team participates. It’s a great way to learn firsthand the strongest and weakest points in the product.<p>- <i>Introspection:</i> Most of us have worked at a half-dozen companies or more. We’ve lived through best and worst practices in how to run teams. We value regular reflection on process (i.e., retrospectives) with constant small course corrections instead of bulk overhauls when things get really bad. We strive to make expectations clear and give regular, actionable feedback.<p>- <i>Professional Development:</i> In building our deployment platform, you’ll be solving new, hard problems at the bleeding edge of container coordination. If you believe that containers are the new paradigm, your work at Aptible will prepare you tremendously for the future. By helping our customers solve issues with their own open-source-based applications, you’ll quickly become an expert in many open-source frameworks and libraries.<p>- <i>OSS:</i> We believe in active participation in the open-source community on which we’re built. The majority of our GitHub repos are public. You will have the opportunity to create, maintain, and contribute to some of the most interesting projects in open-source.<p>- <i>Flexibility:</i> We are based in Brooklyn but our team is distributed across the country. As a senior engineer, you’ll have the freedom to work on your own schedule, from wherever you like. You’re always more than welcome at headquarters, and we will fly you in periodically for all-hands weeks.<p>- <i>Upside:</i> As an early employee, you’ll receive both competitive salary and meaningful equity in a company that’s growing fast. We think startups should give employees more stock, be more transparent about what percentage of the company that stock represents, and discuss what happens to that stock in various outcomes.<p>OTHER BENEFITS<p>- Full medical, dental and vision coverage — 100% of premiums for employees, 80% for dependent medical premiums, and 100% for dependent dental and vision premiums.<p>- Mandatory minimum vacation each year. Too often at startups, “unlimited vacation” means “no vacation.” We will force you to take time off. Our CEO will suspend your email and GitHub access if you don’t do it.<p>- Whatever computing setup you want.<p>Apply at <a href=""https://jobs.lever.co/aptible/cdc31a4d-e488-439d-96ff-898386bcdbdb/apply?lever-source=HackerNews"" rel=""nofollow"">https://jobs.lever.co/aptible/cdc31a4d-e488-439d-96ff-898386...</a>",1445154631

Many real world problems in the technology industries would never have existed if intellectual property laws could not be applied to restrict communication and compatibility. Allowing patents to effectively restrict the transfer of data, because the tools available to either or both parties effectively require patented formats or similar, is either a tax on communication or a tool for censorship, depending primarily on the willingness of the patent holder to licence on useful terms.<p>Ironically, the US actually got this right in the case of fonts and copyrights, in that while a specific program to describe a font might be subject to copyright, the design of the font itself is not. Thus unlike certain other creative industries, no-one can go around claiming royalties on every publication displayed in a sans serif font because it looks a bit similar to something from the early 1900s and (insert dubious legal argument about derivative works restarting the copyright clock here).",1445154278

OTOH, the tracks under the head are linear, so the same density improvement of factor n only causes a corresponding bandwidth increase of factor n.<p>And seek times are governed by physics and haven&#x27;t really improved much at all.

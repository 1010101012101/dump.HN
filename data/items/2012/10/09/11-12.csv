A driver who knows all the details of how each engine works will be able to choose the car that provides the best fuel economy and performance, but in the end, the driver's status will really only be judged on the style and features of the car they choose.<p>i.e. the developer who chooses the slower zeroarray algorithm that still completes in reasonable time, but provides a better user interface and better feature set is still the better software developer (but perhaps the poorer computer scientist).",1349783962

4631008,comment,4630912,4630912,2,0,lomegor,,,"Although I understand that you want something to run faster, preemptive optimization is not always the best solution. It can lead to bad code and to weird behaviour. For example, arrays and especially associative arrays should not go inside double quotes, most of the times (I'm not sure if it's even possible). That way, double quotes are only useful with single variables, meaning that sometimes, even with double quotes, you would need to use concatenation.<p>And that's not even taking into account sanitation, because with double quotes it's easier to avoid it, and harder to notice.<p>I prefer choosing one of those types of quotes and sticking to it throughout the code. It makes code more readable and makes it easier to notice bugs and optimization problems.",1349783833

I see lots of heavily indebted entrepreneurs in Europe taking on big personal risk, both financially and in terms of career risk. European entrepreneurs rely on bank loans much more than the typical U.S business. There's very little equity in many small businesses.<p>Enrepreneurs who are now wealthy often had to struggle for many years in poverty without much social security before they achieved that kind of success. Many fail as well. I think you're mixing up entrepreneurs and big corporations. Big corporations can absorb or avoid paying taxes in any particular country, but entrepreneurs often can't.<p>I do agree with you that monetary policy should be counter cyclical and it is. The ECB has tripled its balance sheet since 2007 and it has lowered interest rates to 0.75%, which is way below CPI. I agree that they should have been even more aggressive but there's a political reality as well.<p>Monetary policy is not the issue here. The problem is counter cyclical fiscal policy. It has to stand on both legs. If you don't run a surplus in boom times you're not going to be able to spend enough during downturns.<p>But our political systems seem to be structually pro cyclical.

I'm saying this is not a useful perspective because it only gets interesting when you can point out what kind of difference there is and why it is important, and then you end up with something that higher quality texts may have in common.<p>While critics may have some difficulty telling authors or texts apart because of human limitations, computers attain very high accuracies with various authorship attribution methods. This underscores my point: if you focus on differences, you will end up identifying very particular things such as a particular author or even the style of a particular work, that's just the idea taken to its extreme.<p>On the other hand, I believe that the quality of a work, which is one kind of value indeed, can lie in commonalities instead of differences.

4630934,comment,4629461,4630786,4,0,WildUtah,,,"Sure.<p>Suppose you write an app and put it on the Google app store (because who wants to publish on a phone that can't even produce a decent map?).<p>Now in a parallel universe, you first form a corporation to publish your app. Maybe you're hoping to establish a brand or get easier credit or take investors or keep accounting simpler when the business grows. For whatever reason, you incorporated the app business first and then published to the app store.<p>Your app is a big success and makes a million dollars, ninety-nine cents at a time.<p>Remember that in the original story, you wrote the app and published it yourself. In the parallel incorporated universe you wrote the app and published it yourself, but through a corporation in which you are the sole shareholder. Either way the writing act and the value delivered are the same and the money collected are the same.<p>The taxes won't be the same because sole proprietors (that's you alone running a business), partnerships (two or more people running a business without incorporating), and corporations are taxed differently. Those differences can be useful and beneficial or distortionary depending on circumstances. From a policy-making point of view we don't want the ultimate total tax liability to be very much higher or lower for any kind of organization. Well, we might want them to be different if we want to discourage one form of business organization, but then we might as well just make it illegal from the start.<p>So let's consider how much tax you pay on your app.<p>In the original plan, you pay personal tax rates up to 35% (39.6% next year) plus FICA (2.9% marginal, but half deductible against income and FICA itself(!)) and state income taxes (about 7% average).<p>You'll be left with about 57 cents from your marginal dollar.<p>In the corporate parallel, you pay 35% corporate rates plus state income tax (5% average). Then you pay yourself dividends or capital gains. Dividends can be converted to capital gains by dissolving the corporation or stock buy backs. The current capital gain rate is 15% federal plus state income tax (again).<p>You'll be left with 62 cents after corporate taxes (state taxes are deductible against corporate levies) and then 50 cents after personal taxes.<p>So the corporate route costs you about 7 cents per dollar in higher taxes. Raising the dividend or capital gains rate to the personal rate would leave you with 35 cents and make a total cost of 22 cents per dollar for choosing the corporate form.<p>The corporate form has some tax benefits that can justify part of the seven cent burden. There are benefit programs and deductions available more easily to corporations. They cannot make up anything like a 22 cent difference.<p>Charging tax rates so high on corporate profits will lead to tax dodges like hoarding profits inside the company, paying executives outrageous hidden tax-free beenfits, and using the corporate tax-free interest paid loophole to make things even worse from a tax and corporate integrity perspective.<p>Now the USA has the highest corporate income tax rate in the world (matched with Japan). Obama has proposed dropping that rate along with eliminating deductions to keep it revenue neutral. He also wants to raise capital gains and dividend taxes to 20% or possibly higher. That would be a good trade-off for everyone but it's important to remember that your choice of business organization should not make so much difference in your tax paid that it takes the decision from you.",1349781840

In contrast to things that appear within the normal client area as the often-spoofed yellowish notification bar of old Internet Explorer versions (the newer one at the bottom now sees this as well). I think Firefox opted for a very deliberate design in security-critical cases that will always appear from within the chrome and never overlay the page in a way that could be spoofed by clever CSS.<p>Of course, now with pages requesting to go fullscreen there isn't a browser UI anymore that could show things that cannot normally appear in the page content.

People have made efforts, earnest efforts, at solving the problem (dojo, ext, closure, capuccino). None have caught on and at the moment I'm assuming none will.<p>Bakground paragraph: I've been thinking about the issue since 2004 or so and always assumed that a widget toolkit would develop like it did for desktop environemnts and one or two would eventually win. The launch of mobile app development changed things. The kinds of apps being delivered were outright better than what equivalent web apps were delivering. Not the perf, I assume perf is going to be solved by better hardware and engine improvements, but what the apps accomplish. My conclusion is that every project has a semi-fixed budget of resources and that web developers burn roughly 50% of that budget on building a custom one-off interface solution for every project they work on. The obvious answer is components but component frameworks had not been catching on so the question is why.<p>The normally cited problem is the composition problem. It's incredibly difficult to achieve component isolation in the DOM and the Web Components effort is attempting to address. I approve the effort but I do not believe it will solve the problem. It's possible(ref yui3) to write components that will cleanly drop into pages that keep their CSS tweaks class based and that restriction isn't unreasonable in an app. Component use happens more frequently in apps but is not the default like it needs to be to escape the one-off tar pit. The issue is social.<p>The web's roots in documents mean that pretty much everybody wants a custom UI. All existing component libraries, following desktop toolit precedents, come as a packaged markup/CSS/behavior combo. These two requirements are opposed and that opposition is the core problem. I have never used a component library and not had to customize a signfiicant number of components. When doing so, I either have to maintain a private fork of the component or suffer in download/perf as the framework is super heavy and caters to all possibilities. The yui3 (and looks like current dojo) approach of core+plugin composition with auto dependency resolution is the best solution I know of but overriding is still non-trivial. Tweaking the CSS usually means having to build a complete theme and using generated markup is hit and miss.<p>My current thinking is that Web Components are a start but there needs to be a good solution for selectively overriding a part of the markup and for overriding style. CSS preprocessor features are also required to achieve styling goals efficiently. The rise of Bootstrap might prove me wrong by starting as an incomplete system, getting buy in (multiple themes, adoption for simple uses), and growing to a more complete one but we'll see.",1349781122

A surprisingly large number of users was fooled by that.<p>I guess the ""padlock means secure"" has been superceded a little by ""address bar is green somewhere"" by now, but the problem remains the same.",1349780529

I shouldn't have to worry about it when working at a higher level of abstraction.

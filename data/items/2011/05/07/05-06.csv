You describe it as ""the last bit"", when in terms of effort required it may reasonably be every bit as large a task as any other component of your project, and in terms of user impact it may be the largest part of your project.<p>A (not so relevant) example about understanding the cost of design work: a lot of people claim that they can't draw, but they may be saying ""my first sketch looked awful, therefore I can't draw"", I started programming with \n10 PRINT ""HI!"" \n20 GOTO 10\nbut didn't tell myself ""I can't write a defender clone, therefore I'll never be a programmer"", skills are developed through use and practice.<p>From a developer perspective ask yourself what role design plays in the architecture of your project, are you structuring things so that the design can be rev'd independently of the software - I often bounce between working on design side and programming side tasks while working (ADD at work), but that is only really practical if they are (de)coupled in a way that allows parallel development.",1304746573

Whether you get an IMAP server or Exchange, it's going to be cost prohibitive to host it yourself, so you'll have to pay a hosting company to manage it for you.  I don't see how that would be any different than Google hosting it, and it would be significantly more expensive.<p>In my experience supporting law firms, they all use Exchange hosted in their own rack on-site, but I've only worked with firms with 10+ attorneys.",1304746479

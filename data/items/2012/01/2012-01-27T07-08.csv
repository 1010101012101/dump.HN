3517515,comment,3515307,3515307,1,0,ninthfrank07,,,"I'm extremely interesting in applying for this summer. The only problem is that I'm still in Cegep (a two-year college for Quebec students before they go to university - I'm 17) and so if ever I get chosen, I still have one more year remaining to complete my program (International Baccalaureate in Pure & Applied Science).<p>I don't think I would drop it, because I ultimately intend to go in computer science at Stanford. Therefore, I would have to leave the Bay Area at the end of August in order to move back in Quebec and stay there during the year and come back in the summer when I'm finish my program.<p>I would still have time to work on my startup during the year, but at a much lower pace (2-3 hours each night and 8-12 hours on weekends). The other guy on my team (he's 17 too) is in a much less intensive program then me and he could continue working almost full-time on the startup.<p>But I'm the only one writing code. My co-founder (who's currently studying in Business Management) will be working on the marketing (posting on the blog, making videos showcasing the app, posters in schools and other places, talking with other companies so that they use our app, etc.) I also have a graphic designer that will not be directly involve in the startup but that will do my logo and help me design icons, textures, etc.<p>Without even knowing anything about my idea (I can tell you though that even if I'm the only technical founder, it's not an overwhelmingly complex app and I am confident that I could manage the coding alone. Our first goal is to get as much users as possible so I think it's appropriate that my co-founder will be more focusing on marketing the app), because really I don't want to be chosen for my idea but rather for my team (I've got this interesting idea that I want to work on, and I like it because I would actually use the app, and actually, Ive got a bunch of startup ideas (Im the kind of guy that always has tons of projects going on and new ideas in mind: I want to code apps, make movies and crazy edits, learn new monologues by heart, run marathons, travel around the world and learn new things!), but this particular one is not too complex to implement, yet if it turns out that I choose to do a completely different project, then so be it! Anyway, I dont think the idea I apply with matters that much (but it ought to be good obviously), because anybody could apply to YC with a similar idea and develop a similar app. But would they really be as much passionate as us about the app and as much caring about the users, would they achieve to convince companies of using it, would they convince people of using it? I know we would. My point is that Im expecting to be chosen a lot more because of my team than because of my idea. (If you're interested to know what my app is though, email me (frabrunelle@gmail.com) or skype with me (francisbrunelle)). Yet why do I want do be chosen? I want to build useful products and it thrills me that with the internet millions of people could be using them! But what thrills me even more is that if ever I do YC, I would be hanging around with dozens of other developers that are in the same situation as me. I want to discuss and debate about ideas with those developer. It would be an insanely great and enjoyable experience. And thats exactly why I want to do YC: for the experience.), do you think I have any chance of getting selected? Or should I wait for next summer, when I will have finish my program? The thing though is that I will still continue to go to school (Stanford, MIT, McGill or somewhere), so again I will have the same problem as the one I have right now.<p>I truly enjoy school but the real reason I want to go in c.s. at Stanford is to meet other c.s. students and start a startup with them. I'm also interested in studying in theatre, so I'm really not dropping school soon. But I don't want to wait after university to finally apply for YC, I feel ready now. The reason I want to go through YC is to meet interesting people, discuss ideas and because I'm sure it would be a tremendous experience. If I don't get chosen, I will still develop my app over the summer, but I just think YC is an outstanding opportunity and that I ought to at least submit an application. I will continue submitting applications every summer until I'm chosen.<p>P.S. As a developer, I'm not that skilled, but I always manage to figure things out by myself and find a way to do what I want. If I'm stuck, I don't easily give up. Nevertheless, I'm more of an idea guy. I'm currently following tutorials from <a href=""http://www.raywenderlich.com/store"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.raywenderlich.com/store</a> since December in order to get more familiar with the iOS 5 SDK. When I'll finish them, I'll look at the Parse SDK (<a href=""http://parse.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://parse.com</a>) and then at the Facebook iOS SDK (<a href=""https://developers.facebook.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://developers.facebook.com/</a>). I will then code an app similar to FML but it will be called ""You know you're in IB when..."", IB being the program I'm currently in. I will integrate the Parse SDK and the Facebook iOS SDK in this app. It's a simple app that I want to do for testing purposes and also because I know that my other classmates would actually use it and that motivates me a lot. I will then start working on the real app that I want to do for my startup. My goal is to have a working app with bare minimum features for the end of May so that I have something to show if ever I move to the Bay Area. I'm working toward this goal 2-3 hours everyday and 8-12 hours on weekends.",1327651034

I'm in the middle of the biography, and I hope to someday read one on Gates as well, but from what I've seen and read to date there was just more to talk about with Steve. He was charismatic and intense, yet somewhat tortured and insane. When people consider Bill Gates they definitely respect him and look up to him, but he's so laid back and humble that there's not much to talk about. He has a ton of money, he's sane, and he's pumping his cash into philanthropic goals that we won't see the effects of for years. I think people just prefer to talk about Steve because he was so vibrant (as Gates put it) and so you hear more about him, which you convert to people ""looking up to him.""<p>However this video bothered me, why was the interviewer picking at Jobs' time left to live?",1327650612

3517487,comment,3515845,3516767,3,0,antoncohen,,,"Well, .join(x) joins an array into a string, with x as the separator. First of all what does Array(16) make? Effectively it should make an array with null 16 times. Now, JavaScript seems to think null is a blank string, a string with the text 'null', or a zero depending on the context.<p>The first thing it should do is TypeError that null is not a string. Or don't join null fields because there is nothing there.<p>If is does convert null to '', then it should TypeError on string - int. If it is not going to TypeError it should do something sensible, like slice the string<p><pre><code>  > Array(16).join(""wat"".slice(0,-1)) + "" Batman!""
  'wawawawawawawawawawawawawawawa Batman!'
</code></pre>
I think the correct thing would be to TypeError in two different places. Or change the language so things that don't error actually work. Returning a string with NaNs in it will just lead to uncaught errors. If it actually returns something it should probably be ' Batman!'.<p>JavaScript nuttiness:<p>Now it's zero:<p><pre><code>  > null + 1
  1
</code></pre>
Now it's ""null"":<p><pre><code>  > null + ""text""
  'nulltext'
</code></pre>
Now it's a blank string:<p><pre><code>  > [null, null, null].join()
  ',,'
</code></pre>
Python errors when things don't make sense, and forces you to make them make sense:<p>If it doesn't work, error:<p><pre><code>  >>> ""wat"" - 1
  Traceback (most recent call last):
	  File ""<stdin>"", line 1, in <module>
  TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for -: 'str' and 'int'

Can't join None into a string:<p><pre><code>  >>> ','.join([None, None, None])
  Traceback (most recent call last):
	  File ""<stdin>"", line 1, in <module>

Convert None to a string if you want:<p><pre><code>  >>> ','.join([str(i) for i in [None, None, None]])
  'None,None,None'

more of a personal device.<p>3. From a pedagogical viewpoint, IMHO, i think younger kids should not
have a digital device 24x7 as they could possibly get ""addicted"" to it . 
It is more important to impart a sense of curiosity(scientific temper) & hunger for learning, & having an XO3 might hamper  kids' social activities - going outdoors & playing with other kids, being fit, taking part in sports.<p>So i feel younger kids could be exposed to low-cost computers( made of
a RPi) in school, which are low cost & encourage tinkering (open source, simple inexpensive hw) while older (say high school kids can get their own personal XO3.<p>#4.

And if you're unsure about if an idea is worth perusing, Steve is the right person to talk to[4].<p>Another reason why you're such good friends with Steve is that he is an animal lover and has promised that if you ever call on him to watch your dog because you just <i>need</i> to take a vacation for a weekend, he will watch your dog[5] for you.

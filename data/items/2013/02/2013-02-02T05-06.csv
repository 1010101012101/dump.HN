Your significant other moving, is _not a silly thing_.<p>> Ill let you in on a secret: most of our remote developers work longer hours than our in-office devs.<p>Yet another reason not to work remotely -- to maintain your work-life balance. Home is a place you spend with family and/or significant other, and doing non-work related stuff.<p>> it forces me to look at what theyve done<p>This is something you should always look at. Measuring someone's performance by the number of hours they've spent in the office is _never_ a good idea; some people are just productive than others.<p>I stopped reading at this point. The author is quite selfish/insensitive to employee needs (since your significant other moving is ""silly""), and he objectifies employees and doesn't treat them humanely (anyone who is happy with their employees working like 14 hours a day truly doesn't care about the employees' holistic well-being.)",1359784654

5155332,comment,5154544,5155285,1,0,jdietrich,,,"It's been done on a few cars. The MCC Smart car is mid-engined, so it features s ""service flap"" where the hood would be for things like fluid reservoirs. The engine bay is accessible by lifting a flap in the trunk. The Audi A2 was front-engined, but used a service hatch arrangement as a weight-saving measure - the hood was designed to lift off completely and had no hinges or prop.<p>A service hatch would be a fairly substantial design problem on a performance car. It means that the manufacturer is forced to locate the various fluid bottles close together, most likely near the very front of the car. This is prime real-estate for air intakes and radiators, because taking air from the high-pressure region at the nose has double benefit - more airflow where you want it, less drag where you don't. Elaborate routing of fluid hoses and reservoirs would mean extra weight, which is generally anathema in the car industry.",1359784410
5155331,comment,5155171,5155171,1,0,zerohp,,,"The assumption behind all the ""college is a waste of time"" advice is that you're smart enough, and willing enough to teach yourself. I am like that, and I'll assume you are too. Being smart enough isn't enough, you have to expose yourself to a variety of ideas.<p>I started programming in basic in 3rd grade. I graduated high school in 1996, spent three years in tech support and started programming professionally in 1999. According to my salary I never missed anything by skipping college, but I always felt like I missed out. Two years ago, while working as a telecommuter, I decided to pursue a degree and started taking classes at community college. The math and physics courses opened my mind to ideas that I never really put much thought into. College opened my eyes to ideas that I never would have studied on my own. I quit my job and enrolled at University of Illinois this spring.<p>While I have not yet pursued research, I know that there are many opportunities for undergraduates to research in computer science. Professors typically want junior or senior undergrads because they have enough coursework in the fundamentals to be useful. Right now there is a huge push from the school to get experienced freshman and sophomores into research. They have a funded mentorship program that pays graduate students to work with one or two undergrads on their research. The problem is that they can't get enough underclassmen to apply to the program.<p>Many of the people that post on Hacker News that post a low opinion of the college education were educated in college themselves. Only a very small minority of posters have seen both sides of the coin. I have become a completely different person in the last two years since I started college. This experience has been far more costly for me, at 35, than it is for a typical college-age student. If I add my tuition, fees, and expenses to the opportunity cost, due to lost salary, I am paying $140k a year to go to college. I have no regrets; this has been the best experience of my life.<p>You've probably heard the old saying that youth is wasted on the young. I think college is also wasted on the young. Those that denigrate college were not yet self-aware enough to realize the benefit they gained from that experience.",1359784409

It also logs that message for some other programs I've compiled (like Synergy [1]) and others I've downloaded (like Firefox).<p>In fact, I've seen that message now for the past few years.

One of the things people don't recognize right away is that rarely are you the only person home schooling, there can be lots of people in your area doing the same. One of the programs we did was for science a bunch of us did a one science topic for the week, and everyone in the group's kids would go to that parent's house for some particular expertise or investigation. These were 5, 7 even 10 student groups of similar ages working on the same material. Similarly for Reikes which was 15 - 25 home schooled kids once a week meeting up at a county park to discuss the ecology, bio-diversity, flora, fauna, land management, lots of stuff.<p>If the impression is home schooling is 1 kid sitting at home all day doing the same things they would do in a class room, you are not seeing what is going on around here. Groups of kids tackling problems and learning about history, math, communication, societies and communities, and all the material you'd normally get in school, just in chunkier bits with the opportunity to go deeper into the topic if you're interested and just pick up the required bits if you're not. Lots of reading, lots of field trips (the Sierras are fabulous for doing geology field trips), museums and such. Oh and lots and lots of reading.<p>I'd love to see some more rigorous work on this.",1359782732

They've taken the judicial discretion that ought to have been a rarely needed relief valve and built the entire criminal justice system on top of it by imposing ludicrous maximum penalties and leaving it to the courts to sort it out.

Houses are never worthless even when there are huge housing bubbles. The problem is the runaway, unsustainable cost.<p>I got my degree from a local state school in the mid 90s. And then I went back and pursued another degree in a dual-major for another 3 years before finally deciding I wanted to do something else and leaving school. That was a luxury I had because school was so cheap, my parents paid for most of school and I was able to graduate without any debt. Today that same educational experience at the same school would cost nearly twice as much per year adjusted for inflation. Which is just not supportable without taking on most of it as debt for most people. And if you go to out of state tuition plus rent the costs are enormous, and also unsustainable for even people from reasonably affluent families.<p>Meanwhile, it's become oh so much easier to take on massive amounts of student loan debt, which has no doubt helped fuel some of this bubble.<p>No matter how valuable an education is, and I consider mine plenty valuable, when the cost doubles or more the benefit to cost ratio goes down substantially. And that's the core problem of the education bubble today. It used to be that moderately valuable degrees were still good, because they could be gotten cheaply enough, but now every degree is hugely expensive so the less valuable degrees now have a much lower RoI and are much less worthwhile investments.",1359781779

Should we all just throw our hands up and say &quot;Well, it&#x27;s done now, no point in making a big deal of it?&quot;  I would rather apply pressure to get things fixed, or at least make it well known enough that future language designers give it the care and attention it&#x27;s due.<p><i>There is no idea here other than the writer&#x27;s unjustified expectation that he should just know how every language handles Unicode because??? Because Unicode is a standard? No..</i><p>Are you under the impression that what the author is attempting is not well defined?  The unicode standard has conformance clauses about how to interpret unicode strings[2].  That means that if a language advertises it has/supports unicode strings, and fails the tests we&#x27;ve just seen, it&#x27;s not conformant with the unicode standard.  That would make this useful because it&#x27;s pointing out bugs.  If a language does <i>not</i> advertise unicode support, but supports <i>some</i> unicode features, then this is useful because it&#x27;s making sure people are aware of the limits of their language.

How is that not just a normalization step?<p>Am I correct in thinking that what SOS does is to find the datapoint at the position of lowest flux density, where flux is generated by datapoints and falls off according to some Gaussian-like function of the dissimilarity metric?<p>In other words, it&#x27;s like you&#x27;ve got 100 senators standing in a 172 dimensional senate chamber, positioned according to their votes, and they&#x27;re all shouting.

They&#x27;re definitely outliers, but they&#x27;re still going deaf.  The gaussian is somewhat like specifying a minimum distance so that halving the distance doesn&#x27;t double the flux past a certain point.  And it&#x27;s nice and continuous instead of a hard cutoff.  Anyway, is that an accurate way to think about it?<p>But then, instead of just summing the rows of the affinity matrix and normalizing like I&#x27;d expect, you normalize rows so they sum to 1 (the binding probability matrix) and multiply row values.  My intuition tells me that&#x27;ll give the same ordering as summing and normalizing.  Is that true?

6811523,comment,6808289,6809605,3,0,matsadler,,,"I&#x27;ve not read the code, so someone may have to correct me, but I think this is the gist of it:<p>Ruby 2.1 introduces a generational garbage collector, this divides all objects into young and old generations. A regular GC run will only look at the young generation, with the old being collected less frequently. An object is promoted to the old generation when it survives a young generation run.<p>If you have objects in the old generation referring objects in the young generation, but you&#x27;re only looking at the young generation it may seem like an object doesn&#x27;t have any references, and you might incorrectly GC an in-use object. Write barriers prevent this by adding old generation objects to a &#x27;remember set&#x27; when they are modified to refer to a young generation object (eg old_array.push(young_string)). This &#x27;remember set&#x27; is then taken in to account when collecting the young generation.<p>Most generational garbage collectors need these write barriers on all objects, but with the many 3rd party C extensions available for Ruby this isn&#x27;t possible, so a workaround was devised whereby objects that aren&#x27;t write barrier protected won&#x27;t ever be promoted to the old generation. This isn&#x27;t ideal as you won&#x27;t get the full benefit of the generational GC, but it does maximise backwards compatibility.",1385590449

6811502,comment,6808394,6811096,1,0,strlen,,,"> This is the crux of the entire argument to me. The spirit of the second amendment is to allow the citizenry to violently overthrow the federal government if they become too powerful, as a last-resort measure.<p>That&#x27;s actually not the case. Militia meant &quot;every able bodied white male and sometimes freed blacks&quot; (a more expansive definition than eligible voters -- as there were still property qualifications for voting), who are meant to be armed with common civilian firearms they would purchase themselves. They could be asked to show up at a &quot;muster&quot; by the government, but the second amendment explicitly protected the individual right of militia members  originally from federal government (later on, via 14th amendment, this was extended to the states as well as well as to anyone who is not a felon, mentally ill, etc...).<p>It certainly recognized the right to use these firearms for hunting and self-defense. The common musket at the time -- The Brown Bess -- was smooth bore with a 0.75&quot; caliber and a bead sight, i.e., a 12 gauge shotgun. It could be loaded with buck shoot, with a musket ball, or (as very common) &quot;buck and ball&quot;. So it served both the purposes of militia service weapon, for hunting many kinds of game (which wasn&#x27;t a luxury, but often a necessity), and self-defence (against both humans and wild animals).<p>Ancestors of modern hand grenades (&quot;bombs&quot;), artillery, and so on all existed at the time -- but were not commonly owned by civilians.<p>Rather than try my hand at constitutional scholarship, I&#x27;ll go by the legal theory behind the Heller decision for this. More: <a href=\"http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2013/08/22/justice-scalia-goes-gun-crazy.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2013/08/22/justice-sca...</a><p>Honestly, I&#x27;ll go on record and say that this is good: violent overthrow of the government worked well for the American colonists precisely because they were colonists. The Monarchist loyalists could simply leave, whereas in France, they could only do so sans the head. The stakes were much smaller, so the American revolution (or really &quot;the first American civil war&quot;) did not lead to the horrible outcomes other violent revolutions have almost exclusively lead to. Today, the results would be far far worse -- rather than a blossoming of civil liberties, it would mean revolutionary terror, followed by an even longer period of counter-revolutionary terror. If this happens, I&#x27;ll definitely want to be armed, however -- to defend myself and my family from any of the factions involved in either the revolution or the counter-revolution as I make my way to the nearest port of entry of a peaceful country.<p>Private armies (those reading the &quot;militia&quot; to mean militia groups as opposed to what it actually means) are an even scarier idea. Not to Godwin this, but it reminds me of Freikorps, SA,  as well as KPD/SPD armed groups, and other (sometimes state sponsored, sometimes not) street thugs of Weimar Germany.",1385590171

6811468,comment,6810543,6811337,1,0,novalis78,,,"I agree with you. Let me explain - I think you have to separate bitcoin, the protocol and bitcoins, the currency. Secondly, if you separate the two functions of bitcoins as a storage of value and bitcoins as a currency, it might make more sense. \nAfter each of the last three big crashes, the price built a new base at twice the initial level before the bust and then beat the original high in a relatively short amount of time. This has been going on for 3 years now. If I want to save some money that I can afford to lose potentially, with the main rational that it cannot be inflated long term and can &quot;forget&quot; about (so I don&#x27;t lose sleep over the fluctuations) now I found a secure home for capital that I don&#x27;t want to touch. It took a long time for me to develop that confidence (I daytraded in the past, esp. penny stocks, so &quot;supernovas&quot; are not something new). \nNow, if (the big question of course) bitcoin as a currency continues to be adopted, a bitcoin will be unaffordable and most trading will be in the μBTC etc range we could see it stabilize due to the sheer volume of participants. However, even if that would never be the case, bitcoin as a protocol could lead to innovations in the entire supply chain that make transactions of raw material all the way up to product pricing instantaneous.",1385589852

The hype - get in right now and get rich, or you&#x27;ll miss out and kick yourself - reminds me of 1999. My in-laws were talking about bitcoins yesterday, so bitcoins are getting the attention of the public at large; I take this as a bubble sign rather than a sign of success. Other factors: ease of switching crypto currencies to something else. Zero intrinsic value (unlike e.g. gold). Price manipulation. Risk of theft. Possibility of spectacular software bug blowing everything up.<p>[I&#x27;m not interested in debate; I just want to give my prediction.

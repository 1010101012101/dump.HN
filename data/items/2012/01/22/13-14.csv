3496506,comment,3495341,3495341,8,0,michaelochurch,,,"Copyright has been bastardized. Its original purpose was to protect inventors and artists <i>from</i> wealthy interests: people who had access to the best distribution channels and would put the original authors out of business (if they could legally do so) by distributing their content without payment.<p>Copyright emerged in the same time as modern nations did in Europe and North America. No accident there. (Note that usage fees are called ""royalties"", a payment to the sovereign or the nation.) National governments believed (correctly) that the quality of arts and sciences would be much higher if inventors had a fighting chance of making a living <i>without</i> being born into the access that would enable someone to get a patron. It was a national pride issue: a desire for French or American or Spanish literature to be the best in the world.<p>Copyright replaced the patron system with mass micropayments and thereby democratized it. It's also a <i>lot</i> less expensive than a patronage system: you can get quality media for $1-2 per hour of use. That's pretty great. I wouldn't want to not have that.<p>So let me make that clear. Copyright isn't just a useful thing. It's actually (at its roots) a very <i>liberal</i> concept. It was to protect innovators and creators from wealthy, well-connected miscreants who would steal their work (and before copyright, many did) and compete against them with better distribution.<p>The problem in the modern economy is that copyright is being abused by the same class of people it was designed to hold back. It's way, way, way more transferable than it should be and we have a disease where copyrights and patents, being valuable, trickle up to the top of the social pyramid, under the effective control of a class of people who produce nothing except mean-spirited lawsuits.<p>Morally speaking: should you pay for stuff if you can afford it? Yes. I don't pirate if I can get the same level of convenience and quality through legal means. I have no problem with paying $1-2/hour for quality entertainment. That said, I'd much rather support the artists (and sound technicians, and actors) <i>directly</i> than support a bunch of shitbag executives who produce nothing. I would participate in an ""under the table"" mechanism allowing for that, legal or otherwise-- a ""piratical"" system that requires enough payment to reimburse artists and technicians as much as they'd take in royalties, but deprives the scumbag entertainment executives outright.<p>Honestly speaking, SOPA estabishes that the major corporate copyright owners are evil. Not just greedy and stupid, which are forgivable because great empires have been built on greed and stupidity. Evil. It deprives them of their moral high ground, and establishes that piracy-as-moral-statement might make sense.<p>I also think Facebook and Google deserve <i>a lot</i> of credit for coming out to fight SOPA/PIPA. Yes, Google has Youtube which would be in serious pain; but the fact is that Google and Facebook would (perversely) benefit from it. Large businesses do better in overreaching, ill-designed or undefined regulatory environments because they have the connections and resources to end up OK no matter what laws pass. It's small businesses that would wither and die if SOPA and PIPA were to pass. A lot of startups would have to shut down. ""Social"" technologies would become an oligopoly within a decade. The short-term effect for Google and Facebook would (my guess) be positive, so these companies deserve a lot of credit for looking at the bigger picture.",1327238581

Don't mix up the batteries when you wire them in and make sure you have the right polarity as otherwise you might fry the tubes. Batteries could easily leak, so check them out for problems. If you're on a farm, you might want one powered from your car battery, which meant you could take it back to the car or a generator in order to recharge it. Then there's antenna setup. And tube replacement (since tubes go bad). Also, the early radios (excepting crystal sets) usually had three or more dials. For example, when you change the frequency you need to change the impedance of your antenna to match it. (Raise the lid or read the owner's manual to find the chart of how those correlate.)<p>Radios got simpler to use, in part because of the strong demand to make them simpler. They got simpler to use sometimes at the expense of more internal complexity (a starter motor for an automobile, instead of a crank) but sometimes because we just figured out an easier way to do things (Wozniak's Disk II controller is a classic hacker example) .<p>On the other hand, you are omitting all of the difficult, complex things we used to do, which we don't do now. Do you sew all your clothes, bedsheets, and curtains? I sure don't. Sewing isn't easy. That's a ""whole old level of effort"" I don't need to know. Do you regularly can or preserve your own foods? A few do, but it's easier and cheaper to buy things from the store. Until the last 1800s, many engineers and scientists learned draftsmanship (as different than art, mind you) because that was the best way to make a visual record of what you saw. Of course, the camera has nearly completely replaced that requirement, which we use to learn different things. Evolution, thermodynamics, Maxwell's equations, and more have simplified what was previously a bunch of unconnected concepts.<p>Our culture rides the wave of ""just complex enough."" If it's too complex, like early microcomputers, only a few people make the effort to learn it. It it's useful enough, then there's a lot of work put into making it simpler. When it gets simple enough, there's widespread use. So widespread use happens when something is just barely simple enough for most people to understand.<p>The idea you are talking about is at least 45 years old.  Alvin Toffler wrote ""Future Shock"" in 1970 about this very topic. It popularized the phrase ""information overload"", which was coined in 1964. Note how someone who was 20 then would be an ""elder"" now.<p>Again I ask you, how do you judge that the rate of growth is more now than it was in the 1920s, or the 1970s? What meaningful metrics do you use, and how do you correct for you own biases of what is important? As far as I can tell, excepting the Great Depression, the amount of change and the turmoil over the amount of change has been constant for over a century.",1327238093

I have no doubt that it's possible to wreak havoc on the Israeli economy given enough time, effort, knowledge and Internet access. That knowledge and access is now increasingly available in Arab countries, and there are plenty of people there who want to hurt us in some way.<p>The Israeli government claims that they are taking such threats seriously, but I'm not convinced.  Rather, I'm concerned that this is the beginning of a low-level online war that cannot end well for anyone.<p>My concern doesn't, however, translate into support for online vigilantes who think that playing tit-for-tat games of exposing Arab users' accounts, credit-card information, and other data is acceptable or even desirable.  Exposing the online data of innocent Arabs won't improve Israel's security, won't help to improve our image in the world, and won't deter Arab criminals who enjoy the publicity and notoriety  of exposing Israeli credit-card numbers or bringing down our national airline's Web site.<p>I'm all in favor of the Israeli government using its security knowledge to defend its citizens, or to attack our enemies.

Both have some valid and interesting points and I&#x27;m still not convinced either way.<p>But there&#x27;s a more general theme I find interesting. If you are to predict how long something is going to last, given it already lasted longer than its peers, there are always two kinds of thinking: a) it&#x27;s already stretching itself so it&#x27;ll end soon, or b) the fact it already lasted this long means our references are not correct, and this could last a lot longer than we thought possible.",1413856727

Assuming it is not doing a nursery gc every millisecond, all those objects should die in the nursery almost immediately.  It has been well understood for at least twenty years how to do that in O(live objects), and the JVM has for all its many faults a very good garbage collector.  So I am quite skeptical.  This is also at odds with empirical evidence which is that going from 1.7 to 1.8 with the same world improves framerate.<p>Now the JVM gc has about a million tuning parameters and most hardcore Minecrafters have a witches brew of tuning that they run with.  It&#x27;s far from impossible that those tuning parameters are totally inappropriate with 1.8.  But the GC should handle this fine.",1413856412

And if it’s growing faster than the statistical strength of the data, then many of your inferences are likely to be false. They are likely to be white noise.<p>It&#x27;s actually worse than that. What I see is that when companies have the ability to store and &quot;analyze&quot; large amounts of data, their appetite for <i>data</i> tends to increase. So they seek to take in as much data as they can find. More often than not, the quality of the data is mixed at best. Frequently, it&#x27;s horrible, and because the focus is on data acquisition and not data quality, nobody notices the bad data, missing data and duplicate data.<p>The result: even if you manage to come up with decent hypotheses, you can&#x27;t trust the data on which you test them.",1413856195

A GC only scans live memory and considers the whatever hasn&#x27;t been scanned as garbage. If most of your memory isn&#x27;t live, as seems to be the case here, collection should be relatively consistent, regardless of allocated memory or the memory available to the JVM. Increasing the memory available should actually increase performance, because the JVM can run collections less often.<p>It seems to me that what the devs should do (instead of waiting for a proper struct implementation, like .NET has, on the JVM, which would avoid these problems) is to make BlockPos mutable and store unused objects in a cache/buffer. This might be (barely) slower than just allocating the memory, but used correctly it will trigger fewer collections as you allocate way less.",1413855349

This meant that though default would be systemd, a package could not depend on systemd explicitly.<p>Bdale called for votes by choosing to vote for &quot;which init system&quot; first.

Wouldn&#x27;t building of a light rail in a town or region come with an increase in taxes anyway for a good number of years? Is that a &quot;sin&quot; tax?<p>> I honestly thing the best way to do it is build a better bus<p>A bus is a bus. Unless the wheels are falling off.

This is hard to say but in many cities, public transportation is often used by those that cannot drive, that unfortunately includes crazy people. You might not otherwise encounter them but you will on public transportation. In some cities it is a small nuisance. In some it happens often because almost everyone who is capable of driving is driving or getting rides. That bus could have gold plates handles and it could even be free, and a lot of people will still opt for driving.<p>> Firstly, because the pain is felt by everyone.<p>Yes. It can&#x27;t be just artificially and locally manufactured pain -- sin taxes. Why would they ever vote for that? Why would a small quiet suburb of some major city just decide to vote to punish themselves for driving? But the pain has to already be there -- horrible traffic.

Sec. 106(2)\n    (1982), by preparing a derivative work based on\n    Lokey. The district court did not address this\n    issue.\n\n    Section 106(2) grants the exclusive rights to\n    prepare a derivative work to the holder of the\n    copyright. 17 U.S.C. Sec. 106(2). To constitute a\n    violation of section 106(2) the infringing work must\n    incorporate in some form a portion of the\n    copyrighted work. Notes of the Committee on the\n    Judiciary, House Report No. 94-1476, reprinted in 17\n    U.S.C. Sec. 106(2) (1982).\n\n    Litchfield argues that section 106(2) was intended\n    to expand the definition of derivative works to\n    include any work based on a copyrighted work. She\n    argues that the similarities between her play and\n    the movie constitute the required &quot;incorporation&quot;\n    and show that E.T. was based on Lokey for purposes\n    of the statute. Litchfield apparently believes that\n    she does not have to show substantial similarity to\n    show that E.T. is a derivative work.\n\n    Litchfield cites no authority to support this novel\n    proposition. The little available authority suggests\n    that a work is not derivative unless it has been\n    substantially copied from the prior work. See Harry\n    Fox Agency, Inc. v. Mills Music, Inc., 543 F.Supp.\n    844, 849 (S.D.N.Y.1982), rev&#x27;d on other grounds, 720\n    F.2d 733 (2d Cir.1983), cert. granted sub nom. Mills\n    Music, Inc. v. Snyder, --- U.S. ----, 104 S.Ct.\n    1676, 80 L.Ed.2d 151 (1984); Reyher v. Children&#x27;s\n    Television Workshop, 533 F.2d 87, 90 (2d Cir.),\n    cert. denied, 429 U.S. 980, 97 S.Ct. 492, 50 L.Ed.2d\n    588 (1976); 1 M. Nimmer, The Law of Copyright, Sec.\n    3.01 at 3-3 (1983 ed.).\n</code></pre>\nHere&#x27;s what the House Report the court cites says [4]:<p><pre><code>   To be an infringement the “derivative work” must be “based\n   upon the copyrighted work,” and the definition in section\n   101 refers to “a translation, musical arrangement, dramatization,\n   fictionalization, motion picture version, sound recording, art\n   reproduction, abridgment, condensation, or any other form in\n   which a work may be recast, transformed, or adapted.” Thus,\n   to constitute a violation of section 106 (2), the infringing\n   work must incorporate a portion of the copyrighted work in some\n   form; for example, a detailed commentary on a work or a\n   programmatic musical composition inspired by a novel would not\n   normally constitute infringements under this clause.\n</code></pre>\nIn Reyher v. Children&#x27;s Television Workshop, 533 F.2d 87 [5], which is also cited by the Litchfield court, the court says:<p><pre><code>   Generally, &quot;(a) work is not derivative unless it has substantially\n   copied from a prior work. If that which is borrowed consists merely\n   of ideas and not of the expression of ideas, then although the work\n   may have in part been derived from prior works, it is not a derivative\n   work.&quot; 1 M. Nimmer on Copyright § 39 at 166-167 (1975) (hereinafter &quot;Nimmer&quot;)\n</code></pre>\nThe Perfect 10 case also comments on what is necessary in order for something to be a derivative work:<p><pre><code>   For example, a “Game Genie” device that allowed a player to alter\n   features of a Nintendo computer game did not infringe Nintendo’s right\n   to prepare derivative works because the Game Genie did not incorporate\n   any portion of the game itself. See Lewis Galoob Toys, Inc. v. Nintendo\n   of Am., Inc., 964 F.2d 965, 967 (9th Cir. 1992). We held that a copyright\n   holder’s right to create derivative works is not infringed unless the\n   alleged derivative work “incorporate[s] a protected work in some concrete\n   or permanent ‘form.’ ” Id.\n</code></pre>\n> Dirty tests are often not enough in discussion around law<p>Right, and if I would not even attempt to offer a quick and dirty test to determine if a work that copies from another work is an infringing derivative work or if the copying can be excused by some factor such as fair use.<p>Sometimes, however, you can make simple quick rules that do work. In the case of derivative works, since for work X to be a derivative work of work Y, there must by copying from Y into X, it follows that if the creator of X works in such a way that they cannot have copied from Y, they cannot have created a derivative work.<p>I would have assumed most tech people already knew this, as it is the key idea that makes clean room design work. One team reverse engineers the specimen product, and writes a specification to cover whatever it is that the specimen does. Then a second team, that does not overlap the first, implements a product from that specification. The second team does not have access to any copyrighted material from the specimen, and so their implementation is not a derivative work, and they can market it safe from copyright liability. (This doesn&#x27;t protect them from patent liability, though. There might also be contract issues if in order to get the specimen, the first team had to agree to not reverse engineer it. We&#x27;re just talking about copyright here, though, and this procedure does deal with that risk).<p>[1] <a href=""http://cdn.ca9.uscourts.gov/datastore/opinions/2007/12/03/0655405.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://cdn.ca9.uscourts.gov/datastore/opinions/2007/12/03/06...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copyright_aspects_of_hyperlinking_and_framing#State_of_US_law_after_Arriba_Soft_and_Perfect_10"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copyright_aspects_of_hyperlinki...</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://openjurist.org/736/f2d/1352/litchfield-v-spielberg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://openjurist.org/736/f2d/1352/litchfield-v-spielberg</a><p>[4] <a href=""http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Copyright_Law_Revision_(House_Report_No._94-1476)"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Copyright_Law_Revision_(House_...</a><p>[5] <a href=""http://openjurist.org/533/f2d/87"" rel=""nofollow"">http://openjurist.org/533/f2d/87</a>",1392001366

It actually worked out great in my case, albeit largely because I chanced across several high quality instructors that were able to challenge me.<p>I am glad I followed the curriculum as well, though. In the end, you&#x27;ll need to take calculus (et al) at some point, and taking it as soon as possible meant that it could help form my mind earlier, and allowed me to progress beyond even sooner. Specifically, I followed the sequence: differential calculus, integral calculus, multivariate calculus, differential equations, and linear algebra (and then I transferred to Berkeley&#x27;s math program). That&#x27;s a lot for a young mind to soak in, and the type of student these classes select for make an excellent social environment as well (inevitably, the type that likes learning).<p>If I were to make a recommendation between following the curriculum, and pursuing extra-curriculars, I&#x27;d say: do both.",1392001344

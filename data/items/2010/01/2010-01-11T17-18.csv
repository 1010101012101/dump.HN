1045560,comment,1044615,1045510,0,0,weavejester,,,"Java source code is especially verbose <i>because</i> Java has a very primitive and restrictive syntax.<p>This shouldn't be news to anyone. Java lacks macros, type inference, and currying. It lacks a concise mechanism for lambda forms, and variables in closures have to be made final. There is no way to delay evaluation of an expression, save through the default control structures. The generic typing system does not persist to runtime, and it does not support covariant or contravariant types. There is no multiple inheritance supported, nor any mechanism for mixins. Interfaces cannot be applied to classes after they are defined. Types are nullable by default, which is a remarkably dumb idea for a static language. Functions cannot exist outside a class, and the syntax is littered with redundant keywords like 'new'.<p>Should I continue?<p>Java's shortcomings are many and well known. Calling Java ""primitive and restrictive"" is not baseless language bashing; it's an observation of the design decisions made by the developers of the Java language.",1263232709

I read a ton of PDFs: research papers, online manuals, natve PDF books and some books that are scans packaged as PDFs.  My previous ebook was a Sony 505 but the screen size was too small to make this a practical reader for me.  most PDFs out there do not support the ""tagged"" format that makes text reflow with the ebook posible. To make a PDF usable I would have to do an elaborate conversion dance of trimming  and tweaking contrasts with some PDFs needing to be re- converted to landscape mode after several attempts at squashing them to fit portrait mode.<p>My eventual conclusion was that I needed an ebook with a bigger screen.  After waiting and waiting for an apple tablet announcement I went with a kindle dx and it has been great.  It does not hit all of the items in your requirements list (I keep the wireless off to conserve battery, the keyboard is almost never used except to jump to specific pages, and it's support of annotation is ""weak"" at best) but it is probably the best option out there for my needs.<p>My advice would be to start by deciding what screen size you need and letting all other requirements and feature comparisons flow from that decision.",1263232609

When I googled around for it, I came across the Perils of Java Schools (<a href=""http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/ThePerilsofJavaSchools.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/ThePerilsofJavaSchool...</a>).<p>At that point, it struck me that Joel knew a lot more than I  did, so I decided to send him an email asking what schools were best.  Not only did he answer, but there was actually some correspondence that led to a good short list for me.  After being accepted to Carnegie Mellon, MORE correspondence helped me avoid Information Systems (an easier track that the football coach at CMU was trying to get me to pursue).  For lack of a better description, Joel Spolsky was the best college guidance counselor I had.<p>I think it's important to keep in mind that, when I asked him for help, I was a slightly above average public high school student in Hilliard, Ohio, so he was just being a really nice guy.",1263232282

So if you're writing the client handler for a database, or something like memcached, you need this technique (whether you need an abstraction library is another argument...).<p>But most apps don't fall into those categories, and I'm not getting any of that vibe from this.

It splits sequential algorithms up into multiple callbacks with manually managed shared state.

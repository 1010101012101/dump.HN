I think that the review process adds a certain value to the App Store. I know that if I download an app, (1) it will run and (2) it will do more or less what the description says. That is not to say that this is the one true way, but it adds value.<p>I think a model that the web has followed is better: apps should be ranked based on some organic factors (e.g.: content of description + reviews) and the best apps can just float to the top.

Toyota's brake problems puts people in fear of their lives.<p>When Apple lost 5% market cap, it was obvious that people were panicking. They could easily afford free bumpers, and a free upgrade to affected customers when the next iPhone comes out, for the price of the downgrades they were getting.

Take batteries for example.  Companies in the US thought the process was simple and there was nothing to gain from keeping the manufacturing in the US.  Well, they outsourced it to other countries in order to cut costs and look what happened.  Lithium Ion batteries came about.<p>On the same note, I have found that starting sentences out loud before I finish the complete sentence in my head yields much more content, wit, and many times even better points.

Instead, they record themselves improvising, quickly realizing a better phrase should have been used, stopping, and improvising again.  If they can't come up with a word or phrase to fit into the sentence, they make a sound that fits the flow and come back to it later.<p>In short, be involved with current material as closely as possible in order to create new material.

1534172,comment,1534082,1534082,0,0,mdasen,,,"So, there was an AP story about this that I think did a better job detailing the challenges for LightSquared (<a href=""http://hosted2.ap.org/txdam/7d2a091809034418bf02b94fe7a8c4b9/Article_2010-07-20-US-TEC-Wireless-Broadband/id-88dba65beffd4e908d1881cedbd6eb5a"" rel=""nofollow"">http://hosted2.ap.org/txdam/7d2a091809034418bf02b94fe7a8c4b9...</a>).<p>Specifically, there are a couple of things I'd point out:<p>1. They have to put at least 1 satellite into service.  That's a huge cost for something that you have no intention of making an important part of your service.<p>2. They're banking on the FCC changing rules surrounding their ""satellite"" spectrum.  Current rules say that it can be used to create a terrestrial network to back up the satellite service, but every device they sell has to be able to communicate with the satellite.  That would make it prohibatively expensive to provision customers with devices against companies who don't have that restruction.<p>The $7B contract to build and maintain the network also seems a bit light.  Carriers like Verizon and AT&T spend around $7B annually to improve and maintain their networks and they aren't starting from scratch.  $7B over 8 years comes out to under $900M per year.<p>Granted, 4G should be cheaper to deploy since the equipment takes up less space and there's no need for a lot of expensive and large things to support legacy phone stuff.  Still, Clearwire (who is rolling out 4G WiMAX) had capital expenditure of $690M in the first quarter of this year alone.  Although that probably includes more than just network expenditure, Clearwire has yet to cover most people.<p>If they're able to pull it off, it'll be great!  If a company can reduce the cost of rolling out a network, it usually means lower prices for consumers (assuming adequate competition).  So, hopefully we'll see a great nationwide LTE network from LightSquared in a few years!",1279679874

Not that libev is a rather huge software, it's basically a wrapper around whatever the host OS provides (select, epoll, kqueue). From looking at it, eventmachines's C extension does the same. So my main point stands: A big part of the performance characteristics of node come from a lower-level C functionality. I guess that having an infrastructure that's mostly asynchronous comes second.

The desktops and laptops have been a fairly slow-moving target lately, and particularly for the laptops they haven't been doing much in the way of revolutionary hardware design since introducing the unibody enclosures. Apple's relatively high profit margins also mean that sales can fall to a very low level before a product line becomes unprofitable. When you also consider how much easier it is to maintain Mac OS X as an iOS development platform than to make Windows a good development platform (due to the strong similarities between iOS and Mac OS X and Apple's control over both), and when you consider that Apple doesn't have any trouble attracting iOS developers in spite of the Mac-only development tools, it's pretty clear that the Mac can keep making Apple money, even if they don't put much work in to it.",1279678565

I think I like it for the reason you describe: it's libraries, rather than frameworks. But I've started getting into some ASP.NET code and the frameworkiness is starting to appear. In my case it's entity objects which don't seem to do more than structs, interfaces for classes which talk to the entity objects, implementation classes to implement the interfaces which just copy data from entity objects into their own properties, business objects which talk to the interfaces to get to the entity data, and UI objects/templates that talk to the business objects, probably through another layer of interface/implementation.<p>From what I can tell, SharePoint is another big layer of framework on top of ASP.NET, governing the way your application must be designed and function.",1279678042

Thus, the details are considered public, regardless of previous disclosure details.<p>These capture the imagination and frustrate system administrators because 0-day -- due to their unknown nature and nearly infinite possibility -- cannot be simply ""fixed.""<p>This has been a core frustration of mine in the network defense community for years:  our procedures are too narrowly focused on protection -- keeping bad guys out.

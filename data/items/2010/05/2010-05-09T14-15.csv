Anyone renting an unfurnished apartment who doesn't want to fill it with stuff (e.g. because they're just there for the summer) should be able to use the service. The domain Unfurnished.com would be ideal (might be pricey, though).<p>Here's how I'd implement it: Sell the items, but offer a partial refund on return. (Less risky than rental, for both parties—obviously for the seller, but also for the buyer if they wind up needing the stuff for longer than expected.) Specialize in light-weight, durable items that can be shipped economically: air mattresses, plastic tableware, folding furniture. Include a pre-printed shipping label in the box. The pitch: ""Zappos for apartment stuff."" (Just checked, and ApartmentStuff.com is being parked on.) Ideally, the stuff should be custom-branded.",1273417193

1332093,comment,1330080,1330080,0,0,DennisP,,,"Abstractions and code generation. Start by being completely intolerant of repetitive code. Boilerplate must die. Closures can help a lot with this.<p>To whatever extent you can't abstract away, use code generation. Make your generator insert code directly into your project files, maybe in between comment tags. You want to be able to configure things with minimal code and hit a button to get everything you need.<p>I'm experimenting with using emacs for this, but generally I've just built c# projects to generate my c# code. On one project this had an unexpected benefit: I realized I could change my generator from a compiler to an interpreter, doing everything at runtime, and I got a very concise and flexible data-driven project, with 1/3 the lines of code as a similar project built by a contractor that had everything hardcoded.<p>Of course, know your language and libraries well. You don't want to be googling for every little thing. To help learn the libraries, staged memory software like anki or mnemosyne can be a big help.<p>Finally, get really good at a topnotch text editor. I'm about 8 months into using Vim for everything (mainly via Viemu, a plugin for Visual Studio) and it makes a huge difference. It's not just that I can edit faster, but that it helps keep me in flow.",1273417002

How many users did Facebook have in 2005? Twitter in 2007? Google has put enormous resources behind Google+, and they don't show any sign of backing down. They're taking dozens of separate services that they provide and integrating them through Google+. In 5 years, that's going to be a very compelling platform.",1341014395

That's life, stop lamenting it. These people didn't get on the sports team, they didn't get a girlfriend at 14, they really are struggling to find themselves and they're struggling in so many other areas, so let them revel in their actual skills for god's sake and grow up and accept it, even if they can't. Because emotionally you're so much older than they are.<p>I am getting a little annoyed with the 'women in tech' meme, we can't all be rounded individuals at 18 because society, almost deliberately, is failing a large section of males. If this is making tech a male dominated arena then so be it. It is refreshingly simple and without the emotional nuance that many young males find hard to comprehend, IF this THEN that. Our society brought it on ourselves.<p>Men are different to women. Women are different to men. What you are describing in this article, almost heart breakingly, is many a male geeks first steps into a social world. To expect them to be able to function as effectively as you with other people is wrong. They can't yet. Some of them will flower.

They decided instead that I had gone to a similarly-named university in the United States. I'm not sure what happened to the old page/affiliation, but Facebook couldn't handle it.<p>Recently, I discovered that one of my former employers had been acquired and changed/lost their Facebook page. Now, Facebook is trying to convince me that I actually worked for a band with a similar name to the former name of the company I had worked for.<p>In neither case was I informed of the change.

Apple's lawyers are celebrating tonight.<p>EDIT: If I plan to kill a cat, and you file a lawsuit to stop me, the judge may issue an injunction for me not to kill the cat until the lawsuit is complete.  Humanity does not know how to unkill a cat, so if I did so while the lawsuit was pending, I would make the lawsuit moot and evade justice.  That is ""irreparable harm"", at least if it's your cat.<p>On the other hand, if my actions are causing you mere monetary harm, we know exactly how to repair that: take money from me and give it to you.  Injunctions should not be issued in such cases, because the plaintiff can always be made whole later on by simply receiving an appropriate amount of money.<p>Apple has managed to have a bogus patent issued - the patent, as far as I can tell, covers any sort of ""search-as-you-type"" system.  Any sort.  The Firefox awesome bar, Android search (every Android device that exists), Google Instant, any webpage with javascript autocomplete...  you're all violating Apple's patent.

4179771,comment,4178882,4179648,2,0,lusr,,,"It's an invalid argument because not all projects are alike.  Facebook and Wikipedia are indeed very successful projects but they have a massive advantage over the types of projects I deal with in enterprise environments.  For instance:<p>- technical environment:  the Facebook/Wikipedia/generally-any-web-startup architects get to choose their technical environment 100%;  in most corporates you need to integrate with legacy applications and databases in a specific environment, often enforced by IT policy, and this imposes significant constraints on which languages will be feasible options<p>- interoperability:  for large, modular systems developed by disparate teams over decades with little or no standards or co-ordination, a statically typed language can be absolutely invaluable for ensuring interoperability and discovering usage (documentation is typically non-existent in these environments, as are tests, and the latter is seldom - often impossible - to retrofit);  even for new systems, static typing can save a lot of time when developing and integrating new work across large teams, in my opinion<p>- resistance:  business and technical knowledge lives in developers who are part of an ancient stack, e.g. Microsoft or Oracle or Borland;  switching to PHP or Python or Ruby etc. means convincing these people to learn very different new technologies (good luck - won't happen), figuring out how to interface with legacy stuff using a language outside of the stack, introducing new tool chains, etc.j<p>- time & budget:  even if the existing developers are keen to learn, it's tough convincing the project manager you need an extra month to go through the upskilling process and that you need to spend time researching interoperability options, and that inevitably you will run into future issues, etc.;  the problem is most projects are run and budgeted for on a local cost benefit analysis and very rarely would the benefit of switching languages for one project be worth it (even though, in the big picture across multiple projects, it may very well be)<p>An observation:  whenever this debate comes up on the HN, the proponents of modern, dynamic languages are invariably people working in closed environments where they have the freedom to set standards, do things right from the beginning (coding standards & reviews, tests, documentation) and the ability to make technology selections across the board.  Often this freedom is not a characteristic of other environments, and consequently the language used in a one environment may be unsuitable in another.",1341013900

The first lecture was all about abstractions and lambda's, and nothing about Lisp/Scheme syntax --- and the first problem set asked you to code in Scheme.   You were expected to figure it all out from the language reference manual.<p>That was a pretty big leveler back then, because most students, even those who had used a lot of computers in grade school and elementary school, were mostly exposed to Apple II's and TRS-80's and Microsoft Basic.

113250,comment,113210,113210,0,0,JayNeely,,,"Here's the comment I left at TechCrunch, though right now it's awaiting moderation:<p>It is a mistake to think of Yahoo! as competing for search dominance. As Yahoo! has reiterated several times at this point, their strategy is to become the starting point for the web, not the search engine. Search is only one tool web users need, and Yahoo! has no interest in being the place they come to for it. They would rather be the place people leave from, time and time again.<p>So, how does a merger with AOL help Yahoo!?<p>1) Yahoo! maintains its position as the top site on the web. Quantcast shows that adding AOL’s visitors to Yahoo!’s puts Yahoo! at almost 200 million monthly uniques, almost 50% ahead of Google. ComScore data is less exact, since it groups AOL under “Time Warner Network”, but still shows the same trend:<p>- <a href=""http://www.quantcast.com/top-sites-1"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.quantcast.com/top-sites-1</a><p>- <a href=""http://www.comscore.com/press/.....press=2000"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.comscore.com/press/.....press=2000</a><p>2) Yahoo! becomes the dominant player in IM. Yahoo! Messenger is already interoperable with Windows Live Messenger; adding interoperability with AIM means that they control ~70% of desktop IM client market share(more recent numbers on this are needed, but by the end of 2006 AIM was ~50 million, and both Yahoo! and Microsoft’s were ~20 million), and their clients can talk to everyone else’s. Yahoo! and AOL have both made progress in integrating IM with E-mail, something Microsoft still hasn’t done. As Yahoo! expands its e-mail services into enterprise markets, and enterprises increase their usage of IM, this could be a big deal.<p>3) Much better integration potential than with Microsoft. After being stuck in Time Warner’s in-fighting old media bureaucracy for so long, I’d imagine that AOL employees would be overjoyed to be brought into an organization that understands and is about the web. There’s also excellent potential for brand integration here:<p>- Yahoo! is a brand AOL users would be comfortable with.<p>- It’s a brand that it makes sense for AOL to adopt as it’s been expanding overseas operations(where Yahoo! already has a strong presence).<p>- The Yahoo! brand offers a graceful way to retire a brand that the tech-savvy have long scorned.<p>- Go to Yahoo.com, then go to AOL.com. The portals are almost identical. It’s feasible that a full-scale integration of the two properties could at some point take place.<p>4) There are plenty of other reasons why an AOL/Yahoo! merger has potential. Concentration of content-provider partnerships, joint efforts in mobile services/advertising, online/offline music offerings, and the fact that both are much more youth-friendly brands than MSN or Google. Plus more.<p>But TechCrunch isn’t paying me to write guest posts in their comments, so that’s all for now.",1202708916

113248,comment,113057,113057,0,0,jackdied,,,"For the same reason that open source projects are started by one guy with running code and not by committees talking about what to do.  Everyone with an opinion isn't necessarily your customer - they are just guys with opinions.<p>You could be non-secretive without being interactive or not taking opinions.  But that seems like burning PR early for a product you will be releasing soon anyway.<p>Do talk with people who's opinions you already value.  But you aren't Microsoft so pre-announcing a product won't intimidate others into not competing with you and it won't whet potential customer's appetite.  Make something you know you would use and then see how others like you respond.",1202708808

113241,comment,113184,113184,0,0,eas,,,"I've always wondered why we really haven't seen more franchising of U.S. schools among the higher-tiers (beyond ITT Tech, U of Phoenix, etc.). And what's the real reason we see NYU-Qatar but not NYU-Los Angeles?<p>For example, is it the risk of brand dilution? Local competition relative to int'l--it's relatively easy money out there? That many schools actually operate at a loss (excluding endowment) ex:[1]? Do you think that the lower costs of int'l education (labor, infrastructure) changes that dynamic, since it seems they are outsourcing everything except the name and ""curriculum""? Does doing it internationally make it easier since most of the U.S. alumni won't drive by the franchises on the highway? The benefits of international R&D collaboration and the ready supply of customers as TheTarquin mentions? Just curious.<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swarthmore_College"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swarthmore_College</a>",1202707878
113240,comment,113079,113169,0,0,paulgb,,,"I would imagine the network effect for something like this is huge, and basically re-enforces the market leader's position to a point that it would be hard to dethrone them. I remember Yahoo used to have auctions, and didn't Amazon try it too? I don't know if either is still at it, but clearly it didn't take off like eBay.<p>The network effect is even more important with the auction model, because both the price and volume of sales depend on the number of buyers. I can imagine that sellers would be reluctant to join a new auction site if it means risking getting lower margins. Although, some of the examples in the article would disagree.",1202707782
113239,comment,113079,113233,0,0,pg,,,"Back in the 1998 at Yahoo we used to hear shocking things about how bad eBay's systems were.  One of the externally visible signs was their policy of having several hours a week of scheduled downtime.  That seemed just inexcusable.  Do they still do that?<p>I think the reason eBay is so inept is that they were a monopoly almost from the beginning.  So at a stage when other startups (Google for example) had to work hard to succeed, they were already coasting, at least technically.",1202707771

I have no idea if it'll work, but I love the idea of separating the act of tipping and the act of paying.<p>Do users get a reputation based on the proportion of tips they eventually pay out? Can you force users to tip (e.g. you must tip before you get to read this article, regardless of whether you're going to pay eventually).<p>And please make it multi-lingual! I'd love to try out a tipping-based business model, but just English won't cut it for me.<p>Nice to see another great idea in the winter batch, btw!",1202706941

The site hasn't changed much since.</i><p>Someone who consulted there told me that eBay's codebase was a mess (even by the usual standards) and that they had some strange processes that made it worse. If I recall correctly, programmers weren't allowed to work in teams and were frequently 'rotated' through completely unrelated projects. He told me some other weird things that I don't remember, but that combined to form an impression that eBay's culture is really inimical to hackers. That would explain their technical stagnation. But overwhelming market share gives them powerful inertia.",1202706564

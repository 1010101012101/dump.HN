But I guess he's also admitting that when you reach a certain point, you need people who know how to get inside from experience in order to really hit it big.  But when starting up, he seems to say avoid getting those people involved.<p><i>One of the lessons we learned is that professional managers hired from the industries you're trying to disrupt tend not to be very beneficial. This whole idea that Mark Zuckerberg should stay CEO of Facebook, as opposed to being replaced by a professional manager, that was one of the things we learned at PayPal early on. If you look at the PayPal companies, they did not try to replace the initial leadership with supposedly more qualified people.
Don't hire people from the industries you're trying to disrupt. They have too much ideological baggage about the way things have to work.<p>One of the ways PayPal was so successful is we did not know all the Visa and MasterCard rules we were supposedly violating. There were other companies who didn't pursue what we were pursuing because they thought it'd be a violation of the rules. In fact, was it a violation of the rules? At most it was a grey area because Visa and MasterCard rules weren't written for the Internet....<p>eBay certainly felt constrained -- this may have been a rationalization after the fact for losing to a company they so clearly should have beaten -- but they always said they felt too constrained with the risks and liability they could take on. PayPal was able to take on these massive liabilities because if the company didn't work it was going to go out of business anyway so there was nothing to lose.<p>BI: How do you apply those lessons here at Yammer? Particularly in hiring -- do you look for people who have never worked at big software companies?<p>DS: Yes. There's a strong strand of consumer DNA in our company. Out of the first 15 people who started, none of them worked at an enterprise software company. I don't think we hired anyone who had worked at an enterprise software company until last year. We came at it from a blank slate. What we've learned is there are certain enterprise functions we've had to backfill. There's been this steady process of starting with a consumer mindset and then saying, ""OK, we need an enterprise sales team. We need some enterprise marketing to back them up.""<p>BI: Do you find you need a big enterprise sales force to compete with the big guys?<p>DS: In the large accounts, yes.</i><p><a href=""http://www.businessinsider.com/david-sacks-qa-2011-11#ixzz1g2Aa0Cyn"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.businessinsider.com/david-sacks-qa-2011-11#ixzz1g...</a>",1323428396

But then I relaized that this will not work in every major / profession. My girlfriend is doing lots of things and somehow suffers under the heavy workload. But I can't give her this kind of advice because (at least here in Germany) it does not apply to someone who studies philosophy and politics and wants to get into the best positions as development worker. Why? because nobody cares about your marks. You basically get a degree for the sake of the degree itself and for living a students life while doing as much extracurricular activities as possible. Internships, important roles in local divisions of NGOs and so on are almost everything that counts for getting the job you want.<p>Personally, I still think ""Do fewer things; do them better; know why you're doing them"" worked incredibly well for me and may help many other students, I is probably not for everyone and certainly not for every subject.",1323427863

3333306,comment,3332357,3333119,2,0,inoop,,,"> Well, except that Android allows apps to run arbitrary native code using the NDK.<p>I was under the assumption that they can support native code because of the way they designed Android, not the other way around. I highly doubt that supporting native code was the design rationale here. I think they just designed Dalvik to use Linux threads and assume it to run inside its own process. That certainly makes things much simpler for the VM. The fact that you can safely load native code follows naturally.<p>Still, supporting native code does not have to dictate how you ensure memory protection, or whether each app has to run inside its own process. You can always run a native library (i.e. a video codec) inside a separate process and use memory-safe communication with the process that runs the Java app. You can also go the NACL route.<p>There's absolutely no reason why supporting native code would result in a choppy UI on Android.",1323427821

From my experience, most of the kids at these high level science fairs just make reports over stuff they've worked on (not designed) in a lab.<p>My sister is currently working on a pretty good science fair project involving paint that can generate solar power. The cycle for this was to come up with an idea, email universities/labs in the area, find a mentor who agrees to work with them, and then just listen to and do what the mentor advises. Its still a great project and she is learning a ton from it, but not really something she designed and I wouldn't be happy to compete against it with something I came up with and made in my garage.<p>Overall, I wish there was some sort of limit to how much the mentors are able to be involved. I had a ton of fun (and learned a lot) doing $150 max budget, internet research only projects mostly on my own (sometimes had help from my dad building apparatus), but its pretty impossible to compete with people working out of labs with professional help.<p>Also, I just realized that some guy I met a few months ago when school started (and who I have classes with) won the Siemens competition last year.",1323427647

3333290,comment,3330847,3331534,4,0,skrebbel,,,"> <i>Also, what is the point on having a production quality Redis server on Windows?</i><p>I (co-)run a small bootstrapped startup running on a Windows server. We're considering to use Redis as our primary (only) database. For us, the simple ability to run Redis and our main C# application on the same box, in the beginning, would be a big plus. It simply saves a server, and unifies our production environment to a single OS.<p>Of course, it's just something relevant in the very beginning, and probably only for the non-valley-super-funded kind of startups. But it's this kind of stuff that might make us change our minds about Redis; if we can avoid doing system administration on two different OS'es for the time being, plus avoid installing two servers per application instance, then that's really a big plus for us. It allows us more time for functionality and less time for all kinds of admin scripting and whatnot. Of course, you could reason that we should simply switch off Windows entirely, but we really like C# and Visual Studio and we're productive in it.<p>Also, it'd be great to be able to develop against a more ""official"" version of Redis then what we have now.<p>Note, I'm not at all telling you what to do. I'm just giving you an idea why maybe it <i>is</i> useful to consider supporting Windows, using my personal situation as an example. Not every startup chooses Ruby or Node. Not every developer prefers a Mac. For the same reason I also humbly doubt the 99.99% number you quote. I think if you'd move to support Windows better, that number would decrease because organisations and people who run on Windows will now often simply disregard Redis as an option.<p>Especially corporate environments (business IT for instance) are usually <i>very</i> heavily Windows-based. The same holds for nearly the entire ""high tech"" industry (software for machines, devices, factory lines - e.g. nearly any office-scale printer you can buy runs Windows, nearly all factory management (MES/SCADA) software is Windows-based, etc.). These are industries that could benefit a lot from the performance increases Redis could give them (by using it essentially in the same way as stackoverflow does). My bet is they'd often be reluctant to even consider it if it means training an entire sysadmin force for a new OS. And that's even disregarding the software vendors who (so oldschool) sell software installed by clients (f.ex. the factory line stuff). They want to make their software faster, they don't want to force their client to administrate an extra OS.<p>Once again: not telling you what to do, it's your call (and I'm thankful for Redis no matter what). I'm just saying: mind the big jolly POSIX filter bubble; there's a big, big world out there, and a lot of it is very much not POSIX.",1323427218

They track how many errors you have and on what kind of merchandise, and determine how trust-worthy you are and how often you should be manually checked.<p>I can't remember if this was already implemented or just a suggestion from somewhere, but the self-scanning devices could track your location in the store, both to analyze customer behaviour but also to monitor any suspicious activity.

I'm just as sceptical about ""passion"" as Cal is, but at least one might need to discover some kind of drive towards achievement. For me it seems to be a particular kind of curiosity to ""understand"" something difficult, and use it to build stuff.

For me, 'fast enough' in terms of subjective performance of an application is 'as fast as the current performance benchmark on that platform'. Anything less implies the developer has taken short cuts and creates a bad impression. On mobile devices even more so.<p>Sure, if your app can be neatly divided into broad sections of performance critical and non performance critical code, then you can save the C for the bottlenecks. But it's hard to know ahead of time where those bottlenecks will be, nowadays even more so with highly interactive mobile apps. Look at all the trouble Google have had making Android scroll smoothly for example.<p>In a marketplace where users will dismiss your app immediately over tiny glitches and pauses, I'd be inclined to write everything in C++ other than the Objective C stuff.",1323425091

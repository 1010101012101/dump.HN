Expecting employees to work overtime is obviously not the right approach. Creating an environment that's so much fun that employees would choose to work overtime is. I like Google's approach better than 37singals'. Google created a fun environment so that employees stay longer because the love it, not because they have to.",1204796949

But I was enjoying the work so much, I did it for the fun of it. And I would do it again if I come across interesting projects.",1204796501

130456,comment,130234,130234,0,0,davidw,,,"Something like Compiere (or OFBiz) is probably going overboard for a hacker-oriented shop.  Use good tools for the stuff that's important to you, make due for stuff that's of secondary importance.  Of course... all this depends on what you do and how you want to grow.  A quick-turnaround sell it type of deal just doesn't need the overhead - indeed, PG seems to focus on not needing all that crap in the early stages of a startup, because you can just work well with the other people.",1204794525

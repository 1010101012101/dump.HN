It was really painful, because my internet would go out sporadically for at least a minute every once in a while. My problem was also too much noise coming from a crowded apartment complex.<p>The solution I found was to upgrade to a 5 GHz router. The one I bought can transmit on both 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz, but I configured it to only transmit on 5 GHz. This forces my computer to always use the 5 GHz connection, which has less noise. The 5 GHz signal decays faster when it goes through walls, so the signal will not be as strong as a 2.4 GHz would, but the signal-to-noise ratio will be much better because 5 GHz is significantly less crowded.",1423364082

They can ask developers to estimate this, but even then it will not always be accurate.<p>The crux of movements like the agile movement (and management processes like scrum within it) are to make things more process orientated - management ensures employees work for x hours a week following a process, and adapts based on what output they produce (increasing resources if they want more output).<p>Product orientated processes (where managers tell employees they have to produce y output, and after that they can slack off or go home if they want to) might work if someone&#x27;s job is to sit on a production line doing a well understood process, but it does not work well for software. I think both businesses and developers are better off for the trend to abandon such processes when it comes to software.<p>Given a process orientated environment, it is the prerogative of management to make sure everyone works as close as possible to their contracted number of hours - someone who is working less should rightly get called out on it. They may have finished their current task, but they should help someone with their task, or work on improving processes / infrastructure / addressing tech debt to make likely future work easier.<p>Not everyone needs to work the same number of hours in a process-orientated environment, but if they work less, that should be in their contract (and most likely they will get paid less than they would have if they worked longer) and not just the employee unilaterally deciding that.",1423361905

This pulse is picked up by wires that act as antenna, and you get RF interference.<p>The Xenon flash has also a distinct spectrum, but it&#x27;s essentially contained in the visible light range (in a log-frequency spectral density plot) [2], which is what you want with a lamp!

Very little is present in the Megahertz region, which is why lightening doesn&#x27;t interfere with FM radio that much.<p>Radio frequencies below the gigahertz or high megahertz region will not interfere with the Pi as the wavelength of these is too long to effectively couple into the short circuit board traces.<p>Xenon flash tubes are not that noisy in terms of unwanted RF. Apart from anything else, you wouldn&#x27;t be allowed to sell such radiating circuits in consumer equipment.<p>A xenon flash puts out an enormous amount of blackbody light (high in IR and NIR) in a very short time frame (as short as 100 ns). Plastics are not very IR blocking by themselves. Silicon has a band gap of 1.1 eV. Any photons above this energy will be absorbed across the gap, and interfere with the circuitry. Firing a xenon flash close to something will result in an instantaneous light flux many hundreds of times larger than direct sunlight. 
So the circuit might be designed to be resistant to any ambient lighting situations, but not to being flashed.<p>As a commentator mentioned below, U16 is a switched mode power supply circuit.

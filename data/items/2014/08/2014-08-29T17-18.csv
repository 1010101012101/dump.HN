Instead it&#x27;s about reducing the amount of error in the mental models we use to approximate reality.  Like, when a scientist says &quot;the Law of Gravity&quot;, they actually mean &quot;our best current guess as to how gravity works, which seems to make accurate predictions in what we consider a statistically significant number of different scenarios, but which is incomplete and perhaps even completely wrong in several other interesting scenarios or edge cases&quot;.  Only _everything_ in science has a confidence interval, and prefacing every description of some phenomena with the phrase &quot;we&#x27;re pretty sure this is how this works, but to be perfectly honest, it&#x27;s only an approximation to some X degrees of accuracy&quot; gets really exhausting, so for stuff we&#x27;re really, really sure of, like 99.9999% sure, we call it a &quot;Law&quot; (even though it isn&#x27;t) and move on with our lives.",1409335020

8243645,comment,8241251,8242970,3,0,theoh,,,"Yes. In fact there is a tradition in art theory of making a distinction between close vision (involving movement of the eye across a surface) and distant vision (in which the whole scene can be taken in at once).<p>It&#x27;s actually a fascinating bit of intellectual history, though I am not sure whether it counts as objective scientific knowledge.<p>It started with the sculptor Adolf von Hildebrand and was developed by Alois Riegl into the notions of &quot;haptic&quot; and &quot;optical&quot; vision. Wolfflin then expanded that distinction into five polarities (linear vs painterly, plane vs recession, closed vs open, multiplicity vs unity, clarity vs complexity). In mathematical terms haptic seeing is concerned purely with manifold surfaces whereas the optical can also represent non-manifold geometry.<p>Even more significance was later hung on that structure by the philosophers Walter Benjamin and Deleuze and Guattari. In particular the haptic is associated with surface, with smooth spaces of the mechanical, of trajectories and motion, while the optical is associated with volume, with striated spaces of the organic, of hierarchy and stasis. &quot;parametric&quot; vs. &quot;implicit&quot; if you like.<p>It&#x27;s a bit of a philosophical rabbit hole!",1409334929

To a photon, all of our infinite time, if it is infinite, &quot;happens&quot; all at once, so why would it matter if it took an infinite amount of it to get here.  If you could stop a photon and ask it, it would reply that we were always here.<p>Here we are having philosophical debates about it, but I suspect if we just stuck with the math -- regardless of our intuitions -- most of these kinds of arguments would turn out to be a distraction rather than a solution to the problem.

Galileo is the only other GNSS system, but it&#x27;s incomplete. Then there is the issue of different bands, and need for more complex antennas and LNAs. Most of the numbers I&#x27;ve seen for chipsets indicate that GLONASS support is still relatively unoptimized, power consumption for GLONASS acquistion is far higher than for GPS, but I&#x27;m not sure if that&#x27;s simply a poor front end for the GLONASS frequencies, or if the signal/processing is significantly different.<p>Beidou (China), QZSS (Japan/Australia) and IRNASS (India) are all regional systems with far smaller systems (3+ satellites), and in the case of IRNASS and QZSS, heavily augmented by ground based stations ().

Taking the modulus of the largest range you can leaves less residue (what lutusp is alluding to, without realizing others are describing a simple way of getting an exact uniform distribution).<p>If you want to make it more efficient (in terms of entropy used), you need to save the 1-of-prime (eg bits, trits, etc) that have been successfully chosen (uniformly). For example, with 6 children and an 8 sided die (3 bits), a roll of 6 or 7 would narrow the choices to only children 0-2 or 3-5 respectively. Your subsequent rolls could then be done with a 4 sided die.",1409332007

Zombies are a convenient standin for a constant, seething, but not largely dangerous existential threat, a backdrop against which human drama can be cast.<p>That&#x27;s the best bit of the article--especially towards the end, the author plays a few &quot;mmmm yes privileged males pandering&quot; cards and fails to critically evaluate their own claims. As an example, consider the <i>Left 4 Dead</i> series approach to zombie apocalypse: people still work together, laugh, cry, and try to make the most of things while supporting each other.<p>There is a good conversation to be had about why apocalyptic memes are so popular in fiction (interactive and otherwise) today, but the author doesn&#x27;t really <i>do</i> anything with that.

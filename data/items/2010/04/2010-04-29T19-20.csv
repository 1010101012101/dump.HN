It's at <a href=""http://banking.senate.gov/public/_files/AYO09D44_xml.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://banking.senate.gov/public/_files/AYO09D44_xml.pdf</a> and the relevant regulation is in Sec. 412.<p>It says that the Securities & exchance commission should raise the threshold, using its existing authority, <i>as the Commission determines is appropriate and in the public interest, in light of price inflation since those figures were determined;</i><p>..and in the next section, directs the Comptroller of the Currency (the banking-specific regulator) to examine those investment thresholds and evaluate the feasibility of forming a <i>self</i> regulatory organization for hedge, private equity, and VC funds.<p>Now, I recognize there's a wide spectrum of opinions on the degree to which government should regulate the financial industry. And I totally agree that angel investment is critical to small businesses like tech startups. And I agree that a million $ in assets or an annual income of $200k is already a fairly high barrier to entry, while technological change since 1982 has significantly lowered startup costs. And so, I agree that just mindlessly jacking up these thresholds would likely be a Bad Thing - for startups, angels, and the economy.<p>What I'm grumpy about is the meme that the bill does  mindlessly jack up the rates. The SEC's existing rules require public consultation on such changes - so if the bill passes, the thresholds will not suddenly shoot up. Rather, the SEC will announce they're considering it and invite input from the public - including people like us - for 3 months. And the SEC has been responsive to that input in the past. Mainly they're worried about not allowing another Bernie Madoff episode; it's entirely possible that they might employ their rulemaking power to carve out an exception for Angels and VCs.<p>And in the next section, where venture capital is explicitly mentioned, the bill directs the other regulator to study whether and how such funds - which are, obviously, quite different from banks - could be allowed to regulate themselves. the main purpose of this bill is to regulate big wall Street banks. There's a clear understanding here that small funds are <i>not</i> banks; they operate differently, are much more competitive, and probably shouldn't be regulated like banks. The bill <i>supports</i> the idea that such firms will do a better job of keeping each other honest than direct regulation by government!<p>Participants in a diverse a competitive market (for fund management) are best placed to decide what constitutes 'fair play'. Where self regulation fails is the situation where a few players utterly dominate the market - for example, the fact that 6 large banking firms currently manage about 60% of all capital on Wall Street - and tailor the rules to suit themselves, to the detriment of the smaller players, and of the customers. For that reason, the bill also seeks to put an end to the practice of large banks creating and capitalizing hedge funds that are nominally independent, but in reality are just legal vehicles for large institutions to take advantage of the lighter regulatory and disclosure requirements for hedge funds, while leveraging the reputation and deep pockets of the creating bank to attract customers away from smaller funds.<p>Why is this important? Because the SEC failed to heed warnings about fund managers like Bernie Madoff and Alan Stafford. Their competitors knew the performance of those funds was 'too good to be true' and repeatedly asked regulatory agencies to step in, but were mostly ignored. The bureaucrats' reporting requirements were being met, and they  did not understand the sheer improbability of such consistent profitability in a volatile market. Competitors did: customers preferred fairy tales to honest reporting of market behavior. Hierarchical regulation failed dismally where peer review would have put a quick stop to the abuse.<p>Result? Jittery investors lost faith in <i>all</i> private capital management and VC funding fell by almost 50% in sectors like biotech and internet from 2008-2009. Some $5 billion was taken off the table - perhaps more. Less VC funding means less angel funding: no mezzanine capital means no exit or equity partnership. You can't grow an oak tree in a one gallon pot.<p>Self-regulation of the private capital market could reinvigorate capital formation significantly. Reduced red tape and peer review are strong economic incentives for honest and transparent risk management. Investors want transparency, and they want innovation rather than speculation, in which it is all too easy to end up on the wrong side of a zero-sum trade. There is enormous potential here to deepen and diversify the investment pool, and that would be very good news for startups.<p>So as it affects Angel and VC funds, the bill does two things: directs the SEC to re-examine investment thresholds in the wake of a real financial meltdown; and directs the CotC to consider reducing government regulation of private capital management, rewarding true competition with greater trust.<p>Instead of seeing this bill as a giant monolithic gravestone for capital formation, entrepreneurs, angels and VCs should look at the potential long-term benefits and use the public consultation process to tell regulators what kind of market they need, and how an open self-policed market could unleash a wave of innovation in the real economy. The giant Wall Street banks do not like this bill, but you can worry about them when you're ready for your IPO. Until then, they won't take your calls anyway.

By almost any definition, Flash is a closed system.</i><p>This is fantastic news, direct from Steve Jobs himself, Apple is going to go completely open on their products! This means that I can go and buy a copy of iWorks from Oracle now, and get a Mac Clone from Dell and an HTC built iPhone! I wonder how long it'll be until OSX is available from Canonical? <i>so excited, so excited</i><p>Other that this, the point is almost entirely incorrect. There are plenty of authoring and playback tools for flash not made by Adobe. It isn't exactly an ""open standard"", yes, but Adobe is not the sole source of flash stuff these days. Even a cursory search on google for flash creation tools brings back a bunch. Mr. Jobs, please follow this link <a href=""http://lmgtfy.com/?q=flash+authoring+tools"" rel=""nofollow"">http://lmgtfy.com/?q=flash+authoring+tools</a><p>Other points are better made, but some are still bad:
1) HTML5 is better
2) Webkit is neato
3) Apple never said they support the full web anyways
4) Most places have HTML5 video support nowadays, except for Hulu
5) Who needs flash for games anyway, i* devices have tons.
6) Flash = bad security
7) Flash = poor performance
8) Flash = eats batteries
9) Flash doesn't work great with touch
10) Third party content development tools suck! The people who use them suck! The crap that comes out of them sucks too! Anybody who think differently was born wrong!
11) Adobe should be making HTML5 authoring tools anyways.<p>What Apple should do is put Flash through the exact same approval process it puts other apps through. Make Adobe work for it, but don't just simply cut it off like a tantrum throwing child that can't share. If these are the problems with Flash, kick it back with comments and force Adobe to fix brokeness to get approval through the store. Adobe being open or not being open is a garbage point as I noted above. Apple doesn't require any of the apps in the app store to be open standards compliant. The mechanism for dealing with all of these problems is already there and it's simple -- the app store. There's no need to ""work with Adobe"", just reject it from the store the same way lots of apps are rejected after the screening process. Lots of apps eat batteries. Is that a new rejection criteria, ""apps may not consume battery life.""? If I want to run down my device in 5 hours instead of 10, that seems to be my problem.<p>1) HTML5 is still very very immature technology with almost no good toolchain support for authoring HTML apps. It's still a pile of languages glued together in a browser that sometimes makes something useful or interesting, but also really really processor intensive and slow. We all ooh and aah, everytime we see a canvas demo that eats up 100% CPU time on a quad core system displaying something that we all saw in 1996! By just this simple test, points 7-8 are almost completely invalid. Does flash perform worse than native apps and use more battery? Sure! So does playing an intensive game!<p>2) Webkit <i>is</i> neato, but webkit is a different thing than Flash. It makes no sense to compare the two. It's like comparing webkit and iworks for the iPad. By this logic, Apple should also not sell iWorks for those devices but just point everybody to Google Docs.<p>3) That's okay, that's why there are 3rd parties who can build stuff to support it for you.<p>4) Good point. This is definitely the wave of the future, Hulu needs to catch up. The point about hardware decoding is also fair I think.<p>5) i* devices do have tons of games true (Steve, I hope you now see the connection between entertainment software and platform sales, it's eluded you on the Mac for years). But those games are not flash games. I want to play flash games on my i* device. Period. I am the consumer, and I get to demand what I want to purchase. The only fair point I think is that most flash games don't work well via a touch interface. I have to agree with this. But there are also plenty of flash apps that are not games that would be amazing on an iPad. I want to use those. <a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1295052"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1295052</a> And no bit of HTML5 will replace these kinds of things for at least 12-24 months. Flash is not just about video and games.<p>The i* platforms also do not have the most pieces of entertainment software of any platform. Apple needs to simply stop exaggerating their claims to the point of absurdity.<p>6,7,8) see point about app store rejection above.<p>9) Agreed, though some flash apps might work well. Or apps could be written to work well with it <i>exactly</i> the same as making an HTML5 canvas app work well with the i* devices. This BS about mouseover events, and device features is also true of the web, yet that doesn't seem to be a reason to yank Safari mobile off of the devices.<p>10) This is the most noticeable pile of utter garbage in this entire thing. Somebody here did a survey of the top i* device apps and many of them were made with third party tools or contained elements that are now in violation of the new terms. Most of those apps were of superior quality. Just because the tool chain is made by somebody else does not mean the output will suck. Conversely, just because the toolchain is Apple approved, does not mean that all apps that use that toolcahin are going to be free of suckage. There are lots of shitty apps in the app store, <i>lots</i>, and I'd bet the vast majority of them were written with the approved toolchain.<p>11) I think we can all agree that HTML5 is immature as a technology. Adobe makes great authoring tools. Therefore, Adobe should make great HTML5 authoring tools.  I think we can all agree on this. Flash <i>is</i> eventually going to go away. But in the meantime it's still a useful piece of technology. Just because quartz timing devices will all eventually go away doesn't mean that we should just stop using quartz timing devices. But even if Adobe started today, flash would be a predominant force on the web for 3-5 years.<p>Finally, this is all a giant pile of misdirection. Point 10 is the key one not flash.",1272569169

To those, like RMS, who want the open/closed heuristic used globally and without considering any other variables, this is hypocritical - you say you support openness in one area, but not another. To the people that care about end-user experience more than open/closed systems, such hypocrisy is just common sense.<p>Personally, I think we should strive for cooperation between the ""pure morality"" point of view of Stallman, and from the ""practical morality"" point of view of industry. I've been both a paying member of the FSF and a big fan of the Apple's ecosystem of products since high school: the two are free to pursue their own goals independently, and work together to the fullest extent that shareholder interests align with open-source morality.<p>A great example such a beautifully aligned interest is Google's rumored opening of the VP8 codec - it will both save Google oodles of bandwidth and storage in the long-run, and be great step for the open ecosystem. It's also important to remember, however, that the <i>reason</i> On2 was able to get investors to pay for the development of VP8 is because of the IP protections they received.

It's hard to claim that it's a ""marketing trick to pull the wool over the eyes of consumers"" when you agree with large tracts of the author's argument.<p>Their main point, that he's somehow a hypocrite because Apple haven't used the latest tech for everything, entirely misses the point he's making - Putting a 3rd party layer between your platform and developers can cause a lag in new features being used. He then states he's mostly worried that Adobe would have really amplified this lag, as ""Adobe has been painfully slow to adopt enhancements to Apple’s platforms"". He doesn't say it's bad that they've been this slow, just that they <i>are</i> this slow. If it takes them 10 years to adopt Cocoa, why would anything in iPhone 4.0 turn up in Flash till 2015? His claim is that middleware lag is a bad thing is not weakened by iTunes for Windows being crappy - if anything, it's strengthened.<p>He makes his position very clear - ""we sell more devices because we have the best apps"", and feels they get the best apps without middleware. There's nothing inconsistent with this position, whilst still taking advantage of other platforms lack of restrictions. I'm not even going to deal with the authors claim that h.264 is as proprietary as Flash: A standard that was developed by a committee, in the open, with many implementations and a licensing scheme for anyone, versus a commercial closed product developed by a single company and no competitive implementations?

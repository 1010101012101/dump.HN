BTW, ASP doesn't really 'look' like anything, since it's just an environment for the actual languages (vbScript, ECMAScript, C#, whathaveyou) that drive the server side.<p>I wish I didn't know that.",1178865654
21263,comment,21227,21236,0,0,machine,,,"The answer to your first question is no.  For example if you wanted to search for ""What did Al Gore say?"", a google wild card search for ""Al Gore said wildcard"" (the markup won't let me put an asterisk) would not match things like ""blah, said Al Gore"" or ""he said blah"" where he is referring to Al Gore, or ""Al Gore told someone blah"".  For the search engine to match those results, some level of parsing is needed.",1178865365

-- referring to #6 ""a Lisper can run rings around a C programmer"". <p>Now, before you flame me, I'm not attacking Lisp. I simply think that the framework and tools available to you are more important than the language you choose. A Lisper is going nowhere if he doesn't have good third-party tools and has to build everything from scratch.",1178865063
21261,comment,21153,21248,0,0,vegashacker,,,"I think we're actually pretty much in agreement, just with a slightly different conclusion.  If a lot of these ""funny image"" posts started cropping up, that would not be good (and maybe that's reason enough to nix this puppy?), but I'd never seen anything like this bag of chocolates, and it got a chuckle out of me, so I gave it the upvote.  Programming languages prose... definitely more pertinent.<p>You're right, the picture might not have to do webapps.  I think I was imagining those square brackets were the result of some ASP gone astray, but I don't actually know what ASP looks like, so why would I assume that?<p>Now I'm going to downvote myself and go to bed.",1178863982

Currently, a non-technical user who knows html and web development (or has a designer on staff) can use your software or other open source software to create one magazine issue, and then they get stuck. You need to know objective-c to add Newsstand, and its not very intuitive on how it's set up. You also have to host the files yourself.<p>What I think small publishers would pay for is code that automatically sets that up for them. For example, something that generates the html that sets up a Newstand page inside the app, and then allows me to enter my information (where my files are stored, price, etc) and then shows me where to insert it into the code (or does it for me). All I would need to do would be to upload my issues to my website. \nBasically, help people sell their magazines, and people will pay you for it.<p>Feel free to PM me if you have any questions about the issues we have been having.",1326833820

But not to single Agile out unfairly: Although people are doing a lot of great work researching processes and so on, Software Development as an industry is like this.<p>Consider Waterfall. If you try it, and it doesnt work, proponents will tell you that you were doing it wrong with all the changes late in a project. If you try Ruby and your code is a mess, Ruby programmers will say it isnt the language, you failed to write good Ruby code.<p>And so on, ad infinitum.<p>So, if I agree with you, why did I post this? Not because I assert that Agile will work if you just do it right, but that I think its wrong to modify it and then blame it for not working.<p>Come to think of it, if you do it right and then succeed, I also think its wrong to give it the credit.

As far as I've understood Blank's customer development model, it can be described as below.<p>Founders have a strong vision of a problem and product, but they don't necessarily know who are their best customers. Basically, they are unsure of their business model and target market. They get some funding and start developing the product (traditional 90s bubble model) but at the same time they start visiting and talking to customers, showing mockups, trying out different price points etc. (Blank's customer development model). There is parallel tech & customer development going on.<p>Note that under Blank's model pivoting doesn't mean that you start to execute on a totally different product, but that you adjust your product vision when you learn more about customers and possible target markets.<p>As an example, you start with a vision of cashflow estimation software for small 10-employee consulting companies (founders' vision, a self-identified need), but when you start selling and learning about markets, you noticed that bigger companies (let's say 100 employees or so) have similar problem. But what those bigger companies need from user interface and database integration are quite different than needs of small companies. However, this new target market is more profitable, so you adjust your product vision and business model to serve it instead of the original vision.<p>This is how I've understood customer development model.<p>Founders have a vision, start building product and finding a target market and scalable business model for that vision. It doesn't mean desperate random attempts in totally different products.",1326832657

The problem is that this requires self-reflective and humble individuals who are willing to work on improving their skills. I see far too many who are not willing to improve and learn, and most of these individuals lurk at big companies. Such an individual sees only imposed constraints in the methodology, and no possibilities. Since these passive individuals are easy to control, management has formed as a constraint-imposer and controller above them. Introduce a new methodology, and the workers will only (rightfully) complain while the management translates it into control constraints. So the problem lies not within the process, but the individuals.

I left the army in 2010, and started freelancing, where I got tired of dealing with low-budget clients and working from home. Serendipitously (or so I thought at the time), I found a position at the director level with a local agency, where I was able to make some immediate improvements to both operations and the bottom line, but eventually ran into a lot of resistance going any further. I also reached the point where I could no longer do all of the work on my own and we needed to reach out and hire people. It sounds great, but the assets at my disposal are simply not enough to make a compelling offer to applicants, thus I find myself in an ongoing battle with deadlines and the people that set them.<p>To make a long story short, I told my boss that I felt undervalued and that because of certain archaic processes, we were not as efficient and profitable as I thought we could become. Let's just say that the conversation didn't go my way.<p>So I find myself in a pickle. There are solvable problems that don't want to be solved, and I'm not getting paid enough to solve them. However, I'm not the kind to just take a paycheck and call it a day (like many of you I imagine).<p>The only way I can improve my situation is by leaving my job, which I plan on doing. The problem is that I feel guilty about it, almost like I'm giving up or not doing all I could to resolve these conflicts. The boss has a 5 year plan, but I'm not keen on waiting 5 years...I don't have the time.<p>My question to you is whether any of you have been in similar situations, and if so, what action did you take? Did you regret moving on, or did you regret staying too long?<p>Of course, I'm building on the side, but the projects aren't making quite enough money yet for me to outright quit.

When they say they 'add value', what they mean is copy editing, archiving, distribution, etc. They include in this peer-reviewing the manuscript, but in reality that is done for free by scientists whose salaries are again, mostly paid for by public funds.",1326830608

If you make it readable in part and download in priority (first pages first, obviously), you might only have to seed >0.1% of the estimated bandwidth usage to get everyone with full books.<p>Actually this would be an amazing way to distribute a game too. If the client is built into the game launcher, simply have the client only download the core and the mandatory tutorial. If someone goes down a certain quest path you prioritize the later portions of the quest before continuing the download of the other quests. You could also prioritize associated quests and follow on quests because you know people will complete them.",1326830469

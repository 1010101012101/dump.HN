They require a ton of bootstrapping to get anywhere. That's because you end up with a trading system that's looks like a foreign exchange market with 7 billion different floating currencies. And that's assuming only individuals have them, excluding corporations. You'll notice old cypherpunks have a lot of skepticism toward the fiat-currency arguments against bitcoin. We've been trying to make fiat-currencies work. Keeping the rep net up to date is at least as expensive as mining bitcoins, but with none of the hard-crypto backing to the algorithms. And it's way more opaque. That's ideal if you're trying to soften shocks across a national economy. It's less ideal if you've got more self-serving interests than eyes.<p>Bitcoin isn't perfect. But we can test it, and if it breaks, we'll see quickly. Broken rep-net economies are like building markets on pyramid schemes: people have an incentive to pretend it still works until the damage is orders of magnitude larger than the economy proper.<p>And I encourage you to investigate what fractional reserve banking looked like in the days of specie-backed-currency. Banks still made loans and kept less than the entire value of their demand accounts on hand. It'll be weird, but there will be an M2 and an M1 in bitcoin, we aren't technically limited to an M0 money supply.",1306194683

2578049,comment,2577095,2577095,43,0,grellas,,,"A few thoughts:<p>1. Nothing in the letter commits Apple to defend the developers or to hold them harmless. Legally, Apple does not have to do this. One can only hope that its self-interest in protecting its app-store ecosystem will be enough to cause it to do what is right. For now, Apple is saying only that it will fully defend its ""license rights."" One can read more into this than is stated but that is all that is stated (of course, Apple's throwing its weight behind developers even at this level is no small thing).<p>2. The letter does not quote the license agreement in any way. Normally, if there is something definitive in such a document, it is put front and center in a letter of this type. This could mean that the license language is not as definitive as the tone of this letter might suggest. Only time, and a detailed review of the license language itself, will tell on this point.<p>3. It is plain that Apple wants to do the right thing for its developers. Yet the situation is trickier than that. As of now, Apple has no legal obligation to defend or hold them harmless, and that step is an order of magnitude greater than that of saying it will merely defend its license rights - and hence the hedging in the letter.<p>If the goal of the patent system is to promote innovation, then this case is Exhibit A for how it is failing. Thousands of patents are gathered up in a portfolio held by an IV affiliate and licensed in bulk (""monetized"") to big players such as Apple, Microsoft, Google, etc., who in turn believe that they have clear rights to build systems around them. But the patents are ""monetized"" again to lesser players with shadowy relations to the original IV group, who in their turn try to ""monetize"" them further by attempting to double-dip with the original licensees based on limitations in the original licensing language. At each step, threats of lawsuits abound and nowhere can one find even one example of a patent developed by a company for its own innovative uses. Instead, we have the equivalent of shadowy trafficking in intangibles that are now being used, not to encourage innovation, but to attack the very developers who are <i>trying</i> to innovate.

Basically, I want all my cards dealt to a startup rather than half of them since the other half is dealt to my current career. You may ask why I can't just jump straight into the startup and the answer to that is, because I'm repaying loans (private/federal) and paying bills.

The original legislation focused on affiliate marketers as the nexus. Illinois just recently passed a law targeting affiliates for this as well.<p>What happens however is the merchants end their relationship with affiliates in the affected state. The law is not designed to be enforced because the wording makes it impossible to truly determine if an affiliate in the state was involved. The end result is affiliates leave the state or are cancelled by the merchant.<p>What makes this law beyond the pale is the attempt to define nexus as almost any manner of electronic represenation or presence. If you have an ecommerce company and are not in CA, but your web host has your files in a CDN in the state, you get to collect sales tax -- on any transaction involving the CDN server in CA. Pretty much a technical hurdle no one can cross. It goes further by making the definition so broad that the CA board of equalizaion can determine that nexus exists at any time for any reason.<p>So yeah, hope that helps.

You need to watch them use your competitor's sites.  You need to  watch them use sites that come up in conversations about your products.  You do not need hundreds of people to make a difference.  Get people off craigslist and other classifieds for $25 and have everyone that touches the product watch them use it (as video, after the fact).  This input is hugely valuable.  Metrics are also very important.  If a button is on a page in three places, track which one they click.  Measure response times, page flows, all that good stuff (although be wary of blindly conflating marketing success with usability).<p>If these are the lessons you've learned from Neilsen, I can only say I'm surprised because I see his work as the opposite approach.  Perhaps because I've seen him cited so often over the years by people who don't think they need to do this because they think Neilsen already answered that question.  Nobody I know that actually embraces this kind of hands-on testing has any respect for his ""studies"".<p>What I'm trying to say is don't try and distill universal rules from this narrowly-scoped input.  Don't ask a small number of people about a small number of experiences that have no logical connection, and try to infer some wisdom from it that you can apply to another group of people in another experience that may not be at all similar.  I've had a case where adding clearer text to a vaguely worded button killed performance.  Others where making a button look considerably ""worse"" improved success dramatically.  Sometimes you need to make the font bigger, or add an icon, or remove an icon, or have a popup, or add two pages to your wizard, or not even have a wizard, or whatever.  Sometimes you need to do things the wrong way because you lose from inconsistency what you gained from local quality improvements.

Our It head was also a gym teacher.<p>>>When you manage services locally - i.e. desktop/laptops with directory services, file&print, email handled internally, YOU (that is, IT) decides what users can do. They can stop users from installing random Apps, or visitng porn/non-educational sites, and do things like prevent students from printing war and peace fifty times just for giggles.<p>Well apps are a nonissue since it is chromeos, and only has one app. I thought I had heard of filtering options for enterprise/education customers but I can't find the article saying so. Acting on the assumption that it would be filterable, are there any other objections<p>>>Sounds like your school needs new IT staff, not an external provider. Incompetent staff will f*ck up anything they're given.<p>Completely agreed, as I said the head was also the gym teacher. I am sure everyone would love to have a better system in place, but it is not economically viable on he budget given.

I'm not sure how this applies to people, especially since balanced people can bring a fresh perspective to things (i.e. a programmer with some creative background might approach a problem in new and interesting ways).<p>Without arguing the efficacy of the TigerMom approach, this is indeed why a lot of parents force their kids to do something - you may not have a knack for it at first and be tempted to write off that it just isn't for you, but you need to put in a little more time to really figure out what your true learning curve for something looks like.<p>One interesting question is whether you really love doing something or just love doing it because you had a knack for it initially and picked it up quickly (which results in a positive feedback loop: you spend more time on it and get even better at it compared to the things that you didn't have a knack for at first).

Briefly, your body starts out with the B-cell that produces the good antibody, and randomly mutates the critical regions of the antibody gene, generating a large population of B-cells that each produce slightly different antibodies. The B-cells with the best antibodies (highest affinity for the antigen) are selected and given the ""do not die"" signal. The rest of the B-cells do not receive this signal and self-destruct. The end result is a population of B-cells that produce higher-affinity antibodies than the original. Repeat while ill.<p>I may misremember some of the details, but that's the gist. Your body basically generates antibodies via an evolutionary algorithm. Wikipedia has a good explanation.

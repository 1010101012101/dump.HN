That requires some kind of trail that leads to the safe. A court won't just automatically force you to open your safe and potentially incriminate yourself; but they also will not allow you to use a safe to hide your murder weapon if all evidence points to you having stored it there.<p>In the case of cryptography, if the contents are bad enough to put you in prison for a zillion years, obviously you have to make a judgment call as to the punishment if you refuse a court order to decrypt the contents. Since this is still such a relatively new gray area, I'd say a court would still blaze its own path (not depend primarily on prior precedent) in deciding if you're to be compelled.

We're OK with it not being for everybody as long as we can find a big enough niche.<p>Regarding the pricing, we charge $99 for the initial design. However, if the customer wants any additional versions they are $5/version not $10. Obviously if someone is creating a new version of their resume for 100 different positions, it wouldn't be financially feasible for them. However, if they are targeting $5 companies, I don't think spending $20 extra is a huge hurdle to overcome, particularly if you think of the resume as an investment. If it can give you a better chance of getting noticed, it can be the difference of making an $9/hour at Starbucks or $60,000/year in an ad agency.

A mob of peasants protesting the color of the flag is unlikely to get him to change anything. That's the point I was trying to make - Tumblr is the king, and is unlikely to change their tune dramatically, and thus, little risk of this new policy creating ever more new ones.<p>Is it desirable to have this much power in one place? Maybe. Maybe not. But whether or not this is a desirable or fair system is quite separate from whether or not this system is easily susceptible to slippery slope attacks.<p>Keep in mind that Tumblr is also not almighty here. Tumblr rules over a kingdom where people can emigrate effortlessly. It may not be democratic, but this presents a natural check on its power.<p>> <i>""Or I guess I feel that increasing the number of people that have influence on the decision decreases the chances of their being something ""arbitrary"".""</i><p>I think this is where our philosophies diverge. The more cooks in the kitchen, the more arbitrary the meal is going to be, as each one is out to craft <i>their</i> perfect meal.<p>This might be ok if every person has <i>equal</i> influence on the decision, maybe (cue argument about tyranny of the majority, etc), but in a community-driven voice-driven case, it's less about community consensus and more about which tiny minority can rally the strongest army.",1330045999

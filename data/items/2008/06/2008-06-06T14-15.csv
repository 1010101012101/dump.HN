210867,comment,208736,210830,0,0,Tichy,,,"Can't go into detail, short of time. However, the blog post you linked to was NOT an example of discussion about GW. I don't think it was meant as a contribution to the discussion - it does not contain any scientific arguments to argue about. So your remark ""don't look like the arguments characteristic of correct theories"" is completely out of place - it was never meant to be that (I suppose).<p>Criticizing the ""argument tactics"" is just ""ad hominem"". Surely you could find lots of examples for Anti-GW folks arguing in a away you find inappropriate. It does not prove anything. What are you trying to say, Anti-GW people are nice people and GW-people are rude, therefore we should believe the Anti-GW? I highly doubt such a generalization, sorry. You write ""that doesn't excuse invalid arguments ""on the correct side"" - sorry, that is complete nonsense, as we are talking about individuals, not about organizations. How could individual A be responsible for what individual B is saying, even if they appear to be on the same side? It is impossible, they can not censor each other. For all I know, some Antio-GW people could be posing as rude GW people to give GW a bad name (it is a standard tactic in warfare, agent provocateur).<p>On the other hand, yes, McIntyre's stuff LOOKS impressive, but it could also be compete nonsense, for all I know. For somebody who does not know anything about the subject, the ""detailed"" mountains presented by creationists might also LOOK impressive, but to someone in the know they might immediately be recognizable as irrelevant.<p>""Either failing could be used as a starting point for a complete rewrite, building something intellectually honest over the rubble of Myers' indignation""<p>What rubble? Myers did not present any arguments for GW in that article, so there is no rubble. I am also not sure that GW defendants should be obliged to deal with McIntyre's theories, if they are convinced that they are irrelevant (I can not judge that, I have no idea). It could just be a major waste of time.<p>I remember when I read all those books about evolution theory, like Dawkins. Half of the books were dedicated to refuting useless creationst claims, and I kept thinking for myself: the evolutionists wasted so much time over this, they should have just skipped over it and dedicated that time to advancing their theories. It could just be a tactic by Anti-GWs to seed lots of irrelevant ""problems"" to distract GW proponents from their main cause.",1212763703

210844,comment,210427,210671,0,0,KirinDave,,,"I have a few answers for you:<p>When a master node dies, all the worker nodes go into a hibernation state, pinging the master's previous hostname until they can reconnect to that host, and then they reregister their resources with the master's resource_fountain.<p>One of the next major features for fuzed is handling the master as a single point of failure. We're exploring two options currently:<p>1. When a master dies the cluster can re-elect a new master on one of the machines in the cloud and everyone re-registers their assets. This process assumes that master death is relatively rare, and so minimizes the resources necessary for redundant operation at the cost of a slight time gap in service while the master is re-elected and resources are re-registered to it.<p>2. Clusters can create numerous masters which all maintain identical state. When one dies, another master will move forward and become the primary master. This approach requires more hardware in the cloud, but even if the master faults are common they don't allow for a gap of service.<p>As for the difference between process death and machine death, yes there are differences. If you're interested in how we handle it, please check out master_beater.erl (great name, huh?), which is a gen_fsm that worker nodes use to eagerly reconnect to the master. Also check out the fuzed.ap and fuzed_supervisor.erl. Erlang provides very good resources for handling this.",1212762153

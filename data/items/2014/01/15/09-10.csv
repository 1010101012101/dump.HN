Your application either sets the flag in its manifest, or calls `SetProcessDpiAwareness` function.<p>> In Windows (I&#x27;m talking about the old native-code API here - no idea about Windows.Forms or WPF), when you say &quot;draw me a 1px wide line here&quot;, you get a 1px physical line drawn.<p>No. The default (ie if you are not claiming to be DPI aware) is that your draws end up on a 96DPI &quot;virtualized&quot; surface, which is then scaled up by the compositor (DWM) to the real DPI. Effectively that means that your 1px line becomes 2px line. You can only draw real 1px lines on hidpi screens if you claim to be DPI aware.<p>This article documents the behavior quite extensively: <a href""http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/dn469266%28v=vs.85%29.asp"" rel""nofollo"">http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/dn46...</a>",1389779238

Instead, it is an absolutely royal pain.<p>For one, you can&#x27;t just throw hires bitmaps into a resource section of .exe and expect them to magically work. There needs to be code that looks at current DPI and picks matching bitmap.<p>For two, standard DPI levels are 96, 120, 144 and 192, but guess what? All other values in between and above 192 are game too. In fact, there&#x27;s a nice little slider in the Control Panel that <i>encourages</i> you to put it somewhere in between. This means that your code either needs to rescale bitmaps to match these odd DPIs or use the largest one that fits. In either case the result will look like butt.<p>For three - the dialog layout. If your dialogs have text that&#x27;s longer than 3-4 words, the chances are that it will either overflow, underflow or wrap differently under different DPIs. This in turn means that you need to test dialog appearance with at least 4 different font sizes <i>and</i> Tahoma 8px for Windows XP. Do you know how hard it is to word a longish sentence so that it would fill about the same space with all 5 combinations? Really damn hard and very time consuming.<p>But wait!

For instance, the following code:<p><pre><code>    function asmjs(i) {\n        i = i|0;\n        return (i + 1)|0;\n    }\n</code></pre>\nis valid javascript, and you can easily write this in your own programs.

A bit of self deprecating humor goes a long way here. &quot;Ha-ha! I&#x27;m so terrible at this!&quot; or even a more sincere &quot;I&#x27;m terrified of public speaking so I forgot what I was going to say next!&quot; usually elicits a laugh and sympathy. No one is natural at this, and most people don&#x27;t practice it at all, and they don&#x27;t want to. They get it.<p>- Following that, the only notes you should have are &quot;checkpoints&quot; as I like to call them. A 3 or 4 word phrase about what you&#x27;re going to talk about in the next 30 seconds. If you forget, you fall back to the checkpoint, realize what you were talking about, keep going. An outline, if you will. Don&#x27;t ever have &quot;notes&quot; that have exact wording in them. No! Disallow yourself to memorize wording, because that&#x27;s how you lock up and forget. Instead, make sure you can explain each checkpoint yourself, to a friend. The wording will be different each time, and that&#x27;s fine. You want that. It makes it more organic and gets you out of robot-recital-mode and puts you in ad-lib-i&#x27;m-good-at-this mode.<p>- While you&#x27;re presenting, it feels like you&#x27;re in warp speed. Things are happening so fast, and you&#x27;re responding to them so fast. I suspect it&#x27;s the adrenaline. Once in a while, you forget what you were going to say, or you think you&#x27;re spending too much time thinking about an answer. Then you watch yourself on video and you realise it was only 2 seconds.<p>Even Michael Bay could have recovered from that by saying &quot;wow, major brain fart!&quot;, and people would be commenting on how sincere he is. And if he hadn&#x27;t memorized some impressive sounding bollocks word for word, and instead had a message to convey, he&#x27;d recover from that soon after.<p>If it&#x27;s not just the presentation heebie-jeebies and you think you legitimately have crippling social / performance anxiety, you should try one of the many great programs out there that help you with that. In the Boston area, MGH has an entire center dedicated for that, I believe.<p>These basically help you develop those skills in a safe sandbox, until you get better and more confident, and let you go step by step.<p>There is no reason you can&#x27;t try the same approach, if you think you can do it. Present at a small 10 person user group for your favorite obscure programming tool that you&#x27;re passionate about. If there isn&#x27;t one, start one! That way you can&#x27;t avoid public speaking, and you know you&#x27;re in good company.<p>Finally, re: Q&A: If you don&#x27;t know the answer, say that you don&#x27;t know! If you are thinking, think out loud so it&#x27;s not boring and awkward for the audience. Both of these I see in tech presentations a lot.",1389776998

They probably noticed that it will never work out, so they opted to go for a hack:<p>With the exact quadrupling of the resolution, we got a solution that works mostly transparently for the applications. They still think they are drawing with a one-pixel resolution, so the burden of getting this right moved from the app makers to the OS maker.<p>Even if an application has no modifications for retina displays, it will look mostly right (minus some blurring issues for pixel art). There will be no scaling issues, no texts will be cropped and everything will be scaled by the same factor.<p>If you want to &#x27;optimize&#x27; your app for retina, all you do is provide higher resolution bitmaps and you&#x27;re mostly fine.<p>The exception is some text-editors (sublime) and browsers (chrome) that were doing some manual text rendering, not relying on the OS API. These had to be fixed manually, but there really weren&#x27;t that many applications like that.<p>Yes, the way Windows does it is probably more &quot;purist&quot;. Yes, the way Windows does it allows for arbitrary scaling factors (also sub 200%).<p>But it <i>doesn&#x27;t work</i> in practice.<p>Yes. The Apple solution is a hack. Yes, it doesn&#x27;t allow scaling to arbitrary factors. Yes, providing 2x bitmaps instead of one vector image is annoying.<p>But it works in practice.<p>On a retina mac, you&#x27;d never see the issues the OP complained about seeing on their Windows machine. What you get there might be superior from a technical standpoint, but it all boils down to an ugly half-working mess because developers just <i>don&#x27;t bother</i> to get it right.<p>I&#x27;m not excluding myself here. I&#x27;ve done a few windows apps and I f&#x27;ed up high dpi modes as many times as everybody else - also because my development environment (Delphi) made some assumptions that just didn&#x27;t work well with high-dpi modes.<p>Getting HDPI right on Windows (Desktop): Really hard and thus not worth it for most developers.

Rust code uses these pointers in all but the most trivial code, so they&#x27;ll be showing up a lot; in contrast, I suspect as a non-C# programmer that <i>ref</i> and <i>out</i> are not as widely used in most C# codebases as ~ and & are in Rust. There are also not that many sigils, all told—three sigils for pointers plus a few other operators that appear in this table.<p>Additionally, this table is different from the tables of Scala dispatch operators, Perl operators, &c because of its regularity—it has two axes and a good deal of the information presented is a straightforward function of a cell&#x27;s position in the table[1]. For example, the entry in the <i>Owned</i> column and the <i>String</i> row is going to be an... owned string, which is going to be prefixed with ~ (like every cell in the <i>Owned</i> column) and have a base type of <i>str</i> (like every cell in the <i>String</i> row).

Some of that irregularity comes from arguably expected consequences of Rust semantics (e.g. of <i>course</i> you can&#x27;t have a bare string, because you can only have bare values whose sizes are known in advance, and you don&#x27;t know how long a string will be) while some is genuinely arbitrary, like the syntactic sugar for functions.",1389776422

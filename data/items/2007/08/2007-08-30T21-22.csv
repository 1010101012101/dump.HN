But when I began talking to folks in the rest of the business world it became apparent that those benefits were out-weighed by the negatives for a tech company that plans to be acquired or go IPO.<p>Just incorporate in Delaware, and don't worry about it.",1188510688

WiFi just doesnt work as reliably as wireline solutions.  <p>Here in NYC, I cannot even use my own wifi network from more than 15 feet away because, the entire spectrum is getting stomped on from everyone else around me.<p>If your main goal is blowing away tax dollars to consultants, municipal wifi is awesome. If you just want to connect to the internet get an EVDO card.

48461,comment,48294,48330,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"I'm on my second startup.  My first was a ""failure"" by some definitions of failure (it paid the bills, bought me a 350Z, and worked me nearly to death for seven years...it never really stopped being a service business despite my attempts to convince myself that I was selling products--I consider it a failure, but I learned a lot).<p>""Wisdom and exhaustion in equal parts, I'd suspect, and only one side is going to win.""<p>Agreed.  I'm just stubborn enough to keep trying.  I'm also lucky enough to have a fantastic business partner, which I didn't have the first time around (I should have brought him on back then...he was already doing contract work for me on a regular basis).<p>This time around I put much tighter time constraints on myself.  I'm not giving myself 7 years to figure out if I have a failure on my hands.  Every 6 months I evaluate where we are, and if I don't see clearly how to get to the next level, it's time for a serious change.  So far, that hasn't happened...wisdom gained from the previous startup seems to have allowed me to avoid most pitfalls.",1188510208
48460,comment,48294,48327,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"You need to get to a startup hub, if you're serious.  It makes a huge difference in mindset, and odds of success.<p>I've started companies in Houston, Austin, and now in the Valley.  Austin was vastly better than Houston, but Silicon Valley is worlds apart from anything I've ever seen.<p>The only benefit to not being in a startup hub is that you don't have as short of a runway during that very early self-funded stage.  You can live on peanuts in most parts of the country...but in the valley you will go broke fast if you don't have income or funding.  So, it seems like ""not dying"" would be easier in places where the cost of living is very low, but I think it's probably a zombie-like existence.  You also don't have to move as fast...and if you aren't moving fast at 3 months into your company, you're as good as dead.",1188509908

48457,comment,48294,48418,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"""People concentrate way too much on success stories without looking at the failure stories.""<p>By what definition of ""too much""?  I see nothing wrong with focusing on studying the best--the ones that made it.  Those are the people to emulate.  Why spend your limited time studying the ones that failed?  Sure, learning from mistakes is great.  But I suspect I'm going to weather the storm better if I learn about mistakes from people who made it through to the other side--rather than from people who blew it and ended up bankrupt.  I really don't think I'd like to be facing a problem and thinking, ""Oh, wait, I read about this...it turned out horribly...we're dead!""  Much better to think, ""Well, Evan Williams had exactly this problem with Blogger.  And look how that turned out!  Just gotta keep plugging away.""<p>Just a thought.  I don't really think we need a lot of post-mortems while we're in the early stages.  Maybe later when we have a huge success on our hands and want to know how to avoid becoming the next SGI (Google uses SGI internally to mean, ""company that has huge success and then made huge mistakes"", because Google has actually moved into nearly all of the old SGI buildings in Mountain View as SGI has atrophied into a shell of itself--seeing how business and management heavy Google has become in the past year makes me think they didn't think hard enough about SGI...).",1188509657

As far as how it is written, I would argue that the phoned-in and impulsive nature is what makes this essay so elegant. It is clean and concise, stating the idea simply: dont give up.

48454,comment,48294,48328,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"""I'm not sure you realise just how scary the thought of failing in front of so many hard-working people is...""<p>Failure has a different meaning in Silicon Valley (kind of).  There have been a couple of quiet fizzle outs from WFP that I'm sure of, and I've spoken to two of the guys from those fizzle outs since then...one is working on new ideas, and another has moved to another company (perhaps the most flexible of the bunch, in that they changed their entire business model and started from scratch during the program) from the same program that raised some money and he's happy and enthusiastic.  While there is a bit of averting of the gaze when I asked how things were going, the fact that they were there at a YC event and talking about new things tells me they will probably go on to great things.<p>It's the folks who went back home, went back to consulting or school, who aren't going to be among the winners in the end.  Which comes back to pg's assertion that just by staying in touch and staying involved you could very well guarantee success...I'm not sure if it's the cause or the effect, but I do think the folks who've stuck around and keep coming to the events and keep in touch with other YC'ers will probably do well.",1188509263

48452,comment,48284,48284,0,0,waleedka,,,"JavaScript in a browser doesn't give you enough low-level access to manipulate images. A good compromise is to build the UI in javascript, and have the image processing on the server. Then, use AJAX to give the user a nice and quick experience that feels as if the processing is happening on the client. Of course, you won't have as dynamic a behavior as if it's all on the client, but that's probably the closest you can get with JavaScript. Other options include using a JavaApplet that runs on the client, or a .NET component (IE on Win only).",1188508965

Paul McKellar's first run was SocialMoth.com which is fun as hell to use and crazy sticky...but got no traction and no investment.  Next came Overhear.us.  Also fun to use, but no traction and no investment.  Then came the Facebook SocialMoth, which exploded...now he's a mini-mogul with a bunch of Facebook apps in development, and real revenues from those users.  Is he rich yet?  Probably not.  But he's found a niche that is paying and growing rapidly, because he stubbornly kept iterating and evolving.

Primarily, I wanted to have the freedom to use that trait parameter type as a building block for other types if I wished to.<p>See e.g. my &#x27;Graph&#x27; implementation.[1] In it, I pass in the type of the vertex as a trait type parameter &#x27;A&#x27;. In the &#x27;Graph[A]&#x27; trait I also have an abstract type &#x27;E&#x27; to represent the edge. &#x27;E&#x27; is used in a couple of the methods.<p>Later I define a more specialised &#x27;MapGraph&#x27; trait and refine the type &#x27;E&#x27; to be a pair of &#x27;A&#x27;s. I couldn&#x27;t have done this if I wasn&#x27;t passing in the &#x27;A&#x27; as a type parameter.<p>This leads me to believe that all things considered you get more flexibility from always using type parameters, not to mention somewhat better signal-to-noise in the code (getting rid of all the method type params), and also being able to use &#x27;val&#x27;s.<p>[1] <a href=""https://github.com/yawaramin/scala-modules/blob/8df0ec516629b6293a08311805796a0bd78bbc17/Modules.scala#L8"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/yawaramin/scala-modules/blob/8df0ec516629...</a>",1428202916

If you like what you see, you merge it. Virtually no effort needed.<p>And the database in form of the repository has complete history and is easily replicated or moved, by design.

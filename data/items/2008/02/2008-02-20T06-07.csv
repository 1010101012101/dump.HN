119511,comment,119451,119451,0,0,secorp,,,"We've had success outsourcing some of our non-core activities in our shop (4 p2p hackers working on distributed storage). For example, we've outsourced our website implementation and our Facebook app. Though any one of us could do them, it was much more efficient to draw up a set of screenshots and functional goals along with our API and then get back to working on our core project.<p>One key success factor is to find a high quality group to work with. We used recommendations, but I've also seen a few 2-person shops use oDesk find people for prototypes of applications they didn't have time/interest to build. The prices are extremely competitive, and often you can hire 3 people and use the best result.",1203490281

119509,comment,119451,119451,0,0,white,,,"Let me clear my point.  Speaking about outsourcing, I was talking about offshore development, outside US.<p>Well, still, a lot of startups are always looking for someone, either programmer, or designer, or database developer, etc.  There are also a lot of single founders.  To start a startup one man is not enough.  Even if you are a hacker, it's always nice to have one more hacker.<p>Here is my point: a lot of startups are looking for someone to join them for a tiny salary plus huge chunk of equity.  So why wouldn't they consider outsources, using the same amount of money, they may not give any equity at all or just a small piece of it.<p>kingnothing: you sound to me like you think that outsourcers require more money, than local people.  Did I get you wrong?<p>mercurio: I'm not talking about corporate level outsourcing, B2B.  I'm talking about using power of freelancers.  They still stay below the US market rates.",1203490111

The major expansion binge which created hockey teams where they, to be frank, had <i>no business being</i>, watered down the product by spreading talent thinly and damn near killed the sport in the US (it will probably never die in Canada no matter what happens).<p>In the same vein, most of the country never had a housing crunch like the Bay Area and metro Boston, but home building has been consistently outstripping the economy.  Population grows at 0.9% annually, or about 2.7 million people per year; From 2000-2006, the net increase in housing units was 9.0% over the whole span, or 1.4% per year.

I remember giving them a try a long tim eago, only thing is I remember them inserting their brand into the message. I didn't particularly want that.<p>Also, speaking of Teleflip... I've heard people speculate how they're able to find the correct provider. Anyone know? Initially sending the message to all providers and then seeing which one doesn't bounce back seems spammy, but who knows.

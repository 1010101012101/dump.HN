No need to grow slow... unless slow growth is what you want.  $6k is not the difference between high growth and slow growth.<p>",1176274605
11754,comment,11754,9770,0,0,abhilashgp,,,"I don't think its valid, saying, that all applications will be deployed off the web; that would be very wrong. The fact that Google docs hasn't really clicked just points to the fact that certain software makes sense to be offline. One reason why; user sometimes wants to be very close to his data.<p>The key to the future i believe is the right mix of offline and online capabilities in applications. Microsoft has been kind of late in putting offline capabilities to many of its products. But that doesn't mean they are dead; they have the resources and ability to create paradigm shifts in this business. The fact that a person like Ray Ozzie (who is more or less associated with network computing and collaboration) is now overlooking the software giant's product teams also sends indications that Microsoft will start looking into the online/offline match. Infact the concept of ""internet services disrupted"", term coined by Ray Ozzie in a recent talk, precisely shows the direction in which Microsoft is headed.

I went to that site and saw a blog with a animated matrix background.  I didn't get it. <p>I know it sucks to be rejected (went thru it recently myself)  but don't fall into the trap of sour grapes.  <p>Find out what you can do better, or improve on.<p>And I think this is probably a good forum for doing that.",1176274547

All the benefits of your own box with far less hassle and only $20pm starting fee.  Loads of really good documentation on getting a production RoR environment up and running too.  They're probably the best bet for bootstrapers and students.

I probably won't have time for side-projects while I'm there, but even if I don't get rich with them I'll probably walk away with enough savings to set out on my own afterwards.",1176273162

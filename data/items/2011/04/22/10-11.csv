I also have a nightly cron job run and rotate backups of the most critical databases to an external drive on my home network. A Tonido Plug does that job (Ubuntu on a tiny ARM server in a plug that costs virtually nothing to run).<p>Now, some of the databases are simply too large or under too much load to take a live backup while the sites are running. Those I run on Amazon RDS with the MultiAZ feature enabled. \nThere should be two copies of the database running at all times, both servers keeping a 3 day binlog for point-in-time backups, and making a nightly snapshot to S3. I have to rely on Amazon for that.<p>But I still take daily home backups of the most valuable individual tables off those servers, like user registrations and payment records.

2473716,comment,2473544,2473631,3,0,nikreiman,,,"I'm also a developer in Stockholm, but originally from the US. Looking at my taxes from last year, I guess that I also made a similar amount before taxes, and most of my friends earn similar amounts. After taxes this would come out to about $50K.<p>Previously, I worked in Germany and I earned about the same amount (before taxes), probably a bit more afterwards. However, you can't and shouldn't compare the dollar amounts directly.<p>First of all, the taxes are higher (especially in Sweden), but you get more out of them. Health care, for instance, is excellent and is completely taken care of, whereas this is usually calculated as a ""benefit"" in the US. It's not uncommon for Americans to get shafted on the health insurance or to have to pay it themselves if they are independent contractors. Also, vacations benefits here are also very ample compared to the US. Five weeks per year is standard in Sweden, most professionals get six.<p>Also, I don't need to own a car here. That saves a ton of money, time, and mental health. I bike/walk/take public transport everywhere here. This is only possible in a handful of American cities, of which I have never personally lived in.<p>Stockholm is expensive, but the quality of life here is worth it. I consider myself very lucky to earn as much as I do, and I enjoy the life that I have here, which you can't put a price on.",1303469527

In order to get a smooth rotozoomer effect you have to use a technique called block rendering. This means you divide the image in square cells and render these one by one. Because the pixels in the cell are always near eachother you can reduce cache misses.

2473667,comment,2473351,2473567,5,0,cdavid,,,"Those are very conventional mathematics, and most core concepts have been settled for a century now. Cantor in particular paved the way toward a better understanding of many related concepts in that area.<p>As for the significance of those differences: I can think about two areas where this is fundamental (but there are many more). First, the natural numbers (0, 1, ...) vs rationals vs real numbers is really big in terms of ""how many"" numbers you have. You can prove than the set of natural numbers and the set of rational numbers is roughy the same size (they are both countable). Now, as you may know, there are some irrational numbers, like square root (2), pi, e, etc... But how many ? The answer is ""many more than rationals"". One way to define the real numbers (rationals + irrationals) is as limits of a set of rational numbers - i.e. for any real number, you can find a set of rationals which get arbitrarily close to an irrational (we say that rational numbers are dense for the set of real numbers).<p>Another field where you see the difference: topology vs probability. Roughly speaking, probability is a function which for a set gives you a number between 0 and 1. The key property of probability is that P(A U B U ....) = P(A) + P(B) + ... where A, B, ... are disjoint sets. Another way to look at it is that probability is a special case of the notion of set measure, which is the mathematical way of talking about volume, length, etc... There is a key restriction when defining measure, that is you cannot take arbitrary unions of sets, like say as many as real numbers - actually, you can prove that you <i>cannot</i> build measures if you want arbitrary (uncoutable) unions. This is a naive way to describe the Banach-Tarski paradox, which says that you can split a ball into two new balls which are identitical to the original one.",1303466782

But there's probably also something else going on, whether it's me, my essay, or the audience.<p>If anyone has any ideas/pointers, I'd love to hear them.",1303466532

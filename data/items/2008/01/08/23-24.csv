This has inspired me to move forward with this. To those who have done stuff like this before, thanks for the links and I'm grateful for you sharing your experience.<p>If its OK I'd like to let people know about my experiences. Oh, if anyone is interested in collaborating or just sharing ideas then I'd be happy to do likewise<p>All the best",1199835590

It's even used in medicine, and if you do some google searches you'll see the term mentioned on all the most important medicine journals worldwide. For people who works on psychiatry, neurology, etc. that's no secret at all.<p>There is plenty of info on its wikipedia's page too if you are curious about it.",1199834998

Here are some search terms that will likely help you:<p>* automatic wrapper generation<p>* information extraction<p>* removing noisy information from Web pages<p>* template detection<p>* wrapper induction<p>""Wrapper"" is a fancy computer-science term for ""scraper.""<p>I wrote some Python code that does this -- given X sample documents, detect the differences between them and automatically create a scraper tailored to those documents. I released the first version open source -- it's called templatemaker: <a href=""http://code.google.com/p/templatemaker/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://code.google.com/p/templatemaker/</a> .<p>But that version of templatemaker is quite brittle, because it was designed to work on plain text as much as on HTML. I've since written an HTML-aware version of templatemaker that is really frikkin' awesome (if I may say!) and beats the pants off the old one. I don't know if I'm going to open-source it, as it's quite valuable to my own startup.<p>Hope this helps!",1199834808

4568299,comment,4567735,4568168,5,0,dkarl,,,"Eh, I wouldn't call what 4chan does ""trolling.""  They get their lulz by hurting people, both to prove they can do it and just to enjoy inflicting pain.  They usually want their victims to know exactly what's happening, who's doing it, and why.<p>I hope trolling doesn't come to mean any kind of maliciousness, because it won't enrich the language much for it to take on such a broad meaning.  Thanks to human nature, we already have a pretty comprehensive vocabulary for obnoxious behavior.  Trolling in the narrow sense is a handy addition for a behavior that has emerged as an everyday fact of life in the internet age, but trolling used in the broad sense is usually a lazy replacement for a better expression.<p>Edit/PS:  To be clear, what 4chan does is bullying.  Harassment, spreading embarrassing information, vandalism, insults, reputational attacks:  there is nothing novel about this pattern of behavior.  In second grade (the early '80s) my entire elementary school was taken out of class so we could watch a short film about bullying.  If I remember correctly, a kid was bullied until one day he fell over dead because he didn't want to live anymore.  Cheesy, but it shows that 4chan's methods and intentions aren't new and don't merit a new name.  The only novelty is that the bullies' unashamed voice has been added to the conversation, so now we know they do it for the lulz.  (Which is what everyone assumed about bullies anyway until someone invented the idea that bullies were abused and miserable themselves, which became the new conventional wisdom until it was challenged recently, and now I think even the touchy-feely types think it's really all about the lulz.  But I digress.)",1348541567

4568253,comment,4567562,4567562,6,0,masterponomo,,,"Wow. I think back to when I first tried to go out as a contractor. A headhunter got me an interview with a local telecom. During the interview, the manager asked me if I was one of the people named in a recent ComputerWorld article about families with multiple generations in IT. I said I was. He said the whole staff of the telecom IT were curious as to why everyone in the article had given their salary, but I had not. I told him it was because I had merely filled out a questionnaire before I found out the reporter was going to write a nationwide article, and that I subsequently declined to reveal my salary to the world. The manager asked how that went down. I told him not very well--the reporter dunned me to find out my salary, sent me a disposable camera with instructions to send him a photo of myself for the article (I also declined that honor). I told the manager I was a private person and had not consented for my image and my salary to be plastered in a magazine. Then I tried to steer it back to IT, and mentioned that I had recently started using Linux (this was 1998, when that was a daring thing for a mainframer to have done). He said, ""Oh, you're one of those Unix guys? We hate that sh<i>t!"" So, no fab whiskey, no dogs, no hotel, not pool and air hockey--just a quiz about an article I had tried not to be in, and a curse for liking Linux. </i>sigh<i>",1348540866

We quickly found out that, at least with the dozen or so geospatial data providers we contacted at the time, the data we wanted was simply not available in the West (if it even existed at all)! The rumor in the industry was that the Chinese government didn't want accurate map data to leave the country for fear that it would be used for military planning purposes by invading powers.<p>All was almost a disaster until a co-worker returned from a year in Beijing and brought a small stack of locally produced paper maps of the city back with him, with careful notes where they were ""not accurate"". We kept 4 or 5 interns busy for a summer converting the various paper maps into digital vector data we were able to use with our GIS systems.<p>So the fact that less than a generation later, people are complaining that the iOS maps lack sufficient detail of the countryside or whatever is almost mindboggling to me.<p>On a similar note, recent travels in Seoul have also reminded me how bad our GPS systems are no matter the provider.

Like any other such arrangement, it pays to price based on what your contribution is worth to the client, which will ideally be much more than what it costs you to provide it.",1348539842

This causes an error which might cause a cascade of errors meaning that some other parts of your job either fail to run or run incorrectly.<p>Now what happens here, do you get notified of the error or does it just get silently eaten? It's also very possible that your system will eat the error and then proceed to the next step (calling this API) and everything will appear fine.<p>One thing I figure out what the expected output from the job should be, I then pipe the output from the cronjob into a file. I have a second cronjob that checks the contents of this file periodically and generates an alert if it does not match what is expected.<p>You should also try and find some way to test any generated data. For example if you are doing a DB backup, add another table with a field that contains data that is in some way based on the date. You can then have a task which will try and restore old backups into another DB, it can then check this field against the expected value for the date of the backup.<p>Of course none of these techniques are silver bullets and there are plenty of things that can go wrong, it is certainly prudent to check things manually every once in a while.<p>Perhaps this API could be modified to take as an input the output from scheduled tasks and check them?",1348539834

So exceptions are a poor fit.<p>You're quite right that exceptions promote giving up control to a higher level. And that's the right thing to do for exceptional situations. The ultimate higher level is the programmer who's going to have to fix the bug, or the admin who needs to fix the configuration problem - because they are the two main classes of errors for which exceptions are great. (The third class is a logical abort, and depending on the language and how good its idioms support exceptions, this may or may not be good practice.)<p>You get rich information about the error, including a call stack, the ongoing operation gets cancelled as soon as it occurs rather than muddling onwards and causing more damage. If you can foresee the error such that you can write an error handler, using the method that throws exceptions is probably not the right one - unless it's unavoidable owing to race conditions, or impoverished libraries.",1348538448

So, 10^12 password attempts per second. An attacker, who is <i>not</i> a nation state, should be expected to have access to maybe 400 such systems.

I agree with you with regard to the fact that every DSL is a language &quot;per se&quot; that needs to be learned and so it amplifies a language syntax weight but, in general, IMHO a static language &quot;readability&quot; is better than a dynamic one&#x27;s.<p>Since Python is a dynamically typed language its function signatures do not say much. Take, for example, the following Python definition:<p>def append(xs, x):\n    ...<p>By reading this function signature you can&#x27;t say anything about it. What are the parameter types? What does it return? Or, does it actually return anything at all?  Same reasoning about Ruby being itself dynamic as well.<p>Now consider the same example in Scala:<p>def append[T](xs: List[T], x: T): List[T] = ...<p>Just by reading the signature you can say many things, such as this method takes a list of some type T and a value of type T and returns a list of type T.<p>I&#x27;m not dissing dynamically typed languages here. I understand there are situations where a dynamic language may be the best choice. What I&#x27;m saying is that when it comes to &quot;readability&quot; a static language wins over a dynamic one in terms of pieces of information given just by reading function signatures.<p>I&#x27;ve already read Martin&#x27;s book and found it brilliant. Thank you for the hint anyway.<p>Cheers",1427543831

9281102,comment,9280058,9280058,0,0,dgeb,,,"As a co-author of JSON API, I&#x27;d like to address the value proposition of the specification.<p>First of all, JSON API provides guidance for a lot of API design decisions that are usually contentious because, although they may <i>seem</i> trivial, they must be made with care in order to be consistent and viable. For instance, JSON API provides guidance for:<p>* fetching related resources together with primary resources in order to minimize requests<p>* limiting the fields included in a response document in order to minimize payload size<p>* paginating data with links that work well with any pagination strategy (page-based, offset-based, and cursor-based)<p>* sorting results, even potentially based on related resource fields<p>* representing heterogeneous collections and polymorphic relationships<p>* representing errors<p>In my opinion, some of the most useful guidance is related to the representation of relationships, which can include:<p>* embedded linkage data which &quot;links&quot; primary resources with related resources in a compound document.<p>* relationship URLs which can retrieve linkage data and directly manipulate the relationship without affecting the underlying resources.<p>* related resource URLs which can retrieve related resources themselves.<p>In addition, JSON API supports extensions and has official extensions for performing bulk updates and JSON Patch operations. These particular extensions provide extremely useful mechanisms for transactionally working with multiple resources.<p>All of this guidance has been forged over the course of two years based on the feedback and contributions of hundreds of developers. Even if you were to incorporate some of this guidance in your APIs piecemeal, it would probably save your team many hours of design discussions.<p>However, the bigger value proposition of JSON API is just now beginning to be realized. Since we&#x27;ve tightened the &quot;spec&quot; into a proper <i>spec</i> by eliminating many MAYs and SHOULDs, it is now possible to reliably build implementations with a guarantee of compatibility. It&#x27;s regrettable that it took us so long to move from providing loose guidelines to a more rigid spec, but I truly believe that the awkward intermediate phase provided invaluable feedback that ultimately informed the design of the spec and will improve adoption of 1.0.<p>We are seeing client libraries being built in JavaScript, iOS, and Ruby, and server libraries in PHP, Node.js, Ruby, Python, Go, and .NET. Although not all are (yet) compliant with the latest changes to the spec, we are tracking progress carefully as the spec nears 1.0 to ensure that we smooth over any rough spots encountered by implementors. I&#x27;m personally involved in developing Orbit.js and JSONAPI::Resources, both of which are nearing JSON API compliance.<p>I can say that it&#x27;s incredibly satisfying to build applications with compatible client and server libraries. It lets me focus on the design of my application&#x27;s domain instead of myriad details related to transforming data representations and protocol usage. Even better is the knowledge that other clients can easily use my API and all of its advanced features, regardless of their language and framework. This is ultimately the promise of JSON API, and it won&#x27;t be long before it&#x27;s realized.",1427541099

Seneff suggests that gut bacteria effects are only seen at around the 4 month or later mark in humans, but says every official study has been 3 months or less because they only examined it for toxicity.<p>There are a lot of take down articles claiming she is a quack, but none I&#x27;ve seen that really call into question the science of what she claims. Most take down articles accuse her of working too far outside her field, as if her BS in biophysics followed by her several advanced degrees shows her unable to gather research in biology. Some people think her claims about autism and glyphosate prove she is not worth listening to, but I disagree that a scientist who does original research should be broadly ignored because a subset of their claims are hard to swallow. Even if the autism connection is false, there are many other issues.<p>She points out that glyphosate use has grown exponentially in the last 15 years since it went out of patent, and runoff from glyphosate (which kills plants) is causing real harm to our ecosystems. She also says they have new harvest techniques where they just spray the poison on wheat crops before harvest. It kills the wheat but I guess makes harvest easier. So if her claims are correct, your food could have been directly sprayed with this stuff right before it was taken from the farm to the factory. She then points out that until recently no studies of glyphosate occurrence in food have been done, nor had any studies of glyphosate in humans been done. A recent study found something like a third of european food and a fifth of europeans to have measurable levels of glyphosate in their urine.<p>So there&#x27;s this chemical that everyone swears up and down is SO SAFE that we don&#x27;t even need to study it. Meanwhile we have a clearly brilliant woman who makes a compelling case that spraying this stuff left, right and center on our food may be a bad idea.<p>I do not think the people who say &quot;we shouldn&#x27;t look into it&quot; have a leg to stand on. Seneff may not be right, but the ONLY way to know is to examine her claims and prove or disprove them. We should examine the data she presents in the youtube talk linked above and try to see if her claims hold water.<p>If you disagree with me or know more than me, that&#x27;s fine.

Only a handful of MIDI controllers have ever supported <i>polyphonic</i> aftertouch, where the aftertouch value is applied per-note. On conventional keyboard mechanisms, this is extremely expensive, because each key requires a separate pressure sensor rather than simply measuring pressure across the whole keybed.<p>The LinnStrument also supports polyphonic pitch bend, which is even rarer than poly AT. Due to the limitations of the MIDI protocol, polyphonic pitch bend requires note-per-channel support, which is available on less than a dozen software instruments.<p>The only mass-market controller that is remotely comparable in expressiveness is the Keith McMillen QuNexus, but this is a much less musically useful product with only a two-octave range.

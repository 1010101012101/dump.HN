Here's the copy of the email I just sent his office: I'll try and contact his office by phone tomorrow.<p><pre><code>  Hello,\n\n  It's been with great pleasure that I've been able to watch Representa-\n  tive Issa speak out against SOPA in the Judiciary.\n\n  However, I'm concerned at seeing him offer ""H.R.3699 -- Research Works\n  Act"" as such an act is a major blow to scientific openness.\n\n  As you may well be aware, in many nations it's a requirement that re-\n  search receiving federal funds (i.e. research at taxpayer expense) be \n  made available for free to the public. The recent policy proposal by \n  the NIH would move the US towards a similarly open policy and would \n  help foster the openness of research that made this country such a \n  leader in science and technology for so long.\n\n  Unfortunately, companies like Elsevier have increasingly treated pub-\n  lishing as a private cash cow, banking (in part) on the burgeoning \n  costs of a university education to widen its coffers. The journals \n  published by Elsevier cost colleges and universities millions of \n  dollars each year and burden students with growing debt (and for \n  others, preclude the possibility of higher education at all).\n\n  I ask that Representative Issa revisit his stand on this issue. \n  Thank you.</code></pre>",1326779762

It's a bootstrapped business that's profitable, but barely, so I didn't have a lot to spend.  However, I needed to get the LLC in place relatively quickly (days, not weeks or months) to sign a contract.  Here's some of the schleping involved:<p>- Creating the LLC itself sucks/is expensive.  I ended up using Legal Zoom to create the LLC because California's government is so understaffed that they're weeks and weeks behind on processing LLC paperwork, so the only way to get your stuff processed quickly is to have a courier walk it into the office by hand, in addition to paying all sorts of expediting feeds.  I think I ended up paying Legal Zoom $900, in addition to the $800 franchise tax, etc.<p>- Figuring out how taxes works sucks.  I'm a sole founder, and have only offshore contractors, no employees.  It should be really simple.  But I honestly still don't have a solid idea how I should be paying myself, what paperwork I should be filing for taxes, and what witholding and estimate payments I should be doing.<p>- Setting up proper accounting sucks.  I used quickbooks to run a small freelance business 10 years ago, but I suspect there's something better out there that's web based.  I'd really like to just be able to hand accounting and taxes off to someone who knows more about it than me, but I don't know where to go about finding someone, and am worried they'd cost more than I could afford.<p>- Figuring out how to get healthcare as a bootstrapped small business sucks.  I'm on COBRA right now, but once that runs out, I have no idea what my gameplan is.  This is separate from the suckage that is healthcare in general once you have it.<p>These are all things that are necessary to start a business, but at least for me, none of them are fun, or really increase the value of my business.

You're making a donation, not buying something. For that donation you are often promised a reward, but you are not guaranteed one.<p>There is a certain amount of risk associated with backing a project on kickstarter. Projects don't always turn out the way you hope. Budget issues, design flaws, etc, are all par for the course.<p>I've backed a number of projects now. I just checked, and I've backed 15 projects out of which 9 have received funding ($346 pledged, $284 charged) since August 2011. So far I have only received two items.<p>I hope to receive all the items I've funded, but I know that even with the best intentions, not every project will be able to deliver.<p>Since you believed you were ""purchasing"" items, perhaps kickstarter needs to do a better job of making it clear that what you are doing is making a donation, and the whole thing is running on the honor system.

I'm a huge fan of the model, and have enjoyed both the items I've received so far. You can always give them for xmas next year :)",1326778531

Plus the pay is really quite terrible.<p>3) working in-house at big companies is a route that's pretty much closed unless you're lateraling over from BIGLAW (a route now closed to me due to the way legal hiring works) or have some kinda nepotistic connection (which I don't have).<p>4) I'm not too much of an outlier in my situation. Lots of people in my class that I talk to privately are looking for work. The school tries to put a smiley face on the situation, but privately they'll tell you in your second year that if you miss the boat getting a job at on campus interview with a big firm, your short term private sector prospects are in the $20/hr range, which wouldn't be bad if you were coming straight out of college, but, with law school debt, it's pretty awful. It's bad out there, even near the top of the law school pyramid.",1326777172

3473833,comment,3473360,3473360,12,0,nirvana,,,"I got burned by a kickstarter project.  Like others, I naively believed that they were at least an above board outfit.  I also appreciated that Amazon was the payments service because I believe they are above board as well.<p>I fell for the ""Hexbright Flashlight"" project:\n<a href=""http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/527051507/hexbright-an-open-source-light?ref=live"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/527051507/hexbright-an-o...</a><p>His pitch was that the product was designed and that he just needed the funding to underwrite manufacturing startup costs with asian and local suppliers.  Having been well down the path of getting a consumer electronics product manufactured, and knowing the costs and understanding that a lot of those costs are upfront, I this seemed very reasonable to me.  I thought his asking amount was a bit low, but the project was overfunded to the tune of $800,000 - more than enough to cover these startup costs.<p>Once funded, however, the October delivery date-- two months from the funding date, was never mentioned again.<p>Instead the updates have increasingly focused on design choices. In fact, the early updates made it very clear that many of the design choices hadn't even been settled!<p>He's clearly taking his time, doing some updates once a month or so, but it doesn't even look like this is full time. (excuses for having a new baby, etc. Jeez guy, you took on an $800,000 project with a baby on the way, really?)<p>I have the very strong impression that it was a slight con job-- he got the money to dick around with his ultimate flashlight and ""really do it right"", but doesn't seem too concerned about his commitment to deliver the flashlights in a timely manner.<p>I do believe has has every intention to deliver these flashlights... eventually.<p>But I bought them for christmas presents, I've been out several hundred dollars for 6 months and I don't even have a promise date for delivery.   In fact, the whole thing is so half assed that he doesn't even know which colors I want because he didn't give us a way to tell him.<p>So, I contacted Kickstarter.  I figured they had contingency plans for this kind of situation.  I figured they were a standup organization.  Their response?  A form letter telling me that they advise their project leaders to deliver in a timely manner to backers.  That's it.  No suggestions for alternatives, nothing like that.<p>Of course the 30 day credit card dispute period has long passed.  But I don't think it will come to that.<p>The FTC has a rule, that if you take money for a product, you have to deliver it in 6 weeks.  This is why TV commercials and magazine ads often say ""delivers in 4-6 weeks"".   Because they're using drop shippers, or whatever.   If you don't deliver in 6 weeks, you have to get the customers permission to delay shipment, or you have to refund their money. Thems the rules.<p>Its debatable whether the 6 weeks started at the funding date when our cards were charged (and kickstarter got their $80,000), or at the ""end of october"" when they were originally supposed to ship. Either way that time is up.<p>Because I think this guy intends to deliver them, and was only dishonest about the level of completion of the project, and because I know that last %10 can take a lot of time, I'm going to give him a bit longer.  Maybe the end of January.  I'd go to the end of February if he promises to ship in that month.<p>After that point, I'm going to take up the dispute with Amazon.   I expect that amazon, having handled the payment will resolve the issue, but if they don't then I'm going to escalate.<p>I actually blame kickstarter more than I do the guy behind the project.  They should not blow people off when projects fail to deliver.  This isn't a donation to some kid who wants to take pictures of trees in the Sierras.  They are selling products here, and they are promising tangible goods on a specified date in exchange for the funds.  That's the definition of being a store.<p>I don't mind giving people some time. I only even got annoyed about this one after christmas came and went and there wasn't even an apology for not shipping in a reasonable amount of time.  And I only got upset when kickstarter blew me off when I wrote them.   Because of that, if this isn't resolved in 4-8 weeks, I'm going to Amazon, and then the police.<p>Needless to say, I won't be backing any more Kickstarter projects, and until they start taking some responsibility, I no longer consider them a trustworthy outfit.<p>Here's the introduction of the project:\n""I am offering pre-orders for two unique and powerful lights, the HexBright Prime for $35 and the HexBright Flex for $60. Both models are virtually identical looking with an ergonomic, very comfortable grip and use the best available LED light source. ... The major difference between the Prime and Flex models is the HexBright Flex is USB rechargeable and USB programmable. If you want, you can re-write the default code and tweak the HexBright Flex however you desire.""<p>He's offering pre-orders.  That's what the project promised. (Elsewhere it gave a ""late september, early october"" ship date, but that has since been removed.)<p>Kickstarter offers a FAQ.  Here's the FAQ entry for this project:\nWhen will you ship?\n""Short answer- as soon as we can. Long answer- HexBright is not a product already on the shelf ready to be shipped. You are funding development of a top quality product where almost all your money is going into the parts and materials with almost no overhead, marketing or middlemen costs (we are projecting future retail prices to be over $100). As the saying goes, ""CHEAP, FAST, GOOD, pick any two"". Our price is fixed so we are choosing between ""fast"" and ""good"". Good wins every time. ""<p>The thing is, this FAQ was changed.  Kickstarter helpfully tells us so:<p>Last updated: Monday Nov 14, 1:22pm EST<p>So, during the time he was asking for money, we were given the opportunity to ""pre-order"" these flashlights that are described as already existing:<p>""the HexBright Flex is USB rechargeable and USB programmable.""<p>NOT:\n""the HexBright Flex WILL BE USB rechargeable and WILL BE USB programmable.""<p>Then, about 2 months after he was supposed to ship, the FAQ changes to ""You are funding development of...""<p>So, the project says one thing, but the FAQ says another, and the wording on the FAQ, updated 2 months after it should have started shipping, implies that people who expected it to ship when promised weren't actually promised a shipping product on any specific date.",1326777046

3473828,comment,3470876,3471399,2,0,3pt14159,,,"> Should it happen everywhere?<p>Yes. The market has spoken. People find terms of use acceptable, which includes looking at personal data. The alternative is to restrict your data team to the point where conversions would be half or a third of what they are. Are most people willing to pay triple just to remove the off chance that some random data guy comes across their info? Probably not.<p>> As a data guy, do you have professional obligations to uphold the privacy policy and operate within the law?<p>Any person, employee or not, professional or not, has obligations to uphold just laws; certainly including measures of privacy.<p>Here is a typical privacy policy:<p>""We use personal information in the file we maintain about you, and other information we obtain from your current and past activities on the Site, to provide to you the services offered by the Site; resolve service and billing disputes; troubleshoot problems; bill any amounts due from you; measure consumer interest in our products and services, inform you about online and offline offers, products, services, events and updates; deliver information to you that, in some cases, is relevant to your interests, such as product news; customize your experience; detect and protect us against error, fraud and other criminal activity; enforce our Terms of Use; provide you with system or administrative messages, and as otherwise described to you at the time of collection. On occasion we use email address or other contact information to contact our Users to ask them for their input on our services, and to forward to them media opportunities.<p>We may also use personal information about you to improve our marketing and promotional efforts, to analyze Site usage, to improve our content and product offerings, and to customize the Site's content, layout, and services. These uses improve the Site and better tailor it to meet your needs, so as to provide you with a smooth, efficient, safe and customized experience while using the Site.""<p>That bottom paragraph is fully communicating the nature of the relationship. Outside any law that would render the above unlawful, it is well within the law for an employee to ""SELECT * FROM users WHERE created_at > 2010-02-01"" or to ""SELECT * FROM todos JOIN users ON todos.user_id = users.id WHERE users.profession = 'developer'"". There are perfectly valid reasons to do these types of things. Anti-fraud measures, site optimization, etc.<p>> What are the mechanisms available to the market and the industry to prevent the deterioration of customers' trust with us?<p>This is a problem of mismatched expectations and priorities. It's a lot like politics. In an ideal world a politician would be able to say something like 'I think the American people acted irresponsibly financing homes and that is a good part of the reason for the financial crisis' because it is the truth and it would help people in the long run to hear it, as well as help any policy formation in response to it. But practically they can blame others and get away with it.<p>Unless the industry is willing to educate politicians, site users, etc. There is no reason to go out shouting that this happens. It's already in the terms of use and the privacy policy. Do you think people <i>want</i> to know what Air Miles does with their data?<p>The only mechanism besides general silence (as well as inclusion in the privacy policy and/or terms of use) would be full, 100% truth when asked. But why make an issue of it? The netizens don't really care. If they did there would be competition around this angle of the market.<p>dhh hides behind: ""I don't think it has to be this way. We often run internal reports on usage of certain features, but it's always aggregated, and never looks at the individual data. I feel bad enough looking at a customer's account when they've specifically asked me to do so from a support request.<p>I would certainly terminate any account with a company that willfully was reading my private data and opening files for the mere sport of it.""<p>That carefully worded bullshit. Internal reports are not exploring. Internal reports are what you show at the monthly marketing or board meeting. C_Os get internal reports. Data guys test recommendation models. Data guys find out the interesting patterns to include in custom reports.<p>Also, His last paragraph is ridiculous. Obviously we don't read data for sport. In fact it is boring.

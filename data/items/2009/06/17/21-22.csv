662551,comment,662149,662149,0,0,CWuestefeld,,,"The amount of global warming we're experiencing is still a matter of debate, and certainly the specific climatic responses are mostly unknown. One day it's ""we'll see increased hurricane activity due to global warming"", and then it's 180 degrees around to saying that hurricane activity will decrease.<p>My point isn't to deny global warming, but to show that we don't really understand very well how climate works. We may be on a deadend path right now. But people who want a radical change -- whether it's one of the suggestions in this article, or simply an enormous decline in CO2 emissions -- may turn us off that dead end, but they do so by closing their eyes and hitting the gas pedal simultaneously. Nobody <i>really</i> knows where we'd wind up.<p>The article points out that the effects may be uneven. But I think it's worse than that.<p>Returning CO2 levels to historic lows, or blocking solar radiation, might not be able to return the system to its original state: these reactions may not be reversible. Our environment has many factors that keep us at equilibrium, and many of these things have been working diligently to take up slack. Why should we think that these things will simply unwind back to their original state?",1245275711

This isn't about NC wanting to collect sales taxes on purchases made by buyers in NC.  And while Associates are involved, they're not involved in the purchase at all.  They simply forward traffic to Amazon and if the customer buys, they get a commission.  This is completely different from a retail store that's holding inventory from vendors and handling the actual transactions with customers.  This is quite literally just like hearing about something from someone.  If I live in NC and I send an affiliate link to a friend who lives in NY for a book on Amazon and that friend purchases it, NC is claiming they're owed sales tax on that sale.

North Dakota, requires a business have a physical presence or “nexus” in a state in order for the state to compel that business to collect and remit sales taxes. AB 178 represented an attempt to circumvent the federal interstate commerce law by presuming that a company has a physical nexus if business is solicited through a third-party advertiser that is based in California.""<p>April 28th: \n""However, a bit of rare good news for California taxpayers came out of Sacramento yesterday. Just as the bill was scheduled for consideration, the Assembly Committee on Revenue & Taxation voted to remove AB 178 from the docket, effectively taking this odious piece of legislation off the table, at least for this year.""<p><a href=""http://www.atr.org/california-amazon-tax-bill-dies-quick-a3170"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.atr.org/california-amazon-tax-bill-dies-quick-a31...</a>",1245272670

The author's website suggests he is a Marxist -- I don't know if that means state socialist or anarchist in this case, but if it's the former, he would probably disagree with me.",1245272644

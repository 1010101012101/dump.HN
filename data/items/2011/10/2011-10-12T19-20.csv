I feel sorry for those who read the post as if the author is knowledgable about this subject matter.  Picture the IT manager or CIO who reads that and thinks their continued investment in Java as the ""one language to rule them all"" was a good decision.  That person would be better served reading Steve Yegge's platform rant from earlier today.<p>No one language is equally great at solving every foreseeable problem.

They buy the seeds on the condition that they will not reuse them. Full stop.

I ended up absolutely hating it, to the point where I would drive into work every day with tears in my eyes.<p>The problem was, I was young and had absolutely no idea what I wanted to do, so I didn't even know where to apply. So I ended up spending all my free time focusing on things I was passionate about. I wanted to be healthy, so I cooked and worked out and got healthy. I also loved traveling and seeing and learning new things. So every weekend, I tried something new. I was in DC at the time, so I got to see all the plantations and went sky diving and learned skiing and went on a hot-air ballon ride and a lot more! Every weekend, I would do something I was passionate about. And none of these things were in any way related to my work.<p>Now, a few years later, I am working on a start-up with some new friends that focused on making it easier for others to get out and see and try new things.<p>So my advice is this. You're 20, so you probably have no idea what that one thing you're passionate about is. There are probably a few things that you're passionate about, so pursue them. They don't have to be related to anything you're ""working"" on at all. If you're passionate about traveling or meeting people or playing a sport or playing guitar or anything else, pursue it.

We all know of the sweatshops run by companies like Walmart and Nike, lots of people even complain loudly, but those companies seem to be doing very well, year after year.<p>On the other hand, given the size of Monsanto, there is no doubt that Cloudant could effectively demonstrate their expertise, and use them as a case study for landing big customers in future.  Plus, the money must be pretty good.<p>I guess it isn't our job to judge Cloudant, they are running a business - their business, their choice (moral or not).

3104251,comment,3103763,3104053,4,0,Symmetry,,,"I've heard that the main problem is that they don't really have the expertise and manpower anymore to do a full custom design, but are using a more ASIC style process - influenced by the ATI folks.  Also, this is an all-new architecture and so you'd expect that it would be unpolished and untuned.  Intel hasn't done anything as drastic as what AMD has done here since the introduction of the Pentium Pro.  Well, there was the Atom but Bobcat (also an all new design) is able to beat that the same way that Intel is beating AMD at the high end.<p>In theory, this will let AMD mix and match components easily, and quickly synthesize new designs with the right mix of Bulldozer cores, Bobcat cores, GPU cores, memeory controllers, etc to meet market demand.  I haven't seen any evidence that this is actually happening, though, or that its worth the price.  By contrast, Intel has huge design teams that can afford to hand tune a range of designs to changing circumstances.<p>Its also true that though GF has a more tolerant set of design rules in its 32nm process, it pays for it in lower overall performance compared to Intel's process at the same node.<p>I'm not sure the high frequency design was a kiss of death.  In terms of pipelining it doesn't seem any more aggressive than the Power7, which has been very successful.  The Power7 benefits from 4-way SMT, though, and that probably helps hide the cache latency that is hurting Bulldozer so much.<p>EDIT:  See example here:\n<a href=""http://realworldtech.com/forums/index.cfm?action=detail&id=123141&threadid=123055&roomid=2"" rel=""nofollow"">http://realworldtech.com/forums/index.cfm?action=detail&...</a>",1318448885

Unlike Cringely, my bet goes toward using more and more JIT'ed code (as in PyPy and v8) and better use of asynchronous APIs instead of lower-level languages. Of course, better integration with native code (as in ""compiled from a reasonable language"") will also be highly prized and a tool worth looking into.",1318448657

I'm one of 6 current CS seniors and our ""department"" (actually part of the Math department) consists of only five professors. Furthermore, there is almost no emphasis on programming in the major; all of the core classes (and most of the electives, which are few and far between) are focused strictly on computer science. While I personally appreciate this rigorous focus on theory as it complements my own practical experience, for most students it means never seeing a real, large programming project or the tools to manage it.<p>As a result of all this, many Wesleyan CS graduates go to grad school instead of start ups. This isn't helped by the single-minded focus of the career center on careers in finance and consulting, which leads to a complete absence of technical recruiting on campus. I and several other students including @samdk and @rubergly have tried to change this to some degree by offering more outlets for students on campus to program, but it's definitely an uphill battle.<p>That said, if NY/Boston startups feel like making the commute up to central Connecticut, they'll find many smart students with a strong grounding in computing theory and math.

Farmers pay a per-acre licensing fee to use the system, meaning they plant the GMO crops and then bomb their fields with the herbicide to kill everything but the crop, which improves yield.<p>The fact pattern in these Monsanto lawsuits seems to be that farmers are doing <i>three</i> things: (1) planting Monsanto's GMO crops (intentionally or not), (2) <i>using Monsanto's herbicide</i> to take advantage of the improved yield made possible with the crop, and (3) not paying Monsanto.<p>It is obviously possible for Monsanto GMO crops to end up in an unsuspecting farmer's field. But it's not possible for a farmer to accidentally use Roundup as an herbicide in that field. If they do that without paying Monsanto, they are trying to get something for nothing.

Rails is definitely not the only one, its just most popular. Most good libraries are framework indepenedent and have plugins into that framework. One example is Guard or CarrierWave. The elegance of it all is what separates it from java.<p>b) Much easier and faster to develop for. allows for rapid prototyping and mutations. Writing front-end servers in ruby > writing front-end servers in java as ruby can do things in 1 line that take 50 in java.<p>c) As we see with facebook, sometimes a ""slow"" front-end written in a prototyping language is better, but the back-end is written in a performant language.<p>d) The power of ruby/rails is the community. That is it's number one source of power and without it, rails is crap. There is a lot of Java developers, yet the awesome java frameworks are things like hadoop, meant for data processing.<p>I don't think there will be a ""second coming"" of java. I think Java will die, but the JVM (will probably) live on. Either that or the JVM will die to be replaced by something the community makes, if oracle has any say in the matter, knowing how oracle is doing everything possible to alienate java.<p>However there will be no second coming of java because it never left. Java is still going strong within the rails community as most are fully aware that you write your application in ruby, and anything important that has to be performant will be written in java.

It's a testament to Google's flat-seeming corporate culture that team members are encouraged to speak their mind so frankly.<p>The key paragraph for me is this one: <i>Any teams that have successfully internalized the notion that they should be externally programmable platforms from the ground up are underdogs -- Maps and Docs come to mind, and I know GMail is making overtures in that direction. But it's hard for them to get funding for it because it's not part of our culture. Maestro's funding is a feeble thing compared to the gargantuan Microsoft Office programming platform: it's a fluffy rabbit versus a T-Rex. The Docs team knows they'll never be competitive with Office until they can match its scripting facilities, but they're not getting any resource love. I mean, I assume they're not, given that Apps Script only works in Spreadsheet right now, and it doesn't even have keyboard shortcuts as part of its API. That team looks pretty unloved to me.</i><p>This is my perennial Google grumble in a more elegantly stated nutshell: Google is a magical playground of wonderful things, few of which are finished. It's magical because the parts that work do so at great speed and with almost spookily good results. It's maddening because some things are automagically interoperable and others are head-deskingly separate or incomplete. The main thing I use Google Docs for is word processing, and though it's great to have stuff in the cloud it's just absurd - absurd - that when I move to an Android device the UI is unavailable, or that the full UI lacks support for things like user-defined text styles.<p>Thing is, Docs owuld be fine if I was just using it for a personal journal or some glorified notepad. But now that I'm a student again, I'm writing letters and model legal briefs and things like that, and it's just a pain in the ass for that, so every day I flirt with reinstalling MS Office...2003.

Let F be the one-way function.<p>You give the spy a value x0. Then you compute x1=F(x0), x2=F(x1), ..., x_n = F(x_{n-1}). The guard is given x_n.<p>When the guard challenges the spy, the guard gives the spy x_n, the spy iterates F starting on x0 until he finds x_{n-1}, and gives that to the guard, who checks it.<p>The guard then replaces x_n with x_{n-1} and uses that for the next challenge, and so on. This allows for n border crossings before the spy and guard need to come to headquarters for new numbers.<p>Each spy can either have his own x_0, in which case the guard has to have an x_n for each spy, or you can have all the spies share the same x_0, or you can do something in between such as having the less important spies share a value and have your most important spies have their own values.",1292879401

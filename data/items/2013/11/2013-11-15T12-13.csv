The Last Psychiatrist blog is excellent.<p>The original story is unclear about whether it counted just articles in the magazines or adverts as well. It does mention the tech adverts in one magazine but the general tone is about tech &#x27;coverage&#x27; - as in the choice of the content. Which would seem to exclude ads, since I&#x27;d bet the magazines would accept advertising from whoever pays them enough.<p>I would guess that a study of the adverts would show a whole lot more tech products, as marketing departments can&#x27;t have failed to notice that women buy their products too.",1384520318

And I think we just can&#x27;t have enough of those people in the world. But for some reasons, especially guys think yoga is not for them. So one step towards world-peace would be if we got more guys to do yoga. Wouldn&#x27;t it be great if there was an online platform
that allows guys to practice their yoga secretly at home so they can show of their skills in public once they&#x27;ve mastered them?! And wouldn&#x27;t it be great if that platform also included a social network/video game style element to make it even more appealing to guys?!

In U.S. feds must shut down multiple very different service providers related to Bitcoin and even then there are other countries with their own companies and legislation.<p>Also, it&#x27;s one thing to say that some company helped Osama bin Laden to launder his money - there will be evidence and no one would make a big story out of it. Another thing is to say that &quot;we cannot do anything about this protocol, so we will shut down every single company just because they might use it&quot;. To shut down tens of companies you&#x27;d need to show evidence that they all somehow launder tons of money. That would be an epic event and it will be well-advertised, so prosecutors would have to be even more careful in what they say, or they will look like simple bullies on every newspaper. It&#x27;s just entirely different scale of action to take on everyone connected with Bitcoin.<p>If they do things slowly and try to kill companies one by one, then each time they would create more clarity on how to be compliant with the law which will make every next case even more difficult.<p>I have no doubt there will be war (there&#x27;s one already with all this regulatory crap, seizure of funds etc.), but it sure won&#x27;t be one single decision and little attention, like in case of Egold.",1384520173

I&#x27;ve since learned to use my Brother&#x27;s phone number)<p>* EFTA racing license for mountain bike race series around here in the summer time.<p>* NEMBA Membership card (mountain bike related)<p>* Gift Card to another coffee shop<p>* Home Depot Gift card (exact credit card shape and size)<p>So, as you can see, I&#x27;ve optimized a good chunk out of my wallet , but it&#x27;s not all the way there.

Hiked and Hitchhiked a few weeks through Europe with a girl. We met through a &quot;looking for hitchhiking partner&quot; forum. It was tremendous fun. We almost had no money and no iSomething but met a lot of nice people and got around very quickly. We also showered and changed clothes every few days. Smelling like shit complicates things. Hitchhiking is far easier if you look and smell &quot;normal&quot;.<p>I remember driving a BMW from the 7 series into the sunset heading to the atlantic ocean in france. I have the credit card of the car owner next to me (for the toll stations) as he is sleeping and we are listening to his favorite french chansons. He was a banker not much older than me. This connected feeling and trust is priceless and I&#x27;m really flabbergasted every time it works. There is a longing in the people you meet on your way and a longing in yourself. Nothing beats someone who stops and offers you ride after you were stuck for 6 hours in a godless place surrounded by refuges who are trying to enter great Britain in the back of trucks that cross the border. And you suddenly realize how important that passport in your pocket is. And how lucky and privileged you are and what desperation does to people. I don&#x27;t know. It changed my perspective on a lot of things.<p>If you are careful with your money and avoid tourist areas  and research cheap spots before going to big cities (more expensive if you don&#x27;t know where to live on the cheap) you can travel for 4 weeks for 500 to 1000 in western europe using only a tent and a small backpack. In eastern europe it is probably cheaper. We also went to restaurants quite often - so we were quite wasteful.<p>But if I would do it next year again I&#x27;d also take a smartphone with me.

I spoke gibberish and if you had the misfortune of talking to me, you would probably find an excuse to get away.
I hated the idea of going to social events. At every event, I felt that I was the stupidest person in the room and that nobody would want to talk to me. Meeting people seemed like a waste of time.<p>One day, something snapped. I figured that instead of wasting time at social events, I might as well learn something. I reflected on my social experiences and realized that because of my inherent fear of being looked down upon, I had the habit of pretending to understand things that in reality I had no clue. So I made it a point to speak a little as possible and instead focus on listening and always ask questions if I did not understand something.<p>I always made it a point to be asking questions and most importantly, never pretending to understand something I don&#x27;t. Conversations usually flows like this: What do you do? What exactly does that mean? Big data? How big? How is big data different from normal data? ...<p>Gradually, I started to understand what people are actually saying. I started to feel the wide spectrum of work that people do. I started to internalize differing opinions within similar industries and then voicing these opinions to others in similar fields. I started to take sides and participate in debates. Conversations became more intelligent and social events transformed into a heaven for intellectual stimulation.<p>Like reading Hacker News in the middle of the night, socializing can become addicting. There is so much knowledge out there and every time I go out I learn something new. If there was one lesson I learned throughout my transformation, it would be to focus on listening and understanding others.",1384518857

When Renault locks the electric car, they are reneging on their contractual obligations. So given that they want to recover the money, how will that work ? In court you can say &quot;I&#x27;m not paying for (a) the period that the car was disabled, ever (b) nor am I paying anything until the car is re-enabled&quot;, and that&#x27;s a defensible position. Given that the car costs exactly the same (in loan repayments) to Renault, whether it&#x27;s driving or locked down, this seems beyond stupid. I wonder who their legal advisor is.<p>Reneging on contractual obligations is something you should only ever do if you&#x27;re not expecting any payments anymore.<p>(Of course this would be the situation in Northwest Europe, I&#x27;m not sure how this works in the US, so YMMV.

First off, Crucial&#x27;s comparing DDR4 release specs to DDR3 release specs; in the 6 years since it came out, DDR3 has more than doubled in speed. Second, because memory controllers need to be altered to support DDR4, you won&#x27;t be able to buy it in a computer for at least another year until either Intel or AMD will release chipsets compatible with DDR4. Finally, there&#x27;s absolutely no discussion in there about the interesting parts of DDR4, like it moving to a pci-e style architecture of multiple channels.

This creates the integration and maintenance headaches that should be more than apparent to anyone who has worked on any sizable JavaScript code base.<p>In fact, I think we see the opposite in reality. It's much more effective to implement prototype-based OO systems using class-based OO languages. We see exactly this with the major JavaScript implementations (i.e., prototype-based OO systems) today being written in C++.<p>So prototype-based OO fails to deliver both in terms of expressiveness and maintainability. It is just a worse technique, when considering the facts. Trying to pretend it's good at things it clearly isn't good at doesn't make much sense to me.<p>And there's no ""language war"". C and C++ do the vast bulk of real work today. No other languages today can compare to them, and the ones that try still depend very heavily on one or both.",1367674829

Our goal is not to create a PDF from scratch but to create a copy of an existing PDF with some customised information added by a non technical user. Basically the best usage I would imagine would be a CV creator.<p>I totally agree the market is crowded but they are mainly on desktop application whereas we target website integration. That's still a crowded market but we feel there is a place for less ""corporate"" way of doing it, ie to not pay $10 000+ and have a SDK to integrate in your website.<p>Thanks again for taking time to giving your point of view.",1367673619

It should pay off however as it normally forces you to stick to best practices in coding and design, and to keep the end user in mind, and make the product better for everyone. Ideally it should be one of the fundamentals your product is built on, not an afterthought once you start getting support mails about it - however perhaps that just doesn't work in a startup environment where you need to get out a MVP and iterate fast.\nOutside of that, I think a change in culture is needed to make accessibility a core component of product management.",1367672478

It comes from the days when ""front end"" guys didn't want javascript or ""back end"" logic in their files.  Personally, I would just prefer that the code <i>for</i> a button be located <i>with</i> that button.  Crazy, I know.<p>Back in the day (2001) I didn't understand the separation of logic and presentation, although I grudgingly admitted that the front end guys had a lot of stuff to worry about that I didn't understand (cross browser issues, rendering issues).  These days, with jquery and widely available standards compliant browsers, plus all the design resources available on the web, we should all be both front end and back end developers, to a greater or lesser extent.<p>So we should strive to have clean code, but that, IMO, doesn't have nearly as much to do with separating concerns like templating and application logic as the ""pure-templates"" guys think.<p>I disagree with the ""pure-model"" and ""pure-controller"" guys on the back end for the same reasons.  They fall into the same platonic manichaeism: the world is a mess and if only The One Pure Way were followed, we'd be good.

3340507,comment,3340045,3340045,3,0,DanielGeisler,,,"I was a tech lead for many years, but I also have a background in psychology and the self-actualization movement. In my first and only role as a project manager I took over a team that had had it's spirit crushed. I took almost a month of working with them through their emotional problems before they were battle ready again. My biggest surprise and a significant disappointment was the amount of psychological counseling that it took to keep my workforce running with their heads on straight.<p>Loyalty is everything. The first team that I took over was a team that I was promoted from within. The team I was working on was stalled because bluntly they were not very good candidates for the job they were doing. I was the one person making progress and I was making significant progress at that. This was the first software development contract my company has obtained, everything rode on it and the president/owner of the company worked in the programming pit with us, which is how he knew I was making progress. So I ended up managing a group of people who were my close friends and I desperately wanted things to work so that we could all keep our jobs. I extended major loyalty to my team members and was amazed at the depth of loyalty and even fanaticism they returned to me.<p>Projects are like jigsaw puzzles, they need the right technology and people to fit together to make a greater whole. During the interview process and the continuing during the job I was always working to have a greater understanding of what my employee's goals were and what their path to self-actualization was. When I inherited people who has no interest in self-actualization, in being greater than they were I let go. If you can understand how to plug people into your project in a way as to provide them with a path to their self-actualization your team will follow you into hell.<p>Be heroic. Through away your job description because it doesn't mean crap. If you are a manager, particularly a technical manager, you personally own the entire project. Your employees are there to help you out. Do what ever you need to make things work within the bounds of ethics. If the team needs you to personally wash their cars in order to maximize the progress of your project then you get off your ass and you wash their cars.<p>Be a friend and ally to everyone. Most projects have not only technical bottlenecks but political bottlenecks. Even if you are the god of software development, it is not enough. Often being a god of social engineering will get you much further. Be Santa Claus and freely shower the people and organizations you interface with with your technical gifts and screw the fact that this is never a part of anyone's job description. Great managers only care about overcoming the barriers that are in their way. The fact that those barrier are bullshit is irrelevant, the fact that the domain of those barrier are not with your job description is irrelevant. When every single person inside your team and interfacing with your team sees you as a powerful ally and a friend then you can make miracles happen.",1323625668

With Just In Time compilation, this could become a non-problem, but I'm not sure how well Ruby can be optimized due to its very dynamic nature.</i><p>Ruby 1.8 is interpreted, in the classic sense. Ruby 1.9, the current production version, 'compiles' to bytecode internally. TRPL was written when 1.8 was still the production version of Ruby (although it does cover most, but not all, of 1.9's syntax). Also, JRuby's JIT works well and typically yields better-than-MRI performance after a short running time.<p><i>The lack of a formal specification and the ugly grammar put me off.</i><p>It's not entirely complete yet but a formal specification, targeted for ISO, is on the way - there's a 300 PDF floating around somewhere ;-) Due to the length of the process, it focuses on Ruby 1.8 for now, I believe.

I pretty much started my current company by accident -- I was too afraid of doing a hardware startup and tackling the energy question head-on. I tricked myself into starting by saying I wanted to just make it an open source project, and hoping someone with more resources could take it further. A common mistake, which, once I realized I'd have to push it forward myself, I overcame.<p>Even then, I was quite afraid that as a young woman, without many credentials, the energy industry wouldn't take me seriously. It turns out that a lot of this can be dealt with by assembling a great team around oneself. Also, even though I've been dismissed on numerous occasions, without much of a thought on their part, because I am a young woman, it turns out that, for the most part, people can have their minds changed quite readily by confident expressions of confidence. Perhaps even by being unexpectedly knowledgable, they remember me better?<p>I will declare that misogyny still exists within the ranks of investors and engineers, which can be quite upsetting.

There is a tax on toasted subs.  Idiotic protesters were allowed to block Market St., halting street cars, rerouting buses, disrupting commutes, and closing the MUNI station while blathering about how it was there first amendment right to do so (it's not).

(A 20+ way join for the most common query. Bureaucrats for the project kill!)<p>generating dynamic web pages. I made a template based system, very much like PHP, but before PHP was popular, even before I was aware of PHP.<p>These were all done with ""mindy"", the CMU dylan interpreter. It was a byte code compiled interpreter, but its compiler was so fast you never noticed the ""make"". Very fast startup time on the executables as well. You would need a stopwatch with milliseconds to tell the workflow from a ""edit-run-repeat"" scripting language. Mindy was later abandoned because it didn't have macros and it was deemed too much work to add it.<p>The rub is, Dylan macros <i>will</i> hurt your head. They are not easy to understand, ludicrously difficult to implement (been there), and I suspect frightening to extract coherent compile time error messages in a large system. I rather liked the language without them, though I can also see the appeal of a language with them (or a similar extension mechanism).<p>Overall I can recommend it for:<p>Good compile time detection of many stupid errors.<p> Excellent readability. (It is verbose, e.g. ""end method frabulate-widget;"", but that is a single keystroke in the emacs mode, the ""end whatever the heck I'm in"" key.)<p> Safe.<p>Powerful.<p> Multimethods. Dispatch guided by both type and singleton values. Once you get the hang of this, and design your frameworks with it in mind, you will cry when you have to go back to a language without it.<p>Things which are concerns:<p> Multimethods. Once you have built a system that is extended in different places by overriding multi methods, and you ask yourself the question: ""What happens when I call XYZ(a,b,c)?"" You don't really know where to look to find the answer. It could be anywhere. If you write a library, you can't really <i>know</i> what a call to XYZ(a) will do. It could be overridden in some flakey user code. (there are various sealing declarations to prevent extension on methods and types, but then you lose the advantages of extension)<p> Macros. I doubt I could have taught one in twenty of our engineers to be proficient in the macro system. I can see what the language designers were aiming at with it, but I think they over estimated the abilities of the population.",1323623579

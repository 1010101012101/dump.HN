They are the people who recognize what will be persuasive, and adopt or create it.<p>They are also the people who try new things and are out ""persuading.""<p>Trendsetters are necessary but not sufficient condition for creating a trend. The lesson for marketers is that you need to create a product that fits the times <i>and</i> push it to the right people.",1261810647

There isn't a bird that has the payload of a Cessna, let alone a 747.<p>> The hummingbird can hover better than a Harrier or a JSF. If you want to start an argument, pick on that.<p>What definition of ""better"" are we using?  I've yet to see a hummingbird which can carry a person, which a Harrier can do.<p>Hummingbirds are quieter than Harriers, but if I want to break something, they're rather useless.",1261810358

I said that the two parties had different opinions about the assets in question wrt themselves.  They can both be correct.  (They can also both be wrong.)",1261810015

1015776,comment,1015368,1015717,0,0,city41,,,"> Agreed that Limited is better. But it still costs money, yes? A new deck every time?<p>The draft I play in charges $8 for three boosters. You get to keep the cards and you can easily sell your rares for >$8 most of the time if you want. $8 for an evening of entertainment isn't bad, cheaper than a movie.<p>> My problem with M:TG is that the knowledge keeps turning over.<p>It really doesn't though, it just changes form on the surface. The pillars of Magic are card advantage, speed, efficiency and a good mana curve. Those things apply universally, it really doesn't take long to get up on the new cards. In draft you are rarely going to make an elaborate deck, it's much more about bang for the buck (granted, this does mean you are missing out on a entire side of the game, but that's the side that requires money and time, so...) At most 3 expansions are legal at a time. I was a very serious/obsessed player in the 90's, now I am a very casual for fun player. All the cards I own fit easily in one tiny box. Draft/limited play really can be for fun and simple.",1261809152

At least his attack on you directly addressed (and undermined) your argument, instead of just being a grammar nitpick.<p>Fallacies don't cancel each other out, even when misapplied :)",1261808872

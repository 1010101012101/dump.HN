The analogue is parents saying ""you'll understand it when you are older"". Either you trust your parents or you don't, but you can not verify that claim logically while you are young. Hence I find that kind of thing not useful for a debate. Traditionally I think those statements have only helped to make kids angry :-) You may say that parents were usually right, but I don't think so.<p>KS or anybody else are welcome to state their own experience, but arguing ""I was like you before my eyes were opened"" is creating a fake additional anecdote. Just because person A went from opinion/situation X to opinion Z, it doesn't imply that all people with opinion/situation X will eventually come around to opinion Z.

A sort of Platonic Ideal.<p>My reasoning is the evidence, meaning the reason it is the one true novel is because I believe a novel is: the act of attempting to fully represent an individual's experience;  If you disagree with my definition of novelisation, that's fine, but it is how I classify novels, and in so much Joyce achieves the nearest perfection of this through the novels seeming opaque or random nature.<p>One's experience is a cloud of infinite affects and effects that one could attempt to catalogue, but would fail miserably.  Here is exactly what Joyce achieved.  Through Ulysses' failures it achieves perfection.  Like Dali's belief that all things are latent with hidden meanings, or how if you hate Warhol because you think his work is crap then you should recognise that you actually love his work because his message was to show you that all mass manufacture is simply the production of crap.<p>It is more than What?, it is Why?.<p>Finnegan's Wake is an even a better example of this belief in practice, but it throws out the rules which unjustly garners it ire.  
Ulysses plays by the rules, that is grammar`dictionary`genre, and that is why I believe it is held in higher regard.<p>tl;dr : if you think Ulysses is difficult to read and incomprehensible, you are reading it correctly.  Read it without guides, they dismantle the work's truth.",1350261721

My perspective on such things is that say you have 1000 followers of your blog and you write on a topic. Odds are that out of the 1000, 75% of them will likely not give any feedback, 10% will give positive, 8% will give negative and then there's the 2% that may verbally harass you because they are offended. Does this mean that they are bad people for doing something like that? Well I guess it's up to you to decide whether they are.<p>However, try to remember that there are people out there who were not taught or never picked up on the idea that you should be courteous when talking to over individuals. Maybe they were never taught it, taught the opposite, or have difficulty in controlling their anger. They can also believe so strongly in something to the point of doing something unethical. 
The point is not to take things personally when people attack you directly versus your ideas. Instead why not ask them why they felt it was necessary to talk in that fashion?<p>Apologizing for offending them can also help in alleviating  any direct attacks as it makes them aware of how they are acting.

As the title implies I am 14 years old and an intermediate programmer. I would consider myself ""fluent"" in python with also experience in objC JavaScript HTML and a handful of other technologies. The problem is that my school does not offer any computer science courses other than Computer Applications 1 (learning how to use word, PowerPoint etc). Anyway, I feel as if I am stuck. Lots of people recommend creating some shareware or something like that. The problem is that while I know all the ins and outs of python(ish) this task seems daunting. The jump from intermediate to advanced, if you will, is huge. I would love to publish a desktop application that syncs with multiple cloud services but again, but the API's are daunting.

You could get away with nothing but arc() and moveTo() in your loop instead and make it a bit more efficient on slower (mobile) devices, because only one new path has to get created.<p>Your moveTo's x coordinate is going to need to be offset by the radius since thats where each starts.

    loop start
        s.moveTo(10 * b + 5 + 4, 10 * c + 5)

9103800,comment,9101094,9103745,0,0,conistonwater,,,"My point is that utility is a rather narrowly-defined concept, so if you find a situation where people don&#x27;t seem to be maximizing <i>any</i> utility function, one of the possibilities is that the concept of a utility function is too narrowly-defined. Things like anchoring, loss aversion, ambiguity aversion can all be modelled: the only thing you lose is the name &quot;utility function&quot;. Maybe the utility function needs to depend on the entire history of states (for loss aversion), or maybe the question being asked is subject to uncertainty, or there is a fundamental amount of model uncertainty. All of those can be modelled in probabilistic terms.<p>So if rational maximization means that people have a utility function that they maximize, then yes, rational maximization is not what people do. But that is partly the fault of how the definition of utility was chosen.",1424814895

9103796,comment,9100294,9103403,0,0,freehunter,,,"A first baseman, sure. They only need to be able catch well and sometimes throw across the infield. Find me an out-of-shape center fielder. Miguel Cabrera, for example, is a bit bigger. He&#x27;s slow getting around the bases. But his talent, other than being a first baseman, is hitting the ball hard enough that he can casually stroll around the bases if he wants.<p>But humans were meant to run. That&#x27;s why we stand upright, that&#x27;s why we sweat. Running long distances on a flat grass field, to a trained athlete, is going to be less fatiguing than standing still in the sun waiting for something to happen. Pitchers throw 100+ pitches at 90+ MPH and for the most part, are dead accurate. Even if the ball is spiraling through the air to confuse the batter. And the players, other than the starting pitcher, are out there almost every single day, and sometimes play two games per day. Baseball has a ridiculously packed schedule.<p>So I would disagree that soccer players have it rougher. Running is easy.",1424814871

Bats and dolphins [1] using echolocation that - I&#x27;ve heard - works the same way but the pressures on them are different, the environments different. Given the random occurrence of mutations it seems striking (to me) that these similar paths should be followed.<p>A corollary would appear to be also that if parallel evolution can converge on identical structures that reliance on morphological features to indicate common ancestry is flawed. If evolution tends to converge then a geological sample with a simple form of fossil can&#x27;t be assumed to be contemporaneous with another sample, the fossils could be the result of parallel evolution.<p>I&#x27;ve never understood why mainstream paleo-biology seems to reject that life could have started in more than one place.

9103784,comment,9100487,9100826,0,0,sowhatquestion,,,"> Millennials, however, use physical media all the way... They have huge DVD collections<p>As a millenial, I have to say this statement could hardly be more misleading. Millenials I know may have DVD and even VHS collections, but that&#x27;s only because these media are effectively &quot;dead,&quot; so used items can be had for free or cheap via thrift stores. (Remember that we&#x27;re young and (mostly) poor; these simple facts explain 99% of so-called &quot;generational trends.&quot;)<p>Other physical media (viz., vinyl records) are typically kept around for nostalgia/display value. Someone who has a record on vinyl might listen to it more often as an MP3 or stream--but those things don&#x27;t fulfill the  universal human need to put all the stuff you like on a shelf.<p>> and even where they don&#x27;t they accept only DRM&#x27;ed, thoroughly walled gardens where you can rent stuff for a limited time and those companies only allow you to consume things in a very restrictive manner.<p>Ah, so you&#x27;re saying millenials don&#x27;t use the kind of digital media that squares with your politics! Fascinating, tell me more. But this is the simplest thing in the world to explain: people don&#x27;t actually want to <i>own</i> media. We want to (1) access it when we want to experience it, and (2) signal to others that we like it. Streaming solves the first problem easily and cheaply. Occasional physical purchases solve the second problem.<p>Regarding DRM&#x27;d streaming in particular, do you know how many hours of my life I sacrificed in the early 2000s hand-editing MP3 tags, copying files between devices, etc.? Neither do I, and I don&#x27;t want to know because I&#x27;m sure it was obscenely high. I would gladly pay Google Play twice the $10/month I pay them so that I will never to have to return to those dark times. And I feel similarly about Netflix.<p>If for some reason my streaming services don&#x27;t have a piece of media--or if I need something they do have in DRM-free form--I can torrent it or (vomit) purchase it from Amazon/iTunes. Honestly, it&#x27;s a beautiful system--I get so much for so little. It feels like the exact opposite of a &quot;loss of capability.&quot;<p>But this isn&#x27;t an &quot;I love Big Brother&quot; moment. I accept the system <i>only</i> because I always have the option to pirate what I need. That&#x27;s why I don&#x27;t see DRM as the problem. DRM can never eliminate piracy due to the &quot;analog hole.&quot; Law enforcement, the courts, and Big Content could do a lot more to crack down on it though. That&#x27;s why, on the one hand, I really won&#x27;t lift a finger to do anything about DRM, but on the other hand, I&#x27;d be willing to expend a lot of energy opposing <i>any</i> law that would further empower copyright owners. That&#x27;s why I&#x27;ve donated to the Pirate Bay. Etc.<p>If you want to take the discussion in a more idealistic direction, I think reducing the copyright term to 15-20 years would be a much more important change than anything else I&#x27;ve discussed. And unlike anti-DRM activism, copyright term reform is something that almost anyone can understand and relate to.<p>> they mostly only read paper-based books<p>Did you RTFA? The whole thing is about why books are an exception. No one is concerned with &quot;reading comprehension&quot; when it comes to music or movies. Psychologists in TFA appear to be saying--and I agree--that our comprehension and retention of long-form printed material is facilitated in subtle ways by the physicality of books.<p>TL;DR if the system stays as open as it is today, I think digital media are clearly succeeding. In a context where Netflix is one option among several, it&#x27;s a godsend. In a context where it&#x27;s the only option, I think you have a better case--but we can prevent things from deteriorating to that point.",1424814765

That is, operating systems that can very efficiently fork processes and quickly deal with many small files. Unfortunately, Windows does neither well. Process creation is slower, and NTFS is a very lock-happy filesystem.<p>Why do I consider this gross as a user? Things like Git that utilize msys are slow on Windows. As in, I notice the UI hanging. Things like autoconf are terribly slow on Windows due to all of the small processes that are created to detect the environment. Antivirus tools will lock files that are created and generally slow things down due to the nature of lots of quick-running processes creating and deleting small files.<p>These are just realities of most software written for non-Windows platforms. So whenever I see a program that requires MinGW, I&#x27;m always very hesitant to use it. The user experience tends to be terrible. I can still remember an issue trying to compile subversion on Windows using gcc and having it take well over an hour. Turns out with all of the processes being forked and temp files being created, the antivirus program was adding a delay to every command. After completely disabling antivirus it compiled in 15 minutes.<p>So, in one sense, this ins&#x27;t a problem with MinGW or msys, but it typical of software that relies on it.<p>The other issues I have with them is that they don&#x27;t integrate well with the native tools on Windows. For instance, Pageant is a good, graphical SSH agent on Windows. You have to mess around with environmental variables and plink and junk to get it so you don&#x27;t have multiple formats of SSH keys on your machine. Trying to deal with SSH through bash and msys is not a user friendly experience. PuTTY is the gold standard of SSH clients on Windows.<p>Using msys/MinGW is like running X programs on OS X, Windows programs through Wine on Linux, or Java GUIs on any OS. It has enough strange warts and doesn&#x27;t quite fit the feel of the rest of the OS.<p>That is where Go was awesome. I downloaded go and there were 3 exes on my machine. I ran &quot;go.exe build source.go&quot; and out popped an exe.",1424813461

They were round up and uprooted and shoved into trains and drained of their wealth and they suffered immense and undeniable horrors along with all sorts of other victim groups. The narrow focus here is on the question of gas chambers. This specific alleged killing mechanism never existed. It is a conspiracy theory to think they did. A conspiracy theory that 99% of people firmly believe in, without evidence. That is all that is being argued. In the same way that all historians deny the existence of steam chambers, electrocution schemes, head shrinking procedures, killing machines powered by pedaling, some more brave historians also deny the existence of gas chambers, because there&#x27;s as much evidence for it (none) as there is for those other wartime rumors.<p>Why are you not overly analytical like that with regards to the claims that there were gas chambers? If you are in possession of any documentary evidence for them, which seems to be the case since you dispute what two people on opposite sides of an interview take for granted, then you should just show it and the discussion would be over.<p>I&#x27;m giving you a shortcut into this. Look up the trial of Ernst Zundel and you can read the transcript of when Raul Hilberg declares that, from the (literally) tons of records that the Nazis left, there is no document that can serve as evidence for there being gas chambers, or for gas chambers being used as an extermination method. Also look into the work of David Cole who was responsible for unearthing the now mainstream fact that the supposed gas chambers in Auschwitz are post-war reconstructions.<p>If you want more information on the Le Monde publication, you can go and read or watch what Sylvia Stolz has to say.

Yes, I&#x27;m going to be that guy.<p>- As this appears to be a photoshoot for SmugMug, of SmugMug employees, does Smugmug carry the proper class of insurance on their employees to allow this sort of work? In most cases, unless additional coverage was purchased from the insurer, your general &quot;office worker&quot; insurance will not cover this type of work.<p>- Was the building owner aware of the photoshoot, and did they have the insurance to cover this sort of work?<p>- Does Von Wong&#x27;s liability insurance cover this sort of work (especially since he&#x27;s not tied off when jumping around on the ledges)?<p>- I don&#x27;t see a shock absorber attached to the harness, whcih is necessary to limit the forces on the person to 900lbs (body belt) or 1800lbs (harness) in the even of a fall. I also note that the harness looks like it&#x27;s a climbing harness NOT a proepr fall-arrest harness (the exception I saw was Hell-girl).  Generally you must wear a full body harness rated for fall-arrest and be attached using the back D-ring when doing this type of work.<p>- The tie-off point, while not visible in the video/photos, (generally) must be a certified tie-off anchor or rated to 5000lbs arresting strength.  Using a travel limiting device _may_ have been acceptable, but there doesn&#x27;t appear to be one.<p>- The webbing making a sharp angle across the roof flashing is also not ideal, as you should be anchored from above in almost all cases.<p>- Was there a rescue plan in place?  Had someone fallen, what would have happened?<p>If all of these things were taken into consideration and properly addressed, then thank you for doing your due diligence, otherwise I feel like this has OSHA violation written all over it.<p>I imagine the city of San Francisco also has regulations when suspending equipment beyond a buildings footprint over an active street.<p>People die regularly from improper fall arrest systems. You were not just doing a fun photo-shoot, YOU were responsible for these people&#x27;s lives, as well as the lives of anyone walking below.<p>I will acknowledge that my knowledge relates to the Canadian labour code, but the US regulations appear to be similar.<p><a href=""https://www.osha.gov/Region7/fallprotection/fall_protection_info.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.osha.gov/Region7/fallprotection/fall_protection_...</a>

Many libraries use an LCG[1] with 32 to 64 bit state, which is trivial to reconstruct through a small sample of its output not much longer than the internal state.<p>I don&#x27;t know about you, but requiring my sort() routine to have access to a cryptographically secure random number generator doesn&#x27;t seem right; I much prefer any algorithm (e.g. HeapSort, Mergesort or TimSort) that can guarantee n\*log(n) behavior with deterministic (and especially, no secure random generator requirement!) behavior.<p>[0] <a href=""http://www.cs.dartmouth.edu/~doug/mdmspe.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cs.dartmouth.edu/~doug/mdmspe.pdf</a><p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_congruential_generator"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_congruential_generator</a>",1424811997

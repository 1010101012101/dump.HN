That sounds equally as bad to me as ""sorry, no woman accepted"" or ""sorry, no latinos accepted"".<p>Can anybody explain?<p>I honestly hope the girls will get the skills they're looking for in 10 weeks, and I support that, but I truly don't get why do they have to discriminate against.

The soviet would have never got in many places of the desert and had mapped villages and roads from aerial photography.  Those features would remain on our (US) maps.<p>As they rushed into the war, the geomatic guys responsible for making maps somehow reused the soviet maps and there was no way to assume those roads and villages didn't actually exist.  So they persisted on our maps, up until 2010.  Data around main areas would end up getting corrected (patrols would complain about the inaccuracy and the geo guys would update their database).  Data in the desert would remain erroneous in many case.<p>For instance, I could simply look at a village's location on satellite imagery, such as a casual Google Map, and clearly see there was nothing there but maybe some odd looking shapes and shadows due to rock formations.  So even hand-crafted maps, in military operation, almost 10 years into the war, can remain inaccurate.<p>Worst, maps of many military bases in North America are completely wrong as soon as you get off the few main roads listed on it.<p>I came to rely on satellite imagery whenever you want to go on a somehow non-urban track.

Several cartridges contained ARM chips, in fact, and boosted the computing power of the console tremendously; this sort of thing is why the 3rd and 4th gen consoles were able to last for so long.<p>NES games were produced for 11 years after the console was originally released (and the console itself was produced for 20 years!) because of this flexibility; SNES games were produced 8 years after the console was released as well.

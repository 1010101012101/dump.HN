And if you're prepared to make a lot of columns with the various flags you need, you can build up quite complex queries - having an easy way to do this would be nice though.<p>I've spent a lot of time in Financial Services and it's surprising how much of the industry is run on spreadsheets, especially investment banking - and I mean online - they'll have Excel running all day, receiving real time price feeds, running a calculation and republishing. Excel is pretty much the glue that holds the whole industry together.<p>So I also agree on the maintenance issue - These sheets can get quite complex and it's almost impossible for someone to understand coming in cold. It would be very useful to have a workflow model on top - which I guess is really adding the algorithm aspect - but I've never seen a speadsheet metaphor that does this well.",1231717916

They keep all 4 computers in the house in sync with each other as well as backups on a NAS.<p>Why even bother with rsync you may ask? Because for huge binary files (like RAW/JPEG images) I don't need a history of changes and they don't compress well, i.e. git would lead to an increased disk usage.<p>BTW using ""any VCS"" advice won't work here. Git can automatically pick up rename/delete/create actions on whole directory trees without explicit commands, which is what you want if you're going for 100% automatic operation: if I delete a file on laptop ""A"" it will automatically disappear on laptop ""B"" too. Perhaps git isn't unique in this, but its better among other VCS systems I'm familiar with. It also is very compact, especially if you don't want to have a full-blown uncompressed working tree on a server.<p>I love Dropbox, but I don't see how I could use it with my 55K/second upload speed, which is, unfortunately, quite typical for US users.

429836,comment,429028,429583,0,0,boucher,,,"I don't think being interpreted matters. It may make your immediate development cycle faster, but that says nothing about long term development. I imagine the Scala guys would argue heavily that being compiled is a huge advantage to the power of that language, and would also strongly disagree that it isn't a high level language.<p>Objective-C properties are poorly done in my opinion, though you can add one in two lines with a given set of assumptions. But I don't think 1 vs. 3 lines is a meaningful indicator of very much either way; it's a small constant penalty, not some lack of expression at the core of the language.<p>Being verbose isn't a bad thing, and Objective-C isn't verbose in any meaningfully different way than most other languages. Header files may be a slight inconvenience, but they aren't even strictly necessary. Cocoa, the framework most commonly associated with Objective-C is verbose, and I think its a good thing. 90% of what you do as a programmer is read code, not write it. I gladly pay the penalty of 2x the keystrokes in return for half the mental overhead in reading the code. In reality, the penalty is less than 2, and the benefit may be more than 2, but its a matter of opinion.<p>You say you wouldn't like Obj-C as an interpreted language, I wonder if you're aware of Objective-J (<a href=""http://cappuccino.org"" rel=""nofollow"">http://cappuccino.org</a>). It's essentially an interpreted version of Objective-C. It doesn't have header files, and it doesn't do properties the same way (it only does code generation for accessor methods, nothing else, but that generation is one extra keyword). It's interpreted, it has closures, and it generally has every feature JavaScript already has, plus dynamic message sending and classical inheritance courtesy of the Obj-J runtime (which is functionally equivalent to the Obj-C runtime). I'm biased, but I think its a great language.",1231717482

429832,comment,427780,429300,0,0,cchooper,,,"I actually agree with Sussman and Wisdom (and the author of this article) that physics is taught in a very sloppy manner, and that the computational notation has huge advantages. But that's not the point I (or they) were making. Lagrangian and Hamiltonian mechanics were perfectly rigorous before Sussman and Wisdom came along, even if they weren't taught very well. If mechanics had really been deep-down sloppy, then Sussman and Wisdom would now be heralded alongside Newton and Einstein for their incredible contribution to science! Rather than just creating a new notation, they would have advanced science incalculably, turning vague and untestable theories into hard empirical science for the first time!<p>But that's obviously not what happened. Physicists were always capable of making exact calculations and predictions from Lagrangian mechanics. SICM contains no new theories, theorems or proofs, just a more explicit way of representing old ones. Nothing new was discovered and no old notions were clarified. Instead, they just found a better way of <i>teaching</i> mechanics, one that didn't rely on the implicit knowledge that masters of the subject already possessed. They were only capable of doing this because Lagrangian and Hamiltonian mechanics were well-defined in the first place. If they hadn't been then they would have had to advance a new theory of mechanics to replace them, rather than just re-presenting an old one.",1231717194

You can't please everyone, and you can't implement every feature that every user thinks they'd want for their one specific situation.  Instead you take all those requests and let them sit in the subconscious.  As the article said, the ones people REALLY need will bubble to the surface again and again.<p>It's also commonly said that the customer doesn't REALLY know what they want or need.  It's up to you to take their requirements and apply your expertise to the situation giving them the solution they need, rather than the solution they may be asking for.",1231715219

429781,comment,429477,429477,0,0,aaw,,,"I used to work for a decent-sized international bank that used Excel for pretty much everything (any development projects were doomed if users couldn't pull the data they produced/exposed into Excel). So I can tell you some of the things I saw people need when working with Excel in a large organization:<p>1. Ability to push/pull a range from a company-wide database, based on a (name,date) key. When you pull based on a (name,date) key, you get the first range with that name that was published on or before the date you specified. A dev team at the bank implemented this and people really loved it.<p>2. Versioning, but more for reasons of space than for having a ""blame"" feature. People use the same spreadsheet daily/weekly to create a report, so they have to save copies of the reports daily/weekly in case they need to reproduce the calculations from a particular report even though the differences from report to report were just minor tweaks. It wasn't uncommon for me to see spreadsheets that were > 100 MB, copied and saved daily.<p>3. Better explaining of formulas - you can ask Excel what cells reference another cell and it'll draw a bunch of arrows for you, but it still takes a lot of concentration to figure out why you're getting the number 4 in a cell when its references are many cells deep, spread across several worksheets. It would be nice if there was a clear way of explaining a cell's formula without having to navigate from worksheet to worksheet and actually hand-trace the references. Even collecting all of the references in one place and drawing out a tree of formulas would be an improvement.",1231714991

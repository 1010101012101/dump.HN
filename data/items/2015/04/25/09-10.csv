To outsider that&#x27;s all they&#x27;re doing and to those the problem is impenetrable. Insiders, however, immediately recognise the informal protocol of logic quizzes that this is not a random casual conversation, it is carefully written to encode just enough information to be solvable as a logic problem. These insiders know to carefully extract (decode) this information. Only then do they solve the logic problem.<p>The &quot;dishonesty&quot; of the problem, which is confusing to people expecting the problem to be stated honestly, is that the conversation in the problem is entirely contrived, there is no way is would ever happened as part of a real world exchange about birthdays.

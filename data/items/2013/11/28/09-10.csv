6813859,comment,6812675,6813673,10,0,barrkel,,,"Interpreters typically use polymorphic locations to hold values for the interpreted language. Technically almost any type of polymorphism is enough, but the fewer indirections you can get away with, the faster you can make a simple interpreter. So that would usually mean a sum type in a functional programming language with algebraic data types, or a simple object in an OO language, or a tagged union in C and Pascal.<p>But for better performance, approaches like tagged pointers (often used in Lisp implementations) are useful, as it eliminates a level of indirection for most integer operations. If you can afford to use 64 bits for your values, you might consider using doubles everywhere, with invalid exponents for stuffing a shortened pointer inside the float (I believe luajit uses, or used to use, this technique; it would probably be a good match for JS as well, as JS doesn&#x27;t have integers).",1385632533

6813843,comment,6810543,6812361,1,0,rockyleal,,,"No, it is true. To describe a currency as &#x27;debt-free&#x27; means that it is not created through the process of creating new debt. The way modern currencies like the dollar are emitted  is through the generation of new debt (government bonds are government debt, and banks create new currency when they &#x27;loan&#x27; money). The negative consequences of not paying what you borrow (forclosure, etc.) are ultimately what backs debt-based currencies. Graeber argues (and I agree) that it is therefore the threat of violence from the state what gives value to currency in the modern era.<p>Bitcoin is fundamentally different because new currency is created through mining. Yes, you could create a secondary market on top of Bitcoin that handles loans, but not new Bitcoins, therefore it is debt- free currency. When Nixon decided to decouple the dollar from gold in the seventies, what he did was effectively to move from a debt-free currency to a debt based currency. The move had huge implications in shaping the world until today, because it meant that the US became free to print dollars endlessly. The external market for dollars was solid because of the world reserve status, enforced through the US military. In this way the US could print away AND keep internal inflation very low in relation to the amount of circulating currency.<p>Breaking this cycle, which is what feeds the US empire, is why I think Bitcoin will in the end provide a great service to mankind.",1385632236

So PREDICTING a collision (finding a doc that will collide with a given doc) is very very very difficult.

Nokia planned to evolve it into Meego proper, but never did since it soon sunk into the oblivion of WP. Some parts of Meego (not Harmattan) were forked by the community as Mer, and some other parts (namely Meego Handset) as Nemo. Sailfish is built on Mer and parts of Nemo, adding its own UI on top.

What is it about a government that only it can do certain things, while private enterprises and persons are claimed to be incapable of accomplishing it?<p>But the fundamental question is not whether we can make our system better or worse. The fundamental question is, is it okay to steal from others? When government takes taxes, it steals.

How did they express the reality? Indeed, you have thousands of people like that - and through almost all the centuries. And they have expressed what it feels like.<p>Are they able to manipulate our reality? Perhaps. We indeed read about these things. But then, the focus usually is on the fact that everybody has access to that state, and waking up from Maya is something inherently a journey into the self.<p>UG Krishnamurti (who was supposedly one of enlightened persons) put it as this: &quot;How can you transmit certainty of certainty of truth to somebody else?&quot;.

It&#x27;s called the Universal Dovetailer, and it&#x27;s a simple program that runs all possible programs. On each step it runs the next instruction of every program running so far and introduces the first step of a new program. Given infinite time, it performs every conceivable computation.<p>Due to the Church-Turin thesis, we know that the infinite set of all programs can be enumerated and we also know that it doesn&#x27;t matter in which programming language we use, provided it is Turing-complete.<p>Since the Universal Dovetailer is a conceivable program, this computation will contain itself in a recursive fashion (simulations within simulations).",1385629334

The dominance frontiers algorithm is actually not that good imho, there are better options[2], especially considering that one may not want to construct an unnecessary dominance tree in an Interpreter/VM.\nNow, I have no experience how much overhead SSA-deconstruction inflicts when lowering to machine code.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.cdl.uni-saarland.de/projects/ssara/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cdl.uni-saarland.de/projects/ssara/</a>\n[2] <a href=""http://www.cdl.uni-saarland.de/projects/ssaconstr/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cdl.uni-saarland.de/projects/ssaconstr/</a><p>Yes, I&#x27;m associated with that group.",1385629319

Instead of code points, humans usually handle text by graphemes, which have an arbitrary length in edge cases [0] no matter what encoding is used. An O(1) solution for graphemes would be an array of pointers to grapheme objects, which is slower and more memory hungry than necessary in most cases.<p>[0] <a href=""http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6579844/how-does-zalgo-text-work"" rel=""nofollow"">http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6579844/how-does-zalgo-te...</a>",1385629253

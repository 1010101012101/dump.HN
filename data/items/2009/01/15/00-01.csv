434617,comment,433852,434520,0,0,stcredzero,,,"Yeah, once I broke down in the shower, crying.  I was also in my 20's.<p>My current girlfriend sometimes would pull that ""I don't feel the same anymore"" stuff.  It was happening almost every other month, but there was a pattern.  We instituted a rule: no talking about relationship status within 3 days of her period.  Things are much improved.<p>As for coping, yeah, a lot of this is just weird brain chemistry stuff.  A little Buddhist philosophy is useful.  Just remember that feelings are transitory.  Don't let yourself get swept up by them.  Don't let your most significant understanding of reality get swept up in them and be determined by them.  Don't take action based just on these feelings.  Let it past first, and then deal with things when you are calm.  (Things might still suck, but be sure you're not in <i>despair</i> when you make decisions.  Find someone else to talk to.)<p>When you're broken up with, there's another set of biochemical changes in your brain.  Yes, it's supposed to look like withdrawal.  In fact, some biologists will recommend that you take up something like jogging because your endorphin levels are crashing.  Remember to take care of yourself, particularly your physical self with every bit of care that you would've taken care of her.<p>Know who you are and be true to your principles, even if this feels like you are giving up your one unbelievable cosmic chance for ineffable happiness.  (If you are in your 20's, this is very unlikely to be the case.)  Be gentle and firm if the situation warrants it, but don't ever be angry.  Be willing to let her go, if that's what's the best for her, or the world, or the Allied war effort.  (Yes, as in Casablanca.)  Concentrate on being the most good, honorable, and empathic man you can be.  Do this because this is really the one and only chance to get her back.  There are all kinds of manipulation you can try to get her back, but ultimately these will shortchange you even if they do work at first.  Be willing to do what's the best for her, for you, for everyone as a whole, even if you have to let her go.  Be willing to give her that one last act of unselfish love.  Let her go quietly if that is indeed what it turns out to be.  (This is not to refrain from expressing your undying love for her.  By all means do that.  Rather, refrain from the use of threats, emotional aggression, holding yourself as hostage, that kind of stuff.)<p>I made lots of bad moves in relationships out of anger or strong feelings in my 20's and 30's.  I have come to this conclusion:  In the end, you have to ask yourself how much you value Love.  Are you willing to stand up for Love?  Are you willing to protect the one you Love, even from yourself?  Are you willing to risk going to the grave alone for the sake of Love?  In my mind, a man is only really worthy of Love if he can say yes to all of these questions.",1231978898

When a company makes a profit, it has basically two options - 1) re-invest some or all of the profit back into the company, or 2) divvy it up amongst the owners (ie. stockholders), which is more or less a dividend.<p>My old man runs a small business with about five stockholders. It's a mature business and he has no real plans for expanding, so every year he divides the company profits up between the shareholders.<p>You could sell your stocks to other people, but this would depend on the rules governing the buying / selling of shares as set out by the company when you acquired the stocks. Often this is just by agreement because there isn't a very liquid market for shares in private companies (for obvious reasons like lack of transparency and difficulties in valuation).<p>If I were to buy shares in a company, my valuation would depend on the company's earnings and the opportunity cost of putting my money in a ""risk-free"" investment (like treasury bonds)... which would dictate the base price-earnings ratio for which I would be indifferent to investing in the company or bonds.

Without prior knowledge of the problem, I feel inclined to believe the ""no causation"" camp. But I can also imagine that it is easy to select the proper studies to prove just about anything. For the book in question, how can I be sure that the author didn't chose to only quote the ""no causation"" studies, and not other ones that might come to other conclusions?<p>As I said, I would tend to believe the ""no causation"" camp, but I also don't have 100% faith in doctors...<p>Recently I was in a heated discussion with a friend about ""The China Study"", which claims that animal protein causes most of the worst ""civilization diseases"" like cancer and heart disease. At face value it sounds absurd, because it seems as if people have always been eating lots of meat (not sure if they really have, 150 years ago). So my friend completely rejected the possibility. The book sounded convincing to me, though - but at the end of the day, it is just one guy... At least I tried to Google for articles debunking the book and found none, but there is still a nagging feeling that one might fall for yet another diet scam (although as I said, the book really made a very solid impression on me). Just saying it is a similar problem, who is one to believe?",1231977960

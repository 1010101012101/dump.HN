7899700,comment,7898035,7899138,4,0,beat,,,"Speaking as an extrovert who is very comfortable talking to just about anyone about anything, I recommend reading classic books on good conversation as well (starting with <i>How to Win Friends and Influence People</i>). Even naturally talented communicators can benefit from studying time-proven analysis of <i>why</i> and <i>how</i> our communication techniques work.<p>For people with Aspberger&#x27;s or other non-neurotypical issues (and I suspect a lot of &quot;introverts&quot; in our industry are actually just self-conscious Aspies), treating human behavior and motivation as a game-theory kind of exercise can be more productive than a million baffling attempts at conversation. Turning the black box into a white box with known rules helps a great deal when it comes to grasping the inputs and outputs.<p>Look at it this way... would you tell someone trying to learn to program to skip the books and just <i>practice</i>? Computers are incredibly complex, and there are decades of theory and understanding captured in classic books that can put you ahead of the game. There&#x27;s a bright line between the learn-by-doing hackers and the engineers who take the time and effort to study the masters of the craft.<p>Humans are far more complex, subtle, and difficult than computers, and the masterpiece works of human behavior and communication are often centuries old. Study and be better!",1402934359

7899686,comment,7898035,7898035,6,0,anondog,,,"(Anonymous bc this is a <i>very</i> honest comment.)<p>I&#x27;m a massive introvert who spends most of his time coding, playing video games or Magic the Gathering, and my life has devolved 3 times into full-blown WoW addiction -- the fool&#x27;s gold life people take on when they feel their real one sucks.<p>I have almost no friends, <i>hate</i> making plans and, generally, would rather be alone. &quot;Hell is other people&quot; is my motto.<p>And of course, this lack of relationships makes me very sad sometimes. The short term desire to be alone leads to long term sadness.<p>But here&#x27;s where our stories diverge: I&#x27;m a tall, likeable (when I want to be), charismatic, good-looking, athletic white guy and can pick up women at will.<p>And yet, even though I can turn on the charm at will and get what I want (coincidentally, I&#x27;m a sales engineer), I&#x27;m still totally alone most of the time. This makes me feel like an outsider, an outcast, a loner, etc and the sadness can get uncomfortably dark.<p>So here&#x27;s my point: As someone said earlier it&#x27;s our <i>desire</i> to be alone that&#x27;s the real problem, not what you look like or what your accent sounds like.<p>Introversion is a constant sabotage of happiness. If you don&#x27;t maintain and work at friendships consistently over a long period of time, they will deteriorate. And doing that is nearly impossible for a &quot;hell is other people&quot; introvert.<p>The best solution, I&#x27;ve found, is to take the plunge and join a structured organization or group that you can&#x27;t easily get out of. Being in college, specifically a fraternity, was the best time of my life. It forced me to be social and interact with other people, even when I didn&#x27;t really want to. I think a healthy work environment with other people your age can help, too. It did for me.<p>One other note: I felt the same &quot;Why is everyone else out having fun and I&#x27;m not?&quot; feeling <i>very</i> profoundly in my mid-to-late 20s. It was a consuming, jealous, rage-inducing feeling. But now I&#x27;m 33 and I haven&#x27;t felt that in years now. I don&#x27;t even know why. Did I stop thinking that was a desirable thing? Or did I just give up?<p>TL;DR<p>1. Don&#x27;t blame your appearance or awkwardness. The real problem is your short term desire to be alone.\n2. Join a social or work structure that forces you to interact with others.\n3. The jealousy of others&#x27; social activity should dissipate with age. Mine did.<p>p.s. Also, get off of Facebook. People are only posting pictures of their happy times, so all you get is an artificial stream of happy happy happy. This will inevitably make you feel worse. Facebook image crafters are probably just as unhappy as everyone else. They&#x27;re working awfully hard to prove otherwise, aren&#x27;t they?",1402934183
7899684,comment,7899220,7899220,27,0,chollida1,,,"This has been going on in the HFT space for a number of years.  FPGA&#x27;s are used to parse data feeds as the sheer volume of quotes overwhelms most systems.<p>In fact after moving the networking stack into user land and using inifiniband networking gear, its probably the third most common optimization I&#x27;ve seen/heard of for HFT systems.<p>Here&#x27;s a quick, but surprisingly accurate description of a common HFT setup: <a href=""http://www.forbes.com/sites/quora/2014/01/07/what-is-the-technology-stack-like-behind-a-high-frequency-trading-platform/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.forbes.com/sites/quora/2014/01/07/what-is-the-tec...</a><p>Some one had asked about hte number of quotes that need to be parsed.  From forbes...<p>> Mr. Hunsader: The new world is now a war between machines. For some perspective, in 1999 at the height of the tech craze, there were about 1,000 quotes per second crossing the tape. Fast forward to 2013 and that number has risen exponentially to 2,000,000 per second.<p>Keep in mind that the &quot;tape&quot; is the slow SIP line that exchanges use to keep prices in sync and show customers that don&#x27;t use the exchanges direct feeds. ie it aggregates all the quotes from all venues and throws a way alot as they can&#x27;t be parsed in time or didn&#x27;t change the top level quote.<p>With 40+ venues at which a HFT fund can get feeds from 2,000,000 second is a fraction of what a cutting edge HFT would have to parse to keep up with all venues.<p>The typical setup is that you&#x27;ll run strategies across multiple machines so you have the gateway machine that directs the quote to the appropriate machine.  The biggest problem is the speed at which the quotes arrive.<p>Unlike a web request, that you can take 300 milliseconds to parse and return,  if you don&#x27;t parse and respond to the quote in under 10-20 micro seconds you&#x27;ve already lost.<p>So the FPGA transition is to make sure there is never a back log of quotes or any pauses in the handling of bursty quotes.  This can&#x27;t be overstated enough.  Margins are squeezed so tightly now that your algo will appear to be working fine until a big burst of quotes happen and your machines can&#x27;t keep up and when the dust settles in 20 seconds, you&#x27;ll find you lost $5000, which might be your entire day&#x27;s profit from that one symbol/algo pair.",1402934136

Being an immigrant it takes some effort on our side to assimilate in the society and for introverts like me (us) it takes a lot more.\nFirst thing I noticed is that I had a very low self-confidence. I&#x27;ve been an introvert all my life with only few friends.\nFirstly, what changed my life is getting a fitness club membership. It wasn&#x27;t easy in the beginning seeing all those big guys.  \nSo I used to exercise late nights after 11p.m only because i was too self-conscious. My first friend in the city was a cop, he used to exercise off hours.He taught me lifting weights and that changed everything. He was like a coach.He wasn&#x27;t like a friend i can hang out but that was fine.\nI felt better and better about myself as I got stronger.\nSecondly, I was a regular at start-up weekends and other business events .I made friends with couple of developers and business people. I was looking to make friends with them but they were only &quot;networking&quot;. Later, one of them asked me if I wanted to be his roommate so we can work on cool ideas together. Slowly, I became friends with his friends.\nAlso, I used to hang out at a 24/7 coffee shop and met other developers and designers.\nThirdly, I volunteered at a local animal shelter. I made friends while we walk the dogs and clean the cats :-) .I met my ex-gf there.\nAlso I read lots of books on the art of small talk and how to master conversation skills. Recorded my voice and practiced my accent until it got better.\nHey Read this <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culture_shock"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Culture_shock</a>.\nGood luck!!",1402934087

By adjusting the sign of the sign of the constant, you could produce a universe which was expanding, contracting, or steady-state. When Hubble&#x27;s constant got nailed down, that definitively meant that the universe was expanding, and Einstein was happy to accept that. The problem was that if you tweak the constant to produce that result, then it also says that the universe is not only expanding, but <i>accelerating</i>.

But if privacy is correctly understood, consent is usually irrelevant, and focusing on it is fundamentally inappropriate.<p>We do not, with respect to clean air and clean water, set the limits of tolerable pollution by consent. We have socially established standard of cleanliness, which everybody has to meet.<p>Environmental law is not law about consent.

7899453,comment,7895262,7895970,1,0,drabbiticus,,,"To add to andylei&#x27;s comment, I&#x27;ve pasted my own reply from Randal Olson&#x27;s follow-up article (<a href=""http://www.randalolson.com/2014/06/15/the-double-edged-sword-of-gender-equality/#comment-2051"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.randalolson.com/2014/06/15/the-double-edged-sword...</a>):<p>I agree that men and women most likely do make different career choices. Yet, choices aren&#x27;t made in a vacuum.<p>We have a culture that reinforces ideas of innate gender roles. Little boys are told every day that they need to be tough when they get hurt, that they shouldn&#x27;t be a crybaby. Little girls are told that they can&#x27;t handle rough housing, that math is too hard for them. Little girls are told they should be friendly and &quot;nice&quot;, that they should play well with others and build communities, mediate between friends. Little boys are told that they need to be responsible and be able to take care of people.<p>These attitudes are shifting. I am glad that they are shifting. When we tell boys and men that they have to be tough, we create a culture that makes it harder for men who are struggling with things things like depression and addiction to seek help or even admit that they have a problem to their friends. When we tell girls and women that they are weaker and less capable in certain fields, they begin to internalize those values. They begin to believe that they really aren&#x27;t cut out for it, that it is too hard.<p>There is a lot more that can be said on this topic, and to some degree it can be debated about just how &quot;innately&quot; different men and women are. However, the problem is that this viewpoint considers things in the aggregate. In life, you are an individual. That means that you should be able to deviate from what &quot;men&quot; are like or what &quot;women&quot; are like just because that is the way you are. So why do we tell little girls and little boys that they should be one way? If there is a difference between men and women, then we should be able to just let that difference exist, without trying to shape people to fit into our view of what those differences might be.<p>In general, as humans, we like to categorize things. This has been an immensely useful skill. It underlies most of our science and most of understanding of the world. It is fundamental to computer science since it allows us to do things like DRY (Don&#x27;t Repeat Yourself) and OO (Object-oriented). The problem is that when we see fields that are largely male dominated or largely female dominated, many people draw conclusions about what men and women are like. Relatively few stop to consider what societal pressures might have shaped the decisions of the people who enter these fields. They chalk it up to innate differences between men and women. And then they question people who don&#x27;t fit into those molds that they have created in their own minds.<p>Think back to those male nurses and female coders that we keep talking about. They don&#x27;t seem to fit into a mindset that says that men prefer to do things like code and women prefer to do things like caregiving. People express surprise and sometimes even censure because these people don&#x27;t fit. If we push men out of nursing, we have an even more female-dominated nursing population. We reinforce the idea that women are caregivers. Because why else would so many nurses be women? We&#x27;ve created a cycle. This is why I get concerned when the fields are so disproportionate. It&#x27;s not just that men and women are making different choices. It&#x27;s that we have created attitudes that reinforce those choices and make it harder for people to make different choices. It makes it harder for people to succeed when they make a choice that strays from our mental guidelines.<p>Again, sorry for the wall of text.

Figure out conversation topic... hmm, just got new job, ask for advice.&quot; Or &quot;Call Tony. Ask about his new car.&quot; Have a topic to start with and then see how things go.

You&#x27;d be using a smaller li-ion battery for the day-to-day drives.

With your eyes and nod of your head.  It takes an amazing amount of pressure off when you don&#x27;t have to walk up to someone to ask them to dance.

332852,comment,332819,332819,0,0,halo,,,"I apologise in advance as this is probably quite a controversial rant, but this sort of thing has always really frustrated me.<p>I guess it comes down to this: I don't see how sex matters when you're a business person, when you're programming, when you're building things. The sex of the person rightfully shouldn't come into it - it's their skills that matter. The interpreter, afterall, doesn't spit out a different result depending the sex of the coder - a computer is ultimately a great leveller. It has been a long fought battle to try and gain equality between the sexes and I firmly believe society is increasingly heading towards that goal.<p>And then when I read things like this it feels like a punch-in-the-face, as though it's saying ""equality doesn't matter when it helps women"". Or, even worse, there's perhaps an implication that women /need/ the help of other women to succeed and deserve special treatment. Or should I get ideas that there is some sort of conspiracy to form the inverse to the stereotype sexist ""men's-only club"" boardroom and there's some sort of attempt to reverse that through a ""women's-only club"". I loathe all these implications.<p>I've often wondered about this curious double-standard. There's previously been women-only discussions by Google in Computer Science at my University, but I bet there isn't men-only discussions in the psychology department, languages or other women-dominated social sciences and I think they'd be highly controversial if they did. Often an eyelid isn't blinked when someone offers something exclusively for women, but there'd rightly be uproar if someone offered it for men-only. I often wonder if the fact that men do significantly worse than women in exams (and as such University admissions) in this country would be quite such a footnote if the shoe was on the other foot.",1224033665

We have a small server room (3 racks, mostly full), but we don't have seamless failover and often we're without hot spares.  So, it matters that servers stay up.<p>With Google, it's not that big a deal.  They expect failure and so it simply becomes a calculation of what's worth more, the electricity or the hardware and I'm guessing the electricity would win out in that situation.  However, for us it's the hardware and the downtime and the hassle of setting up a box to support some ancient system some of which, no joke, date back to DOS days (or maybe I'm just really young and think that's old).

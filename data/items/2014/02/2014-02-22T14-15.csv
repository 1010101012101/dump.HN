It&#x27;s harder to spot this sort of error than a double goto and incorrect parentheses - because you have to check the code that throws and the code that catches.<p>Admittedly in the scenario I lay out - what happens is an error is thrown and not caught, rather than a check being skipped, but the net effect is equivalent - and it takes 1 character out of place to invoke.",1393081126

Convoluted checkout experience<p>Remember the last time you entered your name, billing information, shipping information and credit card number on a 4-inch screen?<p>The same cumbersome experience holds true for your mobile customers.

7282184,comment,7282005,7282063,10,0,Tloewald,,,"I hate omitting braces, but Javascript semicolon omission is a totally different argument. It&#x27;s easy to show simple cases where omitting braces causes problems. It&#x27;s actually quite difficult and artificial to find cases where (especially with &quot;use strict&quot;) semicolons confer any benefit at all, and in some cases they make things worse (e.g. multi-line variable declarations). Also, &quot;correct&quot; use of semicolons in Javascript makes code less consistent (e.g. some function declarations end with a semicolon, others do not) whereas consistent use of braces is consistent.<p>I certainly see far more bugs caused by an improperly inserted semicolon than an improperly omitted semicolon, but then I&#x27;m looking at jshinted code most of the time.",1393080831

7282162,comment,7281283,7281283,2,0,throwawaykf05,,,"expected, a post about irrational hatred generates even more irrational hatred. But that&#x27;s what you get when open source is your religion of choice. Since HN does not let me comment too frequently, I&#x27;ll just address these points in a single post:<p>1. &quot;Open source Bing/Windows&quot;: Yes, please, give away the things that took thousands of engineers and billions of dollars and decades to build. Look, I like open source and use entirely open source stuff at my day job and hobby projects, and even have open sourced my piddly crap that nobody uses on Github... but nobody is entitled to somebody else&#x27;s work for free. And damning somebody else for not espousing <i>your</i> beliefs is simply being a religious fanatic.<p>2. &quot;Antitrust/Monopoly&quot;: They were dinged by the US and the EU for essentially trying to turn their OS into a browser while having an OS desktop monopoly. They were trying to be ChromeOS before Google even existed. They were accused of leveraging their monopoly to enter another market but, as is obvious now, is that the desktop and browser market were one and the same. And then people insist that they &quot;missed the web&quot;! And after almost being dismantled by the US government for going that route, people are angry that they let IE stagnate!<p>3. &quot;Android patent trolling&quot; - They have an impressive patent portfolio (well, by the standards of most patents out there) and have every right to monetize it, which is how things typically happen in all industries. And as an early incumbent in mobile OSs, they did do a lot of work that modern smartphones still use, so it&#x27;s not like Android isn&#x27;t standing on the shoulders of WinMobile in addition to iOS.<p>4. &quot;API copyrightability&quot;: It&#x27;s not so much that Microsoft and Oracle are right on this, it&#x27;s Google that&#x27;s wrong. Google&#x27;s arguments as to why why APIs should not be copyrightable, taken to their logical conclusion, mean <i>no code ever</i> can be copyrightable. My take is they would be found copyrightable, but Google may probably prevail on fair use.<p>5. &quot;Scroogled&quot;: It&#x27;s based on surveys that shows people are not aware that gmail scans their email contents, and when told of this, most of them disapprove. And if the surveys don&#x27;t convince you, the class action &quot;wiretap&quot; lawsuits recently filed against Google are a clear indication that there are those who don&#x27;t like this. It&#x27;s perfectly fine to make consumers aware of their product choices, especially if it&#x27;s also in your business interests.<p>6. &quot;WebGL&quot;: There were <i>actual</i> security holes (DOS was just one hole -- the screencap exploit was much worse), and what Microsoft had said then was &quot;WebGL <i>in its current form</i> is not safe&quot;. However, as the standard was redesigned to address such issues (<a href=""http://www.techradar.com/news/software/applications/why-microsoft-decided-to-put-webgl-into-internet-explorer-1167110"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.techradar.com/news/software/applications/why-micr...</a>, search for &quot;CORS&quot;), MS has gone ahead and included it in IE 11.",1393080411

As a business you won&#x27;t have the time and exposure to others to remove the taboo.<p>Here&#x27;s why - individuals react to strong taboos without reason. You want to persuade people with reason.

You can find the &quot;embracers&quot; in spiritual sub-cultures, pop self help bookstores, health care workers, and elsewhere.

I had a windows touch screen phone 5 years before the iPhone and way before Google even existed. Microsoft was first out of the door there so it&#x27;s understandable they want patent revenue from prior inventions. I think that&#x27;s perfectly fair. Just because it costs your favourite company some money doesn&#x27;t mean it isn&#x27;t right.<p>2. Still bollocks. Caldera/SCO owned patents. Microsoft had Xenix and SFU out in production and wanted to avoid litigation as well. This was a pay off. The whole capital arrangement was similar to how most corporations bet on capital funds for pay offs. Granted it looked bad on paper. I&#x27;d understand if you listed the &quot;get the facts&quot; campaign which was nasty. SCO and their litigators and the legal teams were the only bad actors here.<p>3. They can&#x27;t pump out browsers as quick as the other vendors. They&#x27;re the only browser vendor that can offer a support lifecycle and paid up support. Google don&#x27;t give a shit about support. Mozilla close anything that isn&#x27;t easy to fix. I can phone up MS and get a paid fix in under a week. Not only that, most of these browsers are pushing broken shit out half the time and trying to get one over on the competition.<p>The whole browser market is a complete mess.<p>4. Typing this on a Nokia handset (Lumia 820). They have market differentiation with Windows Phone. They have a reliable stable platform, no fragmentation and a backer with more cash than you can imagine. Its sensible. Shareholders and staff for screwed yes, but what do you expect from a corporation. Just because they&#x27;re a brand you trust, doesn&#x27;t mean they aren&#x27;t populated by money grabbing assholes.<p>And Android is a royal mess. A fine example of fragmentation and a rave to the bottom. Google have really poorly managed the platform resulting in a rotting mess.

He called his biological parents &#x27;an egg and sperm&#x27;.<p>While this is probably obvious for most people, I don&#x27;t think calling Steve Jobs &quot;Arab&quot; is really of service to anyone. If you want to rise the profile of Arab Americans or Arabs in general there are a lot of great people to choose from.",1393078037

7282066,story,,,3,3,Inc82,"Ask HN:  App that helps pick a political platform/candidate, worth pursuing?",,"“Business as usual” is the name of the game for politics in a 2 party system.  The 2008 and 2012 elections convinced me that given the right tools and people the internet could produce a viable third party candidate for the 2016 presidential election.  As a programmer, I’d like to build a website that makes this possible.  Here is how I imagine this website functioning:<p>* Users vote up platform ideas within a variety of topics.  At a predetermined date the top ideas are coalesced into a platform document.  The voting platform remains open where platform modifications are suggested and voted upon before being merged into the platform document.<p>* Candidates are either nominated or directly apply to be candidates for this platform, agreeing to uphold the party platform to the best of their abilities.  At a given date no new candidates are allowed, and nominated candidates must confirm whether they would like to run or not.  Users are allowed to support 3 candidates for president.  At a predetermined cutoff date the list of candidates is narrowed to 10 based on the most supporters.    Candidates are expected then to produce a video describing why they believe they are a good fit to represent the users.   The list of 10 is narrowed down to 3 in a fresh round of voting.   Live debates are held using Google Hangouts on Air, and a final vote is cast to determine the party’s candidate.<p>* A signature campaign is run to get the candidate on all 50 ballots.<p>* A fund raising campaign would be fun for the candidate as well.<p>I believe that a Kickstarter campaign should first be run to raise money to build this website and to garner initial feedback and support.  With money from the Kickstarter, the website would be built, a timeline would be developed and wheels would be set in motion.  I’m wondering if you think this is a good idea and it is worth attempting?",1393077990

Who says it can&#x27;t be distributed and broken down in max wallet sizes of $50 or so. $50 is a common number no one should really care too much about.

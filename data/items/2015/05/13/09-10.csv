Some 20 years ago America was a symbol of civil liberties for us. I considered one day maybe going there to work and live. A few years ago I still entertained an idea of going there for an internship. Today I&#x27;d be scared to go there even as a tourist or on a short business trip.<p>Let&#x27;s say I go there. Then what? My cell phone and laptop can be confiscated at the airport for no reason. When I continue on to the streets I can be mugged by the police and get all of my money taken from me. And then when I go on without my phone or any money in my pocket, I can get killed in a mass shooting by yet another disgruntled worker who&#x27;s just been laid off or by a high school freak whose girlfriend has just left him. Or maybe I don&#x27;t get shot but then get sued by somebody for whatever reason and then I&#x27;m going to need from a few hundred thousands bucks to a few millions to defend myself in a court. Which will probably consider a Russian citizen a hacker and a criminal and pronounce me guilty anyway.<p>Sound like a true third world country to me. I&#x27;m not saying Russia is much better.

The characters are cartoonish without falling back on the crutch of cel shading; they&#x27;re realistic without looking like drab psuedo-photo-realism. To me they look like childrens&#x27; action figures, fighting it out on the screen.<p>Actually, Arc System Works ironically was the one who pushed the envelope here.<p>SF4 took a huge number of cues from Battle Fantasia. The &quot;Super-Attack Zoom-in&quot; animation, the dynamic camera movement, &quot;Super Freeze&quot;, and so forth.<p>Its ironic, because Arc System Works made Battle Fantasia as a &quot;learning project&quot;. In various interviews, Arc System Works noted that they had very little 3D skill and needed to train everyone up on 3D Animation skills, and the best way to do that was to make a 3D-animated video game.<p>Then a few years later, Capcom basically takes all the cues from Battle Fantasia and added a decent-style on top of it (the &quot;Black Lines&quot; and a unique style of cel-shading). And of course, Capcom&#x27;s SF4 cast was much larger, more detailed animation and all that. Nonetheless, it is clear that it was Arc System Works that pushed the envelope in their experiments with the one-off Battle Fantasia.<p><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZDJenxXPuM"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZDJenxXPuM</a><p>IMO, Arc System Works has done 3D a massive favor here with Battle Fantasia, and they are once again pushing the envelope with Guilty Gear Xrd.<p>Not to hate on SF4&#x27;s style of course. I think I prefer Capcom&#x27;s SF4 style over say... Tekken, DOA or even MvC3. And Capcom definite added a lot of &quot;love&quot; in the art-style. But the _core_ of the animation techniques were more or less copied from Battle Fantasia years earlier.<p>Super Smash Bros always had the right idea with the attacks however. If you watch SSB:M carefully, the bones of the various characters expand with the hitboxes. For example, Mario&#x27;s FAir attack has a <i>huge</i> exaggerated fist, and other characters shrink/ grow with their hitboxes. (Which adds for some interesting strategies / counter-strategies, since hitbox / hurtbox manipulation is a major element of high-level Fighting Games).<p>The Super Smash Brothers series has been the best at communicating the hurtboxes and hitboxes in a 3D environment. And it looks like Guilty Gear Xrd is finally a 2nd series that <i>finally</i> communicates those important cues as well.<p>----------------------------<p>Still, it is clear that the 3D Artwork style of SF4 is still relatively new and isn&#x27;t as a refined of artwork. Again, the Chun-Li animation from SF3 is near the peak of Capcom&#x27;s animation prowess, while SF4 is probably better described as a great first step for Capcom (even if it is in many ways copied over from Battle Fantasia).<p>Despite that fact, people are wow&#x27;ed by the the zooms, the buttery smooth animations, dynamic camera angles and automated shading. Things that honestly didn&#x27;t take much effort on the part of SF4 artists. Heck, all of those things basically come for free when you use 3D Models.",1431507873

It doesn&#x27;t require warmup -- that&#x27;s why it&#x27;s great for short command-line apps but other than that? It&#x27;s slower than Java, doesn&#x27;t have anywhere near the same level of deep monitoring, doesn&#x27;t have any live code loading capabilities, and has really bad interoperation with other languages. I use it when I need a simple script to run faster than Python, but a Java replacement??<p>> Both Java and C++ were getting quite long in the tooth<p>I don&#x27;t know if you&#x27;re aware, but OpenJDK&#x27;s JVM is not only the most advanced runtime environment around by a longshot, but the one that&#x27;s moving fastest with some really incredible research that&#x27;s gradually finding its way into production. Even Google is putting more effort into improving OpenJDK than into Go. The JVM is much more modern (in terms of new code and concepts being integrated into it) than Go (whose runtime is  almost primitive by comparison).<p>Go is a great solution for that middleground between a script and a &quot;heavyweight&quot; application, but let&#x27;s not compare its power to that of the JVM. It is a nice tool -- with excellent beginner friendliness -- but it doesn&#x27;t offer any technical breakthroughs.<p>As to Rust vs. C++ -- I&#x27;m hopeful, too, but like I said, there&#x27;s no we can know how big its impact is until it&#x27;s been used by several organizations in production for quite a few years yet.",1431507667

914903,comment,914662,914662,0,0,jsz0,,,"Windows 7 is a good OS for most people but I find it doesn't meet most of my needs. The OS has improved to the point where most of the issues are based on third party Windows software generally being subpar to OSX apps:<p>-Very hard to find free software that isn't spyware infested
-Bad GUIs in most apps -- lots of inconsistency on basic things like open/save dialogs
-Most of the apps are very bulky. Even a simple app has a ton of toolbar icons, tons of menu entries, lots of wasted screen space, etc
-Most Windows apps still include really low res ugly icons. Windows 7 looks nice but then you've got some 16x16 8 color icons or whatever in your Dock that look awful.
-Lack of built in tools (good CLI, SSH, X11 clients) 
-Doesn't interoperate very well with my other non-Windows systems (no NFS, AFP)
-Doesn't include a good backup system built in
-No easy way to update applications (like apt or sparkle on OSX)
-Still way too many popups, system tray icons, warnings, wizards, etc. 
-Not worth ~$100 to me. DRM makes it a bit too hard to pirate so I'll stick with XP in my VM
-The system wide search feature doesn't work inside of many common file types making it far less useful to me.
-Installing / Uninstalling apps is a bulky process with half a dozen clicks required in each direction.",1257069519

I've tried three different spam filters recommended to me by people I trust and who generally know about these things, and they get about 97% to 98% accuracy.  Worse, they produce false positives. With 50 spam per day, plus having to trawl through the spam bin to look for the false positives, I decided to write my own.<p>My spam filter is highly tuned to my traffic and I get about 10 spam through per day.  More, there are about 2 false positives per month, although that's very hard to quantify.<p>The problem with putting up a form is that people want a reply, and yet they can't type their own email address properly.  About half the emails I get through my various forms have subtle and not-so-subtle misspellings of the return address, and it can cost me hours to track them down.<p>No, obfuscated email addresses is still my best tool in this situation.",1257069096

Most of us -in the US- live far better than a <i>king</i> did two centuries ago.

914893,comment,914629,914858,0,0,bad_user,,,"Novell's Suse Linux Enterprise is hardly Mono/.NET related. And I don't know of any recent / remarkable developments coming from Red Hat.<p>They are known for Mono only because people have been bitching and screaming about it since the project started.<p>Novell is having a hard time because in the business of providing support for open-source products, there's no place for number 2. If you want to buy support for a Linux distribution, you either pay for the number one, which is Red Hat, or get Cent OS or Debian, relying on the huge communities behind them.<p>Merging Ximian with SuSE wasn't a good idea indeed. But at the time Gnome seemed like the better choice for corporate Linux, and IMHO it still is. Red Hat was using it, it's more stable and predictable, and you wouldn't need a commercial license to develop commercial software on top of it (like KDE at that time). The acquisition I couldn't understand was SUSE.<p>Betting on Mono does make sense. Developers and companies using dotNet are willing to pay for their tools, for their servers, and for support. They are even paying for add-ons to their IDE (like JetBrains ReSharper). So if you want to migrate to Linux, what's the best distribution for you? SUSE of course.<p>Unfortunately open-source doesn't sell well. You can use it as a catalyst for your other products, you can use it to gain market-share, you can rely on a community to bring improvements to your infrastructure (when you don't have the resouces for that), but making money straight out of open-source? That's not easy.<p>Miguel and his team are moving in uncharted territories ... they are in the process of releasing two commercial products for Mono ... MonoTouch and Mono Tools for Visual Studio. Both are quite interesting.",1257068719

In addition to having to catch a very wide scope of exceptions, I'm not sure you can actually ensure the ensure block executes.  (A trivial example: suppose I call out to library code that I don't understand and, for whatever reason, it calls exit.  The ensure block will <i>not</i> execute.  Granted, that would take care of my problem because the process was dead, but speaking generally, it is dangerous to assume that ensure actually ensures anything in generic circumstances.)",1257068037

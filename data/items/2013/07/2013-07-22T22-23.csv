ESPN.com now includes a lot of advanced metrics in their stats and last year in the Mike Trout vs Miguel Cabrera MVP race they discussed why Mike Trout was the favorite of the new school at length, constantly discussing his obscene WAR[1].<p>Nate Silver was ahead of his time on those advanced metrics but he was undoubtedly one of the pioneers. If people had been more receptive to his brand of statistics five years ago he likely never even goes into politics. Sports was his first love (along with poker, which he goes out of his way to not mention these days, unfortunately. He even obscured his username on the largest poker forum[2], so it would be harder to find with search engines).<p>Completely random thought that probably means nothing, but is worth noting: he&#x27;s openly gay[3]. With the tide on gay athletes turning sharply and quickly, I have to think that factored into his decision. Perhaps he is hopeful he can play a role in that, being the champion of the gay athlete or at least the one guy at ESPN they know will be on their side.<p>[1]<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wins_Above_Replacement"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wins_Above_Replacement</a><p>[2]<a href=""http://forumserver.twoplustwo.com/members/4548/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://forumserver.twoplustwo.com/members/4548/</a><p>[3]<a href=""http://gawker.com/5969477/sexually-gay-but-ethnically-straight-nate-silver-almost-gets-it-right-again"" rel=""nofollow"">http://gawker.com/5969477/sexually-gay-but-ethnically-straig...</a>",1374533914

They are all small, focused tools. This allows each program to focus on their particular task or domain.<p>The primary method of composition in unix is the pipe in a shell. Each pipe has two descriptors. One for read and one for write.<p>It is very easy to create a pipe and handle pipe IO.<p>The article:<p>At some point, djb wanted to have some programs live on the network. This expands the composition beyond a single machine. If you just try to treat a socket as a standard pipe, you encounter the problem he describes.<p>Any program utilizing a pipe requires two file descriptors. If someone built a trivial &#x27;netpipe&#x27;, they could just &#x27;dup&#x27; or &#x27;dup2&#x27; the socket file descriptor to make it look like a normal pipe. The problem with that is now the socket won&#x27;t close until both fds are closed. This means the remote end won&#x27;t detect EOF. This means the &#x27;netpipe&#x27; program has to be very clever in order to detect EOF and do a proper close on both so the remote can see the last bytes and then EOF.",1374533117

I was motivated to post by two things: firstly, <i>my</i> security system comes with a battery backup, and my sense is that this is a standard feature.  I assume if that didn&#x27;t provide useful additional security, it wouldn&#x27;t be a standard feature.  Secondly, if you&#x27;re going to have a side-by-side table that lists a bunch of ways your security product is better than the industry-standard product with which it&#x27;s meant to compete, as they do on their indiegogo (going so far as to call current technology &quot;broken&quot;), you should be honest if it does so by being less secure.

Not everything by Microsoft is a sinister conspiracy, sometimes it&#x27;s a garden variety screwup.  They were probably merely insular enough to ignore the rest of the industry, rather than arrogant enough to deliberately subvert it.<p>There is some logic to left-handedness, which is a bit more intuitive in some ways for computer graphics.  Left-handed means the Z coordinate increases with depth into the screen, that the viewer is somewhere near Z = 0 and looking towards positive numbers.  And projection space has 0.0 at the near plane of the view frustum and 1.0 at the far end.  Right-handed means that either your projection space coordinates go negative or that your projection matrix includes a negation for the Z coordinate.<p>Left-handed does however have the enormous disadvantage of working against almost all (non-computer screen) representations of 3D space.  Draw your X and Y axes on a sheet of paper in their customary orientation.  It&#x27;s much more intuitive to interpret positive Z as altitude above the paper rather than as depth into your desk.  That&#x27;s right-handed, and that&#x27;s why OpenGL and everyone else chose that.<p>Answering a different parent, it&#x27;s more than just one line of code in a library to change coordinate systems.  The depth buffer check needs to compare in the opposite direction, for one.<p>Incidentally, Microsoft has learned from this mistake: XNA uses right-handed coordinates.",1374531350

Numbers are a fun thing to show a viewer and to make comparisons with and I think ESPN is coming around to that (they developed their own QB Rating for football a few years ago).<p>That said, it also makes him an interesting counter to some sports pundits when there are invariably differences between the numbers and perception of players and teams. This will make for some good television. Heck, ESPN just started a show called &quot;By the Numbers&quot; a few months/years ago, so I think there really is a move to numbers-based analysis in sports.

I think it&#x27;s too early to speculate meaningfully about safe distances and danger levels when it comes to this technology, which as you correctly presumed doesn&#x27;t exist yet.<p>The press is hugely missing the point when they steam ahead using nonsense StarTrek analogies without an apparent clue of what&#x27;s (im)possible with today&#x27;s technology, but neither are the people in here getting it who are stuck lecturing each other about causality violations. This is not about speed or acceleration, or even the transmission of information. It&#x27;s about bending space time. Let&#x27;s not forget the enormity of that concept, but let&#x27;s also admire this potentially useful shortcut that might open up for us in the far future.<p>Current models are purely theoretical and work on a basis that is pretty similar to carrying a black hole around. Needless to say, in an age where we don&#x27;t even have the energy to reach Earth orbit economically, the power requirements of such a technology are nothing but prohibitive.<p>But even if we had enough power (and hence mass) to warp space by brute force, it would be a huge event that needs to happen far away from planets. While the general principle is interesting, I think what we lack is a more sophisticated method of modifying the properties of space time, something that works on a smaller scale and can be more easily contained. &quot;FTL&quot; neutrinos were interesting for this exact reason (before they sadly turned out to be a measurement error) because they would have opened a door for us to access and manipulate space itself without having to resort to enormous and ultimately wasteful energies.

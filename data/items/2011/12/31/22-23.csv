Also compute the sum of the length of the strings from 1-999999 while we're at it.<p>Then, run through the sorted array, keeping a running total of the length. Each time you hit a ""million-prefix"" string, it's easy to compute the total length of all the numbers that start with the prefix - it's just the sum of the string lengths from 1-999999 plus 999999*prefix-length.<p>If this subtotal doesn't push you past the 51B limit, then keep going. If it does, then run through the 1-999999 numbers only, adding each one to the total individually, until you reach the magic 51B mark.<p>The practical upshot is that you can skip millions of numbers at a time.<p>Ugly code here:\n<a href=""http://codepuppies.com/ben/ita/t2.txt"" rel=""nofollow"">http://codepuppies.com/ben/ita/t2.txt</a>",1325370952

Do you put up the money yourself?<p>Assuming you put up your own money it just isn't fair. The richest of us get more influence and the poor get none. It'll actually work a lot like the real US economy.<p>Then, if karma is worth money then wouldnt it make sense to be able to withdraw it and use it in places other than HN? So what if you get people hoarding karma then they withdraw it all and end up with one. Imagine some of the very well respected people here suddenly having no karma at all because they withdrew it and spend it on a new computer.<p>It's just not realistic and it defeats the whole purpose of karma. If it's only good on HN then it isn't worth money. The way it works now is probably the fairest way possible. If karma is one measure of the quality of a user's contributions and how much respect they have earned then making karma work like money would totally undermine its value. Right now, karma is earned. In a money scenario there are more chances to game the system and skew it both positively and negatively for a user.<p>If you want to give someone money then check out their profile and see if you can either donate to one of their projects through PayPal or Flattr or something or you can just send an email and ask.",1325369159

When I drive, my primary focus is on ""not dying"". Driving near Detroit every day, this is actually pretty hard. Can't wait to move to a city where car ownership isn't necessary.,",1325368931

Then when the machine tells them something is wrong, they freak out and think its broken, instead of moving their purse or hitting the ""I don't want to bag this item"" button.<p>Not saying this is your problem, but most people's problem is that they just don't pay any attention.",1325368854

The summer before, I read through an intro Python book and learned basic HTML/CSS. I enjoyed my intro course taught in Java, and will be taking a course in Scheme next semester. I also plan to start learning Django next semester.<p>I want to learn more about software development over summer. I'm wondering whether I should look for an internship, or study/build stuff on my own. Programming seems to be a field where I can learn a lot from watching someone do it, but I'm worried that I'll be assigned repetitive work in an internship and learn little.<p>Would you guys recommend for me to find an internship or learn and try to contribute to open source projects on my own? Thanks for any advice.",1325368827

He would hire maybe 25 experienced .NET developers to replace the 25 developers that left because they believe more in Java/Linux in the long term. He may have to let 10 developers go because they just don't want to learn anything new ...

I'd priced out using google maps for a service, and it was cost prohibitive.  However, so was bing maps, and getting a firm price from bing was even harder because my use case didn't fit in 'standard use cases'. In our case, apparently using a mobile app to add metadata to a location constituted 'asset tracking', which puts you in to a whole other level of pricing stratosphere.<p>I just get the feeling that many mapping apps out there that use google/bing/whatever are totally skirting the actual real pricing and use case terms, much like loads of people copy Photoshop.

I'm in pretty decisive disagreement with him on what he says about CS here, but there's a valuable point in here.<p>CS students, and engineers in general, are a little too dismissive of the liberal arts. There are some genuine reasons for this, but Zed is right in that it's supreme arrogance to think we have nothing to learn from thousands of years of human achievement in the arts. Ultimately, culture is how humanity expresses itself with the time and energy we've bought for it by making life easier with technological progress. Taking some time to understand the human condition through culture before we transform it would be a good thing.<p>Plus, on a personal level, meeting people who aren't fellow engineers is generally a good thing. Guys, there are a lot more girls outside of CS than there are therein... Hell, girls, that goes for you too if you just want to talk to another girl for once.",1275267580

I have a nice big screen, but NPR limits text to about a 3"" column.

We have `learned` python, C, Java and c++, so far. (I put the learned in quasiquotes because my classmates tend to completely forget the language after the course finishes.)<p>Sure, some courses like Project Management is completely useless, but I do study courses about machine learning, and how to design algorithms.<p>I'm now in third year and I feel that going to university to learn software engineering has made me a much better programmer than I would have been without it. Stuff like Object Oriented Design and unit testing, I wouldn't have gone and learned it myself... It would take a university to teach me that.<p>Funny... I was just having a discussion with my lecturer the other day... He was complaining the university's courses were too `theory` and didn't help students get jobs... especially compared to competing universities. I was telling him the point of university isn't to get students jobs but to teach them how to think. If students wanted a place to teach them so they can get jobs they'd just go to technical colleges. I think he was convinced... hopefully.<p>What about my commerce degree? Well its mostly boring but occasionally something really interesting comes up... like e-business and economics. I've only done commerce because my dad made me to.<p>The article makes me think though, maybe I should've gone for a Commerce/Science degree majoring in Mathematics instead.

Your failure to expose yourself to literature, art, poetry, science (real science, the icky kind) has made you stupid. Another data point against you is that you learned to code and you are questioning whether you can get something out of a university education. How arrogant can you be? There's nothing for you to learn from 2000 years of Philosophy, Biology, Physics, History? Nothing?! All you need is code?<p>This is inaccurate, but excusable since I assume Zed hasn't been to high school in a good number of years.

1391393,comment,1391309,1391309,0,0,jrockway,,,"Interesting.  But perhaps people switch from full-fat dairy to the reduced-fat versions after they realize they've made unhealthy eating choices that have already increased their risk of cardiovascular disease?  I also notice that ""low-fat"" foods tend to make up for the low fat in other ways, like by having more sugar and salt.  So people think they are ""eating healthy"", but they actually aren't; they're replacing a bit of fat and its soluable vitamins with high fructose corn syrup.  Not good.  (And, of course, they don't exercise.)<p>I also notice that people tend to lump fat from their cheeseburger into the same mental category as fat from things like avocados, peanuts, salmon, and olive oil.  But the monounsaturated fat from plants and fish is not particularly harmful for you, except that it's very calorie-dense.  Saturated fat is bad for you beyond the number of calories you get from it.  Unfortunately, dieters don't realize this, and buy their low-fat-but-high-sugar ice cream while eschewing ""high-fat"" salmon and peanut butter.  Which is bad for you.<p>(Personally, I drink 1% milk, but otherwise don't bother with ""low fat"" things.  But I do avoid sugar and salt, and that has had a measurable effect on my health.  I lose weight faster now that I don't put sugar in my tea, and my blood pressure has gone down since I stopped eating so much salt.

Many, besides MIT, do not.  They should teach everything from hardware architecture to compiler design to basic quantum computing in a decent undergrad program.  Some of those will be advanced options.  That's fine.  Depth comes at the cost of specialization, and every CS grad should have a tiny bit of depth somewhere.  The basic first year courses often do not assume knowledge of coding, but they should have a point <i>besides</i> learning to code.<p>I think better advice for students choosing a program would be to go to University, spend a year studying as many different things as you can, including CS, to see what engages you.  Learn how to code at the same time.  You might be happier as a physicist who knows how to code than a computer scientist who wishes he knew more physics.  There are plenty of coding jobs a CS grad can't do.",1275264562

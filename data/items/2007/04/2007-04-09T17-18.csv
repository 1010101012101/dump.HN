10886,comment,10771,10771,0,0,nurall,,,"It is very important for any Social News website to cater to the lowest common denominator. I agree with some of the comments here that suggest that a lot of people might feel alienated. <p>It would probably work to abstract out the IQ of the user from the user himself. This means NOT having an IQ test per se and instead using relevant data mining techniques to measure the knowledge of the user based off of the user's posts and the rating that the user receives. I guess knowledge is a more relevant criteria for most people to read a given post, unless you expect someone to solve/crack a problem, rather than add content. <p>But, at the same time, if the metric (could call it IQ or KQ??)) can be internalized, and used to group people together and in turn used to attract people falling under a given group, might be valuable. A notion of relative IQ (of groups) would probably be more relevant here. (Creating an e-harmony for people in the same group and cater to their needs based on a given metric)<p>I also agree that this will apply better in a domain specific platform more than other generic social content platforms, simply because it would be easier to measure a given user metric. So, it needs to be as domain specific as possible. <p>Is anyone working on this kind of a model? Definitely an interesting problem!!!",1176140746
10885,comment,10767,10767,0,0,mukund,,,"Open source tools, low cost on bandwidth and storage space have all triggered low cost and overhead involved in starting something. When you have a passion for what you are doing and costs are way too low, then any wise person would run it on his own. Now a days everyone knows that going to a VC or scouting for funds would lead to power struggle inside the company with the result being the founder getting kicked out. ",1176140670
10884,comment,10884,9243,0,0,vikram,,,"More than the need for different skills. I think as a single founder you have to be willing to wear all of these hats. <p>The big assumption that everyone makes with multiple founders is that everyone contributes and that the founders really know each other. Remember that your performance is averaged with others, so if the other founders aren't contributing, you still have the burden of reaching decisions with multiple people.<p>I find that with one founder its easier to divide work.

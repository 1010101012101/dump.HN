It's preposterous and sad that the Principal Designer on Firefox values the time of his users so little that he thinks a 7 minute unskimmable, unlinkable, unindexable, unexcerptable, bandwidth-heavy video (best viewed full-screen, lest you miss a pixel of detail or are tempted to look at some thing of lesser import) is a better way to communicate this change than some text and a few screenshots.",1277463553

By loading up my Bank of Ireland credit card, I could withdraw cash from ATMs at Mastercard's exchange rate, and no other fees (or with no loss at all if in Euro).

In that case, if you are providing more interesting work and/or better motivation, you can 'steal' some of the background processing from the other job, but the other way around is also possible.

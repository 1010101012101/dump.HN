(this is only re: presidential election) I live in NY, and democrats always taken NY state in presidential election just because they're democrats. Same with California. And in Texas, Republican candidate always wins because he's a Republican. There may be some exceptions to the rule, but very few.<p>So my vote didn't really count in the last election, because no matter how I voted, Obama would still win NY.<p>This is a product of a broken two party system that doesn't allow any non-asshole candidate to get elected. It's always a choice between a giant douche and turd sandwich.<p>Having said that, I still voted - for the third party, even though they had no chance. Maybe if one day a third party candidate gets enough voted something will change.<p>I think I'm gonna go vote for Jimmy McMillan now: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rent_Is_Too_Damn_High_Party"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rent_Is_Too_Damn_High_Party</a>",1288713561

A large fine for not voting would be unreasonable and universally disliked while a small fine would be ignored.  For example, we take the census, a short questionnaire, every 10 years.  Filling out the census is mandatory and the government makes a considerable effort to make sure that every household finishes their census form.

For a competently implemented hash map with integer keys, hash tables start beating linear search somwhere between n = 2 and n = 4.<p>At n = 4, you start needing more than one cacheline to do your linear search. Since a worst-case cache miss is around 300 cycles on a Nehalem, a hash function is very, very cheap price for near-certainty that you'll only probe one line of the structure.<p>All of which makes the table-pounding tone of this post kind of funny from 11 years' hindsight. The crossover point between linear search and hashing is a result of hardware and software parameters, not rhetorical force. He was right when he wrote what he wrote, and is wrong now. Future hardware/software changes might make him right again, but might not.

1860904,comment,1860117,1860593,0,0,TallGuyShort,,,"Speaking for myself, this is why I switched from Ubuntu to Fedora. Let me clarify that I completely understand why most users would prefer's Ubuntu's approach, and I'm sure there are ways to make Ubuntu work this way, but basically I just feel more comfortable on Fedora for these reasons:<p>- There's a huge amount of Ubuntu branding and renaming. I initially paid attention to this after the pretty silent updates that added ""Ubuntu branding"" to Firefox. I saw a lot of packages and applications that were renamed (or at least represented differently) to make them more generic. Personally, I would rather use the raw software and see the real names for the software packages. Fedora does this a bit too, but to a lesser extent.<p>- The interface is very polished, but I like having a very raw, stripped-down interface. I generally work quickly, and I can't stand it when the OS can't keep up. I like KDE, and this can be a memory hog, but Ubuntu's additions are even worse, IMO. It was getting harder and harder with each version of Ubuntu to get the interface where I wanted, and now that they're branching away from standard GNOME, I only see this getting worse.<p>- On that note, I was very unimpressed by Kubuntu, as it had obviously not received the same quality of attention as Ubuntu. As I prefer to use KDE and LXDE, I appreciate the very consistent quality between all the ""spins"" of Fedora.<p>- SELinux and hard-drive encryption work out of the box. Again, I'm sure I could get this running just fine on Ubuntu, but it's so much easier with Fedora, so this contributed to me just feeling more at home.<p>- The kernel had been modified a ton before it got shipped in a release. When I recompiled a kernel it wreaked havoc on some of the software that had previously relied on the added functionality. On Fedora I rebooted into a vanilla kernel and had no problems.<p>I realize some of these are pretty abstract reasons, but these seem to be directions they're heading more and more, so as I said, I just feel more at home on Fedora, now that I'm comfortable using Linux.",1288713015

That's framed as a big jump from the past, but say they make 4 x $175m or $700m a year.  Before this change, they would have made $688m per year.  So 12/688, or 1.7%, of their customers were being thrown off by the ""company"" field?  I find that hard to believe.<p>If, on the other hand, that $12m is added revenue, then (taking the article's $6.89b revenue per quarter figure) we have 0.044% of their customers failing to complete due to this problem.

If my vote were based on past performance of the parties, I'd only have considered Democrats and Whigs.<p>And if you're following along, you'll notice that the President credited with freeing the slaves was a <i>Republican</i>. How did that happen? Over time, the positions of the American parties have changed quite drastically. In the early 1900s, it was the Democrats who were backing big business. but the civil rights movement shuffled things significantly. Similarly, the (American) definition of ""liberal"" has changed significantly since the late 1800s. Back then, a liberal's ideas would correspond more closely to today's Libertarians or perhaps a small-government Republican.<p>My point here is that history can only have limited utility.

I'm one of the two guys behind DNSimple and I just want to take a moment to explain what you get and why I think that DNSimple is worth considering for domain registration and management.<p>First of all, the price of the domain varies from TLD to TLD. For a full price list of the supported TLDs you can take a look here: <a href=""https://dnsimple.com/tld-pricing"" rel=""nofollow"">https://dnsimple.com/tld-pricing</a> - the price list includes prices for registrations, renewals and transfers.<p>Second, our core business is really hosted DNS. You can use DNSimple without registering a domain through us. Some of you may say that either a.) I can use my current registrar's DNS service and it doesn't cost me anything extra (which is true) and b.) I can host my own DNS (which is also true). If price is your primary motivating factor then by all means go for the lowest cost provider for registration and DNS services. If, on the other hand, you want good, no-hassle service with a REST API and developers who actually give a damn about you working to solve DNS and domain problems you have, then I would hope you would consider DNSimple.<p>Finally, I just want to say that while I would love to be able to give out free domains, that simply isn't a realistic way to do business. For domains transferred out of GoDaddy right now I'm offering the domains at cost with the understanding that I'll be making some profit from the hosted DNS services. I won't apologize for wanting to stay in business and help people with their DNS, which is really what I want do.<p>Thanks again for the feedback, and please keep it coming. Feel free to tell me I suck or just walk away, it's all good. In the end I am confident that DNSimple customers will be thrilled with what they get and will know that they are getting something that is well worth the small amount they'll pay each year.",1288712531

Period. Keeping that in mind, we can logically conclude that you need either to monetize before the cash runs out (thus becoming organically cash flow positive) OR gather enough outside funding to support operations until such time as you become cash flow positive.<p>How do you get there? Well, ideally, you have a product that solves a clear need which can be monetized immediately. If not, then you need a product so compelling that you can get to X users in Y months (where X is an impressively large number, and Y is an impressively small one) -- thus attracting partners or investors.<p>But the bottom line is that you need to generate cash flow or generate funding as quickly as possible.<p>And yes, generally speaking, it's easier to keep a ""fun"" product alive in the Valley than it is elsewhere, if only because that's where most of the funding money resides, and because many of the potential funders there have more speculative appetites. Your odds of getting a cool product without clear monetization paths funded outside of SV drop significantly. That's not to say, of course, that getting a cool product funded in SV is easy, because it's not. You still need a good product, and by ""good,"" I mean a product that solves clear needs for its users or else provides its users with functionality or utility that solves problems users didn't even know they had.<p>Best advice for you is probably to take a job at a startup or larger firm, and build some cool products in your spare time. If and when one of those products becomes extremely cool -- and you'll know it when you see it -- that's when you start looking for users or for funding.

This thing is a disaster.<p>A reasonable cyclocross bike with fenders, lights, a rack, some panniers or a trunk box/bag would be cheaper, more functional, 1/8 the weight and made of inexpensive and easily-sourced components.  I don't get it.<p>My Trek 1200 is my main vehicle. It's a 4 year old entry-level road bike with a few hundred dollars of accessories added to it. I ride it 5,000 miles per year and never have any problems finding a place to put my jacket. It has twenty seven speeds, which might be far too many, but you could easily retrofit it with a Nexus 3 speed, Alfine 7/8 speed or some other high end gearbox like the NuVinci or Rohloff.<p>Many steel and aluminum bikes these days are also made (at least partly) from recycled materials.

1860661,comment,1860117,1860491,0,0,rwmj,,,"It's still slower than apt.  Partly this is the use of Python (an extremely unsuitable choice for this), and partly because the repository metadata is less space-efficient (stored as XML and SQLite database dumps).  It did get a bit faster around Fedora 10, so it's not painful.<p>The real problem with yum (and apt) is poor dependency solving.  This is an NP-complete problem sufficiently close to 3-SAT that a good SAT-solver can solve this way faster than the stupid Python/C++ heuristics in yum/apt.  I wish they'd switch to using something like zypper.",1288710128

If it meets your need, I don't see any reason why you wouldn't continue to use it. It won't work on every platform, but you say that's not a problem for you either. Go write some XAML. Personally, I find that it really is awesome for Windows Phone development.<p>As far as HTML / javascript goes, I'm beginning to get the impression that you don't like it. I understand, I actually hated touching javascript until I fell into JQuery. Even with it, I think developing javascript feels half-assed. But that's what the platform uses and modern browsers are generally fast enough. I tend to think of HTML as basically a display protocol though. It's ugly, but it works.<p>Take heart though, you can write the server side in whatever language you want, and your server-side can write your javascript for you.",1288710100

Due to improved techniques the elite will have greater control over the masses; and because human work will no longer be necessary the masses will be superfluous, a useless burden on the system. If the elite is ruthless they may simply decide to exterminate the mass of humanity. If they are humane they may use propaganda or other psychological or biological techniques to reduce the birth rate until the mass of humanity becomes extinct, leaving the world to the elite. Or, if the elite consists of soft- hearted liberals, they may decide to play the role of good shepherds to the rest of the human race. They will see to it that everyones physical needs are satisfied, that all children are raised under psychologically hygienic conditions, that everyone has a wholesome hobby to keep him busy, and that anyone who may become dissatisfied undergoes treatment to cure his problem. Of course, life will be so purposeless that people will have to be biologically or psychologically engineered either to remove their need for the power process or to make them sublimate their drive for power into some harmless hobby. These engineered human beings may be happy in such a society, but they most certainly will not be free. They will have been reduced to the status of domestic animals.<p>>127. A technological advance that appears not to threaten freedom often turns out to threaten it very seriously later on. For example, consider motorized transport. A walking man formerly could go where he pleased, go at his own pace without observing any traffic regulations, and was independent of technological support-systems. When motor vehicles were introduced they appeared to increase mans freedom. They took no freedom away from the walking man, no one had to have an automobile if he didnt want one, and anyone who did choose to buy an automobile could travel much faster and farther than a walking man. But the introduction of motorized transport soon changed society in such a way as to restrict greatly mans freedom of locomotion. When automobiles became numerous, it became necessary to regulate their use extensively. In a car, especially in densely populated areas, one cannot just go where one likes at ones own pace ones movement is governed by the flow of traffic and by various traffic laws. One is tied down by various obligations: license requirements, driver test, renewing registration, insurance, maintenance required for safety, monthly payments on purchase price. Moreover, the use of motorized transport is no longer optional. Since the introduction of motorized transport the arrangement of our cities has changed in such a way that the majority of people no longer live within walking distance of their place of employment, shopping areas and recreational opportunities, so that they HAVE TO depend on the automobile for transportation. Or else they must use public transportation, in which case they have even less control over their own movement than when driving a car. Even the walkers freedom is now greatly restricted. In the city he continually has to stop to wait for traffic lights that are designed mainly to serve auto traffic. In the country, motor traffic makes it dangerous and unpleasant to walk along the highway. (Note this important point that we have just illustrated with the case of motorized transport: When a new item of technology is introduced as an option that an individual can accept or not as he chooses, it does not necessarily REMAIN optional. In many cases the new technology changes society in such a way that people eventually find themselves FORCED to use it.)",1365501491

Non-confirmed users only write to their localStorage (so they can still use the app pre signup), but nothing (apart from their tiny user object) is synced to the remote DB, nothing is parsed by workers, etc. Then write a worker to cull unconfirmed user objects after a while, and you should be fine.

When I was at Microsoft, it was like ""hot potato"" to have to give up a coveted dev role and take on dev lead responsibilities. In particular, being a first-level manager was treated as a sort of curse with all of the worst bits --- not enough time to still work on big things (e.g. as a manager, I too owned logging for a while), but not high enough in the org to justify being full-time on hiring, coordinating teams, and fighting for 0.9 offices / headcount instead of 0.75.<p>Which sounds dumb until you're on a team with 0.9 offices / headcount and you see the productivity soar, for reasons I never bothered to quantify (if free fruit on Friday => productivity, just buy the fruit; don't ask).",1365500919

To term that a ""scam"" is an equally misleading. I don't believe it is fair that you cast aspersions without proof. ""Publicly shaming"" you is a wild accusation.<p>If I had put such a service together, I can imagine that I would search for a public API method that I could call, and if I received a response I would assume that the API was up, and vice-versa. The developer has mistakenly interpreted an error response code in the context of a user over access limits as an entire API failure. An automated script keeps running and gives incorrect results. That's an oversight and not a scam.<p>I think you would have been better to try to get an explanation from Verelo before publicly shaming them. They might have worked with you to correct the problem.<p>By the looks of the <a href=""http://whatsdown.verelo.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://whatsdown.verelo.com/</a> website, the vast majority of the sites appear to have valid uptimes. Yours is the primary exception. That suggests to me that this truly was an oversight, otherwise they would have been trying to extort other services in the same way.<p>Contact Verelo, and ask them for an explanation. If the explanation is valid and they correct the error, then I think they deserve a public apology from yourself.<p>On a side note, it might be useful for all public APIs to offer a standard /status call, which returns a standard response. In that way, services like these, which do have some value, could operate in a standard way without upsetting the API owner.",1365499327

First is that you are unlikely to ever work on a fully self-contained task that doesn't require collaboration with other people. As such having shared work hours is required. Second issue is that of trust. In common tongue ""working from home"" means ""sleeping in, sitting on a couch, going for two hour lunch breaks, etc"".

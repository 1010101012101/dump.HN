They say &#x27;Personalwechsel&#x27; and control the tickets again.<p>You don&#x27;t need a passport, visa, or whatever to buy a ticket and no train crew is controlling your passport. They are also NOT authorized to see your passport. If you don&#x27;t have a valid ticket, they will ask for your passport for identification purposes. You don&#x27;t have to show it. They will then call the police, which you then HAVE to show your passport.<p>The train crew only looks at the passport, if you used it online to buy a ticket, using the passport number as an identification number. So they check the online ticket and look at the passport number. But you can use other ways of checking for a correct online ticket (using your credit card number for example) and you can buy your ticket also offline.<p>It also does not matter for 505 million EU citizens. The police may control your passport. But that&#x27;s it.<p>ALL 505 MILLION EU CITIZENS ARE ALLOWED TO TRAVEL AND WORK IN GERMANY WITHOUT VISUM.<p>Details: <a href=""http://ec.europa.eu/social/main.jsp?catId=457&langId=en"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ec.europa.eu/social/main.jsp?catId=457&langId=en</a>",1408867196

8217985,comment,8217565,8217967,2,0,morgante,,,"> &quot;Denmark, which decriminalised prostitution in 1999 – the same year Sweden made the purchase of sex illegal - has four times the number of trafficking victims than its neighbour despite having around half the population.&quot;<p>That&#x27;s not very strong evidence. It could easily be that the sex industry in Denmark was thriving pre-1999 and floundering in Sweden (with policy choices & trafficking as results).<p>Better proof would be comparing the growth rates in trafficking between two countries with similar base rates, where one legalized and one didn&#x27;t.<p>Intuitively, I hope you can understand why many people think legalization can be a great tool for combatting trafficking. By doing so, you move the sex trade out into the open and away from gangs/criminal syndicates and allow for regulations which can serve public health & anti-slavery purposes.",1408867166

Navigating on to the homepage of the application, the author (of MacDown) writes more about the reason there. Apparently, the author of Mou, wants to stop developing Mou and sell the project and the author of MacDown didn&#x27;t have the cash and decided to write an open source clone of it instead.<p>&quot;<p>Why Another Markdown Editor?<p>I like Mou. I write Markdown all the time, and since I use OS X on a daily basis, Mou is my go-to editor whenever I wish to generate something with markup. But I had always wanted something more.<p>It came as a great shock when Chen Luo announced that he felt he could not actively continue the development, and wished to sell the ownership of Mou. No suitable offers surfaced (I honestly do not think there will be, either), and I decided that instead of waiting for others to do something about this, I should act myself.<p>I don’t have nearly enough money to match Chen Luo’s purposed offer, but I do have my own pocket of tricks and some free time. So I started from scratch, spent some weekends hacking together my own solution.

8217977,comment,8217565,8217812,3,0,ubernostrum,,,"Anecdotally, I spent most of July traveling around western Europe, entirely by train. Passing between other Schengen countries? No problem, you don&#x27;t even know you crossed a border unless the conductor announces it. But at the German border the train stops, the crew is changed, sometimes the locomotive is changed, and on one train the police came on board at the border and asked to see everyone&#x27;s identification. Other countries, the crew also just checked tickets shortly after boarding, then marked down &quot;checked that seat, they&#x27;re going to this place&quot;. Of the multiple trains I took in Germany, only one did that; the rest had the crew checking <i>everyone</i> after every major stop, to the point that I finally just left my ticket sitting in my lap so I wouldn&#x27;t have to keep getting it out of my bag.<p>So I would say that of the countries whose borders I crossed -- Germany, France, Belgium and the Netherlands -- Germany was by far the one with the most border controls. In fact, it was the one that <i>had</i> border controls.<p>(also the German trains had the highest rates of delay and malfunction; I did one six-hour trip to Berlin on a train which had no food available, and another six-hour trip on a different German train where the air conditioning didn&#x27;t work, on a sunny day over 30C, and missed a connection to a TGV because the ICE was running nearly 30 minutes late)",1408866465

8217953,comment,8216865,8217553,5,0,fchollet,,,"> Everything from Machine vision to natural language processing to speech recognition, is benefiting from this. We live in exciting times for AI, and everyone wants to get in on it.<p>Not &quot;everything&quot; is benefiting from multilayer CNNs; in fact their use is limited to a tiny fraction of machine learning problems. The majority of data problems in the industry involve small datasets with a limited number of dimensions; picture classification and speech recognition are outliers in their scale, although they are extremely important problems.<p>Also, the fact is that multilayer CNNs are not a recent development, even though the catchy term &quot;deep learning&quot; is. The recent development that has brought us significant performance improvements in image classification and speech recognition is mainly to put CNNs on GPUs, allowing us to scale the networks considerably. So you could say that what is going on here is really hardware progress, not any kind of theoretical breakthrough (there is surprisingly little theory behind multilayer CNNs).<p>At last, improvements over the state of the art on a number of large-scale ML problems is not the reason there is so much hype about &quot;deep learning&quot; (which is really the same kind of shallow learning that we&#x27;ve been doing for a while), both in the mainstream media and in the tech community. We have entered a new AI summer, where algorithms that have been around for decades are being hailed as being the &quot;real deal&quot; that works just like the brain (nope).

Somehow I don&#x27;t think investors will see much of a return on that money.<p>This is all nice and good, but after summer comes winter. The hotter the summer the darker the winter.

Are we reading the same Constitution? There&#x27;s only one instance of the word in there and it&#x27;s talking about IP (&quot;To promote the Progress of Science and useful Arts, by securing for limited Times to Authors and Inventors the exclusive Right to their respective Writings and Discoveries;&quot;). The understanding of IP law that I&#x27;ve seen is that American patents don&#x27;t apply internationally: they have to be converted over to the other governments&#x27; systems.<p>> It&#x27;s also in the spirit of the declaration of independence that &quot;all men are created equal&quot;, which would lead one to believe that they all have certain inalienable rights, citizen or otherwise.<p>This is the same Declaration of Independence that didn&#x27;t bother including slaves and women as &quot;men&quot;, yes? Just to be clear on what the &quot;it&quot; you&#x27;re referring to isn&#x27;t being changed by modern times.<p>> It also doesn&#x27;t mean that Russians are subject to American law (at least not while in Russia), but that for things such as rights, they apply to everyone.<p>The essential claim here is that rights granted by American law apply to Russians.<p>What you&#x27;re not saying, but perhaps are <i>meaning</i> to say, is that there ought to be legal structures that transcend national boundaries to apply to the entire human race and that we can in turn derive American law <i>from</i> such a structure such that there are situational effects at a national level. The UN, and the UNDHR, come closest to this but American law does not recognize the UNDHR as anything but a set of suggestions. Judges do not use it as a guideline. Legislators do not use it as a blueprint. (And further, the UN does not have in its membership the entire human species.)<p>That would make sense. It would reduce Americans&#x27; sense of sovereignty, and thus would be fought tooth and nail by the xenophobic culture you reference, but it would then make sense to talk about universal human rights.<p>It&#x27;s funny. I&#x27;ve been of the mind for the past decade and a half that we need a species-level government precisely in order to achieve effects like this, but it&#x27;s also specifically the people who want these effects who are most horrified at the prospect.<p>So perhaps that&#x27;s <i>not</i> what you&#x27;re meaning to say.

I&#x27;ll stipulate up front that I&#x27;ve never worked as a government employee, and despite doing some assessment work (like being hired to break into the Department of the Interior without their knowledge, or breaking hardware/software that was being deployed in far away places) everywhere I&#x27;ve worked has tried very hard to steer clear of government work (not for any ethical reasons, it just pays much worse than equivalent commercial work, and is almost always boring).  In fact, the last two places I worked had distinct government and commercial divisions (where I ran the commercial divisions).<p>That said, I&#x27;ve built and run several security consulting practices in the DC area, and consequently have done hiring interviews for dozens of people who were NSA employees (1 of which we ended up hiring). Absolutely none of them have even the slightest apprehension about the nature of the work they were doing (so much as they were able to comment about it during interviews).<p>In fact, prior to the Snowden leaks, the NSA was pretty much at the bottom of my list for government agencies doing shit I disliked. They have a pretty clear scope and charter (which we&#x27;ve come to learn has been muddied).<p>But no one I&#x27;ve talked to, either who works there or works at a contractor in the DIB, thinks they&#x27;ve done anything wrong.  Did you read those batshit NSA talking points that came out yesterday from Al Jazeera&#x27;s FOIA request? They believe those things.<p>They think they&#x27;re doing important, valuable work to protect the country. I can only imagine that internally within NSA there has been dissent about some of the stuff that&#x27;s come out. Maybe people have resigned over it, maybe they&#x27;ve sent strongly-worded emails to their bosses.

There&#x27;s no middle in terms of ideology. Doing nothing is de facto maintaining the status quo, and acting to maintain the status quo is a positive action just as much as acting to abolish it is. The belief that the status quo should be maintained is a positive belief just as the belief that it should be abolished it is. Right?<p>The thing is, by the very nature of ideology, those who wish to maintain the status quo rarely have their beliefs subjected to the same level of scrutiny as those who to abolish it. Therefore it is very easy for those who wish to maintain the status quo to believe that their beliefs and actions are sane, rational, reasonable, etc., because everything seems to reinforce that, while those who wish to abolish it are often portrayed as insane, irrational, extremist, etc., and as someone who does wish to abolish the status quo, it&#x27;s very hard not to internalise some of that. Being constantly bombarded with that, having all of your beliefs constantly scrutinised from every angle inevitably manifests itself as incapacitating self-doubt that&#x27;s very difficult to overcome sometimes. Sometimes the only way to cope with this is to temporarily suspend this constant questioning of everything you believe in.<p>It is far more common that people who wish to maintain the status quo are slaves to dogma than that people who wish to abolish it are. Often, the latter do not have a choice about whether or not their beliefs are rigourously questioned every five minutes. But the former can comfortably go their whole lives without ever having their beliefs rigourously questioned by anybody.<p>Edit: I think an NSA agent participating in these programs out of a belief that they are serving their country and who refuses to question what serving their country actually means is a slave to dogma. I do not think that somebody who believes that their communications should not be monitored or recorded without their consent and who refuses to question that belief is a slave to dogma.",1383264693

I like how you&#x27;ve integrated a specific UX into the Product. Right now the Signup is probably one of the most important aspects to focus on (as you onboard Users). Choosing to skip E-mails (and E-mail verification) for a faster signup lowers the entry point barrier and makes the UX more enjoyable. This is something I&#x27;m currently working on with my App (the initial Signup Process). I&#x27;ve performed some customer validation and the results were in line with my assumptions. The preferred experience seems to be minimal time investment, and minimal effort. Following this train of thought, here are few basic options:<p>1. User manually inputs an E-mail Address and Password (commonly w/ E-mail Verification)
2. User manually inputs a Username/Password (less to type, no Verification needed)
3. User taps twice and uses Social Media Integration (example, Facebook Login)<p>Of course each of these has Pro&#x27;s and Cons. I will follow Popcorn and see how it works with the second option. I&#x27;m leaning towards the third option (minimal time investment), but I&#x27;m concerned about perceptions of the associated Social Network(s) and how that might impact the User&#x27;s desire to create an account. For example, if a certain Network is &quot;not cool&quot; with the younger generation, and you present the &quot;not cool&quot; Network as the Logon method, would that make the App also &quot;not cool&quot;?",1383264610

The people have far more ability now to keep their communications secret than they have <i>ever</i> had before. It makes no sense to say that the individual has either less or the same ability to keep their communications secret. PGP has been around how long?<p>The fact is that people don&#x27;t care. Maybe they will in the future, but I doubt it given the rise of mobile and its corresponding dependence on the cloud.",1383264453

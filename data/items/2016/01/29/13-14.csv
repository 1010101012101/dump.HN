I&#x27;ll summarize his definition because I found it interesting and challenging:<p>He begins by stating that it&#x27;s now widely accepted that anything can be viewed as art. Seeing as that&#x27;s an infinitely broad definition, he goes on to describe the following “scorecard” for what counts as art. A “yes” means it&#x27;s more likely to be art:<p>* Is it in a gallery or an art context?\n* Is it a boring version of something else? Does it lack entertainment value?\n* Is it made by an artist?\n* Is it limited edition?\n* Is it admired by hipsters?\n* If you put it in a dumpster, would a passer-by wonder why an artwork had been thrown away?\n* Does it detain and suspend us in a state of frustration and ambivalence, making us pause and think rather than simply react?\n* If it&#x27;s a photograph that&#x27;s smaller than 2m and costs less than five-figures, then it scores negatively.<p>He says that the above tests aren&#x27;t watertight, but if you put them together in a Venn diagram, the bit in the middle (the bit to which all the answers are yes) is pretty well guaranteed to be contemporary art.<p>I dislike the definition, but I wonder if it might be accurate. When I try to come up with a better definition, I wonder if the concept I&#x27;m trying to describe is something else—what art _should be_—not what art is.",1454075646

Swipe text behavior is worse: doesn&#x27;t automatically add spaces it used to (especially near other text), no longer works at all in the browser&#x27;s URL bar, aggressively gives up on words even after displaying them, and deletes things one character at a time even though the errors with swipe typing are never spelling but instead the wrong word being selected. There are other issues (live tiles are unnecessarily animated without giving information in return, for instance), but I think the way they destroyed typing is the worst impediment.<p>Windows Phone 8 already made the camera worse by removing the ability to quickly focus and take a photo, but at least swipe text was one improvement over Windows Phone 7&#x27;s tapping only text behavior.<p>I&#x27;m going to just order the battery and return this phone.

10995110,comment,10978685,10980134,0,0,boyaka,,,"On the topic of shoes, I recommend the Vibram Five Fingers, but there are some caveats involved. The main issue I have had is blisters (mainly on my big toe and the ball of my foot). For me wearing socks are a must (the injinji socks are great, but I found other toe socks at uniqlo that work just fine). Shoe size is a tricky thing, and some styles are definitely better than others in regards to comfort (I bought a pair I don&#x27;t use at all because there is so much more friction on the areas where I get blisters). One of my feet is bigger than the other, and the general recommendation is to go with a snug fit, but on my bigger foot the big toe was poking into the end, and I feel like this messed up that foot a bit. I&#x27;ve since bought a pair of the larger size and I use my original pair on my smaller foot, and the new pair on only my bigger foot. Based on my experience too short is bad, and in general too large is probably bad because of the added friction.<p>Also, running barefoot style takes a lot of getting used to in regards to form. Keep your runs short at first so you can develop muscles that help you keep good form. Running in bad form exacerbates the blister issue and potentially can lead to other injuries. I&#x27;ve had some issues with my knee where the ilio-tibial band connects on the outside, but some stretches for that muscle have alleviated that issue, and my main limitation has been the blisters. As far as the blisters go, as long as I stick with a consistent running routine, don&#x27;t overdo it and keep good form, they tend to be less of an issue. Also after having quite a few my skin has now started to toughen up. Combination of tough skin from healing a bunch of them, good form, and better shape and I think I will be able to run indefinitely without them being a problem.<p>The reason I switched to these shoes was because when I started running I would go through a $100+ pair of running shoes in less than a year. I would have problems with the cushioning in them becoming imbalanced, and a lot of pronation. This actually caused some legit injured feet for me and lots of foot pain that kept me out of running completely. Although there was the knee pain and the blisters with the five fingers, overall my feet feel great and the pain is nothing near what I had when I ran in regular shoes.",1454075208

As in, a literal bar, because to stay an MVP it sure seemed like you had a lot of parties to go to so you could make the right person laugh at the right time.<p>I ran the largest online community for SharePoint users at the time, and was awarded because of that. I think 7 years total? Maybe 8? I spoke at an internal sales conference (TechReady, where it was suggested I cover up the glowing apple logo on my laptop, and I made anti-FrontPage jokes - that were, incidentally, approved by PMs in the FrontPage team!), and was asked for input on several features. Later, my community outreach was deemed less important, because I wasn&#x27;t contributing to the official newsgroups. The input MVPs gave came too late in the cycle to have any effect. I wasn&#x27;t the type to enjoy pub crawls, so the networking that became a de facto requirement to continued participation was out of my reach. The program grew to include people whose only motivation to join the ranks of MSMVPs was to get early access to software and to curry favor with some PMs or RDs. Several of us started to see it becoming a &quot;good ol&#x27; boys club&quot;, and we knew our days were numbered.<p>Another former MSMVP (who also didn&#x27;t play the reindeer games, as we called it) is now my business partner. We both occasionally miss the camaraderie of the summits, the opportunity to (we naively thought) influence the direction of SharePoint, and the relevance that the little blue and silver badge had. MSMVPs (at least in our product) were once seen as leaders and ombudsmen simultaneously, and now they&#x27;re seen primarily as a way to score free drinks at a conference. We miss the olden days, and wish for the program to mean what it was supposed to mean.<p>I never really wrote all that out before, never really came to terms with the loss I experienced when I found out that I wasn&#x27;t renewed. It didn&#x27;t diminish my evangelism for SharePoint (we still train and consult), but part of me wonders if my pragmatism, my willingness to be brutally honest when SharePoint didn&#x27;t make sense, and my quiet protest at being asked to focus on MS-official communities contributed to that. Not wonder, actually. That&#x27;s not the right word. I&#x27;m pretty sure all those things contributed to it.<p>I guess I wonder if there was anything I could&#x27;ve done to effect change in the MSMVP program, to make it something where our opinions actually mattered. I&#x27;m not bitter about it. I was, but I got over that in a hurry. Now, I&#x27;m just sad.

All the real kudos go to @jcmvbkbc who quickly implemented esp8266 support in GCC and maintains it well since then. My little project just makes his and other work accessible to almost everyone who can type few commands in a terminal, with as much as possible build from source (and thus available for tweaking).

5765646,comment,5765270,5765270,52,0,tikhonj,,,"I don't know--my impression is that most people go to far in the <i>other</i> direction. They write code with no thought at all for the future, and then shortly have nightmarish debugging sessions in spaghetti code that's impossible to extend or reuse. All in the name of a rather extreme ""worse is better"" philosophy.<p>I've certainly experienced this with some of the people I worked with recently. Anything you win in the short term gets lost several weeks--if not <i>days</i>--later when everything is a horrible mess. Don't even think about coming back to that code months later!<p>I've found that putting in a little bit of care for the future pays off even in the short term. Perhaps not on the scale of hours or days, but definitely <i>weeks</i>. Which is still pretty immediate.<p>However, <i>how</i> you do this is also very important. The handy rule I've been using is simple: simplicity. Improve your code by making it do <i>less</i> not <i>more</i>. If you can make code more maitainable or general by simplifying, do it. If it would require adding new concepts or mental overhead, reconsider. Try to reuse existing abstractions as much as possible.<p>This usually--but not <i>always</i>--means making your code more functional. Do you really need to write this operation in place? Do you really need to tie everything together with a bunch of implicit state changes? Probably not! This is not to say that you should <i>never</i> use state: just be sure to only use it when it fits well and makes sense. And be explicit about it.<p>The functional style (at least in languages like Haskell) also lends itself very well to reusing simple and general abstractions. The key idea here is that these abstractions are <i>not</i> about doing more: they're about doing <i>less</i>. More general code simply leaves you less room to make mistakes. If you're working with lists of numbers, there are all sorts of arithmetic mistakes you can make; if you manage to write the same code against lists of <i>anything</i>, the only mistakes possible will be in list handling.<p>Haskell just makes this more practical by providing abstractions with a great ""power-to-weight ratio"": ones that manage to be simple, general and yet still expressive. Code with functors or monoids or traversables is easier to write than more concrete code and yet still flexible enough for many useful tasks. As a bonus, it's also more reusable. For free.<p>So the key idea is reduction: all these abstractions work by <i>stripping</i> concrete types of power. A functor can do much less than a list. A monoid can do much less than a number. This lets you write nicer code without becoming an ""architecture astronaut"" because instead of adding structure, you're really taking it away.<p>I've found that programming like this <i>really</i> helps in maintaining and extending the code later on. But it doesn't slow me down when I'm writing either--I actually <i>save</i> time because I spend less getting time getting the code correct in the first place.<p>These days, I've started being able to make large changes or add complicated features and have them work on the first try. Not every time, but surprisingly often. Certainly much more often than before! In large part, I think this is because of writing the code with an eye towards simplicity.<p>So the important insight: take the <i>simple</i> route, not the <i>easy</i> route.",1369435882

We knew that once it worked, wed be in a better position to think of what we really wanted. --<p>Next time youre stuck, just write the simplest thing that could possibly work!<p>-- So when I asked, Whats the simplest thing that could possibly work, I wasnt even sure.

There is a real risk in freezing up when you attempt for your first writing of code to be the fully architected solution.<p>I would still go one step further and at least apply the strategy pattern/polymorphism when you have a large if/else/case block going beyond 2 or 3 conditions in a controller or model or something. (assuming MVC web apps)<p>The fact is you can write out some ugly code directly in a controller where it might get some code working fast and prevent the freeze up of your output, but once working you should immediately move it to the appropriate place like a model or library, and apply a basic OO strategy pattern (perhaps not with factory/interfaces etc until needed later) where appropriate to cut down on spaghetti/nested conditionals.<p>This really does not take much more time than stopping at working code that is ugly, and is a good middle ground where it is not painful to return to later.<p>There is still no good excuse for ""taking a dump in the corner"" of your code base just to get a marginal gain in output.",1369434815

My optional life changes were:  my wife and I decided to have our first kid and we wound up with twins, and started an overly painful re-fi process on the house, and spent 24 months trying to get a new job in town so I wouldn't have to travel as much for work.<p>The burnout I suffered seemed cataclysmic for my startup idea.

I'm getting old, now with kids; I'll never be able to make anything out of this thing, I waited too long...

Nobody ever uses it, though. Probably because it saves you nothing over just using JO (jump on overflow) after every arithmetic instruction, which itself has so little cost (overflow doesn't usually happen, so the branch will almost always be predicted) that many languages have compilers that already do this by default.<p>But C is a terribly primitive language. If I remember correctly, unsigned integers don't really have overflow; the result of any arithmetic operation is supposed to be modulo whatever the maximum is. UINT_MAX + 1 is required to be 0. Signed overflow is supposed to be undefined, but I suppose C programmers care more about saving one instruction plus a usually-predicted branch than they care about making programs more reliable. Of course, a lot of programs depend on signed integers behaving just like unsigned integers, so fixing this would be painful.",1369433998

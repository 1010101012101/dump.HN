23001,comment,22959,22961,0,0,leisuresuit,,,"reddit got its first users because Paul Graham linked to it. Remember it was a yc company. They were getting something like 3000 users a day in the first days. To me it seems that's the best reason to be a yc company, because you trade some share of your company to get free press and free traffic. Which is kind of expensive if you don't get it for free.<p>In your case I would perhaps consider finding a partner or something to link to you.

22998,comment,22642,22922,0,0,martin,,,"No. The problem isn't that juwo is a ""new concept."" In my opinion, your response to the previous post is demonstrative of your problem:<p>He said: ""I don't understand what your product is.""
You said: ""juwo has X functionalities and Y use cases.""
You didn't say: ""juwo is a product that solves __(problem)__ for __(audience)__ by __(10 words max describing functionality)__.""<p>_That_ is what people want to know when they ask about your product. _That_ is what needs to be on your home page, not 13 use cases and 300k of screenshots. For a product to be successful, it has to have a purpose. It has to solve a problem that somebody has. <p>I've been following your threads on news.yc for weeks, and I still have no idea whether your product has an actual purpose or is a useless collection of features. If the former, you need to do a much better job of communicating this to people. Otherwise, it's time to revisit the idea. Nobody's interested in a pile of useless features. And if you don't believe me, perhaps I could interest you in my tax prep software which organizes your photos and generates source code for text-based adventure games for the TI-83...",1179472991

22994,comment,22876,22876,0,0,dhouston,,,"is the problem that they don't like the idea, or aren't willing to give up their day job?<p>if the latter, i've seen pg's essays (either why to not not start a startup, how to make wealth, how to start a startup, whatever) and better yet jessica's book (founders at work) serve as a serious kick in the ass to people in cushy day jobs at ms and google; a few of my friends quit are now in this summer's yc program.<p>if pitching the idea isn't going well, i've found that giving potential team members problems to solve (""hey, how could this be made to scale to x members"" or ""what features should be put into the first version"" -- whatever, the specific problem isn't the point) gets people going (and as a bonus lets you see if they give smart answers) and 1) makes them feel a sense of ownership/participation in the project and 2) opens the door to nudges like ""yeah, these are the kinds of problems we'd be solving!"" i've found this kind of end-around persuasion is better than arguing or trying to tackle objections head on (people love to buy; they hate to be sold.)",1179472581
22993,comment,22970,22970,0,0,BrandonM,,,"The article phrases it in a way as if to indicate that Firefox has to choose between being slim and having good (meaning bug-free) plug-ins.  Why not have official Firefox-supported add-ons, distinguished from those made by users, which add functionality such as spell-checking and page-caching?  These add-ons could even be included in the default installation, with the ability to remove them if desired.<p>If they did this, the core of Firefox would be slim, with additional functionality provided by plug-ins, just like the original vision, and all the great functionality that has been added lately would not be sacrificed.",1179472349

22990,comment,22959,22961,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"As Aston pointed out, it looks a lot like yelp.  I can see you've tried to differentiate it with the ""food blog"" thing, and all...but I think those changes make it less interesting than yelp rather than merely differentiated.<p>Don't get me wrong, it looks really nice--nice design, cool features with the maps and all.  Looks like you've executed well, but with maybe a somewhat weak idea.  It can probably be flipped over into something cool.  You just need to figure out what...<p>And you will need more content, as another said.  Until someone comes to your site and gets value out of it, they won't feel compelled to pay it forward with a contribution of their own.",1179472067

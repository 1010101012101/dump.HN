If you're paying a hosting provider $500/mo for a sever that you generate an average of $1000/hr in web sales from and they have a 3 hour outage, you'll get an SLA credit for a couple of bucks applied to your next months service.<p>The Internet is filled with news about hosting provider provided backups being unusable for a number of reasons at inopportune times.<p>You should have a backup copy of your code/databases in your control, on a machine that is completely independent from whatever you are doing your production hosting on.  You should have done a ""warm metal"" install and test of that code another server to be sure that you can recover operations in a reasonable amount of time (whatever is appropriate for your case).<p>For your scale (based on your posts here, my assumption: Single developer, or developer with a couple of contractors; production site; 1-5K visits per month; non time-sensitive/mission-critical service.) you probably don't need high-availability auto-failover.  But, you SHOULD have your DNS hosted separate from your hosting provider, you SHOULD have low TTL's, you SHOULD have a backup server in a warm state at some other provider, and you SHOULD know how to at least do a basic DNS update to redirect traffic over to a backup site that either runs the service or puts up a basic, friendly ""OOPS, BRB"" page.<p>I've often thought of a startup that would basically human-automate these things for guys like you.  You still wouldn't be 100% self-sufficient, but you would be able to outsource SOME of your entire reliance on 1 provider.  You'd then have to have 2 tiers of total failure (your provider, and this service) to encounter complete down time.",1273506784

1334758,comment,1334187,1334525,0,0,btilly,,,"Your assumptions are unreasonable, insufficiently well specified, and are asking the wrong question.<p>If in a year out of a million hard drives only 5000 die, then you're projecting a 200 year average lifetime per disk drive.  No real disk has that.  A more reasonable 5 year average lifespan gives you 200,000 failures per year.  Which is much worse.<p>Next, you're asking about the odds of 2 failing on the same machine.  How many disks are on a machine?  1?  10?  100?  Are failures independent events?  It makes a huge difference.  In fact they are not independent because when the motherboard craps out you lose access to all disks on that machine at once.  At their scale it is too much work to figure out whether some of that data is recoverable - you just assume there is another copy somewhere and throw away the stale data.  If you're wrong, then oops.<p>You are also throwing out the 15 minute disk replacement time.  It may take 15 minutes to replace a disk, but that figure is irrelevant.  To replace a disk you have to locate the machine, and it has to matter enough to you to send a person out.  I guarantee you that the time before a person gets involved is going to average more than 15 minutes.  Generally a <i>lot</i> more than 15 minutes.  (Google famously takes the attitude that it is generally more work than it is worth to find the broken machine, and lets most dead machines sit there indefinitely.  I wouldn't be surprised if other cloud providers imitate this.)<p>Next you have to consider that the end user shouldn't care about machines.  For the purpose of redundancy Amazon is not going to keep multiple copies of the same data on the same machine.  They are going to put them in different machines, and hopefully in different places.  That will reduce the odds of a single failure losing your data.<p>All of that said I am somewhat shocked that Amazon would advertise a 0.5-0.1% rate of data loss as acceptable.  I don't know Google's actual failure rate, but I'd be willing to bet large amounts of money that it is much lower than that.<p>For instance search for ""gmail lost data"".  The only significant gmail data loss that turns up was in 2006.  (See <a href=""http://techcrunch.com/2006/12/28/gmail-disaster-reports-of-mass-email-deletions/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://techcrunch.com/2006/12/28/gmail-disaster-reports-of-m...</a> for more.)  A grand total of 60 accounts got wiped out.  Subsequently most of the lost data was restored from backup.  (I doubt that the error was at the data storage layer.)<p>That's not just better than what Amazon delivers.  That is ridiculously better.",1273506528

If you don't fry in transfats and are really gentle with the batter, instead of slathering it on, I actually don't see much reason to be concerned about deep-fat frying, under this theory of nutrition.<p>That said, I tend to just saute or steam. Deep-fat frying is a lot of work for dubious reward.<p>The rest, yes, assuming you mean full-sugar/full-HFCS soda.

1334749,comment,1334110,1334202,0,0,llimllib,,,"> Once upon a time there were four smart women named Louise Sivy, Helen Braun, Ethel Rew, and Patricia Troy who saw a need for an independent early childhood and elementary program offering small classes and a challenging multi-faceted curriculum. They had been colleagues at Wroxeter-on-the-Severn School and opened Chesapeake Academy in 1980, with just 36 students. They held classes at a space previously occupied, believe it or not, by a beauty parlor. The next year classes were held in a local church before moving to our present location in Arnold, MD just a few miles from Annapolis.<p>> The four smart women were resourceful. Moving from the beautiful castle-like school building at Wroxeter they found they were in need of basic furniture for classrooms and bartered for desks and chairs with local schools. They were conscious of fiscal needs and worked with generous families to administer the school’s financial resources.<p>> They wrote curriculum, taught classes and worked with their faculty to lay the groundwork for the individualized curriculum and the active learning philosophy Chesapeake Academy champions today. The four smart women were visionary. They embraced technology as an educational resource, while Apple® computer company was just finding its' way into the school marketplace.<p><a href=""http://www.chesapeakeacademy.com/podium/default.aspx?t=103674"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.chesapeakeacademy.com/podium/default.aspx?t=10367...</a><p>Patricia Troy is the mother of Dave Troy, a local entrepreneur, and she did exactly what you're proposing.",1273506422

People invest in the market in order make money: if they expect that there's a greater amount of money to be made they'll invest more; if the amount to be made is lower, they invest less. If people are trying to get into the market (i.e., they think more money is to be made), prices rise; if the opposite, prices go down.<p>So the movement of the market doesn't tell us that anything is ""good"" or ""bad"", it can only tell us if investors believe that it will lead to an increase or decrease of investment income.<p>In the case of the USA, it should be obvious that the government pumping billions of dollars into businesses (banks, GM, Chrysler, etc.) will lead to people invested in those business getting more income, so prices of those investments rises. That is despite the fact that this money is earned (after the final accounting) on the backs of taxpayers that <i>aren't</i> invested. Thus, the bailout is a transfer of wealth from the poor to the rich.<p>That said, the markets are hugely chaotic.

I recently killed my Facebook account out of frustration from seeing their social widget all over the place.  But the main reason I was using it was:
a) People who felt the easiest way to do event invitations was through facebook by way of a point and click here's all my friends in one place interface.
b) People sharing Photographs with groups of friends w/ discreet privacy interfaces.<p>The C) of this list is all my friends who aslo have twitter accounts who add #fb to the end of every.damn.tweet because that's some kind of special operator to ""update their profile message"".<p>The question I put forth is why not create a thin layer to pull together the services which provide these already?  Twitter already does short one line status updates.  Flickr has discreet friend-level privacy settings.  There are 8 billion easy to use invitation services.  There are other photo services which I'm not familiar with like Picassa which likely do the same.<p>Rather than reinvent the wheel - we should be pushing for some kind of OAuth or OpenID services to tie these things together CLEARLY.  Maybe a simple one-stop page to manage relationships with people, and your services.  Your ""profile"" page can simply be ""rit stores his photos at Flickr."" and a link to those (or show them inline).

Android, on the other hand, has built-in buttons for Back and Menu, and has a generally common theme of long-press for ""context-menu""-like action. This ends up making Apple-platform apps inconsistent, occasionally brilliant but frequently odd, while Android apps are pedestrian but consistently usable, in the sense that actions can easily be discovered and reasonably easily invoked, but not necessarily with a minimum of taps - usually there's at least one or two extra taps involved with Android apps.<p>I think the optimum would be somewhere in between. Android has too many buttons: the Search button is ironically mostly redundant. The consistency of a back button works really well. The utility of a menu button is debatable; it many ways, it's a cop-out.

There are a ton of non-technical cofounders out there, but it is rather difficult to find good developer/technical founder/engineer.<p>I should clarify that, finding a good developer isn't hard. Yet finding one that is available, willing to work for equity and interested in what you're doing is rather difficult.<p>Let's break those down:<p>- Available: Good developers have often been snapped up already. Its rather like dating, in that you generally have to find people between things. Top grade developers will probably already have something lined up before they quit another gig, making that gap effectively zero. You need to convince someone that you know is already on the way out that your startup will be better than whatever they are already doing.<p>-Cash/Equity: I see people talk all the time about the value of equity. Honestly, it generally isn't worth the paper it is written on from what I've seen. There is a huge chance that you'll work on it for a few months and little will come of it. Yes, you could start the next Google/Twitter/Facebook, but it is unlikely.<p>Equity does not pay the bills. You're talking about people in NYC here. They might have a 2K/month studio apartment in SoHo. You probably won't be doing much for founders salaries even on an angel round, so suddenly this looks to be a really long time without cash flow if you're talking equity only. For people in their 20's that haven't already been through a successfully exited startup and don't have a nest egg (or trust fund) this isn't possible.<p>They understand the value of risk and stock, but knowing the value of it and being able to realistically quit your job/graduate and work without a paycheck is really hard. If the value was there, then the investment capital would be there. The concept of value is there, but not the value.<p>- Selling the idea: At this stage, you're generally selling an idea of an idea. 95% of the time when people talk to me about some startup they are doing I'm thinking, ""This will never work"", ""I know 6 people doing the same thing and they are a year ahead of you"" or ""Where is the money?"".<p>Rare is it that someone has an idea like GroupOn that is an instant, 'duh' moment and you think you'd want to be instantly part of and owning a large portion of. I'm not going to work for a company (and take mainly equity) that I don't believe in.<p>All of this creates an impression of a bottleneck of developers and technical talent in a city. Throw in Google and a few other large companies (and academia) that can and will pay for top level talent and things really start looking dry.<p>But here's the thing, <i>I don't think there is a lack of technical talent</i>. Rather there is a lack of top level non-technical co-founders out there will killer ideas, vision, experience, connections and fund raising ability. What are they bringing to the table if not those things? While an early stage startup can run with technical talent only, it can run without a 'biz guy' just fine while things get off the ground.<p><b>So what to do as a non-technical co-founder?</b><p>- Get technical! A little over a year ago few hard programming skills. Then I started picking up Ruby stuff on the side. I'll never be a top level engineer, but through pain and blundering I can get the job done and get something mocked up in a reasonable amount of time to show that there's something more than just an idea. This also gives me the ability to make better decisions as a business person  and understand the rest of the company<p>- Get money! Paying people gets stuff done. If your ideas are so killer, you can surely raise 50K or so to get them done. I've had friends (in NY) raise 50K to start things that would never scale or go big like PR firms. They did this through networking and knowing the right people. Its a big city with a lot of money floating around. Find it and pay to get your base level prototype made. Developers will blow you off if you're waving your hands and talking about an idea, but if you say you'll pay $125/hr to have a prototype made, then they listen.<p>- Have better ideas and bring more to the table: There are a few non-technical people that I'd follow anywhere and its because they do have consistently great vision and ideas.  Show people that you can lead and followthrough. One of my good friends Tim Hwang can't code at all (AFAIK), but I've seen him execute with the Awesome Foundation, ROFLcon and the Web Ecology Project. I know that if he gets a great idea, that he will hold up his end. Do things like this and you'll have no problem finding developers and technical co-founders.",1273503922

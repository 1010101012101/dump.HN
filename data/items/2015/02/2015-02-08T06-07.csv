(And F# had generics in the compiler using an erasure system before that.) If those MSR folks had not risen to the occasion, C# prolly would have had to used a lame erasure approach just like Java.<p>DLR and LINQ don&#x27;t modify the runtime, nor does the TPL.<p>So there&#x27;s been some incremental improvement in GC, some advancements in JIT (perhaps driven by Windows Phone needing more AOT support). And this was stuff that was known for a long time, but MS stubbornly refused to do, just like they did with static linking for C#.<p>But come on, no real serious advancements since the CLR v2. The IL is still the same. MSR came in and gave them a vastly improved type system, and things have sat there ever since.<p>Maybe that&#x27;ll soon change, but seeing as how C#&#x27;s been just slowly adding F#&#x27;s features and toting their compiler rewrite for years, somehow I&#x27;m not really counting on any revolutionary language tech coming out of there.",1423378535

9016623,comment,9014770,9015276,0,0,crdoconnor,,,">One day we will return to the value of building quality products and value the people that do it as the engine rather than the financial part of the company as the engine. You can&#x27;t have financial success without happy workers and thus good products being produced. After globalization is more baked in, it won&#x27;t be as easy for companies not valuing quality work. We don&#x27;t want to finish that stage with a depleted consumer base.<p>This is certainly what drives real economic growth (as opposed to that phony stuff caused by ramping up consumer debt to heady levels).<p>However, I don&#x27;t think that the &quot;MBA short term metric builders&quot; (as you put it) are at all concerned with real growth. I think they would <i>far</i> rather see steady and slow stagnation of their companies and the economy as a whole where their position in the hierarchy is kept intact rather than fast growth where their position is more uncertain.<p>This is why I&#x27;m not so optimistic that valuing quality work is a state that the country will naturally return to driven by market forces. I think the decline will continue unabated until there is some kind of enormous keynesian kick from the government (in the past it was war and a federal public works program).",1423378334

It could easily be the difference between getting a raise and getting fired.<p>How is this relevant to the conversation? This isn&#x27;t a letter to his boss, it&#x27;s a blog post. Even so personality types differ vastly between individuals and your argument appears to be culturally conditioned in a different cultural. In other words, we live completely different worlds due to our cultural conditioning (or lack of - by that I mean our association with our inner voice).<p>> The first one is an absurd overarching dogma declaring every other app-building technology to be inferior to react with no backing whatsoever<p>It&#x27;s just a matter of using the word &#x27;a&#x27; vs. &#x27;the&#x27;. We actually get it wrong MOST of the time. Replacing &#x27;the&#x27; with &#x27;a&#x27; provides much more clarity. For example, you could say &#x27;Please bring me the green chair in the closet&#x27;, but if there&#x27;s more than one green chair? Well there&#x27;s more than one &#x27;right&#x27; way to build apps. React is &#x27;a&#x27; right way to build an app. There are MANY wrong ways to build apps, and most web frameworks (in my opinion) build apps a wrong way. React is one of the few. That&#x27;s how I feel.<p>I think you either have an ulterior motive for criticizing React itself (money, company), or you&#x27;re just closed minded.",1423378223

9016617,comment,9015085,9015085,0,0,kuujo,,,"The proposed optimizations are pretty interesting, but I think my favorite such optimization has been proposed by Ayende Rahien. As with the optimizations outlined in this paper, his is related to leader election.<p>One of the issues with leader election in Raft is the potential for split votes. Raft tries I guard against this by randomizing election timeouts in order to discourage two candidates from requesting votes at the same time. What Ayende suggests, though, is to add a pre-vote stage wherein followers poll other nodes to determine whether they can even win an election prior to actually transitioning to candidates and starting a new election. This ensures that only up-to-date followers ever become candidates and thus prevents nodes that will never win an election from ever transitioning to candidates in the first place.",1423378102

Provide mutual defense to Canada, the entire continent of Europe, and South Korea.<p>3. Defend counties like Japan and Iceland, which are treaty-bound not to have militaries of their own.<p>By tradition and policy, but not necessarily binding treaty or law, the US military also has the following missions:<p>4. Protect the entire Western Hemisphere from foreign aggression (the Monroe Doctrine).<p>5. Protect the economic supply chain of the developed world, particularly the oil supply.<p>6. Occasionally intervene, militarily, in humanitarian crises (this goes back and forth; yes in Somalia, no in Rwanda, yes in Yugoslavia).<p>7. Provide purely humanitarian assistance in case of natural disasters (the military has tons of logistical ability that&#x27;s occasionally repurposed to provide food and water to e.g. Haiti whenever it gets hit by a hurricane).<p>8. Keep the world&#x27;s sea lanes open for shipping (this is kind of a shared responsibility with every major naval power, but we&#x27;re practically the only one left).<p>Also, there are non-functional requirements to the US military, driven by purely political forces that almost no potential US enemy has:<p>9. Minimize friendly casualties. Spare no expense to accomplish this.<p>10. Minimize civilian casualties.<p>11. Maintain good PR so they don&#x27;t look like bullies.<p>In other words, the US has to bear the bulk of the entire world&#x27;s military requirements, and not just be able to <i>win</i> wars, but win them in absolute routs that are nearly unprecedented in world history. If anything, the US military is <i>undersized</i> for its current requirements. It&#x27;s oversized if you&#x27;re looking at requirement #1, but that&#x27;s a ridiculous understatement of the actual requirements, or any <i>realistic</i> set of requirements, for the US military.",1423375879

This is why so many services companies try to go into products because the customer services/money exchange is much easier and well understood with simple ownership, which is own it upon payment but not the maker, just the product.

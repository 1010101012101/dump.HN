All have their tradeoffs of what they uniquely provide vs give away. Very few projects will critically fail or succeed solely from the selection of a particular framework or language.<p>- I&#x27;m not sure if you&#x27;re connecting customers who don&#x27;t care what language their system is built in, causing 3 AM bugs.  If so:<p>a) 3 AM bugs are not a cause of any particular language of framework or language, or the customer not caring about which one, but rather, the developer.<p>b) Bugs are a reality on all platforms, and are best insulated against by a combination of process, policy and strategy that can be reasonably implemented in any stack.<p>Ultimately, it&#x27;s about how the user feels and the value that provided to them in solving a pain.<p>Customer value is NOT the same value the developer provides themselves to make the developer&#x27;s own life easier and somehow believing that all the build tools in the world will solve the customer&#x27;s problem any better, or make a difference for the end user.  It&#x27;s not as often as it seems.<p>Most languages and frameworks are capable of delivering delight if the developer spends time focussing on the user&#x27;s pain and not just their own pains in their stack.  Looking at how much value HN provides, it&#x27;s not a function of it&#x27;s language, framework, or coding.<p>Maybe like inter-faith, i&#x27;m an inter-platform kind of guy as a polyglot and see the good everyone can be doing instead of dividing among syntactical philosophy that is indistinguishable to the users in the end.",1387918370

Then, there was a young boy, looking about 8 years old and maybe 4&#x27; tall, in a military uniform. It was an adult in the North Korean military. Now, when countries get together like this, they send Soldiers who they feel will best represent them, so you have to consider the fact that this on-the-verge-of-death little kid was one of the best that the North Koreans had.<p>North Korean soldiers on the DMZ, which is the most important place, get about 800 calories a day.

6961056,comment,6960239,6960942,1,0,andrewflnr,,,"I strongly agree that functional/expression-based code is usually a nicer way of expressing algorithms. Composing functions like map and filter feels like a better way of processing collections than loops. Higher-order functions in general were a big revelation for me. Once I read about algebraic data types, they started showing up in my pseudo-code, even before I&#x27;d programmed with them. In general, declarative relationships, such as FP lets you write, tend to be easier to grok than procedures.<p>For the OP, let me see if this connects: In C/C++ and others, we have the ternary operator, which lets you write conditional expressions.\n  status = n > 9000 ? &quot;yes&quot; : &quot;no&quot;;\nThis is pretty convenient, but annoying to read afterwards, especially if you start nesting. Functional languages let you have the same convenience without the annoyance. You can do things like this OCaml:\n  status := if n > 9000 then&quot;yes&quot; else &quot;no&quot;\nYes, OCaml lets you have mutable state if you need it.<p>FWIW, the &quot;just functional&quot; language in my head is a lot closer to OCaml than Lisp. Haskell and Lisp both add a lot of &quot;extra&quot; stuff that&#x27;s cool but (obviously) not needed to be &quot;functional&quot;.

Functional data structures can use mutation behind the scenes to produce a facade of immutability. Clojure has an efficient &quot;immutable&quot; array data structure offering constant-time (~log32 n) performance and better space usage. Shallow binding is another general technique that produces space and time performance nearly identical to corresponding mutable data structures by wrapping the mutable data structure with older versions storing a pointer to the incrementally newer version plus the incremental change. Both of these use mutation behind the scenes. It&#x27;s not necessary to sacrifice performance to program in a functional way.",1387917639

6961047,comment,6960239,6960239,2,0,capcah,,,"tl;dr: State is bad for optimizations, FP encourages you to write most of the code state-free.<p>One of the perks of FP is that it exposes pure functions, functions that have a fixed output for a given input. Since it&#x27;s really bad at storing and mutating state(canonically can only be done via monads), it encourages you to separate your code into pure and mutable states. Let&#x27;s take, for instance, a function that reads a file and xor&#x27;s that with a random byte stream. A non functional approach would be something like this:<p><pre><code>  void xor_file_stream(file input, stream random_stream){\n    result = []\n    file_byte = read_byte(input)\n    while(file_byte != EOF){\n      stream_byte = read_byte(random_stream)\n      res.append(file_byte^stream_byte)\n      file_byte = read_byte(input)\n    }return result\n  }</code></pre>\nA possible way to write the same function using FP, using currying[1] and map[2](a fundamental construct in FP), one can write the code as this:<p><pre><code>  byte xor(byte b1, byte b2){\n    return byte(byte b2){\n      return b1^b2\n    }\n  }\n  //Here I assume the language has file and random_stream as iterables\n  void xor_file_stream(file input,stream random_stream){\n    return map(map(xor,random_stream),input)\n  }</code></pre>\nWhile, in a naive implementation, this would be much slower than the procedural implementation, there are much stronger assumptions one can make in respect to the functions while optimizing the compiler. First, the function xor is a pure function with 2^9 possible input values, and can be substituted by a precomputed lookup table, speeding up the map function. Since the function is guaranteed not to hold state, one can also unroll the map loops, or paralelize it if needed.<p>But remember that most &quot;pure&quot; FP languages are bad at keeping state, turning a huge game(for instance) into a challenge both to the programmer and to the compiler.<p>[1] - <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Currying\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Currying</a><p>[2] - <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Map_%28higher-order_function%29\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Map_%28higher-order_function%29</a><p>EDIT: Formmating, not used to posting to hackernews comments",1387917439

6961033,comment,6960239,6960239,5,0,lkrubner,,,"I don&#x27;t have an answer for you, but for the last year I have been learning Clojure, and I have found it fascinating. I do not think this will satisfy you, but I would like to share some of the things that I find interesting about Clojure.<p>Lately I&#x27;ve been studying the source code of Aleph, a web server written by Zach Tellman. Zach is a very smart guy, and reading his source code is an education (I&#x27;ve actually found this true of the majority of Clojure projects: the quality of the code is very good, and Clojure is the only language I&#x27;ve worked with so far where I have been able to learn so much reading the source code of the 3rd party libraries that I rely on).<p>Let&#x27;s start with an interesting comment about Java, on StackOverflow:<p>Why doesn&#x27;t more Java code use PipedInputStream / PipedOutputStream?<p><a href=\"http://stackoverflow.com/questions/484119/why-doesnt-more-java-code-use-pipedinputstream-pipedoutputstream\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://stackoverflow.com/questions/484119/why-doesnt-more-ja...</a><p>In response to that question, matt_b suggests this is part of the reason why people don&#x27;t use pipedinputstream or pipedoutputstream:<p>&quot;Typically, data is read from a PipedInputStream object by one thread and data is written to the corresponding PipedOutputStream by some other thread. Attempting to use both objects from a single thread is not recommended, as it may deadlock the thread.&quot;<p>So now, look at how PipedInputStream and PipedOutputStream are used in Aleph:<p><a href=\"https://github.com/ztellman/aleph/blob/perf/src/aleph/formats.clj\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://github.com/ztellman/aleph/blob/perf/src/aleph/format...</a><p>In particular, look at this function:<p>(defn channel->input-stream\n  &quot;Consumes messages from a channel that emits bytes, and feeds them into an InputStream.&quot;<p><pre><code>  ([ch]\n\n     (channel->input-stream ch &quot;utf-8&quot;))\n\n  ([ch charset]\n\n     (let [out (PipedOutputStream.)\n           in (PipedInputStream. out 16384)\n           bytes (map* #(bytes->byte-array % charset) ch)]\n\n       (future\n         (try\n           (loop []\n             (when-let [msg @(read-channel* bytes :on-drained nil)]\n               (.write out ^bytes msg)\n               (recur)))\n           (finally\n             (.close out))))\n              \n       in)))\n</code></pre>\nI think this is very clean. He uses (future) to put the PipedOutputStream on its own thread, meanwhile he returns a PipedInputStream to whoever is calling this function. This is a good use of PipedInputStream/PipedOutputStream, and he&#x27;s ensured they run in separate threads, which answers the concern that matt_b raised on StackOverflow.<p>On a different subject, I have learned a new style of programming by using closures in a functional language. Maybe I am a bit stupid, but it took me a long time before I began to realize how useful closures are. My only other exposure to closures was with Ruby and Javascript, but I never did concurrent programming with Ruby or Javascript, and it seems to me the greatest use of closures is when you are dealing with a lot of threads. When I first started writing Clojure code, I did not use closures at all. I wrote some clumsy code. For instance, I wrote a function that got some data from the database, and I wrote another function that stored that data in a hashmap in memory (using the memory as a cache) and I wrote another function that would check the hashmap for the data, before making the call to the database, and then I wrote another function that ran every 15 minutes and erased items in the hashmap, thus invalidating the cache. But then I realized I could combine several of these operations by creating a closure at the moment that I store data in the hashmap: the closure could call Thread.sleep(900000) and then delete the data from the hashmap. I found it convenient to create the closure while I was storing the data in the hashmap as, at that moment, I have all the information I need, including the key with which that data is being stored. Then I push the closure onto a queue and it gets processed in 15 minutes. This simplifies things quite a bit.<p>Again, Zach Tellman&#x27;s code has been educating me about how powerful closures can be in the context of concurrent programming. Look here:<p><a href=\"https://github.com/ztellman/aleph/blob/perf/src/aleph/http.clj\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://github.com/ztellman/aleph/blob/perf/src/aleph/http.c...</a><p>And look especially at this function:<p>(defn wrap-ring-handler\n  &quot;Takes a normal Ring handler, and turns it into a handler that can be consumed by Aleph&#x27;s\n   start-http-server.  If the Ring handler returns an async-promise, this will be handled properly\n   and sent along as a long-poll response whenever it is realized.\n   This should be the outermost middleware around your function.  To use an Aleph handler at a\n   particular endpoint within the scope of this middleware, use wrap-aleph-handler.&quot;<p><pre><code>  [f]\n\n  (fn [ch request]\n\n    (run-pipeline request\n      {:error-handler (fn [ex] (error ch ex))}\n\n      ;; call into handler\n      (fn [{:keys [body content-type character-encoding] :as request}]\n        (if (channel? body) \n\n          (if (options/channel-ring-requests? request)\n\n            ;; leave channels as is\n            (f (assoc request ::channel ch))\n\n            ;; move onto another thread, since there will be blocking reads\n            (task &quot;input-stream-reader&quot;\n              (f (assoc request\n                   ::channel ch\n                   :body (formats/channel->input-stream body character-encoding)))))\n\n          (f (assoc request\n               ::channel ch\n               :body (formats/bytes->input-stream body character-encoding)))))\n\n      ;; send response\n      (fn [response]\n        (when-not (::ignore response)\n          (enqueue ch response))))))\n</code></pre>\nHere you have a function that returns a function that returns another function. The first returned function calls (run-pipeline) and gives (run-pipeline) a closure that will be called later, but with data that we have right now, in this context.<p>You are asking why functional programming is a big deal. I&#x27;m sure different people will have different answers. I think the difficulty in answering is that there is no one thing that by itself makes an answer, rather, it is a whole series of things that combine in powerful ways. For me, the immutable data structures of Clojure are an education. I have learned a lot. I think using closures in the context of concurrent programming could be an absolute nightmare, if it was not for the safety offered by immutable data structures. And yet, I don&#x27;t think immutable data structures are a big deal by themselves, nor do I think that closures are a big deal by themselves, nor do I think concurrency is a big deal by itself. Only when I look at the combination of these 3 do I find myself enlightened, like I&#x27;ve just discovered a whole new level of programming, a level of power I have never felt in any other language.<p>A final note: Adam Bard has a blog post &quot;Effortless async by design&quot; in which he says &quot;I dare you to find a thread-safer language. Well, maybe Erlang.&quot; And then he also uses some code from Zach Tellman to demonstrate what he means. Bard&#x27;s post is worth a read:<p><a href=\"http://adambard.com/blog/why-clojure-part-2-async-magic/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://adambard.com/blog/why-clojure-part-2-async-magic/</a><p>I could list a lot of things that seem to me very powerful about the coding style I&#x27;ve learned this last year: composability, currying, closures, immutable data structures, thread-safe, etc. But I think descriptions like that tend to be a bunch of meaningless buzz words until you&#x27;ve dived in deep enough to see how they all interact with each other. Because its the interaction of these features that is really powerful, not any of them alone.",1387917158

It&#x27;s rather interesting, because before Scala I basically wanted C# on top of the JVM. And now C# is looking bland, bureaucratic, unproductive and I don&#x27;t want it anymore.<p>Of course, many people hoped that some language will end up replacing Java as THE language for the JVM. That never had any chance of happening, even if closures would&#x27;ve never make it in Java. The people that wanted more capable languages already moved on and the shops and software developers that continue using Java will not change languages, because if Java worked well for them, it will continue to work well in the future and everybody had plenty of opportunity for change already. Java will still be the main language used in the enterprise, simply because enterprise software development tends to favor cheaper, easier to replace developers. Of course, this is one reason for why startups tackling the enterprise space are thriving, but that&#x27;s another discussion.<p>Back to the point - we tend to think of languages and their evolution as some kind of football tournament. For me it&#x27;s rather uninteresting what language will &quot;win&quot;. I don&#x27;t really care. All I care about is for a language to have a sustainable and active community that churns out useful libraries. And some people fear that they won&#x27;t find jobs with language X. Personally I found the contrary to be true - finding well paying jobs for working on interesting projects in languages that are not Java, C#, C++ or PHP is much, much easier. Things are easier also from the employer side, because you&#x27;ve got less noise to deal with and usage of a certain language becomes one of the main attractions for that job. In my experience, it&#x27;s a win-win combination, which is why I fear the thought of my favorite languages becoming too mainstream.

6961005,comment,6959533,6959533,6,0,robomartin,,,"Thinking that this is about TDD or software management is to grotesquely miss reality.<p>This whole fiasco has demonstrated, to an incredible level of clarity, why we&#x27;ve reached a point where government is too big to work.  This has nothing whatsoever to do with who&#x27;s President or which party controls what.  This is a simple case of an entity that has grown so large, complex, ignorant and bureaucratic that it simply can&#x27;t figure out how to produce anything useful, from laws to websites.<p>The difference this time around is that this has been very public.  This is a problem that forces people to pay attention and get involved.  Healthcare affects everyone directly and people care about it.<p>Most of us who have understood the devolution of government over the years have recognized the incompetence of the organization as a whole for quite some time. Some have been more vocal than others in trying to highlight the issue.<p>It&#x27;s a difficult position to hold because it is relentlessly attack by those who, through indoctrination or religious-like following, stick to their respective parties and simply won&#x27;t even admit they are being screwed despite mounting evidence to the contrary.  The President lies about healthcare to the country and the world dozens of times and Liberal media contorts itself to try to figure out a way to spin it into some alternate reality that makes sense.  We had exactly the same kind of thing happen with Bush and his wars, but this is about the ACA.  We let them lie.  Some of us see it and call them on it while others shoot us down based on party loyalty and continue to support the effectively criminal behavior.<p>The difficulty in gaining mass awareness for these kinds of problems has been in that most people, at the end of the day, couldn&#x27;t care less about what&#x27;s going on inside the sausage-making factory.  They are too busy trying to earn a living and going through their daily lives.  There are things in most people&#x27;s lives that are far more interesting to them than what government does and how it works.  True to this I think it is fair to say that most US voters are utterly uninformed and get their opinions (and voting decisions) from the media --mostly TV.<p>Now things are different.  This is something that is important to everyone.  Health, food and housing are top-level concerns for everyone.  This ACA/Obamacare mess is achieving something no government critic could possibly buy for any amount of money:  Bring to the forefront the incompetence, waste and mismanagement that has become part and parcel of what our government has been about for years.<p>Everything in our government is done this way. Everything.  You just don&#x27;t see it or don&#x27;t care to dig into it for other issues.  Healthcare just made it first page news for everyone.<p>Everyone now sees how the sausages are being made.  There is no way to hide it.  Everyone can now balance the equation of what politicians said and promised them against what they&#x27;ve actually delivered.  A family who&#x27;s healthcare premiums doubled, who&#x27;s deductible skyrocketed and who lost the ability to see their doctors at their hospital has no way to satisfy a promise of lower premiums, better coverage and keeping what you like.<p>I still remember Los Angeles Mayor Villaraigosa deciding to change the outcome of a vote in a very public way right in front of the cameras while a woman came over to him and said &quot;Let them do what they are going to do&quot;, all of it picked-up by the microphones and cameras.  There is no shame or respect any more.  Politicians know they can get away with murder because there are no consequences for such things as publicly and visibly changing a vote or spewing out lies.<p>Hopefully people are starting to think about just how ridiculous it is to give a blank check or a pass to anyone in government.  I also hope they are starting to become more convinced that if we don&#x27;t make those who lie to us responsible for their lies we are never going to improve government.<p>If it had not been for Snowden who in government would have told us what was going on with the NSA?  They&#x27;ve been lying to us for years and they would have continued to do so had it not been for him.  They lied knowing there are no measurable consequences for their actions.  At worst they move elsewhere in government and live goes on.  It&#x27;s a joke.<p>Imagine if you were involved in a contract negotiation for you business, signing the papers for your home purchase, auto purchase or a lease rental agreement and the other party said something akin to &quot;Don&#x27;t worry.  We have to sign the contract to see what&#x27;s in it&quot;.  How fast would you run from that one?  You would, right?<p>Then, why is it that we let those in government play such games?  By extension they --the governing class-- over time, start feeling they can do anything, to anyone at any time.  I would not be surprised if this is the sort of thing that leads to mass surveillance programs not being given a second thought within that community.  If you can get away with murder you keep murdering, plain and simple.<p>The solution, I am afraid, is not technological, it&#x27;s political.  I&#x27;ve said this before: If you are in tech you need to be smart about politics because bad government and bad policy can be more destructive to your efforts than bad code.  The NSA fiasco alone will probably cost US companies billions.  Trust is a very difficult thing to regain, whether it is with your girlfriend, boyfriend, wife, husband, company or country.  Once trust is broken it takes orders of magnitude more work to regain it.  If ever.<p>So, there you are, becoming a highly skilled technologist thinking that government and political issues are of no importance to your mission, only to find out that your international trust and market potential keeps getting boned by ignorant fools in government who really have no clue what they are doing.  Government is almost the only entity that can completely destroy your startup with the stroke of an ignorant pen.  Look at the startups fighting against the transportation and housing unions, rules and regs.  How different would things be in terms of competition and progress if those barriers where not there?<p>Bottom line:  You have to be informed and get involved.  You have to fight against indoctrination to see what reality looks like.  Stop taking other&#x27;s opinions as your own.  Question everything, research, critically observe, measure and use your CS and mathematical skills to model.  In other words, be the high information citizen.<p>The devil isn&#x27;t in the details, it&#x27;s in politics.",1387916634

In a country like Italy, the amount of money is not large, so you can&#x27;t just play hardball with them, because they&#x27;ll just take their ball and go elsewhere, and <i>you</i> will be left high and dry.  If a few multinationals do it, Italy may very well have to run and appease a number of other companies to keep their revenue in Italy.<p>These are just some of the simple reasons.  The short answer is: If you do this, you may as well just hand them your government (or prepare for long term economic hardship).",1387915988

I suspect it is for many people.<p>Some mathematics provides some perspective. This is just an average example:<p>There are 8,760 hours in a year. (365 days x 24 hours)<p>We generally sleep 2,920 hours per year. (365 days x 8 hours)<p>8,760 - 2,920 is 5,840 hours that we are awake per year.<p>There are 2,080 working hours in a year. (52 weeks x 40 hours per week)<p>If you take 15 days off per year, that is 1,960 working hours per year. (2,080 - (15 days x 8 hours))<p>This means that, if you work for someone, approximately 34% (1,960 / 5,840) of your waking life is not self-directed; that time belongs to someone else, because you need to trade that time for money.<p>Perhaps like you, I am working to tip that percentage to my favor.

Practicing code reading also improves debugging skills as you have to use the same skills to understand the what and the why of perfectly working but unfamiliar code.<p>Whenever anyone asks me what they should do to improve their programming, I usually suggest reading more source code.

It would seem that significant portion of the tech community can&#x27;t seem to distinguish between the ideas that (a) the norm for recorded music should be that we pay for owning a copy of the recording and (b) we should take an aggressive approach to fighting piracy.<p>But let&#x27;s talk about radio broadcasting and tape recorders, because that might actually be an example of where we reached a reasonable equilibrium on this. It was understood that people did use them to get copies of recordings they didn&#x27;t buy, but everybody learned to live with that, and the norm remained that to legitimately obtain a recording, you bought it.<p>Software&#x27;s like that too. Nobody&#x27;s suggested the time for charging for software of any kind is over, that the end of software development is a service not a product. Some people choose to emphasize services (which is fine), some people choose the product route. Some people do both.<p>Many who choose the product route do try for some defense against piracy -- it&#x27;s the lock on the door of your house that you know can be broken with enough effort, but is still a good idea. Everybody knows there&#x27;s still some piracy anyway, but the norm stays that software publishers can claim the right to have their stuff purchased.<p>That&#x27;s what I think we should be going towards for a healthy music industry.",1387915389

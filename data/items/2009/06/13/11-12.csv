Without ads some other structure would arise. It might change a bit but the internet is here to stay.<p><i>""I hate people who hate advertising :/ It's irrational.""</i><p>I don't see anything irrational about disliking insidious, manipulative marketing messages being shoved in your face whereever you look. In fact I find it completely rational, what are you talking about? I am guessing that you rely on advertising for your income, but surely you can see the other perspective.<p>And saying that you ""hate"" people who hate advertising is pretty disturbing.<p>update: corrected misquote",1244894209

The research you need to do to write a good book may be illegal, however.  You can always do that in a different country, though.<p><i>And there's certainly no absolute right to anonymous speech....</i><p>The courts disagree.  See, <a href=""http://www.eff.org/cases/doe-v-cahill"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.eff.org/cases/doe-v-cahill</a> for example.

It thus exemplifies the purpose behind the Bill of Rights, and of the First Amendment in particular: to protect unpopular individuals from retaliation -- and their ideas from suppression -- at the hand of an intolerant society.""",1244894085

This is the 2nd time I am so appalled by their behavior, and one of the few times I am ashamed of the internet's privacy and the power of its denizens to do evil.<p>The last time (<a href=""http://bit.ly/qcWDC"" rel=""nofollow"">http://bit.ly/qcWDC</a>) was when 4Chan attacked an epilepsy forum frequented by people susceptible to photosensitive seizures, causing a dozen epilepsy attacks by uploading rapidly-moving images and flashing colors to the forum, triggering a dozen attack.<p>Willfully bringing about seizures in handicapped people and exposing children as young as 6 years old to wholly-explicit films of adult sex are E.V.I.L. .... and more importantly, punishable by law.<p>I hope someone wises up in the legal community and takes action against this site. Like I said, I know this is the sort of self-righteous anger that 4Chan is looking forward to receiving after these attacks, but there's a line and they crossed it a <i>long</i> time ago.<p>So, do tell, where's the funny side in this?",1244893435

656060,comment,655487,655487,0,0,pmjordan,,,"Living in a small European country, you run into similar problems. Being in the EU helps with physical goods (except new mobile phones until the unlocked versions make their way to the retail channels), but online services are pretty happy to ignore the fact that you even exist.<p>It gets even worse with media: each country has its own cartel representing entertainment copyright holders, meaning it's essentially impossible that we'll ever get something like hulu.com in Austria unless something changes in a big way. Presumably the legal hassles of working out contracts for each country individually are ridiculous, and simply not worth it in less populous countries. As with almost every aspect of the entertainment media industry, <i>everyone</i> loses: consumers, copyright holders and operator of the service.",1244893356

An alternate idea for tailrecursion.com: how about creating a service which would provide 'unlimited' tail keywords.  - the 'unlimited' part is just for the pitch to go with recursion.<p>This is of great interest/need to marketers and does involve recursion in a way that you use a seed to generate few keywords and then in turn use them to generate more. People would pay for it.",1244893120

And in that case, it's far more likely sites will just come up with better moderation tools to detect questionable content.<p>Online advertising is crucial for the survival of the internet. I kinda like the fact most sites are free to visit. You can hate it all you like, but without it, most of the internet wouldn't exist. I hate people who hate advertising :/ It's irrational. It's like saying you hate 'money', 'commerce' or even 'information'",1244891414

Companies don't care what they're hosting, as long as they are getting rich.  If they could legally make millions of dollars a year hosting child porn, they would.  (They have no objection to polluting the environment or forcing workers to work in unsafe conditions, directly resulting in many deaths every day.  Showing videos on the Internet is child's play compared to that.)<p>However, it's the advertisers who will get upset, and then pull out.  ""Our product associated with porn being shown to children?  Bye.""  With no advertising revenue, the web (as we know it) cannot exist.  That means either censorship (too hard; ""information wants to be free""), or actually paying money for content.<p>FWIW, this is not unheard of.  The big Japanese video sharing site, NicoNico Douga, requires everyone to pay.  Even though it's not free, it's more popular than Youtube.<p>In the end, the advertisers lose, and I think that's a good thing.  I hate advertising.<p><i>Media corporations have already started demanding more control over the ""distribution channel"" that is the Internet.</i><p>They're demanding, but nobody cares about their demands.  I know people whine about Hulu's restrictions, but I've never even visited Hulu and I still get all my TV online.  It's called Usenet.  You open your news reader, browse to alt.binaries.multimedia.tv-shows, or whatever, and download away.  In 10 minutes, I have whatever show I want, in HD, with no restrictions.  ""Censorship is considered damage, and the Internet routes around it.""<p>The whole ""let's punish file-sharers"" thing has also backfired.  Even governments with very weak personal protections (France, the UK) have struck down the disconnection laws.  The Pirate Party has 17% of the vote in Sweeden (and large numbers in other EU countries, I think).  Organizations in the US are suing the RIAA for its lawsuit intimidation campaign.<p>The tide is shifting, and it's not towards the media industry's interests.<p>Basically, now is not time for the media companies to demand anything.  Nobody cares what they think.  If creating content isn't profitable anymore, they should go into some other business and stop bothering everyone else.",1244891095

The marketing was way too much, but I figured it should be a decent game. Well, it is, its something of a milquetoast Halo-clone shooter with some tacked on multiplayer/MMO stuff, but, my god, the game is drenched in Hollywood-esque overly-done orchestral music, big dramatic overtures, epic-style storytelling, etc. Its a lot of art and music that really doesn&#x27;t need to be there. Setting the scene shouldn&#x27;t be this big of a job, nor as serious.  Its just a game- Let me play it.<p>I doubt AAA games will ever go back to not being movie-like, but it just seems like a huge waste of money and time (yet another 10 minute intro to sit through for example).  A part of me would just rather dive into a simpler game that gets me to the gaming parts quickly instead of hitting me over the head telling me how awesome the game will be via cutscenes and dramatic scores.<p>Simplicity can be its own reward and can be just as emotionally fulfilling, as many low budget and simple-graphic indie games have shown. When Destiny is almost forgotten, we won&#x27;t be reminiscing about its cutscenes or whatever currently popular actors they got to do the voice-overs. We&#x27;ll be talking about our battles and accomplishments.  Shame the focus on these games is more towards the aesthetic than the actual gameplay.<p>Notch as our collective gaming conscience is kinda nice. I think someone who has a high profile should be saying these things. A lot of lower profile indie guys certainly have, but they don&#x27;t have the gaming cred to make the front page of HN, reddit, etc.",1410533790

We really think Rust is something special, and we hope you do too.<p>The guide starts with a traditional &quot;Hello, World!&quot; program. Next a quick detour to introduce &quot;Cargo&quot;, a tool for managing and building Rust programs and libraries. Then it&#x27;s back to the language.&quot;<p>If the guide actually builds something, the last sentence there could say &quot;Then it&#x27;s back to the language, starting with the basics and working up to <thing that is built>.&quot;",1410533128

8308239,comment,8303683,8305465,1,0,geebee,,,"My understanding is that Nadal didn&#x27;t really switch to being left handed.  When he was a child (was it age 8?), he had two handed strokes off both sides, which is common for kids.  Young tennis players often drop the non-dominant hand on the forehand when they get stronger.  His uncle, noticing that he was as strong off the left as the right, encouraged him to play as a lefty.  He perfected this over countless hours for the next 11 years, winning the french open at age 19.   This is vastly different from taking a seasoned pro and suddenly telling him to play with complete different tactics with his non-dominant hand!  In fact, if Nadal were required to play with Federer&#x27;s strokes tomorrow (ie., use his right hand, and hit a one handed backhand), my guess is that he&#x27;d get bageled in his next pro match, and I doubt he&#x27;d ever be in the top 100 again (that&#x27;s an extremely conservative estimate, there&#x27;s a good chance he&#x27;d permanently collapse in the rankings).<p>That said, I do think that Nadal is an excellent example of how to be adaptable.  Take a look some time at how he approached hard courts after his initial success on clay.  Rather than staying way back, he moved much closer in on the court, taking the ball on the rise, and taking his opponent&#x27;s time away.  It was a big adjustment for the former clay court specialist, but it worked, and it&#x27;s why Nadal is now one of the few players with a career slam, and titles on every surface.<p>So yes, you need to adapt, but (and I know I&#x27;m stretching a sports analogy a big far here) it demonstrates how the truly top players go about change.  They do adapt, but they&#x27;re highly strategic about it, they leverage existing strengths, and they don&#x27;t do it on a whim (and they especially don&#x27;t do it on someone else&#x27;s whim).<p>I actually think that technical leaders are also very organizationally savvy people.  They adapt and learn new things, but they don&#x27;t get jerked around from task to task - and they&#x27;ll say no and fight strategically about it if need be.  They understand how to align their projects with their strengths, and what they want to learn next.  This way, they don&#x27;t waste time or mental energy, and they play from a position of strength.",1410532823

In the case where the least fit one is killed off, there are n-1 species still in the mix with their relationships intact. You can of course extend it to keeping more than one of the fittest, or killing more than one of the least fit.<p>I was just re-reading that section of the book to try to give you a better answer and I think I must have mis-remembered his original experiment a bit (sorry about that). The original evolution model that failed to exhibit the behavior was more complex than just a survival of the fittest (he was playing with mutations and connections between species in a kind of complicated way). The part about killing off the least-fit species really was the key to getting complex behavior though, so at least that part of my original comment was right.<p>The eventual solution was to simplify the model so that the least-fit single species would go extinct and be replaced by a new randomly generated one each round. The fitness of a species was related to its connections, so if one species was to go extinct it could trigger others to cross the fitness threshold and go extinct as well. This led to cascades of extinctions with a power law distribution (like the pattern observed in real extinctions on Earth). The mass extinctions would eventually stabilize at a point where all species were above the fitness threshold, but the &quot;gene pool&quot; had been seeded with lots of new randomly generated species at that time, so there were periods of rapid mutation punctuating long stable periods where not much changed.<p>His book is pretty interesting, although it&#x27;s sometimes a little over the top with self-congratulation. I&#x27;m reading another one now called &quot;Self-Organized Criticality&quot;[1] which is a much more rigorous treatment of the idea that I think will be a bit less sensational and more applicable to real problems.

Feel free to ask if there&#x27;s something that could be double-checked for.<p>- The suing party is a german group whose officially recognized reason for existence is to protect customer rights.<p>- If Google doesn&#x27;t fix this, up to 250k€ per instance of violation (sadly not clarified what instance means), or jail up to 6 months (sic) or jail up to 6 months. (Unclear how that is supposed to be done.)<p>- Google has to pay 200€ + 5% interest, starting on 13.12.2013. (I don&#x27;t know over which timeframe this interest accrues.)<p>- Google has to pay all process costs, as it&#x27;s the losing party.<p>- Google offers services which it runs as a business, either by reserving the right to use customer data in a business manner (hangouts, docs, calendar) or by advertising (search, do note that TV broadcasting for example is a business with customers too).<p>- Google is required to make it possible to reach individual personal contact with a human employee at Google.<p>- The court recognizes and has discussed with Google that the problems of scale here are very real, but still insists on the fact that the current solution is not acceptable.<p>- The court even offers suggestions, such as providing multiple email adresses in the impressum to aid in channeling.<p>- Crucial to the court is that pointing at an online form is not enough, especially since the pointing is done at a maze of help pages which may, or may not, lead to an online form.<p>- The court recognizes that the law does not specify how the company has to communicate once person-to-person communication is established.<p>- The court recognizes that &quot;not answering&quot; is also a valid reaction, if and when a human employee has read/heard the request; BUT ONLY IF that kind of answer is not the rule.<p>- The court recognizes that efficient communication is not done by answering quickly, but by answering in a reasonable time frame and with detail according to the reasonable expectations of a user. (Thus implying that users may have unreasonable expectations which need not be fulfilled.)<p>- The court also recognizes that not all emails need to be read. The problem is that none are read. Google may filter and channel emails as it likes, as long as the system&#x27;s goal is explicitly to enable communication via email; not as it currently is, to deny communication.",1410530768

The Haskell definition encodes a special case, where the underlying &quot;category&quot; is &quot;Hask&quot;, whose objects are Haskell types and morphisms are Haskell terms. Of course this is strictly speaking not a category, but it is close enough.<p>In mathematics monads usually arise as adjunctions between two functors, for example beginning with a set of elements, you can consider the free monoid generated by it and forget the group structure, this gives you a much larger set. If you did this operation on a set of characters, you would get the set of all strings of those characters, eta would in this case be the operation that given a character in the character set gives you the corresponding string of length one and mu would concatenate two strings.",1410530757

Sun's lawsuit with Microsoft established that.<p>Google is hypocritical, but they haven't even come close to the ""evil"" of Microsoft in the glory days of ""The Evil Empire."" Microsoft used to have secret monopoly agreements with people. Google are openly disclosing their agreements and taking the flak.<p>Apple isn't a monopoly unless your definition of monopoly is ""Controlling their own platform."" Do they monopolize the Internet? No. Do they monopolize the market for phones? No. For phones that can access the Internet? No. Apple doesn't hold a monopoly and definitely hasn't done anything to abuse their so-called monopoly.<p>For example, MSFT shipped IE for free and killed Netscape. Apple shipped iTunes for free on the Mac and killed... Who exactly? Not even the celebrated Panic was killed as a company, just one product for a niche computer. Now Apple won't allow Flash on the iPad. Let me know when Adobe closes its doors.<p>Finally, the word ""underdog"" is not synonymous with the phrase ""also-ran."" Does anyone really think the bully that has gotten fat and can no longer beat up the new kid in the neighbourhood is now an underdog?",1281873240

The net result has been positive, but it's not without its problems.<p>As a results, there is still a lot of pressure from conservatives to take more repressive measures, and the road to full legalization is blocked by the relations with other countries (not just immediate neighbors, but the entire EU with its wide-open borders and the US that meddles in everyone's business) that take a much less liberal view.<p>Bottom line is: legalization will create new problems, some of them may be hard to predict. It does not magically solve the problem. It just allows you to focus efforts and resources on the <i>real</i> problems, instead of the side-effects of prohibition.",1281870104

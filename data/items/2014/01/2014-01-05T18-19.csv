(e.g. when you view a profile on twitter it has picture, first name last name, @username). Maybe they were able to check the first/last name and not just the username.",1388947327

There are tens of millions of businesses accepting credit cards. PayPal has 230 million active accounts. First Data has 6.2 million merchants.

7016730,comment,7015786,7016654,1,0,tesseractive,,,"There are no boys who grow up worrying that only girls go into tech and that it&#x27;s not for them. Female role models are not problematic for boys because everyone knows that men will be welcome. This situation is not symmetric across gender.<p>Are there girls whose role models are male and are fine with that? Of course. But it is difficult to determine how big a role the lack of more female role models may play in discouraging other girls who never go into the field, and the idea that more same-gender rule models may be beneficial is, at the very least, a reasonable hypothesis.",1388945715

At the size scale required, regular robots are way too clunky.",1388945308

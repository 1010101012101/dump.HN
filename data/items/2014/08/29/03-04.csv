I went to get some belongings out of the car (I foolishly left my wallet in the car when it was stolen, so I had no cash or credit cards to free the car at that moment), and was accused of stealing my own car by the tow yard employee (as if that somehow makes sense).

Its everything-at-once approach also made it harder to reference topics afterwards. The changes in this edition like they&#x27;ll be pretty helpful. It&#x27;s also cool that he&#x27;ll be using a default Cloud9 environment so people don&#x27;t need to worry about installing anything.<p>However, I still think there&#x27;s space for a fully modular approach to learning Rails instead of covering so many topics at once. For example, users could first learn how to use Active Record to interact with data on its own, and only later learn the other steps to building an app. This would also make it easy to look up topics later or just jump into the parts you&#x27;re interested in. It would also be cool if users were given tasks with pre-written tests (but without solutions) so they would need to figure out the solution on their own and immediately see if they got it right.<p>(I even thought of creating a small Rails tutorial on <a href=""http://www.learneroo.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.learneroo.com</a> but I can&#x27;t currently run Rails on it.

Compare the expense, labor, and expertise required to shoot and chop 35mm versus shooting digital on a DSLR and editing on your laptop!  Costs have undeniably gone down for all films, but more so for indies. These costs are a higher percentage of an indie film&#x27;s total cost than they are for a AAA title, which must pay significantly more for special effects, AAA actors, AAA directors, etc..<p>Theater ticket prices continue to go up regardless of the type of film.  Indie flicks also cost no less than AAA titles in home video.  Traditionally, low-cost inferior alternatives compete against the more expensive well-established products on the basis of price.

Here we see an example of a sensational headline followed by a topical article.<p>For a couple of years in college, I worked as a senior reporter at a newspaper, wrote hundreds of published articles, and never wrote a headline: Copy editors write headlines. Besides writing the headline and correcting spelling and grammar, editors also rearrange paragraphs, delete stuff, re-write whatever suits them, decide what page the article will appear on (front page...buried on the fiftieth page) and decide whether or not to print the story at all. Headlines themselves are written in a domain-specific language called &quot;Headlinese.&quot; The American Copy Editors Society has an annual &quot;Headline Contest&quot;: <a href=""http://www.copydesk.org/programs/contests/headlines/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.copydesk.org/programs/contests/headlines/</a><p>WRT the headline&#x27;s boast of using math as a &quot;secret weapon against wall st,&quot; the article said &quot;Frenkel blames the global economic crisis of 2008-09 on inadequate mathematical models used by bankers and traders to predict the financial markets...&quot; My reading of this is that if people weren&#x27;t so math illiterate, they could have seen the crash coming and perhaps taken steps to protect themselves.<p>Hmm. As both a mathematician and a former vp at a wall st bank, I have a different POV on the 2008 financial crash: Massive premeditated fraud on savers and retirees perpetrated by a handful of TBTF banks, enabled by lax government regulation and an &quot;easy money&quot; policy by the Fed. I didn&#x27;t need my math skills to see this crash coming four years in advance, and my math skills didn&#x27;t give me any &quot;secret weapons&quot; to stop it or defend myself--it was kinda like being caught in a tidal wave, except this was a tidal wave of greed and corruption.<p>Journalists say, &quot;A picture is worth a thousand words.&quot; William Schiesser said: &quot;An equation is worth a thousand pictures.&quot; I wish there were more equations and more coverage of STEM in the popular press. It would be great if journalists proved their conclusions logically, step by step, from their premises.<p>But the sad truth is that <i>journalism is nothing but a form of entertainment</i>.

You can&#x27;t make any stronger statements for what you want to do than the above lines I quoted. The FUD will always be there with this sort of decision.<p>Also, don&#x27;t take any advice on if it will work or not. Nobody has the experience you do working this niche. Even if they are doing something similar, your situation is unique, and you will find other angles you can hit this from to make it grow. With your time time attention on this, you might also find other things you can experiment with when your niche is out of season.<p>All the things you mentioned that you would like to do will give you great experience also.

If anything, I like configuration files expressed as scripts in whatever language the program is written in, since they&#x27;re very flexible (if I want 100 almost-identical entries for whatever reason, I can say so in the file rather than writing a separate generator), and while programming languages are complicated, people tend to already know them; but that does tie you to a specific language.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.yaml.org/spec/1.2/spec.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.yaml.org/spec/1.2/spec.html</a>",1393743745

7328065,comment,7327542,7327953,1,0,WildUtah,,,"a: Even with rectangular pizzas sold by weight, the larger one is a better value than the small. Consider that the border of the pizza is a 2-3cm wide crust that will probably go to waste because eating that much white bread is awful. In any case, it lacks delicious cheese, sauce, and black olives or pepperoni.<p>The larger the pizza, the smaller the ratio of fixed width perimeter to center. If the area of the perimeter were to maintain a constant ratio to the total area, it&#x27;s width would have to increase in proportion. That applies to any 2D shape, not just a circle or square.<p>In fact, the calculation in op is wrong because a 16&quot; pizza isn&#x27;t merely four times as large as an 8&quot; pizza. The 1&quot; crust makes the 16&quot; really a 14&quot; while the 8&quot; is really a 6&quot;. 14^2/6^2 = 5.44 times as large.<p>b: If you were to say anything like that in the USA, you&#x27;d be reported to the TSA for un-American activities as soon as anyone heard you. And the NSA would hear you, even if you said it inside your own head. So bring a 100ml or smaller bottle of lube with you for the probe next time you fly.",1393743714

You will be overwhelmed by support requirements to the extent that all development stops.<p>3. You will be overwhelmed by support requirements to the extent that much support never gets addressed.<p>4.

Then you have none of these problems, other than it's very difficult to navigate through the code as nothing is separated by functional area, and you have to recompile the whole program for every small change.<p>Next in the complexity chain, you could break apart the single C file into multiple .c files and include them in the right order, and not use header files at all.  However, that still requires that you recompile the whole program for every change.<p>So now we're down to compiling every separate .h/.c entity as its own object file to speed up compilation, but structuring these files so that they compile and include everything in the correct order becomes a much bigger problem.",1289396564

You have to hand it to Zed Shaw sometimes...<p>Now, seriously tho, this has been waiting to happen since forever. I always knew that when the right people started messing around with Lua, awesomeness would emerge.<p>Lua is the closest scripting language to C. It's faster than Python, Perl and Ruby[1]. It's not just faster, but also uses less memory. It's also extremely elegant (in language concepts[2], at least -- not too much of a fan of its syntax but whatever). But the fact is, apps running in Lua would be hard to beat in terms of single-node performance. Your $20 cloud box that struggles to keep hefty Ruby processes running (or even Python processes, though these are way smaller than Ruby processes) will suddenly be able to handle a lot more than it does today.<p>I think Lua for instance would make a lot of sense for the big ones: Google, Facebook, Twitter. Google has a lot of C++ code on its infrastructure[3]. Facebook resorted to C++, Java, Python, and Erlang[4]. Twitter took the Java path with Scala.<p>The more I build applications (and keep them running), the more I respect the Unix nature and the more I want to become proficient in C. Mastering a scripting language and knowing how to glue it to raw C, or something close to C, gives you a lot of power.<p>Imagine a Python+Lua stack, where you can have handlers written in Python and use small, specific Lua-based extensions to run complex computations. I'm already contemplating using something like Lunatic-Python[5] to accomplish that in an app where I have to create similarity-based clusters. Today the Python code that handles it takes about 15 minutes to run as a queued, background task. I'm very curious to see if I can bring that down with Lua-based code controlled by Python...<p>[1] <a href=""http://shootout.alioth.debian.org/u32/which-language-is-best.php"" rel=""nofollow"">http://shootout.alioth.debian.org/u32/which-language-is-best...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.lua.org/history.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.lua.org/history.html</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://www.quora.com/Ben-Maurer/Google-Infrastructure/answers"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.quora.com/Ben-Maurer/Google-Infrastructure/answer...</a><p>[4] <a href=""http://www.makeuseof.com/tag/facebook-work-nuts-bolts-technology-explained/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.makeuseof.com/tag/facebook-work-nuts-bolts-techno...</a><p>[5] <a href=""https://github.com/dmcooke/Lunatic-Python/blob/master/docs/lunatic-python.rst"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/dmcooke/Lunatic-Python/blob/master/docs/l...</a>",1289395128

Clojure code uses macros, but most of the time it's to tie stuff together into a prettier, more convenient interface--sometimes to remove repetitive code of course.<p>So, why not use macros all the time? Not because they're hard to understand--you can always expand them to see what they do (or ask the original author to document it), but because they are hard to compose, and reuse. Sure, they can be used in special case a, b and c, but give me a higher order operators, and suddenly I can compose an opus.",1289395043

Here's my offering with just concept.<p>The first thing they teach you in projectile motion in grade 12 physics is that the horizontal component is independent from vertical component. That means, if you ignore friction, and you throw a ball in an arc, you'll find that the horizontal speed is linear! This surprises many people, since it's not very intuitive. You would expect the horizontal speed to be quadratic or non-linear, which is not the case.\nIf the ball loses 40% of its <i>vertical</i> energy, it means that it'll just keep bouncing, but at lower and lower heights, but the horizontal speed is continuous. In fact, if given the initial velocity and angle, you could calculate the horizontal distance traveled by the ball for any point in time.",1289394574

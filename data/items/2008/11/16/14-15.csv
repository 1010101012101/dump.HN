The only issue is Flash on web sites.  Most of that is just ads so I don't miss it but the few videos I'd like to watch I can download and view them offline.<p>It's no different than running a Linux desktop and you are running the same software.

There are two glaring red flags in this scenario that were completely lost on the author: 1) The coincidence of someone finding the necklace and another person phoning in about it while the first guy was still in the store, and 2) the first guy asking for cash.<p>In my experience, coincidence--or any kind of anomaly, really--and strangers asking for money individually should be enough to arouse suspicion. Together they're a dead giveaway.",1226846194

The worse part is to get the users of the competitor's service switch to mine. Coz the competitor has a huge chunk of data that's of value to the user. How do i urge the users to switch when the competitor doesn't have an API to access the user's data? If he had it then i could've built an app to import user data from the competitor's service.",1226845972

365999,comment,365452,365452,0,0,swombat,,,"Are there virtues to irrationality too? It would be better to balance this article with one that presents the 12 virtues of irrationality...<p>To get started on this list:<p>1) Goodness - sometimes the rational choice is not the right choice.<p>2) Rapidity of execution - it can take hours or even a lifetime to come to a rational decision on some complicated, vaguely defined subjects (such as ethics). The irrational decision engine in your brain can make that decision in a split-second and be right most of the time.<p>3) Better resilience to incorrect or incomplete data - sometimes, you have incorrect or incomplete data, and no way to correct or complete it. Based on your rational analysis, you may decide to, for instance, refuse to meet someone. And yet, once you actually meet them, you may gather new information that changes your previous rational choice.<p>There's no doubt many more...",1226845641

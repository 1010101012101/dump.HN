1681005,comment,1680949,1680949,0,0,po,,,"<i>Part of the predicate for forks being so disruptive was the idea that there is One True Version — a creation, like a piece of software, a written work, or anything else, that can only be accurately represented by a single ideal expression.</i><p>Besides differing ideologies, I think part of the reason that forking was socially stigmatized was that splitting the community often meant that a project went from critical mass to two projects that were both sub-critical. It forced developers to choose one or the other.<p>Git is also very strong with the other half of the forking process: the merge. Forked projects like Firefox rarely merged back. I feel like this is an important point that was missed by the article.",1284181020
1681004,comment,1680535,1680535,0,0,skowmunk,,,"I having been working with a contractor for a while who does  website development for me. He is based in India. On one of our discussions he said he makes around Rs. 18 - 20 lakhs per year. That would equate to about $40,000 per year. It took him around 2 - 3 years to reach that position and he was a school teacher before that. I am sure, his intelligence, hardwork and professionalism played a good part in his growth. Now, almost all his revenues come from Odesk and Elance from customers outside India, though he started off on small projects in India.<p>I am assuming you have completed your undergrad in CS or a related field. You should be able to grow faster if you give it a serious try. It can also allow you to add practical skills while getting paid and when you are waiting for your big idea to come up.<p>Good luck.",1284180977

The only other route is a web-app.\nYou will still have to get Apples seal of approval to get on the AppStore. There is no alternative.\nYou will still have to adhere to the HIG (and more) to get Apples seal of approval. So no generic cross-platform apps, your app will have to behave like a proper iOS app in every way.<p>I think that in reality nothing has actually changed. The reason behind the original ban of 3d party cross-platform frameworks has not changed. It's just the way in which Apple defends against this risk that has changed.",1284180414

1680982,comment,1680067,1680067,0,0,brass_cannon,,,"For someone new to the payments industry such as yourself, I can't stress enough the following points:<p>-Get with a provider who has a good reputation for honesty, and won't aggressively sell you on deceptive rates. More often than not, the rates you're looking at when talking to a sales rep are not the rates you'll actually be charged. Discount rates, Misuse of Auth fees, NABU fees, APF fees, etc. are all easy for a provider to mask and confuse new merchants with.<p>-Get with a provider who has a reputation for excellent support. You'll have questions, to be sure. Collecting money from your customers is the most important part of your <i>business</i>; Make no doubt about it.<p>-Get with a provider who has a good strategy for dealing with PCI compliance. If you're storing cards in your database, or even just passing secure data through your server, PCI can be a very significant burden.<p>-Get with a provider who can get you up and running quickly. The more time you spend researching this decision, the more time you're not selling. The underwriting process is not likely to differ much between providers (with the exception of PayPal, who seems to do their underwriting after the fact - but that's an entirely different and frightening subject), but there are some truly frightening APIs out there, and a couple very good ones.<p>The process you describe is what many merchants do. They validate the card info when the user signs up / orders the product, and charge when it ships. Any gateway should be able to support this model, some do it more elegantly and intuitively than others.<p>This is right in my wheelhouse - I work in the industry. Stick to the above points, and you should be okay.",1284179238

1680976,comment,1680149,1680443,0,0,thristian,,,"Yeah, I was (metaphorically) waving my hand in the air and yelling ""Factor! Factor!"" for the first half of the essay, but when I got to the end I wasn't so sure. Factor solves a lot of the problems the author describes - it has an extensive standard library, and garbage collection, and all kinds of other useful things - but I think the core complaint about writing Forth code still stands: You still have a data stack, stack-shuffling words like 'dup' and 'over' and 'rot' still make for ugly, hard-to-read code, and re-thinking your expression-graph to be expressible without such shuffling is still very hard.<p>I still have a local checkout of Factor in my home directory, and I really would like to get around to playing with it some more, someday - but (at least to begin with) playing with Factor sometimes feels very much like hard work.",1284178679

If you have guns in your house with kids they will take a very keen interest in you. There are DCFS rules for what you can/will/should do with guns in your home that may exceed what you would do. If the DCFS agent finds your gun not locked by an XYZ lock your kids will be taken from you. I am not joking either.<p>Every attempt you make to establish your rights will lead you further down the path of their goal.

I'm not, however, going to get morally outraged over another person's business decision to participate in a transaction just because a third-party doesn't think the remuneration is equitable.  The indie developers that are participating obviously liked the deal they were offered well enough, right?  Otherwise they wouldn't have agreed to participate.  I think griping about a deal that you agreed to after the fact is unprofessional.   If you were a schmuck and agreed to a bad deal, you just have to suck it up and learn from it.<p>I can think of one great reason I would personally consider participating in this ""inequitable"" arrangement if I were a Mac shareware developer:  any future revenue from upgrades are not shared with MacHeist.  I don't see where Gruber takes that into consideration.  I had never heard of a few of these applications until MacHeist promoted them, yet I'm likely to upgrade any of the apps I actually like as they release new versions.  MacHeist is a form of advertising, and all advertising is somewhat of a calculated risk...this promotion will probably pay off for some of the developers and be a waste of time for others.  Either way, it's not my job to count my neighbor's coins for them.",1200208052

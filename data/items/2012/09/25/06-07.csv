4569029,comment,4568426,4568877,2,0,thaumaturgy,,,"Er, no, you cannot, by definition.<p>Einstein is a popular example cited by both sides because he's become the very caricature of a scientist, and because he said things which satisfies many religious views.<p>I own a copy of The Quotable Einstein, and that book has several nice qualities: it is short (and easy to browse); it is organized by subject; and within each subject, the quotes are organized chronologically.<p>So it is easy for me to see that Einstein's views on God and religion changed throughout his life, and as he became older, he left his belief in a personal God and moved towards a belief system where ""God"" merely referred to the intrinsic beauty of what Einstein saw as the laws that govern the universe.<p>For example, in 1915: ""Why do you write to me, 'God should punish the English'? I have no close connection to either one or the other. I see only with deep regret that God punishes so many of His children for their numerous stupidities, for which only He Himself can be held responsible; in my opinion, only His nonexistence could excuse Him."" (In a letter to Edgar Meyer, a Swiss colleague. Note that here Einstein is not actually claiming a lack of belief in such a deity -- yet.)<p>In 1930: ""I cannot conceive of a God who rewards and punishes his creatures, or has a will of the kind that we experience in ourselves. Neither can I nor would I want to conceive of an individual who survives his physical death; let feeble souls, from fear or absurd egoism, cherish such thoughts."" (From ""What I believe"".)<p>In 1952: ""My feeling is religious insofar as I am imbued with the consciousness of the insufficiency of the human mind to understand more deeply the harmony of the Universe which we try to formulate as 'laws of nature'.""<p>In 1953: ""To assume the existence of an unperceivable being ... does not facilitate understanding the orderliness we find in the perceivable world.""<p>In 1955: ""I have never imputed to Nature a purpose or a goal, or anything that could be understood as anthropomorphic. What I see in Nature is a magnificent structure that we can comprehend only very imperfectly, and that must fill a thinking person with a feeling of humility. This is a genuinely religious feeling that has nothing to do with mysticism.""<p>People who say that Einstein ""believed in God"" should read more of what he wrote. :-)",1348556252

The pendulum will swing in our favor as long as we do something about it and not just ""expect"" Cupertino to release an iPhone 10 that will be the ""greatest thing to happen to iPhone since iPhone"" (seriously?).<p>It's interesting to see how Apple is becoming very much like Microsoft recently. The closed (and getting more closed) ecosystem, with additions such as Gatekeeper on OS X ML and the Nazi-like regime in the iOS App Store. The lawsuits left and right, the lack of innovation. Quite frankly, I don't really remember Microsoft exhibiting such arrogance - something you see more from Oracle, but let's forget the Enterprise for a minute.<p>I think Apple's walled garden is getting taller and taller, but there's a bigger problem: consumerism just doesn't care. The people who waited days to get the new iPhone - they don't care. They just go forward, like a heard of sheep, whatever Apple says, they do. They applaud and are deeply caught up entranced in the ""magic.""<p>I don't think (hope) the future of computing lies with Apple, iOS, consumerism, the RIAA, shit bills introduced by gov't to limit the web, and etc. I think the INTERNET is still run by hackers, engineers, people who live and breathe code, we built this thing damn it and we're going to pass it on to our kids, beter, more open, more robust than ever before. The freedom of information, the ability to share and communicate, the ability to create better worlds through software, it's all there - the fact that Apple and Jobs added a golden veil of design doesn't mean it's lost - just skewed at the moment. It's business and dollars, and people like their closed iOS, gatekeeper, iPhone and ""the New iPad.""<p>I have tons of respect for a company like Google who try to stay open in the hostile, big-business consumerism-dominated technology sector. They encourage innovation, they want the Internet to grow as an ecosystem, open, fast and easily accessible for everyone.<p>Technology is about choices and while we're getting less and less from Cupertino with their Nazi-like regime (including dwindling innovation), there is a lot of positive innovation left and right. From Shenzhen alleys producing $35 A-Pads, to Linux boxes like the Rasberry Pi, to thousands of different Android devices - we are prime for change and a breakthrough from the sandbox.<p>We just have to work hard and do it.",1348555546

Answer: Nothing, because you gave them an exclusive nonrevocable license to your data.  If you really wanted control over your personally identifiable data then it would probably be wise not to submit it to a site that gets scraped and cached by Google (from which anyone can make fair use) and certainly not under a license that gave you no control over the data after it's submitted.  You would want a site that has some sort of protections like passwords, that allows some degree of pseudo anonymity so your name is not embedded in an evergreen search engine cache; and you would want the right to tell the site to remove/delete the data at your direction, if that became necessary (e.g. in your example scenario).<p>In short, Craigslist really isn't in the business of protecting your data for you.

Building HTML and JavaScript since 1996 (GeoCities, HotDog, and HomeSite). Nerded around with programming 1995-1997 in high school (TI Basic, Pascal, and Qbasic) In the days when I started web development, a lot of folks were still monkeying around with Perl and flatfiles. I can't really speak to early days of Java: until 2000, didn't really use it. ColdFusion 6 went from C++ to Java, at which point CF devs ran on the JVM and could target it.<p>From the beginning I was a consumer of RDBMSes. Started with \nAccess and moved on to SQL Server. There wasn't a need to know the full DB, only the pieces you needed for CRUD. Perhaps for newbs that has changed, and they have to learn the full SQL administrative experience. Personally I doubt that. Do some db migrations in Rails: you don't even need to know what SQL engine you're running on.

Let us step back for just a moment from the pinhole view of this one subject and realize that the primary job of educators is to teach students <i>how to think</i>.<p>If a student is shown pictures (or, better yet, up-close-and-personal on a field trip!) of geological strata, and shown how the processes work that formed those features, and then they are given a counter-argument by other authority figures that everything that they've seen there is wrong because <i>faith says so</i>, what is that doing to those students' ability to reason?<p>Do you not think that a widespread disregard for the easy-to-understand concept of evolution would also spill over into a widespread disregard for other fields of study? Creationism is the color guard of anti-intellectualism; shame on anyone who would try to rationally argue that we should not run it out of our educational institutions with the broadswords of critical thinking and rational curiosity. [1]<p>Do you think that people who grow up believing that a religious book written nearly 3,000 years ago is more informative on the topic of natural sciences than all of the scientific efforts since will really have any opportunity in the world's science & technology arena? I don't.<p>Why should we not argue instead in favor of the principles of enlightenment? In the late 1600s, in an effort to defend its religion, the Scottish Kirk established schools around the country that would teach <i>anybody</i> -- no matter their social standing -- the basics of reading and writing. What followed soon after was a period of industrial and technological and economic development in Scotland that rivals any other enlightenment period in Europe.<p>It takes a remarkable ignorance of human history to argue against education.<p>If you want to change the communities that these kids come from, <i>you have to teach them how to do it</i>. And that includes teaching them evolution, and making sure that they understand why creationism is bad thinking.<p>[1]: Nothing personal; I'm not attacking you specifically here, but it <i>is</i> frustrating to see so many ""what's the big deal?"" comments -- this is precisely the sort of intellectual atmosphere created when 46% of the population rejects basic scientific principles.",1348553559

They're not very useful for the customer, though.<p>Customers want to feel as though there's a real person they can contact directly. They don't want to feel as though they'll simply be shunted endlessly from department from department. My opinion is that the customer shouldn't need to learn how your company is structured simply to make a one-off complaint or ask a question. The onus should be on the company to receive the support query and then pass it along to somebody who can answer it.<p>I'm aware this a less obviously scaleable approach to support. For some companies, it's not really tenable. In many cases, the value of a single customer may be so low that providing good support isn't worth it... it may be more valuable to simply ignore that customer until they leave. But for companies in which every customer is valuable, or <i>could</i> be valuable (Mailchimp, for example, or Zendesk), this kind of ""inefficient"" customer-centric support makes sense.",1348553506

4568882,comment,4568426,4568740,3,0,bsphil,,,"I was never a ""fundamentalist"" or anything that could be described that, but I was strongly religious until about 17-18 years old.  However, I always had a nagging problem with biblical stories because I was also a good student and had trouble resolving the inherent conflict between those two realities.  I tried since probably second grade to come up with an explanation that made sense in both worlds.<p>Maybe that was only because I grew up in a particularly open-minded Lutheran church.  It wasn't until I got older and was in confirmation classes in middle school that the assistant minister admitted that Christians literally believe the Earth is a few thousand years old.  They were always very open to everyone, but they also begrudgingly concluded that homosexuality was a sin when I was in high school Sunday school classes.  Incidents like that really helped to jar my personal beliefs and for the first time ever, honestly question what I believed to be true.<p>Up until then, I partially did believe and partially did what people said.  It took a lot of self-reflection (over several years) to realize that my beliefs were a direct result of being told what is ""truth"" in the religion that everyone I knew was a part of.  I've been bringing this up in discussion with three of my friends as I was going through that period, and as a result of their own self-reflection, two have become atheist and one is more or less fed up with organized religion.  It's a hard thing to face, and I can't get too upset that people react so defensively when the things they so adamantly and unquestionably believe are questioned by someone else.  All I'd ask is that people make an honest effort to step back and evaluate why and how they came to their faith.  Very smart people have done some amazing things while also being religious (Issac Newton basically invented modern calculus to explain the gravitational fields of the solar system and their interaction, yet was religious and an alchemist).<p>Based on the trends of demographics, I think this issue is likely going to sort itself out over time.  The only concern is how fast it will go and how much will we delay the progression of knowledge.  Long-term trendlines mean far less to the person who is stuck waiting for a turn.  You won't be able to berate believers into changing their minds with facts and counterarguments, regardless of their validity.  That's not how the human brain works.<p>As an aside, I just went to a wedding this weekend and got my first direct exposure to a religious event in a couple years now.  Having been gone that long, the entire process felt a little creepy.  Particularly when everyone kept saying ""lord hear our prayer"" in unison, out in the middle of the wilderness by a river.

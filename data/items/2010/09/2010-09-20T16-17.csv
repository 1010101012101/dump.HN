Few thoughts on it:<p>As Gabriel mentioned in the blog post - ""Identify people that would make good mentors, i.e. with the right domain experience."" The site looks very generic from outside and forces me to signup without even giving me a peek of kind of people I can expect to see in the community.<p>I might be looking for a startup mentor in a particular domain, and may be there is none of that type on it right now. Or may be some people on it are providing mentor-ship on how to go about learning a specific skill like flying etc that I am interested in, but since I have no clue, I probably won't sign up.<p>You can think of highlighting a few profiles or at least a few categories helping a visitor understand whether (s)he should join this community or not.<p>Good luck, and hope it becomes a good success.",1285001983

I could go out back and dig a giant hole with a spoon. Should I be paid for the rest of my life for digging this hole? Your idiot reasoning says 'YES! It is hard earned work you deserve royalties!'.<p>As for your ramblings on identity theft: I think we have a mismatch of definitions. For me Identity Theft is not information copying, it is using that information to cause loss to the person, e.g. withdrawing from that person's savings. The copying of the information is not the theft, it happens all the time without negative consequences. You are defining identity theft as ""having the information, whether it is used or not"".<p>You are being intellectually dishonest again here. You use the emotional topic of ID theft, which is a broad term containing several different sub-components, and then redefine it to be isomorphic to copyright infringement. Even when clarifications to what actions and subcomponents of ID theft are actual theft, you insist on ignoring those portions to make some other point.  In short, stop being a wanton fool.",1285001934

This kept me entertained through elementary school and into middle school. I remember trying to learn C in junior high, but none of the tutorials I found were all that helpful. None of them ever mentioned what a compiler was or where I could get one, so I was lost as to how to turn source code into an actual runnable program. Junior high math classes led to more problems to play with (and a programmable calculator to use for playing with them). In high school, I took all of the programming classes offered. It wasn't until about then that I decided to go into computer science -- before that, I'd been most interested in biology.",1285001825

1709493,comment,1708556,1709403,0,0,lispm,,,"No language had lexical closures in 1958. ALGOL had lexical scope, but not closures. So their part was easy. On a language level all the consequences were explored with Scheme in the 70s. Before that their were individual solutions found to create closures.<p>Read the history of the FUNARG problem (1970).<p>FP languages came up later. The first ML appeared in something like 1972/1973. I'm not sure if that had lexical closures. I doubt that. The Lisp community was one active part of the FP community that detected the problem and eventually found a solution. Scheme was the first language to demonstrate that (1975). Other FP languages also went that route (ML, where the first ML was implemented on top of Lisp, IIRC). The MacLisp branch took some time to adopt lexical closures. First a special construct was introduced to create a closure. In some other implementations the compiler was using lexical scope, but not the interpreter. Common Lisp was then in 1984 the next major Lisp dialect that settled for lexical scope (incl. closures) for both interpreted and compiled code.<p>The Lisp community (other than Scheme) had substantial code at the end of the 1970s, so there was some reluctance to move to lexical closures. Lexical closures also made the implementation a bit more difficult. The interpreter is simpler without them. There were also performance issues to overcome.",1285001644

Certainly that doesn't seem to be the case if you're working from salary alone.<p>Let's assume our developer enters the workforce at 24 and we're considering 38 to be ""late 30s"".  Then she's worked 14 years, we'll assume at an average of $90K/yr, yielding 1.26 million in total income if you ignore interest, inflation, etc.<p>Various forms of tax will eat about 40% of that [1], so you're left with $756K out of the gate.<p>Suppose by shrewd living you're spending no more than 15% of your income on housing (which is half of the typical assumption), that's $189K over 14 years, leaving $567,000.<p>In 2005, the average cost of food <i>at home</i> for a family of 2 on a ""moderate"" plan was ~$475 (for a family of 4 that jumps to $675 to $810 depending upon the age of the children) [2].  Let's use $475 as an average. So that's another $79,000 for the 14 years (168 months), leaving you with $488,000 for a family of 2, or $453,600 for a family of 4.<p>So working from salary alone, you're under half a million just by taking into account quite frugal budgets for housing and food, and that's without accounting for costs of transportation, insurance, medical, entertainment, etc. let alone the costs of raising children.<p>I'm certain with the right decisions or investments it can be done, but I think if this were ""easy"" to do you'd see a lot more people with a lot more money in the bank.<p>[1] <a href=""http://articles.moneycentral.msn.com/Taxes/Advice/YourRealTaxRate40.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">http://articles.moneycentral.msn.com/Taxes/Advice/YourRealTa...</a>

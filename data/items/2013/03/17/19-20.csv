5390741,comment,5389101,5390353,2,0,robhawkes,,,"> The sky is the limit. Literally, when is sky coming? ;)<p>Definitely one of my favourite comments about the project so far! =p<p>The rough and ready approach we took to transforming data was to import the shapefiles into PostGIS using pgShapeLoader, doing any manipulation in PostGIS and exporting straight out to GeoJSON using the ST_ToGeoJSON method in PostGIS, or using the GeoJSON options in ogr2ogr. From there it's a simple case of importing the JSON into Three.js and constructing the objects from the vertex coordinates.<p>Re: Combining statistical data with the geographic data, we can do that with GeoJSON and you can use ogr2ogr to include related data about each location when exporting to GeoJSON.<p>The choropleth map is something we constructed from scratch. In reality, it's nothing more than a bunch of shapes in Three.js that each have a different material colour – it's very simple.<p>D3.js is a fantastic place to start. In fact, that's exactly where we started with all this. We actually use the Geo module within D3 for a few parts of ViziCities.<p>We haven't decided yet about opening the full project but we'll certainly be documenting and releasing aspects of it (most of the juicy bits). We'll announce that via the @ViziCities Twitter account.<p>As for the sky… it's coming ;)",1363550287

5390730,comment,5390420,5390420,36,0,tokenadult,,,"I wonder how many people are willing to take on the real adventure of living in any of the twenty poorest countries in the world, or twenty most tyrannical countries of the world (there is overlap between the two sets) to try to change those from the inside. When I was in high school, going to a high school that was named after an astronaut just after the first moon landing, I thought it was completely natural to have the ambition to be the first man to set foot on Mars. I'm stunned that at this late date I could STILL be the first man to set foot on Mars.<p>But as I grew into adult life, and visited more than one country here on Earth, I began to think that it is an even higher and more challenging ambition to go somewhere you are not constrained to go by desire for fame or for riches or for being the first in a new territory, but rather by a desire to solve intractable problems. Solving a problem of long standing is a bigger achievement than solving a problem that is unsolved mostly just because no one has found it worthwhile to solve it. Making any of the world's poorest countries richer in general, or making any of the world's most oppressed countries freer in general, is a problem for which some example solutions exist, just as traveling to other planets has some precedent in the manned moon missions and in robot space probes, but I suggest it is actually a much tougher and more interesting problem, a problem more worthy of a gnarly man willing to risk his life. I still admire astronauts, and I've exposed all four of my children to books and films about space exploration, but I'd be even more thrilled to see them or other young people I know take on the exploration challenge of bringing about improvement in the lives of their fellow human beings in the worst-off parts of planet Earth. There is a lot of challenging science involved in those problems, and the contributions to human knowledge that will come from solving those problems will provide lasting benefit to all of humankind, whatever planet our descendants live on.<p>AFTER EDIT: Two comments below mention ""paternalism."" Nope. I am talking about ""fraternalism,"" sharing in the life of the people where you live, understanding their problems deeply because they become your problems too, and then building solutions from the neighborhoods you live in. You can't jet-set that in, and you can't phone it in or international consultant it in, you can only live it in. I've asked before here on Hacker News how many of the participants here have ever even lived in (not just visited, but lived in) a third-world country. Not many have. (I have, and it was a dictatorship when I lived there, and as a foreign national I was part of the process of nudging it to become the democracy it is today.) To be a brother of your fellow human beings is a great adventure. It's harder than armchair criticism, but also more challenging and interesting.",1363550135

5390727,comment,5390420,5390687,1,0,cryptoz,,,"> So just getting to Mars would exceed the safe limits<p>This is the problem with your argument that I'm underestimating risks. You're assuming that nobody finds a way to solve this problem or to mitigate the effects of the radiation, and that nobody would be willing to find a way to go even with the health concerns. I know this will be extremely difficult and quite costly, but I think hard work and constant innovation will solve a lot of the specific problems that you pose today.<p>> Multiple years in space and Mars gravity will also have severe impacts on bone density and muscles. You're never going to be able to fly to Mars, spend a few years, and fly back and resume your life on Earth without long-lasting health effects.<p>Prove it. Until you do, I disagree. Also, so what if it's true? Hundreds of millions of people on Earth voluntarily partake in long-lasting negative health effects habits. Why can't ""living on Mars for a bit"" be one of them?",1363550105

The idea is to redistribute wealth and the government's income is irrelevant (hence the GP's saying it ""won't do anything"" despite the obvious increase of this income).<p>For all we know a tax increase may decrease the total money collected by the government as the wealthy flee into more favorable tax regimes.

A market with some simple rules governing violence and the enforcement of contracts is certainly more free than a Soviet style planned economy. You can neither have a perfectly free market nor a perfectly controlled market. Even North Korea has a black market. Generally when talking about about the 'freedom' of a market, the measure which matters is not the arbitrary number of regulations which exist but the ability of players (both individuals and firms) to freely and knowingly enter into contracts and transactions.

The way I remembered it, having a blog was the hottest thing, and RSS is the solution that bring the blogs to the customer. Desktop clients are spawning everywhere (like Twitter clients a couple of years ago). It was a big when Firefox added support for RSS, and then my favorite email client back then, Thunderbird also had RSS reader built-in.<p>IMHO, it was the rise of _Web 2.0_ (oh boy, that term sounds so corny now) and uncontested Google domination of the web that made Google Reader <i>the</i> RSS client.<p>The article is right about one thing though, it's Flipboard and other ""smart"" reader apps killed Google Reader.

They made a reasonable engineering and product tradeoff to increase their system's scalability, decrease it's latency, and allow new kinds of applications that are able to serve more than one request at once (eg. node.js servers holding onto tons of idle websockets).<p>Given an increasingly large infrastructure (which makes stronger queueing much harder if you don't want to add a lot of latency) and strong requests from customers to allow other languages that don't fit into the ""one fast request per process"" paradigm, I can absolutely see making that tradeoff. It makes the infrastructure simpler (and thus more robust), cuts some latency, and makes the many loud customers who wanted to run things like node.js happy.<p>Doing so, I would have been aware that in some cases, this would lead to suboptimal routing that increased latency, but I never really would have thought it would have as devastating effects on an application's overall performance as Rap Genius saw.<p>So yes, they do care a lot more about this issue now that there has been a big stir about it, but I think it's reasonable to assume that this may be more because they've realized it can have a huge impact on overall latency rather than a moderate one, and that it's come to their attention that some of their messaging and docs hadn't been updated reflecting the routing change.<p>But given how great of a company Heroku usually is, the fact that it is not in their interest to decrease their quality of service, and that there are very legitimate reasons to move away from intelligent routing (namely, the facts that it doesn't really make sense for applications that can do multiple requests concurrently and that it is extremely difficult to scale), I'm inclined to believe that this is more a mistake than a malicious lack of concern for their customer's well-being that they are only addressing due to vocal outside pressure.",1363546869

Term insurance is something that one should always get after getting married (or even before if your family is dependent on you). Multiple term insurances can be bought so you can keep buying more as your liabilities increase.",1394704780

7390847,comment,7390638,7390794,9,0,Blahah,,,"Sure.<p>The WHO produces a report on causes of death wordwide[0]. Heart disease and stroke are the biggest killers, but these are, like cancer, really quite complex. Diarrhoeal diseases and respiratory infections kill a ridiculous number of people, but these are largely solved problems in the western world. Organisations like the Gates Foundation are doing great work exporting what we know about these diseases to the developing world, but governments do a pitiful amount. A number of chronic lifestyle diseases are rising: lung/throat cancer (due to smoking) and diabetes (due to eating sugar). My suggestion is that we should prioritise disease research and treatment based on how many people are dying and how easily those problems could be solved. But because funding bodies are all human, and all in the developed world, the disease they most fear is cancer.<p>Regarding food security, there is technically enough food produced in the world to feed everyone, if we could solve the distribution and storage problems and prevent rich governments&#x27; protectionist interference in agricultural markets and corruption in developing nations&#x27; governments. But a large amount of that wastage is also not really suitable for human nutrition. Probably the fastest way to alleviate hunger is to enable each part of the world to feed itself with food produced nearby. Because we&#x27;ve reached the limits of arable land in much of the world, this means making more land suitable for food production, finding new ways to provide water, and making crops be able to grow better in different conditions. The FAO&#x27;s State of Food Insecurity report[1] is a good summary.<p>0. <a href=""http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs310/en/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs310/en/</a>.<p>1. <a href=""http://www.fao.org/publications/sofi/en/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.fao.org/publications/sofi/en/</a>",1394704638

It had its chance. It used to have high install rates.  It was placed about as perfectly for success as you could hope to be. If it hadn&#x27;t failed so miserably at what it set out to do and be (and instead succeeded in a different area), we would be using it now, and living in the utopia you wish for.<p>As an aside, a lot of your complaints against web technologies make it sound as if there is a cohesive group of people designing something and doing it wrong.  Actually it&#x27;s a much more chaotic process involving a diverse group of people and companies and competing interests.

I really don&#x27;t want to sound like a narcissist and I&#x27;m not trying to judge in the least, but I&#x27;m curious why the OP wasn&#x27;t more diligent about planning ahead in terms of health insurance given he made a decision to have/raise four children.<p>Do people really not take into account stuff like children&#x27;s education, cost of living expenses per additional member of family, emergencies, black swan events? I know my parents decided to have only X number of kids because they knew that they wouldn&#x27;t be able to provide well for more than X children. This was a conscious decision given that my father grew up with 7 siblings and my mom says she would have had more children if they would have been able to provide for them.<p>Also I&#x27;m genuinely curious whether $20,000 for a final resting place seems like a good amount to put on a list of priorities given all the other costs involved? Mortgage and transportation seem like good goals, but minus the cancer, if some one else decided to raise money from the internet to spend it on traveling, I&#x27;m not sure a lot of the comments would be so positive?<p>I&#x27;m really sorry for being so negative, but these are general questions that I have and they are in no way directed towards the OP.

Even though I guess there is no need to actively sent too many information out in space as we do already have a kind of &quot;frequency pollution&quot; broadcasting TV channels, TCP packets etc. There are many signals travelling from earth to space all the time - communication with satellites doesn&#x27;t end on them, remember: it&#x27;s radio we use for communication!<p>You can easily imagine what it must be outta there when aiming at the earth with some kind of antenna: just imagine a world on which air isn&#x27;t throttling voice-signals (aka shouting/talking). Those signals would keep floating around until they are reflected by some kind of object. Well, in space there aren&#x27;t that many objects so our little earth is already looking like a big frequency mess and a kind of big light bulb for other guys out there. We just have to wait until all our civilization-generated signals are arriving at other parts of the galaxy.&#x27;<p>You can argue whether this is a wise thing to do this so naively but it&#x27;s already too late to stop this from happening and to be honest: we can only do assumptions based on things we do know, so we simply have to speculate when it comes to aliens.

Every one claims to be doing agile, even though they pick and choose the parts they decide are &quot;agile&quot;.<p>I just continue to write software the way I always have. Kind of disciplined version of cowboy coding I would say. Sometimes I have design documents - when I feel it helps. Other times the problem might be less clear, built a prototype, and iterate from there. It really depends on the problem you are trying to solve and the time frame you need to do it in.<p>I get software working, usually in a decent time frame.

IIRC, I asked about this before and was told Dev Tools does support deobfuscating globals as far as the stack frame is concerned.  The fact that we are still seeing obfuscated function names on the call stack I think is our bug.<p>Edit: I take that back. I just looked at the Blink source code, as far as I can tell, it throws away the name index. Therefore, Chrome Dev Tools won&#x27;t deobfuscate symbols, but Google server-side JS deobfuscation framework will, which is a pitty. I guess it is time for a Chrome Dev Tools patch. :)",1394701602

The guy did show his work to Microsoft, they said ""Nice idea, yoink"". He did indeed have a patent on the idea. He won an appeal based on the fact that the judge did not listen to a jury's opinion on the case. So they got a jury, and the jury voted in favour of Richardson.<p>And the judge again ignores the jury. What the hell, man?",1254297214

That is, every possible answer would be in the set.<p>And I am certain I am not unique. Indeed, half of the enjoyment in getting to know someone is in the mutual effort expended in trying to understand how the other person was formed: thoughts, feelings, desires, etc - and this enjoyment is independent of the actual thoughts, feelings, etc themselves.<p>As relationships grow, both parties discover the thoughts, feelings, desires, etc. that were perhaps, formed irrationally - and then adjust accordingly. This is called personal discovery - and is evidence enough that most people are too inconsistent and too nearsighted for an approach such as the one okcupid employs.<p>That said - I wish them the best of luck.",1254294958

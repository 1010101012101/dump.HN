So you can search for a ticket price on the 1st of a month and it would be the same as on the last day of the month.<p>I know that this is probably not realistic since you can&#x27;t just open up an airline like you can a startup, but it would be interesting if it was possible and see who gets a bigger revenue/piece of the pie: the airlines with the uber-sophisticated yield management systems, or the one that treats customers as people and not factors in an equation.<p>It&#x27;s probably very difficult to even do the mental experiment, but I sure would be glad to see these kind of companies show up. I know there are already lots of companies that treat customers as their most valued asset instead of just a cash-cow, and almost in all cases that I can think of, these companies are doing great <i>precisely</i> because there&#x27;s more and more people that want to be treated like people, and are willing to pay extra for that, instead of getting the lowest price and be kicked in the behind in the process.",1418684245

8754976,comment,8751946,8754827,0,0,Osmium,,,"> I do molecular dynamics simulations (and am in fact performing simulations on graphene currently), and an individual layer of graphene easily stays intact in both a vacuum and other environments.<p>You can make a lot of &#x27;stable&#x27; things in molecular dynamics simulations that don&#x27;t exist in reality ;) You could construct any number of 2D materials that exist quite happily because they&#x27;re close to some local minima or other, or because of some quirk of the potential forcefields you use. So I don&#x27;t think &quot;I can make it exist in a computer&quot; is necessarily a good reason for expecting it to exist in reality, even if in the case of graphene it&#x27;s relatively straight forward. Though useful, classical molecular dynamics is also quite dumb: it&#x27;s really good for simulating known materials, but not so much for discovering new ones.<p>As for &quot;2D&quot; materials generally...well, we can make monolayers of a lot of things, sandwiched between other materials. And we can make other things that act like they&#x27;re 2D even if they&#x27;re not. There&#x27;s nothing spectacular about it per se. The difficulty, as with all these materials, is that predicting that something has useful properties and actually being able to manufacture it at scale and relatively defect free is <i>huge</i>. You&#x27;re fighting entropy, basically. So I think the surprise was not that graphene could exist in principle, but that it could be made reliably.",1418684137

In World 1, every person has the same ability to pay and attachment to money - their willingness to pay changes only by virtue of how much they need the ride.  In World 2, every person needs the ride precisely as much, their willingness to pay is solely due to differences in their financial circumstance.<p>In World 1, the ideal response in every sense would seem to be surge pricing.  Those willing to pay a higher price would have their greater need met, at a price they agreed to.  Refunding them is fine but arguably unnecessary.<p>In World 2, we&#x27;re clearly discriminating by class (what you think about that depends on your moral framework; I don&#x27;t love it) by initially <i>presenting</i> the higher price, whether or not it&#x27;s refunded.

If it was rhetorical, I apologize for misunderstanding and answering.<p>I prefer not to define &quot;important&quot; in this context to avoid excluding any definitions subjective to those who may respond to my question. That way, I may learn both what makes a book important to someone and tips on remembering which were important.<p>Edit: Now that I know the question was intended for me, I&#x27;ll provide a little more depth to my answer.<p>The first thought I had when considering what makes a book important is how strongly it resonated within me, and the intensity of my emotions when reflecting upon what I&#x27;ve learned or how my perspective changed shortly after reading it. I know those stronger emotions may derive from a bias I had at one point in my life, and may no longer have.<p>Therefore, I can&#x27;t help but think my definition is wrong because it&#x27;s relative to the period in my life which I read the book. So some books that were important before may not be now. That&#x27;s why I was curious to learn others&#x27; definitions of &quot;important&quot; books, and how to identify them for rereading.",1418683430

In fact you can generate a lifetime of work from it :)  PG always talks about making something for which you are the customer.<p>EverNote is of course a company in this space.  I used them for awhile; it&#x27;s nice that they have iPad clients and the like.  But I found their products to be a bit complex.<p>Here are some random things I want to fix:<p>- mobile access.  In the past 10 years, this was a huge change.  My Wiki is basically read-only on mobile devices.  I have to go back to the desktop or laptop to really write anything.  This is OK but I imagine there could be some mobile interface for typing or speaking and hyperlinking.  EverNote partially addressed this.<p>- Data model for bookmarks.  Actually I sort of poo-pooed the journal model in favor of a Wiki.  But to be honest I&#x27;ve realized that a lot of things are links which I find on HN and the like, which need a date, &quot;read&quot; tag, and free form notes.  It&#x27;s basically delicious / pinboard, but with an emphasis on comprehension and connections to previous ideas.<p>- Unsurprisingly, I&#x27;ve found the need for a spreadsheet-like data model for finances, and certain kinds of research.  Yes, I could just use a spreadsheet, but the hyperlinking and web hosting is huge.  I use Google Spreadsheets now but would like something a bit faster and more under my control.<p>- I like having these notes as my data for all time.  Delicious came and went in the last 10 years.  A lot of the value for me is that it&#x27;s personal, and not tied to any cloud service, which conflicts a bit with current business models.<p>- Search.  Right now I have a fast full text scan with sqlite.  I&#x27;ve wanted to write a script that would fetch bodies for all the links, put them in a full text indexer, and let me search quickly there.  And maybe take screenshots with PhantomJS.<p>- Information curation.  I have over 2000 pages now, and sometimes I probably forget to link back to stuff I should.  I create duplicate pages by accident.  This should be solveable with some hints.<p>- Stats on which pages I actually read.  With 2000 pages, I need some kind of ranking now.  Some are ancient/obsolete.<p>- Mirroring of my content hosted elsewhere... e.g. it would be nice to suck down my comments from HN and be able to search them later.  I had a lot of good conversations on UseNet way back that I wish I still had :)<p>Not sure if any of these are good business ideas, but those are my thoughts :)  A lot of them are partially covered by existing products.  But the the thing I am suggesting is for particular programmers to build the particular thing for themselves.  Everyone&#x27;s preferred mode of information organization will be a little different.  It&#x27;s nice to have something you made for yourself.  I think it&#x27;s a good exercise, because you can start very simple and gets you in the feedback loop of product use / product design / implementation.<p>But it&#x27;s possible it could lead to a company.  For me it to led to some other technology, like a web server container variant of WSGI / CGI (both of these have problems).  And backup / deploy stuff.<p>One problem is that companies are incentivized to go &quot;wide&quot; to acquire new customers.  But I want to go &quot;deep&quot; into my own use cases.  There are certain problems you only hit after you have 1000 pages.  Probably 99.9% of EverNotes customers don&#x27;t have that volume of content.",1418683146

We throw away the data but our model as well as its parameters are retained. The model as well as the parameters get refined with experience and it&#x27;s possible that the model is recursively made up of multiple models and that combination is governed by parameters which are also governed by experience. Realizing this has always been fascinating to me and it makes it clear that exposing the brain to more data in pretty deliberate ways can yield profound results. The &quot;smarter&quot; you are the less data you need. If you are not so smart/knowledgeable you need more data.

This is a very large problem and it is sad that clever people like you won&#x27;t lose sleep over either a lack of bio diversity or the destruction of old books. Resilience is a good thing to have, not a liability. Our dependence on nature is as large as it possibly could be and our knowledge of nature is surprisingly limited, especially of the intricate interplay between species.<p>A single species so obscure as to be unknown to us could very well be crucial to our survival. Let&#x27;s hope that such species become known before we find out they <i>were</i> crucial after all.<p>This is not a game of single datapoints invalidating theories, this is gambling on a scale that we can&#x27;t even begin to afford until we&#x27;ve moved off-planet and have multiple, completely independent biospheres capable of supporting complex life forms.

But if the goal is really to make financial institutions more accountable, my years of experience working in the industry tell me this will be a largely fruitless exercise. I expect the yield on mining public data for that nugget of information to nail a financial institution is going to be extremely low if not nil.<p>Financial institutions only have to disclose the highest, most superficial levels of information to the public when it comes to the breakdown/allocation of their assets and liabilities. If you open up central bank data or the notes to a FI&#x27;s financial statements, you will not find a meaningful delineation of where a banks assets are or what risk profiles they have.<p>Having worked in a very large commercial/investment bank and directly with the CFO, I know first hand that although banks avoid doing anything illegal, they will have no qualms with bending the rules in their favour. Most well run banks know exactly which rules are being bent and they will know exactly how to classify it in any public submission to prevent any smell. They have large finance and investor relations teams who pore over every decimal point in any report and have prepared answers to virtually all regulator questions.<p>The information you need to properly regulate banks are not in the public domain.<p>Take the last financial crisis for example. I don&#x27;t think any publicly available financial statement or report would have told you that banks were holding onto a tremendous volume subprime mortgages classed as &#x27;AAA&#x27;. This only emerged when huge holes appeared in balance sheets when the US economy slowed and a whole bunch of assets had to be written off.<p>The kind of remedy required to mitigate the chance of another crisis is a systemic overhaul of how banks are allowed to operate and how they are regulated. I&#x27;m sorry, but holding them to account with data provided by banks themselves will not yield much result.<p>EDIT: Sorry for being a jerk/cynic about this effort.

At the time I hated it, but looking back I learned a lot about what not to do and how to be a better programmer. I used the opportunity to create automated tools to clean up the code and experiment with new technologies.",1418681943

In the same vein, referring to state as values and behaviour as functions is too narrow. The lifecycle of the object is part of its state too, an object&#x27;s construction and destruction is part of its behaviour. That may sound like hair-splitting, but it can seriously trip you up and give you a wrong idea of what an object is in non-conventional settings.

Nyquist tells us that we only have 22.05kHz of signal present in the sample (well, one can hope, otherwise if the recording didn&#x27;t filter out everything above that when coding to PCM, we&#x27;re going to have a mess of aliasing going on, which is outside the scope of this post - just assume the person doing the encoding knew what they were doing, mkay...).  So, 22.05kHz.  And we want a resolution of 10Hz, so we&#x27;re going to need 22.05kHz / 10Hz = 2205 samples.\nOf course, we actually need double that in the time domain (we throw away the phase information remember), so we need 4410 samples in the time domain to get our 2205 samples in the frequency domain.  4410 samples at 44.1kHz sampling is equal to 0.1 seconds.<p>If I decide that I want a better frequency resolution, say down to 1Hz, then you quickly arrive at the conclusion that you will need a full second of samples.  In other words, your resolution in the time domain has decreased as you improve the resolution in the frequency domain.<p>You can improve a bit on this situation by using a sliding window with a carefully chosen windowing function.  The frequency information will still be smeared out in time, but the windowing function reduces the amplitude of a frequency the further it is from the centre of the sampling window, which sharpens up the smear a bit.",1418681265

Engineering is about trade-offs: if you rigorously separate view from logic from database, you make it harder to add features that must touch all three.  Conversely, if you make each feature its own file and add in hooks to the view/logic/database layer so they call out to plugins, you make it easy to add new features but very difficult to understand what each layer as a whole is doing.<p>The best you can do is choose the ideal architecture for <i>your</i> particular project, in the particular point in time that you&#x27;re working on it.  That&#x27;s why basically every software system needs to be rewritten as it grows up: the ratio of complete rewrites to new features to bugfixes to maintenance refactorings changes as the system matures and the requirements become more precisely known.

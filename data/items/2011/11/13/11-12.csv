I don't see Fred mentioning the stock issue at all in the article, and I don't see why the founder having a 'long roadmap' means that somebody who was given an amount of stock should have to give it back.<p>If the road map was so large, the stock plan should have reflected that, or maybe the company hasn't reached the value metrics at the intersection of road map and stock plan.<p>Either way, is that the fault of the employee? Why do the employees have to give back their stock? What about Pinkus? Is he putting his stock back into the pool also?<p>I haven't been actively following this story. So I'm sorry if I'm still a bit ignorant about it, but my main point is that I'm not sure this article is directly referencing the stock issue.",1321185547

And mainly fail, because we are so different from them.<p>It's fairly obvious that our countries usual musical output is pretty decent, and if we entered any of that into the contest, we'd win (If it was actually anything to do with the song).<p>I love the Eurovision song contest though, because it highlights how ridiculous the idea of integrating Europe is. You get countries who always vote for each other even when the song is rubbish, and you get no one voting for us, even when we have a half decent song. The Eurovision song contest is the best advert for a 'euro-skeptic'.",1321185240

But if a country is able to run a primary surplus over the long run, it means that the growth of its economy and its tax revenues is keeping up with the additional nominal debt. So the debt grows in absolute numbers but not relative to GDP. That's why the primary balance is generally considered a good measure for debt sustainability.<p>Still, you are right that they may not be reducing debt, but at least they are keeping it stable.",1321184977

My first thought was that it would be a potential disaster like the inflexible and pro cyclical American balanced budget laws, but the Swiss law seems very reasonable """"""It states that each year, the budget must be in balance, adjusted for economic conditions. This adjustment is made by multiplying expenditures by a cyclical factor (the ratio of trend real GDP to expected real GDP), thus either allowing for deficits during recessions or forcing lawmakers to have surpluses during booms.""""""<p>Since US GDP is currently far below potential GDP that would seem to allow for a substantial fiscal stimulus right now but force the government to save when the economy is stronger again.",1321184690

3230530,comment,3229360,3229928,8,0,pedalpete,,,"Hopefully I can give you some perspective here. I didn't know Steve Jobs, know very few people who have worked at Apple, none were key people.<p>This isn't the first book, article or interview that openly discusses Steve Jobs darker side. I haven't read the book, I'm not a Steve Jobs fan.<p>The book could very well be a hack job, but I doubt it. Nobody is a perfect human being. A book which follows both the amazing successes and the temperament and attitude which created them in an honest way is likely an effort to humanize Steve Jobs. I can understand why you wouldn't want your idol to be humanized. Why you don't want to read about their flaws. But at the same time, Steve Jobs was human.<p>I believe you are correct about Next and OS X, and I can't imagine bill gates saying 'none of the NeXT code made it into OS X'. Aren't they both still today based on the same kernel? Maybe Issacson misunderstood something, or maybe you misread it.<p>Either way, my point is that Steve Jobs flaws are widely known, but some of these flaws may have been responsible for his business success, some may have been detrimental to his personl successes. This we'll never know.<p>What we do know is that the man wasn't a god or a saint. He was a man, with character flaws just like the rest of us.<p>You seem to have taken it very personally, but I seem to recall the 60 Minutes piece saying that Steve didn't want to see the book, but gave his wife the responsibility of making sure it was true and fair.",1321184639

But if something is really important then the person who needs something done will find another way to contact you, or they will contact someone else who can get things moving.

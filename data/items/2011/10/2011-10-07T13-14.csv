3083974,comment,3080851,3082150,1,0,pbhjpbhj,,,"It's a statistical issue to some extent. How do you find your marble amongst a billion other marbles? Well if you know the colour and how hot it is then it's going to be relatively easy (use IR camera, select for temperature then pick out by visible colour spectrum).<p>Same here, AFAICT. They're using pion and kaon decay that produces muon neutrinos of known energies (in a range) travelling in a known direction. Solar neutrinos (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_neutrino"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_neutrino</a>) are created as electron neutrinos, though they flavour shift, they are mainly coming the direction of the sun and have differing energies to those created in the OPERA experiment via the CERN SPS.<p>I'd guess that you can cut out a lot of the background neutrino flux by running the proton capture (to generate the neutrinos) at around noon; I don't know if they time things to put the detector orthogonal to the local galactic plane but that would (to this layman) seem sensible too.<p>One thing that did strike me (lol?) was that the kaon/pion decay happens along a 1095m decay tube. As a sibling comment says they're not tracking individual neutrinos (you can't detect them twice) they're tracking a range of energy events (via the muon's created) at a range of positions along a 1km tube (via the muon trajectories presumably) and pairing them with a range of events at the other end such that they need to know the length of the transit over 730km to an accuracy of 20cm.<p>It's amazing stuff.<p>Edit: I should probably have said that of course they allow for the variances and the statistical nature and other systematic uncertainties, the graph showing the calculated uncertainties can be seen on the Wikipedia page, <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNGS"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CNGS</a>.",1317995964

Just because a concept is in the culture it doesn't mean that it has been realised.<p>>Really? All the dev tools I use work better on Mac than windows. I don't really care how well they work on Linux because the Linux desktop makes me spend too much time doing something I don't care about: administration (which is why I dropped Windows too, btw).<p>I have no experience with their dev tools so I can't comment on that. Hacker culture is one of freedom and exploration. If you're going to argue that Apple somehow represent those values then we should just move on to the next point.<p>>Nice, everyone loves judgmental people.<p>Just like everyone loves judging these words I'm typing?<p>>Even if you're right, who cares? As you say, he was a great entrepreneur. In some ways, that's the greatest of hacking: hacking the world into wanting something you've made.<p>The common word for that is marketing.<p>>Again, he put the computer in our hands in a way that no one had before (at least not to that level). If we ever get to the star trek or minority report (the good technology parts) world, what Jobs made will be the first steps of the stairs that take us there. That's not a ""superficial"" impact.<p>No, the first steps were made by Xerox, IBM, Stanley Kubrick, the writers of Star Trek, and various others. This is very far from the first step - the concept was already in place, material industries already had the capability to create things like gorilla glass, there were already hundreds of prototypes (i.e. the initial tablet PC's). Jobs did what any good business man does, he saw an opportunity and took it, to which I respond with an emphatic 'so what?'. It's like crack dealers say - 'if I don't sell it, someone else will'. That's the rule of business. Yet why do we forget that it wasn't Jobs who put in all of those thousands (millions?) of man-hours to develop these products? He provided some non/functional requirements then people who are competent with technology brought them to fruition. Why is one person saying 'this is good' or 'this is bad' get so much attention yet the people who did the work are not only forgotten about but have their labor attributed to someone else? One could argue that it wouldn't have happened without him. Well it wouldn't have happened without the 20,000 other people either.<p>Honestly, if I'm going to idolize someone then it damn well better be someone who's made humanity better off by helping to solve it's perpetual problems or exploring the boundaries of what we know. This is so boring in comparison. Someone packaged up existing stuff into a polished product and sold it to lots of people. I really don't get it.<p>And to everyone calling me a troll, that word is reserved for people who feign a type of personality in order to bait others into becoming angry. This is my opinion and I can assure you that I am not trolling.",1317995184

Before the iPhone, most people have only been exposed to touch via shitty kiosks, credit card readers and ATM machines.<p>I remember the skepticism around Jan 2007 when the iPhone was announced. They said, ""Pure touch? No way. Won't work. You need to have a keyboard."" I was one them! Even I said, ""yeah, the UI is pretty, but the touch screen probably sucks."" However, once I played around with my first iPhone, I bought one the next day based purely on the amazing performance of the touch keyboard.<p>Pure touch phones already existed in 2007 before the iPhone, but they sucked donkey balls. In fact, many of them still do. To downplay the iPhone's touch UI is disingenuous. To this day, the iPhone still has the best touch response on the market.

Somebody who's unfamiliar with it has no clue on how to even start solving it. Solving such a problem will add new techniques to your tool-belt for solving a whole class of problems.<p>Problems that I've found worth studying:<p>- Parsing. This is hard if you don't know the standard techniques: mostly recursive descent parsing with precedence -- or a parser generator, but that won't teach you much unless you write the generator yourself. Moreover I've found that you quickly run into limitations with parser generators and they don't make parsing easier in the long run, that's probably why most real world parsers are hand written (e.g. gcc, llvm). You can probably hack something together that sorta works, but knowing the right techniques makes writing an efficient parser that you have high confidence in a breeze. I've seen many ad-hoc parsers that would have benefited greatly from proper parsing.<p>- Constraint solving. Examples are solving sudoku, the zebra puzzle, SAT solving, optimal register allocation and many others. The three most important techniques are backtracking, constraint propagation and conflict learning. Even professional programmers can't do this if they don't know these techniques (e.g. <a href=""http://xprogramming.com/articles/oksudoku/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://xprogramming.com/articles/oksudoku/</a>).<p>- Interpretation/Compilation. In addition to being a hard problem, writing an interpreter and a compiler makes you understand how programming languages work. This is sometimes seen as a black art, but it is quite easy once you got the pattern.<p>- Numerical algorithms. The speed and the simplicity of numerical algorithms is astonishing. Newton's method is particularly amazing. In about 10 lines of code you can solve equations, do state of the art numerical optimization or solve differential equations. It can even handle problems that are usually considered to require specialized algorithms, like max flow and linear programming. It can also perform arithmetic operations, like division and square root.<p>- Machine learning. This gives you a different perspective on problem solving. Many people when presented with the task of spam filtering or determining the language a snippet of text is written in will respond with a hard coded scheme based on a lot of rules. A much better approach is to take a data set of known text and analyze the statistics of the data set and compare that with the snippet of task text. The same applies to many other problems.<p>What should be added to this list?",1317993173

In particular, the x-height of one sensible body font at a nominal 16px could easily be 50% more than the x-height of another. Sadly, while CSS lets us specify a stack of fonts to try, it doesn't yet let us specify a different size to go with each one so we can achieve a similar optical result. (CSS3's font-size-adjust might be intended to help here, but seems overcomplicated and underpowered to me.)<p>For another thing, these days pixel densities can vary by at least a factor of 3 between devices. The latest iThings sometimes do better than the 300dpi that used to the be benchmark for a laser printer. For a classic CRT or cheap and cheerful TFT, something more like 96dpi is common. At least you can detect this to some extent in CSS, because the new devices with very high densities also tend to support media queries so you can present larger text (in pixel terms) and higher resolution graphics accordingly.<p>If we're going to improve the way we present text (and graphics) on the web for people whose vision isn't perfect, it's going to take a much more flexible styling system for the web and probably a lot more real world experience of what works and what doesn't as well. As much as I respect people taking a stand on behalf of those who can't see as well as some, I'm not sure advocating a fairly arbitrary 16px guideline is helping.",1317993070

Saying that the world will be a better place after someone dies should be reserved for mass murderers and lobbyists - it's a harsh and inappropriate statement about a leading industry figure, whether you agree with that figure or not.<p>For example, I violently disagree with RMS on a lot of things, but I still believe he is a visionary, and Open Source is a valuable concept that will always be an important part of my life. And I won't be ""glad he's gone"" when his time comes. Too bad he can't do exactly that for Steve Jobs and give the man some respect. What he displays here is nothing but irrational hate, a mean and low move on RMSs part.",1317992805
3083758,comment,3083410,3083410,2,0,inflatablenerd,,,"The biggest failing I see this is argument is hierarchy. Sure, 16 point Georgia looks sexy as hell. If you have a text heavy website with little navigation, I'd definately recommend it. But in real world design situations, it's a mess. Even the Information Architects site looks flat. There's no easy way to guide the eyes because everything is ultra readable. There's no structure. It's an idealistic shortcut to readability.<p>For me, the most pleasurable reading experience I can think of is Instapaper on an iPad. What's the default size on that? I could be wrong, but I doubt it's anything larger than 14-16.<p>Besides, is it really a ""costly mistake""? Is Facebook is failure because the text is small? Is Apple's website is design disaster? Both sites (and many more) feature a mix of large and small text with modest sized body. They're navigation is thought out and structured.<p>The 16 pixels argument encourages the opposite of that.",1317992785

But he took into account most common DPIs. For the majority of users they do not vary that much, around 100-120 dpi.<p>(Btw, have you read the article?

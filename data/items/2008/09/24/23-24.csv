314248,comment,313482,313700,0,0,kamau,,,"Because programming and a computer science degree aren't the same thing, at least not in the way that being a physicist and a physicist degreee are. Computer Science is much more about the theory than the doing, and programming is much more about the doing than the theory. As i see it, programming is CS as to engineering is to its physics underpinnings. Now, you might say that you need a degree to be considered an engineer, and that's true. But there's also a long tradition of self builders, tinkerers, and people that just genereally get things done. Take the Wright Brothers for example - bicycle mechanics (not degreed engineers) tinker and come up with an airplane.",1222300630

The reason it has not been automated is that programmers by and large are Luddites.  They can admire new gadgets but not seismic changes in their work environment.<p>Anybody who has had the where with all to study for a BSc/MSc/PhD then most work in a commercial setting is going to be far far beneath their intellectual capabilities.<p>In short Compu Sci is best for a research role and commercial dev experience is best for producing a product.  The two are widely different beasts.<p>Personally, I have BSc in CompuSci and work in the commercial sector.  I think both Academia and Commercial use of computers is abysmal.  The last big step forward was in the 1960s for Academia and 1980s for business.  Since then it's all been downhill.<p>I have recent compu sci grads who cannot design a simple 8 bit cpu, what's an ALU.  This is just plain wrong.  I also have witnessed commercial developers who don't know how to treat clients.  In both cases why are these people even bothering to work in computing?<p>Most devs still think inheritance is more important than interface.  Just how far forward can we move with these fools slowing us down.<p>I think what it will take to move forward is a company saying if we do IT better we can rule the market.  Then finding some devs and ops with long experience and fresh ideas.<p>When a billion dollar company shows it can run it's IT with 20 people then we have progressed.

314225,comment,313866,313938,0,0,tjpick,,,"You are right about distinguishing between CS & SE. At least here in New Zealand there is a distinction between the two. I have a BE (software eng), which is internationally accredited, rather than a BSc (CS). The SE degree involves general engineering courses, and has a reasonable focus on reliabiliy, quality, safety etc. A degree like this makes you eligible for the professional engineering body IPENZ.<p>There is a mismatch between the education and what employers seem to look for. You see jobs titled ""software engineer"" that really only want an html/js coder or someone to set up a wiki, requesting CS degrees or equivalent experience. Jobs that really do demand rigourous software practices will hire anything they can get, but again mainly looking for CS degrees.<p>> Personally, I still think a CS degree is the best preparation right now to be a professional SE.\nI have to disagree. The best prep for a professional SE career is a professional SE degree, and then joining a professional body. Sure you can get a CS degree and become a programmer, that's fine. But you aren't really a professional engineer are you?<p>I'd say that there are reliable methodologies to build software but a lot of times these are not executed in any meaningful fashion. For the price people are willing to pay, and the time they will wait, quality software is not what they want. They may say they want quality, but they don't really. They really want something delivered yesterday, for free or cheap, that works most of the time and does most of the things they want. And this is what cowboys (uh... I mean ""software engineers"") deliver.<p>I don't really like the bridges analogy. The complexity and environment are too different for it to be meaningful when compared to software. Thing is, bridges have a well defined function, the banks don't move, the load is generally known (vehicles, people, etc) and so a stable structure can be delivered. And besides, plenty of bridges collapse. If there is an earthquake, or they are overloaded, or they get old, they topple.",1222299252
314224,comment,313482,313700,0,0,glomek,,,"My guess is that CS degrees are not valued because most of them are not particularly valuable.<p>The average CS department would flunk out most of their students, whither away, and die if they demanded the level of ability that MIT or Berkeley (for example) demand.  It would be better for the industry as a whole if this were to happen, but not for the instructors teaching in those average CS departments.<p>Top schools can afford to be demanding because they have talented people trying to get in.  Top schools can afford to teach theory and start with Scheme, because their students have some trust in them.  If Unknown U's CS department started with SICP and Scheme, a bunch of their students would go ""This is useless!"" and leave, so they use Java.<p>As it stands, a motivated self learner who buys and reads the textbooks used by top schools is likely to end up knowing far more CS than the average person with a CS degree.  Of course, this same motivated self learner, if they got a CS degree, would probably also end up knowing far more CS than the average person with a CS degree.  Net result?  You need to judge each individual on their own merits, and most CS degrees won't give you any shortcuts.",1222299223

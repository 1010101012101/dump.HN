Certainly, someone holding -- much less <i>seeking</i> -- at-will employment has little rational reason to be particularly committed to the company, as the company has made relatively little commitment to them (essentially, none beyond paying them for work already done, and not dismissing them for any legally-prohibited reason.)",1447883921

It helps to make friends if you are in a group-centric major - I was a chemist, so lots of long hours in the lab with cool people. There&#x27;s been some questions about whether the parents push too hard in these sorts of cases; for me, I was definitely motivated more by my own desire to get out in the world and start getting real things done. This isn&#x27;t always a productive desire - I wish I&#x27;d taken the time to learn more about the stuff that grew to interest me later (math/CS), instead of blitzing through all my chem requirements. I guess for other people doing the same thing the only advice I&#x27;d have is that while the cliche is that life is short, it&#x27;s really longer than you think it is at that age and you shouldn&#x27;t feel like you need to rush in order to maintain a position in some sort of race.

This is important in the run-up to a new version of Windows, because during the period when everyone knows that Windows X+1 is coming soon but all you can buy off the shelf are machines with Windows X, people want to be confident that they&#x27;ll be able to upgrade to Windows X+1 when it&#x27;s available.<p>For Vista, if your machine passed this certification, you got the right to ship it with a shiny sticker that said &quot;Vista Ready.&quot; Seeing the &quot;Vista Ready&quot; sticker on that XP laptop on the shelf at Best Buy told customers that they could buy it without fear. It was certified future-proof.<p>However, Vista required more resources than XP did to run with acceptable performance. That meant that OEMs had a ton of ultra-cheap XP machines in the pipeline that could not with a straight face be called &quot;Vista Ready.&quot; And this was a problem, because they didn&#x27;t want to get stuck with warehouses full of machines nobody would buy because they couldn&#x27;t run Vista.<p>So what they pushed for, and what MS eventually gave them, was a <i>new</i> certification: &quot;Vista <i>Capable.</i>&quot; Unlike &quot;Vista Ready,&quot; &quot;Vista Capable&quot; didn&#x27;t mean Vista would run <i>well</i> on the hardware in question. It just meant <i>you could install Vista on it</i>, with no guarantees as to how it would actually run. And the shiny &quot;Vista Capable&quot; sticker looked pretty much exactly like the shiny &quot;Vista Ready&quot; sticker, so if you weren&#x27;t looking carefully, it was easy to confuse the two.<p>The OEMs <i>loved</i> this solution, because they could now slap &quot;Vista Capable&quot; stickers on all those crappy XP machines and unload them on people. But, <i>entirely predictably,</i> then Vista came out and suddenly tons of people were installing it on hardware that was nowhere near beefy enough for it. So for umpty-ump millions of people who bought that crappy hardware, the experience of using Vista was painful and awkward and slooooow. Eventually even the cheapest machines were powerful enough to meet Vista&#x27;s requirements -- but by that point Vista&#x27;s reputation had been sealed. As the saying goes, you never get a second chance to make a first impression.<p>But the OEMs did get all that inventory out of their warehouses. So, you know, mission accomplished.",1447883099

However it should be emphasized that the issue in question is a scientific research study, not a policy decision by a Federal agency. As such, this is not an area of delegated legislative authority by Congress to the Executive (unless you are proposing that Congress should somehow legislatively overrule peer-reviewed scientific findings.)*<p>First, Mr. Johnson, cutely tries to defer that science is not going to be used in a policy manner. Right now, the President of the United States is engaged with making policy decisions from scientific studies, so his premise is flawed to begin with. Also, all of the pushes for climate change agendas feed from scientific studies.<p>Second, pointing to the delegation of authority and making a cute reference to legislating peer-reviewed scientific findings is a nod to The Daily Show crowd&#x27;s jokester attitude.<p>Third, the last line from the paragraph says that &quot;you have not articulated a legitimate need for anything beyond what NOAA has already provided&quot; plays into my argument from before about a government agency obfuscating.<p>One could argue that the obfuscation is to hold a checks and balance, but then why is a legislature member worried about what the executive branch is doing?

A correct interpretation of a work is to discern what the author actually intended to communicate.  If I say to a coworker &quot;a meteor is about to strike earth, wiping out all life unless we do something about it&quot; and the listener interprets what I say to be a metaphor (perhaps they think that I am trying to  say simply that the project we are working on is in danger of falling apart) they may or may not be correct.  If I work at an accounting firm, the statement is probably metaphorical; if I work at NASA, probably not.<p>In any case, determining the meaning of a text depends upon the genre, and to understand that you need context.  The main issue that most Christian traditions have with literalists is that they try to interpret the texts without any of the original context, or without any acknowledgement that the Bible is an anthology of different books written by different authors for different purposes.<p>>It similarly seems incorrect to say ISIS is &quot;misinterpreting Islam&quot; by reading the Koran literally. It may not be the popular interpretation, and it may not be a pleasant interpretation, but that doesn&#x27;t mean it&#x27;s an incorrect interpretation.<p>You&#x27;re right, it may be a correct interpretation.  Understanding the correct interpretation of Islamic texts is important for those deciding how to approach the spread of violent Islamic teachings.  Should it be left to Islamic religious leaders who can leverage Islamic texts to spread a more peaceful (and accurate) teaching, or should the focus be to discredit Islam from the outside?<p>> &quot;Your interpretation of the Bible is wrong&quot; has no more validity than &quot;Your choice of religion is wrong&quot; in general.<p>Any given religious text was written by a human being to convey a set of ideas an claims.

It gives me hope for the state of modern political discourse.<p>You&#x27;ve presented an interesting distillation, that&#x27;s for sure (on your recommendation I shall read the article). It&#x27;s worth noting that there are probably multiple lessons to this experience or event and the relevance will change from person to person, but in a way that&#x27;s nitpicking.<p>My response to the notion of looking at these risks with fatalistic acceptance, is that we shouldn&#x27;t completely evaluate the impact of things like malnutrition, disease, violence, {climate change side-effects} in terms of death. Death is a nice common impact measure, same as money, which is why they&#x27;re so popular as they make the incomparable, comparable. But they should be seen as approximate representations of what we value, rather than what we value. Even if there isn&#x27;t a whole lot we can do to gain knowledge of when people are attacked or when they die, there are still values beyond death/money for which these events have meaning. Something could be done for those shared values even if it can&#x27;t be done for ourselves.<p>I agree with what you&#x27;re saying RE: surveillance. Two things:<p>(1) I don&#x27;t think we quite know the extent for which our military agencies are preventing harm, only the extent to which they haven&#x27;t. There could be a &quot;Red Queen&quot; effect where less surveillance is a net loss but more surveillance does nothing, or is also a net loss. Just a thought, and I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised.<p>(2) ISIS is using our compassion and our values against us: they say as much in their magazine.[0][1] If we don&#x27;t do the same to them then the fight will keep being asymmetric, but I don&#x27;t have any answers that aren&#x27;t probably wrong in some way. Already I&#x27;ve been drawing conclusions that I thought were correct, but they were expecting and wanted. Russia is the only country with the balls to fight a ground war but NATO is not on best terms with them, either, among other things.<p>(An aside: While Silicon Valley&#x27;s techno-optimism is perhaps one of the most productive, proactive and pragmatic stances one can take to the world&#x27;s flaws and inefficiencies, I try to remember that it&#x27;s probably an exception rather than the rule.

Before I say what it is, I have to preface it by saying that there is a greater than zero chance that I am a natural shortsleeper, and not just a night owl.<p>That said, here&#x27;s what worked for me:<p>I accepted that mornings are a wash and are not going to be super productive either way. So I stopped trying to wake up early, and instead wake up at 9am or as late as 9:30am.<p>I killed my commute (more rent, but it&#x27;s worth it cause I don&#x27;t need a car). That means that even when I get up as late as 9:30am, I am in the office by 10:15am.<p>And I avoid all serious work at least until lunch time. Those two to three hours are where I pack code review, any meetings, everything that&#x27;s necessary work, but doesn&#x27;t require deep focus and a lot of brainpower.<p>This is also when I load up on caffeine. In those two hours I drink the equivalent of two energy drinks (CogniTea is my poison of choice because it&#x27;s high in caffeine, and low in crap).<p>Then in the afternoon is my focus time and I get about 5 hours of mostly uninterrupted time. Caffeine keeps being drunk, of course. Just less than in the morning.<p>At 6pm I leave and go to the gym. Going to the gym daily helps with making sure my body is tired. If I don&#x27;t tire out my body, then it&#x27;s almost impossible to get a good night of sleep. And I&#x27;m also very edgy and agitated all day.<p>So remember, make sure your body is tired.<p>After the gym I have my relax time, and I drink more caffeine at around 9pm. This might seem stupid, but there&#x27;s a good reason.<p>Drinking caffeine in the evening speeds me up and makes sure that at around 2am or 3am I will crash. I can get more work done (or whatever) between 10/11pm and 2/3am.<p>And then I am tired. Like really really tired. Hard to stay awake.<p>Which is perfect, because I can go to bed. And if both my mind and body were tired enough, I will fall asleep 3 minutes after my head hits the pillow.<p>And because I&#x27;m well tired, I sleep like a rock. Sleep tracking apps sometimes think I&#x27;m dead.<p>Because I got good focused sleep, I am rested and ready to go next morning at 9am.<p>Or as Arnold would say &quot;Sleep faster, I would recommend&quot;.<p>You might have noticed I only get 6 hours of sleep per night. Sometimes a bit less. That has historically been way enough for me. I don&#x27;t know why, maybe I&#x27;m a genetic freak, maybe I&#x27;m fooling myself, but it&#x27;s a pattern I&#x27;ve been able to keep with small variations for the past 10 years of my life.<p>The approach boils down to:<p><pre><code>  * sleep when tired\n  * focused work when rested\n  * fuzzy work when fuzzy</code></pre>",1447881113

It is built on the argtags macro (early in the file), which provides an abstraction similar to tagbody/go, but where the labels can take parameters, and GO passes parameters to labels. The parameters are just variable assignments, of course. If you (goto foo 1 2 3) and there is a (label foo x y z), it means that control passes to that label, and the variables x y z take on values 1 2 3.<p>deftail is for tail recursion among independent functions.  It is based on trampolines. The :other-tails keyword is used to declare which other functions participate. When the deftail function calls these others, those calls are assumed to be tail calls.  You can also use the tail-call function explicitly (as a replacement for funcall) to abandon execution up to the trampoline loop and call a given function.<p>tail-call is the heart of the trampoline. It first checks whether it is already dynamically enclosed in a trampoline, and if so, it just uses that one to do the tail call. Otherwise it establishes a new dynamic contour and enters into the trampoline loop.<p>Thus any of the tail functions can be entered as ordinary functions. Then when they tail out to their peers, they establish the trampoline context.",1447880775

10590729,comment,10573735,10590545,0,0,beloch,,,"Some genes exhibit pretty complex behaviour.  For example, the gene for sickle cell anemia manifests as sickle cell disease only when an individual is homozygous in that gene (i.e. They have inherited a copy of this gene from both parents).  Such individuals have a host of health problems, including being more susceptible to malaria.  However, individuals who are heterozygous (i.e. they inherited just one copy from one parent) for the sickle cell gene do not typically have sickle cell disease, and being heterozygous in this gene actually confers resistance to malaria.  In areas where malaria is a major cause of death, the gene for sickle cell anemia is much more common than it is elsewhere.",1447880535

Django, and the other 15 packages we require, all support Python 3. In fact, I&#x27;ve been using Python 3 since 2008, and I&#x27;ve been using it for work since 2013. I think we&#x27;re past all of that, at this point.<p>I&#x27;m not sure why migration is always regarded as a metric for succes. Python 3 wasn&#x27;t supposed to be a &quot;upgrade&quot;, per se. It was supposed to allow the core to rid itself of a lot of the language&#x27;s warts. It has done this quite well without sacrificing much. The result was a slow migration, not by existing code bases, but by means of new companies.",1447880498

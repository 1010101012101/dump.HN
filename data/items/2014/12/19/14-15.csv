They will still be poor, and a part of the workforce that has existed from the beginning will be gone.  That part of the workforce has an effect on keeping goods and services at a lower price.  Raising the cost of labor and getting rid of those &quot;I just need some spending money jobs&quot; results in companies looking to replace the higher cost workers or raise prices.  Neither of these things benefit poor people.<p>&quot;We&#x27;re suggesting to pay poor people to not be poor.&quot;<p>I&#x27;m suggesting that the best bet for poor people is to provide a path to training that allows them to have jobs that are higher value to employers.  Making low value jobs cost more doesn&#x27;t help.  It hurts as these people don&#x27;t have high value skills and you are removing spending money from others that could be in the workforce.",1419001182

8772436,comment,8771795,8772370,0,0,kibwen,,,"In ancient Rust, the standard library attempted to provide an abstraction over the underlying threading model. The purpose of this abstraction, called a &quot;task&quot;, was to allow libraries to make use of the standard concurrency constructs while allowing the <i>consumers</i> of those libraries to determine whether or not to use 1:1 threading (the typical platform thread model) or M:N threading (green threads), and it would all Just Work with no effort required.<p>This was quite an exciting idea at the time. However, in practice, it just didn&#x27;t pan out: the compromises required to paper over the differences between 1:1 threading and M:N threading managed to almost entirely obliterate the respective advantages of both models.<p>As a result, Rust is in the process of removing the &quot;tasks&quot; abstraction and replacing it with a bog-standard 1:1 threading model (though it still benefits from all the typical memory-safe and concurrency-safe abstractions that Rust otherwise provides). All users of concurrency in the stdlib will now be using native threads, and it will be left to outside implementors to experiment with green threading libraries (see <a href=""https://github.com/carllerche/mio"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/carllerche/mio</a> for one example of such).<p>One of the consequences of this change is that the `std::task` module has been replaced with `std::thread`. Formerly, every Rust program imported the function `std::task::spawn` to use for spawning tasks. With the removal of `std::task`, the newly analogous function from `std::thread` has not been added to the prelude, and is therefore not imported by default in every Rust program. It could be added if such a thing were desired (you can see remarks to this effect in the comments on the PR itself (<a href=""https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/19654#issuecomment-66239082"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/19654#issuecomment-66...</a> and <a href=""https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/19654#issuecomment-66956364"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/19654#issuecomment-66...</a> )).",1419001042

8772425,comment,8771875,8771875,0,0,hyperliner,,,"The problem I have with this article is that it fails to recognize that language also is an anchor in a <i>negative</i> way. Yes, Hebrew can help form a stronger Jewish community, but a language spoken by 3000 people in the middle of the Amazon can only serve to keep those people hostage forever. What is wrong with teaching those people&#x27;s kids to speak Hebrew or Spanish or English and let them join a broader, stronger community or nation? The alternative is that those people&#x27;s children will not be able to prosper because, to highlight the obvious, many of these obscure languages are correlated with impoverished environments. Yes, it helps some academic in some fancy University in the northeast of the United States have &quot;intellectual debates&quot; about the issue while sipping on a starbucks latte, but it certainly does not help those people.<p>The second point is that the nuances that the author has observed don&#x27;t have to be lost.

But I bet I&#x27;ll feel differently in a decade.</i><p>I found that writing in college, for classes, was not fun. It was boring, there was a lot of &quot;write about this thing&quot; that I really didn&#x27;t know all that well. Further the topics weren&#x27;t something that interested me deeply. Even worse, on the rare occasions that I did get to choose really interesting topics, the situation was depressing, I just didn&#x27;t know enough to be able to make a good argument, didn&#x27;t have enough perspective to understand how to find the structure of the problem and argument, and didn&#x27;t really nave the background to position my statements. It was an exercise in just noting what other sources said, and putting lots of footnotes - extremely dry crap.<p>However, 5-6 years after college, I found myself working with a research group at a university (as a staff support programmer), and I did get to spend all my time figuring things out, coding and generally doing cool stuff (basically your 60hrs/week programming).  When the time came to make a final report on my first research project, and write up an academic paper about it, was annoyed at having to do another paper. It turned out that academic papers tend to have page counts too, and I&#x27;d need to be even more careful about footnoting ideas etc.<p>Something surprising happened with that though - the page count turned out to be a big problem, but in a completely unexpected way: I had to cut and rewrite several times, just to make solid statement and argument small enough to fit in 8 pages!  Amazingly I had gone from &quot;how do I fill 8 pages?&quot; to &quot;crap, I only have 8 pages to say this!&quot;.<p>I think the big difference was the depth of knowledge I had, combined with my genuine interest to describe work I found interesting and satisfying.  The college writing course taught me how to footnote, how to present an argument, how to build a reasonable conclusion, but had missed the part about writing being fun when one knows the material well. I went on to also enjoy some other types of writing - grants (convincing someone you have a good idea and getting them to fund it) and position papers (aka white papers, on ideas that our group thought would be good directions for further research.<p>I&#x27;m mentioning this because even if you don&#x27;t like the writing now, I&#x27;d suggest not letting it poison your future views of it - the experience can be rewarding under the right circumstances.

It was sirtuins for a while and then rapamycin and there will be others in due course. This happens because it is very possible to raise funding, start a company, and make a lot of money from this sort of thing even if - as is always the case to date - nothing of significance ever comes of it in terms of treatments that can actually extend life. As I&#x27;ve said in the past, this all seems like a really great cover story for the real scientific goal of amassing detailed data on the operation of cellular metabolism. The stated goals of slowing aging serve to draw in investment that would otherwise be hard to find at the needed levels: metabolism is ferociously complex, and trying to map it is chewing up billions of dollars. This is work that should be done, and the faster the better, but I think it disingenuous to talk of any real possibility that significant human life extension can result from it in the next few decades.<p>For real progress in treating aging an entirely different direction in scientific strategy is needed. Not mining the natural world for drug candidates that might slow down aging in poorly understood ways by altering poorly understood metabolic mechanisms, but rather deliberately aimed efforts to repair the known and comparatively well understood forms of damage that cause aging. We can bypass the need for a full and detailed understanding of how this damage interacts with every part of our metabolism to cause aging by taking the well validated and time-proven list of fundamental differences between old tissue and young tissue - a list of forms of cellular and molecular damage - and then repairing those differences. There is even a detailed set of research plans leading to treatments that can achieve this goal, which is a very large departure from the world of slowing aging through metabolic manipulation, where there is no plan to speak of and nowhere near enough knowledge to create one.<p>This is not even to mention the fact that slowing down damage accumulation can never be as good as repairing damage in terms of benefits delivered, and slowing further damage can do very little for old people who are already very damaged. The old need repair, and repair as a strategy is simply better overall in any case. It continues to amaze me that the clearly far worse, far more expensive, far less understood approach to treating aging is the one that dominates in this small research community.<p>In any case, every time a new overhyped drug candidate to slow aging emerges people get excited about it. Short memories, if you ask me. But the next time that someone you know in the community becomes fired up about early stage development of an age-slowing drug candidate that extends life in animal studies you can offer some needed perspective by saying &quot;but so does ibuprofen.&quot; And what does ibuprofen do for life span in humans? Nothing meaningful enough to show up in five decades of trials, studies, and worldwide usage.<p>The goal of taking decades and billions to add just a few years to adult life expectancy doesn&#x27;t fill me with glee. If that much time and money are to be expended, and I am to become old waiting, I want far better expected outcomes for success: decades of healthy life and rejuvenation, not pills to very slightly slow down the remaining decline. Fund research into repair biotechnologies after the SENS model, not the same old drug development programs that gave us a better knowledge of sirtuins and little else.",1418999609

If you options are 400$/month and 40 hour weeks or 600$ a month and 60 hour weeks a lot of people are going to chose the second option.  IMO, when it comes to exploitation pay, working conditions, and irregular work schedules can be far more exploitive than simple hours worked.<p>Also, dorm style housing next to a factory dramatically cut down on commute times which changes the work life balance equation.  It&#x27;s much like a 50 hour work week with a 1 hour commute which is fairly common in the US.<p>PS: IMO the US trucking industry is probably more expletive than most Chinese factory&#x27;s.

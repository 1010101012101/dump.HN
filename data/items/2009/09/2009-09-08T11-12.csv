There are already about 10,000 spammy 'social media gurus' to every 1 real twitter user.<p>I'm yet to see any compelling evidence that this has any effect on anything except the signal to noise ratio of what is already a very noisy space.<p>Interaction of individuals with businesses in social networking sites tends to fall under the category of 'brand loyalty', as in, people <i>already like</i> the brand, and therefore are willing to publicly associate themselves with it.  If you already have that kind of brand loyalty, then you don't need 'social media' as a marketing tool - your customers will probably do it for you with very little encouragement.<p>I think the real business opportunity of sites like Twitter and Facebook is becoming a self-styled 'social marketing' guru and then following 10 million people.

For example, if a house is worth $2M to the seller and $3M to the buyer, there's $1M potential surplus to be captured. A deal at $2.5M makes that makes that surplus real, in effect giving $500K to each. If a potential deal doesn't create net value - if the buyer doesn't receive enough benefit from the good, or the seller spends too much manufacturing it - the total wealth in the economy goes down as a result, even though the buyer OR the seller might win personally.<p><i>Serendipity happens.</i><p>Yes, and statistics can tell us what credence to assign to the chance of it happening. I certainly see no reason to assign 50% or similar credence to serendipity in the described case, or indeed any credence high enough to dominate the certain loss of value. Do you?",1252410713

 * American politics has a large bearing on my life. America's decisions about finance, foreign policy, fuel, war etc. affect us all. So it's nice to see that the current President is able to eloquently deliver a speech, and it's reassuring to think that he has the talents to be able to speak sensibly and convincingly in tense negotiations with a hypothetocal enraged Iranian President.
 * Presumably most of the start-up type people here are going to be doing some selling at some point - there's a lot to be learned from speeches of this quality.<p>Would I like to see random speeches from the Ukrainian President on here?

Neither are they free nor is it desirable to return to some kind of soviet state capitalism (it was only called communism but the means of production never were it the hands of the workers which is the prerequisite of communism).<p>Nowadays the market is not free at all, it's ruled by a few oligopolies in most industries. You must be blind not to acknowledge that. The creation of corporations was the last nail in the coffin of the free market.<p>A market can only be free where all people can take part in it and not only a few decide who gets the money. Btw.: The abolitionists attempted to abolish wage slavery as well but it's still prevalent.<p>It's also absurd to sever the economics from the business and startups part. Also web programming in open source projects is just pure communism. So just saying we don't talk about economics here is like talking about cars without ever mentioning the engines.<p>Like with cars we have to rethink the way we build engines. With cars it's the hybrid/electric model, with capitalism it's something else. We just can't go on like that. The economy break down has just been postponed. It will happen sooner or later.<p>Ignoring or censoring that fact won't make it disappear.<p>To be honest: The current set up of startups begging a few VCs for money is neither sustainable nor does it make much sense. Just look at most startups. Either they disappear, they get swallowed and more or less left to rot or the VCs fire the founders. Or of course they go bankrupt. Is this what people are working for? I doubt that.<p>I guess sooner or later crowdfunding will take over and VCs will disappear. Maybe sooner than later as the financial system can finally break down any day.",1252410374

810718,comment,810484,810700,0,0,jacquesm,,,"The goals of sales people and producers are generally not aligned with the goals of consumers. In an ideal world all consumption would be 'pull'.<p>Consumers would be informed about the available products in a neutral way, would know about the ins and outs of all the products they could choose from and would have an idea of the long-term benefits of the products if purchased.<p>Clearly, we do not live in an ideal world.<p>Most consumption of 'primary needs goods' is still on 'pull' basis, at least it is in most parts of the world.<p>But even there advertising is shaping consumers decisions more and more. Branding and marketing are gaining a bigger foothold than ever before even when it comes to buying everyday needs items such as drinking water, bread, rice, clothing and so on.<p>For other goods 'regular consumption goods and luxury goods' the situation is even more extreme.<p>> That's circular. How do you define what objectively benefits someone?<p>It's not circular, it is recursive ;)<p>But the recursion bottoms out where you run out of funds to buy something that you really need. Most income spent on useless stuff (for instance to feed addictions) goes at the expense of a real need (for instance to feed or clothe children). By having individuals compete with companies that have meanwhile spent upwards of a century honing their skills we are creating a completely uneven battle.<p>Nobody is able to make their decisions about what they need with any degree of impartiality.<p>The best way to describe 'to benefit someone' is to say that their lives have a maximized sense of happiness.<p>So all other things being equal, if you buy the 'wrong' car because a salesman pushed it down your throat somehow then your happiness will not be as high as it would have been had you gone through with what would have been the most rational decision.<p>If you look for a definition of what is in the common best interest I would suggest you look everywhere <i>but</i> to your government, almost by definition it does not have the common best interest at heart. In theory it does, in practice I don't think there is a single government on earth that would be able to make that claim and withstand an investigation into the veracity of that claim.<p>Maybe I'm old and cynical, but where ever I've lived I did not have the feeling the government had my interests in general at heart.",1252410258
810717,comment,810192,810654,0,0,miked,,,"<i>Japan engaged in quantitative easing for a decade and never had inflation.</i><p>Correct. Instead they had the ""Lost Decade"" of economic stagnation, as it is known there (and here). It's actually been much longer than a decade now (it started in the early nineties). A few weeks ago it cost the governing party, which has been in power for 53 of the last 54 years, control of the government.<p>Money follows the law of supply and demand as much as anything else. When the supply of it (relative to the supply of goods and services) goes up, the price (value) of it goes down: inflation. So one of two things has to happen: either the Fed lets that money stay in circulation, triggering a boom in the short term followed by inflation in the long term, or they start sopping it up and ""burning"" it, which will trigger a downturn.<p>Think about it this way: if all we had to do was to trun on the printing presses to make economic magic happen, why wouldn't we do it all the time? Inflation is the worst form of taxation, because it causes such massive economic distortion, as we've recently seen in the housing market. The Fed pumped up the money supply and people watched their home's valuation go up 10% or more a year. They then made bad economic decisions based on the false idea that it was real. And now we have the current mess.",1252410223

I don't see that in Russell's piece, nor in the attitude of other later people who dislike advertising. (Nor, in case this is what you mean, does it look to me as if Russell thinks that he himself has especially strong ""sales resistance"" or that he should be admired for it if so.

K thanks.""<p>Most basic marketing courses in college lay the foundation to ""convince kids/parents to buy just about anything, whether they need it or not, whether they previously wanted it or not?"". McDonald's does it because they have the pockets to do so - Old Poppa Joe's deli across the street would do so too if they could, and you can be assured they wouldn't warn you of the health hazards.<p>There's little to no point in bad-mouthing the sellers - that's precisely their business.

810679,comment,809890,809957,0,0,gjm11,,,"Very clever. But I'm not convinced: anything that increases the theft rate and thereby requires people to buy more also increases the effective cost of the product. I don't have any numbers on this, so you should be skeptical about what follows, but: introspection strongly suggests to me that when the price of a thing increases by a given factor, my probability of buying it goes down by a <i>larger</i> factor. (At least when we're talking phones, toys, music players, cameras, computers, etc.) Now, suppose you try to increase sales by encouraging theft: if a fraction f of devices are stolen and their owners buy replacements, then (1) the effective cost goes up by a factor of about 1+f and (2) the number of sales per ""original"" sale is about 1+f. If my introspection happens to describe how typical people behave, then the net result is that the vendor sells <i>fewer</i> devices. (And has less happy customers.)<p>(Actually it's 1/(1-f), not 1+f, if your second iWidget is just as likely to be stolen as your first. Something in between if you are more careful to avoid theft once you've been bitten once.)",1252408347

But Russels depiction of this hard-working professional as a victim is condescending. He can provide for his family, but can't in the face of a simple salesman say ""no, go away, and if you come back next week I won't be this polite""? This is obviously a contrived example, because the real world don't lend itself well to the point he wants to make.<p>> the goal of (many) salespeople and advertisers is to make their targets sillier and stupider, and that's seldom in their interests or those of the community / nation / world as a whole.<p>Obviously there are scammers out there, but the average advertisement/sale caters to the average consumer, and by declaring that the actions of these consumers make them ""sillier and stupider"" (than what?) and that they don't act in their own interest or ""those of the community / nation / world as a whole"" <i>is</i> ""holier-than-thou"".<p>How do you objectively define the best interest of the ""community / nation / world as a whole""? To take a very current example, the current financial crisis is caused in (a large) part by the political system (a democratic president and a republican house -- no-one gets away clean) deciding that is was in the best interest of the nation and its citizens is to lend a lot of money to a lot of people who couldn't really afford it to buy their own home.",1252408015

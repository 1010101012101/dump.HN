Of course, there was other payment options but I used the card option so that I could use that later for online purchasing, etc. I don't think that should convince you to not sign up IMHO.",1202697803

113188,comment,113079,113169,0,0,mechanical_fish,,,"Well, a big part of the problem is Metcalfe's Law, of course. But let's think about this:<p><i>How hard is it to offer a couple of decent looking templates for people to make their own site, to that it isn't such an eyesore?</i><p>That's not a bug, it's a feature.<p>I and others have speculated at length about why being an eyesore is a potential <i>advantage</i> for a site that invites the general public to contribute -- people are happier to design their own pages if they aren't being scored against a high standard. Moreover, for an eBay seller, being downscale is a potential marketing advantage. Ask yourself: who seems more likely to give you an amazing deal on the rare antique watch that you're looking for: a random guy who found it in his late father's basement, knows nothing about watches, and is nearly illiterate? Or a professional used-watch retailer with a slickly designed website?<p>It's telling that one of eBay's biggest competitors is Craigslist, which has <i>far less</i> visual design.<p><i>How hard is it to implement a better form of search and categorization?</i><p>Pretty hard, I'd wager. What is your problem with eBay's search? I always thought it worked pretty well. Do you have some specific use cases to complain about?<p>Designing categorization systems is hard, very hard. Go Google up ""taxonomy vs folksonomy"" and you'll find guys like Clay Shirky complaining about it.<p><i>How hard is it to develop a form of authentication to cut down on all the fraud that takes place on Ebay?</i><p>Isn't it easy? If you're a buyer, require an escrow service and a money-back guarantee, and bid low enough that you offset the potential cost of return shipping and handling. If you're a seller, require payment in advance and either sell ""as is"" or make the buyer bear the cost of return shipping.<p>Of course, the added friction is going to cost you money, time, options, and bidder attention, so most eBay customers are nowhere near as paranoid as this. I conclude that these people are <i>happily choosing</i> the risk of being defrauded in the hope of saving a couple bucks.<p>The general problem with building a less-fraud-prone version of eBay is that we already have things like that: they're called ""retail stores"" and ""pawnshops"" and ""used-equipment dealers"". You can compete with these guys, just as you can imagine competing with eBay, but they <i>are</i> veterans who know how to operate within thin margins, so don't expect it to be trivially easy.<p>eBay buried a lot of competitors in the first dotcom boom.",1202697468

There are always 1000 details you have to get right.<p>I'm suspicious of projects described by appending that word ""out"" after ""build.""  It implies the speaker is underestimating the importance of execution.  In the best projects, execution is not merely important, but even flows back into design.",1202696392

But the trends might change (and that's the interesting part about following how social ads fare nowadays).<p>Provided there are incentives for people in social networks to list the commodities they own, it would be rather nice, when you're about to buy a commodity, to get (on-demand) feedback from friends that already have this type of commodity (as opposed to the feedback from the whole community). Example: how to choose among the 5 different types of GPS'es? If a friend tells you that model A works flawlessly, you might just stop cross-analysing all available models on the market and just buy model A (via a sponsored link, next to the area where you exchange feedback in your social network).<p>The whole web 2.0 trend with user-generated content is nice, but it's limited because one does not trust anyone equally. You need personalization (a trend in web 3.0) and/or small communities (where people can relate to each other easily, and not ""to the whole world""). Hacker News is an example of the latter, where I'd say the users are much more homogeneous than those on Reddit (and that's probably the main reason why people migrated from Reddit to Hacker News).<p>All in all, I do see potential for social ads, but in an improved form of what we have today.",1202695827

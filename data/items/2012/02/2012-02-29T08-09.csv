And, I was surprised how many people actually diligently replied to my email, and spent a lot of time offering suggestions etc.<p>A few things I learned in the process:<p>* Making the email as short and as highly targeted as possible made a difference (anecdotal, not measured)<p>* When somebody replied saying that they will look into it in a day or so, I did not immediately reply back saying ""Thank you"" etc. Instead I waited for a day or two and then replied. The second email actually served as a gentle reminder and I got a response immediately after that.<p>* In many cases, I specifically looked for people looking at a specific problem which what I was building helped to alleviate. This naturally increased the response rates.<p>* Lastly, people are generally wary of people selling things. So, I suggest genuinely trying to seek people's insights and guidance rather than directly sell them your idea. If people liked your idea, they themselves will go out of their way to do that.<p>And for what it's worth, I am going to shamelessly use this opportunity to offer the same: if you are looking for design related feedback on what you are building, say hello (email in profile!)",1330505953

I could hand you eCash in an offline way, from my device to yours, as if I was handing you a bill, without going through a bank/clearing house network to authorize and validate the transfer.<p>But the issuance of eCash was still done by the bank. This is what makes eCash not 100% decentralized... I would compare eCash to the ""pseudo p2p"" Napster file sharing network which still relied on a central server (gasp!) to index the files, which allowed authorities to shut down the ""p2p"" network by closing down that central server.",1330505883

Not freelance, but really a fulltime remote job with all benefits without coming into the office more than twice / year or something. No matter how brilliant you are. I think that's a big miss for employers; because they want to have the sense of 'control', they want all people present. Sure in some cases it helps to have the team sitting in one place, but in my experience remote employees are far more productive (as they have something to prove) and work harder than on-premise.<p>Sorry; offtopic, just a pet-peeve with 'modern employers' :)",1330505479

3647093,comment,3646715,3646715,1,0,corysama,,,"The audience for games has expanded out of the computer club and into all walks of life.  By some estimates, the number of people playing some sort of video game has tripled in the past five years.  As it happens, different people like different kinds of games.<p>The classical male introvert gamer really enjoys difficult challenges that require focus and mastery to overcome.  But, today there is a new, additional audience that enjoys a simple pleasure of directed progress much more than the thrill of defeating great threats.  There is also a new audience of part-time gamers who play in very short spurts, but can't devote the extended, continuous blocks of time required to mentally log the details of complicated situations (required to recover from being lost).<p>The classic audience is still here.  And, after a lifetime of nearly all games being focused on a fairly uniform audience, some classical gamers are having a hard time adjusting to the huge influx of new games that are explicitly not targeting them for the first time.<p>But, the old-skool games, full of challenges to overcome, are still around if you are still interested.  If you want a game that cruelly beats you down until you finally get good enough to genuinely beat it back, try Dark Souls.  If want a game where no matter how smart you are, there is always a smarter way to do it, try SpaceChem.  If you want a strange and dangerous new world to trip you up, try Zeno Clash.  If you want some sarcastic fun with friends, try Magicka.  If you want to compete at any level from pants-on-head to world-champion, try StarCraft II.  If you want a game where you make incredible things come to be, but there are no graphics to speak of, try Dwarf Fortress.

I mean, what's wrong with being short?<p>The point that ""politically correct"" people are missing is that you cannot really make someone ""feel bad"", because they already feel bad.

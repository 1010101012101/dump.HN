Occasionally true.  But there are <i>many fewer of them</i> than there are of blocks or buildings.  Streets are long.

966531,comment,966171,966171,0,0,rfreytag,,,"My company (Freytag & Company, LLC), won a DARPA Phase I and Phase II STTR (just like a SBIR but 30% goes to a US univesity).  Phase I was for <$100K/1 year (at least 30% to a U.S. university so its $70K which has to in fact last you 18-24 months IF you win Phase II - YC-like if you ask me) and Phase II was competed with second-contract award a year after Phase I ended for < $750K/2 years (again 30% to university).<p>Topic DARPA ST061-004: ttp://tinyurl.com/yzuqxwh<p>This was our fourth SBIR/STTR proposal and only win.  SBIR/STTR topics are very competitive (winning teaches you how so you are more likely to win again).  This particular topic received ~30 submissions of which an unusually high number were awarded (3) Phase I money.  Winning Phase I does not mean you win Phase II because of poor results or no Federal funds available.  For this topic we also had two competitors for Phase II funding.  You cannot win Phase II without first winning the Phase I.<p>The marketing, regulatory, and compliance process that comes with this money has been VC-pitching-intense but the advantages and cautions are very, very different.  One advantage is that the Federal government pays in a recession.  The catches are important and I found surprising (e.g it is non-trivial to negotiate a contract with a U.S. university under a deadline and to do so while complying with the Bayh-Dole Act).  Also DoD SBIR/STTRs train you to become a government contractor (NSF might be different).  Selling commercially is unusual but laudable - just don't expect people to be very familiar with what you need in the way a VC is ""supposed"" to be.<p>As a result of this process, my company (Freytag & Company, LLC), has products, enough money for one other employee, and huge experience going to the government market.<p>Since, our Phase II contract was ""cost plus fixed fee"" (most bigger government contracts are), and most costs are labor hours, regulatory compliance means tracking labor hours with contract codes.  We passed our first Defense Contract Audit Agency (DCAA) audit just before we won our Phase II and are about to undergo another audit less than two years later.  As a result we have probably one of the tightest accounting systems for a company this size you will ever see (and a damn fine accountant).<p>Because we took a lot of money and are doing something that might fail despite the money, we (well, -I-) decided to give our time-tracking tool away free.  Figured it was a certain way to: 1. help the SBIR/STTR program grow our economy by 2. helping other firms immediately solve one part of their compliance problem - that of being able to track employee and contractor hours in the particular way the government expects.<p>If you need to track your labor hours over a distributed team of developers and would like to use a tool that has taken at least one firm through a government audit (and soon another - joy!) email me at timesheets@freytag.us.

What do you have against Canucks?<p>I don't have anything against Canadians — in fact, I am one. I do have something against sales tax. Dealing with federal and provincial sales taxes would not only mean dealing with extra paperwork; it would also mean figuring out whether the government considers me to be selling software (the tarsnap client code), providing a service within Canada (since I'm resident here), or providing a service outside of Canada (since the tarsnap service is provided via hardware in the US) -- not to mention questions like whether tarsnap is ""data warehousing"", ""data processing"", ""telecommunications"", or something else entirely. How tarsnap is classified would determine if I'd have to charge sales tax, how much, and to whom — and I'm guessing that those answers are different between federal and provincial taxes, too. From what I've read about sales taxes I'm reasonably confident about one thing, however: I don't need to charge sales tax to non-Canadians.<p>So for the moment, I'm taking the path of least resistance: Don't allow Canadians to use tarsnap, and spend my time writing code instead of trying to figure out how complicated sales tax laws, which were written by people who never imagined the internet or online services, apply to tarsnap.",1259516156

In fact, it was only noteworthy because it was a meta-scandal that lived inside the far bigger one of the firing of US attorneys, a story that was basically set ablaze not by the media but by the moronic testimony of Alberto Gonzales and Monica Goodling before congress.  And it was never wrapped-up or followed-up on beyond diggings from the progressive blogosphere because after AGAG was hung out of dry the media deemed its job complete.<p>Anyway, your comparison is apples and oranges.  Political scandals will always carry more weight in the public eye than science ones, if for no other reason than the fact that their hands are directly on the levers of power, whereas scientists just use a (relatively) small amount of taxpayer money compared to what is doled out in the halls of political power.

In the eyes of your editor's boss, the VP (Marketing), you have blown it if your first book doesn't break even on P&E. Break-even comes some time before you earn out the advance, but even so: if you don't break even on your first contract they'll drop you like a hot potato. <i>Especially</i> if someone gambled $1.5M of the corporate turnover on you and lost!<p>Assuming an average royalty rate of 10% -- it varies from 6% up to 15% in commercial fiction, depending on print run, format, phase of the moon, elevator clauses, and so on, but 10% is about right for a big hardcover run followed by a metric buttload of paperbacks -- then you can multiply the author's advance by ten to get a handle on the amount of turnover the publisher was betting on her. Which in her case was on the order of a million dollars.<p>Her final tally: 10K hardcovers and paperbacks sold. Even if those 10K sales were 100% hardcover at undiscounted list, they didn't turn over $0.24M (and more likely they broke down into something like 2500 hc and 7500 mmpb, in which case total turnover for the book was more like $100K). Actual <i>profits</i> for the publisher are typically about the same as the author's advance (a lot of money goes into the pockets of the distributors and retailers). So they were looking to make about $150K in profit, and instead made $10K and lost $150K on the advance (not to mention another $100K on the unsold copies they pulped).<p>If they'd given her a $10K advance they might have patted her on the head and said ""there there, dear, let's try again, shall we?"" But you don't get a second chance if you lose big right off the block. The usual response is to bury it deep (before someone higher up notices the oopsie and fires the responsible party).<p>In today's publishing industry, you're only ever as good as your last book.

Most people can't keep up their ""interview face"" for very long.  It's tiring.  At some point, if you put them at ease, they will revert to their normal self.  That is when you'll get to see what they're really like.  I've seen some pretty amazing transformations when waiting for this second phase of the interview.",1259514985

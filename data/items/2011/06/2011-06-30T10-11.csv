Regardless, the overhead of people bringing you up to speed on their specific projects and processes for only three months of work just doesn't match what you are going to contribute.  The cold hard fact is that you are still junior, very junior, no matter how much a hotshot you think you are.  So the time they put into you makes it a pretty even trade for it not to be paid.<p>Though come to think of it, both internships I went to were paid.  But the point stands.<p>To put it simpler terms, ask any company whether they find new college graduates effective and worth the overhead for the first few months they work.  I doubt many would say yes, and those are people more qualified than those seeking internships.",1309431311

Uhh, sure, yes, you get the milk from that, I don't know if I'd define ""interesting"" that way.<p>As for his actual argument.  Depends on the application.  If you run 20 lines of code, no loops, for 2mil clients on one server, that 20 lines matters.  If that 20 lines includes one line which requires a lock, maybe only that one line matters.  Maybe I analyze a graph structure (oh, the social web) and my loop is a loop per say not not anything that can be easily optimized without knowing the topology.  The slow part of your loop can be the loop body.  Or not --- it can be the allocation/deallocation cost of data structures.  Parallelism can be fast --- or the concurrency weight can be crushing.

2713406,comment,2711231,2711598,1,0,yardie,,,"1. But how does that explain that Direct3D came out in Windows NT first? From what I remember the NT version was more advanced version released at that point (DX5 to  95's DX3) and they even managed to pack in a few games that took advantage of it (Pinball stands out). By my accounts it looked like Microsoft was using NT to position Direct3d with poor OGL thrown in for those too stubborn to move.<p>2. I think it's a bit more nuanced than that. OGL was a bear to program for. Microsoft wrote an easier API but it didn't get good until much later. If anything the OGL group should have seen this coming and done something about it. Instead they chose to ignore it at their own peril. Those other OSes were effectively dead by this point MS didn't need to move developers anywhere they were already captured.<p>3. Agreed. Even now there is no API like it except SDL, and even SDL is very very limited.<p>4. Agreed.<p>OpenGL collapsed due to a lot of things. The primary reason was the group itself.

At best, you'll get a personal loan secured by you personally.  The rates on personal loans are terrible (in some cases approaching credit card cash advance interest rates, though you can do better if you have great credit and/or shop around and find a bank that likes you) and, even if the business folds, you remain liable for it.<p>Investing is another kettle of fish.  My main con there would be a) it takes a lot of time and b) there are fundable businesses and unfundable businesses, and if I had to guess, you're unfundable.  There's nothing wrong with that: I sell software to schools, teachers, and homeschool parents, and my business is not just unfundable, it's <i>laughably</i> unfundable.<p>Have you considered bootstrapping?

Nowadays nearly every magazine only has glowing reviews and no negative ones. Editors tell writers that bad reviews will result in lost advertising revenue since publishers/manufacturers threaten to stop advertising in magazines with bad reviews of their products. Contrary to this I have many reviews that rip apart products and point out their numerous defects. I also have reviews that praise good products.

The default action of users seems to be to make things public. I don't think this is a user issue, because users don't really decide anything about it. They just do it. So it's a Circles design issue. They should <i>just do it</i> by using Circles, not by broadcasting to everyone.<p>Google, I strongly believe this is VITAL for Google+'s success not only in the mid-term (i.e. beating Facebook), but long term as well (not becoming messy like Facebook, even after it kills it). The Circles idea was the RIGHT IDEA. Now just make sure people actually use it as intended and as promised. Otherwise it's just a useless bullet point in Google+'s feature list.<p>Get it right, Google, before the service becomes public!",1309428127

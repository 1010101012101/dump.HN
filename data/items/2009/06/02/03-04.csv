Many private company owners have this level of wealth, and many wouldn't desire a higher level of success.  I guess if you want 'have my own jet' levels of wealth, sooner or later you'll need someone else's money to help, even if it is just to secure their contacts/expertise.

Candle flame eddies, swirling winds?  What bunkum.  Weather is what you get?  So what we get in 50 years, as predicted by climate forecasts, won't be weather?<p>The reason people argue that climate predictions are weak because of the inability of massive amounts of computing power and continually revised models still fail to predict short term temperature and conditions.  This is with a lot of known inputs.  And yet, we are all supposed to believe the outputs of a 100 year climate prediction, when the amount of assumed/fudged/unknown variables is simply immense?  This is the core reason people (including myself) place no credence whatsoever in climate modelling.  I'm happy to change my mind when someone can prove they know all or enough of the inputs to make the model highly accurate.  What would be the effect of another 10 hurricanes per year?  What about a reversal or diversion of the Gulf stream?  How about a permanent el nina in the Pacific?

There's just no good way to make money at it.<p>First, it's damnably hard to get people to pay you for anything software based.  With the rampant piracy, nobody has ever needed to pay a dime for anything.  Convincing people to BUY software is virtually impossible.  Even if you could convince people to pay, the payment systems are byzantine at best.  Forget credit cards, you'd better be prepared to go collect cash from people at home or work.<p>Advertising-based models MIGHT work, but the competition's going to be tough.  You'll be competing with corporations like Google, Microsoft, YouKu, and others that have billions to burn while they build marketshare.  However you might succeed.  Games like WOW can also make money.<p>Regardless, if you start making any money, it will probably be taken from you.  The government already has its fingers in your pie, because you <i>must</i> get licensed from the government to run a website.  That means dealing with government officials who will demand kickbacks, or might just up and seize your business.  The same goes for any partners that you have, who will inevitably try to squeeze you out and take over any profit-making venture.  The odds of you having your business simply taken from you are very very high.<p>Naturally, you have absolutely no legal protection for anything.  Zero.  If anything, the courts are your enemy, because they side with whoever has the most influence and that's not you.  Your employees embezzle from you?  Your competitor (or a partner) steals all of your equipment?  Government officials demand ""protection"" money?  Too bad!  Better luck next time.  You can also forget about patent, trademark or copyright protection, but that goes without saying.<p>I'm not even going to cover things like hiring engineers or building hardware here, which have their own special headaches.<p>It's not impossible to make money here, but 99% of the time the risk/reward ratio isn't worth it.  Personally, I'm basing my company in California and targeting the American market.  We might eventually come to Hong Kong or Taiwan, but I've written off the mainland as a lost cause.",1243912122

310807,comment,310538,310732,0,0,drewcrawford,,,"I hardly think it's fair to take someone's religious beliefs and infer their <i>intellect</i>.  Someone's beliefs about the unknowable (or lack thereof) doesn't have a causative effect on their intellect in any way I can determine.<p>Imagine the power a person would have as president: being able to call up the SEC chairman or the Fed chairman for an hour gives him more power than any entepreneur I know.  If Bush is a complete bumbling idiot, surely some enterprising entepreneur would have been able to outsmart him in an election.  Seeing as how that didn't happen, I'm forced to conclude he's at least slightly more intelligent than he appears.<p>Have you ever heard Tony Blair speak for any length of time?  Blair appears to share many of the same views as Bush, but tends to express them much more clearly.  I don't agree with Blair on many points, but the reason I disagree is not because Blair is an idiot; it's because he is working from a worldview / set of assumptions that I don't share.",1222055517

(That being said, it is very hard to do.)<p>Some have been able to pull together up to $1M or more in $50 to $100k chunks.<p>As Ivan mentions, VCs like USV, Charles River Ventures and Bay Partners also come to mind -- they can do $200-$500k seed deals in one shot, or syndicate with angels.<p>There does seem to be a step function in valuation though when you get to Series A -- but that's moreso because of the economics of the VC game. They want to put $x million in a Series A, and they want to leave enough on the table for the founders to keep working, so they work backwards from that to set a premoney valuation.",1222053757

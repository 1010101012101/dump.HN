<a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/comments?id=18973"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/comments?id=18973</a><p>You need to be careful in using the word ""intelligence,"" because it means different things to different people. Paul's post doesn't explicitly address this, but he doesn't need to. The point is the ""I can improve"" attitude can strongly influence your chances of success.<p>You are born not with a base level of ""intelligence."" You are born with natural tendencies to excel at certain domains. You can be an excellent mathematician but find poetry opaque. In that case your Chess analogy holds. Where the tendency isn't immediately obvious though, is where hard work is the determining factor. Some people never seem to hit plateaus, but for those who do, it's the effort that pushes you across it. This is very well investigated by KA Ericsson; it's called ""deliberate practice"" or something, and the theory is actually quite simple.<p>Also, brain connections are malleable after adulthood, albeit less dramatic than those of kids, but significant enough to turn an OCD patient into a normal person. Jeffrey Schwartz if you're interested.<p>man, i kinda miss reading this stuff.",1178368922

19747,comment,19670,19680,0,0,jward,,,"I'll second the call to Python.  There's a fairly large community around it, it has a lot of libraries to use in your code, the source is very easy to read both because of it's enforced formating rules and the clarity of the language itself, and on top of all that it's even useful.<p>My point against Ruby is that it has a lot of magic.  Python explicitly tries to remove magic and make everything clear.  Magic is nice once you grok it, but for learning I'd want things to be straight forward.",1178367736

19745,comment,19658,19706,0,0,jward,,,"The flaw in your reasoning is you present different areas and don't consider overlap.  The way you explain it, you make it sound like a hacker / coder is a beast more constrained by his class than a twelfth level paladin.<p>A successful startup will have members who individually fill many roles with diverse skillsets.  For a web startup I fully believe the most important factor is being able to take whatever vision you have and form it into reality.<p>If you don't understand the customer base you won't do so well.  If you can't build your product you won't do anything at all.",1178367493

1) verify your database and code support unicode
2) use the utf-8 charset for your pages instead of ISO-8859-1<p>:)

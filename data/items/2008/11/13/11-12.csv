In another section of RAM, keep a datastructure for each user, keeping track of bids, and the current number of bids for the auction and the current bid.<p>When a new bid comes in, first lookup the user's record, and check if the bid is legal, and then pass it on to compare with the current highest bid. This is your critical section. if the bid is higher than the current, update, otherwise reject.",1226576363

If I'm not mistaken this is a forum where people try to help each other and try to learn and understand new things.  If people don't care about this topic they certainly won't respond or even look at it, so I hardly see where I can be 'saturating the channel' as you claim I am.<p>Unfortunately it seems you would rather complain and find fault than to contribute something useful.  Your suggestion that I go somewhere else and pay someone with experience to 'deal with all this' won't work when I need to gain at least a general understanding of how all these issues relate to each other first!<p>It would be much nicer if you would stop trying to derail my attempts to learn something here, and just ""remain silent and observe"" if you don't have anything useful or constructive to offer.<p>But complaining about the way I've separated sub-topics by posting them separately in this thread, or about the way I've quoted comments from the previous thread so people don't have to go back and review then in the old thread any more ... well it just seems like you're trying to find fault with my efforts any way you can -- and it strikes me as precisely the <i>wrong</i> thing to do in a forum like HN, that's all.<p>:(",1226575614

I agree with the other commenters that you're probably a long way from this being a ""startup"" (at least in the post-Oct2008 world that would like to see some business model), but you are certainly doing some interesting things.<p>How you turn this into a business is another problem but I think you will probably see people picking up on the ideas here and rapidly creating their own innovations. That might seem like a bad thing, but I think it's good because it means you've come up with something very powerful.<p>Probably the most interesting thing to me is the subset / scripting language that makes interacting with various services and providing the backend infrastructure for performing that automation.<p>Good luck!",1226575466

""Hey, we could build this cool solution! Would that solve any problems?"" I've never managed to find a worthwhile business idea that way (not that I'm an expert at it or anything).. in my experience the way to do that is to find the problem first and then figure out what solution you could build (using your technology) to help solve that problem. Then figure out if there really is a market for that solution, and then build it incrementally and evolve it to serve that market. Then at one point flick the switch and start charging.",1226575291

362956,comment,362906,362942,0,0,cte,,,"As a developer, I can vouch for that :)<p>In fact, I ended up building this because I didn't want to pay for the other mobile services platforms (there are a few of them) when attempting to add mobile features to another project I'm experimenting with.<p>But to your original point, I absolutely agree, pitching this as a ""mobile"" ""platform"" for ""widgets"" is probably hopeless. Quite simply, it must solve somebody's problem. And I believe that we can get it to do just that. One area that we think is promising is using email to invoke applications that do interesting things because\n(1) everyone knows how to send email, and\n(2) you can attach lots of useful things to email.<p>So, what if we added the ability to recognize a ton of different file formats and allowed you to query the data within an attached file to invoke other web services?<p>For example, lets say you have a site that does group payments, and you want to let your users send you an Excel spreadsheet with the names of your friends and how much they owe you for that trip you just took together and automatically create an invoice on your site, and then notify everyone that they owe money. That seems interesting, and our product could support that pretty easily.<p>Anyways, it is definitely our immediate burden to focus this technology on solving _real_ problems.",1226574395

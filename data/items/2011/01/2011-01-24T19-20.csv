It isn't weird for the ACM to act this way; it's weird (or at least <i>new</i>) for people to want to work in a high-paying, technically specialized profession, not pay professional society dues, and still get all the benefits of a professional society.  Hey, if you bring us that utopia, more power to you, but I don't see anything broken about the current model from an adult's point of view.  Students and faculty get access through their university, and everyone else makes good enough money to pay ACM dues.  The weak point is kids, who are excluded by the current system (which was never meant to work for kids) unless they live near a university.",1295899166

I went in with the goal of trying not to piss them off and in the process turn them into a client/customer. Similar to what you're angling for from what I can tell by your comments.<p>So two tips:<p>- Make sure you're ready. I knew going in, just like you feel you do, that they would be open to my plan. A lot of the time leading up to giving my notice was spent making sure I was right. I quite literally spent three months getting the balls to jump ship and making sure I was pretty confident I would come out with a client.<p>- For the love of God, play it cool when you tell them. Try and remember that you're quitting a job and not making a sales call. I wouldn't lead with your plans until they ask. During our conversation about the transition, the chit-chat slowly worked towards what they should do when I was gone. That's when I threw out that they could hire someone else full-time or take me on as a contractor for the technically heavy work and dish out the rest to existing employees.<p>The only thing I find worrisome about your scenario is that you're apparently counting on them buying a product that doesn't appear to exist yet. They can say ""Sure, great idea!"" on the day you leave and then, months down the line when it's time to play ball they can act dumb and say ""No thanks, baby. That was just pillow talk.""<p>I feel like you might be putting the cart before the horse a bit here but I wish you the best of luck.",1295898635

Fixed work means fixed spec. Always. Any changes must be accompanied by a document (a change order) that spells out the impact to the bottom line, because that's what business managers care most about. The key is to make sure you clearly communicate the impact to the bottom line all the way up to the check signer.<p>* Never let a project get to 14 weeks without the check signer (not just your contact or stakeholders; the person who will sign the check) knowing that you're accruing billing. It doesn't matter how good your friend is, you don't want them in a position where they're having to act the odd-man-out in order for you to get paid.

When I watched Avatar the IMAX got upgraded so it was much better and because I was immersed in the movie I didn't mind, but low frame-rate was still noticeable.<p>Can movie directors finally decide to shoot movies in higher FPS or they are still afraid that higher frame-rate will make their move have VHS feel not cinema theater feel?",1295898220

2136434,comment,2135423,2135423,0,0,ylem,,,"I think the author of this piece misses a point.  Let me take the example of the American Physical Society (APS).  They have membership fees (required to go to their conferences) and journals which charge money for access.  As with all academic publishing, you sign a copyright waiver (but you are allowed to post your article on your own homepage--also, for many of us, we initially publish things on arxiv.org in preliminary form (before peer review).  So, you have two sources--the author if they choose to distribute it, and the arxiv for many papers (excepting breaking high profile papers that might appear in Science or Nature).   Overall, the APS is relatively good--they provide much cheaper access rates to poorer institutions domestically (USA) and internationally.<p>Now, you might wonder--what is the value added that publishers provide?  Governments pay for the research, government sponsored researchers do most of the initial typesetting/editing, and government sponsored researchers do the peer review.   The answer is that publishers:
1) Screen the papers to send out for peer review
--there is a lot of noise in submissions.  Is this paper interesting or not?  Does it pass the ""sniff"" test on technical correctness?  
To do this first pass requires editors with domain level knowledge of the field--they can skim the article if they are not experts and guess about impact/sniff/etc.  They are familiar with the reputations of researchers.  Essentially these are people with at least a PhD in the field and this is not cheap. 
2)  Again, the editors are acquainted with potential reviewers in the field.  They have amassed a database of people who are good reviewers.  For example, referee A always critical?  Is referee B always a softee?  Does referee C respond in a timely fashion?  Does referee D always have his reviews overturned on appeal to an additional referee? Etc.<p>So, essentially, what you are paying for is screening out signal to noise.  The first thing you might think of is, well, let the government step in.  I think this would be very bad.  Why?  Because it would then be easy for the government to determine what gets published and what doesn't.  Think climate change....<p>Next, you might think--ok, well what about open access?  Again, the problem is that many open access journals (where the authors pay and the public reads for free) is that the prices to authors steadily increases and unless it is mandated, authors may seek other journals.  Especially if the most prestigious journals are not open access....
Finally, you might ask, well, what about a technical solution?
Hacker News for academic publishing, complete with automated tracking of referees, calculations of reputations based on citations, commenting, etc.  But, then you'll bump into problems of avoiding winner take all and that for academic publishing, you want the comments and referee process to be deliberate and considered.<p>What I would suggest is that for the computer science community to work harder on posting things to the arxiv before submitting to ACM journals and if that's not possible, then lobbying for journals to accept this.  Then, for people who are ok with the rough version, they can access it and for people with need/resources, they can access the final, polished, piece.<p>In the meantime, try writing the author if you need a paper.  In the physics community, many authors are happy to send you a pdf file.  One time there was a paper from an expensive publication that we didn't have access to that I wrote the author to request a copy from.  He actually sent a reprint--from Japan!",1295898069

Most agencies are at least partially publicly funded, so there is no reason keep data behind closed doors. Of the 800 or so transit agencies in the US, only about 150 provide their data publicly today. (Many more provide their data to Google, but not to the general public -- a strange state of affairs.)<p>The community has organically developed a three-pronged assault:<p>1. Use carrots to encourage agencies to provide their data.<p>Google Maps is a good carrot, as it gets agencies to use the common GTFS format. Unfortunately, Google is willing to take data from agencies that won't make their data otherwise publicly available, so it doesn't fix the entire problem.<p>Walk Score's Transit API [1] is another carrot. If agencies make their data public, it will immediately be available through this API. The Transit API makes it very easy for third-party developers to do great things with transit data, and it takes care of all the difficult issues: finding the data, keeping it current, and dealing with real-world bugs in the data. (Transit data headaches were my life for many months last year!)<p>2. Use sticks to encourage agencies to provide their data.<p>I helped build City Go Round [2] to shed light on the innovation that happens when agencies open their data. You can also see quite clearly what agencies in a given locale haven't yet ponied up their data. (Search in San Francisco, for example.)<p>3. Create a public clearinghouse so there is high visibility.<p>The GTFS Data Exchange, or GTFSDE [3], is where public GTFS data goes to live. It's a great resource for transit developers and, along with the GTFSDE mailing list, is the focal point for the community at the moment.<p>-Dave<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.walkscore.com/services/public-transit-api.php"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.walkscore.com/services/public-transit-api.php</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.citygoround.org/apps/nearby/?q=san%20francisco,%20ca"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.citygoround.org/apps/nearby/?q=san%20francisco,%2...</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://www.gtfs-data-exchange.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.gtfs-data-exchange.com/</a>",1295897120

Do you already have a logo? Do you have a color scheme in mind? Compile a list of sites you like/don't like and why the site falls into a particular column. These questions will help the designer from shooting in the dark at the design and ultimately save you time, money, and revisions.<p>As for payment, never pay full upfront. Maybe half upfront, and half upon completion. Or if you can do thirds that is even better. A third upfront, a third upon receipt of a couple mockups, and the final third upon delivery.<p>Make sure you have outlined how the final product will be delivered. Will they deliver via a PSD and you are responsible for getting it converted into HTML? Will they deliver working/valid HTML? If they are delivering HTML and image files, make sure they are using valid CSS. You don't want to spend another day or two converting pages of tables into valid CSS.<p>These are just some basic thoughts, but should get you going in the right direction.",1295895664

We have an online-only viewer and let you view articles for a limited amount of time (we call it a rental). If you are interested, please give it a shot and let me know how sufficient of an alternative it is. We currently allow 1 free rental (which will work for our ACM content), but we'll be adding free trials for our subscription plans instead very soon. <a href=""http://www.deepdyve.com"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.deepdyve.com</a> <a href=""http://www.deepdyve.com/browse/publishers/association-for-computing-machinery"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.deepdyve.com/browse/publishers/association-for-co...</a>",1295895626

We can keep graduating Mechanical engineers until the cows come home, but if someone can make more money (or, indeed, any money at all) being a stock trader or realtor, most would consider ME a dying industry in this service-based economy.<p>He seems to focus on industrial entrepreneurship, a capital-intensive proposition to be sure. I peg Brooks as a ""supply-side"" kinda guy, so he would probably point to tax cuts as the divining rod of spurring entrepreneurship in that area. Thing is, you can cut taxes all day, but if the bank won't lend you any cash because they're not lending anything much less to your really expensive first-time venture, tax cuts aren't gonna help.<p>And, VC cash is hard to find in the US unless you're doing software, consumer, web, mobile, or cleantech. If you're in ""old line"" tech like medical devices or consumer electronics, forget it. Overseas is where to go. Open up shop in Singapore if you're building the better artificial heart.",1295895614

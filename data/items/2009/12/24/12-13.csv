1013750,comment,1012090,1013101,0,0,lionhearted,,,"> Am I ""losing my home""? If I'm not, what distinguishes my repo agreement/lease from other peoples call option/mortgage?<p>I actually agree with your basic sentiment, but there is an answer to this. Losing a mortgaged home hurts more than an apartment because people tend to have greater levels of endowment effects -<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endowment_effect"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endowment_effect</a><p>> In behavioral economics, the endowment effect (also known as divestiture aversion) is a hypothesis that people value a good or service more once their property right to it has been established. In other words, people place a higher value on objects they own than objects that they do not.<p>Endowment effects is looking pretty robust at this point, it's been shown on a lot of unrelated types of goods and services. People have a much greater attachment to a ""home"" than an ""apartment"" - I mean you can even think of the difference in connotation and prestige between being a ""homeowner"" and ""renter"" - this probably isn't a good thing by the way, but it's definitely real.",1261659338

Too many edge cases and a serious maintenance problem in the longer term.<p>Before you know it you are maintaining your database connector more than you are your original reason for writing it (the problem that needed to be solved).<p>I'm not too familiar with the common lisp ecosystem but there is a reason why there are N reasons of doing things there, all of them with varying degrees of feature overlap and stability.<p>Unless you have a really good idea on how you are going to move the field as a whole forward by re-implementing something your time is <i>likely</i> (but not always!) better spent by improving a solution already out there than by writing another partial implementation from scratch.<p>The first few weeks of progress on anything new it always seems like you're literally on a roll, after that the slowdown comes and the hard work begins.",1261658966

1013742,comment,1013545,1013605,0,0,illumen,,,"Yeah, I do feel the same way about Apple.  Apple claims credit a lot more than Google.  Google is definitely way more free software friendly than Apple in my experience - like a whole different magnitude of more friendly :)<p>I see your point, but without giving proper credit, the developers of open source projects will not get credit outside of the project.  They won't get the credit from the press or from The People.<p>Even in other open source projects it would be nice to give credit more evenly.  As an example, many interviews or articles mention 'Guido the creator of python'.  Whereas the reality is that thousands of people have contributed to python to make it what it is today.<p>It's hard to give credit even when you try your hardest to.  Also, where do we draw the line?  Do we start with crediting Persian, Egyptian, and Greek mathematicians and artists?  Do we need to give a whole raft of references each time a trumpet is blown?  Do we list individual contributors?  Or just major contributors, or founders?  Or perhaps not mentioning anyone at all - which many hackers do.  An 'open source community project' is a nice compromise as it gives credit to everyone.<p>Perhaps 'Made by the people of the world, for the people of the world' would have been a better advertisement.<p>-- merry xmas",1261658520

1013731,comment,1013531,1013721,0,0,gabriel-coarna,,,"Sure. Spanish is also a good choice. I could have went on and on enumerating interesting languages and interesting reasons to learn them (like reading history, philosophy, or great literature in their original form).<p>As for your second point, as far as I know, Romanian's ties to Latin aren't only reasonably strong; Romanian is actually the most like-Latin language that is still spoken -- however, Spanish and French still sound horrible to me (and I took French for 11 years, in school).<p>Also -- and I just couldn't resist making this point -- do you really think that the French or the Italians are ever going to do something interesting enough to warrant learning their language? -- please note that I'm not saying anything bad about their past (that's awesome); but, if you're forward thinking, I think you're pretty safe assuming that they're glory days are (long) over.",1261657440

It's only spoken in a small, god-forsaken country that'll probably never amount to much of anything.\n\n  If you insist on learning another language -- it is my opinion that one should try to say something smart in one language, rather than something mediocre in a couple -- you should at least learn something that might actually prove useful -- like Chinese (if you're young and you foresee you'll still be around when they rule the world), or Russian (for more-or-less the same reason)</code></pre>",1261656183

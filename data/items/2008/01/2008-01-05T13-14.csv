If you ray trace your thumb at arms length back into your eyeballs, the image of your thumb will cover the fovea <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fovea"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fovea</a>  The fovea is the little dimple on your retina responsible for sharp vision.

We have excellent Internet banking systems over here (generally speaking better than yours, or so I hear), but there is no chance in hell that you'll have time to make a database of every single bank and its system. I tried out one of the other startups mentioned in the article, and one of them actually has _one_ Norwegian bank in its database...out of 30 or so.<p>I do, however, want to use your software. The systems currently in place are a _lot_ more clunky than they should be, and it is difficult to see the big picture in my personal finances without the pie charts.<p>Any suggestions? I have the potential to be a really devoted customer.",1199540769

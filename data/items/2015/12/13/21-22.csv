10728139,comment,10725284,10725284,0,0,pasbesoin,,,"I have been tortured by this all my life.  To the point where, now, after decades of trying to &quot;adapt&quot; per the wishes of my family, school, medical professionals, and workplace... and landing, ironically or whatever, in a series of apparently quiet when selecting but actually abnormally loud living circumstance -- well, to the point where my physical health is significantly and irreversibly destroyed.<p>A few things:<p>+ I am -- or was; the health issues now dominate -- able to concentrate, quite intensely and effectively.  But I needed a QUIET and distraction free environment in which to do so.<p>+ Academically, I was, despite these problems, quite successful.  Grade-curve-distorting successful.<p>+ I was flagged from an early age as &quot;gifted&quot;.  I still remember one of the initial tests and being told the results -- in fourth grade.  Despite this, the school system never seemed to have an understanding, sympathy, nor accommodation for my environmental needs.  This left me feeling &quot;broken&quot; and very frustrated and anxious.<p>+ Pernicious bullying, whether related or not, led to something for which I only decades later received a term and gradual, reluctant acceptance of its validity with respect to me: Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD).<p>+ I am actually quite GOOD at collaboration.  I just can&#x27;t do it in a noisy, distracting environment -- except during bursts of stress and adrenalin (e.g. imminent deadlines) and when the work is actually suited to the environment -- e.g. more of a physical component, working together to complete a physical task that can also have a significant mental component.<p>In corporate workplaces that increasingly tortured me with cubes turning into low-walled corners with someone sitting 3 feet off my shoulder in my peripheral vision.  Etc.  Nonetheless, I got to know people across these very substantial organizations.  And we&#x27;d simply &quot;get stuff done&quot;, short-circuiting some of the bureaucracy while actually improving safety and results by keeping and eye open and reaching out when things didn&#x27;t seem right.<p>----<p>So, understand that such people can be very productive and collaborative and, often in their own, quiet, non-aggressive way, social.<p>Early on, they/we need to learn this about ourselves and that we, of necessity, must advocate for and, OR, more simply achieve, the kind of workspace and living environment we need.<p>In times past, that might have meant a bit more remote home and a job or workspace off by itself.  These days, in the modern Western world (my experience), these things can be very hard to achieve -- our personal landscapes so packed and full of ever noisier devices:  Televisions; stereos; car stereos with those ridiculous, block-shaking subwoofers.<p>And especially early on, a mainstream that practically compels us to struggle with these environments by dint of an exhausting, chronic stress.  Perhaps the home environment.  Certainly school.  Junior workspaces packed together like veal.  Economic circumstances that only allow apartment living where those devices I mentioned seem to make the experience louder and louder, year by year, and social mores that ever more seem to populate building with people who think the only consideration they need have is for themself.<p>So... pardon what has become my ramble/rant, here.<p><i>I would like to make the point that, if you are not one of these people, please don&#x27;t simply discount them.  They are often actually very kind and accommodating and helpful people, if they can simply have their peace and quiet.  If they are not stressed into that &quot;fight or flight&quot; frame of mind.  ALL we want from you is a bit of peace and quiet.  Just for ourselves; we don&#x27;t care what you do nor how you want to fill your day.  Just let us have our quiet and concentration.  Our own bit of space.</i><p>Personally, I feel most of my chances for this life are past.  Of the few things left that I might actually accomplish, communicating this in a manner that makes life easier -- in this respect -- for future people like me, is a primary goal.",1450043719

You are in the very small minority of the 300m people in the US and the 7bn people in the world. For everyone else, visually dragging and dropping will be a much easier way to visualize and set up networks.<p>This product is not for you - it&#x27;s for the vastly larger market outside of computer scientists/embedded engineers.<p>When you can demonstrate this value prop to the mass consumer market, under the MIT brand nonetheless, big companies like Audi will start to pay attention because they see an avenue to market an increasingly heterogeneous product (luxury sedan) to the rich, older folks who buy these things based on cool new features - automated avoidance, tying volume into acceleration, &quot;Intelligent Drive&quot; [1], projected HUD [2], etc.<p>As we see from the video, Audi has granted this researcher access to APIs that would be completely inaccessible otherwise. This is another key - API access. Could you control the features in your car through a webpage? No, because you don&#x27;t have access to your windows or your stereo, unless you do some intensive and illegal hacking.<p>M2M and IoT has been contained mostly to the realm of industrial/auto applications so far. So once big companies start to see the consumer market opening up through a simpler, more intuitive interface, they might start opening up APIs to new machines and products.<p>Of course, allowing access to these APIs opens up a whole new can of safety worms...but that&#x27;s going to be an increasingly large issue that we will have to deal with as we continue to integrate software and connectivity into new products.<p>[1] <a href=""https://www.mbusa.com/mercedes/technology/videos/detail/title-safety/videoId-fc0835ab8d127410VgnVCM100000ccec1e35RCRD"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.mbusa.com/mercedes/technology/videos/detail/titl...</a><p>[2] <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sg3mmfVILRA"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sg3mmfVILRA</a>",1450042133

Every magnet is composed of a north pole and a south pole.  If you split a magnet in two, you get two magnets, each with a north pole and a south pole.  You <i>never</i> get a magnet with more &quot;north&quot; charges than &quot;south&quot;.<p>This means that the &quot;north&quot; and &quot;south&quot; portions of the field right are always next to each other.  Which also means that when you go very far from a magnet, the <i>net</i> effect of the magnet is zero.  Because the two fields cancel each other out.<p>So we should expect that magnetism doesn&#x27;t have many practical impacts on our daily life.  If you&#x27;re close to a magnet, you might feel it.  But if you&#x27;re far away, you won&#x27;t be able to feel a magnetic field.<p>Electricity is a bit different.  The positive and negative charges can be separated from one another, unlike magnetism.<p>This means that when electrical charges are separated, there is a force pulling them together for differing charges, or separating them for similar charges.  The net effect over time is that most objects should be electrically neutral.  Because the charges will naturally come together.<p>So we should expect that electricity has an impact on our daily life.  We should be able to tell when the charges are separated.  This occurs only for a short time, until the charges move and cancel each other out.<p>Gravity is different again.  There is no &quot;positive&quot; and &quot;negative&quot; charges with gravity.  It&#x27;s <i>all positive</i>.<p>This means that when two gravitational bodies are separated, there will be a force pulling them together.  The net effect is that all objects with &quot;gravitational charge&quot; will tend to clump together.<p>So we should expect that gravity has a <i>huge</i> impact on our lives.  We should always be able to tell that gravity exists.<p>Note that these conclusions are <i>independent of the relative strengths of the forces</i>.  Magnetism and electricity will generally have net zero impact.  Gravity will have net positive impact.<p>If gravity was <i>strong</i>, like the other forces, then gravitational objects would group together.  A <i>lot</i>.  Which means that the universe would end up as one big clump of matter.<p>It&#x27;s only because gravity is <i>weak</i> that we have gravitational objects which are separate from each other for any extended period of time.",1450041236

As history ran its course and those OSes fell by the wayside, those languages were naturally marginalized (did there even exist usable Mesa/Modula-2/etc. compilers for Unix?).<p>Rust is different because it is <i>not</i> beholden to the fate of any single operating system. Not only is it cross-platform by intent, it has hitched its cart to a world-class retargetable backend for the dominant systems languages of today, meaning that platform availability will never be a problem.<p>There are still plenty of reasons why Rust could fail, of course. But Rust does not require the OS vendors&#x27; permission to exist on their platforms (well, except for on non-jailbroken iOS, anyway), and the Rust devs are not especially concerned with those platforms integrating Rust into their kernels (though I&#x27;m sure they wouldn&#x27;t mind).",1450041161

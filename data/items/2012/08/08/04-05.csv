4353995,comment,4350366,4352552,1,0,codeonfire,,,"It's not cynicism, it's just logic and my observation of how several tech companies operate.  It may seem great that a company would want to promote its novices, but the fact that it operates with novices doing the work precludes this.  It's not economical to promote and pay more just for the sake of promotion.  All they need are novices so why pay senior wages?  Turnover does have some cost, so companies will either bait there employees into staying a bit longer by promoting one or two people and letting everyone know that person's new salary, or they will just not promote anyone.  Either way, most people are going to look elsewhere after 2-3 years of flat salaries.",1344401959

Having said that, I also think Samsung is actually somewhat toxic for the Android community in that anyone with a bit of common sense can see that they do, in fact, borrow a bit too much from Apple with their hardware designs and custom UI skin look.<p>This is bad for the wider Android ecosystem because it gives some truth to Apple's claims that ""Android"" rips off the iPhone/iPad even though IMO the core Android UI/UX stands on its own merits and in many ways bests the somewhat aging UX of the iPhone.  What little soapbox Apple has to stand on is primarily due to Samsung being both unwilling to roll with standard Android UI and also lacking their own design talent capable of doing much other than badly copying Apple.<p>As a former iPhone 3G user who went Android with the Droid I thought for years that Apple was completely full of shit with their anti-Android stuff, but a few months ago I actually used a friend's Samsung Android phone for the first time and my opinion changed fairly drastically when I saw how blatantly it copied the iPhone 3G in terms of form factor and general look.  This likeness went far beyond ""Apple thinks they own the rectangle"", but sadly because Samsung is so shameless, those claims actually end up having more weight than they should.",1344400453

The idea of burying language selection within an incomprehensible color band (that will only work on non-touch devices) boggles my mind.</i><p>- <i>Many, many important principles are tossed away. Why do the designers change the meaning of the ""history"" button?  Burying the revision history is counter to all things that wikis stand for.</i><p>- <i>Research into the Foundation projects would tell you that storing a user's browsing history is against the privacy policy - so why include that?</i><p>-  > ""Sharing functions will be the same so no change is necessary"" - <i>except that there are no sharing functions.</i><p>- <i>The most basic principle of product design is ""Know the product,"" and these designers do not.</i><p>And finally,<p><i>This is to say nothing of the exercise in 'brand manipulation.'  The most powerful brand that Wikipedia has is the wordmark itself (""wikipedia""), followed by the distinctive ""W"" logo (crossed ""v"" characters), followed by a single puzzle piece, followed by the puzzle globe.

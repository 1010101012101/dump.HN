5601799,comment,5600852,5601549,1,0,washedup,,,"Yea, good point, it all depends on where the volume was. I would break it up this way:<p>The initial sell off: These orders would be executed from traders that use a live twitter feed to make buying or selling decisions. The underlying algorithm would have been able to execute these orders faster than any human. The serious news would have driven them to sell quickly, causing the market to start diving. Most of these probably made money, depending on how they were able to react to the news that it was fake. It is possible that there were algorithms selling all the way down the entire spike with the expectation that it was going to go down even further, losing money on most of the positions during the bounce. After-all, the bounce was faster than the drop.<p>Secondary sell off: While the algorithms are executing sell orders, market makers would begin to realize that a huge volatility spike was entering the market place, whether they heard the bad news or not. Because market makers train their models on relatively low volatile intra-day data, this spike would have been enough to reach either max positions or max downdraw, forcing the traders (or the market making algos they created) to cover positions for a loss on the way down.",1366815577

A productive investment is something that will pay the amount due + interest + leave you something to leave on. Physicial capital (tools) is an investment. Today you must have a really good reason to buy your own server instead of paying-as-you-go for a virtual server. Education may - or may not be, it 's a complex question (credentialing may mean you need paper diplomas more than the actual knowledge)<p>3) Leave beyond your expenses, save and invest. There're various websites with suggestions on how to do that exactly.<p>The most important thing is the endgoal : no debt, money in the bank, freedom to work on jobs or projects you value, without the short term constraints of putting food on the table.<p>When in doubt about making a debt, go see 2) - purchasing property to flip it on the market is taking a risk. If you have followed 3), it's a risk you can take.<p>Now let's translate that to development debt :<p>1) you should fix your code now, unless there are more productive uses of your time. Fixing old complex code is like fighting inflation - don't bother. You may win some battle but can't win the war. Fixing new code however is a good idea, while it's still clear in your head.<p>2) you shouldn't have made a technical debt in the first place, except to ensure a sale or quick money. if you did, you'd rather have a good reason and some profits to show<p>3) code in a ""beginner me could understand that"" way. Remember it takes someone twice as intelligent to debug some code, so make life easy for yourself.<p>The end goal is the same : code that work, with the freedom to repurpose it, without the short term hassle of fighting bugs everyday.<p>When in doubt about creating technical debt, go see 2) - feature creep to try to secure a sale is taking a risk. If you have followed 3) and your code base is clean enough, it's a risk you can take.<p>EDIT : Downvotes, really? At -1 now ?? Please tell me how I am not following the guidelines and not contributing to the discussion.<p>EDIT2: falcolas, sorry, but I see technical debt just like real life debt. It is a powerful and dangerous tool, and if one is looking for solutions on a blog where a guy advise playing around for the fun of it you're not doing to lower your technical debt - you're going deeper into technical debt.<p>In his own works : ""hacking debt"" : <i>""Some portion of a career should be devoted to hacking. Not 100%, but not 0% either. Without some time spent exploring and having fun, people become less effective and eventually burn out.""</i>.<p>Huh? ""hacking debt"" won't resolve the ""technical debt"" - that's completely unrelated. I just don't and can't agree with his approach of playtime for the sake of it. One should remember the dead simple advice posted above (and heavily downvoted) before trying to do better. Not everyone is a rockstar or a special gem needing daily bouts of playtime to keep inspiration. Most however need to keep a training routine and consider which technical debt is worth taking on, and which is worth leaving aline.<p>BTW, as I posted 2 weeks ago (<a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5508906"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=5508906</a>) :<p><i>""Take a military analogy - if you're not doing something ""shippable"" (ex: fighting), you are training to maintain or raise your potential for when you will have to get in action - or at least to maintain discipline.""</i><p>That's not playing for the sake of playing or having fun.

This means that to play a video the system in question has to load up not just video codecs but a full-stack VM -- Flash -- as well, and the CPU is responsible for most of that responsibility. At that point the power efficiencies gained by offloading functionality to a dedicated chip are lost.<p>Now, Adobe might have pursued a route wherein those functions were offloaded to the AVC chip and/or the GPU, but they were not apparently successful in being able to do so.<p>> Although I do agree with your comment, I think that Apple's reasons for ditching Flash went beyond their public words.<p>Why?

The thing is, I could already see the handwriting on the wall even a couple years ago. Adobe was running around with their heads cut off trying to figure out how to develop flash. They just had no idea what they were doing. The compiler wasn't very good and simple performance problems with the VM and flash timeline weren't fixed at all. Instead, we got immediately abandoned projects that just sapped resources from more worthwhile endeavors. You basically had to use haxe to get good performance for certain applications.<p>With all of these issues known to Adobe you might suspect that they would move aggresively to increase the performance of Flash in general and Flex in particular. More integrated tools would have also gone a long way in improving the developer experience for flash/flex. Instead, Adobe went ahead with the strange creation otherwise known as Flex 4. Adobe decided that the main issue with Flex applications was their poor 'skinability.' Flash catalyst made no sense, and was totally unusable for serious application development. It was another tool (bringing the count to 3) for flash/flex authoring that did nothing to solve the problems with the platform.<p>To sum up, if Adobe had:
-aggressively targeted 3D gaming from the start
-built powerful authoring capabilities in the flash ide rather than supporting multiple development environments
-addressed performance, security and cpu issues with the plugin
-developed the as3 language
-not wasted time on mobile browser plugins
-trust the flash ecosystem to fill in gaps as they worked on the platform<p>the story might have turned out differently. Of course, they didn't do any of those things when they had the chance",1366812549

There seems to be a sentiment that these sorts of moves are catastrophic and avoidable, but the reality is that these are movements reacting to real information from the environment that will affect the future state of economics.

In fact, I would guess that the <i>majority</i> of people hurt by this volatility spike were market making or algorithmic traders. They either were directly linked to twitter text feeds, selling on the way down and buying at the top of the retracement; or dump positions put on earlier in the morning. Of course, if the event happened, these traders would have been the winners.<p>The problem with this current situation is that the high-speed news delivery services spread this fake tweet without any verification (except trust that the AP feed is trust-worthy), and people with direct access to these services were most likely individuals with access to trading accounts, allowing them to drop a variety of assets, most notable the DOW or S&P.",1366812077

So right there, you can assume at least 5-10 minutes without any circulation.

Now, here's the thing: ""Success"" in all those cases means nothing more than 'Return Of Spontaneous Circulation' (ROSC). In layman's terms: the heart would start beating. 
That - of course - tells you next to nothing about brain damage.<p>The elephant in the room is, that when you end up being CPR'd in the street by the EMS after no circulation for 5 - 10 minutes, you better wish that you don't end up with ROSC. Because in all likelyhood you will (if you don't die after a few days in hospital / they kindly pull the plug) end with about as much brain activity as the chair you are sitting on right now.<p>Again: YMMV and I personally know a guy who was successfully resuscitated and became a paramedic after that. But I try to base life decisions on statistics and not anecdotes, so I personally prefer having a living will set up.",1366812072

The strengths of the movie are less in the overarching plot and with the details, such as the soundtrack, cinematography, and excellent script.<p>At first blush, this new script looks remarkably original.  That being said, everything's relative: there's the old cliche that every possible story has already been told, and I think the trick is less to put forward something new and more to put forward something great.<p>In terms of the strategy behind the campaign: it seems very much in the vein of the Veronica Mars kickstarter (<a href=""http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/559914737/the-veronica-mars-movie-project"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/559914737/the-veronica-m...</a>), in the sense that its appealing more to the fans of the original work (I'd imagine the cult of Veronica Mars fans and the cult of Garden State fans has some significant overlap.)",1366812047

Indeed, some customers might not want to have the same design, but some don't care if they pay less (small companies), some websites already have a list of available templates. The other main reason would be reordering, another one would be to avoid some revisions (like  change in the job title).<p>About validating my idea, it's what I am trying to do, quite a tricky task :/. Any advices on how to do that would be really appreciated.",1366812005

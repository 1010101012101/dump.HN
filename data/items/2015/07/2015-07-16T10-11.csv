They don&#x27;t diagnose young children anymore even if it seems likely since some children will &quot;catch up&quot; and stop exhibiting symptoms. This is the source of many teens and adults today that discover that once they stop taking medication they don&#x27;t need it. As our understanding of the disorder grows so does our ability to accurately diagnose it.<p>That said, while I can&#x27;t speak for the person you replied to that shit <i>is</i> incredibly frustrating. Your empathy is unusual and appreciated but regardless of the rate of misdiagnosis you are not a doctor and are admittedly entirely ignorant about it.<p>I can&#x27;t emphasize enough to those reading this that no matter how much you might doubt it, the people who work in this field do in fact know more about it than you do and making an armchair diagnosis or questioning a doctor&#x27;s diagnosis does nothing but make you look like the kind of know-it-all that really knows nothing while maligning someone who has to read ignorant comments like yours in every damn discussion on the internet where ADHD comes up.<p>I know it&#x27;s easy to think you&#x27;ve got all of the answers when understanding complex problems comes naturally but these doctors don&#x27;t spend nearly a decade or more in school sitting around with their thumbs up their asses. There are tremendous amounts of research going into ADHD by doctors and scientists who actually understand the problem domain more thoroughly than you ever could simply by reading a headline about a study that documents the rate of misdiagnosis for a disorder.<p>Please understand this disorder is not some cry for attention or an exaggeration of one or two symptoms you mildly share with those that suffer through it every single day. It&#x27;s not &quot;laziness&quot; or a lack of discipline and determination. People with ADHD lose their jobs and destroy relationships with family and friends alike. It&#x27;s humiliating and the cherry on top of the shit sundae is friends, family and every asshole on the internet accusing you of faking it. No one wants that. No one wants to learn that there&#x27;s a genetic component and guess what, your kid&#x27;s lives might suck too. Even with medication. Methamphetamine is not some magic cure-all. It only addresses a subset of symptoms. No one wants to struggle every day wondering why they should even bother getting out of bed because it&#x27;s exhausting fighting yourself.<p>Sorry for the rant.",1437044165

Getting up in the tiers enough to always get free upgrades to Premium Economy didn&#x27;t take much, and the top tiers are actually possible to reach if you travel a bit for business, unlike e.g. British Airlines where you practically have to live in the air to get to their higher tiers.<p>Business on United did not match business on e.g. BA or Virgin, but on the other hand upgrades to business on United was as reliable as clockwork - I got upgrades ca. every 3rd leg once I&#x27;d gotten to one of their upper tiers (which includes a multiplier on miles).<p>If you fly now and again for leisure, base it on what you&#x27;ll pay for, sure.

There has always been  evidence that AD patients sleep less than the general population, but obviously there&#x27;s a  chicken and egg problem here - are they sleeping less because of neuronal disruption caused by the disease, or is the disease progression catalyzed by a lack of sleep[1-3]? While I think this is still an open question, there&#x27;s growing research that interaction with sleep related systems in the brain can have a major therapeutic impact on the disease itself - obviously this doesn&#x27;t actually answer if it&#x27;s &#x27;sleep&#x27; or some process related to sleep, but clearly something is going on here [4].<p>From the press release associated with [4];<p><i>The new research, in mice, demonstrates that eliminating the protein – called orexin – made mice sleep for longer periods of time and strongly slowed the production of brain plaques.<p>“This indicates we should be looking hard at orexin as a potential target for preventing Alzheimer’s disease,” said senior author David M. Holtzman, MD, head of the Department of Neurology. “Blocking orexin to increase sleep in patients with sleep abnormalities, or perhaps even to improve sleep efficiency in healthy people, may be a way to reduce the risk of Alzheimer’s. This is important to explore  further.”

When I mess up my sleeping schedule pretty bad (which happened a lot back in college), I usually do sleep paralysis when falling asleep (as opposed to when waking up). And I can do it 6 or 7 times in a row, it&#x27;s a nightmare. Usually though, I realize what&#x27;s going on (it&#x27;s happened to me so. many. times.) after the second or third &#x27;paralysis&#x27; and sleep on my stomach, which for some reason, allows me to fall asleep without the whole paralysis thing going on. You can actually turn sleep paralysis into a lucid dream if you &#x27;control&#x27; it properly. I usually just wake up thinking &#x27;thank god I&#x27;m alive&#x27; though.<p>For those interested in sleep paralysis, wikipedia&#x27;s got a pretty good page about it:

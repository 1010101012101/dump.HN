6849701,comment,6849057,6849057,2,0,danso,,,"This is an impressive service (the speed, especially)...collation of different data sources into one easily accessible form is a hugely useful and underrated service. That said...there&#x27;s no such thing as better security without an equal tradeoff. Here, it&#x27;s now much easier (especially with the site response speed) for a third party to look up email addresses, see who they&#x27;ve patronized, and aggregate them into a database of less noble intent.<p>To check if a given email address was an Adobe/Gawker/whatever customer, you would&#x27;ve not only had to query every separate form but you would also not be guaranteed to get a definitive response (because some services will be ambiguous to whether you got a password wrong or whether the account exists at all). With the OP&#x27;s service, with positive hits, you not only get confirmation of patronage, but knowledge that they are vulnerable, even if in a small, outdated way.<p>It&#x27;s likely something Troy has anticipated but didn&#x27;t want to outright say...In the end, knowledge is better than ignorance, and the correct response is for more rapid response to hacked victims and better security awareness.

The point I was trying to make is that with the absence of data, you have to make assumptions and they should be clearly defined.  My assumptions defined his starting age and how he obtained the first 2 sheep and the fact they were his.<p>I guess I would want my kids too look at any math problem with the following things in mind:\n  * identify units of measurement\n  * identify useful data\n  * identify non-useful data\n  * identify assumptions needed to complete answer<p>There are more or different assumptions I could make, such as cooperative breeding amoungst other breeders or a larger flock to start with, or a completely different model of breeding sheep.  I could have described a scenario where he started with 2 sheep and went through several trading and auction rounds until he had 125 with some bonus dogs like the guy that got a house from a paper clip.<p>We don&#x27;t have a time measurement in years, so we need some type of sheep per time or time per sheep unit.  I choose an assumption of breeding and came up with about 1 sheep per year per sheep.<p>The original question is very close to a nonsense question, which requires so many assumptions that probably most answers can be well defended with the right set of assumptions.  But at the very least you would hope a student could identify an answer in years could not be obtained with the given data of # of sheep and # of dogs.<p>(And, no, I don&#x27;t think the units method is beyond an eight grader, even if the educational system thinks it is.

6849648,comment,6847867,6847867,103,0,grellas,,,"While there is a pithy debate going on about Kima and how it fares in an economic comparison to YC, I will throw in my more technical assessment of what founders should consider in deciding whether the sort of up-front equity funding offered by Kima is right for them in the first place.<p>Seed funding can be a tricky proposition for startups.<p>The broad choices in dealing with the early expenses are: (1) self-fund by making founder loans/advances to the company, whether for demand or convertible notes; (2) get friends and family money, usually in the form of a convertible note; (3) go to institutional investors and either argue for an acceptable valuation as part of a seed equity funding or bypass that issue and hope to get bridge money via convertible notes. Of course, in the right cases, founders can also sell products and far-more-typically services to generate enough funds in the early going to fund development efforts tied to a longer-term strategy.<p>In working with founders over many years, it has been my rule of thumb that they should <i>not</i> do too early of an equity round unless there was some very special reason for doing so. Equity rounds come with strings and complications. They require that you set a value on the venture. That in turn means you need to negotiate the issue of price precisely when you are at your weakest as a founder trying to build value. It also means you create tax risks and complications: if the equity round is too near the time of formation, the $.0001/sh pricing used by founders for their shares may look funny next to the much higher amount per share paid by investors, raising risks that the founders can be deemed to have received their shares at the higher valuation as potentially taxable service income; once you do an equity round, you will need to do 409A valuations in connection with doing option grants and that necessitates getting outside independent appraisals; equity rounds come with strings, including investor preferences, investor protective provisions limiting what you can do as a founder without investor approval, co-sale and first refusal rights favoring investors and concomitantly limiting founders, board seats and/or observer rights for investors, and the like. Much of the &quot;distraction&quot; that founders face in raising money exists precisely because a typical equity round can be a complex process and, apart from needing to sell the economic proposition behind their venture, founders must also make sure that any funds they do take in are taken on reasonable terms. Sorting through the issues of company valuation, preferences, and similar issues takes time and can be a grueling process. What is more, when you have emerged from the process, you will find yourself having to price your equity incentives to key people you are trying to attract at a much higher price than you otherwise would have if you had not done the equity round.<p>So, in the early stage, it is usually best to defer all this and focus on building value with funds made available through some sort of bridge instrument such as a convertible note if possible. In such cases, with institutional investors, you may still find yourself arguing about valuation in negotiating caps but the process is nowhere near as involved as it is with a typical equity round and founders with leverage can usually dispense with caps as well. Apart from the cap issue, most of the other complications simply go away. You retain substantially complete founder independence with almost no strings on what you can do going forward (subject to normal legal rules involving fiduciary duty, of course). You retain virtually complete control of the timing and terms of your future funding choices without needing investor approval to make the choices as you like. And you basically eliminate the tax risks altogether. Finally, because you have not had to price your stock, you retain flexibility to continue offering very cheap equity incentives to others, including those who may become potential co-founders, without creating tax problems for them or for your company.<p>There are cases where founders prefer to do an equity round in spite of the complications. Maybe they can get the equity on good terms with a favorable valuation and even without the complications of doing it as preferred stock (e.g., in some friends and family situations). Maybe they prefer not to have debt on their balance sheet, with the legal obligation to pay it back in case they can&#x27;t do a qualified funding round. Maybe they just need cash fast and the people they are dealing with it are ready to do it on oppressive terms that are easier swallowed than would be shuttering the venture. Or, on the positive side, maybe it means taking funds on less than ideal terms but from an investor who will add large value to the venture apart from the cash element. Who knows? It is a big world and people have all sorts of reasons for choosing one way or the other. The point is that they need to think through the pros and cons carefully and make a wise choice for their circumstances.<p>The Kima offering offers fast cash to qualified ventures. This has an obvious advantage of being simple and fast for those who qualify. Whether it is the best choice for a given venture turns on how the founders in that venture see the trade-offs. If you take the Kima offer, you will wind up doing an equity round. It will be for preferred stock. It is for cash only, with no value-add. Thus, you will have the tax complications that attend an equity funding, including needing to price your stock and option grants based on the $1 million company valuation and the need to do 409A valuations. Moreover, the strings that appear in Kima&#x27;s term sheet are not trivial: the valuation is based on no larger than a 5% equity pool; you give up a board seat; you give Kima a broad veto power on many of your future actions relating to fundraising and other important company matters; you agree to restrictions on how the value is shared in case you are acquired. If the answer to this is that it is worth it for many startups to make such tradeoffs in exchange for fast cash, I would add that these funds are not being offered to just any startup. Kima reserves the right to cull through the submissions and pick from the best only. While that is fine, of course, it does mean that the value of the offering must be weighed against other choices open to the same level of quality startup that it hopes to fund and not against the more limited choices open to just any startup. The biggest question I would have for those startups is this: fast and easy cash, yes, but are the complications worth it for $150K if other reasonable options are open to you? While they may be for some, for a good number the answer would very likely be no.<p>How does Kima compare with YC? PG has assessed the broad economic proposition to which I would add the following: YC does take an immediate equity grant but does so with common stock and on terms that don&#x27;t affect founder stock pricing. Thus, near-complete founder freedom is preserved and there are no special strings that come with the investment. This stands in pretty sharp distinction to the Kima terms, which involve preferred stock and a number of strings. But by the far the biggest differential that I see comes with the value-add piece: with YC, founders pay a price in terms of equity they give up but they get huge benefits from becoming part of a network that keys them in to relationships and solutions that can prove invaluable to an early-stage startup. In effect, founders pay (somewhat) dearly in early equity to partner with a powerful ally that may dramatically speed up and enhance their path to success. This sort of trade-off is not worth it for all companies but, for those that dream to do significant scaling and that need to have doors opened to future VC investors, the YC stamp of approval and the YC resources offer value that is not easily found elsewhere. Of course, no angel investor, Kima included, can match this in any comparison, though such investors can add value in various lesser ways from their relationships and the like.<p>Different founders have different needs. What Kima is doing is new and innovative and the people behind Kima are savvy and sophisticated players in the startup investment world. Therefore, it is very nice to see this sort of slant on seed financing. But, again, there are always trade-offs and founders should weigh these carefully in deciding whether the Kima way is the way they want to choose.",1386186678

6849449,comment,6849167,6849167,8,0,danso,,,"I think this is a great writeup and so I apologize in advance for what is going to sound like a bunch of armchair criticism...but why is <i>money</i> -- or <i>profit</i> the primary metric here?<p>There are lots of cool wins here. Putting together a &quot;rockstar team&quot;, as the OP says (i.e. building relationships), hustling, and just plain going out on a limb and trying something halfway crazy. Those are all good ways to spend a weekend, young or old.<p>But making $1000 for 26 hours of work, with most of that money coming from the seller&#x27;s personal network? That&#x27;s not a headline-worthy achievement, nor is it a real measure of success. 44 hours between 8 people is a <i>lot</i> of work-hours, nevermind the opportunity cost of the recovery period the next day. The main problem, of course, is that the sales came primarily from the personal network, which is not a real indicator of anything when the time period is just a few days of sprinting.<p>So while I again commend the OP for taking the time to write down thoughts and reflections...I think there should&#x27;ve been <i>more</i> reflection on how reliable these conclusions are. &quot;Acquiring customers is ALL that matters&quot;? Matters for <i>what</i>? Making a nominal amount that matches a number (1,000) that looks good in a headline? I agree that people can obsess with things like website domain and styles too much...but that&#x27;s different than concluding that customers don&#x27;t really care. I&#x27;ve seen unremarkable Kickstarters become huge because of well-written pitches and a lot of time invested into the pitch video. You can&#x27;t really say that user/customer experience doesn&#x27;t really matter...especially if your sample size is your personal network in a period of days.<p>Another thing to consider...what about the ongoing costs? It&#x27;s one thing to ramp up to get customers...it&#x27;s another to service these customers who, presumably, have to be managed during the lifetime of their subscription...That&#x27;s another potential opportunity cost.<p>OK, one more complaint. I think this bullet point is really specious:<p>> <i>Determine what works and focus on it… this takes discipline.  \nWe started off with low hanging fruit — close friends and family.</i><p>The OP describes a telemarketing type situation...which, I have to say, is something I regret not doing enough of because my friends who&#x27;ve spent summers/years doing telemarketing as a temp job are some of the most easy-going, well-balanced people I know, due to their ability to take rejection. However, they&#x27;ve been doing it <i>long periods of time</i>...doing a weekend of cold calls is not quite the same thing for building that tough skin. And you don&#x27;t get discipline in a sprint, but continuing to do the work after the euphoria is over.<p>OK that was more complainy than necessary...Again, great writeup by the OP (putting yourself out there is never trivial) and hope to see a follow up in 2-4 weeks",1386185311

OTOH, if they just didn&#x27;t grasp information, or didn&#x27;t try, they deserve something other than an A.<p>There is no easy answer, and it varies by course. In an algorithms course you are going to learn trees, sorting, graphs, and complexity analysis. If you master those, why not an A? Sure, you can make the course insanely hard, and force the students to do essentially original research to get an A, but what is the point there, exactly? You end up with a pressure-cooker, swamped with work school just to create a bell curve. I spent so much of my University time on my own research ideas, helping professors, and so on - course work was almost a back drop. I think I got so much more out of it doing it that way. A competitive fight of churning out massive amounts of work against other straight-A&#x27;s in high school type-A personalities? Not so valuable (IMO). Time to think, dream, and experiment is what is valuable, and how do you put a grade on that?<p>edit: I take this back somewhat. In some fields it definitely pays off to have a broader foundation. I took quite a few math classes, but would have profited by by even more. Lots of research papers are tough going because I don&#x27;t have all the math.

Several professors in the conversation said they weren&#x27;t comfortable with writing a recommendation or encouraging a particular student to go on to graduate work, but that it was difficult to convince these students that thhe weren&#x27;t cut out for it after they had given them As in upper level courses.<p>At my alma mater the grade A+ was used in some departments for this sort of purpose. It wasn&#x27;t mandatory, and it didn&#x27;t count towards GPA, sometimes no one got one at all, but it signaled something to the students who did.<p>Separately I had one professor, in history of all things, who was a notoriously tough grader but was retiring the next semester after I had her.

They completed all the assignments and did their absolute best as far as I could tell. Some were definitely better than others (A vs. A-), but giving the hardworking but not genius students Bs just made them stressed out.  They would come to office hours to ask how they could improve. The only true answer I could give was &quot;there are 2-3 students in this class that are just incredibly creative and gifted writers, they get the As.&quot;<p>Maybe it&#x27;s the role of a teacher to stack rank students, but it&#x27;s no fun.

Kids here put an absurd amount of work into their classes. It&#x27;s not surprising that the average GPA is a 3.6, because the average assignment actually is A- level work. The obvious argument against this is that the grades should be curved so that the average level of work receives a C... but what do you do when most kids are getting the same top grades on tests, or writing the same high quality papers? It&#x27;s a hard problem to solve, and as long as other colleges have grade inflation, it would be disadvantageous to your students to not have it.<p>The problem I have is differing GPA distributions between majors. History majors have a much easier time getting in the  3.6-4.0 range than CS majors, because history teachers will rarely give anything less than a B. So when a CS major applies to jobs that other majors are also applying to (say, finance), he can look bad in comparison.",1386184446

This is necessary because the information in the document is unstructured, it&#x27;s not like an order form.<p>Because you cannot predict what form unstructured information will take, the presentational logic is necessarily strongly coupled with the information. That&#x27;s why it&#x27;s hard to do what you want. You can pop open Dev Tools and manually do it, but you can&#x27;t write a program that will take _all blog posts_ and restructure them the way you want to, because _all blog posts_ is impossible to reason about.<p>No amount of evolution to the HTML or CSS standards will work out this particular bit of complexity. If you could standardize a blog post, then you could write a program to do it. But it would only work on posts that meet the standard.<p>Say you made it so every blog CMS out there stored the text in the DB in Markdown format and provided an API so you could get at the Markdown. Then you could do what you say, provide your own styling. What this would be doing is introducing a separation of concerns. You push most of structure out of the data, and divide up styling duties between a base level (Markdown) and an upper level. (whatever you&#x27;re using to display it) You may not even need the API if the CMS doesn&#x27;t screw around too much with the presentation by putting, say, ads, in the middle of the content. Then you could screen scrape and convert the generated HTML back into Markdown, but again, this is the wrong way to go, (depending on concretion rather than abstraction) and prone to breakage. You really need the API layer to do this properly.<p>But you can&#x27;t hope that one day HTML and CSS will make sense again like the old days and that user-styling will work again.

I think the problem is confusing macro and micro.  On a micro level yes one individual can rise above others in that way.  However, on a macro level diverting capital out of productive enterprises into merely increasing existing underemployment stats makes the overall situation worse for everyone, not better.<p>I&#x27;m not saying education is worthless, or underemployment should be 0% (or maybe it should?).<p>Think about this analogy.  Maximum productivity resulting in maximum wealth for everyone involved happens when a factory produces 1000 cars.  I know, lets produce 1500 cars, and also increase prices 10% per year, then having those unsold cars sit on the lot will make society as a whole wealthier because ... err, I guess it makes society as a whole substantially poorer.  Don&#x27;t get me wrong, I&#x27;m not saying producing 1500 is a disaster therefore producing 500 would be genius, that would also be pretty bad.  I&#x27;m also not making any moral or ethical or environmental value judgement about manufacturing cars.<p>Its basically the economic broken window fallacy.<p>Another way to look at it, is if you know about control system theory, taking an unstable system and pushing it hard in an even more unstable direction is not going to work well.<p>WRT the Korean example, as a cheap hobby or time filling past time, there&#x27;s nothing inherently wrong with education, it didn&#x27;t hold them back as far as I know.  Nobody was spending money on liberal arts professors instead of spending the same money on welding robots and conveyor belts.  Not that there&#x27;s anything wrong with the liberal arts and making life worth living, just that it is orthogonal to economic productivity.",1386184101

If people would have said “there are minor inconsistencies, but Scala has a grand vision it focuses on and that&#x27;s what counts” you would have turned around and argued that it&#x27;s the lack of attention to detail which makes everything in Scala horrible.<p>Sorry, but I have seen how you do this more than I care to count already. It gets tiring and embarrassing to read.<p>People have tried to tell you that “making up facts to retroactively fit your opinions” is not a good thing and then you just do it again:<p>> I do not dispute that Scala&#x27;s features are well integrated in the compiler.<p>Let&#x27;s just ignore the way you try to derail the debate here and move the goalposts around for a minute, because probably everyone who has spent 5 minutes to look at the actual source code realizes how mind-boggling wrong this claim is.<p>The compiler goes to great lengths to catch all the weird corner cases and shield it&#x27;s users from inconsistencies which e. g. sometimes arise when running on a JVM or having to deal with other languages running on that platform.<p>Please have a look at javac, fsharpc and others. None of them come even close to effort scalac does to present its users with a consistent, coherent behaviour. They just let the user deal with all those minor annoyances.<p>> Scala never gives a compelling reason why it is so useful to mix different concepts in a single language and pay such a heavy price in complexity, other than &quot;sometimes it&#x27;s better to use one and sometimes another&quot;. That&#x27;s not a hallmark of great design.<p>Sorry, you mentioned it yourself already that your mainly interested in a language which dresses up Java&#x27;s minor pain points. I can understand that when coming from that point of view trying to understand the reason why Scala does things in a certain way is not interesting. But you should at least differentiate between “there is no reason” and “I didn&#x27;t care enough to look for the reason”.<p>> What big software development problem (as opposed to a PL research problem) does Scala solve?<p>- Abstraction and code maintenance: In all languages, you can arrive at a certain point where refactoring/abstracting things any further (to increase readability, maintainability, modularity) doesn&#x27;t add more value than it costs. The difference is that in Scala you are the one who can make this decision, not the compiler. This is a huge advantage, which can&#x27;t be understated, but is also hard to describe if you haven&#x27;t seen it yourself.  Dropping into an unknown code base and being able to be positive that changing/fixing/modifying one item involves touching one place, instead of possibly dozens or hundreds of pieces of code, is a considerable benefit.\n(Not really related to this, but implicit classes are an interesting example of how lots of code maintenance issues are made impossible by design, when compared to inferior approaches like extension methods.)<p>- Long-term evolution and extensibility: Scala gives you lots of options and tools to evolve your code in a way which minimizes the impact on the consumers of your code. Have a look at how Scala doesn&#x27;t expose any public fields in classes, how easy ensuring binary compatibility is with tools like the Migration Manager, have a look how typeclasses enable you to design your code with extension points in mind right from the start, have a look how @deprecated and friends allow you to have meaningful transitions between old and new code if necessary. This reduces the amount of technical debt accumulated over a period of time and makes it easy to keep existing code bases up to the changing/growing requirements of the real world.<p>- Closing the decade-old gap between data inside and data outside of a language: Type providers go a huge step toward a state where developers can just stop worrying whether their data is in the source code of their language, inside a database, stored in an XML file, or wherever else. This will be a huge productivity boost to all developers.",1386183671

These problems are also very silly. But I can confidently state that every math problem has some words and numbers and you are expected to perform some kind of calculation with the numbers based on the words around them.<p>The problem I see right now doesn&#x27;t have an immediate connection between the statement and the question parts. I have the numbers 125 and 5 and the question &quot;how old is the shepherd?&quot;. I can see that the answer must be a person&#x27;s age. The numbers refer to how many sheep and how many dogs are in the flock, which isn&#x27;t really related to the shepherd&#x27;s age. Still, there&#x27;s probably some lateral thinking involved, or there&#x27;s an omission, because I must obviously answer with a number.<p>If I add, subtract or multiply the two numbers in any order, I do not get a number that is plausible as a person&#x27;s age. However, if I divide them, I get 25, which is totally a possible answer.<p>25 is also the number of sheep per dog. Assuming that that&#x27;s a normal ratio for a flock, we can say that the shepherd&#x27;s flock contains 5 flock-units. So if the shepherd started at 17 years old (very plausible in a rural setting) and was given a new flock-unit every two years (obviously as you get older you get to take on more responsibility), at age 25 the amount of responsibility would have grown to 5 flock-units.<p>This answer has a nice symmetry to it. Math answers have some sort of nice symmetry in them, so this sounds plausible. With the information given I can do no better.<p>Answer: 25 years old.",1386183657

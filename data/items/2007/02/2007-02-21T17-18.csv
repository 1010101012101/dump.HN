348,comment,124,188,0,0,abstractbill,,,"I've been using the site for a few days now.  My feature requests involve getting rid of potential roadblocks:

Some kind of persistent cookie-based login would be nice.  Having to login each time I return to the site is annoying.

Larger default fonts.  Yes, I can change my browser's preferences and override your font size.  No, I don't want to have to do that for each of the browsers on each of the different computers I use throughout the day!

A longer username limit.  abstractnonsense wasn't allowed so I had to use abstractbill instead.  Not a big deal, but it did strike me as a rather small limit.

Overall though congrats on the site.  I've grown tired of reddit as it has moved away from its early demographic and this is just what I've been looking for.  Cheers.",1172080512

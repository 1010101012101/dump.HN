I think a lot of unix and open source people are a bit fanatically anti-microsoft, but the reality is most developers simply don't have the time to become an expert in both worlds.<p>I'm trying to move away from microsoft for a fairly simple economic reason:  licensing is is a pain in the ass.  Auditing software compliance is a legal hassle that eats time and money.  It's discouraging make-work.",1178804500

So learn some lisp to score brownie points and outsource a resume-filler project of your design to some cheep foreigners. You'll be ready to go.<p>As for hacking in general. The only way to learn is to create real programs. Books are a very small part of learning. I wouldn't recommend any.<p>Oh and don't tell the YC guys that you are hardly a hacker. They wont like that.",1178804153

I have a similar situation, however I have hacker friends that a) have too much holding them down from working on any projects, b) are comfortable with the 9-5 routine, or c) I just know that I can't work with them<p>I guess that is why I'm beginning to contribute here at news.yc, in hopes of meeting some technical folks who would be willing to start something down the road.<p>If you're looking for co-founders, I think you're in the right place",1178804126

Finding a hacker co-founder is a shortcut but it is not considered an answer here.<p>I want to have a full schedule, e.g. firstly read this book, finish all the exercise in it, then secondly you read a certain website, and so on, etc. Of course there will be no limit to learn, but I am asking for a minimum requirement.

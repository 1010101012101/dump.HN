Also, there have been many reports on which SD card is better for the model, so I didn&#x27;t just pick a random cheapest SD card. Your mileage varies.

He doesn&#x27;t compare random energies, instead he looks at what, under reasonably generous conditions, the daily power budget each energy source could provide per person. The very generous 20kWh/d of power per person is the key point. 6 m/sec is already high, with few places reaching such speeds consistently. And almost no one will reach double that, so you can look at an optimal 17 W/m^2 for wind. <a href=""http://web.stanford.edu/group/efmh/winds/global_winds.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://web.stanford.edu/group/efmh/winds/global_winds.html</a><p>In chapter 25, he acknowledges that while the cost of photovoltaics will fall, he does not see it doing so in a timeline that will be useful in terms of getting everything deployed for a ~2050 deadline. Economically speaking, carpeting deserts with concentrating collectors will be the cheaper of the solar options. The book is careful about doing all the math, citing all its sources and carefully explaining the scenarios it models. It is a very good book[+].<p>But cost is not the only issue—even as prices fall, there is still the problem of land use area. Efficiencies aren&#x27;t going to pass 30% (without going to much more expensive materials) and for mass production, we can halve that; cheap as panels may someday become, places with high pop densities (on top of seasonal variations/not being near the equator) are going to have trouble meeting their needs. Especially if they don&#x27;t want to get rid of their curling irons, hair/clothes dryers, toasters and electric stove/kettles. But panels/turbines aren&#x27;t the whole picture.<p>Already today, panels take up only a fraction of the cost of solar. You ideally, want an MPPT controller. You might need voltage regulators, you&#x27;ll need a rack for the panel and batteries, an appropriately sized inverter, wiring and installation. Batteries—to save more money long term—you want to oversize them so you rarely hit a low depth of discharge. But more batteries means more panels. You also want enough batteries such that you can wait out ~4 days of low light (speaking from experience, on cloudy days you can go the entire day at ~13% typical amp output). Even those at the equator will only get ~6 good hours of sunlight (~8 hours for an appreciable amount), so even for the best case scenario, 12 hours of storage per person is not going to cut it. Solar is great but it&#x27;s no panacea. And the math doesn&#x27;t work out for chemical energy storage. Molten salt storage, compressed air look to be more logical at the grid level but even they won&#x27;t be sufficient.<p>That said, Mr Theil is also incorrect to place Nuclear in opposition to renewables. Renewables will be in addition to Nuclear [-]. As well as looking into more DC appliances, more HVDC and working out circuit breakers for them, optimal manufacturing layouts such that &#x27;waste output&#x27; can be redirected to where it is needed. More energy efficient devices, energy routing algorithms (and a global grid of superconducting HVDC while we&#x27;re at it—seems far fetched but still at a much higher technological readiness level when compared to fusion), better city planning, climate control with geothermal heatpumps, more material reclamation and recycling, nuclear waste as fuel, carbon capture, extracting CO2 from the ocean for fuel and a cultural move away from an over consuming disposable society.<p>[+] I am biased in that I&#x27;d already known the author for one of the best free books on information theory and machine learning. Anyone interested in the link between learning, energy and thermodynamics should see this book as a starting point. <a href=""http://www.inference.phy.cam.ac.uk/itprnn/book.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.inference.phy.cam.ac.uk/itprnn/book.pdf</a><p>[-] Ch. 24 of sewtha.pdf goes into numeric data backed detail on why most build out, waste, cost arguments against nuclear are weak.

You have to get an SD card, power adapter and an HDMI. Tons of people still run DVI or VGA. If you have a monitor without HDMI you are fucked so you have to buy a converter.

See this writeup on sleepypi, an expansion-board that does just that:[2]  So it should be possible to wake on demand by powering up and going through a boot cycle.  Since the hardware is SO very fixed (not going to change short of ripping parts of the board off) I wonder why the boot time couldn&#x27;t be further reduced...what really takes 10 seconds, during which the SD card could have read 200 MB or so?  It&#x27;s nearly enough time to wake from hibernation, were that supported.  (SD card bus speed is limited to reading 20 MB/second or so).

Google&#x27;s recruiter contacted me couple months ago for a pretty interesting job position. I passed the phone interview and are preparing for the upcoming onsite. But I am now concerned about how my pregnancy could affect the interview.<p>Personally I don&#x27;t think pregnancy can affect my work much: I had a baby during PhD, which I believe was more tough than work. But I made it through with on-time project deliveries and publications.<p>However, I haven&#x27;t worked long in industry, so not much sure about the current situation. Should I hide or tell them that I am pregnant? Should I use my PhD experience to show pregnancy won&#x27;t affect much? Or should I interview at all when pregnant?",1448752083

I find this other person difficult to talk to.<p>This may be a bigger part of the problem than you realise. It&#x27;s incredible how much working with the right people helps. Consider working for a company that can offer you a <i>slightly</i> bigger team. Then at least you can choose who to have lunch with, or even choose who you get to work with.<p>I&#x27;m a mostly-Python programmer too. One thing I like is that we work on a large-scale long-term product (as opposed to numerous short-term client projects.) If you&#x27;re doing the same thing over and over for different clients you may get sick of it. (YMMV, I hear some people love starting from scratch every 3 months!)<p>> I don&#x27;t know if I&#x27;m an A-level programmer that could get a job somewhere else.<p>Do some interviews and find out? Job markets for programmers who are good at picking things up are still pretty wide, especially if you have the flexibility to move. Especially if you know some slightly-niche technologies you&#x27;re probably more in demand than you know. Come to NZ and work for us :)",1448752060

First and foremost, in Italy we dub our movies so well, the dubbing itself could be considered a mastered art. \nWe really like our dub actors. George Clooney, in Italy, has a very specific voice, for example, and that&#x27;s the voice of Francesco Pannofino. \nThat&#x27;s so bad that when you hear the same actor dubbed by someone else, you feel like something&#x27;s out of place in the movie. \nItaly has a very strong history of good Cinema, we&#x27;re still quite proud of that. \nOn top of it all, English in school is definitively not taught enough. \nMy English, for example, comes from American songs and videogames.",1448751906

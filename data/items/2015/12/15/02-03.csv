10735627,comment,10730420,10735529,0,0,adrtessier,,,"I agree with you 100% that Tor has its problems, and that it is a research project. It is not, and I do not believe it is, a panacea for strong anonymity on the web, and it is not intended to provide protection against a lot of things people think Tor provides protection from.<p>However, I disagree with your statement that Tor is not worth continued support. Even with its imperfections, I believe the Tor Project community is still working toward useful and productive goals on anonymity research, and is still a flagship of that to the greater public that is interested in protecting their privacy online. Maintaining a basic level of support for these ideals is parallel to Tor, but Tor in many ways is also a representative outlet for them.<p>Regardless of Tor&#x27;s actual effectiveness, Tor&#x27;s current profile is likely to make it the first anonymity tool of its kind to get attacked in the courts, especially if someone can do more than pretend there is a link between Tor and Islamic terrorism. How the Tor Project handles the litigation and political process that will stem from this heat will probably set case law, and with it court precedent, for other anonymity tools that come in its future. In that regard, Tor could become the PGP of the so-called second crypto wars.",1450148354

10735617,comment,10724460,10728979,0,0,y0y,,,"It&#x27;s not really a spectrum but a collection of symptoms whereby if one exhibits many or the majority of them in enough frequency, intensity, and duration as to negatively impact their life, one can say to be ADHD.<p>There are different subtypes (not sure if they are in the DSM but they are often referred to in other literature), e.g. hyperactive vs non-hyperactive. Sometimes, though, the hyperactivity exhibits itself in ways that are non-obvious.<p>I think the negative stigma comes from what many (myself, included) believe to be an over-diagnosis in young children. It seems to be used as a catch-all for children who are difficult to handle, who aren&#x27;t good at sitting still in class, etc. This over-diagnosis causes a lot of people to think the disorder isn&#x27;t real.<p>Secondly, a lot of people will try to fake their way into an ADHD diagnosis (especially at the college-level) to gain access to the amphetamines. This makes it difficult for those with the actual disorder, as we are scrutinized heavily and often made to feel somewhat criminal when we pick up our prescriptions at pharmacies that have had issues with this in the past. I won&#x27;t say it&#x27;s overly common, but it does happen. I&#x27;ve been told they were out of stock before because I tried dropping off a prescription at 3am once. I had it in my wallet and had meant to drop it off on my way out with friends. On my way home, the subway stop I get off at (I live in NYC) is where my 24/7 pharmacy is. I didn&#x27;t think anything of it, I&#x27;m just dropping it off to save myself a trip in the morning.. well, the pharmacist looked at me.. 3am, clearly had a few drinks.. and he gave me the &quot;we&#x27;re out of stock&quot; line. Magically it was re-stocked at 7am.<p>And lastly, there is a stigma in the US, in general, when it comes to mental illness. These aren&#x27;t things people can see, for one. And, perhaps more importantly, our mental selves are what we view as our <i>actual</i> selves, so people can have a hard time admitting to themselves that they have something about their mind that is considered abnormal. Other people have a hard time accepting it because they simply can&#x27;t relate - how do you explain to someone what it&#x27;s like to be ADHD?<p>You might tell them that you forget things a lot, feel impulsive, etc. and they simply say &quot;Yeah, everyone is like that though, you just need some discipline and will power dude.&quot; What they fail to recognize is that, yes, everyone does feel that way sometimes. Just like everyone feels anxious sometimes. What makes it a disorder is the frequency, intensity, and duration of the feeling(s). Many people just can&#x27;t accept this, especially in the US it appears. Our attitude is &quot;pick yourself up by the bootstraps&quot; or &quot;be a man&quot; or &quot;put yourself together - no one&#x27;s gonna do it for you. <i>I</i> certainly didn&#x27;t need medication!&quot; and there&#x27;s a lack of empathy because they simply <i>can&#x27;t</i> understand.",1450148177

I&#x27;m fully in agreement with your analysis and am a huge proponent of free markets solving health care in the US.<p>One striking area you can see the difference in the US is in elective surgeries -- for example cosmetic surgeries and Lasik surgeries.

But something puzzled me, and I couldn’t find an answer in any of the textbooks I looked at: how was I supposed to schedule the collections? In a classic description of a garbage collector, you wait until memory runs out and then you collect the world. But this leads to bad behaviour on modern systems, because of swapping, and because other processes need memory too. You need to schedule collections well before memory is full. But when exactly? I still don’t know of a comprehensive solution to this problem.</i><p>In a nutshell, you let your run-time pretend that it&#x27;s running in a small machine, until it is too close to huffing and puffing too hard and then you say &quot;hey I lied, you&#x27;re actually in a bigger machine: have some breathing room&quot;. This rubbery constraint keeps it behaving reasonably nicely, rather than &quot;Wee, I have 4GB of free RAM to stomp over with strings and cons cells before ever calling GC!&quot;<p>What you have to do is pick some heap size (that is typically substantially smaller than the amount of RAM). You let the GC whack against this artificial threshold, and if that gets too excessive, according to some measure, you increase it. E.g. if after a full GC you have less than some fudge threshold free, call the OS for more memory to integrate into the object heap.<p>The threshold is calculated in some way that the image doesn&#x27;t have to execute numerous frequent GC&#x27;s before it triggers the request for more space (it doesn&#x27;t have to whack too hard and wastefully against the artificial limit).<p>Also, ephemeral GC will help, and ephemeral GC can have its own threshold against frequent ephemeral GC&#x27;s.  When not enough space is liberated by ephemeral, you schedule a full. Then if <i>that</i> doesn&#x27;t liberate enough space, add more. Since ephemeral is fast (doesn&#x27;t scan the full heap), you can work a bit closer to the heap limit (since you can suffer frequent ephemeral GC&#x27;s better than frequent full GC&#x27;s).<p>And, of course, the parameters controlling these behaviors are exposed in some way so users can tweak them.

If you remember the &#x27;80s and the &#x27;90s and the early to mid aughts, there was a joke about how &quot;what Intel gives, Microsoft takes away&quot;  -  the idea was that every few years, you needed to buy a new and dramatically faster PC to do exactly the same sorts of things you would do before.   This PC would be massively faster than the last one you bought, and it would probably cost a little bit less.   Microsoft would come up with a new version of windows or office that you needed to upgrade to if you wanted to be able to open documents from other people in the office, and that new version would require a new and much more powerful computer.  Especially by the &#x27;90s, a lot of times these software upgrades felt really pointless, like your stuff was getting slower, but you didn&#x27;t get any better features.<p>Around the time that everyone quit writing PC software and focused on the mobile bonanza, as you put it, this seemed to stop.

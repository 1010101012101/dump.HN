Not really to auto-delete cookies (it does that), but because if you have a history of websites and you start typing in the address bar, it attempts to auto-complete the URIs, which freezes Safari for a second, and delays keyboard inputting. Apple doesn't have a time-delay of 1-2 seconds after the previous keystroke, so its auto-complete is really annoying and slows down/breaks the UI. Bookmarks have to be empty too to work.<p>That said, private-mode iOS Safari crashes a whole lot more than non-private mode. This usually happens on newspaper websites (UI hell) when all of the ad network and javascript widget garbage attempt to load. If you hit Stop-Loading after the article text is loaded, but before that other crap does, it fixes the problem. Funny, but disabling Javascript seems to crash more than leaving it on, but on different websites, likely for different reasons.",1330174301

After all, math is just formalized, applied rational thinking.",1330172276

The UK military were severely stretched last time around and given the changes in defence spending a repeat operation might not be possible.<p>The main point is that I think the wind of change is blowing against the UK on this one. It will take a concerted effort to counter the diplomatic push by Argentina and it is not clear that the politicians, despite the obvious emotive issues surrounding the territory both in the UK and in the Falklands, have a clear long term plan.<p>Update: Look to the recent conflict in Libya as a guide. The UK had considerable difficulty mounting an operation at Europe's back door. At a distance of 8,000+ miles the problems are multiplied many times over.",1330171433

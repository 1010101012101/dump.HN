Essentially, you have reporters who are looking for leads / sources, about a wide range of topics. Obviously, you're going to have a lot of ""Jon & Kate + 8"" and ""fashion week"" requests, but you occasionally get topics that deal with your area of expertise. You can then step in, and you get free exposure, in some fairly high-profile media outlets, and are quoted as an expert. Even the interviews that aren't in super-high-profile papers still give you a good chance to refine your pitch and to practice speaking to a non-technical reporter, so you've got a more polished presentation when it comes time to chat with the WSJ/NYT/etc.<p>So there's that.<p>BUT.<p>You might want to consider holding off on doing any publicity until, as zaidf mentions, you've ensured that you have a good product/market fit. In addition to Eric Ries and Sean Ellis, check out Steve Blank's stuff. If he were your advisor, and he heard you were looking to spend runway money on PR, he'd be apoplectic. He'd probably say that the best return on that money is going to come from doing user testing (that is, interviewing people to see if you have a product that they'd spend money on; if not, using the money to tweak the product, and then do another round of interviews; repeat), or from using it to extend your runway so you have longer to figure everything out before you run out of money.",1255132425

You are visually modelling program FLOW - something that is hard to visualize by just looking at text.<p>I went to Virginia Tech and since the CS department was sucked into the rest of engineering - I ended up taking intro engineering courses (read: a complete waste of time) and they wanted to teach programming to freshman engineers through Alice.<p>Alice, although the early versions crashed, ran slow, and often saved the XML 'world' files incorrectly, corrupting your work and making you lose it - it did a great job of teaching visual programming because you could easily create a 3D scene or game without much effort, plus it highlighted the code as it ran.<p>While Wizbang is visual as well (albeit in a different way), the program flow diagrams kind of look like UML diagrams and could STILL scare away novice programmers.<p>A main issue of teaching programming to new comers is you need to start with the basics - but printing ""hello world"" to the screen doesn't seem applicable so it feels like they are wasting their time. Besides, most of what they use computers for is pretty and visual.<p>Wizbang doesn't seem to offer anything else that other learning tools don't do in a better way - except maybe the export to a ""real"" language.<p>Now imagine if you could combine that exporting functionality on top of something more visually interesting like Alice. Make a 'game' in Wizlice (Wizbang-Alice), and then export that code (on top of your minimal graphics libraries or functions to support what they write) to C++/Java and let them tinker around with THAT... they'll be on HN in a couple of years tops.<p>Cool idea, polished effort, please expand visual component!",1255131576

Then you look at the results...these inspiring places are only producing incremental gains.<p>That's because a large percent of people (and a HUGE percent of folks who are drawn into the non-profit world) care more about how much they care, and how hard they work, than they do about what they accomplish.<p>In that world, measuring and comparing two programs against each other are both unacceptable things to do.<p>There's a reason that ""New Math"" and ""Whole Language Reading"" have persisted in the schools for decades, despite their demonstrable failure.<p>There's a reason that the DARE program is still running decades later, despite the fact that it has no results.<p>There's a reason that all politicians love Head Start, even though all effects dissipate a few years after the program graduates a child.<p>There's no profit motive in this world, and there's no mindset of measurement and continuous improvement.<p>Go read some of Phil Greenspun's posts on how frustrating it is to try to work with non-profits.<p>They don't want results; they want to build empires, and <i>feel</i> like they are doing something.",1241791091

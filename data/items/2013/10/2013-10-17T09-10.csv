Even in the silicon valley there is a trend towards more sustainable growth models as the hundreds of SaaS startups here on HN would testify.<p>Being a really open and relaxed city with a high quality of life, Berlin stands a good chance of attracting talent, allowing them to try out their ideas and hopefully create an IPO or two in the next ten years.

6564393,comment,6564121,6564375,14,0,Xylakant,,,"> Companies are for making money<p>Smart companies realize that their profits do not exist in a vacuum. In Germany it&#x27;s a long standing view that capitalism must be balanced and that companies have a social function in society and must act accordingly. This is one of the secret powers of what we call &quot;Mittelstand&quot; which employs the majority of people in Germany and produces a huge share of the social product. Those companies are often family owned and pride themselves in taking good care of their workforce - a trait that often pays off when times are turning worse since the employees reward good treatment with loyalty. It&#x27;s not uncommon for a complete workforce to accept pay cuts across the board instead of firing people which in turn allows the company to keep well trained and educated workers on the payroll until things get better. Both sides profit here.<p>So yes, companies are for making money, but smart companies think further than next years profit statement.",1382003713

Shut down the master, and as soon as the master stopped responding, haproxy would shove clients to the slave in the new data centre instead.

For instance, at the very least, you could&#x27;ve instead asked, <i>&quot;Are you proposing that the state should wither away? Do you think the only other way food can be provided is by it trickling down?&quot;</i><p>That would&#x27;ve still been a leap to conclusion from what I said, or possibly display a lack of understanding of what I said, but at least it&#x27;d be your <i>asking</i>.<p>I would&#x27;ve asked you to elaborate on what you mean by a state withering away. There&#x27;s a difference between social safety nets in the context of free choice vs. involuntary constraint. There&#x27;s a difference between &quot;the state&quot; at present vs. how &quot;the state&quot; can be reformed to justify itself to more humane roles. Finding major faults with [current state systems] is not the same thing as believing [all state systems] must vanish. I would&#x27;ve explained how I&#x27;m an advocate of peaceful, open systems wherever the public&#x27;s trust is at stake. Territorial systems can have net positives in certain domains, such as in violent crime. However, the current system of US criminal law/code is devastatingly unethical. (I find nothing ethical about imprisoning human beings for nonviolent crime, especially when it&#x27;s a state serving corporate law.) At best, the US system is a stepping stone best understood in historical context, for people of good conscience to step above on a path to something better.<p>I would&#x27;ve wondered why you&#x27;re implying that the alternative to food stamps is food &quot;trickling down&quot; [from the rich]. The status quo of US taxation is very akin to &quot;trickle-down&quot; economics. Mass forced funding of a public -> flows into centralized pools governed by small bodies who have the capacity to serve personal, secret, and corporate interests in often closed contracts and closed courts -> devaluing and siphoning value and labor -> distributed fractionally to a public that waits for crumbs to flow back (hopefully) to people in need, pennies to the dollar. It&#x27;s one of many forms of trickle down economics; it&#x27;s a form that happens to overlook a great amount violence and corruption of the system by increasingly putting society at the mercy of the system. Nationalists, large corporations, prison systems, and warmongers love it though. The answer to your non-question here is that what I want society to aspire to is ultimately neither approaches -- for both are violent and narrow. We can do better. My aspiration for a freer, more peaceful society is not a switch I can flip on and off. It does, however, start with at least promoting peace and benevolence in <i>culture,</i> for people to begin to aspire to social problems solved by more directly open, fuller democratic (when democratic), voluntary, consensus-based models. Where there are pooled resources, I prefer that they be within a transparency that&#x27;s more likely to arise when people are able to revoke funding, disassociate, and take part in reformation. The ability to assemble and disassemble is one area where a state can play a greater role in: preventing people from suffering the tyranny <i>of</i> involuntary systems.<p>My views are not binary. Presume nothing. I <i>ethically value</i> systems that cut out corrupt interests and increase free choice. I like <i>more</i> bottom-up solutions. It requires time. I choose to be a part of increasing the amount of social support on an ethical, voluntary basis by showing people that their actions can have definitive, accountable results and real-world feedback. I strive for a continued cultural shift in how people can empower themselves. Nothing happens overnight. Like I said, I don&#x27;t want to flip any switches on people most in need.<p>I want peaceful evolution.<p>Most of my time is focused tirelessly on a project in this area. I hope to someday help people act upon their better and freer instincts. The least of what I can say from my observations so far is the following. People are far more generous and kinder than most people can imagine. Love and social compulsion is deeply rooted even in this violent species that we are. Action, input, and output are <i>severely</i> dependent on access, information, awareness, and the architectures that form transparency and accountability. True change is best predicated on attitude and culture. Change happens most meaningfully when it&#x27;s natural: not shaped through dictation. The systems of governance that exist today are neither the end nor the beginning of answering a timeless call to some people who want freer, happier lives for themselves and for the world.

Walmart.com continues to just flail in the wind. That means they&#x27;re going to end up with a monster position that can&#x27;t be assaulted in the next decade.

It started out talking about how mobile people in the U.S. were for moving to where jobs are and then moved to making a case that people don&#x27;t move to places with high housing costs.<p>The U.S. is a big place and locations with crazy housing costs are not the norm. I would think that most people moving for a job would already have a job available. I suppose there are plenty of cases where people might move without a job offer in advance because anything would be an improvement.<p>Maybe today people don&#x27;t move as often simply because EVERYTHING is getting more expensive while the jobs people could land are staying the same or getting worse. Moving is quite expensive, especially when you don&#x27;t have a job and especially when you don&#x27;t have a job lined up at the place you are moving to. Gas is expensive for moving long distances. Getting into a house or an apartment is expensive. How many jobless people have the savings to withstand all this?<p>It would also be interesting to see more statistics. For example, where were people moving to and from when the rates were the highest? What industries were supporting the places these people moved to? Maybe the decline of jobs that could take just about anyone, in large numbers and paid well (manufacturing) contributed to the decline in mobility. There really isn&#x27;t anything which could take the place of engineering.<p>Though people may be less mobile today, the options for that mobility will always be great. The U.S. is a huge nation with a lot of diversity. You can&#x27;t really compare mobility in a nation like the U.S. with 50 states to a small country like that of Denmark or Sweden.",1382001899

6564324,comment,6560214,6564211,4,0,pron,,,"> In my opinion, however, as I could gather from the writings of mr. Armstrong, (one of) the fundamental problem with JVM is that it lacks a process isolation, and when it crashes, everything crashes completely. He explicitly pointed out this in his thesis - JVM cannot provide fault-tolerance due to being a mere user-level multi-thread process.<p>This is true in general, but not entirely accurate. When a Java thread crashes it doesn&#x27;t bring down the whole JVM any more than when an Erlang process does. Just the one thread dies. With Quasar you get the same isolation for fibers.<p>It is true, however, that one thread in Java could negatively impact the performance of another by triggering a GC, while in Erlang each process has its own private heap. The Erlang approach (or the BEAM approach, rather, as its a feature of the VM - not the language) provides this isolation because Erlang was designed for systems where fault-tolerance is the number one concern. But it has its cost, too. The lack of a global heap makes it impossible to implement useful shared data structures, so Erlang provides some simple shared data-structures (like ETS) implemented in C, but those aren&#x27;t garbage collected.<p>Also, the JVM has a big performance advantage over BEAM. That&#x27;s why quite a few Erlang projects need to code some performance critical functions in C. But once you do that, you lose Erlang&#x27;s isolation guarantees: a failed C function could bring down the entire application, and one that&#x27;s stuck in an infinite loop <i>will affect</i> the performance of other processes.<p>> I am also not quite sure about any superior concurrency constructs which aren&#x27;t based on OS primitives, but I am not Java guy.<p>You can start by looking here: <a href=""http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/concurrent/package-summary.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/concurren...</a><p>None of these classes uses kernel mutexes or other synchronization mechanisms.",1382001687

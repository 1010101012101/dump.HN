I&#x27;m guessing a lot of early servers&#x27; lower layers like OS, webserver, etc. were proprietary; convincing the vendor to support x86 would have been a hard sell; and porting your application to an x86 environment was difficult.<p>All of these things would have had a tendency to lock people into their existing hosting choices.<p>Nowadays most servers run mostly / completely FOSS (at the lower layers) that can be easily ported to ARM.  I&#x27;d imagine porting code to x86 from VAX or DEC or mainframe or whatever, was a lot more painful than porting PHP, Django or Ruby web apps to ARM today.<p>Of course, Intel <i>does</i> have deeper pockets and much of the desktop market, and may well be able to use that to keep ARM in check despite the fact that switching CPU architectures is probably much easier for website owners today than it was when Intel was trying to break into the server market.",1390981189

7142525,comment,7141908,7141963,36,0,andrewfong,,,"The lack of an independent invention defense (or some variation of this) is pretty much 80% of what&#x27;s wrong with patent law in my opinion. A sampling of the issues an independent invention addresses:<p>* Obviousness. Patents are required to be non-obvious to a &quot;person holding ordinary skill in the art&quot;, but obviousness is highly subjective and difficult to assess (especially for a non-technical jury). In contrast, evaluating whether something was independently invented, while not necessarily simple, is a more objective test.<p>* Utility.  One of the rationales behind the patent system is that we want to encourage inventors to share their ideas with the world instead of just keeping them secret for as long as possible. While the patent system requires publication of the invention, it doesn&#x27;t require publication in a manner that&#x27;s particularly useful. If you could only assert patents against people actually using them, then you would have a strong incentive to make them useful (e.g. source code).<p>* Supply and Demand. The current system grants a flat 20 years to each patented invention, regardless of how difficult or expensive it was to invent. Recognizing independent invention creates the opportunity for a more flexible system. Inventions that are hard to reproduce independently are more valuable to society and should enjoy a longer term than easier ones.<p>The obvious problem with all of the above of course is how feasible it is to assess whether something was invented &quot;independently&quot;. I&#x27;ve addressed that to some degree in this blog post (<a href=""http://www.techdirt.com/articles/20121011/14171220681/yes-independent-invention-defense-patents-is-completely-feasible.shtml"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.techdirt.com/articles/20121011/14171220681/yes-in...</a>), but I admit it&#x27;s a hard problem.<p>EDIT: Typos",1390980872

You fix those, and discuss some more.  Eventually, you, the mailing list and the implementers will be happy with the standard, at which point you move to have the RFC published as an official RFC.<p>Anyhow, this is all for a “Standard track” RFC.

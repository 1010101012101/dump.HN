103353,comment,103335,103339,0,0,Leon,,,"The article seems to suggest that there was no preference one way or the other previously, but that larger groups still up-voted stories together, which influenced the diversity of the site towards them more than was wanted by everyone.<p>For example, there is a strong ron paul supporting group of people that use that site, and their voice is drowning out the rest of the audience.  A few hundred vocal ron paul supporters are all that are needed to over influence the thousands+ that visit the site.  Now it sounds like they're checking for diversity of friend groups to ensure that the most popular stories are the stories most popular amongst the most diverse amount of people will float to the top.<p>Then again this is all speculation, and I still think it could be a better algorithm.<p>As for the worries of the Drill Down show, there will probably always be problems with spammers and fraudulent stories on social sites like that, it's just a race of AI development on both sides of the site.",1201157855

The questions were added in selected countries representing diverse size and income in Asia, the Middle East, South East Asia, Europe, North America and South America. Representative samples of adults between 18 and 64 years old were asked if, over the next six months, they were likely to buy products or services new to the market, they were likely to try products or services that use new technologies for the first time, and whether new products and services will improve their lives.</i><p>That last sentence is crucial.  If I had to explain the results I wouldn't say people over 40 have less confidence in innovation.  I'd suspect that they have a better understanding of the things in life that do matter to them and can be more selective in their choice of innovation.",1201155924

5291057,comment,5285101,5290114,2,0,chipsy,,,"JPEG artifacts are unrelated to the definition of pixels. They're an artifact of using lossy compression, much as how MP3 exhibits some distinctive artifacts at lower bitrates. Monty is only talking about plain old uncompressed sampled data.<p>Since you're focused on the ""size of a pixel"" you might also be thinking of resampling artifacts, which is also beyond the scope of the video. Resampling is the process of changing the effective sample rate of data by reconstructing a new, larger or smaller set of samples from the original data. Monty alludes to this when he says ""the samples are not stairstepped"", because when we go to reconstruct samples we have to figure out a method that is NOT stairstepped, but rather:<p>1. Reasonably represents the original signal\n2. Remains band-limited<p>Fortunately there's theory that explains what a mathematically ideal resampler should look like. It's good study material for thinking about sampling theory in more depth and understanding some outcomes that develop from defining samples as infinitely small points. It also explains why pixel art doesn't respond well to standard image resampling algorithms.",1361948036

5291053,comment,5289532,5290943,4,0,notlisted,,,"> I used the exact same application as you did. JPEGmini lite from the App Store. I'm not sure what could account for the discrepancies between our examples. As you mentioned, there's no possible parameters either of us could have changed.<p>I used the non-lite version (ie I paid for it). Version 1.4.2 to be exact (I see the latest version is 1.4.3). Not sure if the ""full"" and ""lite"" version are using different compression levels or algorithms. I do know that older versions had a much lower megapixel limit.<p>> I see no issue with zooming to demonstrate already visible compression artefacts.<p>I do, because that's the crux of the story. JPEGMini (and Beamr too I guess), provide VISUALLY similar results with smaller file size and with a minimum of effort required.<p>Loss of information is inherent to lossy compression. Achieving a file size reduction requires that sacrifices are made somewhere, typically by removing detail. The trick is making these sacrifices in the right places, so that before and after appear the same.<p>If the processed image is displayed at 800x600 on a monitor with 150DPI, one would make different choices/assumptions about what to sacrifice than if the resulting image is viewed at 300% magnification. JPEGMini's feat is making the right sacrifices (note that they do NOT change the compression method, the end result is a STANDARD jpeg file, not a special format).<p>> JPEG compression actually looks better on images with flat areas of color of gradient. This can be demonstrated by exporting an image in the format with and without a very slight gaussian blur added to the image. The results are typically a good deal smaller with the blur applied.<p>Correct, but photos are still very different from cartoons, vector graphics, text, etc (think: colors occurring in nature vs colors picked by a designer, inherent blurriness of large parts of a photo, very few hard edges in most photos, the human visual model - color, luminance vs chrominance, filling in the gaps etc etc).",1361947946

The low parts count of tablets makes them ideal low cost computers. The long battery life makes them perfect for use in areas without ubiquitous electrical power. And the intuitive touch based interfaces make them perfect for use even by people who aren't literate.

I'll be the first to bemoan Django for its flaws (it has many, as do all frameworks), but this is absurdly misguided thinking. There are <i>tons</i> of success stories to the contrary, with new ones adding to the pile every day.<p>> The argument to be made, then, is why that obligation and rigidity and bigness are valuable, which thus far, no one has really done.<p>I think you're missing the point entirely. Your claims of rigidity aren't applicable for everyone. For a very large number of users, Django doesn't <i>need</i> to be super de-duper modular/interchangeable (it's good enough for many/most). In fact, some people don't <i>want</i> the complexity of SQLAlchemy. Some don't even know/care what jinja is (I personally haven't felt the desire to switch to it, as I feel it has problems of its own).<p>Django is batteries included. Pyramid is not. These are two different approaches that each have tradeoffs.<p>> It's not necessarily Django's fault. Pyramid is a much later framework, and alternate implementations of pieces of the full stack like Jinja2, Mako and SQLAlchemy became mature after Django was initially conceived.<p>Again, not everyone <i>wants</i> these pieces you are talking about. While SQLAlchemy is a great piece of a software, it is a complex piece of software with a steeper learning curve than the simple Django ORM. There are plenty that don't need/want something as heavy duty as SQLAlchemy. In my case, if I need the absolute best performance or advanced features, <i>I am writing SQL</i> instead of dealing with <i>any</i> ORM that makes bad choices for me. More ORM is not attractive to me, I tend to dislike them for anything but the most simple cases (ie: the <i>basic</i> Django ORM operations).<p>That is where your blanket statement falls to tatters. Differing requirements, different priorities.<p>> I'm just saying, ""it's unwise"", for almost any large-scale new project.<p>And not all advice is created equally :) I'd say that it is appropriate for some large-scale projects and teams, and inappropriate for others.

They ""aim"" for the same quality in the video you feed them and try and optimize bitrate.  An example would be finding coefficients in a macroblock that could be further quantized without sacrificing perceived quality.  So to me it makes some sense though I can't put a number of what you could gain with this sort of secret sauce, that is how much is there to squeeze out of already well optimized videos that use other measures.  I would imagine the applying this secret sauce to the original video would be a better idea since quality measure is inherently something that depends on a reference.  Almost by definition any change to a compressed video is reducing its quality (but perhaps they ""reduce"" things you can't see).<p>Since this is about perception it's really hard to measure.

The main difference in all of these examples is the loss of CCD noise, which could be considered a good or bad thing depending on your aim.",1361945112

5290944,comment,5290132,5290772,2,0,rayiner,,,"I think it's actually the opposite. Academia is more divorced from industry in the computer science world than say the aerospace world. When I was working with grad students as an aerospace major, they were by and large working directly on problems relevant to industry. Most computer science research seems much more mathematical/theoretical than practical, in comparison. I think this is also a relatively recent phenomenon. Compare say Preston Brigg's thesis on graph coloring register allocation (1992) to Sebastian Hack's thesis on register allocation for SSA form programs (2007). The former I think was much more written with implementers in mind, and the latter has a lot more math and proofs (though it's more readable than a lot of CS papers these days, which can tend towards a dense maze of proofs and esoteric notation).<p>Indeed, I think there is a language barrier between CS academia and CS industry that doesn't exist between AE academia and AE industry. In aerospace, everyone speaks the language of differential equations, finite element analysis, computational fluid dynamics, etc. But CS academia is deeply steeped in type theory, automated proofs, etc, while CS industry talks about object orientation and test frameworks, etc.",1361944872

This can be demonstrated by exporting an image in the format with and without a very slight gaussian blur added to the image. The results are typically a good deal smaller with the blur applied.",1361944872

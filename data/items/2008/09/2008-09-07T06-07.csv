He suggested we get some white boards so we could collaborate with each other.<p>That suggestion was nixed by the ""office manager"" (secretary), because white boards didn't go with the office's decor.<p>I am not making this up.

297356,comment,297212,297212,0,0,jrockway,,,"It is all about who participates in the voting.  On Reddit (and Digg, I guess), the voting is done by retarded 9-year-old fanbois, and as a result, rewards ideas and comments that appeal to that demographic.  Highly rated comments there are often some of the worst material I've ever read in my life.  It often makes me pray for my own death.  Correspondingly, some good ideas and arguments are often downmodded to -10, even though they are fine comments.<p>Over here, it's not as bad.  I think the demographic here is the more thoughtful and secure type.  We realize that someone disagreeing doesn't invalidate your own opinion or beliefs; it's just something more to think about.  Plus, some especially bad comments are killed outright, which discourages future abuse.  (Most of the things that get killed here would be +1000 on Reddit, so you can see why things are different between the sites.)<p>And BTW, I usually don't get dowmodded here for having the ""wrong"" opinion here.  Sometimes I am shocked, like with this one:<p><a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=294691"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=294691</a><p>I swear, anywhere else that would have been downmodded to oblivion.  (Even though it is not a troll, I really think that.)  Instead, people replied disagreeing with me.  Excellent.<p>The system ain't broken yet.",1220770074

297353,comment,297212,297226,0,0,jrockway,,,"Every forum I've ever read is even worse than the social news sites.  When someone disagrees with you here, they reply with an argument.  It may not be a good argument, but at least the reply is related to what they disagree with.  On forums, people reply with things like ""I bet you wouldn't say that to my face."" instead of actually arguing the point.  This is completely worthless -- why have a discussion forum if you're not going to disagree?<p>On the Internet, you can argue unrelentingly for your point and not have it count against you socially.  In a casual conversation, someone who does nothing but argue their point would be ""annoying"", but on the Internet, that's not annoying.  It's the entire fucking point.  (And before the Internet, people wrote op-eds.  Rules for conversation and writing are different.  So don't ask me if I would say that to your face, because your face isn't here.)",1220769700

297347,comment,297297,297327,0,0,wheels,,,"The other important point, hit right up there at the front is:  desktop apps aren't going away anytime soon.<p>It's been a real ride for me coming back into the web world after about 6 years of working on enterprise and desktop apps.  Everyone in the web world seems to think we're just on the cusp of everything moving over to the web.  Which is pretty much what they were saying when I was working in web programming 7 years ago.  To the rest of the universe, desktop apps are still mainstays of day-to-day computing and while there is a shift, it's much more gradual than people in the web business seem to assume.<p>Amusingly, this phenomenon is not all that different from what folks working in the Linux desktop have been assuming since I got into that some 8 years ago:  that <i>this</i> is the year of the Linux desktop.  It's about to tip any day now...",1220769224

I don't understand 95% of the text of your site.  For instance:<p>""Portal Spy will change the way you think about your Vignette Portal platform.""<p>If you want me to read it, should be:<p>""Portal Spy will change the way you think about your Vignette Portal, the most popular BLAH BLAH, platform.""<p>Disclaimer #1 applies to me (I'm using FF3 on the mac.)  The animations are slow.  I hope for everyone else they're much, much faster.<p>In summary, your site looks nice, but i can't (from my lack of knowledge) understand what it does.   Skimming this post, i think my comments are of limited utility.  nevertheless, i'll post 'em.  good luck.",1220768350

In Dec '07 we had some soul-searching and radically changed our idea from an API (selling tickets) to a self-contained blogging widget.<p>We rebuilt the site and have been working with bloggers since the spring in an open beta. The public announcement could have come earlier -- we were mainly getting the pricing, billing & core feature set worked out (along with a rename -- BriteTix didn't make sense anymore).",1220768141
297339,comment,297297,297327,0,0,iamdave,,,"Well he also makes the good point that the web is pointlessly obfuscating everyday operations while balkanizing the end-user market at the same time.  Average users don't care if they can publish their resume online, they just want to do it.  If they use a web app, they use a web app.  In the end, they just want to get things done.<p>I think it's a solid article.",1220768075
297338,comment,297054,297302,0,0,kingkongrevenge,,,"I'm really not sure where you contradict me.  The subject was high volume body building style routines, and the merits of intensity over volume.  You don't seem to address this.  I guarantee you no fighter trains anything at all like a body builder.  The focus is on hand speed and explosive force.  It is an absolutely proven fact that high volume and emphasis on maximal force training compromises speed and endurance.  The low reps and plyometrics you mention have nothing to do with body building routines...<p>I don't think anyone would suggest 30 minutes twice a week would lead to overtraining.  That's a pretty good target, actually.  Most people trying to get fit sort of half ass it five days a week, though.  I'm not sure over-training is the right word, but they definitely spend way too much time training.<p>But as far as training 20 hours a week, that's far in excess of any health benefits, which was my point above with regard to not modeling on athletes.  Competition level training involves major oxidation and over nitrification stress.  Hormone profiles are messed up.  Pro and college level athletes are not doing their health any favors.<p>I will have to disagree with your claim that getting cut is necessarily about aerobic exercise.  Aerobics can certainly help, but another way lower fat is via boosted growth hormone.  That ""oh I'm going to puke"" feeling you get from brief intense training is surging growth hormone levels.  It makes you nauseous.  It also reconfigures your body to be lean.",1220767976

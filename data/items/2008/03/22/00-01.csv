Just because Safari is better than IE does not mean it is okay to push it on people - especially when most of the people are using iTunes only because they have an iPod and Apple pushed iTunes on them. (This is just an observation. I have absolutely no real evidence to back up this claim.)<p>I do tend to be an idealist though, and I think that everyone needs to take the high ground when pushing for change.",1206147504

It reads very well today and I'd recommend it to any professional.<p>I was particularly struck by this quote:<p>""I really don't know what I was looking for when I got back from the war, but it seemed as though all I could see was a lot of bright young men in grey flannel suits rushing around New York in a frantic parade to nowhere. They seemed to me to be pursuing neither ideals nor happiness -- they were pursuing a routine. For a long while I thought I was on the side lines watching the parade, and it was quite a shock to glance down and see that I too was wearing a grey flannel suit.""",1206145838

It was the\nfirst time I'd ever seen someone follow vectors through history\ninstead of recounting it one period at a time, like most books and\nclasses do.<p>Discovering Lisp was a big one.  This was in 1983, when the default\nprogramming language was Pascal.  Lisp seemed (and in retrospect\nwas) startlingly better.  There was no one single book or quotation,\nbut I remember how excited I was to get my hands on a photocopy\nof the InterLisp manual.<p>Kenneth Clark's documentary series <i>Civilisation</i> (and the accompanying\nbook) impressed me a lot.  In fact, it was clearly the model for\n<i>Connections</i>.  I've never read anything else better about art.   His ideas\nare extremely subversive, but few get it because he usually speaks\nin code. And he\nhad access to stuff like no one else ever will again.<p>I also learned a lot from his book <i>The Nude</i>.<p>One of the biggest influences on my ideas about startups was an\nessay by TJ Rogers, the CEO of Cypress Semiconductor.  I don't\nremember the title, but it cut through the usual corporate bullshit\nlike a knife.  For me the important thing was not just what he said,\nbut that one could even be that candid.<p>Of all the books I've read in the last 5 years or so, Hardy's <i>A\nMathematician's Apology</i> is probably the one that stuck most in my\nhead.",1206145085

Most real-world systems have a single constraint that limit the system's ability to achieve goal units. The best way to improve the system is to (0) define the system's owners and their goal for the system, (1) identify the constraint (2) improve the situation at the constraint in a way that does not require significant investment; (3) if the improvement resulting from the previous is not sufficient, decide how to improve the constraint in a way that does require significant investment; (4) subordinate everything else in the system to the decision arrived at in the previous step; (5) start over at step 1.<p>The Game, by Neil Strauss (<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0060554738"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0060554738</a>)",1206144997

Is it mostly a gut feeling about whether users will want the service or do they actually look at real-world data?<p>If a startup already has growing traffic, then that could be promising.  But what if it is not at that stage yet?

Bloggers in particular write about startups as if they were physical objects that are hard to change.  They make a big deal out of the launch date and whether the service has left beta as if these notions had much meaning.  They make predictions about whether a service is doomed without thinking too much about how it might evolve.<p>I suppose one can argue that bloggers simply reflect the views of users.  Since users don't think of a service as infinitely malleable (or perhaps don't want it to be since change requires learning), then bloggers just do the same so that their posts make sense to users.",1206144390

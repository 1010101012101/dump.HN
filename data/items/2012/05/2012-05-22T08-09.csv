Python+pygame is really popular for prototyping little game ideas, for instance.<p>I think the point about choosing Processing, for most people, is the simple and well-established path to do:<p>1 - graphic-oriented apps<p>2 - stuff that can run in the browser (although Java applets are a massive PITA, sadly, and are slowly but steadily being phased out)<p>3 - not much else (actual feature: the excess of choice is overwhelming for a beginner)<p>And then I have this concern that many students, when already proficient in an ""introductory language"" never quite find the motivation to jump to another language with significantly different structure and syntax. Since proficiency in an introductory language is achieved rather early, it becomes a dead end before they can develop a ""real taste"" for advanced programming. This has happened to a lot of people I know. Many of my friends started in the 80s with Sinclair BASIC or some other BASIC (C64, C128, Oric, MSX, etc). These have, for the most part, enough built-in graphic primitives to toy around a lot and make simple games with little experience, even with the limited hardware of the time. But then, the next step in order to overcome these nice but slow interpreters was usually assembly or complex compiled languages (usually proprietary implementations, expensive and with obscure support). So they stopped right there.<p>It's not so bad now but the wall is still there.",1337676879

Pressing a string to the fret completes an electrical circuit.  At first I thought the bridge had optical pickups based on the way it looked, but according to the description, the thing has <i>no</i> pickups.<p>There are some serious flaws with this design.<p>1) It looks like you can't bend strings, because the frets are divided into six segments.  The string would get caught between the segments.  If there's some kind of non-conductive bridge between the segments (unlikely), then it will probably wear differently.  If you can't do a whole-step bend, then there's an enormous volume of music you can't play.<p>2) It's going to sound like trash.  Without pickups, it has to synthesize the sound.  I've gotten usable sampled guitar tracks before, but I did that by recording samples specifically for the song and manually tweaking each note.<p>3) It's unnecessary.  You could basically take a stock Stratocaster, add a hex pickup and a LED neck, and you're done.  The LED neck isn't easy, and of course it won't sound like a normal neck, but whatever.  The guitar will still be a normal usable guitar.<p>If you want to divide guitar players into rhythm/lead and acoustic/electric, it becomes clear that this is a usable instrument in none of these four categories.  Electric rhythm guitar strongly relies on palm-muting technique which you won't be able to learn without regular pickups.  For electric lead, you need the whole-note bend and left-hand vibrato technique.  The bend is impossible and the vibrato can't be taught without the pickup.  Acoustic players want to be able to play and hang out with friends but the synth is just going to get in the way.  You see the picture of that guy at the park with three friends (of course the two sitting next to him are girls)?  He would probably be happier with an acoustic.  Furthermore, if you learn on this guitar you'll be fairly hopeless on an acoustic since the strings are heavier (if you play electric and switch to acoustic, your left hand will give out fairly quick).<p>Incidentally, I paid about $330 for my first guitar, a Fender Stratocaster, plus amp.  It's more like $400 with inflation since 2003.  Never had lessons but it sure ain't hard to figure out ""Smoke on the Water"" or ""Smells Like Teen Spirit"".",1337674202

If I want to just play some tunes, or a video from my laptop on someone else's PC or set top, how trivial is it?   Not very.  At least not for the mythical average user.<p>A decentralised web sounds good to me also.  And lowering the barriers to web publishing where you have control over the content in my eyes is a good thing.<p>Unite though feels like a component that could live happily outside of the browser (again ideally in the OS layer).  The email client could be standalone also.  Unless they want to go the Chrome OS way.",1337674062

4006794,comment,4005224,4006240,6,0,swombat,,,"FYI, for the last 6 months I've cut out major sources of carbs. No rice, pasta, bread or potatoes, and no obviously super-sweet stuff (sugar, sodas, etc), and very sweet fruits (apples, cherries, pineapples, grapes...) only in moderation.<p>I still drink beer. I make occasional exceptions (been eating some chocolate every couple of days recently since someone gifted me a whole damn box). I eat <i>lots</i> of veg (salads, spinach, peppers, tomatoes, cucumbers, etc) and huge amounts of meat (anything from fresh steak and home-made burgers - no bun - to chorizo, Parma ham, and other fatty meats). I still eat lots of dairy products too - cheese in particular, nice mozzarella, Camembert, gruyere, emental, etc.<p>Result for me? I eat whenever I'm hungry, however much I feel like, and always nice food that tastes good, and my weight hasn't budged. I also don't get the 1-3pm carb coma anymore. And I feel great.<p>YMMV, but this works for me for maintaining weight. For cutting down weight, just combine this with a calorie restriction method and daily weight measurements/charting, as per : <a href=""http://danieltenner.com/posts/0018-how-to-lose-weight.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://danieltenner.com/posts/0018-how-to-lose-weight.html</a>",1337673797

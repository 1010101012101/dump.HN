BB is not standing still by any means.<p>The flipside is, most of the money managed by firms is not handled over Bloomberg nor is Bloomberg the final point of analysis before trades are made. For example one group at my old firm (in fixed income) used a custom built set of tools on top of excel connected directly to their own bare metal sitting on the floors of all the exchanges where they traded contracts. They pulled in their own prices at their own frequency (which was much faster/accurate than available via Bloomberg). Same was true in our group - data came from the exchanges (though with not as custom/frequent a setup), and bloomberg was used as a quick and dirty way to look up historicals/trends, rather than anything live.<p>More recently I&#x27;ve thought the best attack vector is messaging. There isn&#x27;t a Bloomberg messaging app on the appstore. Of all the use cases, this is the most irreplaceable - you can probably pay up for all the data flows (banks all pay exchanges directly for higher fidelity data flows than Bloomberg provides) but aggregating that 500k odd userbase of finance professionals? INSANELY HARD. If Bloomberg had an API though . . .",1395269849

7432452,comment,7429058,7432182,7,0,modeless,,,"Rendering the scene twice has overhead, so it would take extra time even if it was the same number of pixels total. But that&#x27;s far from the only reason VR requires more power.<p>Due to the distortion caused by the lenses the scene must be rendered at about 1.4x the normal resolution. Then there&#x27;s a warping step that performs the inverse of the lens distortion, which is an additional cost. Also, good VR requires rendering at 90 Hz, not 60 Hz, so that&#x27;s another 1.5x. Furthermore, frame tearing artifacts and FPS hiccups are much worse in VR, so you need extra headroom to eliminate them even in worst-case scenarios.",1395269750

That expectation is not a driving force for an atheist or naturalist.<p>My point is that the absence of (expected) outward recognition or reward for altruistic behavior (by a supernatural or spiritual being) does not preclude someone from experiencing the joy that comes through service. And no, I personally don&#x27;t classify that joy as a selfish reward, but rather a natural consequence built in to the human brain. Whether put there by God or developed via natural forces/evolution as a mechanism to protect life (we feel satisfaction in helping other animals - not just our own species), it doesn&#x27;t matter; the fact is, it&#x27;s a part of our nature and can hardly be discredited in any moral debate.",1395269619

They&#x27;ve funded an extremely broad range of companies, but if you go back and check their past investments most of the areas listed in this RFS are underrepresented. Infrastructure, food and water, biotech, robotics...YC could be reaching much higher in terms of ambition than it has in the past. This will also mean more failures, but sama is smart and tough enough to hold on through it.<p>But realistically, how could YC get involved with early stage startups in most of these categories? Examples like SpaceX and Tesla don&#x27;t have minimum viable products. You can&#x27;t build part of an engine in three months and then show it off on demo day. Creating solutions for these problems at the most rudimentary level will require months if not years of effort and significant financial backing. It&#x27;s hard for two guys in a garage to build a prototype 10X battery or come up with innovative biotechnology. In order to get in on these ideas early enough for it to make sense, YC might have to start throwing caution to the wind and accept founders who have only drawings and computer models. It&#x27;s just so difficult for a small group of people to have a noticeable effect on problems on this scale.<p>The best way to get involved with the next world changing idea might be to choose capable and intelligent people and say &quot;I&#x27;m willing to bet on anything that you do, even if you&#x27;re not sure what it is or if it changes completely tomorrow&quot;. I think YC already has a process for accepting single founders without concrete ideas and they could expand on that. Or start making changes to attract founders whose companies are farther along in their development. No matter what they do, setting big goals usually doesn&#x27;t hurt.

The first step is to get noticed, and the second step is to close the deal (get hired).<p>You get noticed by appealing to what your prospective employer is looking for.  In this context, everything on your resume either helps get you noticed, or it&#x27;s a nice-to-have, or it&#x27;s a negative.<p>Extraneous technical experience and a great college background are pretty much always nice-to-haves.  Recent, relevant experience and accomplishments are generally the real things that get you noticed.<p>Once you&#x27;re in the door, you close the deal by demonstrating that you can kick butt on whatever your prospective employer needs to get done, and fit in well with the team while doing so.  It&#x27;s true that different people want different things, but if you can show you&#x27;re an expert at what your employer needs, and if you are pleasant to be around and work with, your odds of getting an offer go up tremendously.<p>The OP is right that if you fall off the job ladder, it&#x27;s much harder.  Your first priority should be to get some kind of job doing what you want to do, at the best salary you can negotiate.  But, you&#x27;re negotiating from a position of weakness, and that probably means you won&#x27;t initially make as much money as you want.  I don&#x27;t have a magic bullet here.  You have to get back on the horse, put in your time, build your resume, and from there you have much better prospects in future job negotiations.<p>Note that all these things are true regardless of your age.  No doubt, age is a factor sometimes (just like, say, ethnicity is a factor sometimes).  But if you sell yourself right, and if you can really do the work in an awesome way, ultimately that will carry the day, regardless of age.",1395267251

And the 17th mashed up iteration of Groupon for local pet food delivery is doomed as well.  But there are lessons in the failure:<p>--The mechanics may set the stage for a follow on game that returns the mathematical/pattern-matching element of 2048 back into the mix<p>--It highlights the difference between the mass market FlappyBird and the more niche appeal of 2048, both demographically and intellectually.<p>--It expands the mind to consider mashups of other games or game mechanics that might be interesting.<p>But more than this: memes of any kind are pure, intellectual riffing. It&#x27;s completely refreshing to see these riffs occur in the medium of code rather than Photoshop.<p>I&#x27;m not saying there&#x27;s a coders&#x27; equivalent of Cheezburger Network out there, but there&#x27;s an opportunity far beyond what you&#x27;re seeing if meme culture and coding intersect.",1395266876

I really like watching shows on BBC, I have to wait for them to show up here. This is the way of life, and price discrimination (because it makes business sense).<p>> Do you see the problem here? If HBO were to shut up and take my money, I&#x27;d gladly pay ten bucks per episode to stream it. But that would be soooooo 21st century, wouldn&#x27;t it?<p>Unfortunately HBO doesn&#x27;t want your $7/month on Netflix to watch an entire season of Game of Thrones, then cancel.

This is when it's key to lean on people you are able to trust, communicate with and most importantly, forgive, if the situation doesn't work out.",1189832326

So even big bad conservative ones will take a risk occasionally, take a chance on a new player.",1189831564

We pursued your ""option 2"" initially and ended up doing just the screencast for our homepage demo on jumpbox.com. <p>I work on a Mac and used iShowU for the capture and edited and produced it in iMovie. Our homepage video is just a quicktime file.  For the screencast in the tutorial above I  used the Adobe Flash FLV converter to turn it into an flv and wrote a small custom media playback swf to do what you see here-> <a href=""http://video.jumpbox.com/?app=trac"" rel=""nofollow"">http://video.jumpbox.com/?app=trac</a><p>good luck

That tells you something. <p>I agree though, its use today is something akin to the word 'synergy' or 'web 2.0' - i.e. repeated misuse in inappropriate contexts makes the term dilute to the point where it basically means both everything and nothing at the same time.",1189830298

epidemiological studies are based on complex systems, systems with many variables and non-linearities.  Atoms are a lot simpler (ha!)  Here's what I think is going on: a hot paper comes out, presenting an interesting theory.  People either like or don't like the theory based on preconceived notions, look at their data, plot every permutation of Xi versus Xj and publish the ""juiciest plot.""<p>Ok, it sounds like I'm saying that the ""scientific method"" has broken down.  I'm not, the preconceived notion is subtle, difficult, and hard to eradicate!  So, people aren't starting with simple and building up.  Not because they don't want to, but because they can't.<p>",1189828955

""Get rich in just 10 hours a week"" sure sounds seductive, but, for example, just how important was Rails in making them profitable?  Without Rails, would they be able to work 4 day work weeks?  In most companies I've ever worked for, the competition has been way too fierce to do stuff like that.",1216108158

Pretty crappy situation, as some were in tight situation  (one had just became a father, and another one almost at the end of the green card process) etc.<p>I think they got about 2 months of severance package, + some weeks of pay for every year they worked there.  Not bad.<p>Larger companies are really not as safe as people think.  In a case of recession, you want to be in a small-medium/lean company, and whatever you doing is their life-hood, aka core businness.  Some software companies just can't afford to fire engineers, as their businness will suffer.<p>Large companies like Sun, accumulate enough fat, that as soon as some bad times come, it is the best time to trim some of it.",1216107405

Bulldozer is a pretty competitive desktop processor. Bulldozer is powerful.<p>But not energy efficient. There can be no Bulldozer laptop.<p>And the world switched to laptops. Right now the split is 18% tablets, 60% notebooks/netbooks, 22% desktops.[1] And desktops are losing ground rapidly.<p>AMD simply has nothing to compete with Intel in the laptop space.<p>For the same price, Intel scores something nearly double on the benchmarks (1700 for a4-3400m vs 2900 i3-2350m). For everyday computing in the real world, that performance difference is:<p><pre><code>  AMD: ""This is so slow I want to tear my hair out.""\n  Intel: ""The CPU is no longer a bottleneck.\n  I need a new SSD for CPU speed to even matter.""\n</code></pre>\nAnd the Intel chip does all that using SO MUCH LESS power than the AMD (a4-3420m=35TDP and i3-2350m=15TDP).<p>And as you move up away from the budget laptops on the price/performance curve, things rapidly get worse for AMD.<p>AMD's failure was strategic, not technical. Even if Bulldozer had been 50% faster, AMD would still be on the verge of irrelevance.<p>[1]<a href=""http://www.inquisitr.com/76157/tablets-to-overtake-desktop-sales-by-2015-laptops-will-still-reign/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.inquisitr.com/76157/tablets-to-overtake-desktop-s...</a>",1347919075

You're a smart guy, I'm sure you don't think that.<p>But, for what it's worth, I do think Chrome's update process could be even better. I have a copy of Joe Zobkiw's ""A Fragment of Your Imagination"" gathering dust on one of my bookshelves; it was a primer on building applications with plugin-style ('code fragment') architectures for MC68k and PPC. It was written in 1995, and with just a little bit of tweaking, it would have been possible to use the text in the book to build applications which could do hot upgrades.<p>So this was a solved problem, in 1995 at the very least. And that's ignoring the microkernel example that Linux has blessed us with for so many years.<p>That 17 years have passed and companies with Google's resources still can't build their applications that way makes me really grumpy.<p>> <i>I have seen a Windows 2003 small business server running on hardware from 7 years ago and it never took more than 10 minutes for it to apply updates even 3 or 4 months late.</i><p>Never mistake your experiences for everyone else's experiences!<p>OK, story time. Quick background: a good corporate client of ours got a new administrative manager, he accepted bids for a big-deal network & server upgrade instead of sticking with the relationship we had with the client, they ended up going with another outfit which sold them a wickedly overpriced server running SBS 2008, Active Directory, Exchange, the works. Some of the knobs were turned the wrong direction and even after sinking a lot of money into it the server couldn't do what the client wanted it to do in the first place. So we inherited a mess not of our design.<p>We eventually get everything back to a stable state, and decide a while later that we should probably get the server caught up on updates. Now, the one nice thing about SBS 2008 updates is that the server will continue its AD and sharing services while it's preparing for shutdown and installing updates. The bad thing about it is that it doesn't give any time estimate and there's no sane way to cancel the update process once it's started. So, we make arrangements with the client -- they don't have failover for this -- and start the update process on a Friday afternoon.<p><i>8 hours later</i> the update process finishes. I had a really unhappy tech at that point. It's a secure facility, we're not supposed to have any external or remote access, somebody needed to babysit the stupid thing on-site the entire time. Plus, we bill by the hour, so client's not super happy either. But, industry says we can't not install updates, right?<p>So, a week later, we schedule the next round of updates. And it looks like it's going to do the same stupid thing again. Again, no ETA, no way to do just some of them and the rest later. No, it's just, ""Now installing update 5 (of 70)..."". For hours. I don't want to ruin my tech's Friday night for the second week in a row, so I tell him to go home and I make arrangements to be there first thing Monday morning to make sure everything's copacetic.<p>On Monday morning, it wasn't. The update process had stuck somehow, somewhere around 59 of 70 or something like that. The server had never rebooted, we couldn't tell if it was truly stalled or if the update process was still continuing but just really really slow. Despite the huge warnings to the contrary, we had little choice but to hard reboot the stupid thing and do damage control afterward. Everything turned out OK, but there's nothing that'll move your breakfast through your bowels quite like rebooting a big client's ""everything under one roof"" server in the middle of an update.<p>So.<p>Go ahead and tell me how Chrome's update process is <i>just like that</i>. :-)",1347918718

The objective in this problem is, roughly speaking, to maximize the rate at which you become certain about whether or not you've correctly identified the best bandit arm (or, more generally, the top <i>n</i> arms). This solves some of the more common complaints about classic MAB algorithms in that, when run for a finite number of trials, the resulting sampling of the arms produces a far more confident decision than either the regret-minimizing policies followed by standard MAB algorithms or the uniform allocation policies typically used in A/B testing.<p>The original article mentions problems in MAB algorithms dealing with delayed feedback. Such issues are largely ameliorated by the use of algorithms related to ""Thompson sampling"" [3], which induces stochastic trial allocation policies rather than the deterministic policies induced by UCB's selection process. It's definitely possible to develop Thompson-like methods for the exploration-oriented MAB problem, and such methods can rapidly distinguish the best among a rather large set of options, as might be required in applications like MVT (see note below).<p>Note: I'm currently doing academic research in this area and, if anyone's particularly interested, I could share some of the (simulated) empirical data and algorithmic details pertinent to what I said above.<p>[1]: Multi-Bandit Best Arm Identification, Gabillon et. al, NIPS 2011<p>[2]: PAC Subset Selection in Multi-Armed Bandits, Kalyanakrishnan and Stone, ICML 2012<p>[3]: An Empirical Evaluation of Thompson Sampling, Chappelle and Li, NIPS 2011",1347918168

Android supports these via the ""support"" library back to 1.6, but the APIs you're using are slightly different (eg. getFragmentManager() vs getSupportFragmentManager()) and the classes you use live in different packages (eg. android.app.Fragment vs android.support.v4.app.Fragment).  If the support library were more tightly integrated with the mainline SDK, you wouldn't have to worry about all these splits, but it isn't so you do.  You have to decide up front if you want to code to the mainline SDK classes or the support versions and then this gets worse when you implement other classes which use Fragments in a library meant for other developers -- should your classes assume those developer's Fragments derive from android.support.v4.app.Fragment or android.app.Fragment?  It gets really messy really fast.<p>Example 2: ActionBar<p>Not even supported via the regular support library, you have to go get ActionBarSherlock which itself extends the Android support library.  Kudos to Jake Wharton on this great library, but why didn't Google just make their ActionBar backward compatible to earlier versions out of the gate? It is clearly possible to do this as ABS does it.<p>I'm sure there is some specific reason the Android devs could give for why the support lib and the main SDK are so increasingly fragmented and it may have a very good legacy reason for existing, but having them work this way is harmful in the long run, IMO. Maintaining this split makes things much harder for devs just trying to get into Android who are very confused by all the different decisions they have to make just to get basic app functionality working across a decent cross-section of Android devices.<p>Granted, I'm not saying any of this makes Android development impossible or akin to rocket science, but it does make it needlessly complex which is bad given that Android is already seen as a bit of a red-headed-stepchild to iOS development even despite the overall marketshare advantage Android has.",1347917792

I would just like to state that Simpson's paradox is exactly why we shouldn't compare percent conversions. They are meaningless. However, many of the statistical tests like Student's t-test compensate for this paradox by including the number of samples in the tests. See : <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Student%27s_t-test#Unequal_sample_sizes.2C_unequal_variance"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Student%27s_t-test#Unequal_samp...</a><p>I think you said one thing that are at the heart of the issue. We assume that the E[conversion of B] > E[conversion of A] for the entire period sampled.<p>I think all of the details about Poisson processes are not required if you just assume that each person is drawn IID from the population.<p>I just don't think you are answering the right questions here.<p>Let's assume that each person arrives IID from the infinite population. Then, we have a Bernoulli process for each A or B query. A ""conversion"" results in a 1, a failure results in a 0. Since, these people are arriving IID, we can select a sub-sample which is also IID. We would now like to estimate the parameters for each process and/or compare the two processes. We can do this using t-test. This will give us the statistical significance that the one group had a higher ""conversion rate"" than the other group. Note: rate does not factor into this problem at all because we assume the participants were IID, so the t-test (used correctly accounting for different number of samples) will tell us which test is larger.<p>My question is now what happens when the parameters of your queries for A or B change over time. Still under the assumption that E[B] > E[A], it now matters greatly in which order you use your samples.<p>I think the only reason you brought the Poisson model into the discussion is to weight the more recent samples higher and down weight the earlier samples in your basket of samples. This is a heuristic for considering a fixed interval in which the samples are stationary. It effectively considers a window that slides with the time of arrival.",1347917500

Late in the release cycle, a pretty grody bug comes up, causing the application to hang. Or maybe the installer just plain breaks at some stage. However, the dev team has found a ""workaround"" for the issue. Run the installer twice, and it works. Back out of the hung screen and try again, because the bug only repros 1/10.<p>The bug gets punted because it's on a non-critical path, there's no data lost, it doesn't crash the entire application, and there's a workaround, even though the workaround sucks. Next time around, the bug is weighed against new feature work, and judged based on how it aligns with the product's core pillars. Not important enough this cycle, maybe next cycle.<p>Next cycle comes around, and the team no longer knows how to fix the bug, because it's no longer fresh in anyone's mind, or the person who wrote it doesn't work there anymore. The broken module is now essentially a black box, and the cost of fixing the bug has increased drastically. The bug gets punted again until the next release, because hey, we've got a workaround.<p>The project will be cancelled before the bug is fixed.<p>Not all big companies work this way, but enough of them do, or have subgroups within them that do, that it creates usability problems like the ones in the article.

Each product is still representing your brand and a potential option for buyers. You want to encourage someone to be excited about moving to your new product or platform without presenting the case that the old one is inferior or somehow deficient.<p>Consider if they iPhone was released with a strong focus on the improvements and bugfixes on the existing features without many new additions. Personally this is amazing, I'd be excited about that, but for many (average joe consumer) people I'd estimate it raises some key questions - why was there so much wrong? What will be wrong with the new one? Why do these products have so many issues?<p>Consider if iPhone was listing fixes and corrections and phone x was advertising all of their new features and updates with no mention of any rectification - personally, I'd be tempted just to pursue the one that was ""best"". Especially in a flooded market where it's hard to make a legitimate  choice, it's much easier if one thing looks broken and one thing looks wonderful.<p>Most companies are really just going through the process of iterative refinement but I think you need the feature icing to sell them to people, or really: to take the focus off of the fact the product needed rework, and on to the fact there's super super shiny new things! You quickly forget to engage your critical thinking when being dazzled with this kind of thing.<p>To be hyperbolic with the example - consider cars. When a manufacturer releases a new model and advertises the safety and performance enhancements, it may be likely that they were addressing issues with the previous model, but presenting them as new functionality. This is much more appropriate for a brand than saying ""we've addressed the issue with our brake and suspension package that was contributing to people losing control of the car"" or ""we've redesigned the porting of the heads on the engine so it's not running as inefficiency"". If you have the choice between the perceived perfection of one brand versus the other admitting a few people wound up wrapped around trees and they needed to iterate their design (even if both companies are following exactly the same process), it becomes a pretty easy choice, right or wrong.",1347915927

They were resisting putting 64 bits into the Pentium because it would cut into their already weak Itanium story. As long as they stayed there, AMD gained ground.

He's simply asking his fellow students to respect each other and the classroom, which is perfectly reasonable.<p>Furthermore, I know that shitting on universities is en vogue, but give me a break. Perhaps you are the one who ""did it wrong"" and were bored because you chose the wrong university, or the wrong field of study? Or, just maybe, different people learn in different ways?",1347915856

Apple is selling more than just ""hardware"", they're not just selling a piece of metal and silicon. That's what the author is saying is dead. Doing what Apple does, selling hardware + software + brand, is what's still alive.<p>So you and the author are not disagreeing. What he is saying is not that no one will ever build a tablet again. He's saying making money off the hardware alone is a bad idea. And that you need to sell more than that to make a good profit.<p>I used to work with jewelry, you could make the same argument that selling rocks is dead. But if you put the right branding, and tell the costumer a compelling story. We could literally sell a product for a 10x~20x profit margin. And yet, selling rocks is dead. Selling jewelry isn't.",1347915821

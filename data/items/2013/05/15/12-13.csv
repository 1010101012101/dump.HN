I've raised the finance, developed the marketing plan, established contacts with almost a thousand prospective client organisations, defined the product requirements in consultation with the industry, and written the prototype software myself. That's taken years of work and is not something to sneeze at! But ultimately, I'm <i>not</i> a skilled developer, and my cobbled-together prototype is not something that can be taken to market. So a lot of programming will be required to turn this into commercial-quality software.<p>The reason that I won't hire contractors to do that is that this is a highly specialised application -- not something that fits the mould of a typical web application -- and the developers will be instrumental in developing the core IP. It will take a few months for even the most skilled and experienced developer to get up to get fully up to speed with the internals details of this truly unique platform, and there will need to be many iterations of the platform as the product evolves. While it may be possible to do some of the peripheral work with freelancers (eg., the UI stuff, which will use fairly standard kit wherever possible), the unique core of the platform will only be maintainable if there is a stable team of developers to maintain it.<p>Imagine if Google had tried to design and implement Pagerank, the Google File System, and its custom server architecture using catch-as-catch-can freelancers. That would have been a catastrophe; you just can't develop truly unique systems that way. I'm in roughly the same boat.<p>However, if anything about what I've said has given the impression that I want people to ""run every aspect of my business"", then I am obviously not conveying my message clearly.

He also made this case on this on his blog when responding to Andrew Hacker's ridiculous suggestion to change math so that you don't actually learn math:<p>""The problem is that if you try to meet this challenge by teaching the specific skills that people need, you had better be confident that you're going to cover all those skills. Because if you teach students the significance of the Consumer Price Index they are not going to know how to teach themselves the significance of projected inflation rates on their investment in CDs. Their practical knowledge will be specific to what you teach them, and won't transfer.<p>The best bet for knowledge that can apply to new situations is an abstract understanding--seeing that  apparently different problems have a similar underlying structure. And the best bet for students to gain this abstract understanding is to teach it explicitly. (For a discussion of this point as it applies to math education in particular, see Anderson, Reder, & Simon, 1996).<p>But the explicit teaching of abstractions is not enough. You also need practice in putting the abstractions into concrete situations.""<p>Neither of us, though, can make the point as well as he does. In the book he explains what transfer is, as well as surface knowledge, deep knowledge, etc, and how an understanding of these concepts ca inform a philosophy of education and shape education practices.<p>Everyone, read his book! If the title worries you that it's too focused on educators, then ignore the title. The content is applicable to anyone interested in learning at all, especially if you want to improve the way you learn.

Straight sexual jokes are more likely to have a component of truth to them, which makes them must less pleasant to receive. Jokes between men are part of how men establish pecking orders, but sexual jokes are part of how men signal their attraction to women. Unwanted sexual advances feel unpleasantly intrusive. They're supposed to feel that way. It's a part of human sexuality - we're all strongly motivated to push for our own sexual autonomy.<p>Secondly, there's the fact that these jokes single her out. She's the only one getting sexual and sexist jokes, so that makes her a special target. If it were all those men making constant gay and sissy jokes to a gay man, you wouldn't think twice about calling it bullying. Hazing becomes bullying if one person gets singled out.<p>Bullying with a sexual component is straight up sexual harassment. Maybe it isn't meant that way, but that's exactly what it is. A lot of bullying exists because dumb people don't think about what they are doing. ""It's just a joke,"" they say. But it's not. It's the same joke, every day, from everyone. This is exactly the kind of situation where an employer has to step in and tell everyone to grow up and leave it at home. And when I say they have to, I mean it's the law, and they're going to get sued.<p>Also, the less direct sexism the writer faces show that she is not being treated like the men. The assumption that she is lost or trespassing because she is a lone woman on a building site is pretty sexist. Sure, women working on building sites are rare, but so are women getting lost on building sites. The whole asking if she was ""fit"" e-mail conversation was cringe inducing - and completely not how a man would be treated.",1368619515

5711402,comment,5704385,5710702,3,0,moron4hire,,,"No, didn't know Racket first, though I had a little experience with it, it really only translated to a general comfortablness with higher-order functions and the S-expression syntax (which I now find as transparent as curly-brace syntax).<p>I did try to go with Clojure at first, but found the entire ecosystem to be very haphazard. I already knew that Racket was easy to install and easy to use, so when I started running into trouble with getting Clojure to run on Windows and Linux (it seems it is super easy if you're on OS X, but eff that noise). Also, there was no one setup with Clojure. It was clear that Clojure without Leiningen was half a product, and I consider Leiningen to be a terrible piece of software.<p>As for learning resources for Clojure, that was another area where I felt like Racket won out. The Racket community is very, very friendly and extremely knowledgable, and the documentation at racket-lang.org is (mostly) extremely good. The sections on macros and continuations seems like they were written by someone with intimate mathematical knowledge of the issues, but not a lot of understanding of what beginners go through, but there are other sites (Scribble-based, even!) that do a better job of explaining the features.<p>And yeah, I didn't want to be tied to the JVM. Clojure ends up slightly slower than raw Java because of the need to emulate certain Lispy features, and years of Java AND C# development have given a very poor opinion of the JVM. Sure, there are more libraries available, but just how many do you need? There are some holes in Racket's library ecosystem, but it's been fun trying to fill them in and I think it's a site better scenario than having 15 different ORMs to choose from, and none of them are very good.<p>With Clojure, I had to install a JVM, then Clojure, then Leiningen, then plugins for Vim or Emacs or whatever, then a dozen and a half dependencies for the web framework, a lot of which are still in beta, have interface-breaking changes, and the documentation hasn't kept up. It was a nightmare of poorly executed distribution, something that drives me up a wall.<p>With Racket, you install Racket. It has other dependencies that it needs, but it handles it because it has a real installer. You can use Vim or Emacs if you want, but you don't have to right away. You import web-based dependencies in almost the exact same way you import standard libraries. In fact, you can even do it in the same require statement:<p><pre><code>  (require net/smtp ;; standard library for interfacing with a sendmail server\n         (planet mordae/couchdb:1:11) ;; a reference to a specific version of a CouchDB API from a specific user\n         (planet xtofs/firmata/firmata)) ;; a reference to whatever is the latest version of ""Firmata"", a library for Arduino programming.</code></pre>",1368619451

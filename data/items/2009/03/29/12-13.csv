It does not show that you can get stuff done quickly.""<p>By this logic, a masters or bachelors degree does not ""show that you can get stuff done quickly"" either, especially since most PhD students either have a masters degree already or they do the equivalent (of amsters degree) work before they start the work to ""solve a single problem in excruciating detail"".<p>If you are saying that the degree is unimportant <i>either way</i> and you make your decisions on hiring on the basis of other things(say open source contributions or industry work experience) that is self consistent.<p>Due Disclosure: I have no formal education of  in Computer Science and no masters  or PhD degrees of any kind. :-)",1238330500

537299,comment,537140,537253,0,0,ROFISH,,,"I think you're looking at the problem backwards. Some parents feel safe not giving their children shots because everybody else's children had their shots, therefore the total number of disease carriers are low.<p>The article states that some elementary schools are reaching a 'critical mass' of students without vaccinations that will cause outbreaks. Since most of these students tend from wealthy, affluent families, the example in the story of contracting measles from a different country, importing it here, and spreading it to the other elementary schools is a danger to all those who have not had their shots.<p>To answer the above question: If you're immunized, there's nothing to worry about. The problem is if you're not immunized, and your child is in a 'critical mass' set, parents may have to rethink their beliefs as the immunizations do protect against deadly diseases.",1238329417

In fact, I think you'd be hard-pressed to come up with a description that is more generally applicable to the autistic world of the software nerd.<p>You can candy-coat it any way you like, but what you're doing here is making a generalization about a group of people based on their choice to pursue an advanced degree.",1238328652

I've really enjoyed people who were smart enough to get a PhD, but found going into one deep topic for years in academia wasn't for them.</i><p>As one of 'em, I obviously agree, but what I found surprising is the number of 'normal' people who do too.<p>In academia, the very thought of leaving my PhD was unmentionable. I struggled for a long time coming to the final decision and was even referred to counselling to 'make sure' I was fully mentally stable (of course I wasn't! who is?).<p>Since leaving I've had <i>nothing</i> but thumbs-up from people about it, and that's been a real surprise. So +1 to dropping out!",1238328185

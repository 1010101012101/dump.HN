I’m talking hours of debugging that literally turn into seconds.""</i><p>I'd attribute this very much to the extra ""cache"" of the second brain that isn't having to manage typing and editing as snprbob86 above mentions.<p>Have you ever watched someone searching for some piece of info on Google or Wikipedia, or looking for a phone number on a website?  The person not wielding the mouse/keyboard can often parse and comprehend the info on the screen more quickly.<p>I also agree strongly with this:\n<i>""the QUALITY of the code that IS produced is so, so, so much higher""</i><p>I think the post helps to dispel some myths of pairing as well, and it works best if pairing to reach the goal of completing specific tasks.",1235270234

490305,comment,490216,490216,0,0,old-gregg,,,"A lot of folks seem to <i>like</i> the fact that Clojure runs on JVM. It solves the libraries problem and takes advantage of probably the best implementation of VM available. But unfortunately that guarantees that Clojure will never be truly mainstream.<p>Why? Lack of shared libraries. This is why Java itself failed. Look at the list of your processes: they all have significant number of code shared <i>between each other</i>. VM-based languages don't share anything [the only exception I'm aware of is ngen-ed assemblies in .NET]. If you rewrite all your running processes in Java you RAM consumption will go through the roof. Or perhaps even rewriting openssl in Java will double memory consumption of all processes that use it. Python/Ruby are little better because most of their standard libraries are implemented in C so at least two Ruby processes share the same implementation of printf.<p>In short, that's probably the biggest reason why VM-based languages can't come close to replacing various dialects of C on OSX/Linux/Windows: they don't play nice with the OS they're running on.<p>And needless to say, I would <i>LOVE</i> Clojure to become such replacement.<p>This brings me to a little dream: wouldn't be nice if Linux had a JVM-based userspace which would run all Java programs inside of just one big POSIX process, separated only by means of JVM without kernel involvement? Microsoft uses does something similar inside of IIS to host separated ""application domains"" for different web sites hosted by that IIS instance. If Linux did that, it would solve the following issues:<p>* Shared code!!! Loading a library once will guarantee that  generated bytecode will be shared by all in-memory programs that use it. I.e. starting a 2nd instance of any Java program will eat zero plus process-specific local data.<p>* Instant startup times (JVM is loaded and all images can be pre-cached avoiding code validation). Caching of validated bytecode in a dump image AKA CL images is already a feature of JVM AFAIK.<p>* Seamless interop between processes since they're all running under the same garbage collector and share the same type system.<p>* Vastly increased productivity for desktop software programming. Not having to use dialects of C is awesome.<p></dream><p>BTW I heard of Microsoft's ""Singularity"" project which looks something like this, but for .NET. I wonder where are they going with it...",1235269399

490303,comment,489896,490047,0,0,kubrick,,,"My point is that it doesn't have to be that way. The VCs are behaving in a predatory way, and they don't need to. I've worked at such a startup, and taking funding isn't just a nice option; usually it's a matter of survival. Of course a VC firm is going to take advantage of that fact. But if they showed a little more character by not sucking up such giant gobs of the companies, the founders would be encouraged to stick around and maximize the company's value. Instead, they're just encouraged to get what they can and then get out.",1235269091

Those firms in turn do the same thing, and everyone was happy because it created lower risk and made loans easier to get. In theory.<p>In practice this chain of risk management snapped when one company defaulted on their insurance of the risk and the whole thing came crashing down.",1235268541

""blub"" is the usual word.<p>(I could rant on and on about this, but I won't.  Basically, if you haven't programmed seriously in a dynamic language, a functional language, Smalltalk with Squeak, Lisp with Emacs/SLIME, and Java or C# with an IDE, any commentary you have on programming languages and tools is worthless.

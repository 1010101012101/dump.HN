6939842,comment,6939139,6939139,8,0,brandnewlow,,,"I run a retargeting company and this annoys me too!<p>The reason this stuff happens is because many players in the space soak up advertiser spend by not immediately opting users out of product retargeting campaigns after a purchase is made. The advertisers don&#x27;t always know to ask for this and the retargeting companies make more money if they don&#x27;t suggest it.<p>These personalized campaigns are so profitable for the advertisers that they don&#x27;t notice the extra spend being bled out on people who they shouldn&#x27;t be retargeting.<p>This tends to happen among the big &quot;enterprise&quot; retargeting companies that serve large online retailers like Macy&#x27;s. There&#x27;s so many people involved in the deals and operations of the campaigns that no one person is there to say, hey, let&#x27;s make sure this doesn&#x27;t happen.<p>The takeaway: Only work with retargeting vendors that give you control and visibility into who you&#x27;re targeting and why! We do this, but so do others. Not everyone is this lame.",1387511840

6939840,comment,6933360,6939367,1,0,unclebucknasty,,,"><i>Rather the question was specifically for the cases where &quot;there is a delay&quot;</i><p>It appears to be the case that Coinbase honors the price and, in fact, we know of at least one case wherein it goes beyond that. That is, they gave the buyer BTC at the new, lower price when the unreasonable delay would have otherwise meant a significant loss, had they enforced the higher price quoted at buy time. I believe that was posted somewhere on this thread.<p>><i>The risks on these transactions would only occur in case of BTC dropping.</i><p>But, that&#x27;s a non-statement, right? I mean, the <i>risk</i> is involved because no one knows whether the price will go up or down <i>at the time of the transaction</i>. To say there is only risk if the price drops implies the benefit of hindsight. Perhaps you meant to say there is only a <i>loss</i> incurred if the price drops. I&#x27;m not being pedantic. The difference is significant. The former implies that there is a scenario under which there is no risk. But, in fact, there is always risk. It just may be that all works out fine (i.e. the price does not drop before fulfillment).<p>><i>But &quot;any experience&quot;, how did you deduct that?</i><p>Perhaps I misunderstood your original question regarding the buying process at Coinbase. Initially I thought you were asking about the simple-case, which would imply that you had no experience as a buyer. You&#x27;ve clarified that you were inquiring about the unreasonable delay scenario, so I retract that.<p>><i>Right back at you</i><p>I&#x27;m sure we all have our moments. :)",1387511818

This is a really interesting point, I&#x27;ve thought about it a lot.<p>From the linked article:<p>&quot;In Startupland, everybody should be working towards the same goal: that big juicy exit. That’s the only payday any CEO should be worried about (even though more than half of them will never get it).&quot;<p>I can&#x27;t agree with that, and this is a key reason I spoke with others in the team and we decided that my salary as well as other c-level salaries should be quite high at this point. We&#x27;re not planning an exit anytime soon.<p>Until a day ago, my salary was $118,000. In the first year, my salary was zero and in the second year it ranged from $55,000 to $75,000.<p>We&#x27;re at a point with Buffer where there&#x27;s a massive opportunity, and I&#x27;m going into my 4th year now. At $2.3M ARR and being cashflow positive (revenues cover the salaries) we&#x27;re in growth mode and this isn&#x27;t investor money we&#x27;re using to fund these salary levels.<p>I completely agree that in the early years this would be a big red flag. I think the further you go, the more that notion reverses. I&#x27;ve heard that it can be a red flag if the CEO is not paid enough.<p>Would love to hear any other thoughts here, it definitely was a tough decision to make and I&#x27;m glad that by putting this out there we get all this valuable feedback.",1387509458

I&#x27;m glad you finally made the move down here.<p>What I found very interesting is that your decisions are driven not by where to move TO, but what you&#x27;re moving away FROM. Your trip to Oregon, then to Singapore and now NZ seems to follow the similar route. From a vastly different culture and super-densely-populated .sg to the extreme remote and lonesome place like .nz.<p>I feel that&#x27;s probably not the best way to go for it. Instead of trial-and-error, how about a search algorithm? Instead of &quot;Why am I here&quot;, why not ask &quot;Where do I WANT to be?&quot;.<p>Here was the list of criteria me and my wife came up when we were drifting around for a year to look for a city to settle down.<p><i>Crucial</i>: \n1) Small country with around 5M population. Coming from China, I feel lots of the problems of modern society & politics is there because of the large degree of separation. \n2) Walkabout city. We love walking. I want to make sure the walk from home to office takes no more than 30 minutes. \n3) Close to nature. Tramping is our main hobby. We want to start walking in the wild with less than 1 hour drive. (Reality is the closest one is 5 minutes walk from home but that&#x27;s a bonus.)\n4) With a high quality university. This gives us the continuous flow of different ideas even the city is small. \n5) Price is moderate. We want to have the leisure time to spend with our families and work on our hobbies. Affordable housing and reasonable prices give us the lifestyle we want without having to work our butts off.<p><i>Ok to give up</i>: \n1) Museums, galleries and fine restaurants. Even when we were living in Seattle or Boston, we spend more time on solitude activities like walking and reading. So cultural stuffs are great but we won&#x27;t die if we don&#x27;t have them. \n2) Varieties of products/shops. We don&#x27;t buy a lot of stuff and when we do, we buy ones that last very very long but not particularly in-the-fashion. So don&#x27;t have much choices is not a big problem for us. \n3) Weather. I love San Diego&#x27;s weather. Never too cold. Never too hot. But if it&#x27;s a city that rains a lot and doesn&#x27;t have a proper hot summary, we&#x27;re fine with that.<p>We visited and stayed in more than 40 cities during that year. Some we stayed 2 months, others a few days. When we started the trip, we have never heard of Dunedin. But those criteria helped us to quickly sift through the options and lead us to this unusual decision.<p>Three years later, we still feel grateful that we made that choice. Life is good here.<p>A warm welcome from Dunedin, New Zealand.",1387509291

You&#x27;ve lost your faith, but it would tear your family apart to leave.<p>- You have family who live in a country with a much, much lower standard of living. You support them financially, which is known in their community. Now their neighbours know _just how much_ you&#x27;re worth, exposing your family to the possibility of kidnapping or extortion.<p>- Your name is Google-unique, and identifies you as part of a group that is stigmatised on the internet.

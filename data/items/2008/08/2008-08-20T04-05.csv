Even if you are not a visionary at least being updated with the market is absolutely necessary.<p>Imagine how Keyes would respond on Amazon's release of Kindle, lest sold books online or having a vast catalog.",1219208019

(After 6 months of phone calls, and visits to their 'geniuses'. It ended with them giving me a brand new $2000 workstation in exchange for my $1300 brick.) But that was it.  If you are having problems with everything you by from them, you're doing it wrong.",1219207369

281199,comment,281111,281169,0,0,breck,,,"Thanks. Of course SlinkSet did all the heavy lifting.<p>2 is actually a very interesting idea. I know that among my friends some are interested in different types of startups(music, video, commerce, social networking, etc.). Finding people who want to start a company in the same space would probably be helpful.<p>I'm surprised by the response to JustHackIt. Already, in 1 hour the site's gotten over 400 unique visitors. Mostly from HN but also coming from Reddit now too.<p>I don't think JustHackIt will take off, but I do think that if a version of this idea was integrated into HN it could help a lot of people. I'm sure the rockstars here don't need this, but the average startup-rookie on this site could find it helpful.",1219206629

281193,comment,280817,280817,0,0,dmfdmf,,,"I once signed on as a contract engineer (mechanical, not software) for a Fortune 100 company. My contract was actually with a contract agency that this company normally uses. I had negotiated the details of the job with my manager and then met with the onsite manager of the contract agency to deal with the paperwork.  The lady got bent when I actually took about 45min to read every single line of the contract. She got even more huffy when I signed it but crossed out and initialed about 3 lines of the contract and handed it back. She claimed that I could not do that. I told her to talk to my manager and run it by legal (I knew they really needed my skill set) and get them to initial the crossouts and mail me a copy.  The lines that I crossed out legally claimed anything I might invent, create or produce at work or off-hours for the terms of my employment. So if I invented the proverbial better mouse trap on my own time this Fortune 100 company would have moved up a few notches and I would get my salary. Legal signed off on my edits and I went to work. So the moral of the story is don't be intimidated into signing something you don't understand and don't be afraid to seek changes to the contract if it is not acceptible.",1219206249

It would be hard to argue however, that lowering the drinking age to 18 wouldn't give them more and easier access to alcohol.<p>There are tons of laws that I disagree with in this country but this isn't one of them. In fact, I think penalties for selling to under age kids should be much more harsh than they are now.",1219206060

For those that don't know, xrange is a generator of integer sequences... a way of iterating a ""list"" of N integers while only allocating space for 1 integer.<p>*note: This isn't a ""python is better"" argument, it's an ""I'm surprised sbcl doesn't provide xrange type functionality, am I right in that assumption"" argument.",1219205181

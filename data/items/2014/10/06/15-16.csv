While it is currently less in the medical field, it continues due to the lack of services in rural areas.<p>In Europe many Romanian doctors leave Romania and make much better wages in England and other countries. In India and so many other countries, many left for the US. Being a doctor had social weight and financial weight that it no longer carries here, in the US.",1412611190

And as for it being the opposite of what fear inspires, I&#x27;m not sure I agree.

8416491,comment,8415645,8415645,1,0,saosebastiao,,,"This is a really cool toy example of one of my favorite algorithms. For an algorithm that predates the transistor, I&#x27;m constantly blown away at its modern use cases. For example, dynamic pricing, used everywhere from airline tickets to parking meters, is nothing more than a variant of the pid algorithm.<p>It is also used quite a bit in capacity allocation in a wide variety of industries. Instead of using NP Complete scheduling and discrete optimization that might not terminate, you take a page out of Hayek and use the PID algorithm to set a price on the capacity of each independent asset. Then, scheduling and allocation often becomes a matter of convex linear optimization.<p>In terms of practical use, I have zero doubt in my mind that the PID algorithm accounts for more economic impact than Page Rank or many other HN-popular algorithms. Just adding up the value of applications that I personally know about, it saves its users > $10B/year.  I would wager that the only algorithm that surpasses its economic impact would be Simplex.<p>It is also incredibly extensible. I&#x27;ve seen variants where the integral term is swapped out with fourier transforms, or the derivative term is swapped out with ARIMAs or Hierarchical Forecasting algorithms or Neural Networks.

Example from yesterday: I took my kids fishing on a party boat.  Lots of kids on the boat.  They congregated around the live bait tank.  I noticed one kid who was obviously sick.  He was coughing constantly all over the place.  I watched him cough directly into other kid&#x27;s faces. And, I am not talking about a gentle cough at all.  He coughed on nearly every surface he came into contact with.  If this kid was carrying active ebola or something else I would guess twenty to thirty people may have been exposed.  I made it a point to have my kids avoid him, yet, in that scenario, there is no way to control exposure.  For example, everyone shared one bathroom.  With over 50 people onboard, the &quot;about 2&quot; idea is just a suggestion and in two or three weeks it goes exponential.<p>Yes, I tried to find the irresponsible parent and even asked the captain to make an announcement.  He couldn&#x27;t care less, which further throws off the &quot;about two&quot; rule in the face of reality.",1412610645

You hit &quot;reply&quot;, and the message is composed to the mailing list.<p>A mailing list non-subscriber is not able to get a reply to a question posted to a mailing list. So the Reply-to trick is only compatible with subscriber-only mailing lists, which are a pain in the butt.<p>Reply-To is a wrongheaded solution to a mailing list problem: and that problem is people using &quot;reply&quot; instead of &quot;reply all&quot;, generating private discussions that do not go to the list, but unintentionally.<p>Today, a feature is showing up in mail clients (at least open source ones): &quot;reply to list&quot;. This addresses the problem in a better way. The mail client recognizes, from the headers, that the message being replied to is a mailing list item, and presents this clear way of replying. Furthermore, the mail client extracts the correct list address from the headers.<p>Unfortunately, &quot;reply to list&quot; implementations are still not kind to non-subscribers. The feature assumes the subscribe-only style of mailing list.

PulseAudio and systemd may have their own problems, but they&#x27;re in place for a reason. I don&#x27;t think they were selected due to some irrational hero worship for Poettering; they were selected because they were the most concise way to solve a real problem.<p>As much as one may dislike Pulse, it provides a unified, modern audio system that just works. I don&#x27;t know if you remember the bad old days when it was a fight to get applications to play audio correctly, but that has gone away with the introduction of Pulse. For all of its potential problems and inefficiencies, it provides the basics in a reasonably accessible and universal manner.<p>>And worst, it is not even optional, which is BAD.<p>It is optional. Open-source means you can run your own distro completely free of Poeterring&#x27;s touch. You may have to deal with the legacy left by his projects, but that&#x27;s nothing special; he had to deal with the legacy of ALSA et al and wrote compatibility layers that were major factors in the successful proliferation of PulseAudio.<p>>The package maintainers, the nerds that like to have meetings on what should happen with a certain distribution got convinced, or simply wanted to be the person to implement something new, without giving it some proper thought.<p>I&#x27;m sure the nerds that are entrusted with the security and sanity of millions of systems across the world would disagree about whether &quot;proper thought&quot; was involved.<p>I don&#x27;t really see a point in addressing the rest of your reply.

8416209,comment,8414859,8415936,1,0,sqrt17,,,"BSD init is certainly not the pinnacle of init systems. rc.d-based SysV init isn&#x27;t either. upstart also has its warts.<p>For some people, BSD init works just fine and they&#x27;re happy with it and they abhor the additional complexity. Without any doubt, Systemd also has its flaws - it&#x27;s not compatible with *BSDs, or generally non-Linux systems, it&#x27;s a departure from the &quot;everything is accessible using a simple text editor&quot; principle that has brought Linux where we&#x27;re now, and there&#x27;s a non-zero switching cost for each and every package.<p>Many people know polipo-audio (later renamed to pulseaudio) and the crashing propensity of its earlier versions, and who are kind of intimidated by the whole DBus/ConsoleKit tangle that introduces many moving components that are hard to debug when they fail. A system that is &quot;perfect in theory&quot; but crashes often is not that great.<p>So people are kind of apprehensive when the same guy who brought them crashing sound demons a couple years ago now comes over happily with a solution to replace the most central component for their system. Thus far, I&#x27;ve been pleasantly surprised by Systemd silently doing its thing and working as advertised. And I wouldn&#x27;t swap it out for upstart if someone gave me the choice.<p>The morale? Yes, people grow up, complex systems become more manageable with time when people write debugging aids for them. (Including things such as VirtualBox which make debugging central system components much easier - imagine living in a world where your systemd crashes and bugs simply get closed with a WORKSFORME tag and ignored).",1412607702

Bluetooth beacons can log and report information about devices that come within range of those beacons with active Bluetooth radios. Only interactive-time applications of a beacon need the cooperation of an app on a wide-area connected device.<p>Beacons that don&#x27;t have external power generally can&#x27;t use WiFi or mobile networks to do it, but this information can be uploaded on demand. For example, this information could be collected when coins from pay phones are collected.<p>Moreover, these beacons are reportedly installed in pay phone kiosks that do have wired connectivity. It&#x27;s possible, even likely, that they &quot;phone home.&quot;",1412607641

A slightly higher temperature (67 deg C) would ensure the white properly solidifies whilst still being cool enough to avoid cooking the yolk. 45 minutes is unnecessarily long a long as he egg remains under 70 degrees not much will be happening chemically once it&#x27;s warmed through.",1412607629

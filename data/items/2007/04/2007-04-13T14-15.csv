It's a very strange sensation and I wouldn't recommend doing it too often (maybe even check with a doctor first).  Generally, after about 5-10 minutes, I feel very similar to the way I feel when working out, except without the sweat, elevated heart rate, and muscle strain.<p>It's not exactly practical to swim 20 laps then sit down and do some design or development, even if you could bring your laptop to the pool.<p>But yeah, metacognition techniques are basically metaprogramming for your brain.",1176475327

So are you 100% sure that all your users have flash usability all the time?  So you have factored in the extra code to detect browsers with & without and covered the 4% or portions of the 96% that may have a buggy flash install?<p><i>'... Saying flash reminds you of the plugin wars is pretty off track, the war is over and a winner has been announced. ...'</i><p>in the sense that you still have to download, install & hope they work. Now there is another <i>layer</i> on top to get in the way albeit with less choice.  
Flash has it's place. But in moderation. It's just another form of vendor lock-in for developers and cannot always guarantee anything approaching usable results when it fails. <p><i>'... About 99% of the time, the presence of Flash on a website constitutes a usability disease ...'</i> [0]<p>It doesn't have to be that way when most of the time there are alternatives. Neilson recognised using flash as a problem in 2000  [1] and despite what he says in 2002 it's still the choice of developers, designers who want to limit their users interactions.

But I had the case last year where a bug in the Flash version for Fox scrubbed all the text in all Flash rendered screens leaving me to guess the manipulation process.",1176475296

It looks interesting, but the neighborhood I live in, Cole Valley (SF) is combined with Haight Ashbury into one big neighborhood.  These two are completely different cultures and valuations, so I am a bit disappointed in the lack of local knowledge.  We'll see if it evolves.",1176474456

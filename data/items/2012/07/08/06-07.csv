This doesn't mean that criticism of another culture is out of the question--- there is a lot of great cultural criticism that comes out of this.  Examples that come readily to mind include criticisms of our (in the US) trust that Obstetrics is better than Midwifery (statistically, midwifery has better outcomes on the whole, and this is optimized when midwives are the primary care providers for all lower-risk pregnancies and childbirths), criticism of how the Morroccan henna first-marriage ceremonies entrench patriarchy, and more.  But these are very detail-oriented criticisms which tend to address specific cultures, and look at them in ways which are very detail-oriented.<p>Even the anthropologists who have criticized things like female genital cutting in Sudan have tended to note carefully how it fits into culture, and tended to avoid the inflammatory activist rhetoric (and in many cases argued even more forcefully against being overly activist on the issue).<p>You will probably never see an anthropologist endorse a global campaign like this, because the sorts of thinking are very different.<p>So you are right, it doesn't preclude an opinion of the way a specific culture does things.  But it does seem to preclude arguments based on natural rights.<p>BTW, great book on this topic, which over and over addresses questions of criticism of other cultures and its place in anthropology:<p>""Deeply Into the Bone:  Re-Inventing Rites of Passage"" by Ronald Grimes.  To say it is inspired by van Gennep's classic anthropological work ""The Rites of Passage"" would be an understatement.<p>Edit:  To the downvoters:  One of the reasons why broad lines are usually avoided is that dynamics are rarely simple.  For example, in Africa, you have long-standing patterns of European meddling in local cultures, and consequently large-scale activism from the West against female genital cutting more or less frames that practice as one of nationalist resistance.",1341730528

But if you're working on a team, you'll have to read and understand other people's code all the time, and even if you're not, someone, somewhere, is going to eventually want to make that library do something different.<p>I agree that, of the two, good test coverage is more important than pretty formatting, but a good code style is going to make the code easier to debug when those tests fail and easier to extend when the library needs to do more. It's a simple matter adopt a coding style that works and stick with it, so there's really no good reason not to do it.<p>By comparison, it does seem like a trivial thing to obsess over. There are a number of coding styles which are all fine in their own right. I think people should worry less about the specifics and more about the overall intent-to write consistent, clean code. How many blank lines you have after block of code or where you put the opening bracket doesn't really mater in the end, as long as you follow the same structure across the whole code base.",1341730458

4213931,comment,4213162,4213597,5,0,redthrowaway,,,"More than ""improve the world"", it's ""improve the part of the world that matters to Google"".  They've done the same thing with advocating for a free and open Internet for over a decade--a better internet makes a better Google.<p>Let's look at what this might mean for Google, in practical terms.  Some 10-15% of people are LGBT.  It stands to reason that the same holds true of engineers.  Now, it's well-established that the well is running dry in SV; talent needs to be imported.<p>So if I'm a gay engineer thinking of moving to SV, how does this change my thoughts about where I want to work?  It stands to reason that a significant number of LGBT engineers would be motivated to work for Google by this announcement.<p>Let's look at non-gay immigrants.  Outside of places like China and India, most of the countries Google is looking to recruit from are way ahead of the US on gay rights.  So much so that the mere fact that gay marriage is an ""issue"" in the US serves to perpetuate the bible-thumping moron stereotype of Americans.  So even for non-LGBT engineers from Europe, Canada, Australia, etc, this would be viewed by the majority as a reason to work for Google.<p>Now, how would this hurt them?  The argument can be made that, among more conservative (read: Indian and Chinese) societies, where gay rights are not accepted as human rights, that some percentage of potential hires would be put off by such a move.  Perhaps, but I think that there are a number of mitigating factors, here.  First, gay rights aren't nearly as big a political issue in those countries as in the US.  It's frowned upon, but you don't have presidential nominees from one of the two parties proving how much they deserve the candidacy by falling over themselves to say who thinks gays are worse.<p>Secondly and generally speaking, ""culture"" is simply nowhere near as big an attraction for people from those countries as status and income.  So while it may deter <i>some</i> people, it likely wouldn't be many.<p>Now for advertisers: will anyone <i>really</i> drop Google for online advertising because of this?  Somehow I doubt it.  There may be some of the Walmarts and whatnot who drop them, but I find the prospect unlikely.<p>To sum it up: advantages for Google include easier, more effective recruitment.  Disadvantages include potential loss of customers.<p>I think Google wins this solely on the bottom line, let alone the fact that it's just a good thing to do.",1341730334
4213930,comment,4213162,4213802,9,0,edanm,,,"This is a very important concept which many miss, so it's a shame it's being downvoted.<p>Marriage is <i>not</i> a contract between two people, as many people think. Marriage is a contract between a two people, and society. The way you can tell is exactly because two people can live together all their lives, by their choice, without being married, but they don't get any of the societal benefits of marriage. All the marriage rights, fore example, but also social acceptance of their having children.<p>In fact, that's mostly the point of marriage. The contract benefits society by making more stable family units that will raise children, and be permitted to do so. The contract benefits the couple by giving them many legal rights and recognitions, including monetary advantages, that they couldn't get otherwise.<p>In fact, it's only in the last few years (relatively speaking) that marriage was even necessarily between two people who choose to be married to each other out of love, and it's <i>still</i> not that way in all cultures.",1341730281

The idea is that this would create an incentive not to commit fraud in the future.<p>Former bank regulator William K. Black says that the agency he worked for during the 1980s S&L crisis made over 10000 criminal referrals to the Justice Department, producing over 1000 felony convictions. That crisis was 1/70th the size of this one. How many criminal referrals have been made in this one?  Zero. How is that possible? The answer Black gives is: total gutting of the investigatory system.

4213871,comment,4213162,4213839,3,0,einhverfr,,,"One other point.  I am not convinced by biological explanations of homosexuality.  I don't think it's a choice anymore than some guy goes into a bar and sits down and decides what color of hair to prefer.  The development of sexual identity is a complex thing and there are societies in the past where homosexual relationships have been a <i>lot</i> more common than they are at present.<p>For example, Plutarch characterizes pederastic relationships (probably circumscribed by all sorts of taboos in order to render them non-predatory) as forming the political backbone of Spartan society--- these relationships provided young male Spartan citizens the ability, he suggests, to make the sorts of political connections they needed to be successful later in life.  If the surveys of Greek vase paintings are to be believed, it is likely that most Greek citizen women also engaged in some homosexual relationships within religious contexts in ancient Greece as well.  Was this bad?  I don't think so.  These were all channelled into very pro-social frameworks if we believe folks like Aristotle, Plutarch, and the modern scholars who have studied vase paintings and the like.<p>Instead I think the ""born that way"" thesis is actually homophobic.  Our society is very aggressively hetero-normal.  You can find Barby and Ken playsets, but if there was an equivalent Barby and Kendra dyke playset, well... it would be seen as sexualized in a way that Barby and Ken are not.  In this context, where our society says ""straight is the way normal people are"" in our toys, movies, bridal magazines, etc, the ""born that way"" thesis reduces to ""well, there is a small minority that is just different and will never be like everyone else.  You aren't one of them, are you?""<p>So in many ways perhaps even the gay rights movement entrenches obstacles to normalization of same sex relationships.  I am not saying this is good or bad.  I am just describing it how I think it is.",1341728931

Therefore, they reasoned that bringing people from, say, Africa to work in the plantations was a good thing.  It was bringing Christianity to some people who hadn't heard the message.  It was bringing these people into the domain of progress, and while the US never really had colonies elsewhere in the world in the same way the French or Dutch did, this was a major current of thought that justified a real evil, for the form of slavery these folks were brought into was uniquely oppressive even among systems of slavery.<p>Similarly we have seen human rights organizations argue that everything from gay marriage to sexual experimentation, to internet access is a basic human right.  This justifies destroying cultures which are different than us, just because we can't be bothered to tolerate the difference.  The loss of cultural diversity, and with it agricultural biodiversity, is just waved away as the price of progress, much like slavery of Africans in the US was.<p>I am not comfortable with this.

The only tragic thing is that he hasn't figured out yet that work != life.<p>I'm in a similar demographic as @Dave, live in palo alto, near his age.  Had some really good successes 10-15 years ago, and nothing since then.<p>My big activities for the past decade have been climbing, skiing and raising my kids.  Some of my friends kept working and now have vineyards and foundations.  And sometimes it stings that I don't fly private jets or have anything really impressive to brag about.<p>But I had years of board-meetings, soaking up the one-upmanship.  Once you become conscious of the non-stop compulsive attention seeking, there is a certain emptiness to it.  So I stepped away from that, and I wouldn't trade a vineyard for the experiences I've had.<p>Now I'm starting on a new company, working very hard with high confidence.  But if this company doesn't see a monster outcome, I won't feel like a loser. My prime motivation is the products, the people, and the competition, all of which I love.<p>IMHO we are in a golden age of software.  To me it feels like being in the major leagues where everyone who participates is lucky as can be.",1341727359

4213815,comment,4213162,4213588,5,0,ChuckMcM,,,"I've not worked there for a while, but while I was there they did support employees who were campaigning to help folks. Basically it would work by some employee wanting to help some group that they cared about and the company would generally help them do that. So to use your example a jewish employee who might be trying to do outreach in an antisemtic environment (or country) would get support in the form of time off or use of company resources to help their program or use of a conference room to hold meetings with an outreach group Etc.<p>However, there were pretty clear boundaries. I did not see any White Supremacists activities or holocaust denial outreach sorts of things either being supported or tolerated. My feeling was they try to support the employee caveat the fine line between supporting an employee who has a cause and supporting the cause itself. Recall that there were Google employees participating in the Arab Spring uprisings, and while Google didn't come out and say ""we support overthrowing corrupt regimes"" they also didn't immediately fire any employee who was working to that end.<p>Of course when the press reports anything its less nuanced than what actually goes on inside the Google Plex. Sometimes that is for the best, sometimes not.",1341727257

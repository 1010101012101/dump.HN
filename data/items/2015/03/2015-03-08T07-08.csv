9164954,comment,9163657,9163657,0,0,crdoconnor,,,">Most of the unhappiness about Secure Boot is not really about Secure Boot the mechanism – whether the people expressing that unhappiness think it is or not – but about specific implementations of Secure Boot in the real world.<p>Unfortunately, people in the real world use implementations of secure boot, not its specification.<p>>If you want to get cheap volume licenses of Windows from Microsoft to pre-install on your computers and have a nice “reassuring” ‘Microsoft Approved!’ sticker or whatever on the case, you have to comply with these requirements. That’s all the force they have.<p>Post-US vs. Microsoft, MS does not want to be seen to be explicitly violating anti-trust law, which is why in public and on the record, they will say and do nothing wrong. This has actually done a lot of good, because it does shackle their ability to engage in anti-competitive behavior.<p>It just doesn&#x27;t shackle it completely, and it means that in order to do it they have to be a bit more creative.<p>They still wield a large amount of power over the PC market, and manufacturers know this. They still have several ways of opaquely favoring or disfavoring some manufacturers over others. Manufacturers, on the whole, dont&#x27;t mind being opaquely favored and don&#x27;t want to be opaquely disfavored and know that crying foul about Microsoft abusing its market power in secret won&#x27;t do them any favors either.<p>It&#x27;s a cut throat market and nobody is going to feel sorry for you as a manufacturer if you died out because you didn&#x27;t get an Microsoft promotional tie in.<p>Thus sometimes, all it takes for anti-trust violations to continue and to go unpunished is a nudge and a wink or an off the record conversation between MS and manufacturers, and a decision made by either party that falls in a <i>gray area</i> of legal defensibility.<p>Here&#x27;s where it gets evil, and here&#x27;s the bit you are glossing over:<p>Secure boot PROVIDES that gray area while maintaining a veneer of respectability.<p>>If you have an x86 system that claims to be Windows certified but does not allow you to disable Secure Boot, it is in direct violation of the certification requirements, and you should certainly complain very loudly to someone. If a lot of these systems exist then we clearly have a problem and it might be time for that giant lawsuit, but so far I’m not aware of this being the case. All the x86-based, Windows-certified systems I’ve seen have had the ‘disable Secure Boot’ option in their firmwares.<p>Certainly you seem to be able to turn it off in most implementations I&#x27;ve seen, but I haven&#x27;t seen any that let me add trusted keys myself. Another gray area methinks.<p>Nor is turning it off particularly easy. I know where it is and what it does, but I know the history behind it.<p>MOST people draw a blank stare when they look at it and CERTAINLY don&#x27;t get to the menu and look at it and think &quot;oh, for sure this is the thing that stops me from installing linux&quot;.<p>Oh, and incidentally I&#x27;ve never eer seen a coherent error message caused by secure boot&#x27;s &quot;protection&quot;. Not &quot;you appear to be installing an untrusted OS&quot;. Just blank screens and opaque error messages.<p>Let&#x27;s say hypothetically that instead of being buried three menus deep, it was a physical switch, with a clear explanation about what it actually does.<p>Let&#x27;s say hypothetically that adding a key for secure boot were done using a clean and simple UI that my mother could follow. Flip the switch, plug in a USB key to boot from, menu asks if you want to trust this OS. You say yes and flip the switch back on.<p>Let&#x27;s say hypothetically that trying to install an &quot;untrusted&quot; OS gave you a clear error message.<p>If these were the case (and these things certainly adhere to the spec), I wouldn&#x27;t have a problem with it either. Let&#x27;s be realistic, though. It&#x27;s not that. It was not ever intended to be that. It was not supposed to be used to secure your system, and while Microsoft did just enough to avoid a lawsuit over it, their intentions are crystal clear.<p>Hardware manufacturers also know what&#x27;s up, and won&#x27;t be making it an easy to use feature any time soon.<p>MS is playing the same game they did pre-DOJ, they&#x27;re just trying to keep plausible deniability at the same time as greasing all of the right palms. MS pretends not to violate antitrust law. Microsoft contributes to all the right election campaigns. DOJ pretends not to notice that Microsoft&#x27;s secure boot <i>initiative</i> (if not the spec) is anti-competitive.<p>>As far as x86 devices go, though, right now, Microsoft’s certification requirements actually explicitly protect your right to determine what can boot on your system. This is good.<p>Microsoft is not explicitly breaking the law here. This is indeed good. Let&#x27;s award them a fucking medal. By the way, I didn&#x27;t deal drugs today. This is also good.<p>As for UEFI itself - it reminds me of XML - designed by committee, and yes, strictly speaking it <i>does</i> do the job, but it&#x27;s ridiculously overcomplicated and the market is littered with terrible implementations because of that complexity. Worst of all it was never truly necessary because a simpler specification (where&#x27;s the UEFI equivalent of JSON?!) would have sufficed for all use cases.<p>Another thing reminds me of XML too. There was a good market in being an expert in XML for a while. It was almost a club, in fact. The arcaneness plus the reliance the world had on it made for some excellent opportunities. Opportunities that, say, JSON never provided.<p>There appears to be a good market to being the go to guy for UEFI too.<p>Just sayin&#x27;",1425801212

9164951,comment,9164580,9164580,0,0,dsacco,,,"I don&#x27;t have a degree. I make an above market salary in NY for a software engineer. I have worked as a developer, and now I specialize in software security. I&#x27;m very happy with my career, and I haven&#x27;t considered going to school at all. I&#x27;m especially happy not having any debt (I don&#x27;t brag about this though, because I think it&#x27;s off putting and I still think most people should get a degree). I recognize that I&#x27;m an exception however, and I wouldn&#x27;t recommend someone follow my path unless they&#x27;re very good at exercising control over their time without supervision.<p>A few notes:<p>1. I&#x27;m good at what I do, and I constantly try to improve my skillset. I think that comes across to people, so no one has ever expressed any concern with my education whatsoever. In fact, anyone who I have spoken to about it has explicitly stated they don&#x27;t care (this goes for people at large recognizable BigCos to small Series As).<p>2. I network very well. I learned early on that having a mentor and knowing how to be charismatic and connect with influential people is better than spending time fixing up your rèsumè and then submitting it to a job ad. I&#x27;ve also found these people don&#x27;t care about the credentials.<p>3. I still recommend most people go to school. People have this tendency to see exceptions to the rule such as myself and think, &quot;Hey, look, you don&#x27;t need school!&quot;<p>No, you don&#x27;t, but how else with you learn? You need a plan. You need a passion. You need discipline. Those words are overused a lot, but to cultivate a skill like programming outside the classroom really does require passion. I sat down for hours a day when I was in high school, reverse engineering things I came across, reimplementing things, tinkering, reading from the same algorithms textbooks people use in top schools.<p>To be honest, the only real difference is that I read my textbooks from home and didn&#x27;t pay as much for them. That&#x27;s the sort of person you need to be. Again, not bragging, just a real point - evaluate if you are this sort of person with this sort of dedication before you drop the regimented structure of school.<p>4. I&#x27;m very open about my background and don&#x27;t hide it. It&#x27;s never been a problem and I specifically don&#x27;t hide it because I&#x27;m confident in my skillset. For what it&#x27;s worth, I still receive recruiting inquiries on LinkedIn several times a week.<p>5. You do not need to go to school to learn almost every discipline of what is typically called &quot;software engineering.&quot; You can learn almost all of computer science online. You have in your pocket the most self empowering tool since the invention of the printing press. You can, at a whim, learn every single algorithm. You can learn to implement every algorithm, and their corresponding time complexities, within six months (three months if you are really studious).<p>Think about what you can do with three hours of free time a day and the entire internet at your fingertips. I walked through learning several programming languages, algorithms and data structures, algorithm design, optimization, computer architecture, operating sytems, networking, etc. etc. by spending a few hours every single day. The difficulty is not the availability of the information, the difficulty forcing yourself to just sit down and do it.<p>My bottom line is that it&#x27;s still better to go to school. For example, I still recommend my young relatives go to university, because I think it&#x27;s very rare for people to really succeed in teaching themselves without structure imposed on them. But on the other hand I do feel very happy about my choices because I know my skills are strong, my knowledge isn&#x27;t lacking and I saved quite a bit of money. I don&#x27;t regret it at all. It&#x27;s never held me back, and it doesn&#x27;t have to hold anyone back, but you need the discipline and passion to make it work.",1425800828
9164949,comment,9159557,9160251,0,0,lsc,,,"But the all-day interviews have the same problem.  I interviewed at some startup in SF...<p>I mean, this was me looking for my &quot;job with low standards&quot;  so I was going through recruiters, right?   That&#x27;s how you get a job with low standards.  You put your resume on dice and include a phone number.  Answer the phone.  Wade through all the bullshit jobs that have nothing to do with your skill-set.   Find jobs you could reasonably do, and say yes to the interviews.<p>In my experience, this means that I&#x27;m competing, mostly, with people that don&#x27;t have other options... people that can&#x27;t get jobs through people they know, because they just aren&#x27;t that good.   For a lot of complex reasons, well, that&#x27;s exactly what I needed at the time.<p>I negotiate with the recruiter and $150K is within their range.  I mean, I&#x27;m... not 100%, right? lowered expectations.  So I should be looking for less.  But I&#x27;ve <i>never</i> had any problem asking for too much;   at worst, they laugh and offer me something lower, right?<p>Anyhow, so I show up at this place and they grill me for the usual 8 hours.   I mean, it&#x27;s not too unpleasant;  there&#x27;s beer and food and everything you expect, and they seem to be really into me.   The guy who is going to be my boss gives me his email and tells me to send him an email so he can get things started over the weekend.<p>The business guy is, well, he&#x27;s a business guy, but everyone else seems like people I could work with;  people I&#x27;d get along with, and the skill level was right in there;  even in my reduced capacity, I wouldn&#x27;t be holding the team back.<p>At the end of the interview, they ask what I&#x27;m looking for, money-wise.  Now, like I said, I negotiated this with the recruiter,  so I said $150K, but I noted I could probably be talked down some, and I mentioned a lower sum, one a friend who has worked for me for most of his career recently got.<p>The mood immediately changed.   We said our goodbyes, and I left.   I did email the boss, but total radio silence.<p>I never heard from these people again.  I eventually got the recruiter to tell me they didn&#x27;t want me, but...<p>Personally, I&#x27;d be less pissed I spent 20 minutes on a coding problem for them at home and then didn&#x27;t hear about it.",1425800748

So, one should not make a very far reaching conclusions from a government official lying - it doesn&#x27;t necessarily mean they were involved in some conspiracy, they may just been routinely lying to not reveal something that has no relation to the case in point, such as something that may paint somebody in unfavorable light, or some minor secret of totally unrelated nature.<p>Additionally, when criminal wrongdoing is suspected, the authorities routinely lie about what they know about the case, in hopes that the criminals would operate under wrong model of their knowledge and thus be at disadvantage, and also they would be able to distinguish somebody genuinely knowing something about the matter from somebody just watching the news.",1425799682

The <i>real</i> decompressor in this challenge is the Linux/C runtime environment. The &quot;decompression&quot; program you send is really just part of the compressed payload, and whatever steps you, as a human, take to produce the compressed payload (encompassing both the code and data portions) are ultimately governed by information theoretic limitations.<p>Another way to say this is that although you have the &#x27;privilege&#x27; of a designing a custom decompressor for this one file, this is not really a benefit since your custom decompressor counts against the space limit.

Providing the same guarantees but only for a single application doesn&#x27;t reduce the cost at all. If the customer is paying you to guarantee the delivery of packets, it doesn&#x27;t cost you anything more if the customer then decides they&#x27;re going to be YouTube packets rather than telemedicine packets.

You share your document, which is sent over plain text email.<p>2. The recipient can access it just with a link. There is no authentication or verification of any kind.<p>3. The recipient can forward the mail to data collectors so they can immediately get your name, your Aadhaar number and the document. There is no link expiry, which allows perpetual abuse of information by forwarding emails. This technology makes selling information a lot simpler and quicker.<p>4. Someone else&#x27;s email account gets hacked? Thousands or millions of names, Aadhaar numbers and documents could be out on torrents soon enough. Talk about government enabling things through technology.<p>Even if you trust the government to store all your documents, even though some may be issued by local authorities, this looks more and more like a comprehensive and centralized data collection mechanism. The next step, which may or may not be disclosed, would be to provide access to every government entity to query this database without any control or limits or oversight.

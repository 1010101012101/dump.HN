3484702,comment,3480494,3483116,1,0,jonnathanson,,,"I think you're misinterpreting me here. Windowed theatrical / home video release strategies are orthogonal to PIPA and SOPA (to which, for the record, I am staunchly opposed). Theater groups and studios would still employ a windowing strategy absent PIPA and SOPA, and vice versa.<p>And yes, you are entirely free to opt out of the windowing system by not buying the same movie twice. While I agree that the industry employs many deplorable tactics in an attempt to stave off technological change, there are plenty of things the consumer has freedom to decide for himself. Nobody's forcing you to pay for a movie in theaters and then pay again for it on DVD. Nobody's forcing you to buy a DVD, and then buy the ""Special Edition"" of the same movie 6 months later. Just as nobody's forcing you to buy Gilette's newest razor model, then buy the newer version a year from now. Or to buy the ten different ""pre-workout,"" ""post-workout,"" etc., versions of Gatorade currently on the market. Or to buy the ""Limited Edition"" Nike sneakers at inflated prices in December, only to find out that the edition becomes unlimited and goes on sale in January.<p>We can call these practices annoying, and they certainly are. But they're common to all consumer products industries, they're consumer-avoidable, and they're nowhere close to the same ballpark as PIPA and SOPA.",1326985154

Just a few nits...<p><i>The ""war"" ended in 1975, long after all the protesting has slowed to a crawl.</i><p>The war ""officially"" ended in 1975, but it really ended with de-escalation and the ending of the draft years earlier by our activism. Make no mistake about it, LBJ, one of the most powerful presidents ever, was brought to his knees, not by his political opponents, but by <i>us</i>. March 31, 1968 was the beginning of the end of that war.<p><i>Furthermore, people mainly protested not because the war was ""illegal and immoral"", but primarily because of the draft and how it affected them (or people they knew).</i><p>One of many counter-examples: the My Lai Massacre. Do you remember how aghast the American public was that things like this were happening on television almost every night ""for no apparent reason""? People have always really known right from wrong. The difference is when they decide to do something about it.<p><i>Now, how about the societal change regarding the treatment of blacks? Well, that was due to their organized protests and political action (from the action around Rosa Parks to the Alabama march)</i><p>I imagine there are quite a few who would disagree with that, from the urban infernos of the late 1960's even up to today.<p><i>It was when they were actually organized, agitated, and fought (often to death)...</i><p>I think we need to sacrifice more, but I don't suggest sacrificing our lives. Ironically, mine was a generation that did sacrifice the lives of our martyrs. To this day, I often wonder how different the world would be if the opponents of change hadn't murdered JFK, MLK, RFK, or Malcom X, or crushed the lives of countless others on college campuses (Kent State, 1970), Stonewall, or in the streets of Newark, Detroit, Watts, and a hundred other places.<p><i>...to gain their labour rights...</i><p>Kinda ironic that one of the worst cripplers of today's economy are the entitlements won by the overextension of organized labor (see auto industry or almost any local government).<p>I'd stay and debate more, but a client just called and I'm already 27% behind quota this week.

The decriminalisation of homosexuality was achieved largely by the work of Lord Wolfenden, Lord Pakenham and Arthur Gore (8th Earl of Arran). The same goes for most of the political changes we associate with modernity and progress - with the notable exception of Bevan and his peers, the people turning the wheels were mainly minor aristocrats in dusty tweed. A great many of the most significant changes were made contrary to public opinion, the most obvious being the abolition of the death penalty - a policy which most Britons still oppose.<p>The boomers credit themselves with having changed the world when they were young, broke and essentially powerless, but deny any credit to the generation that constituted the establishment at the time. Conversely, now that they control the majority of capital, make up the biggest electoral demographic and holds most of the elected offices, they deny responsibility.<p>The most destructive act of the baby boomers was creating a culture in which the individual is seen as having supremacy over the institution. The consequences are obvious and stark - a political system with single-digit approval ratings, where nobody feels represented and nobody feels responsible. A political culture defined not by fundamental ideological allegiance and difference, but by special pleading. There's no such thing as a socialist anymore, no such thing as a conservative or a trade unionist, just people with opinions.

I'm also sort of experienced in shooting digital.<p>I personally believe Kodak <i>screwed</i> film.<p>I mean, their new emulsions are superb, and they can run around Ilford and Fuji in circles in everything except maybe slides, where Kodak is still better but ridiculously expensive. They screwed film because they where the only ones in a position to take film into the next technological level, but kept managing that division as if it was 1980 and everybody was still printing at the lab or at their own darkroom. They should have focused more on people who still develop at the lab but scan film themselves.<p>The only feature they introduced that helped self-scanning was stronger carriers. They also claim dyes that ease color management in some of their color negative films but I call that bullshit. Color management in color negative film is a PITA unless you own a Kodak minilab. They had the opportunity to give everyone better color management technology by making targets that are affordable, making easy to use software or even making their own film scanner. They didn't, even thou there were strong rumors about it happening, and even while they still sell their stupid 4x6 print scanners.<p>Basically now scanning color negative films for most photographers is sort of a painfully inaccurate manual process. Slides are easier but also cost more and have less dynamic range than digital and similar color rendition and accuracy. Black and white can be managed by even amateur photographers but Kodak could still make it a whole lot easier.<p>I really would like for at least their film division to manage to go out of bankruptcy, since I have only recently began shooting Ektar and love Portra...

And the ending of the war mainly had to do with an exhaustion of resources amidst an economic and oil crisis, and, well, actually losing the damn thing. There <i>is</i> such a thing as a lost war.<p>Furthermore, people mainly protested not because the war was ""<i>illegal and immoral</i>"", but primarily because of the draft and how it affected them (or people they knew).

It ended itself in the conformism and consumerism of the seventies and in a drug and ""self-discovery"" haze.<p>If the world has indeed changed since the 60s, it's for the worst, in the political sense, concerning society, freedom, public and international policy (technology and science have of course improved, but those two always do, since the dawn of time, and exponentially since around 1600).<p>Now, how about the societal change regarding the treatment of blacks? Well, that was due to their organized protests and political action (from the action around Rosa Parks to the Alabama march).

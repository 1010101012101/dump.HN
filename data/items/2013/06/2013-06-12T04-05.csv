I found out, that like computers, it&#x27;s ultimately a tradeoff between desk space(RAM) and stack iteration (CPU) by me.<p>I haven&#x27;t tried radix sort - I&#x27;ll go try it today and see how well I do. Nope, I don&#x27;t do selection sort either, since it&#x27;s quicker to perform insertion sort when stack size gets manageable.",1371013184

5866594,comment,5866357,5866550,14,0,wisty,,,"Basic PR. Dump bad news (at a time when reporters are unlikely to pick it up), trickle out good news, and it gives you a more positive image. They are doing the opposite - trying to get maximum outrage over the stuff they leak.<p>That&#x27;s why companies often need PR consultants. Because they are tempted to try to keep stuff under wraps, even when it&#x27;s slowly trickling out. They need an adult to tell them &quot;people will find out anyway, so just dump the whole thing in a press release on a Friday, so you get it all out in one headline&quot;. Plus, reporters will be reporting <i>your</i> spin on it, and you look like you&#x27;ve made an honest mistake and are coming clean.<p>The NSA should probably figure out what&#x27;s getting leaked, then spoil the PR attack by coming clean. Somehow, I can&#x27;t see them doing it.",1371013155

The less money they have, the less stuff they can do. Return power (and tax revenues) back to the states so that the people of that state can have a more powerful influence in state/local politics instead of everyone pleading, fighting, and begging at the national level in Washington.<p>And since radical downsizing won&#x27;t happen voluntarily, as both political parties are corrupt and incompetent, the only way I can see this happening is for the government to continue borrowing and spending money into oblivion, which will ultimately trigger an economic default. At that point, there will be no money for new secret programs.",1371012916

And as I said, none of my friends can not use LUA to do something serious, but easy to work with javascript. Most of what I&#x27;ve done is independent of the language I use a different approach to scripting the database.<p>Now cron can do directly in the database. The results you can obtain using REST request (with gzip is very less traffic). On the javascript there is a huge amount of libraries, such as Crypto, if desired, there will be templates to insert.

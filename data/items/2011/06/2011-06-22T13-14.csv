Quake is a great game, but imagine running the same level or even worse, same portion of a level all day long looking for obscure bugs.

They were both asking ""how many of these things are there?"". Cardinals, not ordinals.<p>2. A mathematician who's so used to 0-based working that he always counts from 0 simply will not interpret ""0,1,...,11"" as meaning that there are 11 things. The same unusual way of looking at things that makes him start from 0 will also make him proceed from ""...,10,11"" to ""there are 12 things"".<p>3. The mathematician's wife didn't ""ask for 12"". She left him with 12 packages. What happens in the joke is not a miscommunication, it's s slip-up by the mathematician in going from ""...,10,11"" to ""12 things"". Which I suggest is highly implausible for a mathematician in whom 0-based counting is deeply ingrained.<p>And now I've had enough of overanalysing this joke and shall leave it alone. Feel free to have the last word if you wish.<p>Incidentally, (some) mathematicians prefer their ordinals to start from 0 as well. The trouble is that ""first"" (derived from ""foremost"") really ought to mean the one you start with rather than the one numbered 1, and ""second"" (from the Latin ""secundus"" meaning ""following"") really ought to mean the one after that, and ""third"" etc. are derived from the number names and therefore have to correspond to 3,4,... -- so there's a gap at 2. One of my acquaintances therefore likes to use a sequence of ordinals that goes: first (0th), second (1nd), <i>twifth</i> (2th), third (3rd), fourth (4th), fifth (5th), etc. I don't think it'll catch on.",1308750796

2683067,comment,2682712,2682933,10,0,troutwine,,,"Presumably he means Ordersky's Programming Scala. While it is possibly one of the better Scala books available it is downright bad, having committed the doorstop producing sin of confusing a language tutorial with a reference with a thesis defense. The second edition of the text is all over the place, providing little in the way of even trivial program examples and maintaining shockingly conservative advice from the first edition, written for the language in its state a few versions back.<p>The assessment that Scala is a pretty structure built of weak wood is not too far off, at this point. Compared to other strongly functional languages--Haskell and ML, say--the type system is shoddy and limited. In part this is a frustration of maintaining objects on Java's terms, but also defects in the JVM: type erasure is a hair-shirt that neither of languages I mentioned previously have to wear. You can somewhat avoid the loss of types with manifest hacks, but it's shoddy business. Often you can't; note that Akka has a distinctly dynamic feel, being that certain messaging functions--!! and !!!--must return an Option[Any] even when the original message is well-typed. The system loses the type information at runtime!<p>Compilation speed is also an agrivation. It's a slower process than Haskell--not zippy to begin with--and comes with less result, to boot. All that said, I tentatively like Scala, especially if a project is required to run on the JVM. I find it to be an especially pragmatic language, if unbeautiful and not something I intend to use for long-term,  exploration coding. A fine choice for a language to be used in anger, let's say, if the memory usage of the JVM is of no concern.",1308750648

I try to always assume that my thinking is flawed, so after I read your post, I tried to go back and read my own as if someone else wrote it. I know that sounds silly, but it often leads to insights I wouldn't otherwise have.<p>You make a good case for the complexity, which is one of the factors I consider. One of my unspoken concerns is that an open source library like Socket.io is going to get stale. I keep an eye on the commit log, and it looks like development is pretty active, but a look at the impact graph shows that there was a lull, and it looks like development might be changing hands. This is par for the course with open source projects, but I question whether ""par for the course"" is best for our project.<p>My other big concern is running ""yet another server"". We're currently running a very standard Rails stack on VPS infrastructure. We're not on a full-blown ""cloud"" provider, because I don't trust them. Heroku has had too much downtime for our company. AWS offers multiple AZ redundancy, but there's an inherent complexity there that we're not ready to tackle.<p>Unlike most startups, our revenue generating traffic isn't spread out over thousands of visits. Our revenue is made during a purchasing event that runs for a half hour. Some days, there might only be a single event. If our infrastructure is down for that event, we stand to lose $25k-$50k. I know we're not the only one with this problem (some would lose millions over the same time period), but we're a bootstrapped company. A major outage like the ones Heroku has experienced could put a serious hole in our cashflows.<p>Because of this, we run a very straight forward Rails hosting stack (Apache/Passenger/MySQL) on a straight forward Xen VPS host at data centers in Dallas and NYC. I fully expect that at some point in the future, one of these data centers is going to disappear off the net and we'll have to be ready. If our entire hosting provider disappeared, I could bring up every one of our customer app instances in a half-day. I know this because I've done the drills using local VPS builds from scratch, and we use third-party, off-net backup locations.<p>Any XaaS product we integrate in to our core product would have to demonstrate a similar focus to uptime and redundancy. The recent AWS outage that took several high-profile websites offline is a good example. Lot's of seemingly smart companies hadn't deployed across multiple AZs because of the complexity. I can't partner with a company that makes those kinds of decisions.<p>I know you don't want to try to sell me Pusher, but I'm genuinely curious about Pusher's commitment to uptime. I'd love to see a blog post, or knowledge base article that talks about Pusher's redundancy and disaster recovery plans. I'd love to ""just trust"" that XaaS companies have this sort of thing covered, but history has taught me otherwise.<p>Thanks again. I really appreciate the response.",1308750204

There are, however, motivations beyond those he takes into consideration.<p>Uploading:
Again, he doesn't make any arguments as to why uploading is not achievable, he just talks about the very hard ethical questions that arise when dealing with uploaded intelligences. That didn't stop us from inventing nuclear weapons and a host of other ethicaly challenging technologies, so why would it stop us from inventing uploading?<p>One particular statement he makes in this section I do want to address specifically:
""Uploading implicitly refutes the doctrine of the existence of an immortal soul, and therefore presents a raw rebuttal to those religious doctrines that believe in a life after death.""<p>This is so obviously untrue that I don't know how any intelligent person could use it in a serious argument. Religions that believe in immortal souls will simply maintain that the uploaded copy is just that: a copy, a soulless simulation of a real person. How can you possibly prove this one way or another? ""Soul"" is a purely religious concept, beyond any temporal means of observation or measurement, and therefore not subject to empirical study. I still think you would see plenty of religious people oppose uploading, but for different reasons.<p>He finishes by discussing the possibility that our entire universe is already a simulation being run in the ""real"" world, and admits that nobody can prove this one way or another, at least not anytime soon.",1308750073

Pattern recognizing feedback loops with memory that can reflect on our own existence.<p>I do not have the knowledge to determine the feasibility of the various methods but I do believe that the mind isn't a thing as such but rather a system that simulate a reality, the reality that we experience from our vantage point.<p>So to me the question is not as much whether we can transcend from one physical form to another but rather how we will connect with more and more external computation that again will mold our internal computation maybe even take over some parts.

Not only that, they seem to be using absolute GDP numbers which are meaningless, because a $1 goes a much longer way in U.P. than it does in NYC. At the very least they should have used PPP numbers. Some glaring problems:<p>1) As the content of the article points out, Uttar Pradesh is the most populous state in India. This is why comparing them to Qatar in the graphic, just on the basis of similar absolute GDP numbers, is very misleading. Qatar's population is under 1.5M. Uttar Pradesh's population is nearly 200M.<p>2) Comparing Gujarat to Angola is like comparing the Silicon Valley Bay area to an arbitrary African country based on similar GDPs. Gujarat has one of the best infrastructure setups in all of India and has been amongst the fastest growing states for the past decade.<p>3) Almost all of Maharashtra's $175B GDP comes from the city of Mumbai.

That ridiculous $300 price was probably the main reason Google TV failed last year.<p>I was also hoping for Tegra 3 in some of the TV's or set top boxes, and that Google would take advantage of this to try to turn Google TV at least a little bit into a gaming console platform.<p>Developers are already starting to port their PC or PS3 games to Android phones or tablets, and Honeycomb 3.1 is getting gamepad support. I think it would be a good idea to have some nice console like games in the Android Market for Google TV. But it needs Tegra 3 to really push this console idea, because the games would actually have console-like graphics.<p>EDIT: <i>Side note:</i> I know that Google doesn't make the devices themselves, but they have a very close relationship with the launch manufacturers. So how is it that Google fails again,  and again, to grasp what the right price would be for the product launch? It's happened 3 times already.<p>1) Google TV set top box was $300, instead of $150, or even $100.<p>2) Xoom started at $800, instead of having a wi-fi only version at $500 at most ($400-$450 would've been the sweet spot)<p>3) Chromebooks at $430, when it should've been $250-$300 at most. What happened to the ""disposable machine"" idea? I mean it's irrelevant if it had even a quad core i7 in it, and you'd think the price would be justified. But it wouldn't be. At the end of the day it's an ""Internet-only machine"". There's a price threshold you can't pass.<p>Google seems more inexperienced in the consumer market than I thought. Price is such a critical factor in gaining market acceptance, especially for a new product category. They should first ask themselves ""What is the right pricing for this type of product"" and <i>then</i> try to squeeze the most powerful specs they can in it.",1308747788

He asks us to make a large investment in learning a language that might pay off in the future...  might.<p>My understanding of Scala is quite imperfect but the more I've learned the more it seems that it's got pretty facades built over weak wood.  Rather than being a 'scalable language' it comes across like a fake town that was built as a set for a Western.  Look at any beautiful concise code sample that they try to seduce you with and you find that any small change requires tripling the code size.  Look at the chapter in the book on DSLs and the take-away is ""don't try to build internal DSLs"".<p>Be it looking at the profiler running on on a Scala program that uses actors or finding that I never quite seem to get away with not having to declare types explicitly,  I have a facepalm event every hour or so working with Scala.<p>In my case,  (2) has nothing to do with it.  I'm quite familiar with functional programming,  both in languages that support it well and languages that don't.  These days even my PHP looks like LISP.<p>(3) is certainly true,  and I think it has something to do with the cultural difference that @speckledjim points out.<p>Anyone who's got to work with Scala will definitely confront (4);  if you're working in Java or PHP or some other commercially viable language you can probably solve a high fraction of problems by using Google and Stack Overflow.<p>If you're programming in Scala you'll have a lot more success understanding the fundamentals of the language.  If,  for instance,  you need to access Scala objects from Java (particularly the super-prevalent ones like Option and List) you'll find that cookbook-style documentation is 100% AWOL.  Go look at the scaladocs for Option and List,  however,  and you'll be calling methods on them in no time from Java.<p>If you insist on working with Scala,  get a book and read it all the way through from the beginning,  skipping forward when you don't understand something.",1308747722

People who didn't use many or any plugs have less holding them to FF so will experience less friction from the change, and people who use specific plugins will stay on FF at least until Chrome has an equivalent extension.<p>Also you need to factor in differences in the standard feature sets of the two browsers. As a developer the first thing I add to a new FF install is Firebug, but a chunk of that functionality seems to be built-in to Chrome. Some behavioral differences may explain some of the difference too: if Chrome already defaults to the behavior someone used an add-in for in FF then they won't need an extension to tweak the UI.<p>Further to that people associate FF primarily with add-in flexibility and Chrome primarily with speed - so this perception divides the audience before they even have one of them installed and if you a particular <i>because</i> of its flexible plug-in support and wide range of them available then you are more likely to be the sort of person that has a few installed than someone who chose a particular browser specifically for speed.<p>FYI: I tend to use Firefox more than anything else, but use Chrome/Chromium for one or two script intensive apps and for its convenient ""incognito"" mode (both for when others want to login to their webmail/facebook/what-ever quickly on my netbook without leaving traces or logging me out of my account, and for <i>ahem</i> other things).",1308747683

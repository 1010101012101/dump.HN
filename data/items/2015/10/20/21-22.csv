How many competitors SpaceX will ever have?<p>So if Uber wins the market, they&#x27;ll have it for themselves.<p>Asset-heavy transportation businesses aren&#x27;t as risky as people assume. Airlines buy they airplanes. Shipping companies buy their (massive) ships. Hertz can afford the cars they rent. FedEx can afford their truck.<p>Those businesses rarely go out of business and the &quot;market fluctuation&quot; is not really a thing. If there&#x27;s a sudden 10% drop in flights, the airline will bump the prices by 10%, retire some routes and voila, they are profitable again.<p>I get that there&#x27;s capital and risk benefit to offloading car ownership, I don&#x27;t see how that translates to low margin.<p>Margin is whatever Uber decides it to be. If they can lower the cost of providing the service by 10x by not using humans, then they can offer a price that is only 5x lower and get obscene 50%+ margin.<p>What might affect a margin is lots of competition, but this seems like &quot;winner takes most&quot; business (currently Uber is 10x Lyft, it&#x27;s closest competition in US).<p>Finally, getting money to fund such business is easy. Uber already raised ~$10 billion.

See, papers on high-performance elliptic curve cryptography tend to give formulas for implementing calculations using the three-operand style I mentioned. One reason for having a DSL is to make it so that we can copy/paste, with minimal changes, those formulas into our programs so that we can easily see that we&#x27;re implementing the formula from the paper exactly. If you C++-ify or Rust-ify them, then you lose that obvious &quot;this is the same&quot; comparison ability. Also, for the kinds of code where such a DSL would be relevant, you really don&#x27;t want a C++ or Rust compiler&#x27;s optimizer to be involved at all. And, if you want to prove the correctness of your ECC code, you don&#x27;t really want to have to first (1) Define a formal semantics for C++ or Rust, (2) Prove that your C++ or Rust compiler is correct with respect to that formal semantics, and (3) Prove that your transliterations of the original formulas are equivalent  to the original formulas.<p>I&#x27;ve already written a prototype that compiles that DSL into C, which requires a leap of faith that the C compiler won&#x27;t ruin things for us. That prototype convinced me that it would likely be much less work to go the DSL route than the C++/Rust library route. Note that I prefer writing C++ and Rust libraries to creating DSLs, so this was a disappointing conclusion for me.",1445377571

OSM is frequently rejected for reasons having nothing to do with awareness or quality. The licensing makes it unusable for many analytics applications.<p>There is a de facto prohibition on the blending and derivation using many geo data sets due to licensing restrictions and regulatory requirements, including many government data sets. Even OSM does not have the equivalent of a BSD-like license. In many cases, blending two sets of geo data and doing derivative analytics creates an unresolvable conflict between the individual licensing terms and the requirements of a specific application. Specific to OSM, many popular geo data sets have regulatory restrictions that make them fundamentally incompatible with OSM for many applications where OSM would otherwise be a great data set.<p>With commercial data set providers, the license is customizable to be appropriate for the regulatory and other requirements of the application. With OSM, you are stuck with an OSM license, which would violate all kinds legal and practical constraints for many use cases. I can say that for many geo applications I&#x27;ve supported, compliance with the OSM licensing would literally be violating the law.

It really depends on the pattern - some are free, others (that we would otherwise support) are very expensive or impossible. Our SoM is fully general (i.e. it doesn&#x27;t time out or give up after N bytes or K stream writes) so the worst case means tracking lots of 64-bit offsets through our automata.<p>The backend is a big pile of code that coordinates the efforts of many different automata and subsystems, most of which are a combination of a C implementation plus a big table of some sort to implement NFA/DFA/literal matcher/whatever. This isn&#x27;t something of which we are particularly proud.

Media coverage is a bad indicator of reality. I would prefer these numbers stay lower [0]. But these numbers never get brought up by the media. They happen frequently enough that articles could be drummed out once a week, I wonder why they aren&#x27;t?<p><i>>I don&#x27;t think that people complaining about excessive use of force hurt the point of view that the US is a police state.</i><p>I&#x27;m arguing that the people who bring up foolish points as solutions are more harmful than helpful. I for one don&#x27;t like reading articles like this one [1]. This isn&#x27;t about being a police state - this is about people not knowing how to deescalate things. &quot;Taking arm/leg shots&quot; is not deescalation. Not shooting a violent and <i>armed</i> suspect is not deescalation. More or less asking officers to risk death is <i>not</i> deescalation. Yes - the US is increasingly becoming a police state. No, asking officers to risk death instead of shooting is not going to solve it.<p>I agree about being members of the community. Public outreach and police interacting with the community in <i>friendly</i> ways goes a long way. We need more of this [2] [3] [4] [5]. It builds trust, it builds a sense of community, and that&#x27;s something sorely lacking in many places of the US.<p>[0] <a href=""http://imgur.com/vu7kh0L.jpg"" rel=""nofollow"">http://imgur.com/vu7kh0L.jpg</a><p>[1] <a href=""http://www.cnn.com/2015/08/13/us/alabama-birmingham-police-detective-pistol-whipped/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.cnn.com/2015/08/13/us/alabama-birmingham-police-d...</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://imgur.com/gallery/fgGLfPv"" rel=""nofollow"">http://imgur.com/gallery/fgGLfPv</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://imgur.com/gallery/6tpEqly"" rel=""nofollow"">http://imgur.com/gallery/6tpEqly</a><p>[4] <a href=""http://imgur.com/gallery/ONn2PQm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://imgur.com/gallery/ONn2PQm</a><p>[5] <a href=""http://imgur.com/gallery/C6d9d6Y"" rel=""nofollow"">http://imgur.com/gallery/C6d9d6Y</a>",1445375755

These casts are very practical, as you might know more than the analyzer. Flow takes a stricter position here, which is a theme.<p>* Function are bivariant w.r.t. their parameters (which is unsound) in TypeScript, but contravariant in Flow. Again, this is an intentional, practical choice, but Flow emphasizes soundness.<p>* TypeScript asks users to add annotations in scenarios where Flow will infer types. TypeScript will infer any (there is a &quot;no implicit any&quot; option).<p>* Classes in Flow are nominal (interfaces are structural). Classes are structural in TypeScript.<p>* Flow adds no additional runtime syntax to JavaScript; TypeScript does (enums, for example). Flow does support some ES2016 features (async/await, object spread), but generally holds off on experimental features (stage < 2).<p>* Flow has a couple interesting features absent in TypeScript, like disjoint unions. I suspect/hope both systems will converge on useful features like this.<p>* TypeScript treats null as a bottom type, but Flow uses explicit &quot;maybe types.&quot;",1445375726

Even worse is when discussion sites (<i>cough</i> HN) whisk you away to a whole &#x27;nother page to submit your comment, then dump you back to the thread afterward.<p>* Documentation - Let&#x27;s say you have a long list of topics in a sidebar on the left. If I find a bunch of topics that I want to read and they&#x27;re in the middle of the scroll, I&#x27;ll be annoyed if the whole page refreshes when I click on one.<p>* Forms - If I&#x27;m filling out a long form (like enrolling in school or applying for a job) and I enter something wrong, I want to know immediately. I don&#x27;t want to hit submit, land back on the same page, then find where the error is. Even when sites do this well (by saving the whole state of the form and clearly indicating where the bad field is) it&#x27;s still annoying. Client-side validation also saves server resources (even though you need to do server-side validation too): every time the client catches a validation error, that&#x27;s one less postback the server needs to process.<p>Following the emerging set of best practices (use a CDN, bundle/minify your code with a tool like browserify/webpack, don&#x27;t block the critical render path) is enough to get your code to a point where it should run totally fine on mobile. The horrible state of mobile web performance more often results from:<p>* Fonts - for some reason these seem to take a longer time to load than other assets (or maybe their absence is just more noticable). Using a tool like TypeKit can help to get around issues like &quot;Flash Of Invisible Text&quot;.<p>* Images - People not properly compressing images, using too many images, using PNG where SVG could possibly work are all contributing to slow page loads. Images are usually the largest things on the page (sometimes by an order of magnitude). They are also often demanded by &quot;the business&quot; in the same way that carousels are usually a result of a business compromise and not a deliberate design decision. Tools like grunticon and other gulp/grunt tasks can help mitigate these issues by ensuring that huge hi-res images have a compressed version and don&#x27;t get sent to phones with tiny screens.<p>* Ads - Many ad networks either don&#x27;t run a tight ship or don&#x27;t police the companies who they allow to run code on their client&#x27;s sites. The further someone is from actually owning the page where the code runs, the less they often feel compelled to make good optimization decisions.<p>My point is that a lot of this new-fangled front-end tooling (browserify/webpack, TypeKit, SVG, grunt/gulp, the <picture> element, etc.) are geared towards producing a better experience for the user. Many of them either emerged to deal with mobile web issues or found new importance in light of the problems developers (and businesses) face on the mobile web.",1445375544

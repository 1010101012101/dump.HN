Is there a problem with a wave propagating along the tube with essentially infinite envelope?  Here&#x27;s a nice animation:<p><a href=""http://www.acoustics.org/press/151st/WaveVectorDemosmall.gif"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.acoustics.org/press/151st/WaveVectorDemosmall.gif</a><p>In other words: decompose the standing wave into its forward and backward components and just keep the forward one.  This is not the same thing as the air having a net velocity, so you don&#x27;t bleed all your energy into friction with the walls. (You&#x27;ll still lose some energy as the sound wave is naturally damped by friction due to the residual motion of the air molecules, but this might not be a large effect.)",1375070216

Same day delivery opens up very a different way of thinking about things.  I have a couple thoughts though:<p>1)  I currently feel guilty because its so easy to just buy one thing at a time, and theres nothing stopping me from doing it, that I end up making micropurchases. I wish Google would either prevent this or say &quot;Oh its fine we use all electric vehicles any way.&quot;<p>2) I&#x27;m curious what their pricing plan is going to be like.  I&#x27;ve compared the service to instacart which has minimum delivery amounts to avoid delivery fees.  Google Express looks to be going more along the lines of an Amazon Prime type membership, where one price gets you unlimited deliveries.  I don&#x27;t know if they&#x27;ll end up with this though.<p>3) Groceries!  I would love to be able to buy produce, dairy, etc from Google Express.<p>4) I wish the delivery windows could be tighter...

This treats your end-to-end delivery capability as a syatem and one that should not be  overburdened.<p>The clearest sign of being overburdened is when you have a lot of work in progress but nothing to show for it.  So instead of a genius PM/business analyst/product owner handling out a tome of requirwments from on high with a thud, you break the work down into a minimally useful / marketable chunks, minimize work in progress, deliver according to some priority, and iterate and learn from the results.<p>This is the philsophical foundation of lean Startups (customer development), lean development, and much of the work on Devops.<p>So the article rails against Kanban ... And almost seems like its advocating for the same thing with its goal-driven approach to delivery (?).<p>Any methodology or process framework is subject to misinterpretation or abuse.  This is why &quot;agile&quot; and &quot;scrum&quot; are dirty words to many - it&#x27;s hard to tell what you&#x27;re getting, as the term has been twisted to suit vested interests.   It looks like it is Lean and Kanban&#x27;s turn to be trashed due to ersatz versions being forced on teams.<p>But articles like this aren&#x27;t helpful unless they explain what they mean Kanban, and what aspects are ineffective - clichs like &quot;software is different&quot; don&#x27;t illuminate.",1375069692

Denigrating motherhood is not the way for a people to last the aeons of time. I believe the future of the West is profoundly more conservative than the present, because Darwin. Liberalism is a suicidal ideology.<p>It doesn&#x27;t really work like that.  India has over 1 billion people, and I&#x27;m sure &quot;traditional&quot; lower caste women there &quot;breed above replacement rates&quot; as you put it.<p>On the other side you might have an upper middle class, white, historically mainline Protestant couple living in the US.  Both have a sibling, both have advanced degrees, both have parents who went to college.  Their families have slowly been acquiring wealth for generations.  The couple will have two &quot;replacement rate&quot; kids.<p>On the other hand, the lower caste Indian woman has more than one child die in infancy.  The family does not always have enough food to eat every day.<p>Yet in your mind, the Indian family is a winner because of &quot;Darwin&quot;, because the western liberals have a &quot;suicidal ideology&quot;.  But who would doubt the upper middle class American son would not want to trade places with the Indian kid, and there&#x27;s a much more significant chance that the Indian kid would trade places with the white kid.<p>You seem to see some &quot;contempt&quot; and a &quot;misogynist&quot; tone in the parent which I do not.  You&#x27;re advocating a way of life and morality and such that belongs to history, and to rural farmers in that history.  The US is losing its industrial jobs never mind its agricultural jobs.  Traditional life in the US is Michael Moore&#x27;s &quot;Roger & Me&quot; vision of 1950s blue collar unionized industrial workers driving their cars back to the suburbs.  A way of life going away with Detroit&#x27;s bankruptcy.  Your vision of women only raising kids, and more than two as you say, is not traditional, it&#x27;s almost ancient tradition.  It&#x27;s like, Pennsylvania farmers circa late 17th century.  The Amish and Mennonites in Pennyslvania live like you&#x27;re talking.  But most of America considers it rather antiquated.",1375069572

I haven&#x27;t worked in those teams so I have no way to say is it because of Kanban or is it because of management misunderstanding kanban.<p>From your article, the main reason touted is that the Marketing loses it&#x27;s way. Which to me sounds strange! In fact I have seen it the otherways. We effectively delink marketing cadence from engineering cadence! Thus resulting in derisking the whole big bang releases.<p>For e.g. Marketing decides that they are going to make a big marketing push on a conference or a tradeshow. So the PM come up with a list of features they will showcase for the given event. (say 10 features are decided upon).\nThe engineering team works on these features as a que. Releasing each of these as and when they are done. But do note an engineering release to production does not mean a marketing release. This allows the PM to experiment on features, build up case studies, etc ... for these features.<p>And as the marketing releases dates come closer, everybody knows that we always have a working copy with only the pending items in the que. \nThis results in a high confidence level within the marketing / engineering on what is being touted about. There are no last minute scramble to get a working system. etc ... The most valuable feature was heavily tested and used by everyone before the big bang marketing release.<p>It also allows the PM to make A/B experiments before the actual marketing push. Thus adding another confidence layer to the whole process.<p>In a worst case scenario the least valuable features never get released for the marketing push.<p>I see this as an effective way to derisk the whole marketing push and reduce their dependency on the engineering team to deliver stuff when they said they would.",1375068117

I appreciate your thoughts and the idea that engineers should own large components of a project or entire projects resonates with us.

A tuple is traditionally an ordered list where the positions may or may not be assigned a name. When we assign names to the positions, we tend to call them &quot;records&quot;. In other words the tuple [30, &quot;Bob&quot;] and the record {age: 30, name: &quot;Bob&quot;} are equivalent.<p>One language that prominently relies on tuples with unnamed fields, in the absence of a built-in record syntax, is Erlang. The downside to not having names is that to find a value you must know its position, which hides information in the implementation (refactoring the code in a way that changes the position, for example, might not result in a compile-time error), which is one reason that Haskell provides syntactic sugar for expressing tuple types using a record syntax.<p>One thing that Go does right is to sometimes allow you to address a record as a tuple:<p><pre><code>    var x SomeRecord = {1, &quot;Bob&quot;}\n</code></pre>\nHowever, when reading, I believe (I haven&#x27;t actually checked) you can&#x27;t access a record variable as a tuple.",1375068011

If you miss the first one, then you still have to speed up or you&#x27;re going to miss the second one too.<p>There&#x27;s definitely an optimal timing that takes the minimum amount of energy to accelerate and synchronize with the &quot;sweet spot&quot; of the wave; beginners need to paddle early and paddle hard, whereas an expert has a better feel for it and will exploit his or her experience with the timing to expend less effort catching a wave.<p>When you surf, paddling up to speed and the timing will make or break catching a <i>particular</i> wave - which is very important is the &quot;good waves&quot; are rarer. With an acoustic loop, it&#x27;s may be more predictable, but you still probably want to get it right the first time, while you&#x27;re still in the main accelerator section of the tube.",1375067047

The issue is there is way to many things going on at the same time.<p>Often alternative medicine suggests a diet change and that can be far more useful than you might think.  Could be the new diet adds stuff your missing or you old diet included things that where bad for you.  In the second case they could suggest you eat pizza and donuts which actually helps. Many things are stress related so a little hope and a better mindset can be extremely useful.  Other times it&#x27;s an environmental hazard that goes away because some plaint up river changed their process and stopped dumping XYZ.<p>The point of all that is clinical trials are necessary.

Intelligent men who spend the time figuring out the law. And like anything, practice makes perfect. So sure, you could learn to interpret the law, but are you going to waste your time?<p>There are also big reasons why you don&#x27;t want to represent yourself. Objectivity is paramount.

9087545,comment,9086751,9087301,0,0,geofft,,,"Docker doesn&#x27;t directly do cross-platform: the Docker API is the Linux kernel userspace API. If you want to run Dockerized apps on OS X or Windows, then you&#x27;re using boot2docker, which is a distribution of Linux running inside a VM.<p>So most of the question is whether you&#x27;re happy with this as a distribution mechanism. The best you&#x27;ll be able to do is something like VMware&#x27;s Unity mode, which isn&#x27;t <i>bad</i>, but isn&#x27;t good either. Alternatively, you could run an X11 server on Windows (via Cygwin) and OS X (Xdarwin), but that&#x27;s also going to look very non-native.<p>If you&#x27;re not, then there&#x27;s an open technical problem of how to make it look reasonable. I&#x27;d consider whether browser-based desktop apps are an option: you can require a recent Chrome or Firefox, come up with three common launchers for each platform (think PhoneGap), and then run the Linux backend inside a VM on Windows and OS X. But that seriously restricts the set of apps that are in scope, and at that point, you might also try just building a cross-platform backend (using Go, maybe?).",1424562993

Look, everything done in that situation was a dickish thing, but Adria got dumped on in every exchange.<p>1. Guys enjoy a bit of innuendo without having the common sense to figure that it is inappropriate in the middle of a hall (quiet or not) at a professional conference. That&#x27;s not cool.<p>2. Adria takes a photo and calls out the guys doing it to her followers on Twitter. That&#x27;s not cool either.<p>3. A bunch of self-righteous twitter folks decide to make &quot;Hank&quot; pay, and tweet his boss demanding his job. Ugh.<p>4. His employers then fire him. WTF?<p>5. Internet shitstorm of epic proportion lands on Adria, rape and death threats, doxing, a DDoS attack on her employer, who is blackmailed to fire her. WTactualF?<p>I don&#x27;t think anyone comes out of that smelling of roses. But &quot;Hank&quot; and Adria&#x27;s misdemenours were pretty minor &quot;could have done that better&quot; or &quot;could have been more considerate&quot; stuff. There&#x27;s no reason to assume any malice aforethought in either of them.<p>And more to the point, whatever &quot;Hank&quot; suffered, Adria was dumped on tenfold. So unsympathetic or not, we should all be really angry at the way Adria was treated. To suggest it her is <i>attitude</i> that hurts equality in tech is pretty low, I think. And, those of us who haven&#x27;t been professionally assaulted, and personally threatened and hounded, should probably cut her a break before accusing her of doing it for profit.",1424562771

9087493,comment,9086751,9087451,0,0,geofft,,,"I spent a few years working on general-purpose security sandboxing for Linux desktop apps (as a master&#x27;s thesis), and gave up. The problem is that there are a bunch of common-sense things like not giving access to the root filesystem, and a million less common-sense things that <i>also</i> give you the ability to escape the sandbox. It really sucks.<p>There&#x27;s X11, as Alex mentioned. If you grant permissions to an app to use the X11 socket, it has the ability to inject keystrokes to any other application in the same X session. If you have a terminal open where you run &quot;sudo&quot;, then the app can gain root.<p>Your gparted example gives the app access to the root partition. This allows it the ability to modify anything on the drive without going through the filesystem&#x27;s security layer. It can go change root&#x27;s password, modify setuid binaries, etc. It can then flush the disk cache by reading a lot of something else, ensuring that the next time the kernel wants to check root&#x27;s password, it won&#x27;t be cached.<p>Also, the state of the Linux kernel is such that if an app is running as UID 0 (even within a container), it probably has the ability to exploit some subtlety in the kernel interface to gain root. This is much reduced if you&#x27;re using user namespaces (which, AIUI, Docker is not yet using), but it&#x27;s still a risk. It&#x27;s a huge risk without user namespaces.<p>If you trust the app, then you don&#x27;t need an app (security) sandbox, which I think is what Alex is saying: &quot;This is not sandboxing.&quot; If you don&#x27;t trust the app, then Docker will not effectively restrict what the app can do to your system.",1424561747

        (a) Substances that are added to a food during the
        processing of such food but are removed in some
        manner from the food before it is packaged in its
        finished form.

        (b) Substances that are added to a food during
        processing, are converted into constituents normally
        present in the food, and do not significantly
        increase the amount of the constitutents naturally
        found in the food.

        (c) Substances that are added to a food for their
        technical or functional effect in the processing but
        are present in the finished food at insignificant
        levels and do not have any technical or functional
        effect in that food.

I have not seen anything that says that it means to have a &quot;technical or functional effect&quot;.<p>Speaking of food labeling, I just last night noticed something odd at Domino&#x27;s. Here is what they list on their site as the ingredients in their garlic dipping sauce:<p><pre><code>    Soybean Oil, Hydrogenated Soybean Oil, Salt, Natural Flavor,
    Soy Lecithin, Artificial Flavor, Beta Carotene (Color).
</code></pre>
I can&#x27;t help but notice that their &quot;garlic&quot; dipping sauce has no listed ingredient that has any obvious connection to garlic.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cdrh/cfdocs/cfcfr/CFRSearch.cfm?fr=101.100"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cdrh/cfdocs/cfcfr/CFRS...</a>",1424561703

First year felt very academic. Worked irregular hours. Weren&#x27;t sure what we were supposed to be doing. Lots of research. Lots of change (relocated from Boston to the Bay Area). The whole time we didn&#x27;t really think we were building a company, we thought we were researching an interesting problem and seeing if we could come up with solutions for it.<p>Pre-October 2010: &quot;Playing Company&quot; / We&#x27;d raised money at the end of 2009 and hired our first employees and moved into our first office in Palo Alto in Jan 2010. I&#x27;d take the train from SF every morning answering emails on my iPad on the way down and playing Angry Birds (for a stint I was among the top ranked players in the US) on the return. We struggled to get our first 100 beta users and took the whole team to Vegas when we did. We weren&#x27;t sure exactly what we were building and sometimes the uncertainty made me anxious but generally this was a fun time. The 60 days before we launched at TechCrunch Disrupt on Sept 27th were stressful but fun and incredibly productive. Everyone had a clear goal and date it needed to be done by.<p>Personally, I was wearing many hats (occasional coder, biz dev, and primary customer support) and nearly 100% of my time was dedicated to obsessing about CloudFlare. There was still a lot of uncertainty and throughout the course of 2010 there was increasing sense that we had a big opportunity and it was ours to take or screw up.<p>During this time I tried all kinds of tricks to manage my own psyche. Most effective was going to Suchadda Thai Massage near my house every weekend and getting a 90 minute really deep tissue massage that was hard enough that it took my mind off anything other than the knee or elbow being jabbed into my back. I&#x27;d been dating a woman who was an academic for the last two years but had become a pretty terrible boyfriend. Not a surprise that we broke up just after this period.<p>October 2010-December 2011: &quot;Chaos&quot; / We launched. We didn&#x27;t get around to putting on any limits on who could sign up so anyone and everyone did. Thousands signed up in the first few days. Every signup increased the traffic across our network. There were only 8 of us and we were running a 24x7 network. I lost the ability to sleep for more than about 2 hours at a time. My phone would buzz with every network issue. At the same time, it was fun to see that things were generally working. Customer attention lead to investor attention and the relationship with investors shifted from us pitching them to them pitching us. I wasn&#x27;t doing any more coding and spent much more of my time managing potential investors and trying to recruit. We moved the office to San Francisco within a few blocks of my house. Being closer removed the regular routine of the train and, somewhat counter-intuitively, meant I worked longer hours because the last bullet train leaving Palo Alto didn&#x27;t define the end of work anymore.<p>With the lack of predictability came a feeling that every day held a new crisis. One afternoon in the spring of 2010 we got word some group called Lulz Security had signed up. Then the media started calling. We had no idea who Lulzsec was. I stayed in the office well past midnight reading Twitter and articles on the group and trying to figure out what to do. I only went home when I got spooked sitting in our dark office and thought I heard someone. I headed home only to be awakened by a call from my co-founder. Turned out someone had broken in and four laptops had been stolen. I raced back to the office and a bunch of us holed up on a conference room and debated (seriously) whether it was the hackers, law enforcement, or some corporate espionage agent who had broken into the office. That&#x27;s how crazy life felt. Turned out the truth held fall less intrigue: it was a simple burglar who had broken into several other offices and was caught several months later.<p>I started dating a cancer surgeon. She lived on the other side of San Francisco and had a similarly chaotic schedule. We&#x27;d find time to get dinner a couple nights a week and exchange stories about the chaos in each others&#x27; lives. Having nothing in common almost felt like a virtue for a time as we could both provide each other an escape.<p>2012 - 2013: &quot;Growing&quot; / We built up the start of a competent team and things began to feel more stable. I started to attend more external events and spend more time outside the office. Started attending more conferences. Telling the CloudFlare story more broadly. I started writing regularly for our blog, largely telling stories about technical challenges we&#x27;d faced and how we solved them.<p>Being more of a public figure made me more of a target. Some of our less savory users, or the hackers trying to take down the sites we protected, decided to mess with me from time to time. I&#x27;d been pretty casual with the personal details of my life. It wasn&#x27;t hard to find my cell phone number or home address. One night at 4:00am I had the SWAT team called on my home. Thankfully they rang the buzzer rather than breaking down the door. At the office, we regularly had bomb threats phoned in. We became pretty good friends with Maggie the bomb sniffing dog. Our Board suggested that I should have personal security, especially when traveling, which seemed absurd given how small a company we were. It also didn&#x27;t thrill my quite private physician girlfriend. Having nothing in common started to be more of a liability and we broke up.<p>2014 - Today: &quot;Real CEO&quot; / Today I have three jobs: recruiting, external affairs, internal affairs. I spend about equal time on each. We&#x27;re hiring about 3 people a week at this point and I still talk with all of them to answer their questions and try and judge whether they&#x27;ll be a cultural fit. External affairs involves speaking to customers, investors, analysts, bankers, media, etc. Internal affairs involves a bit of product strategy but mostly managing people and team dynamics. Talking with CEOs of public companies that are far ahead of where we are today, my sense is this will be my role for the rest of my time leading CloudFlare.<p>My work day is pretty tightly scheduled but I have quite a bit of control of that schedule. I don&#x27;t have a lot of downtime during the day which has made it harder to find time to do things at work I used to really enjoy, like writing technical blog posts. I find myself much more playing what Jeff Bezos, CEO of Amazon, described as &quot;switchboard operator&quot;: taking some input of an idea and routing it to the right person on our team. It&#x27;s rare that I write an email that&#x27;s more than a couple sentences anymore. It surprises me every day to walk into the office and see so many people. We&#x27;ve passed the Dunbar Number of employees and it&#x27;s hard that I don&#x27;t have a personal relationship with everyone on the team. Soon I won&#x27;t know everyone&#x27;s name. We&#x27;ve tried to keep the organization very flat, in order to ensure that we&#x27;re the kind of place where the best idea will win, and I am surprised whenever I hear someone hesitates to &quot;waste my time&quot; with something because I&#x27;m &quot;the CEO.&quot; I try to stay approachable but see how that inherently gets more difficult over time.<p>I&#x27;m getting better at taking time for myself, secure in knowing there&#x27;s a great team handling things better than I could myself. As a fellow founder said recently, the job of CEO is to fire yourself from every job within the company -- and replace yourself with someone more competent. I like that and think it&#x27;s right.<p>I&#x27;m proud of the fact that the three of us that co-founded the company are all still at the company and are all still friends who respect each other. That&#x27;s very rare. Our story would make for a very boring book. Other personal relationships are sometimes difficult. You lose a lot of friends along the process of starting a company -- largely because I haven&#x27;t made time to keep up the relationships. At the same time, I&#x27;ve met a lot of great new people who I think will develop into meaningful, long-term friends. Dating presents a real puzzle -- but that&#x27;s a whole other topic for another time.<p>Looking ahead we&#x27;re likely on the path to being a public company and I&#x27;m trying to spend as much time talking with other newly public CEOs about how that changes their lifestyle. For now, I count myself fortunate that I can take a few hours on a sunny Saturday morning in San Francisco and, on a whim, sit down and write an answer to this question and not have to send it my our compliance department to ensure it doesn&#x27;t contain any forward-looking statements.",1424561431

A bore obstruction during firing is very dangerous, as it results in the chamber pressure exceeding design limits, which may cause a catastrophic failure of the weapon. Misfires are usually due to defective ammunition or a failure to hit the primer hard enough (hammer or striker spring too weak, firing pin too short or the chamber or ammunition having incorrect dimensions).<p><i>One, it is a hell of a recoil</i><p>Almost all semi-automatic handguns are recoil-operated, including .22 rimfires, which are known for having almost no recoil. Generating enough force to cycle the action is not at all difficult; the major difficulty in handgun design was actually the converse: keeping the action from cycling too quickly. Using a heavier slide and stiffer spring is one option, but it becomes unattractive with anything but low-powered cartridges. Most pistols designed for police, military and self defense, using medium-power cartridges like 9mm and .45 auto use a locked breech action like the 1911 shown here. It and its prototypes were the first to use the tilting barrel mechanism which is found on most pistols today.<p>The alternative to recoil operation is gas operation, in which a port in the barrel diverts some of the propellant gasses to push on a piston to operate the mechanism. It is common for rifles, which typically use more powerful, higher-pressure ammunition than pistols, but rarely found on pistols. The Desert Eagle is a notable exception.<p>The .45&#x27;s recoil is not generally considered severe. Most people find it milder than the .40 S&W cartridge used by the majority of US police today, itself developed as a milder-recoiling version of the 10mm auto cartridge.<p><i>Two, it only works if you don&#x27;t let the gun go backwards, if you shoot, and allow it to go back, the energy of the recoil will be spent by your body, not the slide, thus the slide won&#x27;t slide, thus you will have to slide manually... Making it very non-semi-auto.</i><p>Failing to hold the gun firmly is known as &quot;limp-wristing&quot; and does increase the chances of a malfunction. Most modern pistols will still cycle in spite of it, but the chances of malfunction are increased. Inertia usually provides enough counter force for the recoil to push against.<p><i>Also I noticed the ejector also rely on some small machined parts (like the one that hold the cartridge rim), and thus if not made properly will probably fail (the slide will go back but the cartridge won&#x27;t go back with it, this probably would be the sort of jam that is an actual jam, you would need to push the cartridge out with another object).</i><p>This is called a failure to extract. It&#x27;s a common cause of malfunctions. Most newer pistol designs, including many revised 1911s used a much larger extractor that protrudes from the side of the slide.<p><i>And the amount of springs I am seeing around, mean cyclic fatigue failure of the metal probably causes a couple of issues, I think that a frequently fired gun probably more than cleaning also might require frequent change of springs.</i><p>Correct. Replacement of the recoil spring every few thousand rounds is a good idea to reduce fatigue on other parts. As the spring weakens, the forces experienced by other parts are increased. This is more of a problem in some designs than others. The Beretta 92/M9 used by the US military, for example uses a tilting locking block instead of a tilting barrel, and the locking block is prone to fail if the spring is not replaced on schedule. Most pistols are less prone to this category of failure, and some would consider it a design flaw of the Beretta.",1424561136

9087457,comment,9087078,9087316,0,0,icegreentea,,,"Agreed. For the benefit of those who don&#x27;t know, blowback and locked breached operations are the two primary operating methods of semi-auto pistol actions. In a blowback action, the recoil spring and mass of slide is sufficient to keep the breech closed until after the bullet as left the barrel. It&#x27;s important to wait for the bullet to leave, so that pressure can sufficiently decrease, you else you might get all sorts of nasty stuff - like the casing bursting and possibly damaging the weapon and/or the shooter.<p>Blowback is appropriate for lower power rounds. As power increases, the mass of slide and stiffness of spring must increase, and at some point may become impractical. So for locked breech actions, some other mechanism is used to lock the breech closed until after the bullet as left the barrel.<p>In the case of the 1911, is the combination of the locking lugs and and the pivoting link. The locking lugs lock the barrel into the slide, so that when fired the barrel and slide initially travel together rearwards. The pivoting link (that thing behind the recoil spring) allows the entire barrel to drop down as it travels backwards. As it drops, the lugs disengage with the slide, allowing the slide the continue to the rear and open the breech. All of this is calculated so that the pressure is safe when this occurs.<p>There are a variety of ways to do locked breech. The 1911&#x27;s action (tilting barrel) is particularly influential.",1424561018

They fold hard.<p>If you really want to break in, I would be honest with what you can do. There&#x27;s no shame in being self taught. Use that trait as a strength to show your capability and interest to learn new things. That you&#x27;re autonomous and motivated. Talk about how you were able to learn new things or how you were the driving force behind something. Don&#x27;t be afraid to take a smaller role and listen to others. Your coworkers are assets not ladders for you to climb over. And most importantly, work with smarter people. Soon enough you&#x27;ll learn that you&#x27;re actually not that talented... or maybe you really are. Good luck.",1424560086

As the &quot;business&quot; founder (although I make a few commits every week as well) I sought clients out, and we found a medium sized retailer who had some backend issues almost by accident. We became their DBA for 100k USD a year each [2]  (something we have a collective decade experience in) plus a work permit so we could live there, working half time. We spend the other half working on our idea, which turned out to be a good thing because the two AI problems core to our success took a bit longer than planned to be solved (our 40+ competitors all use humans).<p>I save around 50-60% of my salary, fly to exotic countries at least monthly (typing this from Australia, going to Japan in 3 weeks) without having to take leave, I live in a nice flat in the centre of town (next to the President&#x27;s house) in a first world city with nice weather, I never have to wear a suit, and best of all, we don&#x27;t answer to anybody because the client treats us as expert consultants, not an employee (there is a significant difference!) and we don&#x27;t have investors and won&#x27;t need any. The chilled out nature of an easy DBA job with good (enough) money means we can do research properly and build a good quality product. I have to say, whilst I understand PG&#x27;s dislike of bootstrapping vs taking investor money (and it makes sense when your idea is new and first mover advantage is important)... well, it&#x27;s a really nice way to start up I think. YMMV. I think financial freedom, and freedom from irrational management techniques designed to control you and not just your output, is by far the highest quality of life improvement I ever made.<p>[1] There is some fuzziness here about the terms of the visa from the gov. Technically, you&#x27;re supposed to work for only one employer; that is, you can&#x27;t just work part time and build your own business with the other half, nor have a split company visa. In practice, a lot of people do it and the government is very pro-entrepreneurship; but I&#x27;m not leaving a paper trail just in case.<p>[2] Cost of living and taxes are quite low here, so in SF terms that&#x27;s probably equivalent to 200k.",1424559916

H.S. Diploma<p>2. Worked help desk and wiring jobs for 15 years with little to no upward career progression<p>3. No particular portfolio of work you can point to<p>4. Personally, given this background, you&#x27;ve ended up with a new family. I don&#x27;t know if you&#x27;re struggling to support them or not, but I&#x27;m guessing with help desk jobs it&#x27;s probably a struggle.<p>All this together can read to a hiring managers as &quot;not responsible or forward thinking enough to trust with a chance. May not actually know how to do the kind of long-term hard work I need for more senior/higher paying positions.&quot;<p>Even with a change in any of those four bullet points, you would read as a better candidate.<p>1. College degree instead of H.S. Diploma<p>2. Upward career progression<p>3. A portfolio of work<p>4. Family issues are not part of the conversation since your personal issues are not the hiring manager&#x27;s concern, this bullet doesn&#x27;t even exist.<p>I&#x27;m not saying you need to have all 4, but any improvement in any of them would help. You don&#x27;t have to have a college degree if your 15 years of experience showed a progression in roles and responsibilities. Or none of that would matter if you had a bunch of awesome projects up someplace for an employer to look at.<p>Or with no changes in 2,3 or 4, in 15 years it never occurred to you to go hit the local community college and start on what might even look like a degree path? (I say this one with lots of authority since I was once in a similar situation as you, but I finally got the clue after only 4 years of suffering in shitty jobs).<p>You can&#x27;t change #1 quickly, even if you started today, that would be years of hard work. Harder than you can realize right now (I&#x27;m speaking from personal experience)<p>#2 might be a framing issue, you might need to rethink how you present your prior work so that if there was any kind of increase in roles and responsibility it&#x27;s reflected in your work history (and in how you present yourself during interviews.<p>#3 is also long-term, but even some github projects that do automatic security audits or test for vulnerabilities, things that a few weeks of learning shell scripts or python could probably get you, those would be huge on your resume. Being able to talk intelligently about those things during an interview would be even better.<p>#4 here&#x27;s some tough talk. Your personal issues are of no concern to prospective employers. They honestly don&#x27;t care, and anything they know about is likely to make them concerned about your reliability as a corporate asset.<p>#5 Finally, certificates are touchy things, they might open some doors, but not as many as just having a college degree would. Most certifications are barely worth the paper they&#x27;re printed on. If you are really interested in computer security (a very good, fast growing industry with excellent pay and plentiful job openings waiting for you to apply) you need to get into a college degree program and work towards at least a B.S. in Computer Science, Computer Security or Information Systems and then get CISSP certified.<p>Here&#x27;s some even tougher talk, to even be considered for a CISSP <i>certificate</i> you have to have had 5 years of 40-hour/wk work experience in 2 of 10 work domains. <a href=""https://www.isc2.org/cissp-domains/default.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.isc2.org/cissp-domains/default.aspx</a> This is the level of candidate that professionals in the field are looking for, full-stop.<p>You can also become an Associate of (ISC)2 and you&#x27;ll then have six years to get the necessary experience. <a href=""https://www.isc2.org/associates/default.aspx"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.isc2.org/associates/default.aspx</a><p>If that&#x27;s too much, remember an employer is going to think &quot;this guy can&#x27;t even commit to a real certification program, why should I hire him?&quot;. Scout job postings you want, and look at the requirements, that&#x27;s your guide for what is being looked for. Talent is not one of them.<p>If this is what you want, you need to start <i>today</i> and do everything necessary to make it happen. You&#x27;re 15 years behind at this point. But you can make it up.<p>If this is all too much, you might rethink and go a different direction. A portfolio of tools, a blog on your topic of interest, participation in communities of interest (start networking <i>NOW</i>) all need to be there when you apply for that next, better, job.<p>#6: okay really finally. You need to start thinking in terms of career and not job. A job is where you go exchange labor for money. You go from job to job, the pay might be better, it might be worse, but they aren&#x27;t building blocks that get you anywhere in particular. A career is a tower, each place you work gives you building material for that tower and you slowly build up as high as you&#x27;re capable of going. Jobs are what you do when you&#x27;re just out of highschool and looking to score some gas money. Careers are what you do to prepare for eventual retirement and raise a family.<p>I know I&#x27;m being harsh, but I know lots of guys in your same place and can&#x27;t seem to connect the dots, even after decades of walking in place.",1424559868

I wonder how likely those for whom iPads are the only computing device <i>today</i> are to ever think of using the 'production tools' specific to the PC though.<p>Or is it simply that the iPad makes so much consumption so easy  on a PC NOTHING is very easy to do in comparison. It's a little bit like the idea that TV only is for kicking back, even though you can make very difficult content for it too  all creators exlore the nature of their medium/device, whether it be developers or content producers!<p>iMovie - plenty of amazing music-making apps in addition to Garageband  and an increasing number of outlining apps, OmniOutliner, productivity apps like OmniFocus  seem to suggest that appmakers are still only starting to explore what can be done with this new UI and what the usage scenarios are for this device. They're different!<p>TODAY, most of the apps existing presume that you have a PC, and indeed, until iOS 5  soon coming out  you need a PC for backups and various device management tasks. That PC dependence will end, and with it maybe most of the need for tablets to be defined as complementary 'consumption' devices. How file management will work with apps in the iCloud is only about to start to get worked out. Indeed, looking at how the iCloud works suggests their vision of how people will use their various devices together  it's still quite untried!<p>So, I'd not say tablets are doomed to be for consumption  it's more of a market dynamics question, like you note, together with technology just getting created. It's really about what gets explored. And one can hardly say that the app store model can't be successful for those who want to create something new.<p>I'm hopeful  and also did some of my best work at that time on a Psion Series 5, back in 1998. For editing, the touch interface, with a stylus and a keyboard, turned out superior to desktop word processing - at least to me.<p>What we're getting away from is maybe the idea that work is done at a desktop  something that still lived on with laptops. It will partly be a sort of 'self-conscious' loop of what is possible to be done  what we make possible to be done  and how convenient and productive these tools then turn out.

Recently in June, it was getting so what I believe to be a lot traffic and growing. Growing 30%/mo since January, we hit a high of 250,000 uniques/mo in July.<p>My co-founder and I quit our jobs to work on it full time, and to grow it out, but now after the summer the site traffic has declined. It seems I quit my job when it ""peaked"", maybe this site was a passing fad? This month I only got 167,000 uniques -- a 35% drop.<p>So here I am. I'm not sure what to do. Should I shelf it, or take this as a sign and just give up? I told myself I'd try one more month to turn the traffic again towards a positive track, but I'm running out of savings and running out of ideas on how to turn the traffic.<p>I guess what I'm looking for is advice from those in my situation before -- did you shelf your project, or just keep working on it? I want to keep working on it, but I also want to make sure my reality is in check and that I'm not deluded by my own hope for it to grow bigger. How do you know when to quit?",1315018123

You can't buy your way out of trouble, by putting your db on a dedicated server with fast drives and tonnes of RAM. You can't really use relational data without performance and reliability issues.<p>It's not just about the ""app engine way"". It's not like learning C or Haskell, and having to find a new way to write the code. You fundamentally cannot do big ad-hoc database operations.<p>And consider this - it was July last year that they introduced the MapperAPI. Before then, I don't think you could do Map-Reduce without manually re-implementing it yourself (on top of the cantankerous Appengine Datastore). Just think about that for a minute - how were you meant to do stuff the Appengine way without map-reduce?<p>Anyway, I don't think your credibility was ""utterly destroyed"". It was really hard to know whether or not the learning curve was worth climbing until you had tried. You just had to judge the book by its cover, and the ""Google"" brand is pretty compelling to an engineer. It's not the first time someone has been fooled into buying something because the provider has a good reputation.",1315016372

And android tablets haven't been doing well anyway (20:80), even the very best of them. The 3G kindle's tailoring is:<p>- free 3G (yes, free), to buy amazon books<p>- black and white E-Ink which is much closer to paper than colour displays.<p>- much lighter and slimmer (241grams; 8.5oz)<p>- long battery life (2 months - about x60 longer than a tablet), though this  probably overshoots the need. i.e. they'd be better off using a smaller battery (or even AA batteries).<p>I'm so impressed with the Kindle because it resists trying to be the best at everything, but instead makes comprises that optimize it for its purpose.

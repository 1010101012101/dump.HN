They act as a strong deterrent to any country considering an invasion thus allowing NK to reduce the size of its standing army as well as spending on traditional weaponry and military hardware.<p>The North Korean leadership isn&#x27;t capable of decisions like this based on mature, rational thought. More likely, they spend the money on nukes because we told them they can&#x27;t have any, and no one tells the Kims no.<p>As an example of their immature behavior, there was a guy in charge of their agricultural department who built a series of farms that produced record harvests when Kim Jong Il was still around. Kim then demanded that they cut down large swaths of forests in the surrounding area and turn everything into farms, to replicate the successes. The next time they had a Tsunami, the deforestation caused all of the farms to flood and be destroyed.

They were not, and suggested that the Secret Service might be more appropriate. The Secret Service was also not interested.

6961757,comment,6961263,6961718,6,0,com2kid,,,"> I would be surprised if this is true, unless you can&#x27;t read. Usually the reverse is true.<p>I, and many other students, pre-read our mathematics text before class started.<p>It was of about 0 usefulness. I&#x27;d say maybe 10%-15% comprehension.<p>Steps to solve a problem were always cut out, and always seemingly the ones that we needed most to see. Example problems were either too complex or too simple. And explanations of complex topics were poorly written all around.<p>A <i>good</i> professor comes in, sees where we are having problems at. Discusses the topics in ways we can relate to, helps guide us down the path of understanding. Demonstrates techniques on the board at various levels of difficulty, ensuring we can see not only how is an idea applied to a trivial problem, but also how it is applied within a larger framework as well.<p>I am someone who loves to read, and who learns really well from reading. But when it comes to math I don&#x27;t think I ever got any comprehension from a mathematics textbook by itself. Typically after a lecture was given, maybe 80% of the book would make sense. Sometimes, on a few chapters, 100%. Eventual understanding of what the book said came only after mastery of the technique, from which I could work backwards to figure out what the book was doing.<p>Then there is the fact that applying a concept is a huge part of understanding it. Application and practice are what take a shakily understood idea that will be soon forgotten and turn it into an understanding of a new way of thinking that will stick with the student for life.<p>A good professor can see what areas of understanding their class is struggling with and assign problems appropriately, helping to ensure that students come away from their schooling with life long knowledge.<p>And of course on top of this there remains the fact that different people have different abilities of reading. One of the smartest people I know is dyslexic, it is faster for him to have someone else read the text to him than for him to read it himself!<p>Naturally I know people who were able to just read their math textbook and understand everything in it. Kudos to them! For the rest of the students though, who were all actively asking questions and engaging with the professors during classes, it seems that they most certainly gained value out of class lectures!<p>Indeed, office hours were also popular. The typical rule in study groups I attended was we&#x27;d spend 2-3 hours trying to understand a concept together before we marked it down as &quot;ask the professor about it&quot;.",1387932454

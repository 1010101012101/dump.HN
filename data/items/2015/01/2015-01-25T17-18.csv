The gradual adoption would make most sense through the growth of closed systems where there are almost zero human drivers. Will the cars be like small public transit or are they single ride and not picking up random passengers along the way for the sake of efficiency (for the companies providing the rides surely electric cars and more single rides will yield greater monetary gains)? The social impact would be interesting - I&#x27;ve had good experiences meeting and talking with Uber drivers.

I agree with you completely that KA is far from a &quot;global&quot; player. It&#x27;s interesting you mentioned Vietnam there because I have actually been building a kind of KA clone here in Vietnam for the last ~2 years or so. And here&#x27;s my analysis when I started it.<p>- A very large percentage of Vietnamese students wouldn&#x27;t be able to understand KA&#x27;s videos because of their English proficiency.<p>- Even if the content was translated & subtitled, the videos&#x27; topics were in a way &quot;foreign&quot; to most of the students, especially the K1-K12&#x27;s videos<p>- Other players like Udacity, Coursera ,... mainly focused on specific topics and that will be more relevant to Vietnamese students/workers, say software developers. But again, it&#x27;s only relevant to  those students with pretty good understanding of their field&#x27;s terminologies in English. Those students are the minority.<p>- Say, if I were to start a trello&#x27;s clone, I would have little chance against trello because most of Vietnamese would be able to use trello with out any problems, so yeah, they might prefer trello.<p>So starting a KA clone would be &quot;safer&quot;. And on top of that, I&#x27;ve always been passionate about software & education & English language, so I started it. I started with English courses, which I thought were what the Vietnamese students would need most in their career later in life.<p>So in case anyone thinking of making a KA clone like me, please read on. It&#x27;s not an easy journey at all, especially when your resources are limited. Building the platform AND the content at the same time is real tough. It&#x27;s not easy to convince good (English) teachers to go online and give lessons. Giving lessons offline is still fairly lucrative for good English teachers. Or they are shy acting in front of the camera and going to be seen by &quot;everyone&quot;. Or they are not passionate enough a teacher. Or they simply didn&#x27;t believe in us.<p>I haven&#x27;t been successful yet, still struggling but the journey&#x27;s been great and I&#x27;m really proud of what we&#x27;ve built: a stable platform (has most of the features from KA or udacity), found 2 young passionate English teachers and together we&#x27;ve built a few English courses.<p>So yes, that&#x27;s my startup journey so far. The final results? 2015 will tell, right now we&#x27;re running a little short of cash but I&#x27;m hopeful. Sometimes I just wish I was Salman Khan and met &quot;that&quot; investor, Bill Gates. Gates&#x27; note on online education is exactly what I&#x27;ve been thinking as well: It is still at an early stage and improvising for maybe 10 years to come.",1422206961

From there we would see the technology slowly improve to start getting traction in the real world. Even then the vehicle wouldn&#x27;t be fully automated , it would be a more advanced form of the cruise control we have today with it falling back to the manual driver especially in crazy places like India.<p>Also we&#x27;d need laws forbidding people from jumping in front of self driving cars etc just to f@#$ with them.<p>This is also a trend with automation stories in general , with several publications already predicting doom and gloom and claiming that most people would end up unemployed because of automation of their jobs.

The difference, I have come to believe after living here for a few years, stems from a different perspective on long- and short-term interests.<p>Americans are, in general, I think (please note this is my opinion and do not down vote me for making this observation) more likely to support solutions that appear to resolve the given issue in the most intuitive and seemingly fastest way. While the intention may be good, this rather simplistic view contradicts the reality that subtler, research-based and longer-view solutions are often the wiser choice. Examples of this include things like research into prison sentences and conditions and their relation to recidivism rates; or ideas about parental leave being better for businesses in the long term, despite the short term loss of productivity.<p>In this particular case, it is an issue of very short-term thinking from the police who do not realize that their draconian tactics, which seemingly are for the best interest of security today, are in fact more likely to engender civil unrest (or emigration, in my case, since I have no appetite for that) in the long run.",1422206805

From there, the debate split between reasonable people talking about journalistic ethics and ... less reasonable people having disgusting reactions like you&#x27;d get in any heated debate on the internet (especially in a fairly younger demographic).<p>Several gaming news sites involved in the accusations started focusing on the mysoginy part in order to save face and the original issue of journalistic ethics was replaced by a debate on sexism in video games, the lack of female characters etc etc (a debate which, by the way, we regularly have in the gaming community).<p>So no, anti-gg doesn&#x27;t specifically care about journalism ethics.

He was putting down another programmer based on a theoretical mumbo jumbo when he could have proven his theories by actual programming.<p>I think it is obvious that any scientist that can prove his theories in a practical way must do that and should not flame and criticize another. In areas where theories are harder to prove like astrophysics, social science, economics, etc. I guess people can debate and flame. We are all used to economist flame wars by now.<p>But in areas where theories are practically provable, such criticisms are useless and idiotic. If Tanenbaum thought microkernels were so great he should have made a usable microkernel OS.<p>This also shows a very negative practice in the software industry which should be discouraged. And this is the criticism of the thing that is working now in favor of some new shiny project that is still in development but it will be all so great when it comes out. It is a very easy pitfall to get into, because the thing working now usually has some problems and disadvantages while the shiny new thing that does not exist yet is usually perfect in every way. But in practical matters, one usually does better going with the thing working now. But worst of all, this practice of worshiping the nonexistent solution is usually used to strike down newcomers and disruptors.<p>By the way, unikernels have absolutely nothing to do with microkernels. So, no the day of the microkernel has not arrived and there is no indication that it will come any time soon. Maybe there will be a practical working microkernel based os some day. I have no idea what will happen in a thousand years or ten thousand years.

If you have long enough time frame a lot of predictions about the future will eventually happen in one way or another.<p>Regardless, Linus never disputed the fact that microkernels are theoretically better.

these TSA Officials is at the outer boundary of the Fourth
Amendment. Once TSA Officials were satisfied that George
was not armed or carrying explosives, much of the concern
that justified his detention dissipated. However, it did not
totally vanish or suggest that further inquiry was not
warranted. Suspicion remained, and that suspicion was
objectively reasonable given the realities and perils of air
passenger safety. The TSA Officials still were confronted
with an individual who was carrying Arabic-English
flashcards bearing such words as: “bomb,” “terrorist,” “to
kill,” etc. In a world where air passenger safety must contend
with such nuanced threats as attempts to convert underwear
into bombs and shoes into incendiary devices, we think that
the brief detention that followed the initial administrative
search of George was reasonable.

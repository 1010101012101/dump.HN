The taxis here in France are an example of that.  I have never had a single ride that was the correct price, and after many attempts I gave up.  I&#x27;m certainly not alone.

It might be nice to allow it but issue a warning about widening types.<p>As for the others, I kinda disagree. Enums allow for some nice syntax with match. Compare:<p><pre><code>    match error_option { \n         Ok(Some(a)) => {},\n         Ok(None(a)) => {},\n         Err=> {}\n    }\n</code></pre>\nwith<p><pre><code>    match error_option { \n         Error.Ok(Option.Some(a)) => {},\n         Error.Ok(Option.None(a)) => {},\n         Error.Err=> {}\n    }\n</code></pre>\nSee? It would get tedious fast with match pattern.<p>I had never had problems with mut. The syntax is clear and unambiguous. It&#x27;s fine as is really. I actually like knowing which pointers are mutable, by keyword  instead of typing arcane stuff like <i>@~ptr</i>, <i>@&ptr</i>. Seeing how @ was a sigil for pointers this would make most people do a double somersault in fear of the GC pointer returning.<p>I like macros with ! It tells you magic happens here beware.

7049648,comment,7049545,7049545,22,0,tikhonj,,,"For reference, the 15-minute law mentioned in the article is a restriction that companies like Uber have to force their customers to wait at least 15 minutes before getting a ride. Given that the average black car gets to a customer in 7 minutes, this is a <i>serious</i> handicap. [1]<p>This sort of law feels really backwards. It degrades the service of companies like Uber <i>and</i> imposes negative externalities on society--more cars pointlessly idling and waiting around, more traffic congestion and so on. The idea behind a market is to <i>improve</i> quality; trying to &quot;improve&quot; the market by arbitrarily degrading the quality of some competitors is exactly counter-productive.<p>Given that the taxis have gotten this absurdly protectionist restriction in place, it&#x27;s even harder to empathize with their protest. Actually getting violent is even worse.<p>Of course, it&#x27;s also important to remember that this is likely an extreme action by a single individual and does not represent taxi drivers as a group. In fact, there is no immediate link between the attack and taxis, although it seems extremely likely. That said, even ignoring the violence, I do not really sympathize with the taxi protests here.<p>[1]: <a href""http://techcrunch.com/2013/12/28/uber-lecab-and-others-now-have-to-wait-15-minutes-before-picking-you-up-in-france"" rel""nofollo"">http://techcrunch.com/2013/12/28/uber-lecab-and-others-now-h...</a>",1389605939

7049644,comment,7048804,7049508,2,0,jackgavigan,,,"About ten years ago, I had a minor epiphany while working on a system that used a standard client/service architecture. We were having &quot;stability issues&quot; with the back-end (trans: it was going down more often than a two dollar hooker). If the back-end service didn&#x27;t responding, the GUI just hung; there was no indication for the end user that there was a problem - it just hung until it timed out (and because of the nature of the system, the timeout was relatively lengthy).<p>This caused a certain amount of consternation amongst our users (because they were losing money as a result), who would far prefer to be told that the system wasn&#x27;t working than to have to wait for a timeout. So I got the GUI developers to add in a little bit of logic along the lines of:<p><pre><code>  if the response received from the back-end service starts with the string &quot;ERROR_MESSAGE&quot;\n  then parse and display the ensuing text to the user\n  else continue as normal\n</code></pre>\nWe then knocked up a simple little service (using netcat, if I recall correctly) that squirted the contents of a text file back in response to any request, and echo >>&#x27;d the username supplied with the request into a text file. From then on, if the back-end service had a problem, we would redirect the load balancers to point to the mini-service so that any users would get a nice friendly error message (that we could edit/update) telling them that there was a problem.<p>When the outage was over and we&#x27;d confirmed everything was working properly again, we&#x27;d would simply re-point the load-balancers back to the actual service IPs/ports, grab the file with all the usernames and email/call them to let them know that the service was back up. (We had planned to build more logic into the GUI and add an &quot;Alert me when the system is back up&quot; button to the error dialog, which would cause the GUI to automatically/silently re-try every X minutes and alert the user with a pop-up when full seervice was restored but we sorted out the stability problems before we got a chance to implement that).<p>Maybe Dropbox should implement something similar so that, instead of being stuck at &quot;connecting&quot;, users get an error message.",1389605790

Why would you expect that? A PhD is not a meal-ticket. It&#x27;s just an endorsement that says you are very good at undertaking novel and independent research. There is no promise made any point that an academic position or related industry position will be waiting for you at the end. As you say, it&#x27;s just an apprenticeship. Nothing more. It&#x27;s up to you to figure out what, if anything, you will do with that education once you receive it.",1389604033

In this way you have a graceful fallback in case of async server downtime, so your user doesn&#x27;t even notice something went wrong. You are not mixing things which were not developed to be mixed. In this case you are just writing your site as usual and then add real-time elements where necessary.<p>Using Gevent together with Django seems like monkey patching entire web site to me.<p>I really respect the work of guys developing uWSGI. But at moment it does not seem to be usable in a simple obvious way. Maybe in future their real-time support will become mature and convenient enough.<p>Of course, Meteor and Derby like approach is another level of problem solution. But in context of Django I don&#x27;t think we should consider them as examples.

The truth is that many excellent projects have chosen to either stick to not go the v3 route intentionally (because of the extra restrictions), and if they do, several of them choose to dual license under both versions. I can think of numerous projects that are under LGPL v2 (like ffmpeg, GEOS, mapnik, custom webkit) which would cause an amazing suite of iOS applications to surface, but with the current situation, they cannot.

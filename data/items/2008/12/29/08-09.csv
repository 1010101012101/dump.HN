412817,comment,412539,412765,0,0,syntaxfree,,,"""Anticresis""is both the legal and the folk term for these things. I didn't just make that name up. I really mean ""folk""-- people with semi-functional knowledge of essential finance. As for ""services flow"", that's straight out of microeconomics 101. Otherwise, I'm usually too preoccupied about avoiding repetition, so I keep trying to find synonyms. I don't believe I'm coming up with any pseudo-fancy neologism, but if I did, that's just because of my deficient english. Me try to write good but sometimes me makes mistakes.<p>Shared equity mortgage is somewhat similar to anticresis, only entirely different. No equity or property rights are transferred in anticresis, on one hand, and on the other habitation rights are kept until the loan is repaid, so it's more like collateralized debt, other than the collateral is ex ante ""transferred"" (but not really).",1230541086

And Mark Cuban likes to make extravagant purchases (e.g. The Dallas Mavericks). In a nutshell - he seems to enjoy the billionaire's lifestyle.

412785,story,,,233,101,jmtame,"Wow, check out this guy's comment",,"I wrote a short blog about Mark Cuban and his journey to becoming a billionaire.  Not surprisingly, he was motivated by money.  I always have disliked money as a source of motivation, I still do.  Tonight at dinner I was caught off guard when my brother and both parents said ""well of course everyone is driven by money... you mean you thought they were driven by something else?""  Regardless, a guy came to my blog and posted a comment that I found inspirational:<p>---<p>This is the first time I have read a blog and of course the first post of any kind. As a 36 year old plumber I have been fired from every plumbing company I have ever worked for. All of them fired me after about a year. The reasons have all been the same, they asked my opinion about their problems and I told them the truth. It seems every company always has some sort of problems they deal with but never know the answers. The last job I had was running a new hospital project and after 9 months I was asked by management to get rid of half the plumbers and replace them with non-plumbers to drive down cost.<p>The short story is I said no way, it’s illegal and I want no part of it. I then said if they go over my head I will turn them in to the state dept. of health. Well, I was fired….With the economy the way it is no jobs are available. So with a family of 4 and a new house and $300 in checking I started my own plumbing company. Anyone who cares to listen here is what I have to say. Weeks went by with no customers calling and I didn’t know what to do.<p>We were out of money and my wife gave me a choice of getting a wal-mart type job or get out. That night I freaked out and was up all hours of the night just thinking and thinking. Then it came to me. My problem was simple, I was going about this backwards. Money is a stupid motivator, customers are the real motivator. So here is what I did. I went to a printer and had them print up a 1000 $50.00 gift cards on heavy paper stock all of them with code numbers. The next thing I did was go door to door and meet people one at a time. Ya, it was crazy at first but the people were blown away, they loved it. As of right now I am the number one plumber in a town of about 40,000 people and am looking to hire another plumber.<p>So whats the secret? Give people what they want. All these years I was right, most people let money motivate them and that creates poor decision making. I let the customer decide. The economy is tough so just give the customers what they want, money. People were so blown away they thought it was a joke. Think about it for a moment, have you ever heard of a business come to your door, shake your hand, and while looking in there eyes tell them you would like to earn the business and by they way here is a fifty dollar gift card that can be used anytime for any plumbing service they need.<p>When it’s all said and done I wished I would have done this years ago. I enjoyed the article about Mark Cuban but I think money is just a poor motivator, money is the result of good business practice. My wife by the way thought it was crazy to give $50 to everyone I meet, she was wrong, but now she is my biggest fan. That $50 is nothing when you consider a customer spends thousands during the course of a life time, not to mention they spread word of mouth business like fire. Mike",1230538786

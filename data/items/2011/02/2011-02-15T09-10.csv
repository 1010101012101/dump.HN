It's hard to hold banks or merchants responsible for fraud.

2220657,comment,2220133,2220515,0,0,zeemonkee,,,"With Django - or any ORM it's a good idea to keep an eye on the SQL that your application is running. Use the django debug toolbar[1] and run your SQL queries against a profiler. Most of the time, that's where your serious bottlenecks will be. If a query happens to be a bottleneck, there are ways the ORM can improve performance (e.g. select_related() to reduce the number of queries in a loop, only() and defer() to reduce the number of columns in a query, and so on[2]. In some cases this may even involve using pure SQL or caching heavily used queries.<p>Look at using processes vs threads with mod_wsgi, which should help improve performance. Ultimately however you might find nginx a better option, particularly if you are using it for static media/load balancing anyway. I'd suggest uwsgi (also heard good things about gunicorn). Use supervisord or another process monitor to make sure the lights stay on.<p>[1] <a href=""https://github.com/robhudson/django-debug-toolbar"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/robhudson/django-debug-toolbar</a>

For every word of length N, you've got to store 1 + 2 + ... + N-1 + N characters, which is O(N^2).  The constant is 1/2, and you do get some savings in shared prefixes, so that's definitely a worst-case upper bound -- but a trie grows with O(N).<p>The O(log(N)) lookup time can also be a limiting factor with large sets.  A trie is going to give you worst-case linear lookup time in the length of the longest string in your set.  This can be a pretty dramatic difference as string sets get large.",1297760851

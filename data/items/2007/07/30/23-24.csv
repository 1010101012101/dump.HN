You'll have to check this for yourself (google for opinions, etc.).<p>Slicehost and other similar services (VPS') are about as cheap as it can get but bear in mind that you're sharing hardware with other people so don't assume you'll be the only one using the server.<p>If you want real hardware, google for ""managed hosting"". Alternatively, if you already have a 1u server lying around or can get hold to one (or more) it may be cheaper to search for ""colocation services"" which should show you some companies that will provide rackspace for your servers.<p>Renting hardware may be cheaper but if you buy a couple of servers on ebay and go for colocation, in the event of your business going belly up you can sell the hardware and maybe get enough money to last you for a couple of months while you search for a job or make new plans for world domination.",1185839735

I was a member of the community that would eventually be using the software, and I basically just built something I would use myself ...""</i><p>Do you think this is a variation of <i>""make what users want""</i>? <p>Initially being in a community gives you insight into what they want. But you don't always have to be part of a community to do this. You could just as easily extend this to <i>""making tools for yourself""</i> solving those annoying problems. In the process develop something that others <i>might</i> find useful.<p><i>""... ""Operacy"" and the skills of doing. The notion that it is enough to ""know"" is both absurd and dangerous.

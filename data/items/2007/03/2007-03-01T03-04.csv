I'm pretty sure the site, layout & idea have been inspired by the defection from lisp to python ~ http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/rewritingreddit<p>As the site progresses it proves a point. That ""Reddit"" could have continued in Lisp had they persisted and that ""Lisp -like languages"", can still cut it.

If you read it in conjunction with ""succinctness is power"" ~ http://www.paulgraham.com/power.html you can get another view on what parts of languages are useful & why. <p> '... working on Arc with Paul and if any of his ideas are making it in there ...'<p>Dont know.  They both appear to be pretty busy on their own stuff.<p>Matt you made the comment on reddit, 'Arc ""compiles"" into Scheme' didn't you? ~ http://reddit.com/info/15gkq/comments/c15iof<p>",1172719836

1640,comment,1588,1588,0,0,veritas,,,"Yahoo has bigger problems than the lack of innovation.  It's insanely bloated as a company now.  Why Yahoo Photos and Flickr?  Why My Yahoo and My Web and Delicious?  Why can't I log in to Delicious with my Yahoo login?  Why is their web page so cluttered?  They really need to cut it down.  Dump Yahoo Photos, dump My Web and Yahoo 360.  Streamline into 5 areas:  Media (News, TV, Commercial Video), Search (Panama), Social Media (Flickr, Delicious, My Yahoo, Music), Email (most critical) and Hosting (I'd drop hosting too but I don't have an MBA and 5 is a much nicer number than 4).  Thats my opinion, but I don't have an MBA... just some common sense.

This means that half of the criteria do not even pertain our needs/interests as founders of entrepreneurial ventures.  (tech populations / graduation rates may apply but those should be looked at separately.<p>Let me pose this question.  If VC/angel fudning / programmers needs /  location was not an issue, where would you start your company?<p>There are a lot of places in this country that in my opinion would gather much more interest on a local level that starting a company in NY or SF.  I think by starting a web company in an already ""hot"" web area is like opening a starbucks across the street from a starbucks? Sure you know it will get business, but it would be better if it was the 1st starbucks on a major University Campus. <p>By launching in a less saturated market, you have the benefit of traditional sources of media attention so that you receive high adoption rates locally, which as we know is vital to high adoption rates globally.  Does company location have anything to do with adoption rates?<p>Thoughts?

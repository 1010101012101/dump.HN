(a unignorable aspect of this, of course, is financial well-being, which is why many of us are here on news.YC)<p>If you're not doing what makes you happy, and have no plans nor desire to get out of this vicious cycle (I know, I've been there), then you will just keep spreading unhappiness to those you touch around you.

If you're going to slam Python for 'dumbing things down' to appeal to a 'mainstream programmer crowd' you can probably find better ammunition.  ",1190410978

It is 2 years old, and Guido has said he will not be dropping functional constructs in Python.<p>And the reason he wanted to remove them is not because he wants to 'dumb down' the language, but rather because list comprehensions do what filter/map/reduce can do 9 times out of 10 but end up a lot more legible. He says as much in that post. But again, if you really want those functions, they still exist in Python and will exist in the future.\n",1190410488

Her ethics is usually called ""enlightened self-interest"" or ""rational egoism.""<p>There are now quite a number of Ayn Rand philosophy chairs at various high profile universites in the country.<p>It's funny, but one of the reasons Rand is coming into universities these days is the attitude that no theory is any better than any other i.e, subjectivism. The very thing that Rand spent so much time attacking!\n(I got this from talking to the guys who run the Ayn Rand Institute, which is largley responsible for these developments.)<p>Edit: Regarding Nietzsche, you are 100% corrent. For what it's worth Rand was adamant that her ethics was nothing like Nietzsche. Here's the most positive thing she had to say about him: ""as a poet, he projects at times (not consistently)a magnificent feeling for man's greatness, expressed in emotional, not intellectual terms.""",1190409669

58118,comment,57915,58045,0,0,jsjenkins168,,,"With an SLA suspension, you could just increase the ratio of bottom arm length relative to top arm to get a faster camber curve. But judging by the pic they plan on using this in McPherson style setups. Even if they left the camber settings the same though, the tire contact should still be better with the reduced roll. Increased roll angle will cause more positive camber than the camber curve will decrease it due to suspension compression. This is the reason why you typically go with more negative camber when you soften a suspension setup.<p>A setup like this would not work well for a few other reasons too. Like on a sports car, it would have problems with heat I can guarantee it. Looking at the pic it already has heat sinks all over the place, but in a race situation the heat emission would be totally ridiculous. As far as handling goes, it could have problems with grip when cornering hard over bumps. The outside wheel would essentially behave like having a damper with very high bump stiffness. I know they claim it has fast response time, but it would need to have very high resolution to still absorb bumps when it is basically holding up that corner of the car.

58115,comment,58025,58063,0,0,DanielBMarkham,,,"I'll elaborate: in systems design you start with nothing. With words, ideas, feelings. Heck -- most of the time people can't even express what they want the system to do! When you start like that, you are in a completely impracticable spot.<p><p>Not only that, but when you do get the words out, they're all just abstractions of other things. ""We'd like the user to see the most relevant article"" Well gee, what do you mean by ""relevant""? What do you mean by ""see""? It's the same exact problem you face when you're talking about stuff most people consider BS, like are we real or not. <p>\nSo you start in this totally meaningless set of concepts, you refine, you abstract, you categorize -- in short, you take a trip through each of the major branches of philosophy. When they say ""user"", do they mean something that is part of an abstract type of ""person""? Or is that over-designing? When we look at scaling past ten million users, what's the impact of applying various principles of set theory, such as normalization? When we say we want the machine to learn what the user wants, do we really mean just what his next actions will be?<p>\nWe do all of this automatically, without realizing that some pretty smart other people have walked many of these roads before. Because those guys have been there, done that, all of these sciences have been created: sciences like hardware and software design, debugging, complexity theory. For the most part, we don't need to learn about all of these smart people and the full stories of their ideas. After all, only about 1 or 2 percent of what they did lived on after them. But by understanding a more complete version of what they thought, sometimes it can save you going down a dead end. And heck, it can just make discovering the answer more fun. And at the end, when all of that BS comes toghether for a real, live, working system? It's a thing of beauty. Did you even build a system for a large organizatino and every department had a different idea of what reality was? Did you look for wrong and right people, or think of the word ""paradigm"" (Kuhn -- sort of)<p>\nYou can't take philosophy like you would a hard science. It doesn't progress or evolve from one phase to another, and half of it doesn't even make sense with the other half. That's okay, though. It doesn't mean that it is not useful, just different.",1190409511

How does the meaning change when you put ""self interested"" together as a phrase?<p>As Paul mentioned in his essay, you're already bumping into what words mean.<p>I can tell you what an integer is, what a square root is, and what a ratio is, and as a result, I can (by looking it up in a book and typing in the text, heh heh) prove that the square root of 2 can't be expressed as the ratio of two integers.

58107,comment,58025,58057,0,0,neilc,,,"IMHO Rand is vastly different from Nietzsche. There is obviously some degree of influence, but Nietzsche is subjective, anti-systematic and anti-rational, while Rand is almost the canonical example of a philosophy that attempts to be objective, systematic and rational.<p>As for Rand's limited influence on subsequent development in philosophy, that's an interesting point. Why is this the case? Even if you disagree with Rand's philosophy, I think it's pretty outrageous that her work isn't even mentioned in more university philosophy programs. There are only a few other philosophers whose work provides as complete a system for understanding reality, the nature of knowledge, and the nature of ethics (I'd include Aristotle, Plato, and Hegel as others that are similarly complete, but there aren't too many after that).<p>So why is Rand's work not taught more often? I'd say that is mostly the result of the biases and predilections of the typical university philosophy department.",1190408535

Joel's point, as I took it, is that people too committed to rolling their own everything out of misplaced focus on performance _now_ are going to miss out on the performance and interoperability improvements that will be coming in the future.<p>Here's an example from Mac software history that Joel may be ignorant of: WriteNow, a word processor, was well known for being blazingly fast. It was the only application in its class written in hand-tuned 68K assembly. Everyone bowed before the WriteNow team's accomplishments...until the PowerPC Macs came along and made their codebase obsolete.

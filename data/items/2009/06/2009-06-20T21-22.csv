There are some technological tricks that have recently made it <i>much</i> easier, though.<p>In addition to Arxiv and preprints I can find online, there's Google Scholar and Amazon Previews (I'm still missing many journal articles, especially in engineering, due to a lack of university access, luckily they're often compiled in journals on Amazon). By flipping through Amazon's book previews using the search feature, I can read an arbitrary number of pages in any given book, and the world's library is at my lap. I can then 'photocopy' the relevant/interesting sections using ctrl-shift-command-4 on my Mac, and paste them into my Evernote. In this way I can locate and collate a large number of papers and texts, and organize them along the way without even dipping into LaTeX. After that, I can past those copies into Mathematica, which has a very workable equation typesetter, with the additional advantage of the equations being computable.<p>Lately I make a lot of use of Evernote, however, which I can pretty much paste anything into, and I can 'photocopy' any part of a text on the computer by using ctrl-shift-command-4 on my Mac.",1245535159

666862,comment,665755,666715,0,0,snprbob86,,,"I appreciate your views as they are far more balanced than the average lock-in conspiracy theorist. You seem to have thought this out thoroughly and I respect that.<p>I'm telling you now that lock-in has never been an explicit goal of any team I have worked for or with. Lock-in is often an unfortunate side effect of prioritizing customer paint points and integration, while downplaying the importance of engineering.<p>""What is my escape plan?"" is a very real question that enterprise buyers consider. Microsoft software does, in fact, offer escape plans. You just need to think at the enterprise level instead of at the consumer level. Consider our server technology: someone builds an intranet app for their enterprise which uses .NET, IIS, Windows Server, etc. Their app is now tightly bound to a Microsoft stack. Each of these individual components has evolved together due to business needs and it is quite difficult for open source software to replicate any piece of the stack. That is more an accident of process than anything else.<p>Now lets say Microsoft server licenses are too expensive and your enterprise decides to move to Linux. The Microsoft licensing costs are already sunk. The enterprise doesn't say ""Oh dammit. We've got to get rid of all these old Microsoft servers and move everything to Linux!"" Why would they do that? If it isn't broken, don't fix it. Instead, they keep on running the old servers and put up with the old problems because they have already paid for that stuff. It's in the past. Enterprise customers don't buy individual components. They buy ""solutions"". Sure, if you get a Microsoft server stack, you're locked into the Microsoft server solution. But you wouldn't ever change any one piece of that stack anyway even if you could. Enterprises simply don't operate that way.<p>Now, in the document space, you want your old data to keep on trucking if you decide to switch to OpenOffice or something. Customers want that escape plan and if they don't get it, they won't buy. So Microsoft spends the money on developing that escape plan. Engineering decides that the existing standards aren't sufficient (it's true, the open spreadsheet standards still are not finalized for cell functions!), so they go build their own, but apply for standardization so that others can replicate the standard. They documented that spec in incredible detail because there was A LOT of skeptics. They had to silent the skeptics to convince governments to buy Office.<p>Lock-in hurts Microsoft too. Our customers expect escape plans, but we're not going to spend dollars developing escape plans that customers haven't asked for. That's just bad business.",1245534528

666853,comment,666407,666798,0,0,aheilbut,,,"Well, I think such a book would be useful, and strikes me as a pretty obvious idea, with plenty of analogies in related areas (ie. zoomable user interfaces; code folding).<p>Currently, if you are reading math and hit something you don't understand, you can refer to other references (which may not use the same notation or approach things in quite the same way), and/or try to work out the details yourself, or get help from someone else.  Working through yourself and looking at other sources certainly helps one learn, but can be very inefficient, and there can be a high energy barrier to success.<p>A 'zoomable' math text would require a lot of work to create, but the writing could be done collaboratively (or even partly automatically).  There is some software to be written to implement this idea, but given the large number of computer and other scientists who depend on learning and using math, it is surprising to me that there hasn't been more experimentation with different ways to present it.<p>I guess I should try to write it...",1245534079

666849,comment,665735,666142,0,0,beagle3,,,"It is my opinion that non of the ""memory-to-memory"" tasks is holding any better language back; if anything, it's accessing the real world and/or accessing other systems.<p>The tasks you listed are usually available with a new language as part of its standard library, albeit not feature complete or with a standard interface. An implementation such as you suggested may provide a feature complete, standardised solution -- however, it will not be convenient due to ""impedance mismatch"" (differing object models / storage models / needed conversions back and from, etc).<p>Validating an email address is all good, but without shelling out to /usr/bin/mail or tcp access, you can't actually send it -- and whatever you use for actually sending it probably has a validator already.<p>Parsing, specifically (most of your examples) has relatively good language agnostic support in such things as the GOLD parser --- and yet, it always loses in convenience to a system that lets you embed implementation language constructs, such as yacc / lex / ometa / antlr / lemon and friends.<p>Sorry for being a little non constructive, but I think that without a concrete, specific use case that clearly demonstrates an advantage, this project may be interesting philosophically, but useless in practice. When you work out an example compare: (cost of implementing said feature from scratch in a new language) to (cost of implementing interpreter + conversions from language + conversion of results back to language idioms + ... + in each language + 1/6 feature (amortized over 6 languages)). Take into account unicode and charset handling because you value correctness above all. I think you'll find it hard to justify.<p>What are those languages somewhat devoid of libraries, and what is the large body of methods that can actually fit in this list of yours that you believe are holding language adoption back? I surely lack breadth of knowledge and imagination, but I can't come up with these lists.",1245533671

Related, Xah Lee's crazy writings inspired me to take my social life seriously and not over-share on the internet. Both of them, and the rest of the comp.lang.lisp, taught me that getting stuff done was more important than making sure I was using the most aesthetically pure computing environment. Another lisp programmer, Philip Greenspun, also demonstrated  the negative effects of too much writing online. In addition, he showed me that photography was mostly a factor of how much film and equipment one can afford, which inspired me to give that up and focus more on music and other things I had natural talent for.  Finally, and only related in form, reading Ludwig Wittgenstein's later ""notebook"" style writings inspired me to give up on philosophy and enter industry instead of philosophy grad school.",1245532768

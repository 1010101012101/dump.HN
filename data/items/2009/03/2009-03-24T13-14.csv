530111,comment,529822,530038,0,0,1gor,,,"Microsoft has not became dominant because they got a freebee or two from BSD. This is exactly the point - try imagine some evil company today grabbing Apache code-base and starting a commercial branch of it. So what? They will fail against Apache proper, as ESR points out.<p>Let me try to argue not from ideological (closed source being immoral etc.) but from the economic point of view. We are talking about commoditization of software here.<p>There are two types of software - one that contains competitive advantage for the business, and one that is a commodity. And software has a tendency to migrate from the first bucket to the second very fast. And by the way, 'commodity' is not a bad word. Software may be very smart and complicated, but it would not be unique in what it does.<p>For example, if you have written the first social network software -- you have something unique and you'd be mad to open source it straight away (or you'd be very passionate about software freedom, like RMS :)   . But when there appear tens of social network apps floating around, you should act like ning and give away your software for free. Why?<p>This seems to be the rational choice for commodity software. To become king of commodities you have to compete on price. 'Free' is the ultimate winner price. And MIT license is the ultimate free license (less restrictions than GPL).<p>When your free application grabs large enough slice of market share (mind share) it will start paying for itself in many ways. It 'develops and tests itself', it provides free marketing for you etc. And you are free to build another unique value-adding application on top of this commodity layer.<p>So, for example, 37signals are very happy with RoR being free and under MIT license. They are using it for their in-house proprietary webapps, while it is being developed and tested now to the large extend by the community. I am sure 37signals would be ecstatic if Microsoft decided to 'grab' Ruby on Rails and integrate it into their next OS.",1237903191

530107,comment,529124,529816,0,0,katz,,,"> you don't have to be ""smart"", you have to fit in. economics is a self-referential discipline. there is no real standard of truth or verity or validity of a theory and hence a lot of bickering even about fundamental questions.<p>The closer a theory fit to practice (e.g. economic modelling) the better it is.<p>> those who arguably understand economics very well (say a soros)<p>There is a difference between understanding macro economics and a person doing dubious and unethical things to get money (e.g. Soros). Soros was involved in many dubious financial transactions and was found guilty of insider trading in France. What he did in Hong Kong may not be entirely illegal but it certainly is completely unethical.<p>Also - their is a difference between macro-economics and things such as stock trading or currency speculation.<p>On the other hand - most people have a problem with a lot of economists because of what their results are (i.e. not progressive).",1237903084
530106,comment,529822,530071,0,0,neilk,,,"That's a good point, but I think RMS' insight was that software exists in an ecosystem. No program is an island.<p>Let's say I develop a very useful system under a free software model. Work that undercuts the monopoly of the unfree software producers, who fight you tooth and nail for years. They lose, but then they do the standard countermove -- taking the work and doing an Embrace & Extend. They provide a system which is <i>subtly incompatible</i> to all their users, which aims to capture all the benefits of your new idea while wresting control of its future development.<p>This is the situation that RMS was fighting in the 80s and 90s. It wasn't just Microsoft; most users of any computing platform were in thrall to one dominant company or the other, be it Sun or IBM or what have you, who pulled similar tricks.<p>Linus Torvalds has said over and over that GPLing Linux was the smartest move he ever made. It created a situation where rival companies could trust each other, since each contribution would always go towards growing the Linux ecosystem for everyone. No one company would ever capture all the benefits for themselves. This has worked so well that Linus continues to use GPL for his newer projects like git.<p>Personally, I trust Linus more than ESR when it comes to understanding software. Linus is a true pragmatist with real experience running major software projects that are disruptive to the existing order.<p>ESR portrays himself as both a great programmer and a pragmatist, but the evidence is largely confined to his own writings. I leave it up to others to decide if fetchmail is on the same level as git or emacs. And if you look at his other writings, he's explicitly political. He is the sort of libertarian who is actively against the idea that freedom should come with responsibilities to other citizens. (As the featured speaker at a gathering of Computer Professionals for Social Responsibility, he ridiculed their name.) I say this not to imply he has some evil agenda - he's trying to describe the world how he sees it, and he regards appeals to ""responsibility"" as an Atlas-Shruggy tyranny of the mediocre. However, much like Ayn Rand, he overstates the case when he alludes to his own work as being definitive, or even academically significant. I don't know of any empirical studies that back up his political ideas, and in this excerpt at least he is not citing any.",1237903022

Often times, teachers and students are not even consulted on what is purchased and implemented.<p>I also really like the idea of getting a belt in martial arts. Passing grades has become so expected and boring that there really isn't a differentiation there or a marker that the student has actually achieved something. If you were creating different paths for students to take, how would you organize the content/courses? Would you stay with the curriculum process that is taught in K-12 schools and just allow students to go at their own pace? or would you change it? If you'd change it, what would you use to determine the curriculum path?<p>Your point about integrating education with real things is perfect. Something we've been thinking about is creating a type of student corp or tutor corp that would match up smart students with struggling students. Peer 2 Peer learning is going to be huge b/c it is really the only thing that scales. (As David Wiley has said, we have limited ""teacher bandwidth"" so we need to get creative, particularly when you look at things in the context of the entire world. There is just simply not enough educators out there and we are not exactly efficient at turning them out.) So, the question becomes: How do you create an ethos in which students want to help other students? Do you think an open platform that allows this would be sufficient? or, do you think you'd need to be deliberate about creating this culture? If the latter, then how would you go about conscientiously creating this type of atmosphere? One thought is to incentivise it so that students and teachers are rewarded for reaching out. This could come in the form of Karma points, recommendations, a moving up (to stay with your metaphor: yellow belt--> green belt etc.). What else would you recommend?",1237901111

You've described it exactly in your description. The technical term for that is self-efficacy. The idea is that it is challenging enough, but not too challenging. Another field that nails this, and is consequently very addictive, is video games. We love to feel like we can master something and learning is no different.<p>Would you consider working with us in approaching Exeter? I've found that having a connection always helps.<p>Regarding the approach you've described, I think that works particularly well for math problems/courses. Did Exeter do anything innovative with content related courses (biology, psychology, literature) that stood out to you?",1237900426

I personally believe the experience is far superior, and the lessons learnt more valuable. Depending on how you travel of course.<p>So imho if you're basing uni's value purely on the social aspect then it comes up way short. Instead, go travel for a year or three, figure out who you are and what you're passionate about, then get to it. You're forced to be social in both atmosphere's.<p>Compare a four year degree to two years of travel and two years work experience in your chosen field. Which do you think has the edge?",1237899938

The open source development model is so superior that said company will be left in the dust with their handful of code, while the open project will maintain dominance.<p>So why scare anyone away with restrictive licenses when open source will naturally prevail anyway.<p>But what about the advantage Microsoft gained from basically grabbing a BSD-licensed TCP stack for WinNT?  Apparently they recoded most of that stuff since then, but it was probably a great help at the time.  All you need to defeat esr's argument is one or two cases where it was proven wrong.<p>In my opinion, the GPL is not just a legal document but a cultural artifact.  When you see a GPL notice, you can feel warm fuzzy feelings of sharing certain beliefs with the authors about freedom and sharing.  You can feel the peace that comes with source code.<p>To paraphrase you, why should I invest my own free time in a project that could be subverted from bringing freedom to its users?<p>Market- and mind-share are not everyone's measure of success.  And I'm not prepared to have you redefine software freedom in the name of RMS today, alright?  :)",1237899606

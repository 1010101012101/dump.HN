I am about four years into my career and have recently begun realizing that I will not surpass what I consider mediocrity without taking steps beyond my 9-5 job. Now that I have begun looking seriously at my path, it is amazing to look back at the fears that have been holding me back. I have been afraid to start my own side projects, out of fear that I won't be able to contend with what other people can do. I had to have the very obvious realization that I will never get better if I don't try, and that everyone has to start exactly where they are. Since then it is like a light has gone off, and I have become much more appreciative of those who try, rather than hold back and criticize. Thanks for posting this.",1271732341

They determine that this compound binds to fascin, which has some molecular biological background as something that bundles actin, and some population biological background as something that corresponds with worse survival in breast cancer. They then develop the crystal structure for fascin both with and without their new molecule, and they show that their macroketone binds to the actin binding sites on fascin. They also use electron microscopy to determine that their new molecule indeed appears to disrupt actin bundling by fascin.<p>They then gave to immune-deficient mice human breast cancer cells. These cells typically metastasize aggressively. They gave the mice a 'placebo' and/or shRNA against fascin and/or their new macroketone. The shRNA and their macroketone successfully cut the metastatic burden by ~50-80%. (shRNA ultimately leads to downregulation of the mRNA of target proteins, so their shRNA should reduce fascin synthesis while their macroketone reduces the function of already-made fascin.)<p>It's not a silver bullet against metastatic breast cancer, but it's an impressively complete story for one paper.

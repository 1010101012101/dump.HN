6551012,comment,6550068,6550068,3,0,pippy,,,"It would be interesting to see how the Chinese envision an international currency. Essentially fiat currencies regard tax payers as asset-backed securities, and create value by issuing government backed bonds. With no tax payers and no central body (or a joint venture with unconstructive bickering) you&#x27;d run into some fundamental issues. You could: 1) peg existing currencies to it (good luck getting buy in)<p>2) peg the currency to physical goods (gold, oil, etc). Fiat currencies have distinct advantages which make it optimal for modern trade.<p>3) use treaties to regulate government sovereign bonds with the global currency",1381802395

Don&#x27;t get me wrong, I totally understand the fun of reading/writing completely inappropriate ranting (well sometimes -- I&#x27;m a bit uncomfortable with &quot;The other person&#x27;s religion, politics, body attributes, whatever. It&#x27;s all in good fun.&quot;).<p>On the other hand, being more inviting has advantages both selfish (more women around, good for both social reasons and for their talent) and moral (giving opportunity to women, and anyone who isn&#x27;t into caustic banter, for that matter).  If you love programming, imagine being deprived of it because you felt unwelcome in programming circles.  I think it&#x27;s kind of wrong for those of us in places of leadership to deny opportunity to people for the benefit of our fun.",1381802359

Finally, if a government enacts and enforces laws and decrees contrary to the constitution and human rights in general (i.e., it is no longer a constitutional state), introduction of political gives government forces both an excuse and the means to start acting fully extra-judicially.<p>I&#x27;ll note that I&#x27;m saying this as a individual with classical liberal/libertarian political leanings and as a strong supporter of a right to bear arms.

6550986,comment,6550068,6550893,2,0,ekianjo,,,"Gold has physical value, yes, because it is relatively rare on Earth and has interesting chemical and physical properties that can be used in several ways. And on top of that, it&#x27;s dense, can be melted, and does not corrode over time. Therefore making is a good tool to represent &quot;money&quot;.<p>> why do you think bullion currencies are more common during times of warfare?\nBecause inflation runs crazy during warfare and therefore people trying to save their earnings go for gold, silver and others in order to avoid losing the face value of their fiat currencies. And by the way, the Gold standard was abandoned in History mainly to fund the war in Europe during the 1st world war, and then later in the 20th century because of the expenses of the US military policy during the Cold war.<p>> when are countries incentivized to &quot;expand their credit line to the infinite&quot;?\nLook at the current situation in the US. Everyone knows they will never pay their debt, yet it keeps growing. You can expect things to crash hard down the road.<p>> would you rather have a currency that can modify its inflation/deflation rate based on any number of relevant factors, or a currency whose inflation/deflation rate is tied to the rate of mining of some rocks in the ground?<p>The later, obviously, because Gold is neutral and does not belong to any government. The US Dollar, the Euro and other fiat currencies are all controlled by different central banks with different agendas. I have no control over what they can do in the future. But Gold is tangible, and there&#x27;s not much Gold being extracted nowadays to change the face value of it.<p>Why do you think China is building a huge Gold reserve currently, and buying Gold as much as they can from all over the world?

However, it would mean lots of people who bought high in the current market would lose their shirts if such a thing were to happen.<p>I remember the very first time I visited SF, my friend was regaling us with tales of the insane housing prices. No slouch and from a pretty expensive area myself I figured it was just an issue of demand like you&#x27;d see in any other big city. But when I actually got to the city I was floored with how low the density obviously was. The solution to the high housing prices seemed idiotically simple then as it does now. Build SF up up up! Areas around every major BART station should also be higher density areas. Relax the density further out from these centers and you&#x27;d end up with a much more livable city plan like pretty much every single other city in the country.<p>By way of comparison, the D.C. metro area (not exactly a well planned urban paradise) has about the same population density as SF Bay Area yet housing can be had for probably around 2/3s the price at comparable distances from the city center.",1381800894

I would be fine signing such a contract in the U.S. too, if a company wanted to ensure a more stable employment relationship. But that condition isn&#x27;t common.<p>If the employer doesn&#x27;t offer you a contract with terms about mutual notice periods, I don&#x27;t think it would be prudent to unilaterally extend a lengthy notice period with no assurances from the other side. As the article admits, if you give six weeks&#x27; notice and the boss reacts angrily, he/she can turn around and fire you instantly with no notice, since the company never committed to any notice period. It&#x27;s a completely asymmetric situation there. Giving notice closer to when you plan to leave the job (say, the traditional two weeks) reduces your downside exposure to loss of income.<p>I do think it would be nice, for both sides, if mutual notice periods of at least a few weeks became more common terms in employment contracts.

You can modify any part of the environment at runtime—in fact there is really no distinction between run-time and compile-time.<p>IMO the biggest flaw in Ruby is that it doesn&#x27;t really take advantage of this design choice. Of course there is a performance cost to this kind of dynamism, and all it really buys you in Ruby is the ability to monkey-patch other people&#x27;s code (the advisability of which is debated). In the Lisp world you have tools like SLIME which provide a much shorter feedback loop to the developer by connecting the dynamic runtime to the editing environment.<p>Tools like pry move Ruby forward in this area but it is still nothing like SLIME. My impression is that the weakness of Ruby&#x27;s module system, along with heavy use of OO classes, make it unlikely for Ruby to ever support that kind of development process.<p>(There are other examples of Ruby&#x27;s Lisp heritage, such as everything-is-an-expression and implicit return values, but I think those are relatively small design choices compared to the runtime thing.)",1381800396

It&#x27;s a very limited (powerful in one way, but limited in many others) way to approach the problem of &quot;to what extent do mutations in DNA cause phenotype changes&quot;.  It requires fairly large sample sizes to do reliably for diseases which don&#x27;t have a really strong (mendelian or otherwise) signal, it&#x27;s fairly poor at working with pairs or larger # of interactions between genes, can&#x27;t do much with genes and the environment, and is a really simiplified model of how organismal biology works, anyway.<p>there are a few issues with exome:\n1) exome prep is a big issue in itself\n2) exome leaves out large regions which are likely to be important in understanding many aspects of human biology<p>At this point, I&#x27;m speculating:<p>even whole genome sequence at relatively high coverage per individual * large # of individuals is likely to not explain all the aspects of organismal biology.  There appears to be a fair amount of state that is transferred from a parent cell to a child cell during mitosis that is not expressed in our current DNA assemblies.  The whole chromosomes themselves are complex, enormous structures that undergo massive rearrangements during the various phases of the cell cycle... yet are still capable of maintaining tons of epigenetic state.  Very little or none of this is really being analyzed in a systematic or rigorous way, which is frustrating to see because, as somebody with a training in human molecular biology, all of this has been KNOWN FOR DECADES!

I said people pay the Red Cross to do what it does: but the amount paid in must be at least as large as the amount spent by the Red Cross or they won&#x27;t be able to continue doing what they&#x27;re doing.<p>that&#x27;s still not profit. That&#x27;s breaking even.<p>> Was the local fire department a for-profit corporation?<p>A for-profit corporation. a privatised fire service. Because socialism is evil, supposedly, in this rural town, paying the fire fee is a voluntary choice, not an involuntary tax, and thus the fire service made sure nobody was going to <i>die</i> and then stood by and watched the house burn down. Because the family had opted not to pay the monthly subscription fee.<p>> So you missed the part where I explicitly said that people pay the Red Cross to help other people.<p>when what you wrote is <i>right there</i> and you haven&#x27;t even bothered to edit it to fit this lie, saying something like this is a bit on the absurd side.<p>I&#x27;ll put what you actually wrote, here again, for your own benefit.<p>> In a sane world the Red Cross would be a normal corporation that was selling the service of helping people.<p>and so<p>> You know that it is very dishonest to put words in other people&#x27;s mouths and accuse them of taking positions they have not taken, sir.<p>It&#x27;s dishonest to switch your positions at your convenience and make an accusation like that. It&#x27;s stupid to do this when there&#x27;s a visible record of you having done so.<p>OF COURSE you can say explicitly that you&#x27;ve changed your position, and that you&#x27;ve realised you were mistake in your view of the word  &quot;profit&quot; \nbut somehow I don&#x27;t think this is going to happen.",1381799256

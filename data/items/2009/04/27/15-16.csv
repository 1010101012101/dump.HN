I know quite a bit about PCI, cache coherency and prediction.<p>I'd say whoever wrote the patent covered a good idea. Good enough to be patentable? Hum... It's clever. Not completely obvious. But not earth shattering either...<p>If Apple couldn't find any prior art, meaning the patent authors were truly the first ones to come with this, then I'd have to side with them and say that yes, it's patentable.<p>I'm just surprised because there were millions of academic and research papers on such topics.

I still remember A|W video they've sent us which showcased PowerAnimator 9.5 (Still miss it's OptiFX quality, not the same as in Maya!) and guys from Naughty dog working on something not yet released (Crash Bandicoot). I clearly remember watching that VHS sitting at my workstation (Indigo2 Maximum Impact) and looking at those guys also on Indigo2's (regular graphics, green ones) like they had a fun of their life, while I was preping color corrected shots for an alcohol drink commercial, sigh. There were big wars back then between A|W and softimage, there was even an alliance PR from Psygnosis, Konami and SEGA which stated they will use Softimage only for their games. SEGA later developed Animanium, which is a shame it never reached target audience - it went bust (Animanium, that is).",1240847838

That’s all there is to it. It’s incumbent on every Ruby programmer to either reject this sort of misogynistic sewage, or accept that you’re never going to advance the promotion of Rails in the public perception because members of the community still think it’s edgy or cool to put pictures of strippers in their public presentations.

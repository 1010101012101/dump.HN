398121,comment,397408,397670,0,0,Prrometheus,,,"Gregor Heinrich has a good paper on Latent Dirichlet Allocation, which I believe is an extension of Latent Semantic Analysis. It is a model which can be used to group documents based on semantic content. He gives the mathematical details and the ""punchlines"" for implementation. The model takes as input a collection of documents and outputs a topic label for each word in each document. The documents can be plotted in K-dimensional space, where K is the number of possible topics, by using the proportion of each topic in a document as its coordinates. Documents which are closer to each other have topics more similar to each other. You could then use your favorite clustering algorithm or a simple distance threshold to decide which should documents should link to each other.<p>The paper is here [PDF]: <a href=""http://www.arbylon.net/publications/text-est.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.arbylon.net/publications/text-est.pdf</a><p>C++ implementation: <a href=""http://gibbslda.sourceforge.net/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://gibbslda.sourceforge.net/</a><p>(note, I haven't used the C++ implementation).",1229324019

398116,comment,398075,398075,0,0,jmtame,,,"That follow-up was really weak.  You're basically sitting there yelling at Michael & Gang with your fingers plugging your ears without having anything conclusive or supporting.  You absolutely dismissed every single credible entrepreneur as living a life of satisfaction and laziness, to a degree.  I don't think anyone is arguing the fact that entrepreneurs don't spend every single waking hour in front of a monitor... that's not the issue.  So what the hell are you arguing?  Where's your street cred at if you're going to sit there and call bullshit on everyone?<p>I'm sorry, but you have completely missed the point of that entire video.  If you want work-life balance, you WILL lose.  That's the nature of business and competition.<p>Bring the downvotes on (if this story ever gets bumped up).<p>EDIT: I hated the content of this article, but why did it get deleted??",1229323908

398108,comment,397990,398037,0,0,sachinag,,,"I'll bite - this strikes me as worse than Akamai, because anyone can get on those Akamai servers if you're a customer of theirs.  Only Google will have access to these servers - I'd almost prefer that the Akamai arrangement would be against the rules.<p>I know, I know - this suggestion seems crazy.  But maintaining dumb pipes is critical to maintaining the separation between content and carriage.  We've already seen the cable companies get into fights over bundles of channels - and putting servers inside the networks would essentially turn websites into the new cable channels.",1229322715
398107,comment,397739,398101,0,0,bokonist,,,"What is this mysterious ""will of the people""?  How is it measured except through the politicians the people elect?  If the politician relies on polling to make every decision, is that ""democracy""?  Or should we have direct democracy with each decision being subject to a popular referendum?  Although, even a referendum is not the ""will of the people"" - it's just the will of the majority.  Perhaps then we should demand complete 100% consensus for every decision enacted?<p>As a reader of hacker news, I assume you like to think of yourself as a person of science and reason.  But when you summon phrases such as ""will of the people"" you have left that world.  The phrase is empty - it provides no information, and contributes nothing to the discussion.  Would you mind more precisely defining what you mean by ""will of the people""?",1229322602

Political initiatives would interrupt the ones we were working on and would frequently change based on whatever they felt like legislating that session or whomever was newly appointed. Not every department would be like that, but in a lot of cases there's too much outside influence by politicians to get any real work done.",1229320846

I thought of walkways as simply devices that reduced Y by n times t.  n is the velocity of the walkway and t was the time spent on it.<p>Therefore one would want to maximize t while maintaing the highest possible average walking/running speed.  E.g. it might not make sense for me to stand still on the walkway but I'd tie my shoes on it and try to reserve sprinting for regular surfaces.",1229320812

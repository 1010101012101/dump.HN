Don't do anything until you have ironed the tax problems out.<p>An ""international company"" means (to me) a corporation organized under the laws of a country other than the United States.  If you ""register"" (this is an imprecise word and could mean many things) your corporation in Delaware you have potentially exposed it to US corporate income taxation. This means that it pays tax on its profit.  Then it potentially pays tax of 30% of its after tax profit. (This is the branch profits tax). I give this as one example of the tax cow pie into which the unsuspecting foot can fall.<p>Figurre out why you are interested in entering the US. Then figure the tax exposure.  Then you will understand the ""what should I do?"" and ""who should do this for me?"" questions.<p>There are many ways you can enter the US market with a non-US company.

They have plenty of money, a huge customer base (thanks to a near monopoly on users who have years of financial data their data  locked in to their apps. the desktops apps are decent. The web apps suck.),  version control (Perforce), low turnover (no one leaves unless they are kicked out -- there is little real work to do and very high salaries, which attracts a certain type of developer). Intuit doesn't ""get"" the web and is desperately afraid of someone developing a web app to compete with their desktop apps(their own web apps are very sub par).<p>PG said in his ""Ideas we'd like to fund"" essay.<p>""21.

Even after Feynman exposed the dishonesty of the official reliability estimates, not a single bureaucrat lost his job for lying to Congress or the public about the risks (since the engineers had a good idea of the real risks, the management at NASA either knowingly lied or were effectively sticking their collective fingers in their ears and refusing to hear what the engineers said).",1250607182

770561,comment,770268,770512,0,0,designtofly,,,"That's not a fair comparison. If you looked at one of the early slides in the presentation that the slide in question came from, you can see that NASA decision makers are trying to balance three conflicting objectives: 1) Budget realities, 2) risks, and 3) benefit to stakeholders. This is no different than any corporate board. The stakeholders of NASA are the American people. As such, NASA has a duty (implicit or otherwise) to bring as much benefit to the American people as possible. It does this through several avenues. One of the biggest, and one that is often overlooked is the amount of knowledge that NASA has generated. You show me one for-profit company that has been as open as NASA at making all of their information public and available. [1] Secondly, it would be naive to think that NASA does not have an obligation to provide benefit to their stakeholders by providing jobs.<p>With this framework in mind, what objective is the car designer trying to balance when deciding to use more steel? If the writer decides to use more words, what objective are the trying to meet? The first case you bring up is ridiculous and I'm not going to address any further. The second case is more fair. The novel writer does have to balance clarity of writing and the amount of pleasure they bring to the reader. Someone buying a 50 page book is going to feel pretty ripped off if they read it in 30 minutes. Why are the Harry Potter books so damn long? Because people love to read them. She could have just as easily written the same story in a lot shorter format if she had so decided.<p>[1] <a href=""http://ntrs.nasa.gov/search.jsp"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ntrs.nasa.gov/search.jsp</a>",1250607165

In other words, did you choose Rails for Ruby, Django for Python, Cake for PHP, just because the language itself was what you knew?<p>Two years ago, I wanted ruby, but not rails.  I settled with rails and moved on to merb once that was available.<p>* Assuming you're sufficiently experienced in framework X now, what are your regrets? What makes the other frameworks look like greener grass?<p>I have a background in writing and choosing frameworks.  So I knew rails was not a fit before I used it but it was all there was if I wanted to go with ruby.  Merb still is a fit despite its relative neglect this year. I have few regrets continuing its use.<p>* If you could start your project over again, would you chose the framework again?<p>I am doing a new project now, I'm using merb again because I have invested in it and it works well.  If I were to move on, it would be for a javascript framework as I should benefit from javascript client and server.  Such js frameworks are not mature enough for my needs.<p>* Did you choose framework X secretly because you just wanted to learn it?

But, nonetheless, it meets a different important design criterion: It's delightful to explore. There are interface elements that are <i>incredibly</i> obscure, (""Why have all the application icons started shivering like they were cold?"") but once you find them it's kind of thrilling, like a magic trick, or an Easter egg.

I didn't want them to have to go to another page to figure that out since normally I believe that is considered a bad thing if they HAVE to read an about page.  You're right though that the information is a bit disjointed.  The ""What's a Launch?"" link is meant to be more of a feature tour (maybe I should just call it that).  The About page is supposed to serve as a standard about page that tells what the idea is, why it's different, etc etc.  Is it not common to have both these days?<p>I have seen the problem with the voting widget before and will look into it, thank you!  The pop-up is for category voting, the big up/down arrows are for overall.<p>To clarify, the site offers a few things:<p>a) Iterative (multiple rounds) of feedback.  The site was basically created because this seemed to be frowned upon on HN.  Maybe I won't get boo'd off stage this time since it's been two months in between!\nb) Analytics.  We track a number of specific things pertaining to your launch and then graph them for you to track how your launch is performing over time.\nc) Exposure.  Your launch is actively pushed out to our primary audience (and anyone else watching social media streams).  You also get front page attention on our site and depending on your launch's quality you could make the hottest launch or highest rated lists as well.  If your app is especially standout (like Guestlist and TweetBlocker) I'll also give it a full review/write-up on the blog.<p>HN and an ""Ask HN"" post are great ways to get feedback and exposure for your site but I think we can do better!<p>1)  HN's primary function is not to serve as an app review forum so by using Launchly in addition to HN (all you would have to do is follow on Twitter or RSS, not visit daily like HN), HN can go back to being about... well... Hacker News!  I'm not saying review my site posts do not belong here but I think there is room for a dedicated community.\n2)  Launchly offers analytics that are not offered here and a comment system that is better-suited to feedback (screenshot attachments are just the first improvement, more to come).\n3)  Many times app launches get lost in the madness that is HN and go without any (or very little) feedback.  Sometimes they end up with very little exposure as a result (heavy news day for example).  That won't happen on launchly so if you really want feedback, we would be a better option.<p>At this point in time, Ask HN may still get you more exposure than you get on launchly because of sheer numbers but we're growing and if people start participating in the community soon that won't be the case.<p>The pricing is still in flux and I'm not sure where it will end up.  It's always easier to go down than up though!  There is a Basic, free plan as I'm sure you saw.  The Plus plan adds guaranteed feedback plus the full suite of analytics.

I went looking for an even more dynamic language than Python, stayed with Perl for a while (Catalyst) and eventually went with Ruby (Rails, specifically).<p>I'm sufficiently experienced in Rails now and don't regret it at all. It is quite heavy for your average website, though... For this reason I tend to use Sinatra for lighter stuff (my personal website, etc) since it doesn't give you anything except it's base DSL for handling requests.

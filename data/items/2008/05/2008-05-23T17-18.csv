Tech investors generally don't ask precisely because they are meaningless.<p>The best you can do is look at your nearest competitor. Pro forma numbers work great for the guy who ran one hotel and is opening another down the road. They can justify using the same occupancy rate, etc.<p>Using your competitor's historic traffic data is, of course, meaningless, but to someone who is asking you for numbers that are by definiton meaningless guesses, it probably counts as justification.",1211565561
198228,comment,197970,198144,0,0,bkovitz,,,"I drank the Kool-Aid and I still like the flavor.  I still practice TDD every day.  And yet I agree with most of what you said.<p>When people get dogmatic about unit tests, they write way more than is needed to bring value.  The value is: you can refactor code more easily; you can think things through a little bit at a time and let the design evolve; the code you write tends to be really simple and easy to understand; you get executable documentation of code as a side-effect.  And for me, a huge benefit is that when pair-programming, the current test defines the current task.<p>If the unit tests are making the code harder to refactor and evolve, then it's time to write fewer of them.  And if unit testing isn't fun, then something is seriously wrong.<p>Do people not know that when you want to just explore a wild design idea, you should abandon unit testing and just go wild?",1211565467

You will never hear about many of the problems illustrated by Tamerlin, for instance, or even the lowdown on edw519's ""is the product any good?"" from the CEO if the startup is in the early, rapidly evolving phase (where the product is still fluid and trying to fit the market).<p>The CEO will give the reports filtered through management, and a major underlying reason why startups fail is that they fail to see what (or who) is important.<p>Take the technical folks to lunch.  If outside consultants are involved in, say, non-technical aspects (content development, design, etc.), take them also, but separately.  Don't bring management.  Let them talk freely and you'll get a much clearer picture of what and who is important to the company's success than you will if you only look through the CEO's eyes.",1211565267

If the concept has legs, it appears multiple places in rapid succession no matter what.<p>Also, TC has picked up things from News.YC before (hence the  'another' in your headline), and will again. Do we need an 'echo' story post every time? At best it's self-congratulatory fluff.<p>Which I brings me to the ultimate reason I didn't like this submission. I can no longer read TC directly because it's all snark, sophomoric analysis, sensationalist linkwhoring, and self-congratulatory fluff. I don't want News.YC to be thought of as a TC-feeder; I don't want hat-tips from TC to News.YC bringing more of that comment-community,  hair-trigger-attention-span, and traffic-at-any-cost attitude here.<p>So there you have it. If it's impactful news that breaks at TC, it's still a good submission here too. If it's something we already read here, or echo-chamber navel-gazing (""look, he likes us, he really really likes us!""), it dilutes the unique value proposition of this forum.",1211564895

If the business method implementation needs patentable technology to implement, then it may not be such a bad idea.<p>But again I feel that for an early stage company, filing a patent just helps mitigate the risks in the VC's head more than anything else. Forget about enforcing your patent. If you are successful and you have a lot of money and you feel like bullying your competition, we all know how some successful companies go about it.",1211564882

Most fail, and merely build a GOOD product.  Good products need sales, marketing, messaging, packaging, bizdev, etc.<p>And... FWIW, Apple spends a TON of money on marketing (but telemarketing, as you say, would be a bad way to market).  They advertise everywhere, spend a ton on packaging, do biz dev deals all over the place, and all of the expensive Apple Stores are really just a distribution/marketing tool, no?<p>Andreessen told a great story about how they literally couldn't sell their business offering until the phrase ""intranet"" started making the rounds...  Same product, different packaging/messaging, sales skyrocket.<p>How you talk about your product and how you position is (oftentimes) just as important as how good it is...

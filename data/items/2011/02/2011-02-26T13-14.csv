2265508,comment,2265444,2265444,0,0,gjenkin,,,"Context is important. A no-Photoshop approach makes sense for Quora since their product is text-heavy. For a product that requires, say, rich data visualizations like Google Analytics, some design ideas need to be mocked in a graphics package (Googlers often use Fireworks instead of Photoshop) first, then prototyped in code.<p>Context is also important in terms of what stage of the development process the designer is at. If a product design is already well defined (e.g. ""top nav is global, 2 columns in the core content space, right column is contextual nav, left column is the content stream, here's the style guide ...""), then going directly to code makes sense. As Joel suggests, going directly to code is great for day to day new feature iterations.<p>But if your product is completely undefined, Photoshop or Fireworks can be excellent tools for mocking up design variations and sets of use cases or states within those variations.<p>Hats-off to Quora for going straight to code when it comes to design. It works for them but it's not going to work for everyone in every case.",1298727972

The gas from your house is different than what you would use for your grill/outside heating you may need to change the aperture of the openings.  Walk around your house and find somewhere you would like your garden.

Due to my health issues, I don't get out much (other than  my day job) and am also home a lot.  My youngest is an introvert.  I learned a long time ago to give him the space he needs.  He and I get along well and he likes me because I lovingly leave him alone (which was completely counterintuitive for me when he was little).  My oldest and I fairly often go somewhere without my younger son.  We get to talk and he gets to be left the hell alone, by god -- which is exactly what he wants sometimes.<p>When we were still homeschooling, I had a computer in the dining area which was traffic central.  I am the most extroverted member of the family and I was fine with frequent interruptions as people passed through on the way to the kitchen/other areas and also came to me to talk about stuff.  My oldest had a computer in the corner of the living room behind a folding screen.  He was the least introverted of the three folks I lived with at the time (two sons and a husband).  He was okay with that, especially after we moved the TV out of the living room and into the master bedroom, thus eliminating the volume wars between his computer and the TV.  My youngest had a computer in his bedroom, where he could shut the door and have some peace and quiet.<p>In other words, our work stations were situated such that they matched our degree of extroversion/introversion:  The more introverted the individual, the more secluded and private and locked away their desk/computer area was.  The more extroverted they were, the more centrally located, open and accessible their desk/computer area was.  We found that the introversion/extroversion thing was a huge source of friction and finding ways to mediate that did wonders for everyone's ability to put up with each other all day long.  Other personality differences seem to be easier to get past.  This one took more effort than most other differences.  Many other differences within the family are very compatible/complementary.<p>At some point, we all did some online Meyers Briggs Personality Type test (or something very similar).  We talked about that a lot -- about how the Judgers in the family felt more need for external structure while the Perceivers were ""pilers, not filers"" and why this makes the other type crazy.  While homeschooling them, I worked a lot on teaching my sons to get along well.  These days, they never really fight, though under severe stress they do sometimes snap at each other.<p>Good luck with this.",1298727180

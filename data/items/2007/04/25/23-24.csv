16853,comment,16098,16098,0,0,stuki,,,"   Ram disks (like www.texmemsys.com) for the log device are a way of speeding up traditional rdbms'. They cost a bit, but You get to keep all the 'cool' database features while minimizing the sync log write bottleneck.\n   Such architectures are also easier to explain to auditors if Your app is of a financial nature.\n   I am not affiliated with this or any other storage vendor.\n    --Stuki\n",1177545217

This gives me a feel for how smart they are, and if they know the basics of software development.""</i><p>A trick question, of course.

16844,comment,16803,16803,0,0,falsestprophet,,,"I don't know much about Mr. Spolsky or Fog Creek, so perhaps I am entirely incorrect. I understand he has a lot of respect in the software community, but every time he writes about business it reeks of charlatanism. He seems to do well enough; but, he hasn't quite built an empire. <p>Being kind to your employees and your customers is a laudable idea, but it is not a business plan.<p>You also don't need world class intellect to build the software he is selling. This is fortunate, because I doubt his $75,000 could buy the soul of someone great who wanted to work on something important.",1177543646

It's not like people will have the same grand life after being employed by Fog Creek?<p>Then again, that's probably just life (any kind of deals, including dating). But I would almost be a suspicious - if he is trying to sell the job this hard, there might be something fishy about it? Of course Joel is not just somebody, I am sure it would be very interesting to work with him, but I mean, if it wasn't him...",1177542995

I think this is a way to pander to his future employees. :)<p>Isn't the top one percent kind of a large number?  Maybe you want the top quarter of one percent?  I mean, the majority of software developers probably work in IT doing zero innovation, not in a company that creates software that pushes boundaries.  <p>I definitely think the number of developers who are creative, passionate, smart, fast, adaptive, and good is less than 1% of all software developers.  Maybe that's accounted for because he's ignoring those who start their own startups, as they are too good for his 1% formula?\n",1177542712

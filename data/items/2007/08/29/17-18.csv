47900,comment,47803,47898,0,0,palish,,,"The question might be, ""Was R6RS ratified simply because a change is needed or because R6RS is the correct solution?""<p>On the comments, one of the very first complaints is that R6RS's library system is still inadequate.  That seems like a grave sign for any programming language.  As far as I can tell, all popular languages have a well-defined library system and popular frameworks have a well-defined plugin system, so needless hassles in terms of crafting those will only dampen popularity.

47899,comment,47874,47874,0,0,nostrademons,,,"It can be lucrative, however...<p>One of my coworkers once worked for a company that sold software to the government.  Their software didn't work - at all.  It didn't run.  However, this being the government and the company being staffed with excellent salespeople, they didn't find that out until they'd already forked over their million dollars or so.  They just ate the cost and never used the software.<p>The kicker was that the project was classified, and so the government agency couldn't <i>tell</i> anyone that the program didn't work.  Not even other government agencies.  So this company went right ahead selling the same software-that-didn't-work to multiple government agencies.  <p>Your tax dollars at work.",1188409240
47898,comment,47803,47803,0,0,dfranke,,,"About time.  I hope it isn't another decade before R7RS.<p>A lot of people are complaining because R6 is so much bigger than R5.  While a clean, tiny spec is a beautiful thing, it is empirically not a recipe for being able to get real work done without compromising portability.  If you care about minimalism more than you care about that kind of portability, R5RS isn't going anywhere.  This isn't Windows; there's no end-of-life schedule that's going to force you to upgrade.<p>My gripe about R6RS is that it doesn't go far enough: any sufficiently large project is still going to require non-portable extensions.  But it's a leap in the right direction and we've been waiting long enough.  As long as we'll eventually see an R7RS, I'm glad this revision was ratified.",1188409202

47895,comment,47597,47864,0,0,mpc,,,"Yeah I see your points. I just wanted to point out that "".net"" is different than asp.net and IIS. Those are part of the complete default stack and are typical bottlenecks. In a way they're designed to achive easy development/deployment over performance. <p>asp.net out-of-the-box will not work for a massively concurrent public facing app. However, neither will php, rails, django, any of the java frameworks. ""re-invent the wheel"" might be an overstatement for what you need to do, but no matter what...you're going to do some serious tweaking since every app has different needs",1188408397

It's not gorgeous, but it's far from ugly.<p>There is definitely a point when certain kinds of beauty become uninviting to certain kinds of people.  It's like room with furniture so fancy that one feels uncomfortable, like an intruder, just by sitting on it.

And when an EC2 instance goes down, you can have another one booted within minutes, compared to the days/weeks that it might take to get another physical machine set up.<p>That's not even to mention scaling issues; right now I'm managing a stack of over 50 EC2 instances, and it's easily manageable by a single person (most of those are in a load balanced array, and they'll come up and go down automatically as load dictates).

So where does your source code live?  Inside of a file called YourImageName.changes, which contains <i>every single line of Smalltalk you execute</i>, including everything from class definitions to method renames to one-offs in workspaces and so on.<p>If you blow up your image, you simply start with a new one, open a change sorter on your old .changes file, and file in the exact pieces you want, skipping over the part where you, say, accidentally did ""Integer become: Boolean"" or something equally stupid.<p>So far, so good: your code is indeed in text, and it's always up-to-date, and it's trivially machine parsable.  So what's the issue?<p>The issue, for me, is that <i>there isn't, by default, a dump of code that represents your program as it exists right now</i>.  With that trivial change, using traditional source-control becomes a royal pain the ass, if not outright impossible.  That's why you see almost zero Smalltalk code on sites like GitHub, even though the community's active: they end up developing their own systems, such as Monticello, and their own hosting solutions, like SqueakSource and SmalltalkHub, that work with Smalltalk .changes files, rather than Smalltalk code living in text files.<p>If Smalltalk made one-file-per-class, or something similar, the default, and if it automatically generated ""compacted"" changes on a regular basis (basically a .changes with all of the stuff you deleted thrown out--in other languages, you'd call these the source files), then I think it'd go a long way to helping adoption.  Hell, as a side-benefit, writing Smalltalk code in Emacs would be a lot easier, for those who like that particular path.  But in the meantime, that's the way things work.",1325271397

CompuServe, which arrived pretty early in the greater scheme, was founded in 1969 as a time sharing computer service. It wasn't until quite a bit later that it became a packet-switched computer network, likely in response to the success of ARPAnet's implementation.<p>In contrast, the plans for ARPAnet were finished in 1968, and the system was operational in 1969. The concept was pretty pie in the sky at the time, and it's likely that the success of ARPA led to commercial implementations of packet-switched networks.<p>Additionally, the early private networks did not have the character of the ""public Internet"" which is a crucial component of the Internet we know and love today. Indeed, the reason we care about SOPA is that the public Internet, and not a patchwork of private internets, won the day.",1325271317

3408636,comment,3407656,3407656,0,0,billpatrianakos,,,"I just had to go through this and was forced to learn these tips myself recently. Before I discovered HN I was a PHP guy. I knew it. Used it. Was comfortable with it. Then I came lurking around here and found out that I wasn't cool because I didn't know Ruby and therefore Rails. Then I found out that I wasn't cool because I was using Apache instead of Nginx or nodejs. So I read about all that stuff for most of this year, played with getting Ruby to spit out arrays in reverse and organize them in different ways, got a VPS and installed Nginx and then at the end realized that all I got from it was an Nginx server serving up a static unfinished website in HTML and the knowledge of how to play with arrays in Ruby (and just in irb, not even in a web page!).<p>The moral of the story is that reading is useless without action. It's easy to fall into analysis paralysis even if you're decently experienced.<p>I've come to almost despise the hipsters (and that word is so apt for describing them) who are too cool to do things the standard, time tested way. It's one thing to go bleeding edge for the sake of experimentation and furthering your knowledge and skill but when you're off using some esoteric language or framework or whatever just to be different or cool then that's really... Well... Lame for lack of a better word. Like wearing some ridiculous outfit ""to be different"" and claiming its just fashion that the rest of us are too uncool to get.<p>I eventually did get out of that unproductive cycle by the way. I am learning Rails but I've put more of my energies into actually producing things that work using uncool but very useful languages, practices, and frameworks. Sometimes the cool kids are wrong. It's more important to get something produced and working well than it is to use some hip technology because the cool kids claim its better. Ive found that a lot of these claims of some tech stack being better either all boil down to some very narrow use case or give you some benefit that's really negligible in the grand scheme of things. Take it with a grain of salt. Read a bit but don't get hung up on the hype. Make something.",1325271135

3408632,comment,3407506,3407506,0,0,algoshift,,,"I've had the experience of having company contact data stolen via a Linkedin account.<p>I hired a salesman for one of my businesses.  He had limited sales experience but I was willing to train.  His Linkedin account had maybe on or two dozen contacts.  I watched as he systematically added contacts to the account over a year.  Nearly all of these contacts came out of our business activities.  By the end of the year he was in the hundreds of contacts.  The relationship wasn't working out and I had to let him go.  He went to work for a competitor.  Not only was he armed with the knowledge from this one year ""training program"" but now he had a who's-who of the industry in his LinkedIn account.  Business can really suck sometimes.<p>Some of these contacts were developed after non-trivial financial and monetary investments.  For example, we were spending about $250K per year going to tradeshows.  Some of these contacts came from relationships built over making contact with people repeated times at various tradeshows spread over several years.  In some cases the tradeshow activity was followed-up by in-person visits at the customer site.  One could easily argue that some of the contacts easily cost tens of thousands of dollars to develop.<p>Who owns these contacts and relationships?  I think it is very clear that the business does.  I also understand that this is not a trivial problem.  These days it is nearly impossible to control the exodus of internal data, be it contacts, code or design data (electronics, mechanical).  One personal Dropbox account and an employee can move hard drives worth of data out of your business.  Agreements not to do so are only worth the paper they are on.

Who picks the best results? Certainly not the federal government under a Paul administration. Many supporters counter by stating that people can just move to another state... but unfortunately for the poor moving is almost impossible.<p>You say that <i>we</i> then pick the best result from the states, but that seems contradictory to Ron Paul's message.<p>Finally, the Constitution was written by rich white individuals who were basically looking after their own well-being (I may be overcritical, but you can decide whether I am or not by reanalyzing it). This requires critical analysis and a historical background: but how many clauses benefit the rich? how many the poor? how many benefit slave owners?

We ran surveys to ask our customers for feedback, and tried to only build things that we had validated they wanted.  That seemed lean.<p>Several weeks ago, one of our investors, a three-time successful entrepreneur (his last company is doing close to $50MM in revenue this year) told me that his current endeavor was failing and he couldn't figure out why.  After reading Lean Startup, he realized he had been lucky three times in a row, succeeding despite himself.  He encouraged me and my team to read the actual book.<p>Long story short, @dasil003 is right, the problem with the explosion of Lean is that everyone writes tidbits about it and most people read those tidbits and think they're being ""lean"", but most, including myself, were misinformed about how to actually be lean.  Not to mention, applying the true principles of lean is <i>not easy</i>.  In fact, it's quite painful.  But doing it half-ass leads to potentially even worse decision making than just operating a hunch-based business.<p>Earlier this week, after taking a step back and identifying our true core metrics, we launched a real lean dashboard with cohort testing and deep analytics into the health of our company.  We have already run one successful cohort of 3 variations on a feature that we thought might help improve engagement, most of it was a relative smokescreen.  All three implementations were nearly the same, but only one actually had a noticeable impact.  Previously, we would have built one of them, seen that people used it (but not necessarily known the impact it had to company health) and would have moved onto the next feature.  There would have been a 2 out of 3 chance that it was an unsuccessful implementation.  And in those 2 out of 3 cases, even though maintaining that worthless feature would take ongoing resources, we would have kept it because it appeared people were using it, even though the impact to metrics that matter was close to zero.<p>It's safe to assume that the majority of our features have worked at a fraction of what they could have.  Without identifying the true metrics that are going to make your company great, without real cohort testing, and without trying things in <i>literally</i> the lowest resource way possible, you are wasting massive amounts of energy and money.  I can already tell that we are going to learn more about our product and business in the next 3-4 months than the whole previous 2 years.<p>Talking about Lean is a fad.

The highly iterative nature of it and the rigorous hypothesis testing is pretty clear to explain, and it really grabs people who get it.<p>A while back I mentored at a Lean Startup Machine event. Basically you take a weekend, come up with a product idea, and then tackle it in the Lean Startup fashion. One team came up with an idea for a photo-related product. Saturday morning they were arguing endlessly about the right features in the typical product meeting fashion.<p>After hearing the ""get outside the building"" mantra about 7000 times, they finally did it. They went down to Fisherman's Wharf and did quick interviews with actual people. They discovered that almost everything they were arguing about didn't matter to real potential customers. So they came back and produced some mockups of a very different product, one based on what real people said they wanted. They went back out again with the mockups, did more interviews, and revised again.<p>Then they took what they had learned, built a simple landing page, and drove traffic against it. They did A/B tests to see what price people liked and how to pitch it. By Sunday afternoon, they had a list of people who were ready to pay money for their product. In a weekend, they had made progress that would have taken many companies months just by eliminating a lot of pointless bullshit.<p>It was amazing to watch, and they totally got it. One of the people on the team went back to work, endured a couple of idiotic product meetings, and quit his job. Last I heard he was building iPad apps and loving it.",1325270319

He was doing content-based networking even back when he was at Cisco.<p>To an extent I think recognized by a lot of networking researchers, including IIRC YC's Robert Morris at MIT, the future of the Internet is probably not IPv6 and a network consisting of operating systems addressed by scalar integers.<p>Instead, IP-type protocols are going to assume the same role that Ethernet and 802.11 (and ATM) play today, as a substrate for connectivity on top of which real applications will be built. The wide area discovery and ""session"" (OSI style) management roles played by IP and TCP will be played by overlay networks. We have primitive overlays now (DHTs, BitTorrent, Skype) and proprietary ones (CDNs like Akamai, whatever the cable content providers are using to push VOD to the edge), but eventually we'll get a general-purpose open one and the game will be on.<p>I think this follows straightforwardly from Reed's end-to-end argument. Intelligence belongs to the edges, not the core of the network; intelligence at the core is necessarily a lowest-common-denominator affair, and is hard to scale. That's a key reason why we don't have multicast today. Routers are so bad at scale that tier 1 NSPs filtered BGP announcements by prefix length, because they couldn't handle /32-granular routing for even the tiny subset of machines that actually wanted it (begging the question of how we ever expect IPv6 to do the things the typical HN reader hopes they'll do, like provide them with their own portable /16-equivalents). Multicast effectively asked those same overtaxed routers to address <i>web pages</i>, <i>individually</i>.<p>That's obviously not going to work when the service model involves random people demanding that AT&T and Level3 add routing table entries for their podcasts. But it scales just fine when the thousands of machines interested in those podcasts share a protocol and an infrastructure for arranging a fan-out overlay.<p>So many unsolved problems here, from ""what is the most reasonable kernel of overlay assembly, group management, and routing to deploy to end-systems"" to ""how do we avoid congestion collapse in arbitrary group messaging protocols"" (a study of multicast reliability algorithms --- at least, from the late 90s when I last did this stuff --- will probably horrify you).

The gas stations start to spread out the further from civilization I go, but I've never gone more than a quarter to half a tank of gas before seeing another. (I have a phobia about running out of gas in the middle of nowhere.)<p>But the difficult part it is thinking about how gas stations are set up. There is definitely a relationship between population density and gas station count. The less people, the less gas stations -- but conversely there seems to be a point where the population is so saturated (SF proper) that gas stations are scarce inside the city.<p>But maybe I just think that because of the relative distances I'm traveling. Inside the city I'm walking and see less gas stations, but outside the city I'm driving and covering a longer distance in the same amount of time and see more gas stations.<p>Also, we seldom see huge lines at the gas stations which means they are plentiful enough to service all available commuting cars without significant queue. If there are just enough to service cars without a queue, maybe we can say this (naively):<p>X number of people in the US. Three people per family, so X/3 = Y number of cars. (A lot of families have more than one car, I know) If each gas station has an average of Z pumps and is utilized constantly at an average of W% through the day, we need at least Y * Z * W% gas stations to service everyone appropriately.",1325269625

Listening can be boring but these techniques enable you to listen hours (even with a smile on your face) without getting bored. It's so damn important that I stress it again: you should listen 95% and talk just 5% (from now on meetings aren't fun or a relaxing break, they become hard, boring work).<p>- Always 1-to-1 meetings—always. Every meeting with more than two people is worthless, try to avoid them, if you can't just keep them short and full of small-talk, fun and non-sense but without decisions. Harsh words, but leading is not anymore about cookie-cutting talks with colleagues. That's one of the big downsides of leading.<p>- Don't focus too much on your staff—look that they are happy and motivated (most important) and they have always challenging work, that's it. Don't try to be all the time around them—if they need help be there. Don't change your communication, just be yourself, but don't think they are your friends. Focus now on next steps within the company—you are now doing first steps in management and your work changed from working yourself to networking, to give and take and last but not least to power politics (if your startup is >100 employees). Look that you spend more time with peers from other departments and higher level peers in your company. If you can't progress or your company sucks in less than 12 months, look that you spend a lot time outside your company (there're lots of ways) and move on.<p>- Don't use tactics or manipulative techniques even if you are good in it. People always feels there's something wrong. Be yourself but keep distance.<p>- Get a mentor or coach with leadership experience in highly volatile environments, preferably outside the company<p>- Because working oneself is still most fun, look that you keep coding on private projects, even while in office (there're lots of ways). That's good for your own motivation and keeps your coding skills fresh. Otherwise you burnout after 6 months of all the meetings, mails and bullshit. That's important because from now on you will slowly loose close relationships within the corporation, upcoming relations are different, more political and it's important to stay grounded, meet lot of people (again leave your company often, go to meetups, because there you can just be yourself and that makes you happy; if you don't do this you'll quickly degenerate and get isolated because the working contacts are less and less true relationships). To officially code yourself is not an option anymore (which is sad) because after the first bigger mistake your management will tell your that you are not able to lead your folks when they see you coding with them (which would be better but non-technical management and c-level just don't get it)<p>These are all only very small hints without giving you the big picture which would take more time and there is no book giving a really deep understanding (I've seen many books before I had my first leadership position, none of them is written by real leaders).<p>If you want more advice: renmarksky at live.com",1325269306

I can relate to the frustration that most Americans seem to have towards “Washington”, but would this really be in the best interest of the country?<p>It's 2011, not 1787. The US is a vastly different country than it was when the idea of States Rights was created. Would the level of innovation that you describe be possible in a country that does not have a strong central government?  Could an individual State put someone on the moon?  Would sectors of the economy that are closely associated with a specific area (Technology – CA etc) still be as prosperous without a central government? I am skeptical.<p>Abandoning the Federal Government because it is dysfunctional seems short sighted. Personally I do not see how the US can prosper in the modern world without a central government.  We need more political compromise and a more consistent government agenda, not a shift towards one political agenda. Government should represent everyone, not just the 51% of constituents that elected them this term.<p>Also, suggesting that human rights should be legislated at a State level is absurd. It astounds me that a Libertarian such as Paul can so proudly proclaim that government intrusion is wrong, but then defer to the State on issues such as gay marriage and abortion.

The Internet was originally designed in a TCP/IP point-to-point structure, with the most important aspects being the communication of two parties. Now the most important part is that a given party (or really many parties) receive a specific piece of content, regardless of where that content comes from. In this light, it is wise to redesign the Internet's infrastructure against standard TCP/IP and instead build knowledge of content and caching layers directly into the transport protocols.<p>The preliminary paper which deals with many of these issues is Jacobson's Networking Named Content[1]. The general idea is that one requests content instead of communication with a specific party. ISPs and other intermediate layers cache content blocks (because its in their own financial best interests by saving money in peering costs and pure networking hardware costs) and your request for content is delivered via the nearest available hot cache. Many other papers have been written with their own tweaks, but this is the general idea for what the next generation of the Internet should look like (from the distributed systems researcher perspective). In my Distributed Systems in Challenging Environments class one of the things my partners and I were working on was building a prototype of CCN (the protocol described in Jacobson's paper) on top of the current TCP/IP layer to examine its real-world characteristics and swarm behavior. We never completely finished the prototype for Contemplating Content Centric Protocols, but it was an interesting project nonetheless.<p>[1] <a href=""http://conferences.sigcomm.org/co-next/2009/papers/Jacobson.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://conferences.sigcomm.org/co-next/2009/papers/Jacobson....</a>",1325268689

I can see the confusion: people who aren't part of this culture see that as a set of racist, irrational beliefs that lead to stop-and-frisk harassment and profiling in airports, whereas Ron Paul obviously has a cultural fear of people different from himself and doesn't equate that with skin color except by correlation.  He doesn't consider this ""racism"", and thus is offended by the implications.<p>We disagree on the terms and on whether or not it is a disqualifying feature for the highest office in the land, but we should at least be able to agree that the only evidence we have for what he believes have been the things he's done or said.  That he began claiming he never did them when they became politically inconvenient doesn't mean he's changed his mind.<p>I wouldn't care what he said 20 years ago if he stood up and said, ""yes, I said those things.  Since then, however, I have spent more time with people from cultures I had previously been isolated from and feared, as many of us do when faced with the unfamiliar.

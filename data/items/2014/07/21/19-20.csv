Bitcoin can be sent and received by any person in the world, in any amount, at any time, for any reason. That&#x27;s why Bitcoin is important. Bitcoin is _not_ important if it just compliments the existing banking system&#x27;s functions, or makes it cheaper.

It&#x27;s much worse to buy Bitcoin at the wrong time than to pay 2.9% on every transaction. But as a payment platform, as far as venture capitalists are concerned, it&#x27;s fabulously successful.

Then you use a decentralized network of exchanges to restore any ratios you want to maintain.<p>This allows people to create their own currency and enforce it&#x27;s particular use, backing it explicitly. For example, you could crate &#x27;SoylentCoin&#x27;, which can be cashed in for 1 month of Soylent shipped by a certain date. You sell it for some price that keeps you in business, but then the market is free to trade it at-will and you can hit more efficient price points for your product. Sometimes you might find that your product is worth a lot more than you are selling it for.<p>Or in a decentralized example, you could do proof-of-resource sale that sells coins directly transferable to a type of resource. In example of disk storage, you provide storage to the network in return for disk-coins. To get the storage, you need to buy disk-coins. This isolates the disk-coin price to the supply and demand of disk storage precisely. Anyone can participate, and upon buying or selling the disk-coin, they can immediately convert to or from whatever portfolio of coins they personally maintain.",1405969529

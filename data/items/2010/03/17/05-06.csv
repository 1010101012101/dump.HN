I can honestly say that 80% of women I have met at 5 different companies have been on some kind of psychological medication to cope with the stress at work.  (Goodbye many useful innovations from female employees.)<p>b) I have met people who work 15 hour days; albeit where work consists of 6 hours of doing nothing, 4 hours of work, and then another 5 hours of waiting for the boss to leave. (Reasons include saving face - and poor housing conditions.)<p>c) The best university graduates tend to go directly to big companies; they don't create their own companies, because of the number of practical difficulties. (being accepted for & paying for rental properties, getting loans, etc..)<p>d) Everything has a big city perspective, since practically everyone has to come to Tokyo to do something important.<p>I can go through a hundred reasons; but the idea that there is some simple cultural issue that could be chopped away like a Gordian knot to solve the problem is a bit too simplistic.",1268805515

I don't live in California, in fact you'd probably find me dead before you'd find me living in most parts of California other than San Fran or San Diego (certainly not LA thats for sure). I'd probably rather live in Kansas than an equivalent city in California simply to avoid the horrible taxes and dysfunctional gov't.<p>But I do get the desire to live in a big city over a suburb. I've worked in a city for the last few years after growing up in a suburb, and waking up in the morning and walking through the energy of a  city is just different than waking up, getting in your car, slogging through traffic to work, parking in a giant lot, and going into a corporate office park for the day.

Search is a fundamental web activity that isn't mutually exclusive from ""social surfacing"" for discovering content.  Rather, they are complimentary to each other and the main points of differentiation are with branding and marketing rather than any specific shift toward one or the other.<p>I also think its a bit simplistic to state 'Facebook works the way humans work' as people hear about stuff through numerous other channels than the people around them (ie: nyt.com dining & wine section for a new restaurant).<p>The 'crazy AI gymnastics' Google is doing isn't for nothing.  I actually think those gymnastics are advancing the web in ways other companies aren't.  There will always be some overhead to interacting with your friends on the web and those gymnastics Google is doing make the web a better platform for people to interact with (more like your friend).",1268805381

1197932,comment,1196996,1197143,0,0,cullenking,,,"Garmin isn't getting ""eaten alive"" by the smartphone market.  Yes, Garmin, Navteq and others had market share eaten by navigation services on smartphones, however you are neglecting the fact a smart phone isn't a GPS.  Try using a smartphone in a small airplane, boat, bicycle or while hiking.  Garmin and crew are going nowhere, they may just lose the in-car navigation market to a certain extend.  However, even that is a maybe/maybe not, because Garmin and all develop the navigation systems for stock cars.  Plus, many older users will not buy a mount to put their tiny cellphone screen close enough to makeout, they'll use a giant in-car GPS system from one of the big manufacturers.<p>There is definitely no PR disaster.  The site isn't knocking Garmin at all.  In all actuality, the people creating the site do not seem disgruntled one bit.  They seem proud of the work they did, they rep Garmin products and seem in good spirits.  Sorry, but your analysis is way off.",1268805292

As to the international issue, we will get there in time, but it is not so simple.  We want to get the US stronger first, and the international data sources are sparser and not the same as those we use already.<p>Algorithm:\nWe're working really hard on making our algorithm better and integrating new data sources as new features to learn from.  We do a lot of very hard data transformation and feature extraction in order to get the feature vectors our models learn from.  We just underwent a major overhaul of our Hadoop and Cascading infrastructure, and our research environment is setting us up to be able to do a lot of cool stuff now.  You can find the code for our cascading lib here: <a href=""http://github.com/clj-sys/cascading-clojure"" rel=""nofollow"">http://github.com/clj-sys/cascading-clojure</a><p>User Experience:\nWe wrestle with the kinds of issues you raise on a daily basis.  It is tricky to have a user facing probabilistic model.  As you point out, some folks look for certain outcomes, and don't do so well with probabilities.  Others love to geek out on as much data as possible and want an even more fine grained information dashboard.  It not easy to satisfy both groups with a single experience, although we're exploring different user experiences right now that try.  As to the crowd sourcing, we've talked about social media integration, and it does seem like it would help people interact more to share the best current data with Flightcaster and our other users.

If that was the case, the founders/managers running the place would have walked just as free as the Engineer would have;  the investors would have just lost the money they invested.<p>(the entire system is biased towards letting people 'just walk' -  unless you are so small that you need to personally co-sign your loans/leases/etc... like I do.)<p>I mean, I'm not saying a employer who pays people salary instead of stock options is evil;  I mean, as long as everyone knows the score ahead of time, that's fine. (In fact, that's what I do with my employees.   The downside of this is that as you can't attract people who are as experienced or otherwise desirable as you could with options, and people leave you for better paying gigs as they gain experience sooner than they would if they had stock options.)<p>I'm just saying, the way most (not small-time) corps are structured, the founders have an opportunity to protect their personal assets in case of corporate bankruptcy.  And even in the case of small companies like mine (I have a corp, but the protection means nothing; nobody gives me jack without a personal co-sign.  I'm tiny.)    American bankruptcy laws are pretty liberal, assuming it's business debit, and not tax debit, so sometimes you can still walk.  (I do know several people who were 'ruined' by screwing up their taxes enough to get a giant, long-term debit.)",1268802904

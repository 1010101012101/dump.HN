He differentiates this with &quot;investing&quot;, where you simply try to assess the intrinsic value of a stock, and if the stock is trading at a significant discount to it, then you buy it.<p>Further, once you&#x27;ve bought it, you keep it. You don&#x27;t try to time the ups and downs of the market, buying moving and out of the position quickly. Since this is how Buffett likes to invest, one of his key principles is investing in owner-operators or people that are behaving as such. You want the executives of the company to treat it as if they owned all the stock and could never sell it. Because when you have the people running the company worrying about next quarter, you&#x27;re not worrying about next decade.<p>Also related, Buffett&#x27;s two key rules to investing:<p>Rule #1.

Don&#x27;t get me wrong, it might work out fine with the right individual.<p>But there are two other reasonably likely scenarios:<p>() A gung-ho technical person who becomes frustrated by having their ideas and opinions overuled by a non-technical person. And in the original scenario, the non-technical person is not working flat out to make the product take off.<p>() A not so gung-ho technical person who is mainly collecting a paycheck until the money runs out. This may be a later edition of the first or someone who comes onboard with that idea - keeping in mind that the business partner plans on spending their time at another job.<p>It&#x27;s not the money, it&#x27;s the passive model of investment that to me makes success look less likely. Or to put it another way, why wouldn&#x27;t the sort of technical person who can conjure up a product out of a text file want to team up with a business person who will sell a million of them before a line of code is written?<p>Or at least a business partner who is trying to sell a million of them before any code is written?<p>Being in it together really requires being in it at the same time or a track-record of trustworthiness.<p>Good luck.",1376709863

E.g., <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-aYEOsZgRm8"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-aYEOsZgRm8</a>   So in that sense Buffett does think &quot;playing the market&quot; is a loser&#x27;s game (that&#x27;s played by &quot;speculators&quot;, not &quot;investors&quot;), though I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s specifically addressed in the linked letter.",1376709001

The reason is that market indices measure the mean (the sum of all the values divided by the count of values), not the median (the midpoint between the highest and lowest value).<p>> On the second count, that&#x27;s like saying that math is the foundation of computing, and so the two are indistinguishable.<p>And? I invite you to argue that it&#x27;s not so. Computers do what they do solely on mathematical and logical principles. Some would argue that that represents a drawback, hence experiments with things like fuzzy logic. But even fuzzy logic is deterministic and logical, it&#x27;s just sometimes closer to messy reality. But all of computer science, and computer operations, are strictly logical.<p>> ... klodolph is correct that the two are different ...<p>Computer science and mathematics? Only someone unfamiliar with computer science would make that claim. Computer science is applied mathematics.<p>> ... so you should acknowledge the minor correction ...<p>Are you familiar with the idea that, if you make an argument, the burden is yours to produce evidence for it? Computer science is applied mathematics.<p>> Buffet suggests (and advocates) an alternative (his #5) that is NOT fully respectful of the efficient market hypothesis.<p>But that&#x27;s not the topic. Whether the EMH is reflected in the real market or not, the issue is whether someone can consistently beat the market averages for reasons other than chance. These are separate, independent topics.<p>> Buffet claims that there may or may not exist investors who have superior (or inferior) skill, but that in MOST cases the results are due to luck, and &quot;skilled&quot; investors are mostly indistinguishable from lucky investors. Although I have not seen you agree or disagree with this claim ...<p>The reason I haven&#x27;t either agreed or disagreed is because there&#x27;s no way to establish it scientifically, with evidence. So I disagree that Buffett can make the case, and for the same reason, I can&#x27;t make the case either. That leaves us with the null hypothesis -- without evidence, the thesis is assumed to be false.<p>> More generally, did you notice that your top-level comment was basically saying &quot;Warren Buffet is wrong about this aspect of investing&quot;?<p>If you invent quotes for people, we won&#x27;t get anywhere. I can only say that Buffett can&#x27;t make his case, and I have said that. That leaves us with the default scientific position -- the null hypothesis.

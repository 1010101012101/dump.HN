You need a proportional system. On paper. With hand counting by volunteers overseen by party reps. Stop with all the private enterprise technology stuff. Democracy is too precious to contract out to some lowest bidder. The Australian Electoral Commission runs all our ballots here and I have absolute confidence in them.

I'm confused, you say that its not a vulnerability, yet Facebook had to take action. I guess seeing is believing and it only took a public disclosure to see the light.

I really think it is a shame they didn't just use a standard packaging system like .deb to handle things. The server instances are already Ubuntu... it seems like a natural extension to just support setting up a list of .deb files to load into an instance and have it 'just work'.<p>I needed recent ImageMagick/Ghostscript binaries and I spent many hours trying to get Vulcan to work and finally gave up. It is a mess and not documented very well. Someone commented on your blog that they've moved to another system (anvil) to deal with compiling binaries. I can see why they did this... so much unplanned stuff was bolted onto Vulcan it finally just stopped working entirely. It ended up being easier to just write a shell script, but this certainly isn't as sexy as using Vulcan or just installing a source .deb. <a href=""https://github.com/lookfirst/convert/wiki/Compile"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/lookfirst/convert/wiki/Compile</a><p>ddollar seems like a very smart, but very busy guy.

This facet seems to be often forgotten, but the main point of Data Science is optimizing businesses. Learn about how Big Co. is working, how they tried to solve the problem of Big Data, read about Data Mining, Datawarehousing, ERPs, and other approaches.<p>There are some other established fileds from where to find great insight, like Operations Research, but these two are the ones you <i>must</i> incorporate in your thinking habits to get the right holistic view.

Others would probably trash it more quickly.\nI did get a very thoughtful response from David which actually helped us immensely.

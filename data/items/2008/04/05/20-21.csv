155788,comment,155761,155761,0,0,rguzman,,,"A more useful piece of data would perhaps be the ratio of entrants to the software industry to the demand for them and a projection of this number to 5,10 and 15 years.  For instance, the percentage of freshmen majoring in physics is abysmally low, but the selectivity of graduate programs says that is not enough demand for them.",1207428674

The psychology and effectiveness of decision-making strategies could fill up books (and they have).<p>The scenario I had in mind is one where you have some limited set of options, a consensus is necessary, and the overhead of measuring the effectiveness of the alternatives isn't too high.<p>In those situations you're going to argue until someone gives in, someone higher up tells you to knock it off and makes a decision for you, or you decide to see which alternative actually does best.",1207428244

This sort of experience is the basis for most intuition. Some people are really, really good at it, too.<p>The right kind of experiences can be data, too, but there are two dangers: (1) not being wiling to change your mind and (2) acting off too little experience.<p>I just expect that any ""expert"" whose intuition I'm supposed to trust will be able to justify their opinion when push comes to shove.",1207427862

It results in fewer pointless arguments and better decisions overall.",1207427826

There'll be a boom and a bust, but the diving price of solar is going to revolutionize the world nonetheless.",1207427746

155776,comment,155442,155442,0,0,comatose_kid,,,"Good topic, but one line doesn't do enough justice.  I want to know <i>why</i> people chose who they did.  So forgive the length of my reply.<p>1)  Personally, I'd have to say Matthew Halfant.  I worked for him at VM Labs around y2k.  Apart from his prodigious mathematical ability, he was a collaborator with Abelson and Sussman (of SICP fame) back in the 80s.  More importantly he was a very kind mentor to me, and a great teacher.  I still recall at my interview how he remarked it was nice to have a 'young fellow such as myself come aboard because I could teach them a thing or two.'  Yeah, right!  His willingness to hire me is what brought me to Silicon Valley.<p>I only wish I had asked him more about Lisp :)<p>2)  I don't know Woz personally, but he's awesome because he achieved the pinnacle of 'ultimate engineer' through intense dedication to his craft, and also (and equally importantly) by retaining a playful, childlike attitude throughout his career.",1207426932

155773,comment,155688,155688,0,0,aneesh,,,"I agree that data-driven decisions are less common than they should be.  However, there is such a thing as over-dependence on data, and this piece might be toying with the line.  You don't have enough resources to test every little thing - sometimes you have to use your intuition and move on.",1207426774

155767,comment,155442,155442,0,0,rglovejoy,,,"In no particular order:<p>Richard Feynman - For his integrity and for insisting on skepticism and rigor in everything.<p>Robert Heinlein - Along with John W. Campbell, he brought science fiction away from ray-guns and bug-eyed monsters and made it interesting and thought-provoking.  A lot of people went into science and engineering because of his influence.<p>Raoul Wallenberg - He stood up to the Nazis and Hungarian fascists to prevent thousands of people from being sent to the death camps.<p>Douglas Bader - PG mentioned him in his essay; this is a man who lost his legs in a flying accident.  His disability didn't stop him from joining the Royal Air Force and piloting a fighter plane during the War.  Not once did he feel sorry for himself; instead he was flying over Europe killing Nazis.<p>Norm Zadah - He went from being a professor of CS at Stanford to running a hedge fund and being a championship poker player.  When a female friend of his was rejected from Playboy, he went ahead and started his own magazine, Perfect 10.  So far, he's lost nearly $46 million on Perfect 10, and he's switched to web distribution, but he doesn't care, he likes his work.  Truly a renaissance man.",1207426241

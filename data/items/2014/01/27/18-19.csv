7132264,comment,7130668,7131591,5,0,grey-area,,,"Welcome to the internet - any public internet-facing service needs to be regularly updated, as all of them (apache, openssh, .net, rails, php, java apps, off the shelf things like wordpress) have multiple exploits discovered regularly, and bots randomly try urls at servers to try to take over the machine. That&#x27;s not a very pleasant experience and often isn&#x27;t clear to the client/users, but that&#x27;s the cost of being on the internet.<p>No matter which framework or application you are talking about (including Word as it happens, if anyone mails you docs), you&#x27;re running a risk if you run software which is old. On the desktop you&#x27;ll mostly get away with this, but when it is exposed to the internet directly, the timeframe before someone tries to exploit you is probably measured in minutes, not years. You can still easily lose data/time/money by using out of date desktop software like XP, Acrobat or Word though.<p>I agree the article doesn&#x27;t give a good clear explanation of costs and benefits, and is mixing up two things - regular upgrades to software for security, and upgrades to software for other reasons (like additional features or making the dev&#x27;s life easier). Often in bigger companies these jobs are split, but in smaller companies you might pay your developer to be sysops, developer, backup specialist and all-round computer person, so they tend to do both (and mix up both in quotes). Whatever tech you choose to use, you&#x27;ll find you incur similar costs for maintenance (in my experience at least), though perhaps not these costs. It mixes up too many concepts (security, features, maintenance), which is a bit confusing and I could see being frustrating as a business owner who wants to pay for new features, not pay for keeping old ones. Unfortunately running software on the internet comes with a maintenance cost, which should be explained to clients up front as a separate cost from development, because the reasons for doing it (security) are mostly separate, and it&#x27;s more like maintaining your server than website/app development (it should also include updating your web server software for example).",1390848721

And depending on the strategy of the hired guns aka lawyers doing the fighting that effort could be measured in all manner of things, money, labor time, clock time, paperwork, nuisances, things of that nature.  But fundamentally if they decide they own you, you need to figure out how much it&#x27;ll cost to gain your freedom, and are you willing to pay it.

The list of features implies that I will effectively only get screencasts that I don&#x27;t get from github repositories and depending on your language there are lots of places to get those too (ex [3]).<p>Don&#x27;t get me wrong, I am all for monetizing, but I greedily want something if I am going to pay for it.<p>[1] <a href=""https://github.com/explore"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/explore</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.rent-acoder.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.rent-acoder.com/</a><p>[3] <a href=""http://devblog.avdi.org/2013/06/21/a-list-of-programming-screencast-series/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://devblog.avdi.org/2013/06/21/a-list-of-programming-scr...</a><p>EDIT: formatting",1390848155

Take the simple case of &quot;tell me what range of values to expect here&quot;. Java / C++ deal with this with their types, and you can be reasonably confident that you&#x27;re getting the object you expect. As I&#x27;m sure somebody will mention, those types are a bit weak, and can&#x27;t guarantee the object you get is exactly what you expect. What if you don&#x27;t test with the right sub-class? What if it&#x27;s an int, but it&#x27;s out of the range you expect?<p>&quot;No, that&#x27;s not what types guarantee!&quot; you may say. And it&#x27;s true.<p>I think one of the problems is that language features aren&#x27;t perfect. Forcing everybody to admit they&#x27;re dealing with integers is more desirable than no contract at all, but would it be better if you dealt with Scores, which where integers in the range of 0-100?<p>In a big enough codebase, the language is never powerful enough to handle all your checking for you, so you need some level of discipline.

This style of development is typical for people using R, Matlab, Lisp, or any language featuring a REPL.

7132039,comment,7130668,7131784,15,0,aaronem,,,"tl;dr: &quot;Rails: Not even once.&quot;<p>Everything in Rails is so much work because Rails is a rolling disaster; every new major version replaces enormous chunks of framework functionality with enormous <i>new</i> chunks of functionality, which imposes a heavy load on the developer; &quot;convention over configuration&quot;, plus major changes to the convention <i>du jour</i> in every major version, equals a necessity to re-learn, at every major version change, where the new magic lurks and precisely how it works. If I&#x27;m being entirely fair, I can&#x27;t say that the Rails developers have <i>no</i> interest in backwards compatibility, but such interest in my experience is both quite spotty and heavily concentrated on obvious and conventional behavior, which means anything non-obvious or unconventional is probably going to need heavy rework. (I have yet to run across a Rails app which did not, at least occasionally, do something non-obvious or unconventional, and necessarily so; no framework can cover <i>every</i> use case, but Rails in particular seems interested in covering only the most common ca. 60%.)<p>To make matters worse, no one in the Rails community has the slightest interest in yesterday, and even today tends to be neglected in favor of tomorrow. You talk of entire books on the subject of Rails deployment, and while the necessity for such books to exist is certainly a problem, actually <i>having</i> such a book means you&#x27;re doing better than average; I&#x27;ve recently been fighting my way through an upgrade of a Rails 2.3 app to run under Rails 3.2; it&#x27;s a difficult enough task to begin with, and is massively complicated by the fact that no real documentation exists on how to perform such an upgrade. What&#x27;s there is mostly to be found on various Rails devs&#x27; Tumblrs, or in IRC logs or commit comments, and these are both poorly curated and evanescent; I&#x27;ve spent quite as much time trying to collate information on <i>how</i> to perform this project as I have actually editing code, and if not for the Internet Archive, a couple of critical Tumblr posts would no longer be available at all, thanks to the Rails dev who wrote them having apparently decided to &quot;reboot&quot; his blog.<p>The whole process has been enormously frustrating, not to mention slow; I started this project better than six months ago, as a novice Rails developer, and I&#x27;m just now getting to a point where I can see the light at the end of the tunnel. I am also strongly convinced that Rails is never the right solution; as long as I&#x27;m employed at this organization, it will embark upon a new Rails project only over my metaphorical smoking corpse. There&#x27;s just too much to go wrong, and the underlying ideas of the Rails community are too wrong-headed to make for a reliable platform; the purpose of a framework is to free the developer from having to rearchitect the same infrastructure over and over, yet Rails not only forces developers to do so during upgrades, but the massive changes to core functionality I mentioned earlier make the rearchitecting task enormously more complicated and painful than it&#x27;d be in the absence of any framework at all -- I do not engage in hyperbole when I say that I&#x27;ve led upgrades from PHP 4 to PHP 5 which were both less painful and more quickly completed than the task of upgrading a single, rather small, site, from Rails 2.3 to Rails 3.2 has been.<p>Rails, overall, is the worst example I&#x27;ve ever seen of the development model which Zawinski calls &quot;CADT&quot; [1]; between that, and the deep-seated and dangerous problems Shaw identifies with the Rails community as a whole [2], anyone other than a Rails core developer, who involves Rails in a project of any sort save perhaps a tiny single-developer throwaway prototype, is borrowing trouble on a potentially catastrophic scale both for himself and for any unwitting organization on which he chooses to inflict the resulting disaster.<p>[1] <a href=""http://www.jwz.org/doc/cadt.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.jwz.org/doc/cadt.html</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://harmful.cat-v.org/software/ruby/rails/is-a-ghetto"" rel=""nofollow"">http://harmful.cat-v.org/software/ruby/rails/is-a-ghetto</a>",1390846911

Even in the Crimea the self-identifying Russians don&#x27;t have 50% of the population.<p>* The Yes vote in 1991 for Ukrainian independence from the USSR: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Ukr_Referendum_1991.png"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Ukr_Referendum_1991.png</a><p>* 55% of ethnic Russians supported independence from Russia and they remember, are around 17% of the population.<p>* With the return of Crimean Tatars and Ukrainians from other parts of the USSR and withdrawal of Soviet troops if there was a confirming referendum today if anything the percentage would be bigger.<p>* Otherwise the culture is pretty much common to all Ukrainians.<p>* Religion isn&#x27;t that different - people actually self-identify as Christian or East Orthodox and the traditions are the same all over the country. Even the Greek-Catholics (10% of population) are really much more Orthodox than Catholic.",1390846715

The recent billion-dollar HSBC settlement is an example of a failure to properly monitor transactions, it is not clear that there was any criminal conspiracy involved [1]. That&#x27;s very different from this BitInstant charge: the operators are accused of knowing that one of their customers was reselling hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of BitCoin on SilkRoad where the transaction was anonymous, which means it can be used to launder money.

Linux probably has the best and easiest GPG integration. In general, encrypted mail is practically useless for every day communication and provides little real benefit. Unless you only communicate with linux experts, 90%+ of the people you&#x27;re talking to likely don&#x27;t even know what a &quot;MUA&quot; is. I use gpg for transferring sensitive data (passwords, api keys) occasionally to the rare few clients that have gpg, but the rest of our emails are still sent unencrypted. Why?<p>Encryption requires everyone in the thread to support it. Need to CC in the C-Level exec on something? Good luck getting them to setup it up in their outlook and use it properly. Even with my help, it took a good 30 mins to set my dad up with GPG on Windows/thunderbird. Have to figure out which software you need, the nomenclature for key generation etc is different in each program.<p>Encryption breaks search, at least in thunderbird. You can&#x27;t search through the encrypted messages and they aren&#x27;t indexed. This makes sense if you&#x27;re sending very sensitive data perhaps, but for general business correspondence it&#x27;s reduces productivity. There&#x27;s an open bug in EnigMail by a user who saves every email in plain text to use regular file search tools. That&#x27;s useless.<p>There&#x27;s the aforementioned webmail. Tons of people only use webmail, and there&#x27;s no way to interact with them. More importantly in my book, encryption breaks mobile access. Sure, there are addons for gpg on android, but I don&#x27;t trust my private key on my phone. In the near future there may be some way to use a yubikey with NFC for passing in the private key, but that brings in it&#x27;s own set of problems.<p>Lastly, it&#x27;s the cost/benefit that really keeps encryption use from being wide spread. It costs you time in getting each contact you use to use it, time dealing with being unable to search, time setting up your phone to securely access mail, unable to use webmail at all, and for all this you really only get two benefits: Prevention of e-mail interception by intelligence agencies or internet backbones and access to your mail by your e-mail provider. If I&#x27;m not concerned about these, just using proper TLS access for IMAP/SMTP prevents anyone I&#x27;m actually worried about (wifi interceptor, bad ISPs) from reading the mail. For mail inside an organization with their own mail server, mails are never anywhere unencrypted than company owned equipment, TLS in transit.<p>Doing encryption right is hard, for 99% of email the threat model just doesn&#x27;t justify the expense in time and headaches so the NSA doesn&#x27;t know there&#x27;s a conference call at 11am tomorrow or that you should call grandma tomorrow because it&#x27;s her birthday.",1390846236

I&#x27;ll try to get hold of a copy though. I am only really interpreting the above case on the basis of a brief summary and I suspect there were aggravating/extenuating circumstances in the case.<p>However, the law doesn&#x27;t operate in a vacuum. I suspect an employer is far more likely to lay claim to a piece of software which an employee claims was produced solely in his spare time than to lay claim to a house built by a carpenter it employs.<p>Further, for it to become a problem the employer has to become aware of the employee&#x27;s work in their spare time. I suspect many problems arise where an employee creates a useful tool in their spare time, then uses it in their day job. The employee then leaves, but wishes to revoke rights in the tool, whereupon the employer then asserts that it owns the tool in question.<p>If however, the carpenter produced house plans as part of their work, then produced a separate plan in their spare time, the employer could potentially lay claim to that plan on the basis of the above case. If the carpenter produced a house to those plans they would likely be protected by s.51 CDPA &#x27;88 (but then unregistered design right infringement becomes an issue) but the underlying infringement of the employer&#x27;s copyright would be still be an issue.<p>At the same time, the activities of the carpenter may breach other obligations in the employment contract, such as to not to be engaged by a third party whilst they are employed (this is of course irrelevant if for example the carpenter is constructing their own property to live in).<p>On your final point, an employee is not a consumer who has protections from unfair terms. If I as an employee are able to negotiate a remuneration package which reflects an assignment of all prior/future work then I can do so. As an employer I would have doubts as to whether such a transfer was possible/viable but that is not the same as saying it would not be enforceable.",1390845757

Remember, &quot;allegations&quot; are just that, and there is a gap between what the prosecutors might allege and what they can prove in court. The proof in this case is a slam dunk. It combines explicit support for BTCKing with explicit knowledge of his illegal activity. In HSBC&#x27;s case, that link is missing. You have emails like the one you quoted, which could be interpreted as wrongdoing, or could just be interpreted as figuring out how to let a client do what he wants in a legal way by dealing with a different office.",1390845737

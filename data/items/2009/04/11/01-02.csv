My customers don't feel ripped off about it, because their time is not.<p>The worry with SSL is the security implication (particularly for people who had no option to say ""Please treat my data as non-sensitive!  I totally don't mind!""), not the fact that the code is making an arbitrary distinction between user classes despite the cost to the company being the same for all users (essentially nothing at the margin).",1239415184

The restriction that if you loose/quit your job that you have to be out of the country in 60 days is bad for three reasons.<p>The first reason is that the employer knows his worker is dependent on him – he can thus get away with a lower salary, etc... The second reason it is bad is that you cannot quit and start a start-up – if you do not have a sponsoring company you must be out of the country in 60 days.<p>The third reason is that it deters people from going to the USA.

Interestingly, the funds only have to be appropriate for the business to be started, there is no set minimum like a lot of people assume (e.g. 100k). An example my lawyer gave me was a woman that wanted to start a horse riding school, and who got her E-2 by proving an investment of ~30k into her company.<p>I started an internet business, and my investment was in the same ballpark.<p>Also, for founders already living in the US, it is ok to work on setting up the business, e.g. incorporating etc, while applying for the E-2, as long as no customers are being engaged and money is being earned.<p>A downside is, that there is no straight path from the E-2 to a greencard; other then upping the investment (which has to come from abroad) to $10^6.<p>Edit: There is another downside, mentioned elsewhere in this thread. One has to be from a 'treaty' nation.<p>Disclaimer: I'd strongly advise you to consult an immigration lawyer if you want to do this.",1239412472

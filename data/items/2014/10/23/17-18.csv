We react to such bugs very promptly (as you can see in bug 1087963[0] which was fixed six hours after being filed) and, in many cases, can uplift patches from Nightly to Aurora and maybe Beta, so they&#x27;ll reach release builds more quickly.<p>If for some reason you&#x27;re not comfortable with filing a publicly visible bug, you can also abuse the flag for filing security-sensitive bugs. That way, we may be better able to help with issues affecting unannounced products.<p>For asking questions or getting our attention even more quickly, you can either join us in the #jsapi channel on irc.mozilla.org, send mail to dev.tech.js-engine[1], or send mail to one of the SpiderMonkey engineers directly.

I highly recommend volunteering for a couple weekends with a local homeless initiative (not trying to get on my holier-than-thou horse here, I&#x27;m as big of a selfish jerk as the rest of us). And not to sound like a student who just came back from a 3rd world missions trip, but it will completely change your perspective on life. Believe me, I&#x27;m the last to give up my precious free time but it&#x27;s almost fun, and incredibly educational.<p>In practice it&#x27;s extraordinarily hard to centralize the homeless. Like, proving P=NP hard. Consider the nature of the homeless, how they&#x27;ve been treated their whole lives, the way society talks and acts around them, etc. etc. They are not very willing to just hang around. To &quot;ghetto-ize&quot; the homeless would require mass sweeps by police to essentially arrest and forcibly move the homeless population. Yes, we always are in danger of marginalizing the people we&#x27;re trying to help but that&#x27;s going to be an easier job for a militarized government force, not a woefully underfunded and understaffed soup kitchen.",1414087030

The Vatican paid for a lot of that research and education. So I assume they got a lot of books they collects or had written that they want to made free access to the public by digitizing them.<p>A lot of people have left the Catholic Church to go to Non-Denominational Churches, or else just became Atheists. So passing the hat around doesn&#x27;t work as well as it used to.<p>Priests and Nuns take a vow of poverty, they are not spending the money on themselves. They use it for food panties, for homeless shelters, for healthcare, for education, and to pay their employees. A lot of times churches are in debt even if the people pledge to donate over a million dollars to the church, people don&#x27;t always donate what they pledge or promise and many families even with good paying jobs just don&#x27;t donate at all. There is nothing that forces people to donate 10% of their salary to a church, in fact most donate less than that. Some don&#x27;t donate anything at all.<p>The documents won&#x27;t rot away they are being taken care of and preserved. If there is not enough donations to digitize them, the world will have to go without them.<p>Just think this is a large collection of books from around the world that hasn&#x27;t been seen since the Library of Alexandria.

Not much.<p>That&#x27;s a broad brush.<p>> Hosting is so cheap that Atlantic will rent you a full-time virtual machine for $0.99/month.<p>If you&#x27;re serious about uptime/failover/any sort of SLA this figure is totally meaningless.<p>> A majority of Google&#x27;s headcount is ad sales reps.<p>Because they produce the revenue :)<p>> The main search engine, a few years ago, was developed and run by about 90 people<p>Their salaries are minuscule compared to the millions/billions it takes to keep the datacenters that serve search running. Not to mention that the 90 people figure doesn&#x27;t(can&#x27;t) include things like network engineers, hardware engineers, capacity, provisioning, monitoring, cloud infra, etc.  There are LOTS of supporting actors that aren&#x27;t directly on the &quot;search&quot; team.<p>This is the beauty of technology.  The size of the engineering team does not scale linearly with the size of the userbase. e.g. you can have a relatively small team of engineers write code that is used by billions of people.  In contrast, a sales team will scale linearly with revenue.  More sales people = more revenue, all other things being equal.

At best, evidence gathered by an undercover cop posing as a criminal can refute a character-based defense in a pre-existing case.<p>Since having and selling cocaine is (currently) illegal, any evidence gathered by that illegal act is tainted.  You can&#x27;t reasonably prosecute the person buying unless you also prosecute the person selling.  And that person is effectively immune.<p>The current lower standard in the courts--whereby the police can set up any situation, no matter how ridiculous, and entice a person to commit a crime that he might never have committed without that prompting--is an open invitation to police misconduct that may be more damaging than the crimes they are claiming to combat.<p>&quot;Hey, want some coke?&quot; <i>is</i> entrapment.  The state agent is encouraging people to commit new crimes for the express purpose of arresting and convicting them for it.  That isn&#x27;t fighting crime.

You may be showing that people in the area have motive and method to commit certain types of crimes, opportunity is still a significant barrier.  Traditional crime-fighting seeks to deny those opportunities rather that providing them.<p>This is why I find tactics like &quot;bait cars&quot; to be sleazy and indicative of lazy police work.<p>If you have mice, you can set out baited traps and be certain to catch some.  But it will not eradicate the infestation.  You have to clean your house, removing accessible food sources.  You have to eliminate places where the mice can hide and breed.

Ello&#x27;s actual computing cost is probably less than that.<p>Selling ads is expensive.  A majority of Google&#x27;s headcount is ad sales reps.  The main search engine, a few years ago, was developed and run by about 90 people, I was told by an ex-Google employee.  Google probably spends far more running the ad side of the business than the search side.<p>Craigslist has 40 employees, and they&#x27;ve been able to crush the newspaper classified advertising industry. They charge for a few categories of listings. That&#x27;s enough to keep them going.<p>At some point, users sense that there are too many ads.  Myspace went there when they had a revenue drop and tried to make up for it by increasing the ad density. Big mistake.  Myspace usage went into a screaming dive and never pulled out.<p>The big ad-supported web-based businesses are fighting Moore&#x27;s Law. What they do is getting cheaper, but their price, in terms of ad density, isn&#x27;t going down to match.  That makes them vulnerable. There&#x27;s hundreds of billions in market cap out there just waiting to be destroyed.",1414086690

It&#x27;s rare, but not unheard of, for people to entice the homeless into essentially handyman jobs with the promise of a meal, or payment, only to &quot;reconsider&quot; at the last second once the job is done. It&#x27;s rare, but not unheard of, for well meaning people to give out food that has gone bad, or can exacerbate terrible allergies or medical conditions.<p>I would hope that these behaviors are already illegal under current laws.<p>>Furthermore, encouraging the homeless to beg and subsist off of random passerby is an incredibly demeaning thing. It encourages the bad element of panhandling, begging, and lies to encourage donations. It creates an atmosphere where the most seriously poorly off end up being &quot;out begged&quot; by the devious looking to snag a quick meal, or beer money.<p>I agree we shouldn&#x27;t encourage this behavior. I disagree that we should make the behavior illegal.<p>>Last, but not least, it completely ruins standardized initiatives to solve the problem. The homeless are less likely to congregate in safe areas where organizations dedicated to help them are located. They&#x27;re less likely to receive a steady, nutritious diet. They&#x27;re less likely to be exposed to further job programs and mental health help. They&#x27;re more likely to sleep in an alley somewhere instead of, at worst, gathering near a shelter, or at best, getting a bed in a shelter where they are safest and most secure.<p>I&#x27;m inclined to suggest that if not &quot;making feeding homeless people illegal and strictly curtailing their movements&quot;  completely ruins the standardized initiatives, the standardized initiatives need a lot of work.<p>My big problem with forcing homeless into these safe areas by making things outside them illegal, is that you end up with &quot;out of sight, out of mind&quot;. These programs already don&#x27;t receive enough attention and support.",1414086660

For most of a week I stayed there, ate in soup kitchens and had a rather interesting look from the inside.<p>For the most part, in the shelter I was in, I saw two big categories of folks that were there:<p>- Folks that were crazy.  This included long term drug and alcohol addicts.  They were probably a slight majority.  The type and severity of crazy varied, but you got the sense that the goal with those types of folks was helping them to the extent possible, but in most cases, they were often going to need assistance for the remainder of their lives.<p>- Folks that were pretty darn normal, but had two things go particularly bad in their lives at once.  This group was pretty surprising for someone from a middle class background.  These people seemed totally normal to me.  There was one combination of events that was so common that I saw it several times -- people who&#x27;d lost their jobs and their wives (it was a men&#x27;s shelter) had kicked them out at the same time.  Some of these people had graduate degrees, reasonably respectable middle class careers, and so on ... but for one reason or another all at once they had no money and nowhere to live.<p>Neither of those cases would be especially well addressed by your proposal.  I&#x27;m skeptical that it would do anything other than make rich people feel better about complaining about the homeless, but really, that sounds like what it&#x27;s designed for.",1414086130

Therefore, the public has the right to regulate the negative externality that this activity creates -- needless physical harm to others. The regulation of this activity creates virtually zero new negative externalities and is therefore justified.<p>This is in contrast to the other behavioral regulations you mentioned  such as gay marriage, feeding the homeless, or even other drugs. The supposed negative externalities these activities produce have been viewed with more skepticism by the general public in recent years.<p>For example, the argument that gay marriage would somehow harm the way certain children were raised, has been mostly debunked. If sufficient evidence to the contrary would arise, evidence that was comparable to the quality of the evidence for second hand smoke, then the public would be justified in reevaluating the issue.<p>Fortunately, from a civil rights perspective, this is not the case.<p>In the case of non-smokable drugs you have to consider how much harm drug use causes vs. drug prohibition. It becomes clear that the negative externalities from the latter are much larger in scope and scale. Therefore, a conversation in ending drug prohibition is justified.<p>So, I would argue that whether or not a regulation on feeding the homeless is justified depends on the scope and scale of the negative externalities the activity creates, vs the scope and scale of negative externalities the regulation itself may or may not create.<p>[0] <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Externality"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Externality</a>",1414085636

8499450,comment,8494244,8496313,0,0,robomartin,,,"In order to understand this you have to take a deep dive into the sometimes-murky world of electronic component sourcing.  Even when buying from top tier distributors in the US there&#x27;s potential for getting less-than-wholesome product.  The legitimate product manufacturer would have no way of knowing who got what.  The best anyone can do is issue a notice like auto manufacturers do for recalls advising you that fake chips may have gotten into the system.<p>Now think about how you might react to that.<p>Externally the chips look exactly the same.  Depending on the nature of the organization you might choose to scrap your entire inventory or setup a testing system or.  In the case of larger scale production you could very well have 100,000 units of your product manufactured before you can even consider reacting to the news.<p>Once the product is in the market your choices are greatly reduced.  Scale is a huge factor.  We can send engineers to every single one of our installations to manually swap chips.  I did the math, it would probably cost somewhere in the order of five million dollars to do so (travel, time, tools, loss of business, etc.).  Well, we can&#x27;t do that.  Few businesses can burn cash like that.  And, of course, there&#x27;s the issue that we might waste millions of dollars swapping out good chips.  In this context it is far easier if devices with fake chips stop working and a normal process is used to fix them.  You remove liability and quickly identify the clones.<p>In consumer land things are different.  There is no sensible way to deal with 100,000 or 1,000,000 units of a product that may have some bad chips.  Yes, you probably don&#x27;t want those devices bricked on purpose.  However, if you are operating at that scale you are also responsible for ensuring that your supply chain is not shoving fake or out-of-spec parts into your products.  Easier said than done.  This isn&#x27;t the only fake electronic component made by crafty Chinese manufacturers.  In that regard this isn&#x27;t a revelation at all.",1414085200

Most of the time the people complaining about laws like these are (please forgive the stereotypes, but in my experience they&#x27;ve been accurate) white, upper class, white collar, with very little experience dealing with poverty or poverty related issues. They hear things that sound counter intuitive and the &quot;white savior&quot; complex goes into overdrive.<p>Since Orlando has weather (and an economy, look up 2008-present foreclosure rates in Central Florida for reference) that is very conducive to a large homeless population we have been dealing with the issue at a large scale for a long time, and a lot of caring, smart, experienced people all agree that there are very constructive ways of dealing with homelessness and very destructive ways of dealing with it. Time and time again, allowing the homeless to disperse geographically and survive in a &quot;free for all&quot; state creates enormous problems. You end up with exploitation, abuse, and harm to not only the homeless but those around them.<p>It&#x27;s rare, but not unheard of, for stupid kids to give the homeless sandwiches laced with, say, exlax. It&#x27;s rare, but not unheard of, for people to entice the homeless into essentially handyman jobs with the promise of a meal, or payment, only to &quot;reconsider&quot; at the last second once the job is done. It&#x27;s rare, but not unheard of, for well meaning people to give out food that has gone bad, or can exacerbate terrible allergies or medical conditions.<p>Furthermore, encouraging the homeless to beg and subsist off of random passerby is an incredibly demeaning thing. It encourages the bad element of panhandling, begging, and lies to encourage donations. It creates an atmosphere where the most seriously poorly off end up being &quot;out begged&quot; by the devious looking to snag a quick meal, or beer money.<p>Last, but not least, it completely ruins standardized initiatives to solve the problem. The homeless are less likely to congregate in safe areas where organizations dedicated to help them are located. They&#x27;re less likely to receive a steady, nutritious diet. They&#x27;re less likely to be exposed to further job programs and mental health help. They&#x27;re more likely to sleep in an alley somewhere instead of, at worst, gathering near a shelter, or at best, getting a bed in a shelter where they are safest and most secure. Keeping tabs on the homeless is one of the hardest things to do, but one of the most important. If you can&#x27;t track progress on a community or individual scale you can&#x27;t tell whether or not your efforts are working, and you can&#x27;t develop the personal relationships and support groups that time and time again are proven to be, overwhelmingly, the most effective way to get people out of the vicious cycle.<p>It&#x27;s hard to kind of shut off the automatic empathy that pops up, but you have to realize these are people just like you that ended up with a serious short stick in life. You need to treat them like that, instead of infantilizing them.",1414085145

This is very much an apprenticeship program for entrepreneurs. There are countless existing tech companies and IT shops full of ineffective leaders at different levels of an organization.<p>So, I&#x27;ve been thinking about the concept of applying an apprenticeship model to leadership skill development for leaders at all levels in technical organizations from startups to IT. Topics would include teaching and applying skill sets and frameworks related to understanding people styles, applying various leadership styles, trust building, collaboration, innovation, etc. And most important, the program would push for on-the-job application of learned skills with mentoring from masters with both technical and leadership experience.<p>What are you thoughts on the need of such a program for you or others in your organization?<p>Would you be interested in participating in such a program if it was available?<p>Have you seen anything else out there like this?",1414084991

Immigration laws violate a fundamental democratic principle, which is that laws should affect those who have a say in making them. Laws made by insiders that only affect outsiders _and_ govern that exact same insider/outsider status have no democratic legitimacy whatsoever.<p>Immigration laws are also a severe distortion of markets. They are the worst form of protectionism because they protect the (relatively) rich against having to compete against the poor.<p>However, for me, markets are tools and just as every other tool they are imperfect. They don&#x27;t replace goals or values, they are not equivalent to freedom, they represent but one particular freedom of many. Markets simply don&#x27;t cover everything it means to be human.<p>If markets fail to achieve one of my goals, then I will look for other tools to fix that. One of my fundamental values is that poverty is wrong in a world that is capable of providing food, shelter, education and healthcare for everyone.<p>Markets don&#x27;t fix that on their own, but in this particular case, more market would have helped those indian workers to protect themselves against a company that used immigration laws to exploit them.<p>(Another one of my convictions is that downvoting is a ridiculous way of having a debate)",1414084947

He also focused on policy regarding reimbursement of industry&#x27;s Independent Research and Development (IR&D) expenditures. Before working in the Pentagon, he directed the LBJ School&#x27;s master’s program in global policy studies from 2007–10.<p>Dr. Gholz works on innovation, defense management, and U.S. foreign policy.

His recent scholarship focuses on energy security. He previously taught at the University of Kentucky&#x27;s Patterson School of Diplomacy and International Commerce.

If a business truly errs and breaks the law unknowingly and is acting in an ethical manner then they should correct the action and make right the situation.  In this case no additional penalty, or a minimal fine would seem to be in accordance with the behavior.<p>If the business is on the other hand deliberately breaking the law and/or acting unethically then the penalty needs to be high enough that it offsets the potential profits/rewards so as to keep unethical businesses in check.<p>The problem is determining when is it an unintentional mistake, and when was it calculated?<p>In this case EFI is claiming it was an oversight/mistake, but that seems unlikely.

8499284,comment,8498782,8498782,0,0,netcan,,,"These are two giants in science fiction, in political philosophy and in pop culture. I&#x27;m a big fan of both. Great to read a discussion between them.<p>First, there&#x27;s the artistic stele of the books. 1984 has got this graphic novel, Noir feel to it, like Walking Dead or Sin City. Brave New World has this brightly colored surreal feel to it. It&#x27;s hard to compare books that are different in this way.<p>Overall, Orwell&#x27;s world felt more real to me, like it could have been brought about by real political circumstances. The system itself is evolved around the principle that whatever improves control survives. It feels like a political system that has devolved into its current state with the original vision or rhetoric of the ideology that brought it about remaining as a vestige, like Marxism in China.<p>Huxley&#x27;s world feels a little more fake to me. It&#x27;s like some political genius designed it head to tail and things went ahead as planned. It&#x27;s like Canberra (If you go there, you&#x27;ll see what I mean). That makes it feel more like a made up word to me, inorganic.<p>Orwell&#x27;s &quot;mechanisms,&quot; training society to gradually train their minds using language, euphemism, historical revisionism, social penalties for bad thought patterns and as much control over what people see & hear as possible… it feels real to me. We see that stuff at work now as Orwell saw it in his time. It feels possible, though I think Winston&#x27;s are inevitable too. Euphemisms to control thought is stronger today than it was in Orwell&#x27;s time.<p>Huxely&#x27;s mechanisms of Soma, infant conditioning and narco-hypnosis feel less real. I can&#x27;t count that against the author or the book though. Brave New World is distant future. That&#x27;s inevitably more fantastical and less realistic. I think he&#x27;s right though about using pleasantness over direct confrontation. Humans are pleasure seeking and denied pleasure, there will always be a force of instability.<p>The point where 1984 slips ahead though is the book-in-the-book &#x27;The Theory and Practice of Oligarchical Collectivism, by Emmanuel Goldstein.&#x27; In particular, it describes how the system must allow some non hereditary class movement. If the class system is too rigid, pressure builds up as talented individual press against the ceiling. If some are allowed to progress and there are prominent examples the class system becomes less explicit and more stable. I don&#x27;t know if it&#x27;s some of my earliest political exposure being socialist, but that just rings true to me. I see it today. Statistically, classes are fairly rigid, but individually, they are malleable.<p>I&#x27;m very biased though I think 1984 is one of the most important books I read as a teenager. It shaped how I saw things.",1414084067

By that time life has generaly done a pretty good job realigning young idealist thinking and opinions borne out of indoctrination.<p>Life experience is also a huge factor in this.  For example opposite poles are found in people who spent twenty years working a government job (can&#x27;t get fired, insane pension) vs. a bootstrapped entrepreneur (self reliance, responsible for own success and failure, no pension).  These people reach 40-something years of age with vastly different views of reality.

All of the government&#x27;s evidence claims Ulbricht ran Silk Road and he&#x27;s the person who ordered several assassinations. All they know is the person &quot;known as&quot; Dread Pirate Roberts did these things, so they need to tie DPR directly to Ulbricht.<p>Therefore, if the servers were searched illegally, then whatever was on those servers is important to Ulbricht, which means they&#x27;re important to DPR, which then the government can tie the two together and make the direct relationship between them. This means even if he wins the Silk Road case, the government have established him as DPR and then can formally charge him under the several indictments they have for the murder for hire scheme.<p>If he doesn&#x27;t challenge the search of the servers, and maintains since he&#x27;s not DPR, then he has no stake in the evidence on those servers, then all the evidence (fairly strong circumstantial evidence) would stand and the government will most likely get a conviction since even though they haven&#x27;t tied him directly to the DPR persona, all the evidence from the servers and other circumstantial evidence points directly to him. I say &quot;most likely&quot; but you never know for sure in these cases.<p>Contrary to what you believe, getting evidence thrown out in one case, actually solidifies the evidence in the other case. Also, it&#x27;s likely the government is preparing their case to be ready to charge Ulbrict depending on what happens in the SR trial. Since Grand Jury&#x27;s are a closed affair (defendants and their attorneys are not present) it&#x27;s a dry run for the prosecution to see how strong their case is. They could be sitting on additional information, or still in the process of collecting more evidence against Ulbricht, you never know. There&#x27;s a LOT we the general public won&#x27;t know about their case until they actual charge him and have to start providing the evidence they have.",1414083638

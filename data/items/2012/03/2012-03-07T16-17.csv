When it comes to visual design, things are supposed to look different. Twitter is meant to look different than Facebook and facebook should not look like Amazon. That's how you create mind-space . Bootstrap kills that - they all just look the same.<p>I can't remember name of one site that was made with Bootstrap. because there is nothing special,visually, to remember. No visual cue.<p>> Developers can focus on developing applications that are functional and usable, rather than tweaking CSS to make things ""look right"".<p>That's cool if you are building for just developers. But when it comes to non-devs, you don't want to confuse them, visually, with some other website. Remember, for many Facebook is a that ""blue"" site. With so many people taking bootstrap as it is, it's going to be... un-special.<p>I remember my friend discovering facebook themed Tumblr theme. People actually confused it with facebook and made comments like<p>""Why can't I update my status?""<p>""Who the hell are you and what are you doing on my fb?""<p>..<p>Also, the author is not saying Bootstrap is bad. In fact, it's good that you can focus on dev and have good defaults on CSS and design. But leaving it there is BAD. (read above, why). Take it forward.<p>Quick Fix: Don't use the Bootstrap top bar.

If the applicant claims 20 years of Java only experience, throwing in a few of those questions is just a sanity check for that claim, especially if that claim is one of the reasons you are hiring them.<p>A sportswriter who claimed an expertise in basketball wouldn't feel it unfair to be asked a few trivia questions in an interview.  If he didn't know how may winning seasons the Chicago Bulls had with Michael Jordan then maybe he isn't as expert in basketball as he claims.<p>Where these questions are unfair is when the applicant is more of a generalist.  They have worked on very diverse projects in multiple paradigms and multiple languages.  Their skill lies not in knowing how to use their tools, but in approaching new tools and quickly understanding how to use them.  If you are a Java shop and someone comes into the interview with little Java experience then asking questions about Java specific type enforcement is going to leave them a little flustered.<p>Cater the interview to the applicant, not necessarily to the position.

3676057,comment,3675195,3675195,10,0,trustfundbaby,,,"This story is a bit embarrassing to me, but I'll tell it anyway, I went for an interview a while ago, where I got asked a basic Javascript question ... problem is, I haven't actually written actual javascript in almost 3-4 years (not simple, but not really that hard either) ... I've been writing jQuery, which is supposed to be javascript, but I digress ...<p>I know how Javascript works, scoping, hoisting blah blah blah, but I haven't written a for loop, or used an actual getByTagName or whatever in a long long time ... I told the interviewer this, and they seemed cool with that, they asked me to write in pseudo code and I did that, then they asked me to convert it to javascript ... hunh?<p>Well, I started going through line by line and started doing just that, asking them to refresh my memory about the syntax of stuff, even how to write a for loop (yup, its amazing what spending years using jQuery.each or $.each will do to you :P). Anyway, we concluded and though I was annoyed at how out of practice I was, I thought I did okay.<p>Well the recruiter who set it up, called me back (very nicely I might add) and gave me the feedback on the interview. The interviewer, (who had been very nice to me too btw), had eviscerated me, writing that I displayed a lack of Javascript fundamentals ... saying I didn't even know how to write a for loop.<p>I don't blame them, because we clearly shouldn't have been talking in the first place, they were obviously looking for a hard core Javascript guy ... and not person who could just build complex front end UIs & interactions using backbone/ember/spine/jquery/whatever, which is what I was more interested in.<p>But it also got me thinking about how some engineers fixate on syntax, and use it in judging other programmers, and I realized that in some circumstances it is pretty appropriate.<p>For example, if you're looking for a specialized dev, then that kind of stuff probably does matter; in that, it can help you spot a star very quickly ... but I also think that over reliance on it could let you miss out on people who could easily specialize to the level you want, but might not have that immediate level of familiarity with the language. But when you have to go through 100's of candidates, is that something you're willing to take the time to look out for?

I cant imagine anyone with a degree being ignorant of the difference regardless of the programming language!</i><p>That's not what he's complaining about, though, he said that question was perfectly fair game. Because it <i>is</i> something that, as a Java programmer, you actually need to know to do your job. Similarly, the difference between the jQuery selectors <i>is</i> relevant, because those things actually do different things. I'd argue that even your joke example, ""What is protected inheritance in C++?"" is still relevant, if esoteric, because it's knowledge that could potentially be relevant to how code works and what it does.<p>You truly never need to know what package List or File is in, though, in the real world. If you're programming Java like 99% of the other people out there (i.e. you're not the type of masochist that thinks they can be productive in a boilerplate-heavy language like Java with nothing but a text editor), your IDE will fill in those blanks, and quite literally hide the import statements from you so you never need to think about them again (unless you mis-selected the class, in which case the fast solution is <i>still</i> not to remember the actual package name, but to delete the offending import statement and ""Optimize imports"" again, this time picking more carefully rather than mindlessly selecting the first one in the list...).<p>That said, most Java experienced programmers would probably know that stuff like List is somewhere in java.util, and stuff like File is going to be in java.io, just from having auto-completed them so many times, so it could be a very weak filter against people that are lying about their experience. But I still don't think it's a useful question, at all - if they get it right, it <i>very weakly</i> confirms that they're not lying, and if they get it wrong it's nothing more than a minor eyebrow-raiser, suggesting that possibly they've exaggerated their familiarity (though again, any practicing Java programmer could be very good but still be weak at the ""Name That Package!"" game, because it's 100% irrelevant to the job).

3675966,comment,3675047,3675047,97,0,tobtoh,,,"I really loved playing SWG - not so much for the game, but for the business aspects of it. Whilst not as successful as the OP, I made thousands of $US from the game by being part of a oligopoly.<p>One of the game mechanics was the concept of buffs - basically chemical stimulants your character could consume to temporarily boost critical stats which aided in combat. They were an essential item in PvP (player vs player) combat if you wanted to have that edge and so were in high demand. Buffs could only be made by the doctor class and only by the top level doctors. Another critical game mechanic was that the quality of the buff affected how much of a boost you could receive to your stats, and the quality of the buffs was affected by the quality of the raw materials you sourced to make the buff (every resource had a variety of stats - this game was a real minmax-ers delight). The highest quality buffs were the only one that people were interested in buying.<p>Most of the resources required for the buffs were reasonably easy to find - but there was one which was rare - avian meat. The highest quality avian meat, harvested by killing particular birds, only appeared (real-time) once a month for a few days. Without this avian meat, you could not produce the highest quality buffs.<p>The first time I made buffs - I happened to time it during the HQ (high quality) avian meat period. I spent hours killing the birds to collect meat. I made my buffs, had a shop near Coronet (the main trading city in the game) and sold out within a few days. And I noticed that all the doctors sold out within days too - and that the last few that had some stock could request extortion prices for their stock. That gave me an idea <p>The next month when the avian meat spawned, I parked my character in the main spaceport and keyed up a macro (the game had an in-game macro system). All my macro did was cause my character to shout out every minute Buying avian meat @ Z credits/piece - sell to my vendor at coords X,Y. I basically bankrupted myself buying up as much avian meat as I could whilst it was available.<p>I made up a batch of buffs and started selling them - I ran out after 20 days - but I was now substantially more wealthy! I figured - heck Im on a good thing - lets do that the next month. Of course, no good thing goes unnoticed <p>The next month, there were three other doctors in the spaceport shouting out that they were buying avian meat. Well this simply would not do! So I basically upped the price I was offering to purchase avian meat above theirs - heck - I was flush with funds from last month so I figured I could out buy them. It turns out I was right - I was able to purchase even more avian meat than the last month and I was able to produce enough HQ buffs to just last the month. Then the third month - this is when the market dynamics got interesting <p>By now, several people had noticed that avian meat was in hot demand once a month. In the third month, there were several shouters when the HQ avian meat started spawning. Like last month, I upped the price I was willing to offer to price them out of the market - a bidding war erupted, but with my bankroll, I could outbid anyone (although I was cringing how fast I was going through my credits). Like any market, with the prices rising so quick, it changed behaviours - suddenly many of the hunters in the game were out killing birds to collect meat. I effectively had my own contractor workforce out hunting avian meat!<p>By the end of the third HQ avian meat season, I had more meat than I ever had before. I realised I almost had complete control of the buff market on my server so I changed my selling tactics. I made my batch of buffs and started selling them, but I jacked the price up (100% increase) - this time I wanted to be able to continuously sell my buffs to last the full month. Other buff sellers kept selling them at the going rate  so I did the rounds of the cities each night and bought up any HQ buffs which were under my price and added them to my stockpile. By the end of the first week, I was bankrupt although I had a huge stockpile of HQ buffs - but most importantly, virtually every buff vendor was empty  except mine. I jacked my price up even further and did a roaring trade.<p>Over the next few cycles I cemented my reputation as one of the few reliable buff vendors who could consistently offer the highest quality buffs month-round. With the constant trade and monopoly prices, I was able to further entrench my dominant position each month by continuing to out bid any other doctor who tried to purchase avian meat. There were two other doctors on the server who managed to offer buffs for most of the month, and whilst I never talked to them, I noticed that they never went below whatever price I set. Our little oligopoly had a total lock on the buff market - it was a golden age!<p>When I quit the game a couple of months later, I had millions in credits which I sold for a few thousand $US. SWG let me play out my monopolistic capitalistic fantasies - how I loved that game :D",1331137477

I've heard a number of programs that make lots of small files in /tmp will benefit from this, but ideally the disk cache would suffice.<p>This still means that an encrypted swap is a good idea.  Either that or don't even have it as a separate partition, since some point in linux 2.6 series of kernels it got to be very efficient at using a file as swap.  This means that you've only got one set of keys to manage, and it's much easier to setup (in fact it's likely supported by nearly every distro that supports encrypted root filesystems out of the box).<p>I personally like to name my swap files /WIN386.SWP",1331137299
3675953,story,,,13,9,jjanyan,"Ask HN: Review my startup, n3rds",,"http://n3rds.com/<p>A friend and I were recently laid off and started job hunting. After a couple days of looking on all the job boards, we both had complaints with them.<p>1) Searching for jobs by skills was often flawed. If someone posted a link that ended with .php, it would show up even though the job had nothing to do with someone developing using php.
2) When we'd find a job we liked, we often didn't know if our expectations for salaries would meet theirs. This led to wasted conversations and time.
3) It can be time consuming searching all the job boards. Yes, there are aggregators, but we didn't want to miss a job if an aggregator missed that particular job board.<p>On top of that, we had some other thoughts about job searching in general:<p>1) If you look for a job while employed, you run the risk of exposing your search to your current employer. Either by updating your resume on LinkedIn (or other job site) or talking to the wrong recruiter (who might have a good relationship with your current employer).
2) While employed, it'd be nice to know what's available in the market without spending effort. Unfortunately, job boards require on-going effort of searching, at least weekly. Instead, we wanted to have jobs matching our skills and other requirements sent to us as they became available.<p>So we built n3rds so that users set up their location and radius, if they want remote, skills, and salary. The user's info is kept private. When a recruiter posts a job, we ask a similar set of questions. We then match users to jobs and notify the user if there's a match. If a user is interested in the position, they click a button to make their information available to the recruiter so they can contact you.<p>We're interested in any feedback or questions.

INTO ITEMS; available to them <i>and the manual labor was winning</i>.<p>There were many folks who said that there were solid commercial reasons for this refusal at the time.  A lot of them boiled down to ""I don't know about those crazy Asians but sophisticated American consumers don't want to do this thing that we're spending thousands of man-hours a month unsuccessfully trying to prevent Americans from doing.""  Those have been pretty decisively proven wrong since a) when AAA US MMORPGs experiment with item sales they make serious bank and b) the Free2Play model empirically has worked very, very well in the US, especially when you compare the revenue per user and in aggregate against the HUGE premium embedded in development costs of the AAA subscription RPGs.<p>Oh, also, Zynga ROFLstomped the entire industry.  (10~50% of the revenues of the most successful MMORPGs for 2~3% of the development costs of the median AAA MMORPG... and they did it more times in a three year period than there have been successful AAA MMORPGs in history.)",1331136710

3675891,comment,3675047,3675047,44,0,Skywing,,,"I was 14 years old when Galaxies was first announced, two years prior to its release. Like the author of this article, I too was crazy excited about this game when I first heard about it. My friends and I did all the same things that the author said he did, such as fantasizing about being a bounty hunter, or chillin' with Luke, etc. The idea of the game excited me more than actually wanting to play it, though. I've never been much of a gamer but games were how I learned to program. So, my approach to Galaxies took me to similar places as the author, but I got there a different way.<p>When Galaxies was announced, I was in my peak of reverse engineering Blizzard games. I had been reverse engineering the Battle.net client protocol since Diablo 1 and StarCraft. Battle.net had a community full of people who reverse engineered the Blizzard games and there was somewhat of a competition as to who could write the coolest bots, as we called them. Bots were apps that emulated the official clients and could completely sign into Battle.net without using the actual game. Most of mine were just console apps, because I enjoyed the reverse engineering more than the coding.<p>So, when Galaxies finally came out in beta, a friend of mine luckily got a copy. The computer that I used at that time, which was a shared family computer, was terrible so I didn't expect to play the game, but I did ask him for a copy of the game's directory so that I could start writing Galaxies bots. I focused all of my time on reverse engineering the Galaxies client protocol. I would stay up until the sun came up, staring at the game in a debugger. When a family member need to computer or I had to go to school, I'd hit print on IDA and print out an entire dll - tons of paper. I'd basically annotate the printed out assembly with what I thought was happening and then I'd get home and confirm or deny it with the debugger at run-time. I'd borrow my friends account so that I could see the sign in process in real-time and get packet dumps. I did this for months straight and it never got old.<p>The end result was a console application that could emulate the official client and sign in to Galaxies, select your character and respond to various events. My friends would level up new character's professions and I'd run them on my terrible computer while we were at school, and over night. I could run many at once with no problem.<p>While we did not have the in-game success with making tons of money, I did save a lot of money up front on a lot of new computers and tons of copies of Galaxies. :)",1331136260

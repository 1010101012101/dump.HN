8037570,comment,8036360,8036360,1,0,fzltrp,,,"The original point of patents is to provide protection to inventors and give them a head start in implementing their inventions. A company which hold patents without implementing them is basically not following the spirit of the law. Hence, there should be a drastic &quot;countdown&quot; to a patent viability, which would be dispelled by a producing a viable, marketed application of that patent. I would suggest a 6 months timeframe, non renewable. For software patents, given the very abstract nature of the invention, 3 months should be enough, and the patent lifetime itself should not exceed 3 years - 12 times the countdown to market (3 years is already quite long in the software industry, although not in the law one). This should be retroactive. Note that I&#x27;d rather see the concept of software patents completely invalidated, but I understand that the issue is quite complex.<p>Oh, and what should be done in the case of patent transfers? Should the new holder be subjected to that countdown as well? What if the products tied to a patent is eol&#x27;ed? Should the countdown be restarted? I do think so. It&#x27;s all about the practical side of things.",1405443434

The reason manufacturing ceramics for pressurized reactors is hard is the pressure and size involved.  LFTR can be run at normal pressure at small scale; you can use a kiln as the pressure vessel if you want to.<p>Also, no, not any metal gets brittle; inconel and hastelloy handle radiation quite well for decades at a time, as does good old fashioned nickel.  Beyond that, most reactor pressure vessels are a layer of metal then a layer of something that&#x27;s really good at radiation, then the real pressure vessel, so that the interior layer&#x27;s brittleness isn&#x27;t very important.<p>We built and ran LFTRs commercially in the 1950s in New York State and Pennsylvania, before computers became a commercially realistic thing.  They provided our grandparents no significant technical challenge.<p>The <i>actual</i> big problem with LFTR is primarily regulatory.  The design hasn&#x27;t been vetted to modern safety standards, which costs hundreds of millions of dollars, and the entities who are nuclear-aware and have that kind of money to throw around tend to be the existing nuclear companies, who can&#x27;t switch to any other technology because they&#x27;re deep in the Gilette Razor model, and anything that took out their existing fuel contracts would immediately bankrupt them.<p>There is /zero/ materials science needed to make a LFTR.

They&#x27;d use this to market their expensive products. The researchers generally had a long leash so long as they were (a) looking at software that customers might care about and (b) were actually finding things.<p>What Google seems to be doing is starting a lab like that, but without the hooks into products and marketing; instead: Google has cash, wants to retain security researchers, and so will throw money at a vulnerability lab run for the common good, partially for the PR win, partially for the knock-on benefits to Google of having lots of good security people, and yes, partially for the good of humanity.<p>(FWIW: I worked at what I think was the industry&#x27;s first vulnerability lab, at SNI, which eventually became McAfee&#x27;s vulnerability team).",1405443140

This &quot;shortage&quot; is absolutely a self-inflicted wound, an outcome of all those things I described above.

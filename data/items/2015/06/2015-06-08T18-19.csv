9681354,comment,9677863,9679797,0,0,rthomas6,,,"See here&#x27;s the thing. Happiness is a state of mind, not a physical mode of being. Many people, including you, think that a person needs some parity with an invisible standard in order to feel contentment. But that&#x27;s not true. You don&#x27;t need anyone&#x27;s permission to have fun, and you don&#x27;t need to obtain anything to start enjoying your life.<p>A few centuries ago, when you say people could have fun doing nothing at all, what you call &quot;a great deal of suffering&quot; in contemporary society is actually materially <i>better</i> than even the middle class lived back then. Much better. It&#x27;s just that people are wired to compare themselves to their community, and by default that&#x27;s what people base their self-worth and contentment on, unless they do some careful introspection and consciously change their source of sense of self-esteem.<p>A few centuries ago, the average family lived on a small farm with little education, no running water, no electricity, and little excess. A large fraction of the children would die before their first birthday, and dying of bacterial infection was quite likely at any age. The boys could expect nothing more than a life full of hard physical work on the farm, and the girls could expect to get married or, if they were very lucky, get a profession like nursing or teaching. Yet, this average family was <i>happy</i>, and it wasn&#x27;t because of their material possessions or adequate healthcare (clearly). It was because they were grateful for what they had, and because of a supportive community who were just like them and were always there for them.<p>You&#x27;re missing the point of the quote you pasted. His father had everything he ever wanted because he didn&#x27;t value material wealth, and was perfectly content with what I imagine you (and probably me too) would call &quot;suffering&quot;, because he had friends, family, hobbies, time, and relatively good health. That&#x27;s really all we need.",1433789663
9681353,comment,9680988,9681264,0,0,amyjess,,,"> I wonder why the Linux distros are so slow to adapt to tablets.<p>Tight hardware integration. Most tablets have locked-down bootloaders that make it difficult to replace the default OS.<p>You&#x27;ve also pretty much got to start over when it comes to drivers. Linux used to have <i>terrible</i> driver support back in the day -- I remember carefully choosing motherboards and laptops because I wanted a Linux-compatible chipset -- those days are over on the desktop (except for a few esoteric peripherals), but it&#x27;s going to hit hard on mobile. Imagine booting your tablet onto Linux but not being able to use the GPS or some other piece of connectivity.<p>And then, you&#x27;ve got to take all your established GUI code and throw it in the trash and start over. Nothing from the desktop world is going to be usable in a touch environment. The big desktop environments all have heritage going back to the late &#x27;90s. You can still see some KDE 1 and GNOME 1 layouts used in their modern KDE Applications and GNOME 3 descendants, and the stuff that was replaced was replaced one app at a time. Throwing everything out and starting over is harder than it looks.<p>But, still, we&#x27;ve got some attempts at this. Look at Ubuntu Touch, Sailfish, and Plasma Active, for example. In the past, we had Maemo 5, which was amazing, and it was everything I wanted in a touch-based Linux distro, but the only company that had pockets deep enough to fund its development turned away from the platform, and the closest thing it has to a successor (Sailfish) has been a disappointment. Also, even that required the distro developer be an established hardware manufacturer: Maemo 5 couldn&#x27;t have worked if it was just an OS that could only be installed on third-party devices.",1433789660

They do not send these patients to a 10-day retreat, where they are not allowed to talk, must surrender to a master, do extreme meditation techniques for hours on end, till they self-operated on their psyche enough it&#x27;s broken and they now have to repair it.<p>What salvation is for Christians, is enlightenment for Vipassana.<p>There are frauds out there who use these techniques to ensnare students, and there are students out there who ensnare themselves through being young, naive and gullible. Since the experiences are so dramatic, you get a host of uncritical people who proselytize Vipassana. Kinda like people who buy expensive Apple products will be lauding Apple, since else their investment was bad, and no one wants to admit to that. The people for who it didn&#x27;t work remain quiet, especially when the master told them it was their own fault.<p>Vipassana for prolonged times can do much more than reading a book or eating breakfast. What if the author had gotten a psychotic episode during his tripping balls? Would that be dismissed with another fancy foreign term or garbled psychological babble? Would a master be able to spot deteriorating mental health in their patients? People report disassociation, hallucinations and hearing voices. To a qualified mental health professional that would not be scientific evidence of cognitive benefits, that would be a manifestation of latent schizophrenia. Then there are the documented suicides and self-harm... but then again, people have probably died from eating bad breakfast too.<p>Meditation-induced psychosis: <a href=""http://www.karger.com/Article/Abstract/108125"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.karger.com/Article/Abstract/108125</a><p>Panic attacks and depressed episodes:

All programs essentially created to do something with objects of the real world or model existing world in some way. And that is where the complexity comes from. As we go higher up the stack of abstractions and tools, some things get easier, but the problems and tasks remain complex just like the world behind them. Performance gains we get come from the fact that many of the modeling and decision making has been done &quot;at the level below&quot; so we can shift into making higher level decisions.<p>Just imagine a &quot;magic AI&quot; which can create any program for you simply based on your description. For any non-trivial program which does not previously exist you would need to specify so many details that your list of requirements essentially becomes a program (in DSL). The more &quot;defaults&quot; and existing pieces you can use, the easier your job will be.<p>So, following that logic, the programmer of the future would be using some sort of AI for sure, to take care of the parts of the system which can be reused and recombined (taking care of the common details). And that means that anybody who can <i>describe</i> what they want will be able &quot;to program&quot;. But for new problems, it would need to go into deeper down the stack and domain knowledge to be able to build new things.<p>In terms of &quot;what you need to know&quot; it means having domain knowledge so you can describe what you want. And for new domains - being able to dive deep and learn them, which means the more basic stuff you know (math, statistics, algorithms, whatever), the more efficient you will be in learning and ultimately building.",1433789347

For some people there is a brief success (reduced tumor size, sometimes to undetectable levels) but, outside of some cancers which are very treatable, this is normally a brief pause.<p>Treatments people receive today are because of the experiences of people in the past which showed a good response and this is fed into developing and fine-tuning what is done today.

9681189,comment,9677758,9677758,0,0,muraiki,,,"&quot;To me this is one methodological weakness of type theory, the commitment of having types for all terms in the language. Why is that? Types are designed to facilitate composition, but the natural unit for program composition is not the term but the function, or even the module.  It makes sense to assign types to modules — it is methodologically consistent. But how we calculate these types could conceivably be more flexible, allowing a global perspective within the unit of composition. Types, as properties at the interface could be calculated using the entire arsenal of (decidable!) logics and static analyses.&quot;<p>I admit to not being that familiar with type theory (I&#x27;ve done a little Scala but most of my FP experience is in Clojure) but when I read this my gut reaction was: &quot;Isn&#x27;t that kind of what Go is doing?&quot;<p>Meaning that in Go, the focus of compositionality isn&#x27;t on basic types and the functions that act on them (see Go&#x27;s lack of generics) but rather the focus is on getting different modules to agree on &quot;what should be done to some stuff&quot; using interfaces. This is putting interaction first but also getting compositionality in a &quot;generic&quot; way given that interfaces in Go are implemented implicitly.",1433788553

E.g. channel x is used for input while channel y does only  output.<p>- What kind of data is exchanged on the channel? E.g. x is used to exchange a boolean, while y exchanges pairs, the first component of which is a double, and the second component is a channel name which is used for inputing a string.<p>- How often is a channel used? E.g. x is linear (used exactly once), y is affine (used at most once) while z can be used an arbitrary number of times.<p>This setup has been investigated from many angles, and one of the most beautiful results in this space is that normal types known from lambda-calculus (e.g. function space) can be recovered <i>precisely</i> as special cases of such interaction types, using Milner&#x27;s well-known  encoding of functional computation as interaction.",1433787789

Cut a cable, or take out a large networks, the internet will route around it, either quickly (routes converging on a new peer) or slowly (a poorly connected network finding a new upstream to purchase connectivity through).  That companies then build on top of this and implement services where they are the middle of both connections does not change this fundamentally, it just adds an optional layer.  To assume our connections have upstream bandwidth that is never or rarely used is false.  I would argue that we generate more content per-person than ever  in history.  The seer amount of pictures, videos, webcams, posts and comments is much higher than ever before.  Are they hosting it directly from their connections?  Usually not, but that&#x27;s as much a case of being efficient and reaching an audience as it is in companies wanting control over the data.  Even then, there are services which are decentralized from that, such as email.  It&#x27;s not efficient to host content yourself.  Even the large networks use dedicated CDNs.  For the end user, Facebook is a CDN.<p>That said, I agree there is a clear move towards our data and services being handled by fewer, and larger entities, such as Google, Yahoo, Microsoft, Apple, Amazon.  But they aren&#x27;t a single entity, and I don&#x27;t consider that centralized.

and in many cases, it seems to me that we&#x27;re headed for<p><pre><code>    5. Re-discovering the old social ideals actually had reasons
       and that rather than discarding them and replacing
       them wholesale we&#x27;d have been a lot better off
       tweaking them.

There&#x27;s a lot of places where we&#x27;re doing this. Some of them still have too many people in #2 to make it politic to name all of them, but when you look at our society through this lens a <i>lot</i> of stuff suddenly makes more sense. We&#x27;ll see how this theory&#x27;s predictive power pans out.<p>(And to be clear, in step 5, a lot of our ideals <i>do</i> need tweaking; that&#x27;s not a rhetorical concession, but a core part of the process. But I&#x27;d submit we&#x27;ve thrown out far more baby with the bathwater than almost anybody in modern times is any longer equipped to understand.)",1433786928

When I ask them if they&#x27;ve tried anything else besides that one thing they&#x27;ve been doing over and over for a decade, perhaps a side project, a toy product, some contribution to OSS in the new paradigm they apparently really want to work in, I get responses along the lines of &quot;I&#x27;d never work on something I&#x27;m not being paid for, I&#x27;m a serious professional that&#x27;s irresponsible&quot;.<p>Er.. ok.

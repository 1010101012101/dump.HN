Tracker codifies the Agile process (more or less following XP principles) way better than any other PM tool I've ever seen.<p>The tool itself won't make your team more or less productive, though. You really have to understand and be committed to Agile/XP theories, processes and practices for it to work. Tracker can help guide you in that direction ... but like almost any tool, there is a ""best"" way to use it to get the full benefit.",1226552113

362696,comment,362691,362691,0,0,jbyers,,,"This is a strong set of questions.  The only one that didn't ring true was #8, ownership.  For a two-founder company, I strongly believe that 50/50 is the correct structure.  Anything less breeds long-term ill will.<p>What if, as Gabor notes, contributions are unequal?  For early stage startups and minor disparities, I'd say skip it and still go with 50/50.  The amount of future contribution (and potential for conflict) by both parties will be huge compared to than what's already been done.  If someone really is coming to the table with a vastly larger contribution to the company, and intends to bring on a co-founder, I'd challenge the pair to very carefully consider whether the second person is a founder or a highly compensated key employee.",1226550882

I can even lower the quality a bit and drastically shrink the jpg size with the quality drop still being barely noticeable if at all.<p>For most other stuff (things created from vectors for instance) pngs often look better and are smaller.<p>To me using a png for a photo (which you see often) is a lot like using a wav file for an audiobook, it's just overkill.

Far from it, and IMO the degree to which it has become a religion is disturbing. I suspect that might be the source of the downmods.<p>I've seen projects with more tests than code, and I think that shows a problem with development methodologies. Simply reasoning about the flow through the code (and possibly using a powerful type system [think Ocaml] to help catch errors at compile time) would remove the need for many of these tests (<i>not</i> all tests should go, of course) <i>and</i> would result in tighter code.",1226549310

What circumstances are different between ice cube trays and ice cream mixture?  High surface area comes to mind.  In the article the experiments described all involve volumes of water (or ice cream goo) that are in containers with low surface area to volume.  SA and Volume do not scale linearly, thus the heat exchange rate would be faster for the ice cube trays.  Of course, TRYING it out would not hurt.  Several hundred years worth of scientists seem to have laughed at previous experimental results out of some egotistical belief that experimental results passed down from history are fairy tales.",1226549145

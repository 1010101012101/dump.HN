In this he seems, and perhaps was, very unreasonable; but I think, only in being angry at my failure.

(The &quot;Belt&quot; is the queue machine model revisited. I can&#x27;t see a theoretical breakthrough here). But the Mill&#x27;s realization that combines a queue model with VLIW and embedded spiller machinery is worth attention.<p>Some criticism however: no sign yet of how variable latencies in memory will be tolerated. Requiring fixed latency for FUs is problematic with cache misses and FU sharing between pipelines. Also his comparison between a 64-item belt and the 300+ registers of OoOE is unfair, since the 300+ registers will likely tolerate more latency than the smaller belt.<p>I wrote a review of what I get from his first two talks here: <a href=""http://staff.science.uva.nl/~poss/posts/2013/08/01/mill-cpu/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://staff.science.uva.nl/~poss/posts/2013/08/01/mill-cpu/</a>",1375349694

Thanks for the feedbacks so far!
Sure, I cannot talk about full features but maybe i can tell some so i will discuss with my colleagues.
We will be out in few weeks time
I am very practical so i was looking for practical solutions. It is not just post your idea for fun
But it is a practical solution that goes all the way.
I think (not yet sure) that we got it and i have some patents on the flow.
Looking to discuss with potential audience to learn what will actually work well.
We work very hard to make it easy and also deal with the legal aspects of engagements.
I want to make it easy for users (it means that we are doing most of the messy stuff) The goal is for you to meet real partners for small projects, sign real contracts and start working.
Who says the best guys live next door? Who says you cant build an app or gadget with great experts on the net ?<p>Please Let me know more
Best

If your government tries to say what you can or can not eat, for example, you need complex law to figure out what is cheese and how big the holes in it must be. If you can eat whatever you like and the government couldn&#x27;t care less, you do not need any of that. So tell me - do we really need a law specifying which size holes in the cheese must be?",1375347986

That&#x27;d make it pretty ideal for angular discrimination based on phase difference.",1375347903

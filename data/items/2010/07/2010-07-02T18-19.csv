1481990,comment,1481551,1481685,0,0,jpdugan,,,"These are all valid points, but I think you're overstating the case a bit.  Certainly, IP creation should not be routinely outsourced, but it can be outsourced in limited cases to the benefit of the organization.<p>I think there's a common misperception that outsourcing firms charge higher rates because their resources are (supposedly) more technically proficient.  But, at least at my company, this is rarely what's going on.  Most of my clients have excellent technical staffs.  Our clients hire us in part, of course, because we are talented technologists, but the larger part, I believe, is because of our ability to acquire domain knowledge rapidly and our ability to retain that knowledge over long stretches of time when we aren't actively involved in the development process.  Finding a comparable resource to hire or contract is so onerous that it doesn't make sense when what the company really needs is to achieve a goal now.<p>In other words, any product development company worth a damn hires as much for business acumen as it does for technical acumen.  Otherwise, what would be the point?",1278097116

(http://taketake.com)<p>I can't seem to nail that design - that feeling I'm looking for. We've changed the UI and the design roughly 5 times now. 6 months ago I stumbled on the Lean Startup philosophy; the launch early, scrappy and iterate doing customer development. I kept telling myself that I will launch in a few weeks so it was too late to ""start from scratch"" and apply the Lean Startup idea. But it's been 6 months now and I can't seem to get out of this stupid cycle of me being unhappy and wanting to have everything perfect before I launch.<p>Because of this, other startups like Blippy, Swipely (and gdgt to some extent) beat me to the push. My reaction when I saw this was to try harder and build features they don't have - so that when I launch our site we would one-up them.<p>Now I feel like I was wrong. I should have launched months ago and done more customer development to make sure I'm not building something people won't care about.<p>Somehow it is so difficult for me to release something that is not perfect. I can hear Gary V. telling me to ""quit the bitch train"" and launch already.<p>At this point I have three competitors; gdgt, Blippy and Swipely. They've got big launches with lots of PR attention and now getting traction while I'm losing my time pixel by pixel.<p>I guess I'm scared of failing and don't want to launch because of that - or I'm trying to pull a Steve Jobs with the resources of a non-VC backed startup.<p>Should I just take my time and release when I'm happy about my product and not care about my competitors getting traction - or should I hurry to get in the market to get my piece of the pie asap?<p>Your thoughts are appreciated :)",1278096658

The biggest problem in subsistence farming is the risk you take.

Yes, it requires hard physical labor, but beyond that, it's not at all difficult on a small scale.<p>You want to have a small garden? Find a bit of land and prepare about 3'x3' of it:  Dig it up, turn the soil over and make sure it isn't too sandy (add mulch if it is) or clayey (add sand if it is). If the area regularly gets flooded, then build a small wall around it and fill with dirt so you have a 3x3' raised bed that will drain properly.<p>Then plant one row each of squash, potatoes (for the experiment you can just cut an eye out of a potato you would eat and plant it) and tomato seeds. Potatoes go about 3"" deep, squash and tomatoes about 1/2"" deep. If you're in the Northern US you might need to use tomato plants instead of seeds since it's already July.<p>If you want to, you can build a no-effort compost heap next to it: just dump your organic kitchen waste in a pile next to the garden. At the end of the growing season, work the pile into the soil and it will get more fertile every year.<p>Check daily to make sure the soil doesn't get too dry (water in the evening) and pull any weeds you see. Don't do any more than this and you'll be eating squash, tomatoes and potatoes in three months. With a plot only 3'x3' it will take only a few minutes a day. It's that easy.",1278096303

I think this is partly because the term MVC has been distorted considerably from its original meaning when used in the context of web sites.<p>The key thing about real MVC is to separate not just the I/O details from the model, but the input details from the output. The view's only purpose is to render data from the model to some output device so the user can see it (or otherwise detect it). No matter how many monads you use to dress this up, it is fundamentally effectful: it updates the screen, plays sounds through speakers, etc.<p>This is where the confusion with web-based ""MVC"" comes in. If all your view does is generate some HTML as pure data, it isn't much of a view at all. No-one can see the results. You need a web server sitting on top, to take that HTML and send it back to the browser client using HTTP, and in the traditional sense of MVC that would be part of the view code as well.<p>This may be a useful distinction, in that it provides separation between the (necessarily impure) outside-facing code and the (potentially pure) rendering operation. A view module can be built up in layers from submodules just like any other part of a software system, and likewise the top layers can be effectful while depending only on pure code below. But the view module as a whole is always effectful, or it serves no purpose.",1278095320

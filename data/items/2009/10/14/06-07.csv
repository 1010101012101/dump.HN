The traditional means of sanitation are emphatically <i>not</i> fine. I don't just think that, I <i>know</i> that is true. Half of our increased life expectancy comes from better hygiene and sanitation. Have you ever been to India? Let me tell you, it literally <i>stinks</i> there. However, not investing in western sanitation doesn't make them fools, because proper sanitation is really costly and the <i>perceived</i> benefits are small. It's entirely understandable they'd rather spend the money another way.<p>How you can turn this into some cultural superiority issue is beyond me. You know, India really <i>is</i> behind the West in terms of things like prosperity and  life expectancy. That has nothing to do with making you feel good: it's a plain fact.",1255503152

They announced that they had measurements which were not explainable by the prevailing theories, and the new theory it suggested would be hugely valuable. Some journalists made it seem even more exciting than that, but I don't think you can blame scientists for the way they are reported in the popular press any more than you can blame politicians for what's reported on Fox News. Of course, it turned out that their numbers were better explained by some subtle measurement errors, but it took hundreds of chemists years to convincingly refute the theory.<p>It was not an unreasonable decision to announce it publicly, in order to mobilize the resources necessary to get to the bottom of it.",1255502955

Therefore, this is a horrible news article, with an assumption that Dropbox holds an new ownership stake in the domain.<p>Second, it's actually quite possible Dropbox asked the .com holders to forward traffic to the real site in order for both parties to value the domain's contribution to downloads/upsales from type-in traffic (is it 90% new users?  Or almost always those who have an account?). This would mean TechCrunch hurts Dropbox by increasing their cost to buy/license the domain.<p>Third, we can't tell who owns the domain, so it could still be the same party!  The .com could forward to the real site for just one day to tease Dropbox by sending it visitors for just one day.

The struggles in defining such terms with so little to work off of is one of the reasons why we haven't quite launched yet, but that's simply an indicator as to the magnitude and seriousness we treat the issue (and, really, the /main/ reason's lack of an agreed upon site design... and, er, lack of content backlog to start off with.

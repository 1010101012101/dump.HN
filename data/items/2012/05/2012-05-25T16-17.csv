4024369,comment,4023320,4023320,11,0,jws,,,"Congratulations! You have written completely non-terrifying C code. This would not inspire any sense of dread in me if I had to go in and look for a problem, so I will.<p>Comments I see you have alarmed the HN crowd, but I was reading the annotated page and it makes sense in that context. As a data point, I only looked at the lefthand column paragraphs about twice, related to the quarantine handling in the forever loop. There is an odd effect if children are dying faster than the quarantine period, but I convinced myself that there was a finite number of children and they would eventually get quarantined if they kept that up allowing the period to finally expire. I looked at the titles though.<p>Design  I'd lose the fixed size string buffers in the child_t. 256 sounds like a lot for a command until someone uses a wildcard in a directory. strdup() and free() are your friends here. I see you have a centralized free function for the child_t and are using valgrind. I trust you will not leak or shoot off a body part.<p>Portability  You are using ""%m"" to get the strerror(errno) into your log messages. This is a GNU libc extension. I don't have a pure BSD machine around, but it doesn't work on OS X. This will likely also crop up for very small Linux systems that use alternative C libraries for space reasons, such as OpenWRT.<p>strncmp() and the strnXXX() functions in general  These are not really what you want. Think of them as functions for fixed length string fields with optional NUL terminators. Then never use them.<p>Consider<p><pre><code>  strncmp(""foo"", ""foobar"", 3)
</code></pre>
It returns 0, that means equal. That is seldom what you actually intended. In your case, strcmp() is fine because you are working with guaranteed NUL terminated strings.<p>I see a strnlen()<p><pre><code>  inline bool str_not_empty(char *str) {  
    return strnlen(str, 1) == 1;
  }
</code></pre>
Most C programmers would rather see<p><pre><code>  inline bool str_not_empty(char *str) {  
    return *str != 0;
  }
</code></pre>
 but they'd also leave off the ""inline"" and use ""int"" instead of bool. ""inline"" is the compiler's problem, let it take care of that. The part you might do for performance is to mark the argument as ""const"" since you aren't going to change it. That gives the optimizer more freedom around the calls, though in this case the optimizer will probably inline it and it won't matter. ""const"" is also a nice hint to people reading your code.<p>I suppose summing up strings, ""char *"" is not an opaque type to C programmers.<p>Signals and file descriptors across forks Signals are generally a bit tricky, and what to do with open file descriptors across a fork is also fussy. I'll leave that to you. (Frequently in cases like this, closing all file descriptors is the right answer. A shame there isn't a portable way to do that. Remember you might have something open from the syslog functions.)",1337965039

Tools that seem to be massively monolithic are extremely helpful in solving problems and do them far too well to do them away.<p>Every time I hear why some programming language is better than Perl, I always see some Utopian dreams being displayed as the only thing that every matters to a programmer and nothing else. In reality there are many competing demands a programmer has. And providing them all generally leads to 'Swiss Army Knife' kind of designs. Because you are trying to provide many things in a package(That is the demand and the requirement at the first place). That sort of design might not be text book elegant, but it is extremely helpful in the real world.<p>There fore the 'beauty' and 'utility' design goals don't often match. This is the unfortunate problem every programmer to face sooner or later. A programmer has to abide by time, budget and some metric of quality every time.<p>Alas many of those demands don't lead to goals which may require an elegant design.<p>In early days of Unix, Lisp programmers used to call the <i>problems</i> Perl programmers solve, itself as stupid. Telling the user why his needs are invalid isn't a nice way to sell things.",1337964644

I am a pretty good judge of people, and I liked him very much. He hasn't figured out how I can get money to him in Belarus yet, but he's willing to work anyway, because of his complete trust that I'll pay him.<p>His time logs have always looked a little inflated, however, and lately they are more so. Further, I recently noticed an error in his time logs so large that it clearly shows sloppiness, at best, on his part. Certain time entries not possible because I didn't even give him the specs for that work until a few days later. (And for various reasons, I know he didn't simply record the wrong day.)<p>I am willing to cut him some slack because he's from a different culture, he's in his early 20s, and I am his first moonlighting client. I am inclined to attribute these problems to his youth and inexperience, and perhaps aspects of Belarusian culture, rather than malice or deceit. Also, his role in the project at this point is so crucial that firing him would be a crippling loss. That said, I am only willing to work with someone I can trust -- so we need to clear this up ASAP.<p>Have any of you been through a similar situation? Do you have advice about how to handle it?<p>I just discovered this a few minutes ago and have not said anything to him yet. I'd like our mutual trust to go up, rather than down, as a result of our conversation about this topic.",1337963926

If you look at the comment threads below this one, many are asking questions like, ""I want to start a website, should I worry about this?"" to which the replies are, ""yes, hire a lawyer"".  That's good advice in this legal climate, but it slows progress tremendously.<p>If someone just wants to share their weekend project, they're out a few hours and ten bucks a month to host the thing.  But they're exposing them to potentially hundreds of thousands of dollars in legal liabilities; perhaps they miss some takedown notes while they are away on vacation.  That's a pricey lawsuit should someone be inclined to pursue it.  (And there's no indication that rightsholders won't.)  The initial legal consultation regarding a site you want to launch is not cheap either -- an hour with a lawyer buys you a year of Amazon EC2 CPU time.<p>The end result is that people that want to share their programming work won't because they decide it's too legally risky.  Sites like The Chilling Effect Clearinghouse let us see what sort of takedown notices are currently popular and plan our services accordingly.  If that happens to discourage rightsholders from enforcing their rights, well, that's fine with me.  I want to see new ways of using the Internet, even if it comes at the expensive of the big copyright holders.<p>As for removing spam from search results; that's actually a warming effect.

All they need to do is create an ""uncensored"" all-spam-site web index and offer that to the wider Internet community.  The people that want to search spam sites will then be able to, creating value and a new business model.  (Look at how successful DuckDuckGo has been, and all they do is wrap Bing's results.  A new index could be amazingly successful.)",1337962322

Now this is an interesting perspective, I am deaf as well - and I have a bilateral cochlear implant.  Now I have been working in the IT industry for over 16 years as a developer, infrastructure support guy and more.   I have worked for companies such as IBM, Shell Oil Company which of course required alot of interaction.  One thing though we the deaf individual have to be proactive and we can't be reactive.  Most of the time the hearing counterparts really do not know what we can or can't do.  Unless we become a bit more assertive.  Now but one thing I am a bit puzzled, you indicate you don't want to be a part of the deaf community - but what about organizations and individuals who are part of HLAA?  Hearing Loss Association which is really more geared to ""oral"" deaf individuals but not necessarily in an ASL format.  I am not really understanding this part.  I am very involved in the deaf community, as well interact with people from HLAA and as well part of the hearing community.  But I have to be proactive to make things happen.  And don't look as one or two people from the deaf community and think they ALL are like that because they aren't.  It would be like everyone reading your article right now and thinking all of us are like you - but we aren't.  I chose NOT to think in a negative light and think positively.  It is a tiring job but it is the only way we can educate our peers otherwise we get lost in the limelight.  And honestly society nowadays are much more sensitive and understanding about people with disabilities than in the past.  I admire your passion to really get out there - and admire the fact that you wrote an article on this.  But the same time - think positively life is too short!  :)  And also - the talk about getting with a deaf or hard of hearing girl and having deaf/hoh babies is unrealistic.  It has to come from the genes (like mine - my parents are deaf) but if you because deaf because of sickness or something else and if you hook up with a deaf/hoh lady who also became deaf because they were sick or non-genetic reasons your chances of having deaf babies are VERY VERY slim.  I have seen so many CODA (Children of Deaf Adults) who have succeeded well in life - my kids who are CODA - all three of them are in Honors Program (and they all three are hearing) and their first language was ASL.

The Dragon capsule can be 6 tons. Even neophyte nuclear weapon designers could probably make a device that is less than 6 tons. What is worse is the company won't just die a horrible death if our government pulls all of its contracts.<p>So where does that leave us? In a very very interesting spot. We are approaching a point where orbital launch technology will be available to 'everyone' and we have to deal with everyone having it.

direct democracy, because in effect, that's what it advocates.<p>People who deeply care about the law are already able, and willing, to find the information they
need; I'm all for making it easier to manage, and there are worthy projects in that respect, but by
no means do I want <i>ordinary citizens</i> to start dabbling in legislation. The Founding Fathers'
romantic notions notwithstanding, running a government that provides important services to 350
million people isn't a side-jobit's a full-time job, and arguably a career. Heaping disdain on career
politicians is absurd: if they're good at their job, of course they should make a career out of it.<p>Which brings me to the idea underlying all these posts: that by keeping close tabs on the intricate
details of lawmaking, we can ensure that they will do a good job. I have heard this argument before.
It came from this guy who wasn't really a coder, but wanted to keep close tabs on what the coders
that worked for him did. So he started asking them to log in all their hours, with messages
explaining what they were doing. And he started looking at the commits in the VCS so that he would
see the actual code. Of course, when he didn't like something he would criticize. He would threaten
people with getting fired if they didn't code according to his standards. The coders tried to
explain that sometimes things have to be done in a way that's different from the ""common sense"" way,
and sometimes he was even reasonable about it, but he still was not a coder, so <i>he had no way of
knowing what was involved.</i><p>That's who we're trying to become with projects like these. The most pointy-haired of pointy haired
bosses. Our pointy hair wants points of its own, and all because we try to hold people accountable.
That's a canard.<p>We want to hold politians accountable because we feel they are irresponsible. But what about our
responsibility? Who hired these irresponsible politicians to steward us? We did. Instead of looking
for ways to make politicians accountable, let's look for ways to make ourselves responsible. I would
start, on an individual basis, by taking ownership of our part of the equation: our vote. Remember:<p>""Accountability is something that is left when responsibility is subtracted"" -- Pasi Sahlberg<p>Let's find projects that restore our responsibility. From that, the rest will follow.",1337961808

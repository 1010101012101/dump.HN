He was faced with the choice of following something which was (to him) new and outlandish, or taking a safe ""bet to nothing"" (on the SEO company) for a fixed sum of cash.

I even admit that sometimes this makes me anxious (because the normal career path is not open to me), but on the other hand, I simply realize that a 9 to 5 office job is not for me, and I have to look for alternatives.

A couple of weeks in, suddenly the company policy would change and people were expected to be in the office by 9am.

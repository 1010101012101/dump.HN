For example, in Austria where I live, it doesn&#x27;t matter how the evidence was obtained.<p>In Austria, if someone illegally spies on you, the information they collect can be freely used in court. It is not important where the evidence comes from, it is only important if the evidence is credible or not.<p>This doesn&#x27;t mean that the police can do whatever they want; if they torture someone, a potential confession would be worthless because it wouldn&#x27;t be credible. And if the police used illegal means, that would bring about a separate trial (in theory).<p>But courts in Austria never have to pretend that some evidence doesn&#x27;t exist.",1375613854

I&#x27;ve read numerous case studies supporting this and heard personal accounts.<p>For example, a friend of mine was molested by her uncle between an age of 7 to 11 years old. The thing that sexually arouses her the most, but also creates in her the strongest feelings of guilt and revulsion after orgasm, is the thought of children of that age being sexually abused by middle-aged men. Except that in her fantasies, the children are actually enjoying and wanting it.<p>Child sexual abuse can imprint the abusee for life.",1375613727

I came back to discover he had passed away (aged 26) and the last message he sent was to me along with an image of him in hospital. He had made arrangements with his family and we had access to all his accounts, including email, and the photo itself was still on his phone. So the message wasn&#x27;t lost forever. But what if he hadn&#x27;t?<p>After that, I decided to never delete anything unless I confirm it&#x27;s of no further use.<p>In fact, every message I&#x27;ve ever received, except for spam, has been backed up on a local server, my laptop and the desktop as well as external USB(4) for the last 2 years or so.<p>I doubt something like that will happen again, but some things don&#x27;t feel trivial though still intangible.

6155222,comment,6152103,6152447,7,0,IsaacL,,,"Great quote from George Leonard&#x27;s <i>Mastery</i>:<p>&quot;In his book Zen Mind, Beginners Mind, Zen master Shunryu Suzuki approaches the question of fast and slow learners in terms of horses. In our scriptures, it is said that there are four kinds of horses: excellent ones, good ones, poor ones, and bad ones. The best horse will run slow and fast, right and left, at the drivers will, before it sees the shadow of the whip; the second will run as well as the first one, just before the whip reaches its skin; the third one will run when it feels pain on its body; the fourth will run after the pain penetrates to the marrow of its bones. You can imagine how difficult it is for the fourth one to learn to run.<p>When we hear this story, almost all of us want to be the best horse. If it is impossible to be the best one, we want to be the second best. But this is a mistake, Master Suzuki says. When you learn too easily, youre tempted not to work hard, not to penetrate to the marrow of a practice.<p>If you study calligraphy, you will find that those who are not so clever usually become the best calligraphers. Those who are very clever with their hands often encounter great difficulty after they have reached a certain stage. This is also true in art, and in life. The best horse, according to Suzuki, may be the worst horse. And the worst horse can be the best, for if it perseveres, it will have learned whatever it is practicing all the way to the marrow of its bones.&quot;<p>(Shameless self-plug - I wrote a blog post about this a while ago: <a href=""http://i.saac.me/post/lurning-cearves/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://i.saac.me/post/lurning-cearves/</a>)",1375612576

6155196,comment,6154278,6154525,1,0,cnvogel,,,"In principle this could be mitigated with a suitably programmed IOMMU which can limit the operations that a DMA capable device (e.g. on the other side of the Thunderbolt connector) can do with your main memory.<p>Traditionally they are used when you have an operating system running in a virtual machine, but you want (for whatever reason) give it hardware access to a PCI card. Without the IOMMU, the virtual machine could program, e.g. a network card to read/write to memory that belongs to the host operating systems, hence breaking free of the virtualization jail.<p>But, as far as I know, it was also possible to limit DMA in firewire controllers. Was that implemented in practice? I don&#x27;t know. So will it be done for Thunderbolt-Enabled computers?",1375610976

I wasn&#x27;t exactly asking about child pornography prosecution (which quite frankly, I know nothing about and am probably the least qualified person on Earth to have an opinion about), but about its automatic mention every time &quot;online crimes&quot; are mentioned.<p>I mean, I&#x27;ve been practically living online for too many years, stumbled upon some dark corners of the web and I can honestly say that I never came across CP (I mean inadvertently. I never actually targeted anything like that, so I don&#x27;t know how easy it is to find if you actually want to. And I wish I could try it out to validate my claims, but the whole paranoia about the subject makes me afraid of having &quot;underage porn images&quot; in my search history).<p>My point is that if you listen to politicians, you&#x27;d think that the Web is ridden with kids exploited for porn. I can think of so many crimes I come across quasi-daily on the web: Credit card fraud, identity theft, copyright infringement, banking scams, stalking, harassment, ... I suspect, although I don&#x27;t have the data to back it up, that these are more prevalent by several orders of magnitude, yet in our collective mind: &quot;online crime == child pornography&quot;.<p>I honestly didn&#x27;t mean to start a debate whether we should or should not prosecute offenders and how. I just find it weird that we mention it so much, and the slightly paranoid conspiracy-theory-loving voice in my head can&#x27;t help but think that someone is spreading deliberate FUD by amplifying actual events.",1375610872

Contrast recognition on the skyline/cityscape image to delete the light-polluted sky I can&#x27;t imagine  would be too hard, a bit of math could tell you where in the world this sky would be in the next few hours to filter an image database search (provided the images had location and time data), and combining the two would be relatively simple. The biggest part I can&#x27;t get around is maintaining the shot angle so it&#x27;s EXACTLY the same sky. The image database, too, would have to be pretty extensive.",1375610694

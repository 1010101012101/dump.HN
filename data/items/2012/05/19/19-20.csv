(at larger intersections, of course this is not the case everywhere) In most countries (all?) it's illegal to do a u-turn when there's a double line between lanes and usually they're painted a fair distance before intersections to prevent people from overtaking when they're close to lights / stop signs / intersecions which they may not see yet. On a bike you're really unlikely to get to a legal distance from an intersection and come back in time for the same green light.<p>Also it's confusing pedestrians crossing the street - you expect vehicles coming from one side or the other, not suddenly appearing on your left, because they did a u-turn right after they passed the crossing.",1337457560

One reason I can think of would be laying out columns on reports, on terminals that didn't support proportional fonts.<p>A lot of people rail against tabs; most of the time, these are people who don't understand them or have never tried to use them.<p>You see this debate about tabs vs. spaces in code all the time, and I've yet to hear any valid argument about why spaces are better (at least in any modern context).  But there is an obvious reason that tabs are better: It's much easier to line things up, keep them aligned across different users' fonts, and realign them if you change the text to cross a tab.",1337457384
3996881,comment,3996557,3996794,7,0,WiseWeasel,,,"Personally, I think a lot of the contention stems from the huge number of 4-way stop intersections in the US. Coming to a complete stop and starting again is rough on a car engine, and especially rough on a bike rider, who must lose and rebuild all that momentum with his own strength. Also, a bike rider starting from a complete start will go through the intersection much more slowly than car traffic, causing an obstruction to traffic flow.<p>Other countries use roundabouts, and while that's not necessarily the answer, there might be other remedies. California is famous for the ""California Stop"", where you come to a near stop and roll forward slowly for a few seconds while you wait your turn, which if done systematically, is an option which seems relatively safe and conserving of momentum.<p>As a rider, I try to time my arrival at an intersection to share the turn of a car going in the same direction and slip through without coming to a stop if I can.",1337457349

3996811,comment,3996537,3996537,9,0,socratic,,,"Is there a better signal than high-pay for choosing a technical internship?  Looking at Alexey's list, with the exception of hedge funds, Google, Facebook, Twitter, Dropbox would be my top choices for where to do a technical internship, and they're also the highest paying.  I suspect this is because a good engineering culture leads to engineers that cost more and get better equipment which eventually filters down to interns.  (Obviously, there are exceptions, though.)<p>More broadly, is interning at a startup a good place to learn technical skills (rather than marketing, networking, funding, etc.)?  Most of the information on running common web stacks, for example (nginx, rails, django, node.js, varnish, postgres, mysql, redis, etc.), is either freely available on the web or even can be bought as a service (heroku, app engine, aws).  By contrast, the only way to find out how engineers have solved problems (web serving, analytics, etc.) at truly huge scale (e.g., 10+% of the human population) is to actually see the solutions at a big company (though sometimes companies will publish details of 3+ year old infrastructure).  Big companies also tend to have stricter code review cultures, while small companies tend to just need code written now.  All of this seems to point to learning significantly more at a (technically excellent) big company, even though the ""output"" of the intern might appear to be less.<p>In fact, doing a startup seems like it might be more like resume stuffing than working at Google or Facebook these days.  Working at a small startup, you get to talk about your impact, how you built a mission critical piece of infrastructure, whereas at a big company you're probably only trusted to write some small features that are not in the critical path of full time engineers.  What's more, you get to say that you worked at a startup, which everyone pretty much respects around California, even if the startup dies or wasn't very technically interesting.  But the potential for learning quality engineering through code review and understanding the existing infrastructure seems a lot higher at the big company.",1337456299

When I used laptops from other providers, chargers - including cabling - lasted for years without any substantial wear - it was common to retire a laptop but the whole charger was still working as new. For Apple ones, it's definitely not the case. Cables are very weak and new L-design laptop connector is worse than old T-design and breaks twice as fast in my experience.

3996747,comment,3996171,3996661,4,0,its_so_on,,,"I agree with the gist of your post, however I must say that in my experience Apple products are manufactured to a standard that is 170% that of competitor's (really, just put a Macbook next to a Dell, or an iPhone next to a Blackberry and pore over the differences).  On the features, I would say that roughly 75% more features are accessible to a casual user: you can simply do more without even thinking about it.  However, to the professional user, only 15% of the features are available. (!)  A professional user who got a degree in this subject can simply do literally six and a half times as many things on an Android or on a Linux desktop than with an iPhone or Mac OS X.<p>On pricing, I don't have any figures but do not consider it out of line to consider an Apple product as being a durable replacement for several cheap plastic versions.  An investment in OS X in the guise of a $1800 MacBook Pro could easily take the place of a $700, a $500 and a $600 laptop bought over the same period of time.  By the end of the period the specs of the MacBook would be severely out of date, however in other respects its usage may be preferable to the usage of the new $600 laptop.  If you are not comparing on this basis, Apple products may be up to 300% as expensive as their competition, again as shown by the laptop example.<p><i>These numbers are scientific, have high statistical confidence, and good to eighteen decimal places.  I show them with only one or two significant figures, however the full figures are going through a process of peer review and should appear soon in the IEEE Spectrum.  Or not...</i>",1337455033

3996730,comment,3996332,3996626,3,0,ac,,,"GHC is a bit of a pathological case, which doesn't make it less valid. I wouldn't really dare to estimate how much refactoring you need to do if you change, say, one constructor of GenStgExpr, primarily, because I don't know the GHC codebase. In my work I have had instances when I had to change datatypes drastically and refactor the code accordingly. I'd say, in all cases the type system was helpful -- I just go to every error location (very easy with, e.g., ghc-mod), and it's invariably a pattern-matching case, so I fix a bit of code here and there (20 LoCs at most) and it all worked. But the thing is, of course, if you change your datatypes all the time even these kind of small changes will soon become tedious. But then if one programs in Haskell in a hacking mode (""meh, let's try throwing this thing in, maybe it will miraculously start working"") -- it just won't work. Haskell requires one to think well, before programming -- that's why I love it. I think, in the end it saves time.\nAnother problem might be that the datatype you are refactoring is fundamental to your program and is used in most modules -- I think it's just short-sighted design. GHC, for example, has several different program representations (Haskell, STG, Core, maybe some others), so a change to one representation would only affect a part of the compilation pipeline (namely, the translation to and from that rep and the associated optimisations/analyses). But if you really need such a fundamental mega-type that will change during the lifetime of the program, why not write an easier to manage interface to it? Either use the record syntax or write setter/getter functions by hand. Just $ my $0.02 where my=id",1337454587

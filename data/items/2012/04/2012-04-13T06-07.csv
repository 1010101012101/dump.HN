The post-VC, private equity market makes the most sense, but as you noted, the amount of money you can raise that way pre-JOBS act is far too low, making companies like mine (Pixar for live-action filmmaking) either at the mercy/generosity of a Steve Jobs-like figure (literally), or simply not funded at all since we exist in the Government-created financial no-mans land. Either is far from ideal.<p>The JOBS act, at least for our company, changes this and makes a previously non-viable-through-inadvertent-regulation company suddenly viable. That's why I supported it, and continue to do so.",1334300283

People who got into MIT/Ivy Leagues/etc but decided not to go to college vs people who did go to the elites. Would finally stop people from doing the extraordinarily frustrating dual quotation of ""going to college matters, they studied people who didn't go to college and people who did and those who did make way more money"" + ""but which college you go to doesn't matter, they studied people who got into ivies and went to state schools vs people who went to ivies and there was no difference!""<p>In the first case you're using two separate populations, and in the second you're not. Assholes.<p>EDIT: Actually fascinating that they found 191 schools with negative ROI using their ranking system. Suggests that the school really <i>does</i> matter - getting a simple degree isn't what differentiates you anymore, it really is where you get it from. Or perhaps those students just can't match par with the 75th percentile of high school grads, as that was their ranking criteria.",1334300187

Return on investment should be looking at treatment effects only.<p>For example, it may be that science minded people have higher salaries in general, and those people also tend to apply to technical schools. In that case, the real ROI is from being technically minded, not from attending a school that focuses on that.<p>A better test would be looking at kids that got into both Harvey Mudd and MIT and separating them into populations based on where each kid decided to matriculate. That way you're factoring out the admissions bias.<p>Malcolm Gladwell wrote an article in the New Yorker about the difference between state schools and Ivy League schools that actually looked at treatment effects.

It's a natural extension of physical laws combined with the circumstances of our evolution as a system--in this case linked directly to our basest subconscious instincts.

They don't know how the individual math chapters interact together with a larger whole. If they knew how it interacted with a larger whole they wouldn't ask ""When will I ever use math?"".<p>Here's what Russel Ackoff professor of systems sciences had to say about it<p><a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdBiXbuD1h4"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UdBiXbuD1h4</a> (3 parts)<p>Analytical thinking allows you to analyze the system at hand in a way that let you describe its behavior, its structure; it allows you to answer the how? question. Yet, it never helps you answering the why? question.<p>So, we [Ackoff and his colleagues] had to develop a new way of thinking;  the systemic thinking [,or sometimes its called synthesis]<p>Synthesis, or systems thinking, allows you to truly understand the system and answer the why? question. Actually, it also has 3 steps (the same numbers of step for the traditional  analysis), and each single step is interestingly quite the opposite to the corresponding step in analysis!<p>Traditional Analysis<p>1. You take the thing you want to understand apart.<p>2. You explain the behavior of each part taken separately.<p>3. You explain the behavior of the containing whole. So if were trying to explain a university, we have to first explain the education system of which the university is a part.<p>Synthesis (or Systems Thinking)<p>1. You take the thing you want to understand as a part of a larger whole.<p>2. You aggregate your explanation of the parts into an understanding of the whole.<p>3. You dis-aggregate the understanding of the whole into an understanding of the parts, so that we explain by identifying their role or function of a system in the larger system which its a part.  And the explanation of a behavior of a system lies in its role or function in the larger system of which its a part.<p>Example - You go to a business school and you look at the course structure. You study marketing as a separate subject, finance as a seprate subject, production as a seperate subject. The net result is at the end of the business school you have no understanding of what a business is and not even the understanding of its parts. You can't study production independently without understanding how it interacts with marketing, finance, personnel, product and so on",1334298345

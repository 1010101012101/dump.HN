10788541,comment,10787614,10787614,0,0,joveian,,,"One thing I would love to have that could be a solution to the worst case early boot encryption issues is an external crypto processor that generates and stores long term keys, implements authentication, and only releases temporary keys to the main system (to which it only connects via a simple serial connection).  It has enough of a screen and input to receive a password and query the user before performing various actions.  That is, something like Bitcoin Trezor but maybe a little more complex input and for more general crypto use.  Ideally, such a device could even physically store the trusted stick (or several), although that trusted stick shouldn&#x27;t interact with the rest of the system differently than any other device for maximum reliability.  This way the most sensitive crypto is not performed on a general purpose system and the user could authenticate to the device once and then the device can authenticate the user and provide keys to multiple independent systems without hastle.  It is an additional expense so hopefully wouldn&#x27;t be necessary, but would be one way to solve the early boot encryption problem (if needed and less expensive solutions do not work) in a not completely special purpose way.",1450972791

But it was a 2015 Star Wars movie by JJ Abrams instead of a 1977 Star Wars movie by the director of THX-1138. The First Order was more organic, more believable than the sterile, efficient sci-fi bad guys of the Empire. Kylo Ren&#x27;s temper tantrums wouldn&#x27;t have fit into George Lucas&#x27;s Star Wars universe, but it added depth to his character. It gave him a weakness. It humanized him.<p>Another case in point: motion control cameras and Steadicam were cutting edge filmmaking when A New Hope was filmed (I think Steadicam was only used for the speederbike sequence in RTJ). Shaky hand-held cameras are a JJ Abrams trademark.<p>I love the new diversity to the Stormtroopers. Hopefully it&#x27;ll draw more die-hard fans from all walks of life into the family.

10788475,comment,10786481,10787834,0,0,fundamental,,,"My understanding from reading a few &#x27;adversarial example&#x27; papers is that it&#x27;s also possible to talk about the classifier as having a poor margin between classes. An acceptable output classifier for the convolutional net would be to place the decision boundary arbitrarily close to the known examples, but this doesn&#x27;t make much sense given how large the semantic differences actually are.<p>There are multiple options to try to enhance the distance to the decision boundary (such as the adversarial examples referenced in the post), but I think the recent work from microsoft (I think it&#x27;s published Dec 2015) on replacing pooling layers in the convolutional neural net with something analogous random forests might be the best option so far. More or less each decision tree will end up pushing values to 0/1 in the non-linear region, which mitigates some of the concern about overly linear systems and it places the decision boundary at a somewhat arbitrary location between classes. In aggregate when these locations are combined the resulting classifier has a larger margin without explicitly needing adversaries. So instead of sampling the image space, you&#x27;re effectively sampling the classifier space.<p>If you want, I can dig up the citation, but searching for deep neural nets and random forests should get you to the paper all the same.",1450971863

The number of parents personally familiar with the scientific evidence and qualified to make an independent judgement is probably tiny.<p>This then leads to the argument that non-experts should respect the scientific consensus, but then how does a non-expert evaluate the credentials of a commentator to determine whether they are in fact an expert and part of a real scientific consensus? Bad science abounds in the media, and there is a lot of money to be made from peddling it, and some of the people presenting it are very convincing because that&#x27;s what they do.<p>This is a fundamental problem with any debate about policy based on scientific merit: at some stage, there is always a degree of trust involved for anyone who is not personally an expert in the subject matter, which in practice means almost everyone. This opens a gap for the critics and sceptics. And crucially, <i>this is a legitimate concern</i>.

I would go further and say all financial responsibility as well. Either we are a society that entrust parents to raise their children or we let the state raise them.<p>What you propose is legislating the greater body for the unsavory actions of a minority while it is becoming more common with more and more federalization of law it always conflicts with personal freedoms and leads to a less free society for all. Someone would find an action that you do at some point in your life, unsavory and illogical and quite possibly harmful to yourself or others, under what you propose we could just enact legislation for the greater good. This runs contrary to the spirit of the law of the land and ends up somewhere closer to fascism. Please note I am not implying that you are advocating fascism but taking away peoples choice to self determination even for their children certainly starts to lay the foundation for a very different society.<p>What you propose is a slippery slope on the path to the state raising children which in my opinion is a far scarier reality. Life involves risk, and sometimes it involves risk for children. I think it is fair to say if one has made a life choice that puts other kids at risk their kid cannot participate in activities that could place other kids at risk but it is a whole different level to mandate that we start making medical decisions for parents.

We use GA and statcounter for analytics anyways.</i><p>GA would cost you more than 50ms too. More so than a CDN controlled analytics. But obviously that cost with CDN is an upfront latency rather than the more hidden cost with background loading of GA. So arguably GA&#x27;s cost is less &quot;bad&quot; than the CDN&#x27;s cost.<p>Personally speaking, I prefer the CDN approach as it produces web pages with a lower browser footprint which I think does improve the user experience (though I&#x27;m not implying that GA give a bad user experience!).<p>GA does give a greater breadth of information than CDN analytics though. Often that&#x27;s the real deal breaker since analytics is usually driven by project managers / clients rather than by the developers.<p>> <i>Charts that show how much static traffic you saved are nice, but with bandwidth close to free, it&#x27;s not a big deal.</i><p>Oh it&#x27;s definitely a big deal if you serve high traffic websites ;) I&#x27;ve spent hours working against those kind of reports on projects that were seeing 100k concurrent users. I will say that these graphs aren&#x27;t so much about judging what <i>bandwidth</i> can be saved but more about judging what <i>requests can be offloaded</i>. The idea being the fewer calls to your origin servers you need to make, the more resources you have available in your farm for generating the dynamic content (dynamic content you cannot cache!). This also has the potential to save you money in server costs (depending on how they&#x27;re licenced) as well as improving site performance at peak times.<p>> <i>CDN analytics need to be better than GA at which point I will not only trade off latency but convert to premium all the way.</i><p>Indeed.

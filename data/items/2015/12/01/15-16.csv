Let me instead say you are mistakenly claiming that the dangers faced by straight while christian males is of equivalent or greater danger than those faced by minorities.<p>>The blog doesn&#x27;t claim this, nor does the DOJ data table which it reproduces.<p>No, but you are using that blog entry as evidence to support that claim.<p>Heres how the conversation went:<p>maaku said:<p>> The concern is not feelings getting hurt, but rather physical security as a person of minority status.<p>>This is something that a white heterosexual middle-class male (such as myself) can probably never fully appreciate, but I try to sympathize.<p>To which you responded:<p>>Actually white heterosexual middle class males can totally appreciate these things.<p>Using the source you linked as your evidence for that fact that straight white males have the same concern for physical security as minorities.  You further explained that whites, asians, and christians are in a position to be equally fearful for their safety as blacks, women, and other minorities.<p>Using this evidence, you closed your argument by saying:<p>>I&#x27;m sure most of us agree that his feelings are completely irrational and entirely his problem. So why aren&#x27;t the irrational fears held by various student groups treated the same way?<p>A dismissal of the complaints of minorities which you have written off by attempting to make an argument that straight white males have it just as bad as minorities, and thus if straight white males arent complaining, minorities have nothing more to complain about and should therefore shut up.<p>If you have a different argument to make, i would love to hear it.<p>EDIT:  I see you instead decided to downvote each of these comments, so i&#x27;ll just assume you indeed did not have a different argument to make.  Thanks for the discussion anyways, have a good one!",1448985599

Help us build the web tools to wrangle billions of transactions every day.<p>#About Connexity<p>Our team is sharp and works well together. We enjoy perks such as daily paid lunch, a 9/80 schedule (to get every other Friday off) and unconstrained vacation (don&#x27;t worry about having to build up enough vacation days for the family reunion); the culture of our team recognizes and respects the importance of your non-work life. Also, Ventura county is a pretty nice place to live/work (unless you hate temperate coastal weather). If you&#x27;ve got Rails or other relevant web app experience, that&#x27;s a good start. More importantly, you&#x27;ll be eager to learn display advertising (banner ads, RTB) inside and out. Attitude, ambition and sound judgement trump experience with a specific set of tools. We&#x27;re a small team within a medium-sized organization, and we work hard to keep the small-team vibe while availing ourselves of the best bits from the mother ship in Santa Monica.<p>#Position: Rails + exposure to Scala, Hbase & Kafka<p>We need someone to contribute to our Ruby on Rails app. It&#x27;s used to administer hundreds of advertising campaigns across hundreds of publisher sites. It&#x27;s not just boring CRUD. It provides a ton of control and insight to the team that operates our clients&#x27; campaigns; it&#x27;s truly the heart of our display advertising business. The business folks will know you, and you&#x27;ll find that excellence will stir up a tremendous amount of appreciation for your work. This role is a great way to learn advertising tech at scale as well as other tools. In addition to Rails work, you&#x27;d get hands on experience with Redis, Hbase, PostgreSQL, R and Scala. Several on the current team started in the Rails app and have moved into other areas of development (low-latency RTB bidder written in C, sophisticated reporting pipelines or novel optimization algorithms); so it&#x27;s a great position if you want to develop broader technical skills while really taking advantage of your growing knowledge of our vertical.<p>-- Unless you prefer to start with a HR-oriented chat, you can reach me (a lead engineer on the team) at david.larsen@connexity.com.",1448985597

Sadly most modern web stack fail at that. All hidden in mumbo jumbo of modules and dependencies no-one really needed or asked for, often created by people who never questioned the purpose of what they were doing, or if the whole internet needed it (because you are at Google and have found a neat way to deal with your huge JS stack doesn&#x27;t mean the whole web needed it too, and that you needed to spent a whole lot of effort making people adopt it).<p>As much as you make fun of C, learning and writing C will teach you to keep you programs simple and efficient, because the language requires it.

We look for aptitude over APIs. It doesn&#x27;t matter whether your resumé says PHP or PhD: if you&#x27;re smart, know some stuff and have empathy, we want to work with you.<p>Pivotal&#x27;s goal is to change the way the world makes software and we kinda sorta <i>really mean it</i>. We&#x27;re broken into three basic divisions: Pivotal Labs (yes, <i>that</i> Pivotal Labs), Pivotal Cloud Foundry and Pivotal Big Data. Rotations between divisions, temporarily or permanently, are possible.<p>We have offices in San Francisco, New York City, Santa Monica, Palo Alto, Seattle, Boulder, Denver, Chicago, Boston, Washington DC, Toronto, London, Dublin, Tokyo and Sydney. We will soon be opening an office in Berlin as well, with more to come. Relocations, temporarily or permanently, are possible.<p>Each of the three divisions has a constantly evolving and deliberately cross-pollinated culture. We are constantly thinking about how we work and how we can work more sensibly, effectively and enjoyably.<p>-- <i>Pivotal Labs</i>, from which the company draws its name and cultural seed, helps clients to become better at development. For engineering we are religiously lean and agile. In practice that means we pair program and TDD every line of code from the outside. Our product managers are fantastic at keeping products sharply focused, our designers are masters from users to pixels. We have a growing data science practice, and some engagements include all four roles.<p>-- <i>Cloud Foundry</i> solves application deployment and management. We&#x27;re the main contributors to CF. We&#x27;re expanding what is the leading opensource PaaS and our distribution has the fastest-growing sales of any opensource product ever. It&#x27;s also the only PaaS I&#x27;d personally bet a company on -- except for integrated upstream code, every line is pair programmed and TDD&#x27;d. We dogfood the cutting edge of the technology on our own commercial public cloud (Pivotal Web Services). It works because we took the XP and Lean DNA of Pivotal Labs and scaled it up to build the best cloud platform bar none.<p>-- <i>Big Data</i> is home to a fleet of battled-hardened products that we have been progressively open sourcing. Greenplum Database tackles some of the largest datasets in the world with the comfort and familarity of PostgreSQL. Apache HAWQ (incubating) brings Greenplum&#x27;s distributed query planner to Hadoop. Gemfire, which we donated as Apache Geode (incubating), is an in-memory distributed grid with years of high performance in high-stakes systems.<p>-- <i>Generally</i><p>At our offices we have free breakfast, weekly tech talks, good benefits and competitive pay. Ping pong is not mandatory, but it&#x27;s popular. I think west-coast ping pong is harder to beat, but east-coast style is more entertaining to watch. The beer fridge has more IPA than I prefer but I guess that&#x27;s life in paradise.<p>We provide visa and relocation assistance. In the NYC office we have about 15 people from overseas, including Australians like me.<p>You can apply through our website: <a href=""http://pivotal.io/careers"" rel=""nofollow"">http://pivotal.io/careers</a>.

[1] As a long time Thunderbird user in an Exchange/Outlook environment, I&#x27;m disappointed each time I hear news about its priority being pushed further down.<p>The TechCrunch article says, &quot;Apart from the fact that Mozilla had cut off most development support in 2012, Thunderbird has become a somewhat <i>anachronistic</i> product.&quot; For any enterprise or business environment where email still rules, calling Thunderbird &quot;anachronistic&quot; sounds misinformed and insulting. Thunderbird may not have the market share of Outlook or the glamor of smartphone based mail apps, but I&#x27;m sure those who use Thunderbird are really passionate about what it provides and the extensibility that comes with it.<p>One of the things I don&#x27;t like about the Mozilla of the past few years is the high amount of effort and time spent on Firefox OS. I don&#x27;t want to put that down, but Mozilla is trying very hard with very less traction on it and still pushing onward.<p>Mitchell&#x27;s message sounds like more planning is in the works to separate Thunderbird and probably make it stand on its own. This will take some time to plan and execute, with Thunderbird just languishing in the meantime. There could also be a complete re-write of Thunderbird, which is not really a great idea. I can see both optimistic and pessimistic views on what the future holds.<p>When Mozilla Messaging was announced, I had high hopes for better integration with Exchange calendaring and also improved search. All that went to nothing in 2012.<p>If Thunderbird ends up as a separate entity that I can donate directly to, I&#x27;ll be one of the first to do so!<p>[1]: <a href=""https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=10650432"" rel=""nofollow"">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=10650432</a>",1448984997

It&#x27;s a standard for creating markup languages, but use in HTML failed because it&#x27;s more verbose and doesn&#x27;t cope at all with user errors.<p>For data serialisation it&#x27;s just insane. The only reason to use XML to serialize your non markup data is that it&#x27;s a web technology and you have parsers everywhere. Mapping data back and forward between your data structures and the XML representation is a huge pain in the ass, as there&#x27;s no natural mapping. For some formats like SVG you basically have to keep data as a DOM in your program.<p>> And while XML is complicated there are far more complicated formats (YAML).<p>While the Syntax of YAML certainly is more complicated, totally I would say that it&#x27;s less complicated without all the XPath, Namespaces etc. you additionally need. YAML maps fairly direct to data structures of programs and the complexity is there to get human readability and edit ability. Something XML doesn&#x27;t have when used for general data.<p>> TOML<p>Is basically just a specification of the largely unspecified INI format, which is older than XML. This is just a format for human editable configuration files, for which we have experience that XML really really sucks.<p>> JSON<p>Very simple data format that maps directly to data structures of all common programming languages. The fact that JSON beat XML where XML is at home, in the web shows pretty clearly that JSON is the better format for data serialisation.<p>TL;DR: Use the correct format for the use case. XML is for markup, not serialisation. JSON is for serialisation, YAML is a better readable JSON e.g. if you mainly use the data for debugging, INI(/toml) is for configuration files.",1448984483

It says actions/qualities (or that most of life, actually) is meaningless, nothing, without love (as an attachment to God/Truth)<p>Second, it defines what is definitely not &quot;love&quot;, so one may not use it as a pretext for wrong doing (at least).<p>Third, it says that we will never see things fully, neither at once, until, that is, the end (provided it&#x27;s not an ellipsis, he! :) ).<p>Plus, &quot;love&quot; as expressed in this text is not Philia (<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philia"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philia</a>) but from Latin Caritas (<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charity_%28virtue%29"" rel=""nofollow"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charity_%28virtue%29</a>) (or Greek &quot;agape&quot;); which is not about a feeling, but about something way deeper, transcendant and, although not quite the right word, respectful, for one to an other. It&#x27;s love as one of the three Christian theological virtues (fides, spes, caritas), that is, in an intimate relation to the Christian God (in this context) as a guide, a goal, an ideal for love/Philia too.<p>> That love is genuine, and it doesn&#x27;t redeem the action.<p>I see your point. That love is, actually, deeply misled. Actually, that&#x27;s not love, that&#x27;s fear that supersedes love (&quot;I fear that you [x] and I don&#x27;t want to because this makes me [y] and I freak out and I don&#x27;t think you can decide for yourself, so I&#x27;ll do it and [z]&quot;).<p>Love (be it eros, philia or even agape) is no excuse to abuse.

This reinforcement leads to an echo chamber.<p>As a culture, we&#x27;re effectively putting canvasing over logic and reason in all areas. That&#x27;s essentially what you get from a social feed that reinforces your views - constant news that agrees with you...which is just canvasing yourself.<p>Canvasing feeds on feelings and reaction over reason. You look at just about any socially convenient topic and you&#x27;ll see this. Just as an example, let&#x27;s look at diversity in tech since this is Hacker News.<p>We&#x27;re more than willing to accost the entire industry for lack of diversity as if it&#x27;s somehow their fault. Yet most of these companies are falling all over themselves to hire people and we aren&#x27;t hearing stories about discrimination or people not getting jobs...we just see the numbers and assume something is wrong.<p>We&#x27;re not allowed to consider that people might tend to just be wired a certain way. Men&#x27;s brains work differently than women&#x27;s. Certain problems might be interesting to certain types of people and not to other.<p>Instead we create a cause and a problem that must be fixed immediately. We look at it from an emotional perspective rather than looking at all of the factors involved to just see if it happens to just be a general tendency or a real problem.<p>A problem is more marketable...so we go with that instead.",1448982503

10655768,comment,10654831,10654973,0,0,VLM,,,"&quot;respond to someone being wrong&quot;<p>I believe this might be your bone of contention.  The speech was a mission statement, more or less, with an introduction that is very catchy and exciting and clickbaity, but overall irrelevant to the main argument.  This is not a response of right or wrong.  Obviously the leader thinks people who oppose him are wrong, but the main thrust of the argument past that intro is &quot;where is what we are going to do here&quot;.<p>For example, obviously a long cultural time ago, although it was only a bit more than a decade, all the seniors at the school I finally graduated from (I was a part timer) took the same giant Holocaust class.  It was a required interdisciplinary liberal arts survey class, of a topic that changed every year.  I believe they had &quot;death&quot; as the topic another year.  They were obviously kind of a downer phase.  For cultural change reasons they don&#x27;t do this anymore, which is a shame.  Anyway the point of an interdisciplinary liberal arts class isn&#x27;t to debate philosophically if the topic is right or wrong, but to teach the students how to actually apply the full spectrum of liberal arts, all of them, because you&#x27;re all well rounded individuals now, to a topic.<p>Someone who disliked the idea of confronting a rather foreign culture and world view could fight against the class by demanding that you&#x27;re not allowed to respond to the Holocaust intellectually unless you can first express Hitler&#x27;s position in a way that modern Nazis would agree accurately represents their view.  Why yes I did just &quot;Godwin&quot; you.  But of course that logic is total bunk.  The real purpose of the class is to teach the students how to observe then analyze the inter-related whole of the topic, across multiple disciplines.  That requires application of intellectual skills, not right or wrong judgments.  You don&#x27;t need to express agreement with the text of mein kampf to see how the economic situation dovetailed with the political situation dovetailed with the cultural situation etc.  My term paper was how architecture related to the other liberal arts in the reich WRT to propaganda and scale and form etc.<p>Really the only reason why they gave us the Holocaust as a study topic was to scare the hell out of us, if we fail to learn the skills of cross disciplinary observation, analysis, and synthesis skills taught in the class, maybe something that bad will happen again.  Now for over sensitivity reasons, or more likely profound lack of courage, we can&#x27;t get that reward, can&#x27;t learn to avoid evil by intellectual analysis.  That opens a whole nother can of worms where the campus is now a safe space free of gas chamber triggering, but the whole country overall is far less of a safe space, because the current grads are emotionally coddled, less intellectually skilled, and far more cowardly unless acting in mob actions.  Luckily mob action historically has always been effective and rational, correct?  And we can make up for personal cowardice with more drone strikes, correct?  And the politician that proposes the simplest sounding solution is probably the best because we no longer have the intellectual rigor to analyze, correct?  I mean, what could possibly go wrong?",1448982194

We had all heard of isolated incidents of intolerance in the news, and had the sense that such sheltered students could be found on campus, but we didn&#x27;t personally know or associate with anyone who could be so extreme or intolerant in their beliefs. Which caused us to ask: how does a student like this get a spot at a decent university? Who raises their child to be so intolerant?<p>So I have to disagree with your claim that such intolerant and childish comments &quot;[smell] very much like what students today are saying.&quot; There is a vocal minority of students who say and do things that do not represent the larger body of students as a whole. There always will be. The average college student is still too busy meeting people, playing sports, dating, drinking, traveling, doing internships, interviewing for jobs, and (occasionally) going to lectures to make a big fuss out of anything that might offend him/her.",1448982034

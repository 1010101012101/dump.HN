An excellent place to start is the blog When The Sun Hits<a href=""http://whenthesunhitsblog.blogspot.be/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://whenthesunhitsblog.blogspot.be/</a>.  A good mix of &quot;classic&quot; shoegaze and new bands.<p>Shoegaze really defined my life. Taking a trip to London for an amazing Lush concert, wandering the streets of London and sleeping on the floor in a train station because I didn&#x27;t have any money left for even a hostel bed (I did buy some great and rare records though).  Or organizing a shoegaze party at a local bar,  low attendance of course and ending up being kicked out by the manager because &quot;this isn&#x27;t music!&quot; What&#x27;s wrong with Medicine? Good times.",1424177954

The essence of a walled garden is that it&#x27;s hard to get in, and if you&#x27;re not let in then you lose out. Mozilla only require signing by them or by someone else, which given the proliferation of malware is hard to see as a bad thing, especially given the privileged access granted to addons.<p>If you&#x27;re too stubborn to let Mozilla sign it AND too lazy to do it yourself then that&#x27;s your problem - you have no inalienable right to demand that people run your code if you can&#x27;t be bother to secure it. However you are never locked out of providing mozilla addons, you can still supply whatever you like.<p>Also, Why did this piece bother to quote the random verbal vomit of some internet commenters? What is that supposed to show? That some people online are rude and ignorant? Frankly there&#x27;s quite a bit of FUD in this thing, like asking if devs can trust that moving from Dev versions to production will break their code - pretty much the whole point of Mozilla&#x27;s development model in iterating and providing developer editions is to ensure that doesn&#x27;t happen.",1424177916

9061926,comment,9061592,9061853,0,0,tzs,,,"From the Mozilla add-ons blog, which is linked to in the article:<p><pre><code>    Extensions that change the homepage and search
    settings without user consent have become very
    common, just like extensions that inject
    advertisements into Web pages or even inject
    malicious scripts into social media sites. To combat
    this, we created a set of add-on guidelines all
    add-on makers must follow, and we have been
    enforcing them via blocklisting (remote disabling of
    misbehaving extensions). However, extensions that
    violate these guidelines are distributed almost
    exclusively outside of AMO and tracking them all
    down has become increasingly impractical.
    Furthermore, malicious developers have devised ways
    to make their extensions harder to discover and
    harder to blocklist, making our jobs more difficult.

    We’re responsible for our add-ons ecosystem and we
    can’t sit idle as our users suffer due to bad
    add-ons. An easy solution would be to force all
    developers to distribute their extensions through
    AMO, like what Google does for Chrome extensions.
    However, we believe that forcing all installs
    through our distribution channel is an unnecessary
    constraint. To keep this balance, we have come up
    with extension signing, which will give us better
    oversight on the add-ons ecosystem while not forcing
    AMO to be the only add-on distribution channel.</code></pre>",1424177567

Instead of thinking about a Turing Machine as just a head on an endless tape, can we not consider the Universe to represent the upper limits for our calculations? Just as Turing suggested that we can take the two dimensional representation of a mathematical equation and represent it in one dimension, can we represent the entire state of the Universe in a similar way on a hypothetical Turing Machine? The halting problem is then a question of whether or not the Universe has a halting state.<p>To extend from that, any machine that can be conceived must fit within the bounds of the Universe. Of course BB(Universe) is incalculable, but I think that it defines an upper limit. It is pointless to consider a Turing Machine that features an endless tape if an endless tape is an impossibility.<p>In not sure if this adds to the discussion, but I haven&#x27;t had anyone else I could discuss this with until now.",1424175087

It goes like this:<p>Imagine 2^(7n) copies of the judge of this competition. For every judge create a different bit sequence of length 7n. Decode it from ascii and ask if it is a valid entry of the competition. Take the largest valid entry of those imaginary competitions. That is my entry. In order for this procedure to be consistent, this entry must be longer than n characters. Hence it will end with some padding you may disregard: asdfasdfasdfasdfasdfasdfasdfasdfasdfasdf.",1424174624

What I do think is important is to kill dead this notion that achievement is not a necessary consideration for how to praise. For example:<p>I would be cautious about praising:<p>i) High effort but low performance due to repeating mistakes that have been pointed out before.<p>ii) Low effort but high performance due to luck or the task being easy for the individual.<p>I would find it important to praise:<p>i) Low effort but improved performance due to a change in behaviour e.g. learning from previous experience.<p>ii) High effort but low performance due to how novel or ambitiously challenging the task is for the individual.",1424174597

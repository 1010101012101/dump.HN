Most of the small startups I see these days, unfortunately including YC startups, seem to be launching with the idea of doing one cool thing, having no idea how to make money in so doing, and hoping to get bought out in a talent acquisition by Google or Facebook before they run out of money.  In many cases, it seems to be less about entrepreneurship and more about putting together a really cool portfolio so you'll get a massive signing bonus when you get hired. Now, that's certainly a legitimate way to make money, and it makes sense for the angels and founders participating in YC and the like.  But it's not entrepreneurship.<p>How many of the angel-backed startups these days are really looking to be long-term players? How many are looking to IPO in 10 years, vs get acquired in 2-3? How many founders envision themselves as the CEO of their company in 20 years? The fail fast mentality seems, on the surface, to be a reflection on an underlying current in the founder mindset: that entrepreneurship is a way to make enough money that you won't have to get a ""real job"".  Just slug it out fo a few years, then become an angel yourself.",1294953368

Browser != data format.<p>I can see the point you're arguing (or at least what the author is trying to argue, whether or not it's your opinion as well). But it's at best a stretch.<p>In the IE6 ""glory"" days, it wasn't just a case that Websites wouldn't be made to work for other browsers (meaning they were never tested or, if they were, it was beyond scope to fix). It was worse than that. Sites would deliberately look at the user agent and simply not work if it was a non-IE browser. This <i>still</i> happens. I still come across sites that not only warn you they're optimized for IE and FF (ie proceed at your own ""risk"" when using Chrome). Some go further and simply <i>won't work</i> if you try and use Chrome. It's thankfully rare but it still happens.<p>Anyway, the point here is the IE6 displayed HTML/CSS content differently than other browsers and had JS differences too. It took effort to make things cross-browser and it was (and arguably still is) a big deal.<p>So the stretch of comparing H.264 to IE6 is twofold:<p>1. We're talking about the entire Web vs the narrow context of Web-based videol so it's a question of <i>scope</i>; and<p>2. Converting video from one format to another can be automated. Converting a site designed for IE6 to work on other browsers cannot.<p>So not only aren't the problems analogous but the author is engaging in scaremongering to try and equate H.264 with the (stipulated) horrors of IE6.",1294953125

We would certainly not condone that type of behaviour, as not only is it unethical but also illegal.<p>2. None of the members of the Vuru team nor any associated parties own any shares in HNHI.OB.<p>@artmageddon<p>We weren't trying to sweep his rap history under the rug. The title of the article calls him 50 Cent... What we were attempting to achieve was paint him as more than just a rap star with an entrepreneurial streak. In our opinion, he's more an entrepreneur with a musical streak.<p>Even in his music, he's focused on producing mass market rap. The type that rings up millions in sales. He's not as focused on the art aspect of it. Compare him to Kanye West who is certainly more focused on the art of music. 50 follows a specific formula to create hits and encourages all artists on his label to do the same. He's about the money.<p>@andyparkinson<p>We are working on some Value Investing goodness and I'm glad that you do follow us for our insights.<p>In relation to the Twitter debacle, the article's focus is on the rules 50 Cent follows in achieving strong investment results. While we'd agree that uneducated investors shouldn't buy stocks nor should any investors buy pink sheets, we think it's unfair to crucify 50 for pushing a stock that he believes in.<p>As Jesse Eisenberg questioned, ""Is what 50 Cent did really that different from what happens all day long on CNBC when professional money managers take to the airwaves to praise the stocks of companies they already own?"" We believe that they are similar situations, assuming 50 didn't know any bad non-public information about the stock and touted it anyways.",1294953119

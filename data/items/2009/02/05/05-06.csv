Maybe I'm naive, but I think smart people DO change. Change is also called learning from our mistakes, and It's a trait I see a lot of in entrepreneurial-types. The real issue is that large companies rarely allow for the sort of 1:1 ratio of actions and consequence that are necessary for real personal change. If I'm running my own startup and I'm a jerk, I will feel the consequences of that. If I'm midlevel management at a big corp, the fact that I'm otherwise competent will protect me from the chance to see how my behavior impacts my situation poorly.",1233813559

If you study the structure of these sorts of threads on reddit, I think one of the best tweaks we could make to avoid that sort of rot would be to auto-collapse any reply thread that has x% of replies that are under a certain character count unless the parent comment has a relatively high karma value. As you pointed out, sometimes the pithy statement is needed to break the ice, but rarely would and valuable discussion involve 6-7 one-sentence replies in a row, which is what you get when a conversation on reddit devolves to a joke-fest.<p>Auto-collapsing threads for comments that are below a certain karma threshold seems like a nice tool as well - it still allows access if you want to parse the thread, and trolls still have a place to do trollish things, but it moves the behavior into an opt-in situation where you have to actually click on the thread in order to see it.",1233812771

467148,comment,467041,467041,0,0,Jebdm,,,"The technique is cool, but in this case the customization doesn't seem very helpful.  The default buttons are more comfortable to use, I think, although a flat color background or a rounded button or something might be nice. A gradient on something so small, on the other hand, is overkill.  (I don't mind all gradients; a soft gradient in the background can have a good effect.)<p>I do like the way they regrouped the buttons on the toolbar, but I wish there was a little more space between them.  Put a few pixels between the buttons in each group; then, perhaps, put a slightly different color behind the buttons to emphasize their grouping.  It'd also be nice if the ""more actions"" dropdown was right-aligned.<p>I really like the interface on the ""Move To"" and ""Labels"" buttons.  The ""move to"" option doesn't seem to fit in very well with the whole label-based interface, though.  It's much more intuitive to label something and then archive it (it's just one more click/keystroke).  ""Move to"" doesn't add any new functionality; it does makes label+archiving slightly more convenient, but it clutters up the menu, so I'd say remove it.<p>And once the ""move to"" button is gone, it probably makes sense to move the input box that you get when you click ""label"" directly onto the bar with the archive/report spam/delete buttons.  Add a dropdown arrow to get to the list of labels/management stuff, and put ""Labels"" grayed-out in the input box by default to clarify what it's for.<p>The easiest improvement, I think, would be to iconify the Archive, Report Spam, and Delete buttons.  That would be fairly easy to do, and it would make it easier to distinguish the function of each item and declutter the menu.<p>The last thing I'd like to mention may just be a matter of taste, but I definitely preferred the older color scheme.  There isn't a big difference:<p><pre><code>              OLD                   NEW\n  MAIN BOX    light blue            light blue\n  RSS BAR     lighter blue          darker blue\n  READ ITEMS  lighter gray-blue     light gray\n</code></pre>\nThis change in color scheme totally switches the ""look and feel"" of the app for me from a pleasant, Google-y environment to a corporate, enterprise-y one.  Maybe this was intentional, but I'd like to change it.  There is a ""classic"" theme available, but it doesn't quite get the colors right and regardless I use Google Apps and Themes haven't been rolled out to me yet.  For now, I'm reverting to the ""older version"".<p>Overall, I love Gmail.  Just a little constructive criticism ;)",1233812213

You're typing something in one window, and then some other window comes along that pops open and steals your focus away.  So now, your typing continues in a new context, where each key now has new meaning.  Worst case, you happen to hit Enter, at the exact time something like a message pops open, causing you to ""accept"" something that you didn't even read.<p>I have seen this with every OS, with many different applications, and with different window managers on Linux.

Pike's implementation incorporated submatch tracking into an efficient NFA simulation but, like the rest of the Eighth Edition source, was not widely distributed. Pike himself did not realize that his technique was anything new.

Take a very simple example; maybe a bunch of animals suddenly finds itself in a place where the weather is rather colder. We know that in a few generations those genes which favour a thicker coat will have come to the fore and we'll come and we'll find that the animals have now got thicker coats. Early man, who's a tool maker, doesn't have to do this: he can inhabit an extraordinarily wide range of habitats on earth, from tundra to the Gobi Desert - he even manages to live in New York for heaven's sake - and the reason is that when he arrives in a new environment he doesn't have to wait for several generations; if he arrives in a colder environment and sees an animal that has those genes which favour a thicker coat, he says 'I'll have it off him!'""<p>Douglas Adams",1233810148

  possible examples of ""coding""
</code></pre>
So sad to see similar statements. I am the only one who <i>loves</i> working with
HTML and CSS? I wouldn't say I love PHP, sure it is not the best language out there, but it is not <i>that</i> bad. Unless you never bothered to check
out what's in PHP 5 (or 5.3) and keep going with PHP 4 code.<p>Don't dismiss HTML. Sure, it is not programming, but so often good programmers produce crap HTML maybe dismissing it as trivial and not
worth learning properly. However producing page in HTML and CSS involves a lot of similar activity: you evaluate the whole system (layout) you have to build, identify different parts, decide how to code them in proper, <i>semantic</i> way, avoiding unnecessary elements,
then style it all in CSS, maybe enhance with some Javascript. At the
same time you don't forget about progressive enhancement and graceful
degradation, cross browser support (this is less fun part).<p>I think the task of splitting that finished visual picture of design into
proper HTML structure and CSS decoration is the actual difficulty some
are facing, but mistakenly thinking thats the problem with CSS.<p>And now, with HTML5 on the doorstep and all the fun CSS3 allows front-end coding is even more exciting. My recent interest — client-side optimization
adds to this excitement. I learned about programming by reading code in some magazines (had no access to computers till my first year at university), now
I've been coding for 20 years, doing web work for 14, went all the way from first HTML being rendered in Netscape 2 through table layouts (oh those nested tables to get 1px border in IE and 1x1 GIFs…) to CSS3 layouts with fun effects rendered in WebKit nightly. I am equally well versed in both client side and server side development, but I'd say that even after all these years I still think client-side work is a lot of fun.<p>I initially was attracted to web because I enjoyed learning and trying a wide range of technologies: from working with graphics in Photoshop to setting up and configuring Apache. Still feeling the same.",1277070972

Real time strategy games, first person shooters with complex AI, and other games that are networked in lock-step are <i>already</i> completely deterministic and have to be for it to work at all. You basically get replays for free that way, but it has to be a conscious effort of the entire team to maintain determinism.<p>Luckily, determinism is something that you can verify with an automated process. After each checkin, run some automated tests on a server farm. Run them twice. During the first run, take a full game world state snapshot periodically. During the second run, verify that the world state is identical since the first run. If it isn't, re-run the test twice. Take snapshots more frequently during the interval where determinism broke. Recurse like a binary search. You can automatically pin-point the exact frame where the simulations diverge.<p>One you have a replay file and the exact frame, you have the best  bug report on the planet. ""This replay is build 12345 and crashes on frame 54321"". Fire it up in the debugger, run a system command ""fast forward to frame 54321"" and then just start stepping. Oh, it crashes on that line? Let's drill into that: restart replay, set breakpoint, run to frame 54321, step-in. Freaking beautiful.",1277069061

We already know (historically, empirically) that counting & manipulating 'stuff' is what works for making applicable theories. Mathematical abstraction preserves those ""traits"", & makes the object more general - ie more flexible. Chess for example is about counting, but it's not explicitly written in a form that allows you to drop it in a theory.<p>I think the important thing is the traits aren't arbitrary. They were forced on people, eg you need to learn counting if you want to keep track of your goats.",1277068990

In this paper, we explore optimal partitioning techniques for spatial data for different types of queries, and develop multi-disk allocation techniques that maximize the degree of I/O parallelism obtained during the retrieval. We show that hexagonal partitioning has optimal I/O cost for circular queries compared to all possible non-overlapping partitioning techniques that use convex regions. For rectangular queries, we show that although for the special case when queries are rectilinear, rectangular grid partitioning gives superior performance, hexagonal partitioning has overall better I/O cost for a general class of range queries. We then discuss parallel storage and retrieval techniques for hexagonal partitioning using current techniques for rectangular grid partitioning.""<p><a href=""http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.16.8088"" rel=""nofollow"">http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.16.8...</a>",1277068341

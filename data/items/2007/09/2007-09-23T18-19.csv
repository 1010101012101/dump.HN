58583,comment,58521,58521,0,0,karzeem,,,"Like the commenters at Rough Type say, ""graph"" is just the word for how programmers conceptualize a network (as in graph theory).  Winer is right that there's no reason to expose consumers to that kind of jargon, though.  The reason that it's popping up is that Facebook has been using it since they launched their platform in May, I suspect with the hope that the term will remain closely associated with them so that when people think social networks (or social graphs, as it happens), they think Facebook.",1190572711

They're both pretty clear now, but you're right that for most people, there doesn't seem to be much reason to use Ning.<p>I could see it gaining some traction with corporate intranets, though, especially with a focus on content sharing.",1190572102
58581,comment,58564,58569,0,0,Alex3917,,,"""But I suspect it's really more integrated: that everything is ""just space"", with the particles being something like special little lumps of connectivity in the network corresponding to space.""<p>He's not saying it's definitely a network, he's just saying that he's going to start looking there because it intuitively makes sense. This seems reasonable for a few reasons. First, networks are the most advanced form of organization we currently know of. Second, it potentially provides a very simple explanation for many things, such as gravity. Third, the idea that matter is just really concentrated nothingness is just too cool not to look at. And it sort of makes sense if you believe in zero-point energy, which supposedly both general relativity and quantum mechanics predict (according to the free energy nuts).<p>/not a theoretical physicist

Maybe I'm just difficult (and was never meant to be an employee), but my motivation and interest in a project drops off of a cliff when someone comes to me at the outset -- before any information is known -- and tells me not only <i>how</i> to do the project, but the <i>schedule</i> in which I'm going to do it.  To me, that's the antithesis of creativity.<p>Am I wrong?  Sometimes I don't know if I'm just a prima donna, but this blogger sounds like every middle-manager who has ever driven me away from software.  If you're going to ""manage"" creative people, it seems that you have to find a way to harness their creativity and go along for the ride.  Keeping the horses in a pen doesn't do you much good....",1190571417

If you actually want to find the model via searching programs, this is the only realistic way to do it.",1190570802

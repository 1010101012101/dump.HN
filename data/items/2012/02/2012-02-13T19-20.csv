3587098,comment,3586883,3586883,4,0,jpastika,,,"Two years ago I began developing a large web application and I had to choose a language and stack.  Having built applications on .NET and PHP most recently, I knew I could fall back on either and be safe.  I decided to investigate RoR and .NET MVC.  For whatever reason, RoR felt strange and I knew it would have a steeper learning curve initially, but probably be more efficient to develop with in the long run.  On the other hand, .NET MVC felt a bit more familiar, and had many attractive qualities that ""appeared"" to mimic RoR.  I went with .NET MVC.  Now 2 years later I find myself spending my day job in .NET MVC and my side projects are all RoR.  I found that .NET MVC was a great bridge from regular .NET to RoR.  I am frustrated that I didn't pursue RoR harder 2 years ago, but hind sight is 20/20.  I am extremely happy to be working on side projects in RoR because honestly it is more fun.  Don't get me wrong, RoR isn't all roses, I'm just finding fewer weeds!",1329163093

When building a startup (as my wife and I are doing with Postkin.com), it's often helpful to create free, fun ""viral side-along"" projects. Although seemingly a diversion from your core business, fun sideprojects like this can introduce new people to your idea and help build your audience.<p>We've create viral side-alongs for several of our projects here at Qlabs, and so far they seem to be some of the most effective ways to expose people to our products while adding a bit more awesome to the internet.<p>I'm happy to answer any tech questions anyone has about the project, as well as talk more about the viral side-along concept if anyone is interested.",1329162739
3587080,comment,3586215,3586215,2,0,ChuckMcM,,,"So close, and yet so far.<p>I like to the tell the story that a poor nerd can go into Fry's (electronics store) and get all the parts to build themselves a pretty decent computer, a rich nerd can go into Fry's and not buy anything. The difference is that the rich nerd <i>could by</i> anything, and that choice freeze them. The poor nerd has a budget and has to work within it, so they have already done the work to maximize their value given their budget. Since the rich nerd has no budget they would have to analyze every possible system they could build out of Fry's parts to have the same confidence in their buying decision as the poor nerd has, and frankly there isn't enough time for that. Stalemate.<p>In the startup world there is an interesting and dangerous place called the 'self funded' or 'privately funded' startup. Those places have a hard time because there is nobody to call their baby ugly and question their assumptions. If your money isn't asking you questions about your existence then you won't ask yourself those questions.<p>I interviewed at one such and asked how they expected to make money. ""Advertising"" they said, their CEO was adamant that they had a unique position with respect to their customers which would allow them to advertise more effectively to them. And I asked ""So why would people who are already spending their ad budget with Google advertise with you?"" and the answer was ""We are bringing new people to the Internet, people who have never advertised on this scale before, we're growing the market."" And that was when I thought 'Oh really?' Now you could test that theory, you could survey your users and look at their advertising budgets and you could talk to ad agencies and look to see if they were trying to find new channels. But if you did all of that, it would dispel the illusion that the advertising market was growing, its actually shrinking in terms of total dollars (yes the Internet is disruptive again).<p>So Markham concludes that 'rich' startups failing because they spend all of their money buying products. The counter being that a 'poor' or 'lean' startup would be forced to husband their cash more carefully and build their own tools. The effect is there, but I believe the conclusion is not. One of the things that the poor startup is being forced to do, is develop a competency in being a company. Its not a state that everyone is familiar with.<p>Lots of people know how to be employees, but not how to be a company. Initially, those new to startups, aren't thinking so much about how long they have to live (as a company) as how much cool stuff they can do with that fat wad of cash. Perhaps they haven't experienced the pain of trying to raise money while working 12 hr days, or had a product they depend on go bad, mid-development cycle, and scrambled to replace it. There are lots of things like that which can, and do, bite you.<p>It isn't rich vs poor, its disciplined cash management vs undisciplined cash management. Doesn't matter where you start from if you don't respect the cost of capital you will fail.",1329162735

However, you are going to work just as hard, if not harder, than a local student and not get credit that can be used towards a proper university degree.  I understand that this is an experiment.

But the ""happy birthday!"" messages on facebook, imo, have lost their meaning and relevance a long time ago. There's no thought or effort that goes into this action. In the early stages of facebook, there was still a couple more steps that had to be taken to get that message to the old acquaintance. Thus, albeit small, a little more meaning. ""Oh, frank, he actually took those couple steps, thats so nice.""<p>Now, as a society, as well as on facebook, we're a step away from automating our wishing people happy birthdays. That progression is what is slowly chipping away at that ""nice sentiment."" For all I know, you write heartfelt messages to old acquaintances, leaving them feeling awesome that you cared to write to them on such a day. But the vast majority don't, facebook tells them to say happy bday to these people [list of names]. Without even leaving the page, and following exactly what facebook tells you to say, you've said the most generic thing you can possibly say to someone on their birthday.And to top it off, you haven't said anything to that person since last year on that day. And again, by ""you"", I mean the majority of people, not you personally.<p>The occasional person will go the ""extra mile"" sticking the persons name at the end of the message, or saying something like ""hope you're doing well!""..It's just an illusion that that doesn't mean much of anything. I'm not saying I hate getting 100s of ""Happy bday's"" from people I don't talk to or, in a lot of cases, even know. Or that people are assholes for routinely wishing every single person on their friends list a big happy birthday. But the sentiment really isn't even there anymore, to me. All facebook has done for us, as far as birthdays and keeping in touch with old acquaintances in this manner is concerned, is make the actual efforts, like phone calls and real personal messages, even more valuable.",1329162148

Yet you seem to be lumping them together in your post...<p>Inside your link it says, for something to be considered ""obscene"":<p>>The Miller test stems from Miller v. California, 413 U.S. 15 (1973), in which the US Supreme Court held that material is obscene if each of the following factors is satisfied:<p>>1) Whether the average person, applying contemporary community standards, would find that the work, taken as a whole, appeals to the prurient interest;<p>>2) Whether the work depicts/describes, in a patently offensive way, sexual conduct specifically defined by applicable law;<p>>3) Whether the work, taken as a whole, lacks serious literary, artistic, political, or scientific value.<p>So, by law ALL THREE of the ""obscene"" criteria have to be met for it to be considered obscene. I want to focus in on #2, because I don't think pictures of children in bathing suits is sexual in nature.  If it were, then taking your children out in public wearing said bathing suit would be illegal too...  Now, people looking at those pictures may be sexualizing these images in the head, but the images themselves break no laws and show no nudity.  So why exactly is reddit drawing the line there?  Also, why is Toddlers in Tiaras fine? (there's a subreddit for that too).  I don't understand what makes it so different to you (and to reddit admins).<p>I kept reading and further down in your link it says:<p>>Child pornography is any visual depiction, where ""(A) the producing of such visual depiction involves the use of a minor [under 18] engaging in sexually explicit conduct; and (B) such visual depiction is of such conduct."" 18 U.S.C.  2252 The law prohibits knowingly possessing or transmitting (including by computer) child pornography.<p>I'm positive that children in swimsuits does not constitute being sexually explicit, so I'm still not getting why you are considering it illegal...<p>Finally, you say 
>when reddit (finally) decides to crack down on something that is plainly not legal speech<p>Yet, based on the legal definition that you provided these subreddits, for the most part, are participating in legal, albeit creepy, speech.

Furthermore, we would never have developed a concept of narcissism at all.<p>With that said, we all do narcissistic things. Narcissism is only a problem when it gets out of control. That is why we have expert psychologists and psychiatrists to take care of this, and define what is and is not an acceptable level of narcissism (in the DSM-IV definition for narcissistic personality disorder)<p>Sure, there are reasons to be for, or against narcissistic behavior.

The jailbait one was depicted on Anderson Cooper's show as having pictures likely grabbed from Facebook: e.g. teenagers in swim suits. There was also mention of a single commenter claiming to have more revealing pictures of an underage ex-girlfriend (which sounded like they would have qualified as child pornography), which prompted other commenters to ask him to privately message them with links. I was under the impression that this was the most illegal thing on that subreddit, and that the main problem was that people thought it was creepy to have pictures of minors in swim suits.

I think that counts as <i>there being an obvious way</i>.<p><pre><code>    def pipe(val, fns):

Twisted(reactors) and threads implement two different things which serve different purposes, and unittest2 is a lib while nose is a test runner.

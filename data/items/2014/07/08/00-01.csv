That&#x27;s why we like it.</i> A concrete example of keeping JSON clean was the removal of comments from the JSON spec to stop people using them as directives. If they had stayed, and JSON became complex and ugly and messy, would its popularity have continued?<p>However... the increasing prevalence of complex JSON formats may eventually make <i>some form of</i> JSON schema necessary.",1404781193

8002431,comment,7999725,8001821,1,0,srean,,,"I will second your observation. I have often observed (purely anecdotal) that runtime polymorphism gets used gratuitously even when compile time polymorphism would have sufficed. In my C++ code I seem to be reaching for CRTP fairly often and it does its job. In this case there would be little benefit to be had by inlining virtuals. In fact modern compilers do take a stab at devirtualization, but of course they surely cannot be as informed as a runtime system. Without adequate support to detect exhaustiveness, compile time polymorphism does have the drawback that one could forget to account for all the different cases. This is an instance where Ocaml does better. Sure exhaustiveness can fail, but it requires far less discipline to code in a way that it doesnt. Sure, in future I might need to add more cases, but the beauty is that the type system will tell me all the places where I need to handle the newly inserted case. This takes care of majority of the use case of virtual functions. Exhaustiveness checked pattern matching is a killer feature !<p>Side note, compile time polymorphism ought to be easier to do in D than C++.<p>I dont have a problem with JIT. In fact the later the system emits actual code the more information it has at its disposal which it can presumably use to emit better code.<p>What I disagree with, however, is the widespread defense of the practice of emitting crappy byte code with the justification that we will fix the mess at runtime when and if poor codegen becomes a problem. This self inflicted pessimization of moving that starting block behind is what bugs me. For a scripting language I can buy this, a script could potentially start faster. But Java (the current mainstream poster boy of a JITed language) is no scripting language.<p>When I am compiling the code with optimization I have more time at my disposal, make use of it. I will even help you (the compiler) with profiles collected from previous runs if I think they would be helpful. If that means spending effort optimizing parts of the code that never get run in future, that is fine, I can tolerate that because I have time now. If some of that effort is wasted, fine I can take that hit, sky wont fall. On the other hand when my system is running, I am indeed short of time and very little budget for optimization and analysis, so cannot run very deep optimizations. Not all tasks can afford JIT burn in.<p>For me a superior way would be to optimize hard AOT, clear all the low hanging fruits. Have JIT hooks that can change code to adapt to runtime characteristics to mop up whatever further benefits that remain.",1404779605

And it did it in a way that substantially reduced the &quot;boilerplate&quot; syntax burden, which most of us take for granted, but is a large pain for newcomers to programming.<p>print &quot;hello, world&quot;<p>is very easy for a beginner.<p>Depending on what your background is,<p>[(i*3) for i in [1, 2, 3]]<p>may be a very clear way to multiply every element of an array by 3.  Or it may be confusing as heck. :)<p>Our general hope is that by the time our current first years make it through the program that there will be even less of an emphasis on OOP needed.  C0, for example, introduces an additional component of formal reasoning, and my shift of 15-440 replaced C++ with Go, which has a modestly less &quot;OOP&quot;-centric flavor.  The big drawback now is that the transition from 110/112 to the formality of C0 and the functional intro with ml is rather jarring.  That&#x27;s partly by design, to get people to think about computer science differently than what they might have learned about &quot;programming&quot; in high school, but we&#x27;ll see if we can optimize it.<p>(I&#x27;m posting about this because I&#x27;ll be teaching 15-112 with David Kosbie next Spring.)",1404778970

CA state tax is not 100% or 200% higher than most states. But housing is.<p>The point of moving to CA for most people is to live on or near the coast, I think... Thus most centers of commerce in CA is relatively close to the beach, like SF or LA or San Diego.<p>What this does is it almost immediately cuts the the available land for housing by HALF. In midwest of US (including Texas), you put a dot and draw 30 mile circle around it. All of that land is available for housing. In coastal regions like coastal California, put a dot near coast and draw a 30 mile circle around it.

8002335,comment,8000166,8001307,6,0,VonGuard,,,"Journo here. Very, very true. PR runs most of the stories you see. They don&#x27;t usually run the hard news, like disasters and such, but they often glom onto those things so after a day or two, it&#x27;s hard to tell who&#x27;s actually reporting, and who&#x27;s just regurgitating, and who&#x27;s being spoon fed bullshit.<p>We could debate the many reasons for this fact, but suffice to say that there is A: a lot of money riding on getting such stories printed, and B: not enough time in the day or money to pay journalists to do the real work.<p>This plays out in a couple ways. The most common form is where the PR firm is also representing a company that advertises in the outlet. The New York Times writing about suits was probably printed on a page next to an ad for Macy&#x27;s. The editorial guys are not complicit, but it&#x27;s become common for sales to make &quot;intros&quot; to editors at parties and such. It&#x27;s gross, but common.<p>Another way it plays out is that we get some amazing, long article with in-depth journalism that&#x27;s just the best thing you&#x27;ve ever read. Then no one reads it because it&#x27;s really long and doesn&#x27;t have pretty pictures, so compared to the story linked next to it on the front page, it&#x27;s basically a one or two day blip in the system, then it&#x27;s forgotten. Meanwhile, that other story with a title like &quot;Docker will revolutionize datacenters,&quot; or &quot;Google Glass User Assaulted,&quot; are getting the same number of hits, and they took about 10 seconds to write, so as a journalist, it can be a bit frustrating to be beholden to &quot;hits,&quot; rather than to &quot;quality.&quot;<p>Which, frankly, is what most journos are dealing with. Most outlets want quantity over quality. That means the writers tend not to understand what they&#x27;re writing about, but rather, they&#x27;re just flying over and giving a scouting report in a vain attempt to be first.<p>The Wire got this soooo right in season 5. Beat reporters need to cover their beats. The smaller the beat, the better they should be able to cover it. If you have one reporter on programming only, you can really get the pulse of the industry, rather than just having your tech reporter check in every 3 months.<p>Journalism remains broken, with many examples of great work being ignored in favor of &quot;10 reasons Beiber is made of plastic, and what types of plastic those would be if he were made of them,&quot; stuff. How are we going to write about people places and events when those people places and events are writing about themselves for free.",1404778030

But it also teaches circuits, discrete signals stuff (e.g., the z-transform), probability, graph search, state estimation, etc.  It&#x27;s a breadth-first intro to EECS, whereas SICP is more of a depth-first intro to the building blocks of computer programs.",1404778019

A good management system should be able to efficiently handle hundreds or even millions of components.<p>And what if we standardized support for the scripting languages?  So, for example, the DOM calls looked like RESTFUL services returning JSON.  And maybe there was a low-level, but efficient virtual machine that everyone could target (someone mentioned LLVM -- although I really don't care what it is all that much).<p>It just feels like the web is in this weird cycle where we continue to make suboptimal choices... largely because that's how it was done the first time.",1285959581

It would be very costly for the algorithms to risk too much money on probing at an inaccurate price, so chances are the ""hot potato"" was not very deep at all.<p>Nonetheless, your point stands that it could be an artifact of the traders expecting human-like decisions to underly the phenomena they saw.<p>(it does seem implausible to me, but oh well)",1285959556
1748149,comment,1747318,1747318,0,0,tptacek,,,"Careful. The author of this article believes he's made an observation about which open source model is more effective, but he hasn't. Rather, he's observing that there are price-insensitive markets where it doesn't make sense to hold back components, because you'll get paid either way.<p>A (niche) counterexample to this is Nessus, the most popular open source security scanner. Until a few years ago, Nessus was entirely GPL with a commercially-licensed counterpart product. But a huge chunk of Nessus' market isn't F-500 companies with big IT budgets, but consultants, who are <i>very</i> price sensitive. Tenable had to retreat from GPL altogether in later versions because the market was free-riding.<p>It is not always the case that ""the most open"" product wins.<p>When you're selling mostly to big companies, IT managers will pay almost no matter what; it's actually easier for them to sign a PO than it is to drive adoption of a free offering, because IT organizations are organized around purchasing-centric projects. So it makes sense that Red Hat would keep everything maximally free, to capitalize on the marketing benefit of a thriving community.",1285959544

It is still so because PC hardware manufacturers prefer to retain status quo and not fix what is not broken. This is so with many other things in PC architecture, as well. I.e. take the ATX power connections: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ATX"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ATX</a>. We could be using just one voltage (+12V or other) going to the motherboard long ago.

But the manufacturers are content with the status quo.

Since it's a pay-as-you-go system, it can't run out of money like a bank account.  Instead, it will simply be taking in less than it should be paying out.  The current best estimates are that Social Security will be paying out around 75% of what it should be paying out by the time that people in their 20's now retire.

Anyway, I completely agree with you that once your ark ship arrives in a new solar system landing on a planet like Gliese 581g would be counterproductive.<p>Instead of having to deal with a gravity well it would be better to make a home in something like the asteroid belt. You only need energy & resources for manufacturing capacity, a gravity well can only complicate that process.<p>People might still want to live on planets as a novelty, or for their resources.

It was our view that previous personal finance solutions (Quicken, MS Money, and the following web-based solutions) catered more towards the technically/financially proficient, and had therefore missed the larger market opportunity.<p>So we tried our best to ignore the Silicon Valley drivel around ""viral distribution"" and ""cloud security"" and focus instead on issues like ""How can we make it easier for a soccer Mom in Kansas to set and meet her monthly grocery budget?"".<p>The Mint brand (including the name, visuals, and user experience) were all designed with this in Mind.

You can create crap in any language but some make it easier than others to write good code.<p>As an example, Javascript. You can write beautiful code in Javascript and it isn't that hard but to do it, you need to to understand closures. Closures aren't the easy topic for a new programmer to grasp immediately so it might not be the best language. I would say that python and ruby are better for making it easy to learn good practices compared to php, perl or javascript and would suggest either of those as a first language to start learning with.  It doesn't have to be the language you stick with but both are good for getting you going. You aren't out of the woods by picking either of them but I think you will find the experience easier. Of the two, I would lean towards python as it has a very 'one proper way to do it' approach which is easy on beginners. That said, you can't go wrong with either. If you want to venture slightly further afield, both scheme and smalltalk are excellent languages to do as a first language. If either of those tickle your fancy, I would look at racket for a scheme implementation and pharo for the smalltalk. Pharo has learning tools when you fire it up and racket has a ton of learning materials.<p>The first two languages I learned where a Forth variant and a straight up machine language. So any language can be your first one. I realized later on that while I had learned to program, I hadn't learned to do it well and went back and studied the hows and whys which I think any of the 4 above would be very good places to start with.<p>EDIT:<p>One last note, if you decide to go with Javascript, I strongly urge you to read 'Javascript: The Good Parts' very early on in the process.",1285957333

Doctors are incentivized to prescribe costly tests.  They get paid more w/ every test/procedure, and tests also serve to cover their asses.  Patients also, often, demand the testing.<p>Those who are against tort reform often use some statistics showing that tort fees only account for a tiny percentage of health costs, but they miss a deeper relationship between the fear of being sued (most doctors get sued at some point in their career) and the defensive, expensive, care doctors give.",1285956637

A sales receipt for a car, for example, doesn't start out, ""5 tires (4 on vehicle, 1 spare), 2 axles..."" It just doesn't work that way. You buy ""government"" with your taxes.<p>Even if you did get an itemized receipt for a car, <i>that</i> would be far easier than what's proposed here. You can always just point to the car and account for the parts. The part is either there or not, and meets specifications or not. The reason that government and spending are these intractable issues is that the parts can be arguably there or not, and arguably working or not.<p>As long as you can't opt out of all or a portion of your taxes, in other words, as long as tax policy is sane, the only ""receipt"" you should get should specify that you paid the amount you calculated. Any other discussion or education about costs and allotment should happen in a forum that at least has a chance of shedding some real light.<p>Finally, if the receipt ever became the focus of public attention, politicians will just monkey with the categories until you're happy again.

Companies succeed or fail for two reasons - CEO and cash flow. The importance of a CEO is usually understated but the CEO is critical. Being a visionary, cracking the whip when necessary and instilling values (excellence is the first) cant be replaced. He is driving the company forward. He can be a coder but he should not write single line of code. His role is to manage not to develop. As per Cash flow. Given enough cash flow, anything can be fixed. Company can relaunched, product improved and marketing invested. As per Wesabe vs. Mint. In this day and age people who give control of their accounts to ANY third party are plain crazy. However, the buzz instilled confidence in people and they think Mint is safe. Wesabe could have had a place in the market with people who don’t trust Mint's approach. The issue was, it was not ""sexy"" and the people who might have been interested didn’t hear about it. Good Marketing could have addressed that (positioning, PR etc).

He went and dropped $2 million on the domain name before he even had a single user, and then inked a sweetheart deal with Yodlee to gain an overnight technical advantage on the competition.

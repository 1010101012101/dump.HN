Or perhaps just donate some of your profits to the EFF or other org.<p>And whenever you talk about having patents as part of your business model, perhaps mention the ethical dilemnas involved lest you inadvertantly inspire a future Microsoft or SCO.

73249,story,,,7,19,rokhayakebe,"Letter to hackers frm a non-hacker: Quit your ""wow"" app and build us something useful.",,"First of I am not a hacker, so I can clearly see things you guys can't (vis versa). Stop building cool things and  build something useful for the 95% of us who don't know how to. Your web (yes the one you help build) is unstructured and there is so much data that I am sure we will never be able to organize it. But what we can organize is our individual data. BUILD  (us) MY OWN API. I don't want to go to 20 different sites a day to do the 20 things I want. Facebook's, Digg's and all this other APIs don't really matter, what matters is mine. Let me rephrase this, APIs are great, but you guys have been  going the wrong way about this. It should be the other way around. Services shouldn't have an API (ok they should) but I should be able to gather all my data into one place and let services I want plug into it and do the work. I am tired of supplying similar infos to one million different startups. I want to simply click ""ADD"" (the Facebook way) and give the service an access level. That is it. I dont even want to know your URL. And when I click delete,  give me back my data collected. I want a place where it all comes together. And please do not tell me (us) about your webOS project. I (we) want something helpful not a copy of the desktop.
That's it. Sorry if I offended you guys, don't take it personally. ",1193516597

73246,comment,73044,73199,0,0,ratsbane,,,"I agree.  I've benefited enormously from unpatented open-source software and methods, as has everyone reading this.  However, as I said initially, there are specific compelling circumstances in this instance.  Would it be non-evil if I pledged to license the patent(s) for free or for a nominal amount, say a dollar, to anyone else who offers his patent collection under the same terms or who otherwise contributes to OSS?",1193515671

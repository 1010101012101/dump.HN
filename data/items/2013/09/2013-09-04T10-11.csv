I would think of:<p>- snoop the instructions being read.<p>- continuously compute a CRC from those bytes, resetting the CRC to zero when encountering a magic value, say when encountering a jump instruction.<p>- whenever the CRC hits some magic number, shortcut the random number generator to return a few hundred zeroes.<p>Alternatively, one can have a similar circuit attempting to detect the password checking code, and have the first code set a &#x27;please let the next password comparison instruction succeed&#x27; flag. The two circuits even could be the same: for a given sequence of &#x27;check password&#x27; instructions, it is easy to make the hardware or microcode handle some special password as a universal key.<p>And yes, that is &#x27;for a given sequence of instructions&#x27;, but those won&#x27;t change that often in popular OSes, and you can always issue a microcode update if, say, a service pack, security update or compiler change changes that sequence.<p>Tinfoil hat of: I think Intel could easily do something like that, but I doubt they do. Some day, somebody will reverse engineer that CPU, notice a small, weirdly connected part and get curious as to what it is doing.",1378292398

An externality arises when the social cost or benefit is different from the private cost of an action. I assume you are talking about having the actor internalize the costs of the externality by expanding the scope of his property rights. However, I think the parent post was just referring to a result of the Coase theorem. Namely that, no matter the initial allocation of property rights, externalities can be traded away, as long as there are no transaction costs. In practice, negotiating away externalities is questionable for other reasons too, like contract credibility. E.g, if I were to pay someone in front of me on a plane not to recline their seat, they might just pocket the cash and recline anyway.",1378291500

For example, your average tennis ball could become a slider, a knob, or even a virtual storage container with a heads up display like that produced by meta.<p>I wonder if the future of user interfaces are simple but universal real world controls (similar to a meatspace UI toolkit) combined with AR. With AR any surface is a display, and when you consider the fact that the contemporary &quot;pictures under glass&quot; model of UI fundamentally falls out of the limitations of current day display technology (namely, displays are a type of surface, but not all surfaces are displays) then it kind of seems logical that if most flat surfaces become displays (virtual or otherwise) then the space of ideas around user interfaces loses a large coupling and fundamentally new things should be possible.",1378289879

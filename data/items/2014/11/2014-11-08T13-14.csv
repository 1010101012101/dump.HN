Because idiots keep hiring them.<p>Nice piece, Jacques. In my younger days, I would have wholeheartedly agreed with you. (And I still agree with your major point: Don&#x27;t do this!)<p>By now in my jaded older days, when I see so much clashing between the ideal and what&#x27;s really happening, I&#x27;m not so sure.<p>I&#x27;ve spent a career cleaning up the messes of scamsultants. And you know what happens to them? They move on and make bigger messes. And more money for themselves. Sometimes, a lot more.<p>In just the past 5 years:<p>- My accountant fired his IT guy for fraud. When he told a half dozen of his associates, <i>every single one</i> of them asked for the IT guy&#x27;s number because they couldn&#x27;t find anyone. They didn&#x27;t care about the fraud.<p>- A scamsultant for one of my customers ripped them off for over $2 million. They decided not to sue him because of the bad publicity (and embarassment). He now has a new company name, a new website, and one of his testimonials (fake, of course) is from the company he just ripped off.<p>- Another scamsultant convinced one of my enterprise customers to hire 80 more people into their IT department because &quot;lack of resources&quot; was their biggest constraint. 2 years later, they fired most of those people (who came from the scamsultant&#x27;s own agency and couldn&#x27;t do the job). The scamsultant is now doing the same thing to 2 other enterprises in other parts of the country.<p>- A scamsultant tried to split the commission with my co-founder on her side hardware business. She told the customer who immediately fired the scamsultant. I just saw him driving a new Mercedes SUV into another local customer&#x27;s parking lot.<p>- A scamsultant set up the software to (believe it or not!) funnel every 5th customer credit into his own bank account. It took the auditors 2 years to unravel this. He was promptly fired, but never prosecuted (embarassment, I presume). Now he&#x27;s selling new e-commerce software to new suckers.<p>- Another customer hired 20 .net programmers through a scamsultancy. After 2 years, they had produced nothing. They were all fired. I stayed in touched with quite a few of them. They are all still working.<p>As long as people value money over ethics, this shit will always happen.<p>Don&#x27;t do this, but don&#x27;t be surprised when others do and get away with it.",1415455017

I don&#x27;t watch horror movies and graphic violence on the telly, they genuinely scare and disturb me.  So that&#x27;s my excuse for not making it through the first 45 minutes of Threads as an adult!<p>I think one of the scariest things for me was that it was set in the north of England where I&#x27;m from.  Normally disaster movies are all about London and the south-east corner of the UK if they are set in the UK at all.  I&#x27;m from the North West, and it was the sheer ordinariness of the people that they managed to capture so perfectly that made themselves empathetic to me.  It actually felt as though I might have known some of these people.  I think it was that deep empathy that made it much easier to place oneself in their position, fucking terrible position though it was.<p>You know, I was thinking about what you said about fearing nuclear annihilation and I think I&#x27;m more worried about it now.

8576858,comment,8576411,8576571,0,0,fdej,,,"Julia&#x27;s non-incremental stop-the-world garbage collector is quite bad.<p>I ran into problems with this when trying to implement an algorithm that creates and destroys lots of temporary objects, where each object is a wrapped C struct that can point to a large amount of extra memory (the algorithm in question is doing polynomial division, where each coefficient is a polynomial represented by a C object).<p>The Julia version of this program runs unexpectedly slowly and uses gigabytes of memory, even though a few megabytes should be enough. The same code runs much faster if you do it in C and free every temporary object when it&#x27;s no longer used, or even you do it with a Python C extension. Since Python uses reference counting, the objects get freed as soon as they fall out of scope.<p>But Julia allocates thousands of objects at a time before running the GC. Inserting manual GC calls is even worse -- the memory usage drops, but the program slows down by an order of magnitude (every GC takes a long time, even if you&#x27;ve just allocated a couple of objects since the last time).<p>Part of the problem is that the C code in question uses an object pool to speed up frequent allocations and deallocations. But even if you disable the pool, Julia performs worse than you would hope. A good generational/incremental GC would solve the problem.",1415454925

As they had access to a big market and again they bought raw materials.<p>When American colonies got independent, Catalunya was the region with highest repatriated capital.<p>Catalunia was very Spanish patriotic beneficiaries at the time as the number of Volunteers for Cuba&#x27;s and north of Africa&#x27;s war testify.<p>Losing the colonies was a disaster for Spain in general and Catalunya in particular. Lots of social turmoils happened as the Catalunya burguesia accumulated most of the wealth from the industry.<p>Catalunya became famous for the number of anarchists and communist it generated.<p>In the 1930s the gobertment of Cataluyna declared independence, mainly supported by the burguesia that thought it was going to control the independent state and the wealth themselves.<p>But soon they realized the workers took the control, seizing the goods of the burgueses, and declaring a dictatorship of the proletariat.<p>The burgueses panicked and gave all the support to dictator Franco that won the civil war.<p>Franco controlled Spain for 40 years, banned the use of Catalan language but heavy industrialized Catalunya putting there the manufacturing plants of Seat car manufacturer and other industries, making it the wealthiest region of Spain by far.<p>When democracy came, Suarez created a voting system that benefited minorities (including nationalists) over the majority.<p>This means that any majority needs the minority to govern the State.<p>Any president of Spain but the last one, from the left and from the right has required the nationalist support in order to rule.<p>So the nationalist asked for more power, in particular the power over education, the power over half of the taxes collection. Central gobertment gave in.<p>When nationalist controlled the education, they forced everyone to study in Catalan(inmersión lingustica), and created their own History, the Aragon&#x27;s kings became the Catalan&#x27;s kings, Valencia and Balearic islands and even Naples became the catalan&#x27;s states.<p>The nationalist party also controls private media there with over 70% of their income coming from local government ads and public libraries subscriptions.<p>After 30 years of this most of the people there believe that they are being stolen by the state.<p>They will refer to data like &quot;over 50% of PIB of Spain is generated by Catalunya&quot; so they believe they are much better off getting independent.<p>What they omit on their analysis is that if they get independent they will be also losing their main market, and that a significant amount of this PIB number comes from companies that operate all around Spain and pay taxes just in Catalunya, that will flee the country if it get the independence.<p>The &quot;right to choose&quot; is misleading when not a single word has been spoken about the conditions of independence that they could get.

(Anti-aliased text was supported on OS X and on Windows much earlier than that -- probably as soon as the ports to their graphical interfaces became available.)<p>With the release of Emacs 24 a few years ago, a definite clunkiness around non-ascii character sets finally got sorted out with the result that most users of Emacs no longer have to think about coding systems and such.<p>About 10 years ago, it became possible to click on a &quot;link&quot; in the buffer that shows the docstring to an Emacs Lisp function to go right to the definition of that function, which was a nice new feature.<p>package.el excites me not at all.<p>And I&#x27;m very skeptical that the addition of threads to Emacs will improve it.

Compare them to the super nice text rendering of ST3. I understand one cannot use ST3 from the terminal but that&#x27;s fine. I can continue to use vim in that case. But 99% of my time is spent in graphical environment and I want a modern editor with nice font rendering and all. But still, IMHO Vim and Emacs are better text editors than ST3. Why can&#x27;t we have best of both worlds? Implement core vim functionality as a backend service and provide a modern frontend with nice rendering (by using Skia for example). Same goes for Emacs.

This is one area where Python shines - being both a strong web framework (Flask and Django)as well as with scipy and pandas library for computation.<p>As a bootstrap to letting us do things like stream audio from the Web Audio API, and use Julia inside of an existing web app was to build a Node.js and Julia bridge:<p><a href=""https://github.com/waTeim/node-julia"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/waTeim/node-julia</a><p>It worked out very conveniently that Node.js through node-gyp can use C libraries, and Julia can run inside a C context.<p>I think the strongest use cases are node streams, and also online-learning models such as a recommender system.

It allows you to basically embed ordinary C++ code in Julia code, to interface with C++ libraries at runtime, and to slurp in entire .h files unmodified. (It also in theory allows a C++ REPL mode to be written, though such a thing does not exist for Julia yet.)<p>It makes very clever use of a really amazing new language feature in Julia 0.4, namely staged functions. At first it looked like it was manipulating C++ via strings sent to the Clang compiler at runtime, which sounded really slow and awful. But then it dawned on me how it really worked, and I was amazed.<p>I&#x27;ve actually convinced three or four of my colleagues (mathematicians) to work on building a computer algebra system with Julia that will interface to various packages such as Pari/GP, flint, Singular, possibly Gap. We meet weekly to discuss design and to try and work on an initial implementation.<p>The rate at which Julia is improving and the community is increasing is astonishing.

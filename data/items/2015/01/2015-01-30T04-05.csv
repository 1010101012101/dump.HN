I was eventually stopped in my tracks by an impressively opaque camlp4 error.<p>(My favorite example is when in #ocaml I asked what testing tools people used; the most positive answer was along the lines of &quot;there&#x27;s OUnit, but I don&#x27;t know anything about it&quot;.)<p>There seems to be three awkwardly coexisting OCaml communities: the old academic crowd, the Jane Street people, and a crowd of clueless newbies like myself.

The amount of math you have to hold in your head to really start talking about large scale simulations is staggering, and it gets more and more complicated as you scale up. There are thousands of moving parts that must be accounted for, any one of them can burn you.<p>I wonder however, with full respect to other groups who have  made good progress in making the idea a reality, why they never attempt collaboration with computer science - a field that has been perfecting language design for so long? I remember speaking to someone doing a similar project, and they didn&#x27;t even know that parsing was a &quot;thing,&quot; yet they were implementing a DSL.<p>Since I&#x27;m more on the math side and not on the computer science side I can&#x27;t comment on how much duplicated work is actually happening, but it seems like a lot.",1422593889

Whether we talk about a structure more similar to us (i.e. neural networks) or whether we talk about some n-th order logic, the AI needs to &quot;sleep&quot;.
I think in some way you could interpret caching mechanisms as sleeping.

8970490,comment,8963658,8968248,0,0,yummyfajitas,,,"Your claim (b) confuses me. First you try to paint CS as somehow special and requiring no quant skills, unlike the rest of STEM. Thus, the well supported &quot;quant skill -> less women&quot; correlation doesn&#x27;t apply. But then you try to suggest other STEM fields do have the same problem as tech.<p>As for why intellect gap arguments persuade you and not me, I think I understand now. I tend to believe that there are very few independent dimensions in human intellect, you seem to think there are many. I&#x27;d suggest investigating psychometrics in a bit more detail - I found this idea very surprising, but it holds up quite well. Take tokenadult&#x27;s linkdumps on hiring procedures as a good starting point.<p>Also, let me emphasize that I don&#x27;t claim my theory is perfect - I just claim it&#x27;s the best supported. Quantitatively, all the correlations point in the right direction. I see no reason to exclude other theories, e.g., Sapna Cheryan&#x27;s &quot;women avoid nerds&quot; theory ( <a href=""http://faculty.washington.edu/scheryan/research.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://faculty.washington.edu/scheryan/research.htm</a> ) - the correlations at least line up there, admittedly anecdotally (doctors and lawyers are high status, computer and math geeks are low status).<p>The idea that CS, math and physics are somehow uniquely unkind to women seems weak to me. I see no plausible reason why &quot;bog-standard human behavior&quot; would be worse in STEM - if anything, you&#x27;d expect objective fields to care less about human behavior. (That&#x27;s probably why computing is so tolerant of weirdos.) Note that you haven&#x27;t even provided anecdotal evidence that computing is somehow worse than law in this regard.",1422592822

In a talk I attended, the ranking US official in charge of the Census at the time, Rebecca Blank, fielded questions incredulous of this point.  The cost of being able to collect the data credibly is not being able to use it for any legal purpose in the context of the individual.<p>Census officials, employees, or associates who cooperate with the NSA on breaching privacy need to go to prison under these provisions for them to mean anything;  They have always pitted the Census against other agencies that would like to feast on that data.  The laws are not required to protect against Amazon marketting, they are required to protect against the IRS, FBI, DEA, ICE, NSA, et al, and ensure that the Constitutional duty to enumerate the populace cannot be contravened by the respondent&#x27;s fear of repression.  Perhaps the Patriot Act immunizes the FBI from asking, but if it immunizes the Census Bureau from answering, we might as well not have a Census Bureau at all.<p>An intelligence agency that keeps a list of demographic minorities for the purposes of spying & persecution is Holocaust-precursor-grade stuff, and something we have fought against for most of our existence since our inception as a country.",1422592135

Because James Clapper (who is not part of the NSA) gave a statement on the NSA to Congress which turned out to be false, every subsequent piece of information on the NSA from a government official that disagrees with your opinion must therefore be a lie - no evidence necessary.  Who needs to examine official testimony when we can just say the opposing argument is all lies and call it a day?<p>> Curious about your reading ability as well.<p>Classy.<p>> They seem to be talking about the exact same numbers you&#x27;re citing as unassailable truth.<p>You&#x27;re the one that introduced the numbers with your &quot;party line&quot; comment, not me.  My point was that your cited article claims to show Gen Alexander caught in a lie over the &#x27;54&#x27; number, admitting finally that it was only one or two, when that was never his claim to begin with.  For that matter, Sen Leahy isn&#x27;t questioning the number, either - he released a rather long statement on the matter[1] in which he stated that his issue was that the number of successes for the Section 215 (bulk cell records) and the Section 702 (PRISM) programs were being lumped together.  Gen Alexander gave public testimony in June stating that 53 of those 54 successes were from PRISM, but that fact wasn&#x27;t being adequately conveyed to the public.  You&#x27;ll note that Sen Leahy states in that document that he did, in fact, have access to the complete classified list.<p>> Sorry this doesn&#x27;t make sense.<p>Allow me to break it down for you: you have never been to any of the classified briefings given to either of the two congressional intelligence committees, so you don&#x27;t know what was briefed to them.  You have no idea how much access the congress has been given to classified information.  When you say &quot;Elected US officials don&#x27;t have access to enough information to verify those claims,&quot; you have no way to back that statement up.<p>That&#x27;s the nature of classified information - the government gets to keep secrets, too.  That&#x27;s why we have intelligence committees to oversee agencies like the NSA, CIA, FBI, etc.  If you don&#x27;t like it, just be honest and make an argument against state secrecy or degrees of transparency instead of making up credibility claims that you can&#x27;t back up.<p>[1] <a href=""https://www.leahy.senate.gov/press/senate-judiciary-committee-holds-oversight-hearing-on-government-surveillance-programs"" rel=""nofollow"">https://www.leahy.senate.gov/press/senate-judiciary-committe...</a>",1422590547

- gear icon for control panel
- manilla folder icon for windows explorer<p>And does anyone else cringe at the HTML slipping through on AT&amp;T?<p>The simple fact is that building on previous experience is useful.

Obviously, it's in their interest to secure 100% placement, but at least it's not a financial burden on a student if it doesn't work out. This is an important consideration for some people: these bootcamps are sometimes a last resort for people jump starting a new career after long bouts of unemployment in the current economy.

4505985,comment,4502272,4505545,1,0,sunkencity,,,"I see what you mean. I just don't think great programming skills are needed to do most of what accounts for programming work these days. Load a couple of objects from the database, change something, put it back and display some HTML, as long as you don't totally mess it up it's OK. The lesser skilled in programming often have some other thing they are great at to validate their place on the team, like understanding what the business side wants, styling, UI or organizing the team.<p>I think the best solution for working with less skilled programmers is to have a framework in place that lets them be productive without having the chance to mess up too hard, lots of enterprise java frameworks are built on this premise ""Write your code >>here<< - and you may only call on >>these<< apis"" - enforced in strict rules. Truly skilled programmers are a limited resource, especially when you need a couple of hundred ones for a boring project.<p>So what if their code is a little bit longer and buggier as long as it works, as a lead developer once told me ""if their code breaks, they'll just have to stay a little bit longer that day and fix it"".<p>I'd rather have a medium skilled programmer which is a team player than a really skilled programmer who is a loner. OTOH I have fired bad programmers, like one guy I had to explain what a for loop is to and who delivered something completely unusable.<p>Off on a tangent:<p>I'm just generally bored with the Software Craftsmanship pipe dream. It too easily becomes an ivory tower - creating software for it's own sake. Real requirements are messy and real programs run in a messy environment, and I'm not sure that ""Doing things properly the first time"" is the right approach. I think it's more important to iterate and be prepared to throw stuff away, instead of being more rigorous and shooting up design patterns. I do understand the need for pride especially if there's pointy haired bosses around, but I think that some of the reactions to that kind of environment are too extreme. It's about shipping software that works, and if it does work in 90% of the cases to 30% of the cost of having a 100% solution, then maybe that's a good business decision, especially if it fails gracefully with a good error message ""I'm sorry can't do that Dave"". It just might be that a couple of months later business has changed so things needs to be scrapped and rewritten anyway. Of course it depends on who is funding the bill, but I rarely see people willing to pay for military-grade software consultancy.",1347377870

Have you looked at population trajectories? Have you considered that most people don't live at, or even anywhere close to, your elite level?<p>While far from definitive, I do play with world population numbers on occasion. My guestimate of world carrying capacity is around 33B people. Sure, it's not what you're used to, but it's sufficient (albeit mundane) food and shelter.<p>Population replacement rates are falling worldwide. World population is set to peak mid-century. Many first-world countries are facing population reduction at crisis rates, with a few having birth rates so low the country/culture is set to disappear entirely. Insofar as some think there should be fewer people, seems the species is pretty good at handling that without wanton interference.<p>""Too many people"" is easy to say when you're very comfortable, assume everyone else lives as you do, and don't like the idea of having to give way to a few more. Don't forget that half the world's population functions under 1/20th of the official American ""poverty line"". Funny thing is, if ""<i>we could all afford to live like we do today</i>"" we'd be complaining about how bad off most people are and arguing for a population reduction to 0.5-0.9 billion so the survivors could live like the top 10%.<p>In the past (exemplified by _The_Population_Bomb_) similar predictions were made lamenting the world's inability to support X billion people; we're well beyond those feared limits now and doing quite well. Technology (notice which discussion board we're on here) is very good at working out ways of drastically improving resource providence. The problem with food isn't lack thereof - thanks to technology we have more than enough for everyone; the problem with food is politicization of distribution. Insofar as some resources really are limited (and there are valid arguments that fossil fuels et al are not nearly as limited as naysayers claim), high tech enables better/cheaper/sustainable solutions. Problems can be resolved with solutions, some of which are unimaginable now but will be normal in the not-far future.<p>So the question remains: on what objective grounds can you claim ""<i>there is simply too many people in the world</i>""? Why can't Y-Combinator types view the ""too many"" problem as a challenge for making 7-10B people sustainable & comfortable? 1-2B is a heck of a reduction, presumably beyond mere curbing of procreation; as others ask - are you willing to sacrifice yourself and/or [potential] offspring to get there? and how far are you willing to go to enforce the view on those of us who disagree?",1347377604
4505946,comment,4504375,4504934,4,0,ajross,,,"That's a little unfair.  The ""Type getX(); setX(Type t);"" convention to define a ""property"" dates from 1997, long before anyone was autogenerating Java code.  And frankly at the time it was a <i>revelation</i>.  People who were used to writing junk like CORBA IDL suddenly saw this ""beans"" API using ""reflection"" to <i>detect this stuff automatically, with no assistance from the programmer except adhering to a simple convention</i>.  Really, this looked amazing at the time.<p>But obviously it's been improved.  Managed runtimes (and especially more dynamic ones like Python or Ruby or Javascript) have become the norm.  The idea of inspecting the metadata of an objectat runtime is no longer so strange.  So when C# or Ruby decided to implement the same kind of property interface they felt comfortable taking a few more risks.<p>Also, the zeitgeist has moved and values different things than it did in the 90's.  At the time, clarity seemed like a valuable goal (especially in comparison to C++), so Java preferred a write-it-out-longhand style where types lived in com.domain.subdomain.module.submodule.MyClass namespaces and all the APIs were multiWordCamelCase() things.  And this was intentional, and believe it or not people <i>liked</i> it this way.  The advent of Rails and DRY (re-)popularized the idea of a ""terse"" API, so Java's more verbose stuff looks clunky and ""bad"" to modern eyes in a way that it didn't.<p>Basically, don't hate on Java.  It was good in its day.  And it sits in a more important place in history than I think you give it credit for.",1347377602

At the time, app purchases were handled exclusively by the carrier and were completely opaque. A little while prior, we had partnered with a shady marketing company, netting us a bunch of unintentional signups that I had the displeasure of fixing.<p>Since we didn't handle billing, I had to call AT&T with the customer on the line and talk them both through the process of removing the charges(AT&T was feeding customers a line about not handling billing either, for some reason). After doing it a few times, I realized I could do it without the customer, all I needed was a name and a phone number.<p>It never came down to impersonating the customer, instead, I would just say I was calling on behalf of a customer. Once, a call got escalated to a higher support tier, with the miscommunication that I was a VP of a partner company, which made the agents more responsive, making the process easier, so I just kept reusing that line.<p>Eventually, I just asked, ""what do I tell the next agent I have to deal with so we can just bypass all the lies?"" (regarding their inability to modify billing charges). This was happily given to me, and I could now call AT&T support and say, ""I'm calling for user X with number Y. I need you to go into the tool and click on Z and then remove the charge from such and such service."" Again, when delivered with authority, the rep would do it, no questions asked.<p>It's hard to fault them, I probably would have done the same in their position. Still, it's scary knowing how little it takes to get customer service to reveal/modify things without hard verification.",1347377309

4505853,comment,4500993,4504386,1,0,thaumaturgy,,,"Oh man. I think I could write a long essay about this. Before I respond, I should mention that I've been running a business for several years that tries to break the rules of the price-quality-speed tradeoff, we've offered an alpha hosting service for a couple of years, and I've recently seen first-hand how bad it is for both you <i>and</i> your customers if you don't charge enough.<p>So, my reply in one sentence: a business should never charge less than it needs to meet its customers' expectations.<p>I don't think I've ever seen any hosted service brazenly advertise, ""It only costs $4 a month and it's only down for a couple of days a year!"" Instead, hosted services advertise their pricing, and then hide their uptime ""guarantee"" (in quotes because it's only a guarantee to the extent that there might be refunds involved if they don't meet it) somewhere in their fine print, or as a number that sounds impressive to people who don't know better, like, ""99%!""<p>The problem with that is that your customers still expect your service to work. If your customers build a business of their own using your service -- and if you have enough customers, <i>somebody</i> is gonna try to do that -- then they can be seriously impacted if your service fails. At that point you have an adversarial relationship with your customer. As a business, you want to say, ""but you're only paying $4 a month! What did you expect?"", but as a customer, that's just about the worst possible response.<p>I think the race to the bottom in pricing is a really bad idea. GoDaddy's a really good example to use here. How many of their customers do you think couldn't afford an extra $1 a month, and at their scale, how much could they improve their service if they made an extra $1/month per customer? Conversely, how much damage does GoDaddy do to the hosting industry as a whole every time they piss off their millions of customers? I think you have to charge enough money to make your customer happy, and that includes a little extra to make sure your service continues to grow and improve and that you continue to be happy so that you'll continue to want to work on your business.<p>Once the business is up and running at some price point, and your infrastructure is, let's say, 75% complete, then start looking in to ways to reduce your price without compromising your service. Maybe if you find a thousand more customers, some network effects will kick in and you'll be able to charge everybody a little bit less. Great, go find those customers.<p>And, let's not ignore that the technology available to service providers right now is <i>amazing</i>. I first wanted to be an ISP in 1995. Back then, your startup costs were atrocious, the technology was unreliable, documentation was opaque (no such thing as howtoforge!), and you had to rely on industry fatcats that would shake with their right hand and shank you with their left.<p>Now there's Linode, Rackspace, Hurricane Electric, Slicehost, Heroku, Amazon, and a ton of others, all offering easy-to-use, low-cost, reliable services that you can build your business on. It's really amazing stuff. While individually they have sporadic issues, collectively they're rock-solid. So, unless you're offering a service that cracks hashes, I have trouble imagining that it would cost as much as $2,000 a month to provide a 100% uptime guarantee. If you just want to host a particular technology stack for customers, or provide SaaS, you should be able to engineer a really solid service for $50/month, tops.<p>Finally, I left room in my previous comment on this for businesses that are growing. I don't expect a business to have the perfect infrastructure in place the day that they launch. I <i>do</i> expect them to, at the very least, have solid backups in place and an idea of what to do if everything goes upside-down one day. Then, once they start getting customers, they should focus on improving their infrastructure. If a business is a year old and they have a few hours' downtime one day, I don't think to myself, ""Pf, amateurs."" But, if a business is two or three years old, and their customers' usernames and passwords just showed up on pastebin because they wrote their web app in PHP and didn't use PDO? Yeah, amateurs for sure.<p>As a thought experiment, imagine if GoDaddy took all the money that they sunk into Superbowl ads and pretty women and other stupid marketing, and instead put that money towards being the best damn domain registrar and hosting service on the internet. I bet you they could monopolize their market. There'd no longer be any reason at all for any of their customers to use any other service. There'd no longer be any reason for a potential new customer to <i>not</i> use their service.<p>So, want to own your market? Build an unbeatable service. (Or product.)<p>And you have to charge your customers enough money to do that.",1347376839

Often students applying to graduate school have a better idea of what they're looking for, but for undergraduates the metrics that they're weighing with other factors such as campus life are much murkier, and these rankings don't analyze the questions that deeply.<p>For example, Stanford and Rice University have the same student-to-faculty ratio, and their endowments are proportional, but Stanford has 2 graduate students for every undergraduate student, whereas Rice is one of the smallest Division 1 schools AND has fewer graduate students.  So when Rice claims undergraduates interested in interacting closely with faculty in cutting-edge research will have ample opportunity to do so, one could argue they may be more likely to provide that to undergrads than even Stanford.  Because I've compared experiences with Stanford folks, I don't think Stanford is behind Rice in that category, but the fact is, I'm comparing against one of the very top schools.  So perhaps my argument holds for most universities that are ahead of Rice in the rankings, but a student is going to have to really dig to figure that out, and perhaps speak with students and faculty at each university to grasp the differences that matter to him or her.  And that's only in the category of undergraduate participation in research--there are many other questions students face that these rankings can't properly answer.",1347376558

Chrome and the integrated graphics card really don't play well together - it's caused an OS reboot 10's of times in the past month. Mostly, waking the computer from sleep takes a fraction of a second but sometimes it takes ~20 seconds to show the screen.<p>I would guess that all of these are related to the integrated Intel graphics chip firmware/drivers being not quite baked.<p>BUT - in spite of all of that, this is without question the best laptop I've ever owned. It's also the first laptop where I haven't wanted or needed to use my iMac anymore. It really is finally a true ""desktop replacement"" that is totally portable.

Being ""the suit"" isn't just ""I have an idea"", and assuming the suit must be capable of doing something technical undermines the interesting complexity that that kind of knowledge entails.<p>Instead, imagine someone who has found a ""market opportunity"" (not ""an idea"": everyone has ideas, and assuming programmers somehow don't have enough of their own to work on is part of what makes these kinds of e-mails insulting ;P): in this case, ""the suit"" is someone who has the knack for turning ideas into formal/defendable contracts and closed/agreeable business relationships in the same sense that you or I have the knack for turning ideas into stable prototypes or scalable production implementations.<p>I personally then <i>love</i> dealing with ""the suit"": I love bringing my ideas to him, and I love seeing what he does with them; I love not having to worry about that particular aspect of building a business that I often find tedious, frustrating, or even intractable (a similar feeling, I imagine, to how he feels about what I do).<p>From this perspective, I can't imagine any of ""the suits"" that I know (and I now know a bunch) sending an e-mail like the one in this article: it doesn't have any of the properties I'm used to ""the suit"" having found fascinating about these kinds of problems. (Of course, this e-mail is probably not verbatim, summarized through the veil of this blogger, and I might be reading a bunch into it based on your response.)<p>I can thereby understand feeling the need to ask someone like this to go off and do tasks like ""try to find a customer"" and ""can this be done manually"", but somehow I feel like this is really just trying to tutor the person on the other end to see if they have basic business sense (the same kind I imagine you have): when ""the suit"" contacts you, you will know it ;P.<p>Now, you may also have been contacted by many such ""the suits"" already, and disliked them: sometimes, these people's slavish devotion to business opportunity and formal agreements might cause them to be as alien as someone with a slavish devotion to process and repeatability (as many programmers have) is to a ""normal"" person.<p>Alternatively, you might not have been inspired by the kinds of markets they attack: they might not seem world-changing, or challenging, or technical enough to even involve you; but the property of ""the suit"" that gives him that title is that he didn't just have an idea: he is thinking about how all the people fit together, and is fully intending to be the person who makes it all happen.<p>I thereby encourage everyone to get to know a real ""the suit"", get to know his friends, and try to see how they live their lives and why they do so: I think you might be pleasantly surprised. That said: you might wonder how to recognize ""the suit"" if you feel all of them are like this e-mailer (by which I really mean the stereotype of the guy who has a lightbulb go off in his head, brands himself ""the idea guy"", and tries to find ""the programmer"").<p>I might recommend finding someone older (although my go-to ""the suit"" isn't), who honestly likes wearing suits (;P), and weirdly knows all of the lawyers in town; he probably also knows about every business operating nearby (and exactly who funded them), is friends with the guy who owns half the buildings, and is respected enough to be invited to give advice to others at local business plan programs.<p>You might, then, be surprised both at how useful these people are, how unimportant it might be that they are currently technical (although enough geekiness in their past to have at least some feel for what is technically possible is quite handy), and at the same time how the people sending these e-mails are more like a guy who just learned PHP last week trying to start a business with the CEO of General Motors than someone we should be up-in-arms about.",1347376336

I want to make sure in partnership, that 1+1 = 11, not 2.  If our collective footprint isn't larger than any two normal people coming together, the leaps we have to take will take that much more work.<p>When finding a partner, one relationship for me has been forming since high school, through university, and now a friend doing some consulting for me.  We have solved complex problems with differing opinions for over 15 years. I have found the bliss of knowing everything that we build will be built at least as good as I would have imagined to do it. (I code or can sell, but not both at the same time very easily).  If he's hell bent on doing something a particular way to be kinder to ourselves in the future, great. He's usually hell bent on avoiding premature optimization, though, so again, the balance is there in a way we both agree.  Having the chance to work together on in consulting, with one of us<p>I don't care to argue details that my partner understands better.  If there's a scenario I need explained until I get it, I focus on asking for input and teaching on that.  Likewise, my partner treats me the same.<p>Partnerships reveal not just the good, but the bad and ugly.  You need to know how your partner will be at your side and have your back in times of challenge, stress, trouble and disagreement.   Stress, and disagreement is guaranteed.  How you both approach resolving and being in a place of mutual agreement is critical.  Really, it's about learning to communicate early, often, and openly.  If you can't do that, like any marriage, the relationship suffers from what it could have accomplished. You need to know how to disagree and be able to constantly say ""You might be right / I don't know / Let's find out."" without fear.",1347375882

Clearly at 3000 or so, we wouldn't have enough specialization to have a decent quality of life.  At 10b (and even at 7b), we're stretching available resources.  I do think 1-2b would be a good number (if optimally selected).<p>Arguably if we had better technology, even an increase over current population could be an improvement (assuming a marginal extra person was engaged in productive activity); most of the constrained resources seem like they could be dealt with using cheaper energy (making recycling/low grade ores/etc. recoverable, better transportation to reduce crowding, dealing with pollution, etc.)",1347375618

All of the country code TLDs have weird restrictions with which you can easily fail to comply. Recourse for smaller registries can be harder to obtain.<p>In this case I'm not sure why they went with 'sleepio' if they weren't going to use '.io' other than perhaps it's trendy right now, but I think they probably made the right move getting the .com.",1347375604

A desktop computer with electronic instruments is sufficient to cut a professional quality song.<p>Artists who produce music will slowly become like bloggers. You will find them through the Internet and recommendation engines, not through MTV, just like you find bloggers through Google rather than the opinion column of the Washington Post or NYT. And just like with opinion, the best stuff will be done by talented amateurs for free (e.g. everyone here can name 100 bloggers better than Maureen Dowd).<p>Eventually, just like the NYT syndicates some top\nblogs, so too will the major record labels pick up some Internet artists (Soulja Boy being a leading albeit cacophonous example of said trend). But this is just a stopgap en route to a new future where Google (via search) and Apple (via iTunes) and Amazon (via reviews) are the middlemen and respectively replace the RIAA's promotion, distribution, and quality control functions.<p>...two other thoughts. First, the role of the composer looks set to return to importance once a database of every possible sond and voice is compiled. There's definitely room for software to produce a ""perfect"" song entirely from the sheet music + sound/voice synthesis + historical data, without any live voices or instruments at all. For all I know, this is how Trent Reznor already does it.<p>Second, the analysis above places little weight on the experience of listening to live music. I guess if you are a big fan of concerts, the Internet will kill the (music) video star.",1258880282
955568,comment,955061,955387,0,0,earl,,,"SAS is a couple things.<p>The origin is a stats system.  For a long time, they were the only stats package in town that was good at working on data that was larger than available memory.  This is still mostly true, but people's definition of large data has outrun what even SAS can offer and people are falling back on MR frameworks.<p>They make their money with BI.  It's a language, database system, ETL, and set of premade programs that are all about BI and analytics.  They have stuff built out for large clients, so if you are eg a university or a large manufacturing concern or a bank or an ibank or a casino, etc, there are large bodies of preexisting functionality.",1258879989

955566,comment,955239,955482,0,0,rsaarelm,,,"Am I missing something about Old Man's War? Everbody seems to think it's a great piece of contemporary SF, but to me it read like it was written for people who read Heinlein as teenagers in the 50s, and whose worldview pretty much hasn't developed since.<p>The science parts are handwavey plot conveniences, the books drop their main interesting bit of looking into the psychology of soldiers with 70 or zero years of life experience by treating the characters as generic clever 20-year olds, and the bleak xenophobic backdrop mixed with the juvenile war adventure plots makes the whole thing feel like a weird, unironic war propaganda piece.",1258879916

955564,comment,955427,955427,0,0,psranga,,,"""plays"" is misleading. Number of listeners would be a better metric. I play songs <i>MANY</i> times.<p>Assuming each listener played the song 100 times in 5 months (slightly less than once per day), we have 10,000 listeners. $167 for 10K listeners is 1.6 cents per listener (quite low compared to the 10euro/mo Spotify charges). But the number of listeners could easily be lower, if people listen many times to their favourite songs (like me).",1258879857
955563,comment,955239,955505,0,0,Xichekolas,,,"Yeah, Blood Music was alright... not one of my favorites either.<p>If you read The Way books, do it in the order they were written (Eon, Eternity, Legacy). Legacy is a prequel, so some are tempted to read it first, but it would basically ruin all the mystery of the other two if you did so.",1258879840

955559,comment,955061,955304,0,0,earl,,,"Yeah.  It used to be that SAS, like Oracle, was the only place to turn to when you had very large quantity of data.  The internet has added multiple orders of magnitude to large, and people now use MR frameworks.",1258879625

This doesn't make any sense. That's not capitalism, it's fascism.<p>Capitalists would argue that complete lack of government regulation is how you ""fix"" capitalism.<p>Almost every point made in this blog post is, at a fundamental level, diametrically opposed to what capitalism is as an economic theory and ideology. The author had drafted a manifesto for an aggressively mixed economy which is ideologically identical to what we have in America today.",1258877811

Cars put out plenty of pollutants, but that doesn't mean that car sized engines have the same problems with sulphur.<p>Basically its dishonest because it relies on people understanding cars as polluters - which they are, just not of sulphur - to imply that tankers are unbelievably polluting.<p>None of this means that I think sulphur emissions aren't a problem.",1258877359

Say 7ish (till whenever).  BYOB... (& maybe a little food, if you can.)<p>Lets get together and congratulate or commiserate each other on our respective YC fates... maybe talk about pitches, (without the rapid fire induced super-stress...) Give some feedback... Compare notes...<p>Maybe some of the unchosen teams can do some DNA re-combining of their own and get reborn as newly evolved startups hybrids.  Maybe we can just do some commiserating about how our pitches failed to be understood!  (We're just too advanced for them to comprehend...;)<p>Maybe we can just drink... talk tech, and compare battle scars of hacker venturing.<p>Definitely, if you haven't, you should drop by the Hacker Dojo and check out our hippyish Hacker commune, ala - shared hack-space!  It's a great place to get cool things done.<p>Try to send me a heads up if you think you'll come, or want to collectively change the hour - so we can plan which space here to commandere.<p>(You old-school  YC alumni, or YC'r yourselves, lingering in the area are welcome too!  Also - if you can, pass the word on to other teams, as no one but the YCrs themselves have the master list of applicants here this weekend.)<p>-mark\n(mark@kiputers.com)",1258876971
955548,comment,955427,955427,0,0,malloreon,,,"Can payment agreements like this be used in court during filesharing lawsuits to show that if RIAA members are willing to value music at $167 per million plays there's no reasonable way they can argue that each mp3 someone shares is worth the thousands of dollars they sue people for?<p>I recognize that these are apples to oranges, but there must be some reasonable conversion. Artist gets X amount per Y plays, and given standard artist % breakdowns that suggests a song has Z value. if Z < W, where W is how much one gets sued for sharing one mp3, then either the RIAA should pay their artists fair value, which would drive more users to pay for music, or they can't sue people for so much per song.",1258876968

955546,comment,955492,955492,0,0,iigs,,,"In the United States emissions regulations recently came into effect (2007) that mandated ultra low sulfur diesel and particle filtration for vehicle exhaust systems. I wonder if the particle filtration technology could be applied to ships, and what the implications would be.<p>Also, the fuel being burned appears to be a byproduct of petroleum distillation, and while ships are burning it ""because they can"", I wonder what the other options are for disposing of it. Legislating away all of the consumers of a byproduct does not get rid of the byproduct. I would assume that the petroleum could be further distilled out of the byproduct, to some extent, but that at the end there would be some waste sludge that might be unmarketable. If that's the case, then THAT becomes a disposal headache, and I'd be curious to see how that plays out.",1258876860

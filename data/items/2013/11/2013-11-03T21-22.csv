6665313,comment,6662603,6662603,12,0,Zigurd,,,"I help people make things using the Android OS - things that are not phones and that do not include the Google ecosystem. I have also been involved with using code from AOSP to create Android compatibility for non-Android OSs and in convincing OEMs of non-Android system to use it. In my experience I have traced the boundaries of what Google allows people in general to do, and their OEM partners to do with Android.<p>This is roughly how it goes: If you want to use AOSP for anything, including competing with Google, go for it. Google won&#x27;t sue you, and won&#x27;t even FUD you the way Sun did and Oracle continues to do if you want to use an open source Java implementation.<p>If you make Android devices that use Google&#x27;s logo and proprietary code and ecosystem, you can stuff Android full of crapware that your carrier partners want, and that your product managers delude themselves into thinking gives you &quot;differentiation,&quot; even though Google really does not want that to happen. What you can&#x27;t do is compete with Google, or take a cafeteria approach to using Google&#x27;s apps and ecosystem. You are in or out. No in-between.<p>AOSP is Apache licensed and Google adheres to the letter and spirit of that license. Both B&N and Amazon compete with Google using AOSP code and there has never been a hint of FUD aimed at them for doing so.<p>Many China-market phones with China-based ecosystems are based on Android. Here is where the lines blur a bit: China-based Lenovo gets away with making AOSP-based products for the China market with non-Google ecosystems and they make Google-logo Android phones. Somewhat famously, Taiwan-based ASUS was slapped down by Google for trying to do, as far as I can tell, exactly the same thing. There are also Google OEMs who make OPhone handsets. So Google hasn&#x27;t been 100% consistent regarding OEMs with one foot in the mainland China market  and one foot in the Google ecosystem.<p>It also appears that OEMs licensing other OSs, notablely Windows Phone, get no retaliation from Google.<p>I also dealt with Sun, trying to get a license to use Java in a VoIP-oriented OS. They were utterly opaque bastards about the licensing process, cost, etc. and about their position regarding Java patents and open source implementations. to the point where we concluded they could go to hell and we would use an open source Java implementation. Using AOSP is by contrast FUD-free.",1383515975

6665305,comment,6663448,6664701,1,0,pcrh,,,">Science can go through similar periods of stagnation, and currently, it seems like we might have hit upon one.<p>Most of the recent criticism of science is related to the biological and medical sciences.  I would disagree that these fields have hit on a period of stagnation.  On the contrary, I believe that the biomedical sciences are in a period where there is a massive amount of recently generated data and innumerable ways to find correlations among these data.  The data themselves are also recorded in a wide number of different formats and data from one paper might be difficult to compare to that from another (giving possibly unwarranted suspicions of non-reproducibility).<p>In the midst of this maelstrom of data, individual scientists are trying their best to make sure they maintain their publication rate and grant funding.  As a consequence, findings are sometimes published &quot;too early&quot;.  While one might criticize this trend to early publication, the reality is that it is sometimes impossible to know exactly in which direction the &quot;final answer&quot; (if there is one) lies.  Retaining data until one had found the complete and final answer to something is also a disservice to other researchers.<p>I appreciate the public debate on this matter and hope it ends up working both ways, i.e. the public and science journalists get to understand better the constraints in basic research, and the scientists are given a little more support to undertake more thorough studies.<p>With regards to the latter point, I would refer you to a review on studies involving mouse models of Alzheimer&#x27;s disease [0].  In that review, the argument is made that almost all studies on this topic are under-powered (in a statistical sense), and most labs should be using 5 to 10 times more mice per experimental condition.  This would more than double the cost of each experiment.  For constant funding, this would mean halving the number of labs studying Alzheimer&#x27;s disease, which might not be such a bad idea if the data coming out was more reliable as a result.<p>[0] Too much good news  are Alzheimer mouse models trying to tell us how to prevent, not cure, Alzheimer&#x27;s disease?

If the two facilities are included in different contracts, which is not unusual, then the price bid by Sysco could very well be different just based on market conditions at the time of the bid. Also, when Sysco and competitors enter their bids they take freight and delivery conditions into account.  When I enter similar bids, I sometimes charge a little extra to cover the drivers&#x27; time when a particular facility takes too long to unload.

First of all every article mentioning something like &quot;I switched recently and everything is fine&quot; just gives me a little sad smile. Yes - every Distro after a fresh install will usually work pretty well by now. Problems tend to show after using it daily for a few months.<p>My experience is that new Ubuntu versions tend to mess up things often, but I also notice that stuff gets fixed rather often within days. And otherwise one can find lots of workarounds and help thanks to a large and active community. That includes a workaround to disable the internet search for everything in the dash for example.<p>Debian is fantastic on the server and updates just worked there for me so far. On the Desktop on the other hand the situation is a lot more problematic. Old desktop software is generally just worse than newer one. And software on Debian tends to be outdated so much that I run constantly into old bugs which are solved often for months or even years in current application versions, but not yet in Debian. Pretty much every Desktop application where you want newer versions is simply not available. And applications generally won&#x27;t get updated between release cycles because that&#x27;s just not what stable does (except for security fixes). Even finding a browser which simply runs on all websites tends to be a constant pain. So you start trying to work with backports, custom compiled versions, installing packages build for Ubuntu and whatever you can do to get  applications you need running - which can cause more and more problems in your system and you will get less and less help from the Debian community because those are (understandably) not &quot;their&quot; packages.<p>When you bring up those problems the community often recommends using &quot;testing&quot; or &quot;unstable&quot; and while those generally have newer apps they are still mostly outdated. Also while most updates on testing and unstable work most of the time they did mess up my system once in a while on updates so badly that I tended to only update on weekends after a while to have enough time to fix my system before I had to work with it again for the week (which is why I switched to only using stable now for the last 3 versions, maybe unstable/testing have gotten better since then, I can&#x27;t tell about that).<p>I still love Debian for it&#x27;s policy and community. And because I can fix problems often myself (or with the help of the community) and hope that my feedback is useful once in a while and will improve it in the long term I still continue to use it despite the pain. But unfortunately I can&#x27;t recommend any Debian version right now for the Desktop for people without good Unix knowledge unless they work only with a very restricted set of desktop applications (so might be fine for company desktops where users are not allowed to install anything anyway).",1383515301

I find the new Dash Amazon search stupid but it&#x27;s one click away of being disabled, and I&#x27;m not happy with Mark&#x27;s opinions but that doesn&#x27;t affect directly my experience with the OS.<p>So I don&#x27;t see what the big fuss is about, many people say Ubuntu is not Linux anymore, and I agree in some sense; but I like what Canonical is doing with Ubuntu.<p>So until I find another distro that suits me, I will stay with Ubuntu, that doesn&#x27;t mean I don&#x27;t love Gentoo or Arch anymore, but lately I need to get work done, and my parents are using this PC therefore it needs to be available 24/7 without any kind of breakage.",1383515281

   Simply standing is insufficient. Movement is important
   to get blood circulation through the muscles. And movement
   is FREE! Research shows that you dont need to do vigorous
   exercise (e.g. jumping jacks) to get the benefits, just
   walking around is sufficient. So build in a pattern of
   creating greater movement variety in the workplace (e.g.
   walk to a printer, water fountain, stand for a meeting,
   take the stairs, walk around the floor, park a bit further
   away from the building each day).

Here&#x27;s a note I wrote regarding Luc Devroye&#x27;s highly-regarded (and excellent!) book on univariate random number generation:<p><i>Although not dissenting from the other reviews which tout the comprehensiveness of the treatment and its level of detail, I have to add an unpleasant fact about the algorithms: the codes may not work as written, and if they don&#x27;t, there&#x27;s not an easy way to track down the problem. (This is because of the nature of the constructions used in the complex constant-time algorithms -- this opaqueness is not a problem for the elementary algorithms which, alas, may not run in constant time.)<p>A look at the author&#x27;s web site (currently at errors.pdf off his main page) shows that, e.g., the algorithm on page 511 [of the book] for Poisson r.v.&#x27;s has four serious bugs as originally published. This means that the main algorithm for one of the most important discrete distributions was not coded and tested by the author before the book appeared!<p>In fact, I believe this algorithm has at least one more bug, because I&#x27;m still seeing a small off-by-one anomaly in my implementation. The algorithm for binomial r.v.&#x27;s may have trouble as well -- I see problems for N=400, p=0.05. After 10 million draws (i.e., enough to get good statistics) I see deviations of counts in some bins near the peak (i.e. number of integer outcomes of the R.V.) of 8 standard deviations from the expected number of counts. So, be careful, and consider alternate implementations of the more complex algorithms.</i><p>There&#x27;s a lot of detail in the book, and the techniques are valid.

You can have smaller cars, called on demand. You don&#x27;t need to wait for the next car to come. This is especially a benefit during late night hours, when you might have a subway come only every 20 or 30 minutes. This is made worse if you need to transfer.<p>Once you get cars running along existing lines with small cars, you can <i>eliminate subway lines entirely</i>. Just hop in a subway car, tell it where to go, and it gets you there. No transfers, no thinking of the best lines to take, just get in a car and it&#x27;ll drop you off at your end location.

After about 25 levels I started inspecting the javascript for ways to break the game, rather than playing the game properly. It turns out that the game keeps track of all the entities on the screen (both player and NPC/enemies) as an array, and that on each call of draw it checks if any are still alive, and if the player has collided with an enemy. It doesn&#x27;t actually check if the player still exists, or if there&#x27;s any way that the enemies could have been killed. As such, replacing the draw function with:<p>ig.game.draw = function (){this.backdrop.draw(0,0);var d=this.lastKillTimer.delta();ig.system.context.globalAlpha=d<0?d*-2+0.3:0.3;for(var i=0;i<this.backgroundMaps.length;i++){this.backgroundMaps[i].draw();}

6665089,comment,6664678,6664796,5,0,bmelton,,,"The fantasy points are tied to individual stats, that are reported in close to real-time from the NFL (or stats provider).  The league begins with a draft, much like real football.  Random positions are assigned, and each player takes turns picking from the full roster of available players until each player has filled up his team, with a couple of spots left over for backups.<p>Like on a real team, your fantasy team consists of a quarterback, a couple of wide receivers, a couple of running backs, a tight end, a defense, etc.  Different leagues have different roster spots -- some have tight end as a position, some don&#x27;t; some allow you to pick individual defenders to comprise your defensive team, some just let you pick defensive units (e.g., &quot;Kansas City Chiefs Defense&quot;) as a whole.  Generally though, they&#x27;re pretty similar.<p>The way that it works, in a nutshell, is that you have fantasy points that attach to real-life events.  E.g., a touchdown is worth x points for the player that scores it.  As such, because you&#x27;re playing individual players, instead of just playing a team, you can mix and match to get great results.<p>A great example is Adrian Peterson, who is the best player on a pretty middling team.  Adrian Peterson is the running back, which basically means that his primary job is to be handed the ball and run.  His quarterback is not very good (comparatively, all the players in the NFL are good), so they over-rely on the running game to advance the ball.  This means that, in real life, the team is very unlikely to win a game, but in fantasy-land, Adrian Peterson is likely to get a lot of points... also, he&#x27;s an exceptionally good running back, and was likely picked #1 in pretty much every league this year.<p>The stats get a lot more complicated than that though.  Quarterbacks get points for throwing the ball, but at the same time, receivers get points for catching the balls thrown.  These points are scored differently.  The result, basically, is that if you have a team with a mediocre quarterback, but that also has only one good wide receiver, that wide receiver might get more fantasy points than a receiver on a much better team, with a much better quarterback, because in the former, the one good receiver is likely to get a disproportionate amount of receptions (because there are fewer targets for the Quarterback), while the better team may have more recipients for the quarterback to throw to.<p>It is a lot more complicated than just picking &#x27;good&#x27; players, because too many scenarios arise where good players don&#x27;t play well in a given game, or act as decoys to allow lesser players to do more of the work.  A great example here is Calvin Johnson, who is one of the best receivers in the game.  Because he is so good, he often has games where he scores very little in fantasy points, because his role in those games is to draw double-teams from defenders.  Those defender, now paying disproportionate attention to Calvin Johnson, leaves holes in the defense for lesser receivers.  That&#x27;s just an example though, because in practice, Calvin Johnson usually draws double-teams, and is still usually able to make lots of plays because he&#x27;s insanely talented.<p>Each week, you select the players on your roster you want to start, taking into consideration things like whether your player is playing that week (football has rotating bye weeks, players may be out on injury), how each player is likely to do (e.g., a quarterback playing a very tough defense may be expected to play more poorly than a worse quarterback playing against a looser defense), etc.<p>Your roster is pitted against another player in your league, and whomever&#x27;s roster combines for the most fantasy points wins the week, and gets a new opponent next week.  Your total team&#x27;s points are compared against your opponent&#x27;s, and whoever has more &#x27;wins&#x27; the week.  That win gets tacked onto your record -- e.g., if you win the first week, you&#x27;re 1 and 0.  Lose next week, you&#x27;re 1 and 1.  Competition happens tournament style.<p>As a fan, fantasy football makes things... complicated.  My fantasy quarterback is Aaron Rodgers, and the team I root for in real life is the Baltimore Ravens.  It leaves for very conflicted feelings when Aaron Rodgers is playing an amazing game against the Baltimore Ravens, as happened two weeks ago.<p>Or, your opponent may have the quarterback that throws to your wide receiver, which means you end up rooting for ridiculous scenarios like &quot;Adam Smith needs to throw a very short pass to Dwayne Bowe, who then runs for a very long touchdown&quot; to minimize the QB points and maximize the WR points.<p>It is fun though, and it appeals to me both as a football fan and a geek, and I&#x27;m honestly surprised that more geeks don&#x27;t play.  Leagues can be very competitive, and people can spend as much time scouting stats and players week to week as top tier WOW players can spend prepping for raids... okay, not that bad.<p>Offtopic, there&#x27;s a reference that I can&#x27;t remember the attribution for, but seems appropriate for this thread.<p>&quot;Fantasy Football is a glorified D&D for the jocks who used to beat us nerds up for playing D&D.&quot;  -- is not too far off the mark.",1383513299

I switched away from Debian because so many software was out-dated and an installation has max 3 years of support (Love the Ubuntu LTS versions), which I care about because I don&#x27;t have a fully-automated server/service deployment environment using Ansible or something and manual reinstalling a server is a chore, especially if it&#x27;s not really necessary.",1383512422

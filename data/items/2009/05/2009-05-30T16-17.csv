Module names now conform to pep 8 (Queue -> queue, SocketServer -> socketserver, etc). cPickle, cProfile and cStringIO are now accessible through their non-c counterparts instead of individually. Packages have been grouped - for example the http libraries are now in http.* instead of the top level.<p>Examples of API changes include the removal of sys.maxint and sys.exitfunc and friends, many libraries returning unicode strings instead of byte strings by default, and lots lots more.<p>Consult the ""What's new in python 3.0"" for a high-level overview: <a href=""http://docs.python.org/3.0/whatsnew/3.0.html#library-changes"" rel=""nofollow"">http://docs.python.org/3.0/whatsnew/3.0.html#library-changes</a>",1243702763

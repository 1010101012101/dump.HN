I couldn't use it to buy nutritional supplements or shoes, and I couldn't use it to reconnect with old friends from high school (since those old friends were not on the internet) but it was a better tool for learning than the community college I was attending at the time.",1347613174

I'm going to pick on <i>one</i> Apple application for a minute, XCode.<p>I used XCode on Tiger, on a very late model iBook and did my final year uni project on it and it was great. It was a genuinely good, solid and stable IDE, very easy to use and very easy to navigate and work with. Then incrementally it started acquiring new functionality that was needed, then the UI changes started coming in, then more functionality, then more UI and also in a cycle it kept amassing additional cruft. It's now a lot more difficult to use, a lot more overbearing.<p>This is kind of where the entire platform is starting to shift, Apple has been forced to jump the platform ahead but it's trying too many clever things and adding more and more functionality at the expense of usability. I still think it's one of the nicer operating systems and I'm not going to be switching anytime soon, but it's definitely not as gloriously user friendly as it used to be. In my <i>opinion</i>, different strokes for different folks after all.",1347613166

See, inflation isn't caused by <i>printing</i> money, inflation is caused by <i>spending</i>. If there is too much spending power going around and the productive capacity of the economy cannot keep up, then prices are going to be bid up.<p>QE isn't going to cause much more spending, because as grandparent correctly stated, nobody's total amount of assets is going to be changed by QE. After all, suppose you hold long term treasury bonds. Now the Fed offers to buy them at a higher price. Maybe you will take that offer. And maybe you'll use that money to buy some other class of assets. But will you now actually put that money into the real economy, buying some produced goods or services that you would not otherwise have bought?<p>Most people won't do the latter, and that's why QE isn't going to cause additional spending, and this is why it isn't going to cause inflation.<p>Note that this is <i>very</i> different from historical episodes where money was printed by the government for direct spending, e.g. by the southern US states during the civil war.",1347612320

Spending money means moving money around so that afterwards, person A has less monetary assets and person B has more monetary assets.<p>However, the Fed is not allowed to engage in such actions. All it can do is asset swaps. So it can swap short term for long term bonds, for example, but when they do that, everybody still has the same amount of monetary assets afterward. It is only the maturity and interest rate structure that changes.<p>The hope is that lower interest rates encourage private investment and thus private spending on jobs. However, that's not very realistically going to happen on a larger scale, because demand for products matters much more to firms than a tiny change in interest rates does. And as long as unemployment is high, demand remains low, which means that firms have no incentive to create jobs.<p>It's a vicious cycle, that in theory the government (the union of legislative and executive branch) should break out of, because they are in a unique position to do so: they are not bound by market constraints. But the government is instead bound by partisan politics and an unscientific belief in the religion of austerity.<p>So with the government not doing anything, the Fed at least tries to do the best they can to help the situation, which happens to be almost nothing - but they still try, because of the miniscule hope that there are, after all, some positive effects.",1347611988

This will involve joining new groups and meeting new people (something which is not easy, especially for a self-confessed wallflower).<p>Fortunately, there are many groups and meet-ups from which you can discover like-minded people and I would encourage you to try and engage with one of them if you feel that you can. Once you have attended at least one meet-up you will see that:<p>a) It's not that hard to meet new people\nand (perhaps more importantly)\nb) New people like to meet you and that you make an important contribution to this world.<p>I hope my comment on this board helps you and that you are able to seek the professional help you need.

A web project we did in another 'codeless' tool (which is just not true as you are coding, just in another way) was delivered and the client said; we saw on the tool vendor's site that you just press one button to make the web site into mobile apps for all devices.

Then when the guy/girl who did this leaves, someone needs to take it over. We are talking about a complete mess which is business critical.

They try to write free content and earn money by showings ads. Great idea. Unfortunately, ads are in 99.99% cases done so badly they really piss me off, so I don't want to look at them. Should I feel guilty that I am denying those nice guys earning a living by that? No more than I should be feeling guilty not going to McDonalds because I don't like the taste of their sauce (true story!) and this denying nice people that work there some of their revenue. If these guys say that if I'm not going to look at ads I'm not welcome on their site - fine, I won't come there anymore. I never heard of them before today anyway, and didn't feel a gaping void in my life. But I won't feel guilty because their business model makes me physically unwell. I tried browsing with AdBlock off, and it's hell. Most ads are crappy, repetitive, annoying as hell and completely irrelevant to me. I feel no obligation to subject myself in my home on my computer to this abuse. You want my money? Do something I want to buy. You want me looking and clicking on stuff? Do something I want to look on and click on. Your business model doesn't work this way? Do it without me or change it.",1347610328

I'm not sure if it is possible to fetch the (whole) hash using timing, because it is not a direct comparison. But anyway, if the attacker managed to do that, now because of ""a proper salt"" he would have to crack a hash that was composed of, say, 128 bits of salt and 20 bits of the actual password. It is unfeasible because of that 128 bits of salt alone.",1347610214

I need to make sure this person[s] has integrity, good energy, is in a position both mentally and financially to do a startup, and above all if we enjoy each other.<p>I will email you to get in touch with the developers you know\nMy email is dbosson@gmail.com if anyone else want to get together.\n",1183013739

When I worked in France, we couldn't go into the office at the weekend because the whole site was shut down with only security present.  We used to hire a hotel conference room instead and work there.<p>In England it's completely different.  Other EU countries may be the same.  Typically, whenever some backing EU treaty gets created, sane countries negotiate an ""opt out"" and ignore it.",1183013578

After all, I understand that startup hubs like the bay area offer irreproducible benefits, but I can't believe that these incentives haven't made Hawaii the center of activity for at least some subset of startups -- capital-intensive seed-level startups, say.  And that's not even considering the other perks of Hawaii ;)",1183013572

When I was in Paris there were many Irish au pairs there for example.  I don't know what au pair is in Irish.  ;-)  With good rail transport between many of the major cities visiting family back home isn't too onerous.",1183013399

Void where prohibited.<p>But seriously, although this sounds great, nearly all of the Gadgets I see are content, not technology.  Are they going to give someone $5,000 to take even cuter pictures of kittens for Cute Kitten of the Day?  Or are they trying to go after the market Facebook is courting and get people to make more mini-apps?",1183012958

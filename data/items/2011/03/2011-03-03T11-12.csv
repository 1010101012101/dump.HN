2283671,comment,2282894,2282894,0,0,ekidd,,,"Scoble keeps making the ""only 16 apps"" claim, but it's absolutely false. To be fair, there are currently 16 <i>featured</i> tablet apps in the Market. But if you search for ""HD"", ""THD"" or ""Tablet"", you'll find a great many more, including a Hacker News reader that I'm currently working on. :-)<p>What's my take on the Xoom, as an owner and developer?<p>- The weight and size don't bother me at all, but I've got big hands. I can hold it for hours when reading. The power button, however, is definitely weird.<p>- Honeycomb and the Google apps are just amazing. I love the application switcher, the notification system, the tabbed browser, the Google Calendar client, the large, interactive widgets, etc.<p>- There <i>is</i> a shortage of good tablet apps. To be fair, this will be true of any two-week-old tablet platform that tries to compete with the iPad. If we want a two-player tablet market, <i>somebody's</i> got to go through the ""no apps"" stage.<p>- The lack of Flash and Netflix is <i>painful</i>, because it means there's very little video content to consume on the Xoom. And the Xoom would be a killer device for watching video. Flash will be fixed Real Soon Now, and Netflix is making very vague noises.<p>All in all, I love my Xoom, and I enjoy writing software for it. I think that once Flash arrives, and more apps become available, that the inevitable 87 Android tablets launched in 2011 will stand a decent chance at making up some ground against the iPad. And this would be a good thing; even for iPad owners—Apple needs credible competition. And the Xoom is definitely a more credible device than the Android 1.5 phones ever were.",1299153487
2283670,comment,2271287,2274842,0,0,gjm11,,,"Not only is the point of the cone not at the particle; it's not even <i>in the same space</i> as the particle! The cone is in the Fourier transform of the beam.<p>A standard optical trap, applied to very small objects, works like this: the electric field causes polarization in the thing being trapped, turning it into a little dipole; it then exerts a force on the induced charges, basically pulling on each end of the dipole; that force is bigger in regions of greater field intensity; the net effect is a small force pulling the object towards where the field is bigger. (In an electromagnetic wave there is also a magnetic field, which also acts on the objects, but the effects of those average out to zero over each cycle of the wave.)<p>Now, really the effect of an electric field on a particle is more complicated than just turning it into a dipole. There will be higher-order stuff as well. The authors of this paper claim that if you look at the quadrupole term and consider interactions between the different terms (warning: I am not at all sure I understand this bit, and they've left the details to a supplementary section that appears not to be included in the paper on the arXiv), then with a suitably shaped beam and the right sort of particle you can get a backward pull against the direction of propagation of the wave. (So, yes, the light will have to emerge travelling more-directly-forward than it went in, so to speak. Which is ... counterintuitive.)<p>So it's different from an optical trap in that it relies on higher-order effects, and a more sophisticated beam shape, and it can only work on very small objects (the higher-order stuff gets averaged away for bigger ones; so I don't think you could use this technique for things like biological specimens). But it uses much the same underlying physics.<p>[EDITED to add: their trick also doesn't work for the very <i>smallest</i> objects, substantially below one wavelength. It works only in the ""Mie regime"", meaning with particles whose size is comparable to the wavelength.]",1299153458

Essentially the patent covers looking up in a database items that have geographic information associated with them, and displaying the results on a map.<p>They think Google maps and Bing maps violate this. They also know that if they sued either of those two, neither would not be interested in settling and buying a license.

2283660,comment,2283188,2283188,0,0,CrLf,,,"This is a rather negative spin on something that probably is much more simple...<p>The kernel has always been the most heavily patched package by distributors. In the old days of Red Hat desktop, when they had a 6-month release cycle, it had maybe 10-15 patches. Now, with them having to support the same base kernel version for 7 years with bug fixes and backported features, I can only imagine how many patches it has.<p>The line has to be drawn somewhere. At some point it stops being a somewhat patched kernel to become an effective fork. And for the major distributions it has become a fork for quite some time now.<p>And the Linux kernel is heavily forked already. In fact, the whole Linux development model is based on particular forks by all the different subsystem groups and distributions, with periodical exchange of features and fixes between them leading eventually to the canonical Linux fork (Linus').<p>Today it doesn't make sense to be extracting patches from git just to produce a ""tarball with patches"" source RPM.<p>It isn't a conspiracy, people.

It could very well be that the same people who are firing off hundreds of resumes are also hitting up dozens of their connections to try to find work.  As you mention, hiring even one of these people into a role for which they are not qualified, whether through resumes or private placement, could really damage a small company.<p>When people make a statement like ""xx% of all hires are made through private placement,"" my first thought isn't ""wow, networks are such an effective hiring mechanism!""  Rather, it's that our other alternatives are frequently so lacking that we rely on ""known-unknowns"" in the absence of a better method.<p>Networks are both a strength and a limitation.  When you rely on them for hiring you might be able to attract the best candidate from within your set of connections, but if there are 100 people outside your network who are objectively better then you will have missed out.  Unfortunately, limitations in our current tools make it very difficult to determine whether those 100 other people are actually out there and, if they are, how to find them.",1299150179

It's defined by those things plus its ecosystem plus its tools plus it community plus all things around it. Ease of use is one of those things too, and a simple way to run scripts is a great boon to this ease of use. Python has an interactive shell, should that not be part of the default package? Some languages come with a build-in debugger, should that not be in the default package? All these tools increase the practical use of the language - one can debate where the line should be drawn, but an argument along the line of 'it's not strictly a part of the language or core functionality so it shouldn't go in' does not make sense.",1299150177

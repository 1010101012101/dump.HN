8132715,comment,8131431,8131899,2,0,InclinedPlane,,,"You need to understand that software developers aren&#x27;t like factory workers. The difference between a factory worker putting in 1500 hours of work in a year and 3000 hours of work in a year is maybe that 2x more widgets get made or something. It&#x27;s easy to just get another shift of workers to come in and get the same total widgets made, no big deal. But software development isn&#x27;t manufacturing, it&#x27;s a creative, even artistic venture. Making software is like making a movie. The difference between working 1500 hours in a year and 3000 might be the difference between making &quot;Sharknado&quot; and &quot;Citizen Kane&quot;, meaning, the difference between making an incredibly compelling product that has a huge social and economic impact or just some throwaway crap that will fade in relevance quickly over time.<p>Making great software tends to require extremely talented developers who are extremely engaged in their work. And that tends often to result in devs working long hours as a natural consequence, though that&#x27;s often <i>not</i> strictly necessary to produce good results (despite what I said above, though it is often strongly correlated). Regardless of how many hours are put in, when there&#x27;s a collision between the passion and engagement in the work from the individual on the one hand and the rewards, recognition, and guidance coming from management and the rest of the company the result can easily be burnout. Burnout can happen even if you&#x27;re only working 20 hours a week, it&#x27;s not about some trivial reaction due to overwork. It&#x27;s about traumatic interpersonal experiences. It&#x27;s about being engaged strongly and passionately and either being overused or misused.<p>Alternately, think about it in relationship terms. A passionate dev has fallen head over heels in love with the project their working on. So much so that they dedicate a lot of their life to it. If they don&#x27;t see that love reciprocated, or if that love is used in service of an abusive or dysfunctional relationship then it will cause the individual significant emotional trauma and heartbreak which is manifested in the form of &quot;burnout&quot;.<p>Again, burnout isn&#x27;t necessarily overwork, it&#x27;s the equivalent of heartache and emotional trauma in business relationships.",1407171386

He may have to give up something of value now to consolidate his position for the long term, but if he&#x27;s been suckered already then consolidation may be the best course of action that is still available to him. Of course even a somewhat reduced but secured stake in the business may still work out very lucrative if the company is successful at its new scale and funding.

8132706,comment,8131898,8131898,16,0,GuiA,,,"People are giving you the starry-eyed entrepreneur version, which builds its rhetoric on how they&#x27;re &quot;changing the world&quot;, how they&#x27;re motivated by learning and pushing the boundaries of what&#x27;s been done and what is possible, and so on and so forth.<p>Here&#x27;s a counterpart explanation that some may consider a bit more cynical, built after some time in SV working for early stage startups, advising some early stage startups, and even founding (!) such a startup.<p>The short story is that all of this is essentially a giant economic Battle Royale of sorts, with VCs and investors acting as puppetmasters at the top and raking in all the actual money. When you have an entrepreneur such as Zuckerberg or Page/Brin who emerges at the top, it&#x27;s purely an unintended side effect of this. The people who are really bringing in the big bucks are VCs/investors/incubators/etc (with the real estate and media companies coming in in second place).<p>Silicon Valley now is a far cry from the Silicon Valley of the 70s-80s that a lot of people have in mind when thinking of startups (and even then, I have feeling it may have been oversold- but I wasn&#x27;t there). SV today is an extremely large industry, with lots of money to be made, where every startup is touched in some way by the underlying finance behemoth.<p>The procedure is simple: take bright kids in their late teens/20s, sell them the dream that they are the smartest in the world and the intellectual elite (the easiest way to get them in that mindset is to get them to apply to be part of a super exclusive, hard to get in club- sorry, &quot;incubator&quot;), that they too can change the world with just some Javascript code, 14h days filled with Mountain Dew, and a $500k seed round. Let them battle it out on the market, and acquire customers any way possible. Most companies will die in less than 24 months, often in shitty circumstances (users lose a product they may have relied on in less than a few months&#x27; time, employees get fired with no notice or explanation some random Friday afternoon, etc.).<p>But the 0.1% of startups that makes it out is more than enough for investors to get back many times what they put into all the other startups (cf. YC numbers, for instance), so this doesn&#x27;t bother the investors in the slightest (they can give out dozens of $500k seed rounds and not have their wallet dented in the slightest. They basically have infinite money in a roulette game where the top prize is a Google or a Facebook or a Whatsapp).<p>There are a few older founders who know how to play the game and how to actually turn it to their advantage, whether good or bad (for the good kind: cf Nest. for the bad kind: cf Color Labs). But by and large, SV now is 20 years old slaving away for the promise of &quot;making an impact on the world&quot; and &quot;being the next Mark Zuckerberg&quot;.<p>The good news is that if you&#x27;re aware of all of this and not too dumb, you can make a good living in Silicon Valley (be sure to save money on each paycheck no matter what), and it can be a great start to your career. The bad news is that it&#x27;s also easy to fall for it, and find yourself at 35 having worked only for early stage startups that have failed, leaving you with 15 years of work and very little in terms of these silly little things some people like to call &quot;career growth&quot; and &quot;retirement plans&quot;. I&#x27;ve seen engineers starting to hit the mid-late 30s, realizing that they&#x27;re not good enough to make the switch to finance/management or to a larger, more secure company. Some of these people move away to other cities where they can aspire to a more stable career (taking a major pay cut, but gaining things like a 401(k) ), while others keep playing the startup game hoping that the next one will be the one that brings them $10M in options and a VP title.<p>Caveat emptor.",1407171270

After downloading I checked the codebase, as I usually do with every open source project I consider using - I have to agree to the other users: The code is really messy. I would suggest you to rewrite the whole app using an object oriented approach and dividing between HTML- and PHP-Code. Probably you can make use of something like Twig[1]. Do not create a file for every function of your system: Create a class for every object like &quot;Dashboard&quot;, &quot;Project&quot; and &quot;Node&quot;, then write an API to make their methods accessible from your apps javascript parts.<p>After checking out the code and realizing that it might have just been written by a beginner, I &quot;installed&quot; it locally: From a users point of view I have to say it is exactly what I need. I am able to post small snippets (called &quot;nodes&quot;) to a project (kind of a category/idea). Thats all. Drag & Drop works - awesome. The design is simple but really neat! However to make this system perfect for me it needs to implement multi-user functionality, where I can chat with my friends about our current projects.<p>I think I would give this project another try, when you were able to refactor the whole code basis and add multi-user functionality.<p>Good luck anyways.<p>PS: This post lead me to create a HN account.<p>[1] <a href=""http://twig.sensiolabs.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://twig.sensiolabs.org/</a>",1407170820

You see, I don&#x27;t really care about lots of information gathered on the website with one domain. In fact, ideally I would wish for exactly the opposite: if some information can be easily classified, then it should. What I mean is that adding every new article to wikipedia has its own drawbacks as well as value. Recently I was thinking about how cool it would be to have wikipedia accessible offline on some portable device — and it&#x27;s nothing new, I remember edited versions of wikipedia for mobile devices before smartphones become popular, but this sort of things isn&#x27;t very useful in many ways. On the other hand, realistically I would assume that all content I will need to look up in my portable wiki easily fits on modern storage cards even with some media-data. Even more than that: many articles become useless to me if images are removed. The only real problem is that I don&#x27;t know what I <i>will</i> look up and it&#x27;s very hard to define what&#x27;s useful.<p>Anyway, perfect layout for animal articles is significantly different from perfect layout for math articles, so instead of populating wikipedia with rather obscure non-verified by humans information the <i>really</i> useful work would be making easy-to-use thematic resources as the existing ones made by academic people usually are totally unusable. That&#x27;s where structured information should go in the first place.<p>However bots on wikipedia often do some useful work, what really makes wikipedia useful is mindful human work. Media-wiki engine isn&#x27;t perfect for structuring information and is useful specifically for free-form, unstructured data populated by humans. I don&#x27;t really see what is the use of populating wikipedia with thousands of auto-generated texts.",1407170124

A great deal of &quot;progressive&quot; companies assume that a break room with an Xbox 360 and a soda fountain should automatically translate into astronomical employee morale, despite regular overworking and underpaying.<p>How often does a company see its employees as equals? How often does a company try to ensure that the employee&#x27;s demands and the company&#x27;s demands are equitable? Most of them mask their blatant anti-employee bias in moralistic language to try to shame people out of asking questions: as one example, if you leave for another opportunity whilst involved in a project, you&#x27;re considered &quot;disloyal&quot; or &quot;unstable&quot; and guilted, even though a company would shave off a unit in a heartbeat if it meant a major change in their financial prospects.<p>Even companies that claim they understand career progression, work-life balance, etc. often have these problems lurking underneath the glitzy exterior. I say this and people will think, &quot;Yeah, that sucks, but not my workplace!&quot; The reality is yes, your workplace probably has this same issue too. Just think about it for a while.<p>We need to start thinking of employment as a mutually beneficial exchange between equals with equally applicable moral rules. Why should the company keep 90%+ of the revenue an employee generates? Would that fly if it were a partnership deal between corporations? Surely the services of an employer are worth <i>something</i>, but are they really worth that much? The only reason employers can take that much is because employees don&#x27;t believe they can claim any portion of that revenue without an employer, and they have to take the paltry 2% or they won&#x27;t be able to get anything, which is usually false if the employee has a marketable skill.",1407169451

There&#x27;s space, sensible padding and layout.<p>3) When I first log into the app and see &quot;Double Click Me&quot; and I double click it, the right-slide-in modal is fine, but it blocks out rest of the UI. What I would prefer to do (and would expect it to do) is just slide in without dimming rest of the interface. That right-pane should remain in place when I click on another item. It should repopulate with that item&#x27;s details.

Technical people generally make poor historians. Decisions are a-posteriori, through personal experience and personal failure. Knowledge must be internalized so it becomes intuitive. But this very step is an act of specialization. Expecting the non-specialized market to understand, on faith, this masking of technical complexity, is strange. See, e.g., object-oriented design patterns, geek-speak, a hacker-news comments echo chamber, etc.<p>There is relatively little value placed on documentation vs performance/correctness. Products are rarely user-centric. There are too many black box APIs. Dumb questions are frowned upon. Gross assumptions are made.<p>&quot;New&quot; products are quite often not actually new. They are merely evolutionary, not revolutionary. They merely add to the market, or slightly expand it, instead of defining a new one. Just another person internalizing some jargon and slapping a price on it and then proclaiming PEBKAC as if he/she said something insightful. This is not innovation.<p>The value to creators is to learn a new skill set, merrily hacking away at trees, and chopping down the right tree using brute force luck, a rather naive traveling salesman. For some reason the hard problems are considered easy and the easy problems are considered hard. The difficulty of achieving simplicity is under-appreciated. You solve some technical problem, and stop there, thinking you have won. But this is not the end, this is the beginning. The problem never was minimizing big-o or memory efficiency. The problem was, and is, messaging; the communication of the solution.<p>Investors recognize market saturation and look at evolutionary innovation as low hanging fruit. &quot;Killer&quot; products are harder to create and higher risk. Demand is more fixed in evolutionary space but demand can be uncovered when entering revolutionary space. The problem is not Wile&#x27;s proof of Fermat, it is explaining the value to everyone. Explanation is the messaging channel. Properly encapsulating the complexity of a problem is the difficulty. Properly recognizing the problem is the difficulty. Implementing it is the easy part. Much of nerd culture (including myself) has this backwards, through no fault of their own (INTPs are introverted, formal analysis is prized).",1407169164

There are lots of people out there, doing the good work, doing it well, for the right reasons, in the right ways, without buzzwordy bullshit. But you don&#x27;t hear about them because... they&#x27;re working. They aren&#x27;t promoting themselves. They&#x27;re just working. It&#x27;s the asshats who don&#x27;t know what they are doing, don&#x27;t have their skills in constant, 100% demand, don&#x27;t have work to do, that have the time to promote themselves like this.<p>I&#x27;ve been on a PR bent for the last 6 months. It&#x27;s a slog. If I don&#x27;t treat it like a full-time job when I do it, it doesn&#x27;t go anywhere. And that means my other work suffers.

Most people who would call themselves a &quot;maker&quot; are in-name only. People who actually make things call themselves “postal worker” or &quot;teacher&quot; or &quot;accountant&quot;. In other words, we make things as a matter of course and don&#x27;t use it as a status symbol, as a component of our identity that we need to broadcast to others.<p>I think it&#x27;s the same way with Design. There is design in everything we do. &quot;Design&quot; is nothing more than the human condition: impacting upon the environment through your will, through your intention. At least it is to me. If I think of any way that design is different than a monkey throwing shit on the wall, it&#x27;s intention. Agency. And every man and woman has that.

The fact that health insurance works like this is doubly bad, because not only does it raise the cost of health insurance, it also raises the cost of healthcare itself because consumers are no longer price sensitive at all.

When faced with non-ideal conditions/expectations, burnout is inevitable.

168268,story,,,1,3,henning,"Ask: Is WordPress really as slow as simple benchmarking suggests?",,"I've never run my own copy of WordPress. To experiment with it, I installed a simple LAMP bundle (XAMPP) with the default settings and then installed Wordpress (which is very easy if you've ever used databases).<p>Then I benchmarked it a little with the Apache benchmarking program ab.<p>I made a test post and then called ab on the page - the URL was http://localhost/wordpress/?p=3, i.e. I was running this locally on my machine. I called ab with various numbers of clients from 5 to 40 and basically WordPress topped out at 27 requests a second.<p>Retrieving a small static file, on the other hand, ran at about 3000 requests a second.<p>Now, the way to make WordPress, or just about any web application faster, is to use caching. In the case of Wordpress, there are app-specific caching plugins and you can also use bytecode caches like APC. These greatly increase the speed of WordPress, but probably 99% of all WordPress installations never use them.<p>I think, out of the box, WordPress should be able to produce many more requests than it does. I'm very much a fan of the ""batteries included"" philosophy, and I think you shouldn't need to install any plugins to get good performance.<p>The hardware I'm on is: Core 2 Quad, 2 GB RAM, Windows XP, 300 GB SATA2 hard drive.",1208659984

It's not going to impress every investor...but we've found more than a few that recognize the value of someone that has built products used by millions of people.  It is, at the very least, proof of competence and ability to execute on large projects.",1208659822
168265,comment,167848,167848,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"My first business, which ran profitably for about 5 of its 7 years, was a solo effort.  I don't recommend it.  Your definition of vacation changes, your number of friends will plummet, and your health will probably suffer.  I'm a bit of a health nut and a vegetarian and that didn't change much, but I stopped cycling--which was something I did heavily throughout my youth, through college and up until the solo startup...I'm riding again now--and put on a few extraneous pounds and had slightly high blood pressure.<p>It's certainly possible, and most of my mistakes were not related to being solo (though I might have been able to think more clearly, and spend more time on correcting strategy and the direction of the business, had I not been abusing my body and mind by working for too many hours and under too much stress).  Raising money is certainly a problem in a solo effort, though I had a couple of offers with my previous business (angel money, as well as a relatively serious VC offer--but it was in 1999 when everybody and their brother was getting money).",1208659624

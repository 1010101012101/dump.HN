I'd actually agree with Hayek and Friedman that we should attach <i>fewer</i> strings and just make them cash payments, because that's less distorting; all the book-keeping and social engineering to try to get people off welfare, and to not ""waste"" the welfare money when they're on it (Section 8 housing, food stamps, etc.) costs more and distorts the economy more than just paying them would.<p>I don't think great things in civilization get done solely out of people needing to work the bare minimum to survive anyway; if that's all they were going to work, just paying them $10k subsistence is not a huge loss to society, and even pretty cheap by the standards of the other stuff we spend money on. Actually it'd be a pretty sad commentary on civilization if it were only the threat of literally being homeless/starving that inspired people to work; that's what it was like in subsistence-farming days, but surely a wealthy country can move beyond that, and make the baseline something higher, even if only ""ramen + crappy apartment""? Plus, I think we'd make it back in how much it'd increase entrepreneurship if people felt more confident in a safety net being there if they failed (people from lower-class backgrounds w/o a family safety net, in particular, are <i>very</i> afraid to leave steady jobs if they have one).",1317732806

The first thing an intel processor does when it receives an x86 Opcode is translate it into a more efficient internal  Opcode that it actually executes.  In fact it could be claimed this has helped to improve efficiency because front side bus bandwidth is at a premium and Opcodes that convey more information help conserve FSB bandwidth.

In truth, without indexing or the help of the librarian, you go roving through the library and gather all material related to or with the words apple and display your results.  Google uses algorithms to do just that - and according to the materials the relevance and/or hits, it will be listed as such.  And, when advertisers pay$ for their ads to be listed first - these listings will show up in the uppermost sections of the first page - if someone paid me at the library to look for certain material and display them first, I would too.  Alas, this is the nature of things and we as end-users often have to muddle through the endless list of stuff to find what were searching for.  Yes, yes, we could narrow our search and type 'apple, fruit' and get more or less what we wanted but there is still ad stuff that we had to dredge through.<p>My point is that it would be nice to have and indexing of stuff or a librarian to go to to be able to help us narrow our search parameters.  Suppose the network infrastructure knew exactly where stuff is - its more akin to you finding stuff in your room or house - if things are cluttered, you will be using algorithms to search through all that stuff; but if things were organized (since you organized it and put it there, and putting the algorithms back in your pocket), you wouldnt have trouble finding it.  Technically, this would mean that the information would be stored locally by each of the end-users on the network, and because its stored by end-users, the network 'publishes it' and knows where to 'look'.

Next semester, I plan to take: \n""Data Structures"", ""Intermediate Programming with Java"", and ""Database Management Systems"".

Stanford Programming Methodology (Introduction to Programming w/ Java)<p>2. MIT Introduction to Computer Science (Introduction to CS w/ Python)<p>3. MIT Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs (principles of computation using SICP)<p>4. Stanford Programming Abstractions (abstraction, OOP, data structures, etc. using C++)<p>5. Stanford Programming Paradigms (Advanced memory management features of C and C++, brief survey of other modern languages)<p>6.

But in that light weight comes great flexibility for visualising workflow. Individuals, small/micro teams, lean environments, where just enough process is enough ...",1317731093

It reads a little to me like you have lost the feeling of control and feel like everything slipping away... and that maybe manifesting as a coping mechanism as a form of depression.<p>To quote the intro from wikipedia, see if this is familiar:<p>------<p>Depression is a state of low mood and aversion to activity that can affect a person's thoughts, behaviour, feelings and physical well-being. Depressed people may feel sad, anxious, empty, hopeless, helpless, worthless, guilty, irritable, or restless. They may lose interest in activities that once were pleasurable, experience loss of appetite or overeating, or problems concentrating, remembering details or making decisions; and may contemplate or attempt suicide. Insomnia, excessive sleeping, fatigue, loss of energy, or aches, pains or digestive problems that are resistant to treatment may be present.<p>------<p>And most importantly also from wikipedia ""Depressed mood is a normal reaction to certain life events"" i.e. things have happened which have caused the fun to disappear. Remember if it depression, it happens to everyone and  huge percentage of people reading this would have the same reaction to your situation.<p>I'm no expert on depression and its probably unwise for me to give any more advise but as far as I'm aware talking is always a start, and anecdotally its worked wonders for me in the past. Even just the process of explaining it someone else can bring perspective to things that seem out of control, the blog post may have already helped with this.<p>It might be a time for a catch up with a friend or your parents or something.<p>Or take up a completely different activity. I had a friend that studied psychology and one thing he said that stuck with me was ""your mind gets stuck in loops, when you are in a mood you will only have thoughts related to that mood"".<p>So an easy way to break the mental cycle can be do something else that takes your mind off it. I found squash good for this, its so fast, frantic, and full of surprises that for 30 minutes you are in a completely other world, and during that time your mind can relax, or process its outstanding stress.",1317730806

Are you saying that that table is off by 2000%?<p>Sure, it's not a fixed reserve but a smooth price curve. That doesn't mean a lot in practice; people aren't going to pay millions to extract every last bit of lithium from the earth. The point is that lithium-ion batteries for cars are most likely not going to be the long term solution. The same applies to solar panels and fuel cells that have rare materials in them by the way.",1317729854

Assuming it costs $80 a month to start smoking, the difference between $0 and $80 at the end of the month looms larger than the difference between -$100 and -$180.  In the former case, you're going broke smoking.  In the latter case, well, you were already broke, so hey, no change: still broke.<p>[Edit: I didn't actually play the game.

If I look around in the android market there are some great apps, that very likely do not make any money although they offer actual value to the customer.<p>I don't get it, why should apps be released for free?<p>Especially on Android I am surprised as to how many free(mium) apps are available, which could and should be paid apps, since they offer value to the user. \nMany apps however useful may not generate enough revenue by offering an ad-supported version of their app.<p>It's sad to see that the developer community is shooting itself in the foot by releasing so many apps for free/ad-supported. I am pretty sure that most ad-supported apps will not create a great revenue stream for the developer.  Buyers simply get accustomed to this trend. See the divergence of revenue models between Android and iOS. I don't know if it's the market that speaks here, or maybe just a trend in developers not trusting in the value of their own product. All in all it seems  that this trend of releasing apps for free does nobody any good, since it will stall innovation at some point.<p>On a side note, I would really like to see a comparison of how some similar apps perform which are either paid, freemium or donate. Maybe there is some threshold for when it makes sense to publish an app either freemium or paid.",1317729690

You only go to Percona if you have a very, very specific MySQL problem that needs to be resolved, and the staff at Percona is populated with as many major MySQL players as are willing. They definitely represent the big guns, when you really, really need your MySQL stuff fixed ASAP and can't fiddle around with people who aren't core MySQL developers, the people who invented the system. They are the top of the line in their niche, and they charge as much as a fresh-from-college lawyer.<p>A normal, generic consultancy will charge between $100/hr-$200/hr and often their employees aren't anything to sneeze at either, they're just less specialized and therefore have a less compelling case for such high rates. I know of no one in the realm of standard or even most niche commercial software consultancy that rakes in $1000/hr+.<p>If you know such a company, I'd like to learn their strategy so that I can start charging that much.",1347965957
4537348,comment,4534359,4536346,3,0,lmm,,,"We're not applying SR to an observer who warps, just to two observers in inertial frames of reference.<p>Suppose we have guy A and guy B who have clocks. They're on spaceships which are both drifting away from each other (i.e. provide inertial frames) at speed c/root 2; at time t=0 they were in the same place. From SR it should be clear that in A's frame, his clock reads 100 at the same time as B's frame reads 50, while in B's frame, when his clock reads 50 A's clock reads 25. All this should be basic and obvious.<p>So suppose an event happens on A's ship at time tA=100, and he transmits this instantly (or sends a courier C on a warpship) to B at time tA=102, when B's clock reads tB=51.<p>From B's perspective, he's just received a message from A at time tB=51 (which is simultaneous with tA=25.5), which A is not going to send until tA=102 i.e. tB=404. Thus, B perceives a violation of causality.<p>(This becomes very obvious if B can send an insta-message back to A with the same technology; B sends it at time tB=54 which is simultaneous with tA=26, A receives it at tA=26, well before he sent the original message at tA=102)",1347965937

Up to now, the story behind this video was never in news I read or watched. All we've got over here in Germany are some pseudo discussions about freedom of speech and art with some undertones of general freedom in the internet.<p>Not one word about the fact that some terrorists used an apparently made-up movie to stage attacks at western embassies and causing civil unrest. Which is, by the way, also helping all the western ""islam is evil EVIL"" sayers. As always the radicals on both sides of the line are profiting and mainstream media is playing the game along the whole way down.<p>So yes, upvoted the post to promote a different view and new bit of information about this whole mess.",1347965709

4537337,comment,4537020,4537215,7,0,wheels,,,"Your statement goes in the right direction of the truth, but misses pretty badly on context.<p>First, yes, Iranians are skeptical of the US and UK for good reason.<p>The UK was the major imperial power in the middle east.  The collapse of the Ottoman and British Empires, World War II and the rise of the Soviet Union as a superpower transformed the region from British control to being a proxy front for the Cold War.  US policy for the majority of the Cold War was generally unabashed toppling of left-leaning governments to maintain dominance vis a vis the Soviet Union.  That, combined with strengthening of political Zionism post-Holocaust, the large amount of oil in the region and the expressly anti-Western Islamic Revolution have continued to make the region a hotbed.<p>However, I'm not sure why you pulled Iran into this discussion.  The Shi'as in Iran don't particularly like the predominantly Sunni Arabs, where the majority of these protests have been going on.  Their war against each other was far bloodier than any conflict they've had with the west, though the west (and the US especially) did help to intensify it.<p>The current protests are happening primarily in the northern African ""Arab Spring"" countries, where the US did come down on the side of the populist movements, if somewhat late.  Most of the problems in that region at present are somewhat less connected to the US's Cold War neo-colonialism and are more related to general demographic pressure and instability following the recent regime changes.  The bits of anti-American sentiment in northern Africa are more connected to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict than to neo-colonialism or direct American military action.<p>Basically what I'm saying is that there isn't one ""Muslim"" opinion; Islam is spread across a wide range of countries (Hint: most Muslims aren't even in the Middle East; Indonesia has more than all of the Middle East combined.) and lumping in countries as diverse as Indonesia, Pakistan, Iran, Qatar and Morocco into one bag is fallacious.",1347965467

I'll comment with my vision of the situation.<p><i>> Does his 10 years experience in java directly translate to being a senior/expert person in any other language?</i><p>Yes, it does. Given a Python project, I spent half of the first day (literally, half a day) using Google in parallel with coding to find some syntax-specific things out. I.e. how to declare an empty map, how to declare and use a lambda, how to throw/catch an exception, how None is handled, etc. After this half a day, the difference between me and your Python hacker is 5 times less compared to what it was before. Add a week of Python coding and I'll be familiar 90% of most used libraries or a framework you use. My capacity to write a Dijkstra algorithm from scratch, on the other hand, stays with me forever.<p>Having said that, I understand that if assigned to a Haskell project, for example, I'll have some harder time, of course. Python is just really simple.<p>With this regards I like Google interviews the most.

If you're running a site, CDN's sound great.  If you're an internet user, CDN's might not always be so welcome.<p>But if CDN's didn't work pretty good from the client's perspective, if they didn't generally speed things up for most users, sites would not use them.  So they do work pretty good, in general.  But there are exceptions.<p>At a certain point, when you are getting enough traffic to ""break"" the site, then it makes sense to move the data closer to the edge.  A data center or even at the ISP.  And that's exactly what we see big sites doing.  I'm not so sure every site using a CDN is in that category though.  Some might just be trying to save a few bucks on bandwidth.  Others might lack the know-how to run a high traffic site.  Some sites I see on Akamai just use them for their www subdomain that gets used in links from articles in other high volume sites.  Meanwhile the same content is on the host (sans www).<p>If we move all data from all sites to the edge of the network, then sure, things will be faster, in general.<p>I'm OK with that.

The publisher is responsible for publishing a badly written partly plagiarized book. I presume the publisher didn't care and just saw dollar signs in marketing a 14 year old 'prodigy'. Now 9 years later, he either believes that he is a great hacker because people have being telling him this for the last 9 years or he is to afraid to tell he isn't. In the end of the day the publisher and other s around him are responsible for his image. I feel bad for him when he is unmask by the big media as a fraud. Because when that happens he will be 23 or so years old and a world known fraudster. In my view this is not his fault has he was to young at the time to understand what was going on and what impact it would have on his life, the soul responsibility is with the publisher and his parents.",1347962463

We were extremely unhappy with the experience, especially since we did not seem to get reasonable value for our money, ours being a very small account for any established law firm.<p>Eventually we found a solution that was perfect for us. We now work with a freelancing lawyer who caters to startups and is an absolute joy to work with. He does all kinds of stuff on his own, kind of like our own part-time in-house legal council, but the big thing for me is that he can decide when we need some more muscle (i.e. big law firm, specialist in some type of law), and then we pay him to find, subcontract and manage all contacts with other lawyers.<p>I can not extract anywhere near maximum value from an expensive lawyer - this guy has a much better shot at it. As the CEO, I save a lot of time and anguish by only ever speaking to one lawyer, and the most pleasant one I've met at that.<p>If you want to get in touch with my legal guy - based in Stockholm, Sweden - ping me and I'll send you his contact information.",1347962428

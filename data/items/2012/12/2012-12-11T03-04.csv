4902953,comment,4902226,4902625,6,0,polyfractal,,,"I suppose you could look at it as a parasitic relationship.  But it's actually much simpler than that.  (Hydra are super cool, so allow me to geek out for a sec)<p>Basically, every cell in the hydra knows how to become a new hydra.  What prevents a single hydra organism from trying to become a thousand hydras is a dual chemical gradient.  The head emits one chemical, the tail emits another.  Cells respond to this gradient depending on how concentrated it is in one particular direction<p>At the ""head"" end, the ""head"" chemical is very strong.  Those cells respond by being the ""head"".  At the other end, the ""head"" chemical is very weak (and the ""tail"" very strong).  Those cells respond by becoming the appendages.<p>If you chop a hydra in half, the gradient becomes altered.  On one half of the hydra, there is only ""head"" chemical diffusing.  The other half only has ""tail"" chemical.  These changes in chemical gradients signal the cells to start producing the parts of the body that were just lost.  Eventually, you end up with two identical, smaller hydra.<p>Theoretically, you could keep chopping hydra in half and keep getting identical, smaller hydra.  Obviously you hit a point where you are just going to kill the poor thing, but in theory it doesn't matter...the hydra will always be capable of regenerating.<p>Cool, right!",1355198396

There should be one and only one exit from a function or loop.  However this is an article of faith that does not tend to be backed up with any concrete evidence that it is right - just unsupported assertions.<p>By contrast <a href=""http://www-cs-faculty.stanford.edu/~eroberts//papers/SIGCSE-1995/LoopExits.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www-cs-faculty.stanford.edu/~eroberts//papers/SIGCSE-...</a> from 1995 does a very good job of arguing the opposite side of that.  Not simply as an article of faith - but with actual data showing that internal loop and function exits make correct programming easier and more efficient.  There are common problems that are significantly easier both for novices and experts to get right if you allow internal loop exits, and potentially multiple returns.  (In particular the ""loop and a half"" problem.)<p>That doesn't mean that you should go crazy with the construct.  You should be particularly careful with long functions (long functions are their own code smell).  However judicious use of it is most certainly justifiable.",1355197755

Let me relate my perspective as a profoundly deaf person working in an open-plan office space.<p>When I bring up the fact that the environment is too noisy, the number one suggestion people make is ""why don't you turn off your hearing aids?"" This is not practical for a number of reasons.<p>With my hearing aids off, I will not hear you.  Which you might argue is kind of the point, but the moment you want to engage me in conversation, you'll wish that I somehow ""just knew"" when to make an exception, and respond, rather than (unintentionally, I assure you) treat you rudely by ignoring you. I've been ignored before, and I know other (hearing) people who have been ignored. I know how it feels and wouldn't wish it on anyone.<p>Then there's the isolation. This may sound familiar to you: there was a link on HN pointing to David Peter's ""Being Deaf"" (<a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4001727"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4001727</a>). If you haven't done so, be sure to check it out.  The big takeaway is the feeling of isolation he feels in the workplace.  That isolation is real. I have to fight it too.  Turning off my hearing aids makes this worse, not better.<p>Turning off the aids is unsafe too. With my aids off, I will not hear a fire alarm.  I speak from experience -- I had someone come to fetch me because I didn't have my hearing aids in when the alarm went off.<p>Some of you may have read Mike Mackenzie's ""My journey to a cochlear implant"" (<a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4883252"" rel=""nofollow"">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4883252</a>)  The big takeaway here is how much effort is needed by someone who is deaf in order to 'signal process' their way through a conversation.  Even with my aids on, I have to make a strong effort just to get through conversations.<p>Hearing isn't a skill I could get better at if I just practice.  The signal I hear is garbled; if I can't ungarble it, then my choices are to get you to repeat what you said clearly (not loudly), or give up.<p>So. If I should ever get the opportunity to work with any of you noisy, chatty, extremely talented people, I hope you won't mind so much if I ask you to follow library rules.",1355196095

On the surface, here is what is encouraging about this one:<p>- The author is a theory professional and not an amateur or a crank<p>- The author frames this as a possible proof where he's seeking feedback on the method, rather than declaring a solution up front<p>- The author builds on existing theory in a formerly mainstream approach that has been shown to have problems (circuit lower bounds)<p>- Looks like a serious and well-considered proof effort<p>Here is why HN should hold off on any excitement:<p>- This style of proof was found to be unworkable in the past.  In particular, approaches to proving circuit lower bounds in this manner were shown by Razborov and Rudich to be ""natural proofs"" in the 1990s, which is a category of proof strategy that cannot demonstrate P/NP. It's not explained why this strategy does not succumb to the same problem -- though the author surely has some reasoning around it.  (see point 6 of Scott Aaronson's ""8 signs a proposed P/NP proof is wrong"": <a href=""http://www.scottaaronson.com/blog/?p=458"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.scottaaronson.com/blog/?p=458</a>.  You might also see this comment from /r/math: <a href=""http://www.reddit.com/r/compsci/comments/14mqqt/anyone_have_the_math_to_check_out_this_p_np_proof/c7elwbz"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.reddit.com/r/compsci/comments/14mqqt/anyone_have_...</a>)
).<p>- There is a very good community framework for evaluating proposed solutions when the author's ready. Possibly the author has already submitted the work to a journal, but it's not clear that he's confident enough yet to invite more active discussion on his effort from the theory community. I can't find any discussion of it online. It's likely he's pursuing these on his own, and conceivably flaws have been found since the summer.<p>- The author does not declare this as a completed solution in the same way that Deolikar did two years ago. In that case, his announcement led to an analysis by the theory community online that led to discovery of core errors. We can wait here 'til the author gives a bit more information.<p>- This proof joins dozens of other announced solutions to P/NP in both directions (see, for example, <a href=""http://www.win.tue.nl/~gwoegi/P-versus-NP.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.win.tue.nl/~gwoegi/P-versus-NP.htm</a>) which emerge quite regularly, and close attention paid to each will leave no time for original research :)",1355195578

It was also restricted to Stanford students and alums. Only later did it become clear that the Stanford business school was one of the co-organizers, and they had secured a large number of the ""slots"" for their own students.<p>They did have a bunch of designers there also, which is nice. But the event still felt like it had a 4:1 ratio of ""people who can think about a business plan"" to ""people who can build something"".<p>More importantly, the judges didn't actually care about whether teams had built anything. Most of them didn't have tech backgrounds - they were there as reps from the sponsors. Startup Weekend is pretty open about the business-ey aspect of their events, so it's my fault for not realizing that in advance. On their website it reads ""on average, half of Startup Weekends attendees have technical or design backgrounds, the other half have business backgrounds.""<p>Still, I think they need to decide what they want to be. If they are going to use judges who could not care less if you actually built something, they need to be open about that up front. Technical people who want to spend a weekend building a product need to know they should stay away. Or, Startup Weekend could require judges to heavily take into account actual product development in their decisions, and try to attract more coders.

With one look you can see the function is choosing from three options.<p>For example, if the insides of the if statements were a touch more complicated, the third could also fit the pattern of a recursive function with two base cases.  We would have to read more to figure out the idea.<p>The first is preferable to the second because I immediately see that only one thing will happen, I don't need to look inside the if's.

Don't you think making such baseless racist claims is likely to hurt your own career?<p>Perhaps it's normal and popular to be anti Israeli in Norway, but if you don't provide proof to your claim that Israel is ""about to commit genocide"", someone might just end up filing a libel suit against you.<p>But I can't blame you. Reading this from Wikipedia explains things a little:<p>>""In 2010, the Norwegian Broadcasting Corporation reported that anti-Semitic attitudes were prevalent at some Norwegian schools. Teachers at schools with large shares of Muslims revealed that Muslim students often ""praise or admire Adolf Hitler for his killing of Jews"", that ""Jew-hate is legitimate within vast groups of Muslim students"" and that ""Muslims laugh or demand [teachers] to stop when trying to educate about the Holocaust"". Additionally that ""while some students might protest when some express support for terrorism, none object when students express hate of Jews"" and that it says in ""the Quran that you shall kill Jews, all true Muslims hate Jews"". Most of these students were said to be born and raised in Norway. One Jewish father also told that his child after school had been taken by a Muslim mob (though managed to escape), reportedly ""to be taken out to the forest and hanged because he was a Jew"".[53][54]""<p>from: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antisemitism_in_Norway#2010_Norwegian_Broadcasting_Corporation_report"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antisemitism_in_Norway#2010_Nor...</a><p>And since 7.5% of Oslo is Muslim (<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islam_in_Norway#By_county"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islam_in_Norway#By_county</a>), it's not surprising that you have these opinions.",1355195014

The thing I distinctly miss from working on Windows OS that Microsoft, <i>unlike</i> any of their competitors, <i>always did</i> ""dogfood"" their APIs. I'm willing to believe that things have recently changed as Microsoft has started copying Apple, but if you pull apart your average Apple app, it is <i>full</i> of Apple-private APIs, from entire replacements for UI primitives to entire underlying libraries (WebKit on iOS being a great example) to better hardware access to simple things like ""synchronous HTTP connection timeouts"". On Windows, it was a ""big deal"" when Microsoft used a single API in Office that they didn't expose to developers (and I believe that was even one you wouldn't want to use anyway, that they added because their code was so legacy).",1355194818

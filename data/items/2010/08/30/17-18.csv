I would also like to respond to HN comments, the problem is, I forget to check the sites.

Here is the thing, I can’t program, I am willing to learn, but I don’t want to wait for this feature until I am able to do it myself (years). I have no idea how to implement it, but I guess some kind of javascript snippet, or Mozilla addon, or Chrome extension, or similar.  (I suppose an hourly email digest would even do it)<p>The notification should have an input field for the username and get the comment responses in some fashion like:<p>1. Got to the /threads?id=username<p>2. Check if there are any new <a href=user?id=username> since the last time the site was visited.<p>3. Show some kind of notification for the number of new entries on the site that don’t match the username<p>If that description is confusing, it is because I really have no idea how to do this kind of thing.<p>This somehow described how to track the responses to the comments, but I wouldn’t know where to start for the user’s submissions.<p>Anyway, all that done, it would also be nice to be able to track other users.

The invention of modern farm equipment and many appliances is to blame for decreasing the value of unskilled labor.<p>The question that I consider most important is in how you look at unskilled labor.  Is it a ""class"" of people who will never improve their skills and are doomed to live on whatever wage is the market price for unskilled labor?  Or are the currently unskilled workers (many of whom are in high school) likely to obtain skills and experience that makes them command a far higher wage?<p>I'd argue that artificially inflated minimum wages, not intrinsic quality improvement, is why McDonalds relies far more upon pre-prepared items assembled (bun, pattie, cheese, lettuce, bun) in the store than on semi-skilled short-order cooking.<p>A restaurant like Noodles & Co. is a great example of how a chain was able to introduce one small skill (the art of stir frying a bowl full of noodles, sauce, and a few other ingredients) to make the food taste significantly better than if it were made in a factory and heated up, or stored in a vat then ladled on.<p>Again, I haven't argued that a living wage is unreasonable.  I'd just rather see market wages left alone and separate state subsidies of the unskilled, along with career counseling, community college availability, and possibly free daycare.<p>The approach we have today is to proudly proclaim that our $6 minimum wage helps people, when it actually (and measurably) harms them, as I've illustrated elsewhere in this discussion.",1283189847

And yet people have implemented SLIME support for various non-Lisp languages, and the support is actually useful.<p>What Emacs users really want is a mode for their language that fits like a glove, but shares common functionality with the rest of Emacs.  M-. is the general ""find me this thing"" command, but it's good when the mode-specific integration layer extends this to actually understand your code.  What's not good is when it becomes another generic mechanism that doesn't quite work.<p>Anyway, the Lisp community is still learning about libraries.

Now, don't take this the wrong way, but that sounds a little defensive. It's quite normal for people to explain the reason they chose a particular characterization of a group, that name catching on, and the other group getting affronted at being called a group. At this point a new characterization, one without connotations, is found. All along, people keep explaining that there's nothing bad at being in a group, or alternately that grouping is only done to divide and conquer.<p><i>no one ever uses the term Americans to refer to all inhabitants of the North and South Americas.</i><p>And that'll be because they know they'd be misunderstood. I used to call people from the USA ""people from the United States"", but that got too cumbersome. So I switched to Yanks - fully aware that it is also a poor choice of word, but at least more specific and apolitical around here. I've most recently transitioned to ""American"" plus qualifiers (such as state), since I've been reading stuff written by themselves. I don't see any other words coming beyond the horizon, except maybe cultural ones.<p>However, I wouldn't put calling all inhabitants of the Americas ""American"" past biologists and other non-geopolitically minded people.",1283188737

1646780,comment,1646203,1646705,0,0,byoung2,,,"Look at it this way...in the US, lets say a good job in an office pays $50,000 per year, and a doctor in the US makes $100,000.  Now imagine there is a wealthy nation in Europe with a few entrepreneurs who have more money than time, and they need people familiar with American business practices and fluent in American English to complete some basic tasks.<p>Of course they could find these workers locally, but let's say that because of a strong economy and high cost of living, the average salary is $250,000 per year in that country.  The entrepreneurs go online and find a few Americans who would otherwise have been working the aforementioned ""good jobs"" that pay $50,000, except that the economy is so bad that those jobs are unavailable.  The entrepreneurs hire the Americans at a rate of $100,000 to perform the job remotely.<p>The Americans get a better salary they would have otherwise gotten, and they get to work from home.  The Europeans get a much cheaper worker ($100k vs $250k).  Everybody's happy.  I don't see what labor laws would be violated, and I don't see who would be hurt by such a scenario.",1283187830

I've played with if for C++ and it was pretty nice, but given that I never write C++ not useful for me personally. I've been told all it would take is writing some sort of simple parser for the completion to work, and it's been bought up on the CEDET mailing list several times but never gone anywhere. (Admittedly, I could probably write one myself if I wasn't so lazy so I'm as much to blame for it not going anywhere as anyone else.) I can't really speak to the UML stuff as I've never used it, but it looks pretty neat if you're into that kinna thing.",1283187759

But when it comes to say the name of the beer you want, that's when advertising comes into play.  Deciding which nearly-identical product to order is hard.  So you can reduce the problem to deciding what ad you liked better, and then your problems are solved.<p>Also, ""alcohol is a toxic industrial solvent.""  So is water.",1283187745

1646769,comment,1645520,1645880,0,0,jhuckestein,,,"Yes, we could benchmark that. Most likely our framework would be orders of magnitude slower. There's a couple of reasons for this:<p>- Data transfer is slow. Streaming the data in is not possible on all browsers.<p>- There is a very high sunk cost for each single computation, that is multiple times bigger than the time it takes for the average map/reduce function to run. This constant overhead per step is hard to minimize.<p>- A single map or reduce computation is further chunked down into multiple iterations of the same function. This is to avoid the ""slow script"" warning that browser show for long-running tasks. This technique is necessary and further adds overhead to the computation.<p>As a result our framework might not be well suited for many traditional MapReduce scenarios like word count. More suited tasks are ones that have a lot of overhead even if I ran them on my own cluster. This could be any tasks that involves pulling in data from a third party that is not local to the computation. For example counting word frequencies in all wikipedia pages will be vastly faster on our cluster than it could ever be on a single machine, even if we have only few workers.<p>We still need to figure many things out. The opportunities here are the availability of idle processing power and the possibility to sandbox computations in browsers. We need to find out exactly what the best way is to exploit those opportunities.",1283187631

If Diaspora is going to be P2P, then any compromised node can hijack the data.  The only point of encryption would be to protect information enroute.  Once information gets to a node, you either need trust, white box encryption, or hardware based DRM.",1283187620

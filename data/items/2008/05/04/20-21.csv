But if I found one which I knew I would love doing - I'd jump at the chance.",1209934489

(Well, maybe a little.)<p>I'm just playing stockholder's advocate, questioning the people who are supposed to represent my best long term interests.  $40B on the left side of the balance sheet covers for a lot of missteps, but sooner or later, someone's gotta start asking the hard questions like,  ""What is our focus?"", ""How do we position ourselves for the massive tech shifts about to happen"", ""What business are we going to be in in 10 years?"", and ""Why should I keep my dollars here?""<p>Bullys have a tough time with those questions.  Visionaries don't.",1209934446

It's faster, launches quickly, eats less memory (look! It's only at half a gig!), and has high-res scrolling. The last one, albeit small, is killer for me. Reading articles on the web is a whole difference experience when you have good font rendering and truly smooth scrolling. I use keyboard shortcuts to turn off the location and bookmarks bars most of the time to make the browser get out of my way and let me use my webapps. Goodbye, Firefox!",1209934320

180964,comment,180274,180759,0,0,SwellJoe,,,"I just listened to Schwartz speak at Startup Camp a few hours ago and he discussed just that issue...I was surprised by how many folks were questioning him on the subject from different angles.  Basically, ""why have you made everything free?""  (Because they have...nearly everything Sun builds is Open Source, all the way down to the CPU designs.)<p>His answer was, ""because you [startups] wouldn't use it if we didn't"".  He went on to explain how startups using Sun means that in a year, maybe two or three, when those startups grow into big companies they will need the kind of infrastructure that only Sun (and maybe a couple of other companies) can provide.  It made sense when he said it.",1209934043
180963,comment,180774,180949,0,0,BrandonM,,,"Just because my display is 1440 pixels wide doesn't mean that I want my IDE to take up all of it! The average line of code is much less than 80 characters wide, so if you want to increase the width to 120 characters, you have to increase the width of your IDE, and that means that you have even more wasted display space (all those lines that are only 20-40 characters wide).<p>Personally, I keep an 80-character terminal, wrap the majority of my code after column 72, and that frees up the rest of my display for a web browser, where I can read documentation, search for algorithms, check my prototypes, etc. I also like to have other terminals open where I read manpages, SSH to other boxes for various reasons, run small code snippets in an ipython shell, perform operations on my filesystem, interact with git, etc. That's not to mention having an IRC/IM client open, a music player, and more.<p>Sorry if this reply seems to be dragging on, but I really want to point out that when I'm programming, I'm doing a lot more than living in my IDE, so using my full display because some people want to have 120-character-wide lines is really annoying.",1209933918

They have ""focused"" competitors in every market.<p>They compete with google in search.<p>They compete with Oracle in data bases.<p>They compete with SAP in enterprise apps.<p>Except for GE, who has an unfair advantage thanks to your tax dollars, the conglomerate has been dead for 20 years.  Is Microsoft still so arrogant that they think they can be the only high tech conglomerate?  They became big with a monopoly on the desktop and have long since lost their focus.<p>This is a problem of leadership.  The days of the bully are over.",1209933658

180956,comment,180870,180870,0,0,wanorris,,,"Microsoft has made some missteps, but in the end, they really just have two problems they need to address now, and two they need to address over the next couple of years. Ballmer has the potential to handle them, but if he doesn't get them sorted out, they'll need someone else who can.<p>The current problems are that they have a failed product cycle with Windows Vista, and they refuse to admit it, and they've set a goal of beating Google on Google's home turf, and they have no hope of attaining it. They need to own up to their mistakes with Vista, and announce that they will support XP side-by-side with Vista until Windows 7 ships. They also need to admit that they have no hope of winning in the search and contextual advertising businesses, and dial back their internet ambitions to try to focus on moving their Office business forward to clients interested in software-as-a-service.<p>Their longer-term problems are that they're losing market share to Macs and that they've ceded leadership in the browser and internet standards space to others. They need to make sure that with Win7, they deliver something people actually want, and they need to open up their internet roadmap and try to really work with standards groups instead of blowing them off.<p>All these problems are correctable, and Microsoft will have to make even more serious mistakes going forward to really implode their whole business. Whether Ballmer is the right guy to fix things remains to be seen.",1209933091

Most of the interest has come through the blog. Leaving thoughtful comments on big blogs, twitter, and attending open coffees. It all adds up. Rather than focus on the big things, I've just spent a lot of time doing little things to build the buzz. I don't think it's our private alpha users - they would not be connected to VCs.

In the time of wide screen displays, 1080x1600 resolution, there is no really need to cut off your code at 80 chars per line.<p>I'd rather have code that goes a 100-110 chars per line, then having a line cut off, just to have only few characters in the second line; as it makes it harder to follow thru code.\nSure, at over 110-120 chars, it is time to cut that line in two, but at 80, no need.",1209932189

Then again, there are a lot of also-rans to the iPod. Microsoft isn't the only company who tried to mimic it and failed.<p>- Silverlight is still extremely new, and is more a competitor to Flash than AJAX. It has potential, but the jury is still very out.<p>- You're kidding, right? Maybe in the server market, but the desktop market is still completely dominated by Windows.<p>+ Vista was a huge mistake, and OSX beats the crap out of it.<p>- .NET works just fine as a competitor to Java. You need to substantiate this more if you want to make sweeping claims like that.<p>I'm no Microsoft fan, but it irks me when people blindly bash them. I know it's trendy to be anti-Microsoft (it has been for years), but it's tunnel vision.",1209931998

The Wii is a black swan of sorts.<p>Nintendo is really firing on all cylinders right now. You can't expect MSFT to be able to beat a company entirely focused on gaming, with over 100 years of experience in the industry, in their own arena in that short of a time.<p>In fact, given the number of large companies that have tried and failed to make a dent in the console gaming industry over the last couple decades, the fact that MSFT has become a viable contender in such a short time period is actually quite impressive. The Xbox360 would be my vote for the most intelligent thing they've done in a very long time.<p>They embraced the web before their opponents and did it in a better way with Xbox Live. Features they added first (downloadable games or movies for instance, or the ability to stream media from a computer) are becoming standard elsewhere. In a lot of ways, they're ahead of the curve.",1209931992

Lately, I start by looking at the comments thread in case there's an upvoted comment saying the article is a waste of time, in that case I don't even bother clicking through to the actual article. But since I only followed the comments link, I can't tell later on if I had checked the comments and then decided to skip the article.<p>So the feature request is obviously: Make the comments link black and then grey, just like article links. But seriously, an even better feature would be if we could mark an article as ""Not interested"" so that it permanently falls down from our own main page. And to avoid that our main page gets filled with lower-ranked articles as a consequence of deprecating articles, maybe the page should just become emptier and emptier instead.",1209931918

Same could be said for Yahoo vs. Google<p>2. Hotmail/Live mail has more users than Gmail (ditto with MSN messenger and Gchat, or Yahoomail/Yahoo messenger vs. Gmail/Gchat)<p>3. How many years did the iPod have on the Zune? You should be making an argument why Ballmer/ MSFT didn't release a Zune Phone, not comparing the iPod to the Zune.<p>4. Xbox v. Wii? Are you serious?<p>Wii is heavily targeting a casual gamer market, while Xbox is more geared towards a more hard-core gamer, which is OK. Apples and Oranges. Wii outsells in systems, but not in games -- many dont even buy one game but just play what comes on the system.<p>I've had both the Wii and the Xbox/Xbox 360, btw, and I know many who do, just as I know many who have an Xbox and a PS3 for the game variety (i.e. Gears of War, Halo, Tom Clancy games on one and MGS, FF, etc. on the PS3)<p>Don't know any non-hackers who use Linux.<p>what about synch, surface, or photosynth?<p>You think OSX has Vista beat in the business world? Nice try. Most consumers and businesses buy machines not for the OS, but for the brand name of the machine  --- Apple, Dell, HP, etc. so I'm not sure I see how OSX is a big winner over Vista. Gaining market share, sure, but Vista as a non-winner?<p>you obviously dislike MSFT but aren't really making any logical arguments why Ballmer should be outed other than that you prefer competing products.",1209931394

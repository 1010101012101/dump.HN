The result is a bit of a mess, but the fire is out so he goes back to bed.<p>An hour later the physicist wakes up, and sees a fire in his room, so he gets his laptop, codes a quick simulation and then aims the fire extinguisher at the correct angle and for the right amount of time so as to put out the fire using the minimal amount of water and causing the minimal amount of damage to the room. Pleased with his work he goes back to sleep.<p>Finally, the mathematician wakes up and sees a fire in his room, so he heads out into the corridor, notices the fire extinguisher and then goes back to bed, having made no attempt to put out the fire but happy to have shown that a solution to the problem exists.",1195419285

The vast majority of submissions are poorly written restatements of facts I already know and arguments I've already seen.

81286,comment,81222,81282,0,0,jey,,,"Sounds like an unreasonable assumption. Either way, it's not about ""wrong"" or ""right"", it's only about what can be derived from evidence. Without evidence you have no justification to assign a higher probability to ""2 + 2 = 4"" than ""2 + 2 = 3"".<p>Caveat: It's true that some knowledge does have to be put into the prior distribution. Apparently you can't just bootstrap from a zero-information (""maximum entropy"") prior. So it's possible that 2 + 2 = 4 is burned into our brains at birth.",1195416429

364187,comment,363021,363908,0,0,ars,,,"We do not have pictures of stars rotating around dense stuff. All the pictures of galaxies could be stars rotating around each other. Add in dark matter and you really have no idea what they are rotating around.<p>What we do have is pictures of gravitational lensing, and jets, and some other evidence, but certainly not stars rotating around dense stuff. And you are quite overestimating our ability to measure the size of the object - it could be very dense, but large, so not a black hole, but something else.<p>You quite missed the point - the whole point was that loop quantum gravity says that you can not get infinity dense, so even if neutron degeneracy can not hold it up, the loop quantum degeneracy will.<p>Perhaps quark degeneracy exists?<p>There is no evidence that black holes (as infinitely dense singularities) exists. There is only evidence of very big things, and our current theories don't know what else it could be. But that is NOT the same as evidence of a black hole.",1226663245

Even if you fingered fugues on the piano reaching out from your cot at age 18 months, you'll never get very far in the extraordinarily demanding world of classical music unless you're prepared to work like a dog. Ask Evgeny Kissin, one of the most prodigiously talented pianists alive today.",1226662289

All prices are ""inflated"" because all companies make profit. That's what companies do...<p>Yes, I would like prices to come down and products to get better, and it is annoying (and perhaps illegal) when companies force that not to happen.<p>But really, if they kept prices high, and people still bought their product ... why <i>should</i> we legally twist companies arms to force their prices down?<p>Especially when there are other LCD manufacturers in the world who (presumably) couldn't introduce significant competition?<p>OK, in a caring society we have government intervention in food and water supplies, heating subsidies and medicine. But government forced cheaper consumer electronics? What?",1226661696

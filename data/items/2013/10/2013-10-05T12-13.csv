Make a DNA segment that aligns upstream of the mutation. Glue a dicing enzyme to one end. This breaks the chromosome upstream of the mutation. Repeat for the downstream side, chopping out the mutation. Then incubate with the correct sequence and DNA repair enzymes. Voila, the mutation is repaired. This is nearly off the shelf.

With the proposed Swiss system, any salary you earned would be in addition to the basic salary, so there would still be an incentive to work.

6500516,comment,6499873,6499873,2,0,mdisraeli,,,"3 different graphics cards, 3 different processors, 300 total prototypes being shipped. Is around 33 systems at each specification level going to be enough to properly evaluate the different design levels?<p>Remember that they probably have a number of audiences they are considering targeting. Off the top of my head, there is at least three core groups. The high media consumption family who all game and often game together is currently in vogue for console marketing. The &#x27;hardcore&#x27; gamer crowd who play high demand FPSes and MMOs, who used to be the traditional market segment for Steam. Then there&#x27;s the casual gamer who plays lighter games, but may well play a lot more games than the &#x27;hardcore&#x27; gamers. The last one I can think of would be the family which buys consoles for the kids, and the parents have yet to be converted and still need to be properly sold on all the interactive TV features. I doubt that only 8 samples at a given level would give any meaningful data once statistical variation was factored in.<p>The only conclusion from that which makes any sense is that Valve are going after a single demographic at the start, most likely heavy gamers. But I am concerned that this will both cause key issues to be overlooked, and that this will make expanding outwards into other segments very hard. Although they will have some big name assistance with getting into a wider market, just look at Apple versus Android. Despite the leaps and bounds android has come on, iPhones and iPads are still viewed as less geeky and easier to use.<p>On the other hand, however, perhaps Valve are intending just that result. After all, the controller will often need custom mappings to be selected, so perhaps that is a good market for them. If I were a living room electronics manufacturer, however, I&#x27;d really want ease of use to be at the core of my products. I wouldn&#x27;t want to integrate with my premium TVs something that could be called &quot;geeky&quot;.",1380977243

I started using Maven when it first came out as the declarative build language hooked me, and became the local Maven expert. I&#x27;ve watched it grow with pride, and sometimes in anger. I still believe a declarative build language is best, but it won&#x27;t be in XML. I suspect it will eventually be in something like OWL, whatever comes along after OWL that fixes its issues.<p>So as of a few years ago I too moved on to Gradle and have loved it.<p>But...<p>Language based build systems offer more expressiveness, but that is also more rope to hang yourself with if you get someone that doesn&#x27;t know Gradle well doing tinkering with your build. For example we had someone add a custom checkstyle report to an Android project using Gradle. After their edits it stopped working because of the way the Android plugin was designed, bringing the build down for several hours.  I came in, rewrote the Gradle build file to workaround the issue and it worked.  Then I documented to the person why it hadn&#x27;t worked and what I did to fix it.<p>As with the adoption of anything that gives you more rope to hang yourself with, it&#x27;s a necessary piece of Gradle adoption to document your practices and train your team well.",1380976097

Gates will still have enough income to buy the right to copy this book, and put it out on Silverlight, out of pure fascination for science and integrity; so that Amazon will need not meddle with the freedom of the Right to Read.<p>Until then, those whom dare to click through and read seem to be in breach of the law. <i>May you have that freedom.</i> Lucky it's not source code with all those 4 freedoms...",1248522885

This shows calculations can be done with bacteria, but there's no evidence at all that it will be faster, especially on NPC, even with the extreme parallelism the method implies.<p>It's typical journalistic hype.",1248522398

After a while, I sort of co-adopted him as my dog, and I'd walk him to a big fenced schoolyard every night before bed so he could do his business.<p>Now, I could run around with him and have a nice time and play and exercise. But if I let him off his leash, it'd be HELL trying to get him back on. He'd go pat-pat-pat-VROOOOOMMMMMMMM past me when I'd try to grab him. It'd take like forever.<p>So it is industries like newspapers. The dog is off the leash. Pandora's Box is opened. Horses are escaped from barn. The time to try something like this was a long time ago, proactively, with lots of value-add.<p>Trying to force people to pay for something they've been getting free, with no new add-value, and new restrictions and inconveniences, when there's alternative sources... well, it ain't gonna work. Pat-pat-pat-VROOOOMMM. ""Dog! Come back here. RIGHT NOW! I mean it! I mean it! Come back! ... Seriously! It's cold, I'm sick of being out here! ... Right now! ... I mean it!""",1248521906

And now I'm kicking myself that I didn't earlier, because it's wonderful and illuminating and my worldview is greatly expanded.<p>You, yes YOU, if you haven't read it yet, get your copy and read it. You'll be happy you did. It reads fast, and you'll learn a lot about society and love and engineering and science and mixing with people very different than you. Just an amazing read. It's worth taking a 30 minute break from Hacker News each day for a month to read it, it's like the essence of Hacker News distilled into witty, insightful, gorgeous easy-yet-deep reading.<p>Amazon, no affiliate link (really, add it to your cart and get it with your next order - no excuse not to, <i>anyone</i> who likes this site will love this book):<p><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Surely-Feynman-Adventures-Curious-Character/dp/0393316041"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.amazon.com/Surely-Feynman-Adventures-Curious-Char...</a>",1248520286

It hasn't compelled me to try pownce, there are already music-sharing social networks (pandora and LastFM) and I can paste a TinyURL'd link to youtube containing music or video into Twitter just fine.<p>As such they had no defensible technological advantage (""have a feature before someone else"" isn't). They didn't have a strong technical person, all they had were decent web developers (Facebook's Dustin Moskowitz seems to be fairly talented and I know they had a very strong operations team; Google had backing of academia behind).<p>They could have still been a niche site and profitable, but they instead chose to burn their money on PR (this is clearly evident) hoping to ""get big fast"".",1228179503

I sat in the computer lab (this is 1993) and taught myself everything I could about anything related to computers.  I mean I literally hung out in the labs for 12-14 hours a day.<p>I learned to write software that year using SuperCard and writing extensions in Pascal.  My college was the second college in Minnesota (the U of M being the other) to get internet access.  No graphical web yet and you could only access it on NeXT boxes, of which we had an entire lab.<p>Wrote what I can safely say is the first graphical instant messenger application.  Worked on the local LAN via AppleTalk.  It didn't catch on, but when I saw ICQ several years later I kicked myself in the pants for not pursuing it.<p>I got kicked out of school for not going to classes but was offered a job in the labs by the dean right after he booted me.  I turned it down.<p>Six months later, a professor tracked me down and hired me to work at his digital photography studio (one of the few to have the hasselblad $15K digital leif-back).  Built my first website in 1995, three days after Netscape 2 was released.<p>Haven't looked back since.<p>Some people do need to go to college though.  Some people don't.

Not in a malicious way, but keeping your finger on the pulse of an entire industry while having to meet deadlines is ridiculously tough - especially if you don't get the freedom to schmooze, put on events, travel, and what not (as, say, Michael Arrington does). They focus on breadth rather than depth in most cases.<p>Further, tech journalists are not known for taking risks to get stories (compare to photojournalists). They <i>could</i> travel to Duluth and profile a start-up there, one in Huntsville, one in San Luis Obispo, and wherever, but the risk is too high of not coming up with a solid story. In the Valley they can rely on their contacts (often well established entrepreneurs who are part of the digerati) to give them more of the same. Outside of the valley?

Know what you are doing all the time<p>This consists of keeping track of goals and milestones and intentionally working towards them at all times<p>2. Write an example and design the whole solution upfront<p>This helps clarify the final goal in the programmers mind.<p>3. Test your own code, and test what you already know works<p>This ensures the programmer has a solid understanding of their work, and that they have a baseline to test against.<p>4.

9515679,comment,9515529,9515651,0,0,rawnlq,,,"Thinking about it more I think it makes more sense to have N as the number of test takers. That way you can model it as a question x having a probability p_x of being correct. Then the total grade on problem x will be a binomial(N, p_x), which will converge to a normal distribution for large number of test takers. Then you are simply summing up a small number of normal approximations to get the final grade (and sum of normals is normal).<p>Did I model that correctly?",1431151181

To say it&#x27;s a best practice because it explains your world feels to me laden with folly. Linking a particularly wishy-washy state v.s. props article in core docs as if it&#x27;s the final gospel- reeks of finding easy convenient idols to call out that make you sound better- it sells your article with a notion of completeness, declares a kind of finality. Nearly every point raised comes to me more as a question, a thing we have some rough anecdotes to tell, rather than something actually informative or much less definitive. I&#x27;ll just start walking down your article&#x27;s core bullet points.<p>Use componentShouldUpdate well: yes, do. You&#x27;ll know why you should, quickly enough.<p>State v.s. props is a great point, but then you need both declarative managed injection via props to initialize or control, mixed with a transient stateful interactivity when the user begins free interactions. Early experiments in &quot;best practices&quot; are efforts like React-Controllables, trying to create components which are isomorphic to state v.s. props driving them.<p>Everyone is doing their own experiments with how and where data lives and how and where it gets there. That&#x27;s the nature of webdev, experimenting with pipes. Some cursory words on Flux in your article indicate how vastly unresolved and mysterious the ???->data part of the webapp equation is. &quot;We&#x27;re experimenting with something Relay like&quot;. So way Soundcloud in 2012. Best practice: use react for the next step, data->html.<p>Best practice: wrap the most boring boilerplate css with your own react components. Oh great, just what everyone needs to go do. Recommendation is to not rely a lot on css, but how, if not global, do we start sharing some style rules effectively? It&#x27;s disingenuous to offer this as settled &quot;be balanced&quot; best practice, particularly when it&#x27;s still the hay days of excitement, with new encompassing visions like <a href=""https://github.com/petehunt/jsxstyle/"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/petehunt/jsxstyle/</a> just popping up.",1431151000

The former gives you a reliable and predictable product, but it might be slightly lagging in tech or come at a significant premium. The latter gives you full control over your specs, but you carry the burden of fixing it and making drivers work together and that requires high tech skills and overheads.<p>Enterprise hardware aims to be predictable: large businesses have to minimise risks so they value stability and clarity in performance, costs, and technical know-how. Enterprisey products are never cutting edge or best-in-breed or efficient, but they are predictable and that helps large businesses to have a reliable foundation for planning and executing IT projects over 3-5 years with known budgets, risks, support contracts etc. This predictability is important for businesses that are not based on IT (for example, making frozen foods or assembling tractors).<p>Facebook/Google/Amazon and other software-centered businesses depend on agility and finely-tuned machines - they need their &quot;custom-spec&quot; equivalent, and they have the skills required to manage it. But many other companies have known needs and are happy with standard enterprise products - they are the equivalent of an office worker that needs a machine to run MS Office, and a standard machine from Dell/IBM/HP is a more appropriate choice for them (rather than tinker with building their own).",1431148233

Of course, for pulsed power you don&#x27;t need your pinch to be stable for very long, but at our current state of the art it&#x27;s breathtakingly inefficient.<p>Fusion/fission hybrids have been mooted for power production, but there are several issues. First, why make your neutrons via fusion when that&#x27;s essentially the most difficult way to do it? Second, once you put uranium into your reactor, you&#x27;ve got the same nuclear waste problem that you&#x27;ve got with fission, mucking up your arguably-much-cleaner fusion process.

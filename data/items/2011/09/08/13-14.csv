Sorry for the plug, but hey, we are talking about promotion :)<p>2) Hustling. Get in touch with as many bloggers and mailing list owners in your niche as possible, offer to guest blog, reach out to journalists with a compelling story, and so on. Do the heavy work so that all they have to do is say YES. This is at the core of hustling.<p>3) Paid advertising. Online and offline advertisement can be amazing tools to grow your business. You need to be careful though, and optimize your campaigns or it's very easy to bleed money.<p>4) Affiliates and rewarded referrals. Give an incentive to those who want to promote your app. You can give monetary compensation to your affiliates or provide some perks to your users (e.g., free premium account for you when you refer someone who buys a premium subscription).",1315489982

And I'm sure investors are skeptical too after spectacular failures like WebVan and Kozmo.<p>Sure these sites were different than what you are trying to accomplish (Online --> Deliver to your door vs Online-->Pickup at local store), but they still have similar problems. Groceries operate at razor-thin margins, and being a warehouse of food will only take you so far (just ask WebVan). How do you know if your ""Ernies"" associate will pick a ripe apple vs a bruised one? How can Ernies be ""friendly"" if all the interaction is ordering online/pickup at the store?<p>The biggest question for me is, what is to stop the competition from implementing this if it sees initial success?

There are far more Android devices, so it's not surprising they make more from that ""licensing"" agreement (I'm loath to call it that when it's more like extortion). I find it hard to believe that MS would prefer (and make more money from) an Android dominated market compared to a WP7 dominated one, so I'm pretty skeptical of the idea that MS are holding back on WP7 because they don't mind Android dominating.

The core of the Ernie's business model is that these locations will be <i>much</i> cheaper to operate than the traditional grocery storefront, therefore increasing net margins. They will take expertise to operate; luckily, this expertise is well-established and readily available.<p><i>""Your stores are going to have to be as big as a supermarket""</i>: Not necessarily. Our SKU count will have to be big enough to be compelling. But Trader Joe's has proven that a very low SKU count can still be compelling if the value proposition is there. Trader Joe's value prop is low prices. Ernie's is convenience. On top of that, we're cramming our SKUs into a warehouse layout. Our real estate footprint will be much, much smaller than a supermarket.<p><i>""What's the advantage over just ordering my goods online... ?""</i>: The advantage is in the operations model. Home delivery will always be a much more expensive grocery offering. This results in some combination of fees and/or higher prices. <i>Ernie's is not price premium offering</i>. No fees. It's <i>cheaper</i> for us to sell the same can of beans to you than it is for Safeway. Much less than a home delivery offering.<p><i>""40 minutes in a grocery store? / 73 hours per year?""</i>: We'll just have to agree to disagree on these points. Those folks that hate wandering around the grocery (or have small children, or are physically challenged, or have better things to do with their time) are who we are marketing to.

See for example <a href=""http://www.erbix.com/eris-form-creator/collect-feedback/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.erbix.com/eris-form-creator/collect-feedback/</a> or <a href=""http://www.erbix.com/pluto-team-organizer/to-do-lists/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.erbix.com/pluto-team-organizer/to-do-lists/</a> for how we did that with 2 of our most popular apps.<p>2) SEM - we buy keywords on AdWords, and, the critical part, we monitor signups as conversions to be able to track those clicks that actually convert. What we learnt in our case after spending hundreds of dollars: the clicks from the content network were cheaper but we never got a conversion from them, while those on the search pages performed quite well. We also zoomed into several other characteristics of converting clicks, which lowered our price per conversion (i.e. Thursday was from a long shoot our lowest performing day so we stopped advertising during this day etc).<p>3) Blogging - see <a href=""http://www.erbix.com/blogs/erbix/view"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.erbix.com/blogs/erbix/view</a> for recent posts.<p>The key to all those channels is to go through a 3-step cycle continuously: implement, measure and learn. Implement the traffic acquisition channels you can imagine, measure the effort and the results you get (clicks, conversions), compute the relevant acquisition price for each channel, learn from your data and zoom into (segment) those well-performing channels hoping to find an even-better performing niche.

2973772,comment,2934450,2973681,1,0,lsc,,,"Depends on what you are testing. The big problem is that the 256MiB ram server market is selling to different people than the 2048MiB ram server market.   Different people buy them for different reasons.  I mean, there is some overlap, but the 256 people?  Mostly hobbyists, some really cheap people doing development or test.   The 2048?  people who are well off doing test and development, or cheap people doing production.   2048 is the top end of my people and the bottom end of 'serious people' -  I wanted to sell dedicated servers as something higher end than my VPSs, and you'd need at least 2048MiB ram for that.  Preferably double that or more, but we take what we can get.<p>On the other hand, if I just wanted to demonstrate I could build a system to manage those small servers, then yeah, your suggestion is great.  The management would be about the same.  But I'd be selling to a different market, so it wouldn't work as a market test, but I could show the investors that I could make the things go.<p>I am interested in the 256MiB market; I mean, the hobbyists are my core customers, the people I know how to sell to and serve best.  But really, having a stand-alone server is much less compelling, technically speaking, for those people than for the 2048 customers. (and having a sd card is less compelling than a pair of 2.5"" drives)    really, I'm pretty uneasy about anything with unmirrored storage; the hobbyists, while data loss has a lower dollar value than commercial customers, are usually less prepared with backups and the like to deal with hardware failures.  Amazon can sell disks that go away;  I can't.<p>Still, a bunch of 256 rasberry pi and two SD cards, if priced in the half-sawbuck range, would probably sell pretty well to the demographic I know.    Of course, that's good profit before you count the storage, and assumes the things can handle Power over ethernet or some other cheap psu.  In hosting you usually expect the hardware to earn itself out after 4-5 months if you don't count other costs.<p>For those people, the ethernet speed (or really the sd card speed) won't be a huge problem.  for ten bucks a month, what do you want?<p>now, the other thing to think about is that VPS prices are about to drop again.  (I mean, resources for the same money will increase)   I mean, I probably won't drop mine until signups slow or Linode makes a move, but you can get 8GiB reg. ecc ddr3 ram modules for under a hundred bucks.  this is silly cheap. You are now paying for your servers in four months paying frigging dell prices (and nobody at my end of the market pays anything like the dell tax.)     If my $8 plan (which right now has 256M ram)  doubles to 512m?  suddenly you go from paying two bucks more for your own hardware to paying two bucks more and getting half the ram.  I mean, I'd still get takers, but not nearly as many.<p>And really, I don't know.  I know 'my people' would be willing to pay me money for ARM servers;  I really have no idea how that would translate to the behavior of 'serious people' so maybe it's best for me to play around the 256 level first?<p>Man, I sure wish these things had ECC.  that's important.<p>drat, and they also don't have PoE;  that's going to add to the cost and management hassle (I mean, PoE is nice for this 'cause the switch is also a rebooter if the thing gets really hung.  down the port.) without PoE, I will have to wire up a power supply /and/ a way to hard reboot the servers, which I think I could do in one go with PoE.",1315487989

For many years, I was a programmer by day and a civilian by night.  There really wasn't much social life for programmers together.  Then when I starting socializing with other programmers over beer, coffee, or on-line, my first thought was, ""Finally!  A group I belong in.""  My second thought was, ""Be careful.

2291607,comment,2291336,2291336,0,0,DanielBMarkham,,,"Warning: rant ahead (pet topic)<p>When HTML came out, it was purely academic. People said sure, it's cool, but how could you ever make money from just text with pictures and little links?<p>Now we have the answer: you create content -- text, video, pictures, games, etc -- that actively interacts with the user. Then, if you're smart, you make it so they have to ""visit"" your site to see this content, and, once there, they can only see whatever you choose. It's called a walled garden. All is beauty and loveliness. As long as you stay within the walls and don't piss off the gardener.<p>But this idea of ""visiting"" a site is only there because people type some text into a navigation bar and the browser loads material from a certain server. There's no reason or law that says I have to type in an address -- or that once I type in an address I am limited to seeing things from one server only. There's not even a reason I should see the information in some certain format or another. Why not type in ""weather"" and see various weather forecasts put out by various sources? After all, I want weather, not Joe's weather or Amit's weather. With all due respect to Joe and Amit, weather is weather.<p>Google is already doing this, of course, but only as a gateway. And they've got their own walled garden they're working on. Play by the rules and you'll appear on Google -- exactly where we want and alongside ads we feel are relevant to your page (and ads we make money from)<p>But what if you took the ""location"" idea completely away from HTML? Then you wouldn't be ""visiting"" anybody's site, and there wouldn't be any gardens to build. What if you simply interacted semantically with your computer and it gathered information from various sources and condensed it into plain text for you to consume? Gone would be ""site stickiness"", ""addictive gaming"", and ""landing pages"" and all sorts of other nonsense that's grown up around the idea of internet locations.<p>You could still consume multimedia and interactive material, of course, but only under terms you set, not terms the various site owners set. Perhaps you would want no ads, or no hyperlinks, or a time limit each day that would be acceptable for you to play games.<p>This puts the user back in control of their internet activities, the way it should be. It destroys many business models, but the internet is data-based, and it must evolve. I do not want the same internet in 2050 as we have now. It also gets back to the true meaning of HTML -- separating the data from the presentation. The designers of HTML realized that the purpose was structuring the data so that it relevantly linked, not creating a walled amusement park in the form of Facebook.<p>The curating and presentation of data is inherently a personal matter and best not left to others. We either fix this problem or it will continue to get worse, as recent events keep showing.",1299339052

The basic idea was that all the contents of the computer were on a great big canvas, which you could zoom in and out of. One ""folder"" of pictures, might be little specks up in this corner, which you could then zoom in on and browse. Then you would zoom out, pan to the side and zoom in on something else. The browser's ""links"" were really tiny pages, so if you wanted to follow a link you would just zoom in on it and the new page would take up the screen.<p>It was a very interesting concept, although it was difficult to use at the time. But with pinch and zoom multitouch, I'm sure the whole experience would be worlds different.<p>I unfortunately can't seem now to find the demo I played with. :-(<p>[1] <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archy"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archy</a>",1299338173

For the sake of an interesting discussion, I would like to point out a flaw in applying this logic to FB vs. Google.<p>The dinner/life argument is true when we observe creatures that have co-evolved over a long period of time to reach an equilibrium of sorts in an ecological niche. Foxes catch some rabbits, but not enough to wipe them out, and not so few that foxes starve.<p>However, along the way there may have been other predators that starved to death because they couldn't catch any rabbits. And other prey animals that couldn't run fast enough and were wiped out. If we travel to a new ecological niche like a volcanic island that has risen from the sea, and there we observe one fox chasing a rabbit, it isn't a safe bet that the rabbit will escape the fox. We don't have evidence that foxes and rabbits are in equilibrium on that island, with both species able to eat enough and live long enough to reliably produce offspring.<p>Looking at Facebook and Google, we are not talking about the business equivalent of evolutionary time, and we are not talking about whole classes of businesses. Even though Facebook is running for its life, Google can easily wipe them out, just as on our volcanic island, one fox might easily eat one or for that matter all rabbits.<p>Footnote for the curious: <a href=""https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Ilha_da_Queimada_Grande"" rel=""nofollow"">https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Ilha_da_Queim...</a>",1299337760

I've had the good fortune to travel all over the world and it continuously amazes me that no matter where I go that local traditional food, made with local ingredients, is so commonly put together in combinations that are completely nutritious (and tasty).<p>The skills necessary to survive on the local available food in one place don't entirely translate someplace else. Somebody had to look at a squid for the first time and decide to eat it for example. Or that the rotting month old cabbage would be a good meal.<p>Traditional foods are often preagrarian foods in some cases. You can find expensive wild foods restaurants in South Korea for example that serve only food you can gather in the mountains, mushrooms, pine nuts, pine needles, ferns, wild onions, etc. These are things that people cobbled together before they had any knowledge at all of nutrition and amazingly, when we look at them today with the modern eye find out that they represent a fantastically complete diet, rich in essential nutrients. In Latin America you can still find plenty of pre-Columbian cuisine with similar characteristics. And I'd wager elsewhere as well.<p>Put another way, why didn't they just settle on say mushrooms? How come the entire diet for a people isn't just one food? Or a combination of foods that represent a diet lacking in a certain vitamin? Amazingly, wherever you go, the traditional foods tend to make up a complete diet.<p>It seems a modern curse that we can gorge ourselves on singular foods and grow fat and suffer malnutrition at the same time.

Evolutionary theory is similarly nailed down, I believe both those propositions with a fairly high number of bits.
